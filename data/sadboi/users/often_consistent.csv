BPDmemes,fj3klk2,t1_fj2lwk4,1582986409.0,"I am so angry at this but I know there is no point in arguing.

This comment is for those of you who aren't spreading stigma, from someone who is happily married to a person with BPD. All I can do is stand up and say that I believe in you.

BPD describes someone who is struggling to survive a very hostile emotional world. It describes someone who is deeply vulnerable to perceived rejection. It describes someone who gets so blindingly overwhelmed at times that their healthy coping mechanisms fail and they turn to destructive coping mechanisms.

What BPD does not describe is whether the person is the kind of person to own up to their mistakes and do what's right even when it hurts like hell. It doesn't tell you whether the person has ever acted out abusively. The diagnosis doesn't tell you whether someone is selfish or generous. It doesn't tell you whether a person is fighting as hard as they can to protect others. It doesn't tell you whether the person is gradually getting better at coping.

So fuck those people who assume the worst on all counts. That's stigma. That's hating people simply because they're diagnosed with a mental illness.

Some people are assholes and some of those assholes have BPD. If an asshole has BPD, their assholery comes out in predictable ways. That doesn't mean that all people with BPD are assholes.

These people don't have a clue about people with BPD in general. So many of these people know and like people who would never reveal their BPD diagnosis because they know it means dealing with this garbage.

You are amazing for fighting and surviving when you know that there are people who will stigmatize you simply because your life is hard. You deserve a fair chance."
BPD,fj2pq0t,t1_fj2m9bw,1582950139.0,"Because you are in couples counseling, that is something that the therapist should be advising you about. The therapist knows the situation, they know whether the timing is right for you to introduce that as something you are asking for in the process of couples counseling, and they can advise you on the most effective way to approach it.

If that fails you, the remaining option is to go to Al-Anon to get the advice of people who have been where you are, struggling to get their loved one into treatment."
BPD,fj2ez6r,t1_fiyvijn,1582941966.0,"I'm a big believer that we can recreate ourselves, not just in the eyes of others, but in the more basic way of who we are in our daily lives.

When we get to the point where we aren't the kind of person who could make the mistakes we've made, then we have every right to forgive ourselves for what we've done."
BPD,fj2cslr,t1_fj27h3y,1582940357.0,"That is 100% normal for someone with BPD until the treatment starts helping.

Have you had people in your life who were truly solid in their support for you? Were they always available when you truly needed them? Did they know how to understand you even when you couldn't explain what was going on? Did you have someone who would help you fix the scary things in your life?

If you haven't had consistent, reliable support, it would be foolish to go through life expecting people to be trustworthy. There is a protective instinct inside you that is helping the best way it knows how, by telling you that it has always been too good to be true no matter how good it feels.

That instinct isn't necessarily wrong, but it is louder and more extreme than you actually need it to be. It became that loud because it is used to being ignored. It needs you to pay attention so you'll stay safe, and you need to keep it from controlling your life and letting it sabotage your relationships.

It sees you getting overly attached and it watches for every possible change that might signal the next rejection. It hopes that it will be able to warn you early enough that you can pull back from the attachment, making it easier to survive the rejection.

This isn't going to change until treatment helps you to feel less vulnerable. When you feel more capable of handling your emotions and using healthy coping skills, you will be less reliant on others to give you support and positive feedback. This is happening because you have a gaping wound where others have a sense that they are worthwhile and wanted."
BPD,fj255oy,t3_faz6kj,1582934800.0,I'm glad you are asking these questions. I don't have any good answers for you but this is a question that would be perfect for r/askatherapist.
BPD,fj1z4ls,t1_fizcfun,1582931048.0,"I'm glad I could help! Let's see what other info I can give you and others who are going through something similar...

Let's suppose that he did get to the place where he was open to treatment. And let's assume that his symptoms did match BPD more closely than they matched other disorders. I would still be extremely hesitant to suggest that anyone approaches a professional with the statement, ""I think he might have BPD.""

One reason why is, BPD suffers a truly nasty stigma that is present even amongst many professionals. For years, amongst those professionals who don't specialize in treating BPD, BPD has come to be a sort of code for, ""That client that you can't stand."" There are a lot of professionals out there who refuse to treat people with BPD because they don't want to deal with the level of difficulty. And it tends to be discussed as if it was the fault of those with BPD for being so caustic or unstable.

This is stigma. It is an unacceptable, unfair way of categorizing people who have the same set of struggles. It has eased significantly as DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) has become widely available and used, because DBT is easy to offer in a group setting and it greatly reduces the acting out behaviors that those professionals fear, making it more comfortable for a professional to treat the remaining issues. But even after completion of DBT, there are some huge challenges that are insurmountable if a therapist doesn't have the training to keep them from taking things personally.

The other reason why I would advise against approaching a therapist with the statement, ""I think he has BPD"" is based in the stigma that the general public has regarding BPD. Even if the treating professional has a positive, helpful attitude toward BPD, they are going to need to inspect whether you mean, ""He is showing cruel behavior that is popularly referred to as borderline or narcissistic behavior"" or, ""I researched BPD and he seems to match both the symptoms and the underlying pathology."" That creates an unnecessary level of difficulty when you could just approach with the particular symptoms and struggles you are experiencing.

So, no, I think it is generally a very bad idea to approach a therapist with the statement, ""I think he has BPD,"" even if he does indeed have BPD.

But, it is still useful to know that BPD is a likely disorder because it helps you to choose a therapist who is likely to be receptive. You can then look for therapists who advertise that they treat BPD. (Hint, that is horribly rare.)

If that doesn't work, you can look for therapists who advertise that they do the particular kinds of treatments that are most effective for BPD. Since you are mostly concerned about the symptoms that affect your relationship, that means DBT, DBT, and DBT.* Anyone who specializes in DBT is going to keep an eye out for BPD. It won't take long for that professional to diagnose BPD if it is there.

\*ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy) can be a reasonable substitute for DBT, but it is harder to find that DBT is. Also, be aware that DBT is not the ultimate solution for BPD. It reduces the observable symptoms, easing the relationship problems, so it is an excellent first step. It doesn't address the unbearable distress behind those symptoms. The person with BPD will need other treatment after they have completed DBT."

BPD,fj1nhw0,t1_fj1mwho,1582923745.0,"Getting back to you in particular, u/milkboii55, the age regression and the dichotomy between good and evil are both more suggestive of DID than they are of BPD-with-healthy-plural-selves because it would be easy to then decide that one is responsible for relationship instability and the other is blameless.

It isn't necessarily DID, though. If the good, age regressed personality retains their own feeling of responsibility for the relationship struggles, it would be more accurate to say that the attachment disorder is relying on a BPD style of coping rather than a DID style of coping."
BPD,fj1mwho,t1_fj1mnhx,1582923399.0,"Someone with DID relies on a set of beliefs that set personalities apart, making it possible for one to take the blame while another is innocent, or making it possible for one to love someone while the other hates that person. Here are more examples of the beliefs you will find prominently in DID but only incidentally in BPD-only (Source, Ross):


> **Different parts of the self are separate selves**

> - We have different bodies

> - I could kill (or slash, burn, force to overdose) her and be unaffected myself
> - Her behavior is not my responsibility

> - The abuse never happened to me

> - They're not my parents

> **The victim is responsible for the abuse**

> - She deserves to be punished for it

> - She deserves to die and I might as well die too

> **It is wrong to show anger (or frustration, defiance, a critical attitude...)**

> - I never feel anger -- she is the angry one

> - She deserves to be punished for allowing the abuse to happen

> - She deserves to be punished for showing anger

> **The past is present**

> - I am 8 years old

> - The abuse is still happening

> - The doctor is going to abuse me now

> - No one will protect me

> **The primary personality can't handle the memories**

> - We have to keep the memories

> - You can't tell her about us

> - If she has to remember, we will make her crazy

> - If she remembers, she won't like us

> - The abuse never happened

> - They must be sick to think that those things happened

> - My parents are not like that

> - She is weak -- I am strong

> **I lowe my parents, but she hates them**

> - She is the bad one

> - You have to get rid of her

> - Nobody could ever be friends with her (or like her)

> - She wants to hurt me

> **The primary personality must be punished**

> - It's her fault the abuse happened

> - She deserves all the bad things that happen to her

> - Everything bad that happens to her happens because she is bad

> - She has suffered enough -- she would be better off if I killed her

> - I can punish her and be unaffected myself

> - I (the punishing alter) was never abused

> **I can't trust myself or others**

> - She trusted before and she got hurt

> - We won't let anyone get close to her

> - I can't trust her -- she gets herself in situations she can't handle

You'll notice that most of those things in bold are things that are reliably found in BPD as well. Someone with DID employs more denial and dissociation to help them support those beliefs, as compared to someone with BPD-only.

I think you'll see by this point that BPD and DID are two slightly different ways of dealing with the same problem. Someone with BPD responds with a wildly overactive self-protective instinct that prompts chaotic behavior in relationships. Someone with DID finds ways to convince themselves that the same incidents didn't happen to them. They happened to that other guy in their head. The rejection happened because the other personality deserved it. If I could only keep that other personality from surfacing, everything would be fine.

**Still, DID is not just a severe form of BPD**

People with DID-only don't have some of the struggles you see in BPD. Someone with DID doesn't have to live with the constant shame and guilt, desperation to change, and feelings of failure. It was some other guy in their head who caused and experienced those things, so there is no need to see it as their fault. That's why DID doesn't have the same cycle of emotional seizures and resulting relationship damage, because the primary personalities of a DID system can disavow being the person who always gets rejected.

It would be possible for someone to have both sets of symptoms at once. This would especially be true in a DID system where the primary personalities do see themselves as incapable of having healthy relationships, which makes them prone to accepting the blame for the cycle of instability that characterizes BPD.

But in practice, a true DID/BPD blend isn't seen all that often because a person tends to prefer one way of managing abandonment over the other. If a person has access to the dissociation that allows the disavowal of responsibility, like you see in DID, they aren't likely to also have the frantic efforts to fix things that you find in BPD. There is no need to frantically struggle to fix relationships if it's really that other guy's fault. The frantic attempts are instead applied to efforts to get rid of that other guy.

Disclaimer: some of my information may be out of date because it has been quite a few years since I was thoroughly familiar with the literature on DID. If anyone has any references that contradict me, please post them. I would love to see what has been discovered since then.

BPD,fj1mnhx,t1_fiyw8uf,1582923253.0,"**What I want to begin with is that of all the disorders that are related to DID, BPD is its closest cousin.**

Note: For those of you who are wondering why I didn't say CPTSD instead, CPTSD is a required co-occurring disorder in DID, not a similar disorder of attachment. CPTSD causes an attachment disorder in a young child when the trauma prevents the child from completing the process of attachment. But CPTSD can also happen to securely attached children, teens, and adults without creating an attachment disorder.

You aren't going to find someone with DID who doesn't meet the BPD criteria because both result from an attachment disorder, both have an 'approach' quality to their attempts to attach, and both have an unusually high usage of unhealthy coping skills. And that is exactly what the DSM 5 criteria for BPD describes.

But a therapist treating someone with DID-but-no-BPD can easily see a difference in day-to-day struggles, compared to BPD-and-healthy-plural-selves. The struggles in DID will revolve around conflicts between personalities and trouble with amnesia, with relationship instability being a result of that chaos.

A person with DID-only is likely to have mostly the same daily struggles regardless of whether they have isolated themselves or whether they are in relationships. Someone with BPD-only will have decreased symptoms while they are isolated, but they will not be able to tolerate isolation for as long as someone with DID-only can.

Here is what Colin Ross, an expert in DID, had to say about the similarity between BPD and DID (emphasis mine):

> The borderline patient switches states. In fact this is the metapsychological hallmark of her disorder. In one state, she disavows her affect and behavior [that happened] while in other states. It is as if she has an amnesia at the level of affect and behavior,  but not at a cognitive or informational level. The borderline patient has a severely impaired continuity of identity across states. If the amnesia barrier was made complete, and the sense of separate identity of the split states elaborated a little, one would be dealing with an alter personality [which would qualify the patient as having DID]. **Phenomenologically, alter personalities are elaborations of borderline splitting.**

> The abused child can use dissociation to block out some or all of the actual abusive events, but this strategy does not solve a more pervasive and inescapable problem: The child is overwhelmed, helpless, and powerless. It is this helplessness and powerlessness that is the deepest trauma. The child's developmental problem is that she must attach to her perpetrator to survive. The little girl is driven by biological imparatives that have been extensively studied in experimental mammals: She must attach to survive biologically, emotionally, and spiritually.

> A survival strategy of extreme detachment would be self-destructive and would cause failure to thrive. Therefore the child tries to attach to her perpetrator father and enabler mother, who is often a perpetrator in her own right. To keep her genetically encoded attachment systems up and running, the child must dissociate. The environment, through the abuse, signals the child to shut down her attachment systems, but her genes override this environmental imperative. The two realities do not fit together, and the world does not make sense.

> To cope with this fundamental threat to its integrity, and to avoid the paralysis of learned helplessness, the organism, whether a little kitten, duckling, monkey, cat, or child, must dissociate. Because of dissociation, the attachment systems can be kept up and running, given that from their point of view the trauma is not occurring. In a human being, the attachment systems become personified as separate identities who idealize the parents, and ar amnesic for most or all of the abuse. The amnesia barriers need not be absolute, as long as they downregulate the traumatic psychophysiology sufficiently to permit attachment.

> In this model, an additional drive to the creation of alter personalities is the need to create stable internal persons who are always available for attachment, safety, security, and nurturing. The need for attachment figures drives the narcissistic investment of the alters in separateness, and the delusion of separate physical bodies they often create. **In the child with lesser dissociative capacity, this strategy results in the creation of polarized but nonpersonified states that alternate in the taking of executive control. This psychological mechanism is called borderline splitting.**

> **It follows from this model that both DID and borderline personality disorder can occur in the absence of overt physical and sexual abuse.** The reason that there are very high rates of reported physical and sexual abuse in DID is that the extreme attachment dilemma required to drive the formation of DID usually occurs in familes that are also overtly and criminally abusive. The overt acts of abuse are traumatic in and of themselves, but are also markers of inevitable severe attachment conflicts in the family's children.

In other words, when you look at someone with BPD-with-healthy-plural selves, the only thing that differentiates them from someone with DID is in the degree to which dissociation has been used to create an artificial separation between personalities and amnesia regarding past experiences.

That is a pretty distinct difference between your parts, and that isn't uncommon for people with plural selves, especially with a trauma background. Happily, you have access to the treatment regardless of diagnosis. For DID, my preference for treatment is IFS along with schema therapy and/or psychodynamic therapy. Which is also a great choice for BPD, even for those who clearly don't have plural selves, because people with BPD still have the same challenges with their protective instinct causing the crises we have already discussed.

I will write more about the line between having a distinct difference within plural selves versus DID, but I want to include information from a book that I don't have with me right now. To be continued..."
BPD,fiyckxv,t1_fiy76to,1582836812.0,"Also, your boyfriend needs to go fly a kite with his idea that his childhood was worse than yours, so you should be as 'fine' as he is.

Researchers have been saying for a long time that it isn't only the level of trauma that leads to ongoing symptoms; it's aggravated by any lack of emotional support in the aftermath. Trauma forces us to re-evaluate our world and try to fit this experience into it in a way that makes sense. If the trauma happens in an environment where there it feels like no one cares about the pain you are in, that is going to cause more scarring than the same trauma would cause in an environment where, say, the siblings can look at each other and say, ""That sucked.""

(Edited to add this paragraph)
Also, when abuse is blatant, it is much easier to recognize that your reactions are valid. Of course, you are going to be scared and hurt after someone has lost their temper on you. It is harder to accept your feelings as valid when you aren't quite sure whether you were to blame for that rejection you just experienced.

BPD by its nature is isolating. You have never had the feeling that anyone truly had your back. Even when people are positive toward you, you can't trust it because it never stays that way. They always reject you or unfairly punish you or invalidate your experience.

Speaking of invalidating your experience, your boyfriend needs to knock off that behavior or he will be reinforcing your BPD symptoms and make it that much harder to get better.

BPD has its origins in infancy. You can look at the behaviors of the mothers with their infants and you can predict attachment problems by looking at whether the mother is responsive when their child is upset and whether the mother is good at re-establishing a sense of safety when their child is scared. A mother might be bad at doing those things without anyone ever noticing that there is a problem. We don't think of it as abusive if a mother is a little inattentive or distracted, and it's not. But it is traumatic to that infant who has no control over their world and no one else to turn to.

Your BPD would have been developing since before you had the ability to properly form memories.

BPD also features a history of people running hot and cold. Sometimes people are wonderful and supportive, but eventually something happens and you're back to the same old rejection, punishment, and/or invalidation. After a while, the kid is smart enough to catch that this is a pattern that always happens. The positive attention feels traumatizing on its own because the kid interprets it as the bait in a bait-and-switch scenario.

BPD isn't about whether you have had shocking, terrifying incidents of abuse. It is about a world that has always felt quietly hostile to who you are as a person. It's easy to imagine someone who has suffered many instances of blatant abuse but who doesn't have an overall feeling that the world is quietly hostile to them in particular.

> But I’m like really mental and apparently am really cruel and act “psychotic” half the time.

See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bpd/comments/fa29m3/_/fiy5rlc) about what is actually behind all of that cruelty and ""psychotic"" behavior."
BPD,fiyc6pr,t1_fiy8of2,1582836603.0,"You're welcome! I'm so glad that I could help!

Dissociation happens along a continuum, as does the experience of having one distinct self versus having many distinct selves. Humans are naturally plural in their personality when they are small children. Over time, the child develops their feeling of who they are in the world. Children in healthy environments tend to experience a solidifying into one distinct personality, but they will still grow up to have different parts, like 'mom mode,' 'work mode,' and 'romantic mode.'

Children in unhealthy environments may or may not find that it is useful to retain that sense of different selves, especially if they have learned that they can get more validation if they change between selves to match the person or situation they are dealing with. It is also possible for a child raised in a healthy environment to decide not to solidify into one distinct personality.

The line between a healthy plurality of selves and DID is in the lines that are drawn between personalities. In DID, there are different rules about what each personality are allowed be aware of or what viewpoints they are allowed to hold. Instead of just having different aspects of yourself, the child felt the need to selectively remove access to certain skills and abilities so that the personalities feel like they really are separate people with separate gifts. That strict separation makes it possible for them to feel like the rejection of one personality isn't a rejection of all of them. Those personalities engage in in-fighting like you have with your BPD, where personalities attack and sabotage each other.

This takeover is a normal thing for someone who has a history of childhood trauma, such as you find in BPD. It isn't a bad thing unless it is causing distress or problems. Unless it has the sharp divisions like you see in DID, it is almost always a healthy, adaptive thing and it can be a useful tool in your recovery.

As for her taking over your behavior, it is likely that it's just a separate self who is more vulnerable to being controlled by the pressures your BPD puts on you. If you have the ability to switch between selves, it only makes sense that she would prefer to use her tricks on a self who is more vulnerable to them."
BPD,fiy76to,t3_fafmmx,1582833869.0,"It's tricky because it takes some digging to really understand the definition of trauma.

We usually think of trauma as any shocking incident that makes the world seem unsafe and rocks our sense of what the world is like. That's a good starting point. But it can be really subtle, especially when that shock is a matter of a child not getting the emotional support that they absolutely need in order to develop a healthy sense of self.

BPD happens when a child cannot develop trust in the feeling that their caregivers will forgive them and love them no matter what they do. This failure doesn't require blatant abuse. It could simply be that a parent is easily distracted by siblings or other worries and routinely doesn't notice that their child is reaching out for their support.

This usually also includes experiences of being punished for things that the child couldn't have anticipated or prevented, often resulting from impulsivity that a child of that age cannot control. But the punishment might have been moderate and it may be that it would have been perfectly reasonable for an older child, who had more self-control. The parents believe that the punishment is justified, so they teach their child that the punishment was deserved and that the child should feel guilt or shame about the incident. The child is convinced that they deserved it, leaving the child with a sense that they deserve punishment even when they don't know any better or when they can't resist the impulsive action that they took.

Looking back, that person may not see any signs that their home environment was harmful. Their siblings may have had a supportive upbringing. Their parents may have never noticed that the child was upset or troubled, or they had some other explanation that allowed them to see that distress as minor and unimportant. No one recognizes that the punishments were too harsh for a child of a given age range because they may not remember what age they were when it happened, or they may think it's normal discipline for a child that young. A skilled observer probably could have spotted the fact that the child was unduly, inconsolably distressed, but that family may not have noticed it at the time.

This repeated failure to re-connect and re-establish safety still qualifies as trauma because that child has experienced emotional neglect. The child had needs that weren't met. They had no other way to get those needs met. The child was left without the emotional support that is required to develop a sense of safety in the world.

As the child becomes an adult, they probably don't even see it as neglect because that is their normal. BPD tells you that it's your fault that people reject you. It can be impossible to spot the rejections that shouldn't have happened when you have become convinced that those rejections were normal and reasonable."
BPD,fiy6nmc,t3_fagirz,1582833567.0,"The most common form of maladaptive dissociation causes a sense of complete detachment where you feel like nothing in the world is real or like you aren't real. 

Dissociation is common in people who have a history of trauma. It can also be drug induced. (The last paragraph quoted below gives more information on drugs that cause dissociation.)

From Wiki: (forgive me if you have already read it!)

> Dissociation is any of a wide array of experiences from mild detachment from immediate surroundings to more severe detachment from physical and emotional experiences. The major characteristic of all dissociative phenomena involves a detachment from reality, rather than a loss of reality as in psychosis.

> Dissociation is commonly displayed on a continuum. In mild cases, dissociation can be regarded as a coping mechanism or defense mechanisms in seeking to master, minimize or tolerate stress – including boredom or conflict. At the non-pathological end of the continuum, dissociation describes common events such as daydreaming. Further along the continuum are non-pathological altered states of consciousness.

> More pathological dissociation involves dissociative disorders, including dissociative fugue and depersonalization disorder with or without alterations in personal identity or sense of self. These alterations can include: a sense that self or the world is unreal (depersonalization and derealization); a loss of memory (amnesia)...

> Psychoactive drugs can often induce a state of temporary dissociation. Substances with dissociative properties include ketamine, nitrous oxide, alcohol, tiletamine, amphetamine, dextromethorphan, MK-801, PCP, methoxetamine, salvia, muscimol, atropine, ibogaine, and minocycline."
BPD,fiy5rlc,t3_fa29m3,1582833068.0,"Your BPD self is acting purely out of self protection. But she has limitations in what she understands. She's not a separate personality with her own thoughts and feelings, like you find in DID. Still, I find it very useful to think of that aspect of BPD as a separate part that you need to work with.

She is really just your self-protective instinct. Instincts are amazing and valuable but they are also kind of dumb (inflexible and unaware) compared to you. Her entire world is wrapped up in simple ideas like 'if it hurts, make it stop' and 'if there is danger, pay attention and be able to react immediately and decisively.'

She has a very different viewpoint on what safety is and how to get it. She doesn't really understand that tomorrow exists. She can't see cause and effect like you can. All she knows is, all your fancy pants rationalizations and seeing into the future isn't fixing this, so it is her job to do what you can't.

She knows from long experience that when you think you have found safety and love you are rewarded with rejection or unfair punishment. That is something that has happened again and again. In her mind, you are foolish for refusing to accept that that is how the world works. She keeps watching you run into burning buildings and somehow you don't seem to expect that you will get burned.

She can't stop you from interacting with people. She can't keep you from getting into relationships. All she can do is throw emotions, memories, and fears at you until you are too destroyed to resist what she wants you to do. She wants you to fight everything that feels hurtful, unfair, or threatening. She doesn't see any problem with doing that as brutally as possible because she doesn't have any concept of tomorrow. Now is forever, to her.

If you feel hurt or attacked by him, the only thing that matters to her is making it stop, so she believes it is fair game if you are as aggressive and cruel as possible to him. If you feel abandoned, she will push you to use clinging, jealous accusations, and anything else she can think of so that he will come back and show devotion. She doesn't care about the consequences you will suffer tomorrow because she is rooted completely in the present.

You know there will be horrible consequences. You know that those actions will backfire. And you know that it isn't actually necessary to battle everything as harshly and as quickly as possible. To you, she is overreacting and sabotaging things. You try as hard as you can to ignore her and do what you know is right.

She sees you ignoring her and becomes terrified at her lack of control. She has to get you to listen. She has to get you to defend yourself. She needs you to do something to make things okay. All she can do is escalate the distress you feel.

She pulls up old memories of past failures to convince you that your judgment can't be trusted. She shows you memories of the most devastating moments you have ever survived so that you will be overwhelmed with emotion and unable to think clearly. She finds the most upsetting meanings she can find for his behavior. She takes any new information and bends it into a weapon. She does everything she can to convince you that she is right, so he must not deserve any mercy. She wears down your strength, overwhelms your reason, and provokes your impulsivity until you feel like you have no choice but to do what she is telling you to do.

You lash out. The argument with him escalates and turns into a battle that you must win at all costs. Horrible things are said. You bring up things that you know will hurt him. You are now using the same tactics against him that she uses against you.

After the argument ends and you are alone, she realizes that the threat is no longer there. Then she finally realizes that there are going to be consequences for what you said and did. She starts catastrophizing. She comes up with the worst predictions she can find for what is going to happen next. To her, she is just trying to prepare you so that you can act quickly and decisively. She doesn't want you to be blindsided. She has no idea that this whole process is so self-destructive that it causes a lot more problems than it prevents.

While she drags you through all the worst case scenarios and makes you rehearse what should do in each situation, you are busy suffering endless shame and regret for losing control again. You want to fix it, but long experience tells you that any attempts at fixing it are more likely to make things even worse. You feel hopeless, worthless, and deeply self-destructive.

She eventually finishes with the catastrophizing and she picks up on your wishes to fix it. She pressures you to act. She thinks you should do something, anything, to keep the consequences you keep thinking of and the worst case scenarios she came up with from happening. She wants you to contact him and do anything you can to make sure he's happy with you. That is the most important thing in the world, and she doesn't care if that means interfering with his sleep or his work or his time with other people. She needs you to fix it now, before the consequences set in.

In the process of trying to get you to act, she makes sure you are as guilt-stricken and horrified at your actions as you can possibly be. She doesn't really understand enough of cause-and-effect to grasp how it happened, but she sees that you are desperate to make this cycle stop so that you won't make those same mistake again and again. You knew better before this happened and you did it again, so maybe the only way to make you really learn is to torture you with it until you are terrified of doing it. But that doesn't make you able to actually avoid that mistake. It just makes you terrified of making any mistakes. If every possible mistake is marked with a red flag, it is easy to miss the red flag on things that damage your relationship.

It's back and forth between you two. You try to ignore her. She escalates until you can't resist. You act out again. She catastrophizes again...

She really is trying everything she can to protect you, even when you fight her every step of the way. She doesn't understand that her impulsive, now-is-forever approach is what is causing the problem. She isn't really a person with the ability to think things through. She's just an instinct that reacts to whatever is currently happening.

**How do you fix it?**

1) DBT coping skills will make it harder for her to escalate things. You will have more ability to keep things inside the way someone with quiet BPD does. It won't stop you from experiencing it all exactly the same way, but you will be more able to hide it from him.

2) You and your boyfriend need to learn not to interact with each other when you are upset. It is healthy to tell him that you need to put everything on hold. My husband and I think of it as pausing the movie. It doesn't change what is going on. Everyone is still struggling with their emotions. You will both have to press play eventually. But that can wait until the emotions calm down so that she has to start from the beginning if she hopes to escalate until you are too overwhelmed to resist her.

Sometimes you have to pause the movie repeatedly. It is okay to do it as much as you need to, as long as you two are always willing to come back to it later. You have to promise each other that it will be addressed next time things are calm and there is time to discuss it. If instead, you pause it but you don't come back to it, she will start escalating every time you pause, just to force you to deal with it now.

3) In therapy, you need to eventually work on finding a truce with her. Her fear is that you aren't listening. Right now, the only way you can prove that you are listening is by doing what she wants you to do. If you learn instead to listen and validate her, she won't need you to prove that you heard her, so she won't need to escalate to force you to act. The best way I know of to get to that point is through [Internal Family Systems therapy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/internal-family-systems-therapy)."
BPD,fiwgkxh,t1_fiw7bzz,1582785128.0,"That's only natural. You want to divide and conquer. You still see something worth saving in your relationship, and if you can just start addressing the individual problems, you'll be able to finally start seeing some improvement.

I really do hope that it doesn't turn out to be BPD with him. It's an extremely difficult disorder for a person to live with. An article on Psychology Today says, ""Almost 80 percent of those with BPD report a history of suicide attempts, and suicide deaths range between 8-10 percent. This rate is 50 times greater than that found in the general population, according to a 2014 analysis of BPD research by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).""

There are some mental disorders that do respond to more of a divide and conquer approach. ADHD is one example, where the two of you would be able to work together to recognize the difference between problems that can be resolved and problems that simply have to be accepted as a difficulty you both need to work around. You could then work together to find new systems for preventing consequences and new ways of communication to improve the handling of both.

BPD isn't a disorder that responds to a divide and conquer approach. For someone who is unfamiliar with BPD, it is easy to identify behaviors and beliefs that seem unrealistic or a matter of overreaction. From the perspective of someone without BPD, it seems clear that you could problem solve those situations, figuring out where the confusion was, and thereby keep it from happening again. But it just doesn't work in BPD.

This leads people to decide that the person with BPD doesn't care or isn't trying or is unwilling to see reason. Any hurtful behaviors seem intentional and cruel when the person with BPD keeps doing them even though you know they know better.

What outsiders miss is that BPD is very similar in some ways to how media has portrayed PTSD. If a person with BPD is acting out, it is likely that they are in the midst of an emotional seizure, where everything is so intense and overwhelming that it is initially impossible to resist every impulse, whether that is to lash out in anger or to beg their person to stay up all night with them.

The media likes to portray PTSD flashbacks the same way, where the person is supposedly lashing out violently because they aren't aware of reality for the moment. (That is not a fair depiction of PTSD. That's what media has shown, though.)

After the episode of acting out, the person with BPD is fully aware that they made things even worse than they were. This can lead to more emotional seizures and erratic, damaging behavior, or it can result in deep spirals of shame and helplessness, like media might show for a soldier with survivor's guilt.

Meanwhile, onlookers don't understand why it doesn't help to point out the behaviors and expect the behaviors to change. They don't change from a round of introspection and resolve because the behaviors don't happen when the person has full control over their impulses.

Media likes to show PTSD as being triggered by every loud sound or quick movement. BPD can jump into an emotional seizure with any slight sign or even imagined sign of trouble in a relationship. The partner's well-intentioned attempt to discuss and resolve a problem can be that sign of trouble. It does feel like there's no way to win, at first.

I'm describing what BPD looks like to be an observer. I know by now that the interior world of someone with BPD is a constant, desperate attempt to get enough control to at least keep others from seeing the hell they are going through.

Now, the wonderful thing is that BPD is very treatable. People learn new ways to cope with the emotional seizures and even to get them to be much, much rarer. There is nothing hopeless about BPD, even though it starts out every bit as hellish as schizophrenia seems to be. Still, that improvement is going to be 90% from work that the person with BPD does privately, working with their treatment team.

And what outsiders don't know is, every single moment, the reactions of someone with BPD are utterly, completely understandable, if only you could sit in their head and experience their memories and feel the emotions they feel. This is not a moral failure at all. It is not a matter of being truly blind or being uncaring. This is someone trapped in an impossible situation, and somehow, miraculously, treatment has finally evolved that eventually eases that hell.

The remaining 10% that the partner can help with is in working on boundaries, transparency, and communication. The world of someone with BPD is a living nightmare where nothing is as it seems. When a partner is consistent in being honest even when it hurts and in maintaining healthy boundaries, they create a place where the person with BPD can eventually learn to find peace in.

And the simplest, best advice I have for any partner of someone with BPD is, never hesitate to go to bed mad.

You eventually learn, as a partner in a healthy relationship with someone with BPD, that often you need to just drop it and come back to it later, even if that means pausing and picking something back up five times. You will never accomplish any effective communication while the person with BPD is in a state of high distress."
BPD,fiw6fh5,t3_fa2w52,1582776345.0,"My husband has BPD. Before that, I was with someone with dependent personality disorder and CPTSD. Before that, I was married to someone with bipolar. I have spent almost twenty years of my life supporting people with serious mental illnesses and helping as much as I could to wrangle symptoms.

Nothing you said in your post gave enough information to suggest that BPD is any more likely than bipolar, ADHD, NPD, substance abuse, or plain old lack of care and consideration for you.

Fortunately, that doesn't matter. You aren't going to get him any closer to accepting treatment by trying to diagnose him. It doesn't matter at this point which mental disorder he has, or if he even has a mental disorder at all. What matters is that you two are experiencing serious stress and communication problems in your relationship. He is not acting in ways that suggest that he currently cares about your feelings.

In my experience, there are only two avenues that are likely to bring you success at this point, since he apparently isn't expressing any distress about his own mental health. One is, of course, couples counseling.

Second, Al-Anon is a great resource for anyone who is in a caregiver role with someone. Most people start going to Al-Anon because they want to learn how to get their loved one to stop drinking. The entire purpose of Al-Anon is to help partners and family members who are helpless to fix the destructive behaviors that are damaging their relationship.

It is designed for family and friends of alcoholics. But really is applicable to anyone in a caregiver role, especially if they are struggling with questions of how to get that person to accept help. They help you sort out your own boundaries and protect yourself from the instability in your relationship. It makes you stronger so that you aren't acting from a point of desperation, but rather, from a point of self-protection.

They can offer so much more support for questions of how to get someone to accept treatment than you will find in a forum for sufferers of a particular disorder because that is what they do day in and day out.

They welcome anyone who has anyone in their family with an alcohol or susbstance use problem. It's rare to find someone who doesn't have something like that somewhere in their family tree.

There is no need for the alcohol/substance use issues to be present in the current problem relationship because they see current struggles as a repeated pattern that is originally learned while a family struggles to manage life with an untreated alcoholic/substance abuser. Your husband may not abuse substances, but that doesn't mean that your responses wouldn't be repeating patterns you experienced during your upbringing or a previous adult relationship.

They follow the twelve steps format of AA, but there isn't any need to actually work the steps, see yourself as powerless, or worship any higher power other than your own sense of what is best for you. Where you get the help is by sitting in meetings, hearing others' experiences, and having your own chance to share your experiences.

Last note, don't come to a decision based on one try. Every different day of the week has a different blend of people who create a different atmosphere. Try several different time slots and/or locations to see if one fits with your personality.

I hope some of this helps. I know you are in such a tough position right now. There is help out there, and if he won't accept it, you can accept the kinds of help that are available for caregiving partners.

Edit: Took out the recommendation for couples counseling since it looks like you're already doing that."
BPD,fisfa5v,t3_f9h9bp,1582683740.0,"**""I am manipulative and fake.""**

People call it manipulation. I call it desperation crossed with a lot more social competence than you give yourself credit for. Sure, it is ultimately manipulative. It is also manipulative for a babysitter to feign interest in a child's artwork. It is manipulative to hide your anger at being pulled over and given a traffic ticket you didn't deserve. Social interaction requires discretion. A person who is good at socializing knows when to hide the truth to manage others' feelings.

I hear you saying, ""A person who is good at socializing knows when to keep their mouths shut, too."" Well, you don't accurately remember it, but you were playing to the mood that was happening at that moment. Just like showing excitement to the child who is proud of their distorted stick figures, you were matching and encouraging the feel that was in the air.

No, you didn't exercise as much forethought as other people might. Your BPD was pushing you to be as charming as possible so that people won't reject you. Your emotional need in that moment was to show yourself as being part of the team. If you were surrounded by people who felt critical but couldn't quite bring themselves to say it, you would have felt the urge to say it for them so that you could display that you agreed with them.

Looking back, all you really remember is the words and snapshot images. You forget the tiny little changes in each person's facial expression, tone of voice, and gestures. If you were the one in the room who said the most words about what you were all feeling, you will remember it as if you were the only one who was critical. Thing is, you never would have expressed that criticism if you hadn't sensed that the criticism was welcomed by everyone present.

**Handling the guilt and shame that you feel right now**

After the fact, damage control kicks in and second guesses everything. It realizes that that's something that may come back to bite you. You have plenty of experiences of people punishing you when you didn't deserve it. That leads to feeling absolutely certain that you will be punished because this time, it is true that you did something that may be hurtful. So did the others in the room. Does the shared guilt protect you from being singled out for punishment? Of course not. It is realistic to worry that you might end up with consequences.

But when it comes to your own sense of guilt or shame, take some time to question whether you feel that the others in the room deserve the same. If you do, that is fair. We all do things we regret sometimes. If not, question why. Because you wouldn't have said it if you hadn't sensed that everyone there welcomed it.

That doesn't take the guilt and shame away, I know. As always, you are going to be stuck suffering through it until some other emotional crisis takes its place.

**But don't I deserve to suffer as much as I can possibly suffer for what I have done? If I don't, how will I ever learn my lesson?**

Whether you deserved the guilt or shame or not, BPD is going to cause your survival instinct to torture you with it because BPD desperately wants you to learn your lesson so that you never end up in this position again. Torturing people for their mistakes doesn't make them better at avoiding mistakes. It makes them more terrified of mistakes, so they hyperfocus on assessing every risk instead of focusing on what feels emotionally true.

If you feel that it is true for you that your behavior was unacceptable, a moderate amount of guilt will press you to be anxious whenever you sense that you are in a similar situation. But if you are too focused on avoiding every mistake you could possibly make in every situation (which is standard in BPD), there is no way for your emotions to tell you that this situation is riskier than other situations. You can't mentally put a red flag on this type of situation if you have red flags on every situation.

**What can I do to prevent this kind of thing from happening again?**

The biggest thing you can do to prevent this sort of thing from happening again is to keep an eye out for an extra twinge of trepidation. It feels kind of like the spark of anxiety when you're thinking of turning onto a busy road, where you aren't sure that there's enough room for you to sneak into the flow of traffic without getting hit.

Eventually, treatment will make it so that you don't need to have quite so many red flags about every tiny little mistake you could possibly make. That will make it much easier to spot the things that are really important to watch out for.

**I always relive my mistakes over and over again, no matter how long it has been since the mistake happened**

Your BPD will torture you about this for a while in hopes that you will learn your lesson. But eventually another situation that sparks huge emotions will take center stage.

Some day in the future, BPD will make you relive this situation all over again, even though it was a long time ago and you hoped you were finally over it. That isn't a sign that you aren't really over it. It's just something that BPD does.

When you have BPD, your survival instinct is working furiously to warn you about risks. It is also pushing you into taking immediate action to soothe whatever feelings you are feeling. You know by now what it's like to have an emotional seizure where you can't help but do things you are going to regret later. By now, you have probably also had times where you felt that need to act and you were able to keep yourself from acting.

When your survival instinct is pushing you to act out and you are successfully resisting, your survival instinct interprets that as you ignoring its warnings. It isn't trying to get you to act out in order to relieve your distress. It is trying to get you to act out because it truly believes that its plans for acting out are going to protect you.

To get you to listen, it gets louder and more hateful. It will say, remember that time when you just had to open your mouth and criticize your co-workers? Naturally, you will feel this guilt and shame all over again. That makes your emotional distress even bigger than it was before. Your survival instinct is escalating the situation in hopes of making your distress so huge that your healthy coping skills don't work. With your coping skills defeated, you end up acting out. The survival instinct finally stops escalating because it feels like you are finally listening to what it is saying and you have done what it believes you need to do.

When this guilt and shame comes back to haunt you, take a moment to check whether some current, unrelated incident has sparked another round of trying to resist acting out when you know that will cause more pain in the end. If that is what is happening, breathe and try to recognize that you're not remembering this incident because you deserve to relive it. You are reliving the incident because your survival instinct is busy escalating things in hopes that you will act out in a way that it thinks will protect you."
BorderlinePDisorder,firi0cn,t1_fir9x6i,1582664773.0,"I find it really frustrating that the profession lets people assume that every therapist is equivalent to the next therapist. People try one or two therapists, get no help from them, and give up.

Research reliably shows that the most important thing in therapy is the rapport between the patient and client. It usually takes several tries before you find someone who seems knowledgeable, interested, engaged, and supportive. I've heard it takes 5-7 tries on average, though I don't know where I heard that.

Secondly, there are a lot of therapies out there that are very different from each other. Wikipedia lists over 150 distinct therapies. DBT, for example, is the one that everyone talks about for BPD. DBT is excellent for teaching coping skills and self-awareness. If your family and friends are expressing a lot of distress about your behavior, DBT is the way to go. But it doesn't treat the actual cause of the distress. In my opinion, it turns the average case of BPD into a case of discouraged BPD (quiet BPD). (The untreated person with discouraged BPD won't have nearly as many coping skills, though.)

The cause of the distress is the long history of abandonment, betrayal, rejection, and/or unjust punishment. DBT doesn't work to resolve those kinds of issues. It just gives you a better way of tolerating them. There are other therapies that work directly on the inner experience of terror and loss.

This difference between therapies wouldn't really matter to the patient if every therapist was familiar with all the available therapies and could make sure that they are using a therapy that matches with your current struggles. In my experience, any given therapist is familiar with about 5-10 different therapies and they strongly prefer to stick with the two or three that their mentor in graduate school favored.

That leaves it up to the patient to make sure that their therapist is capable of doing a type of therapy that targets your current issues.

Fortunately, there are several different therapies that can address any given problem. For example, ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy) can do a lot of the things DBT can do. Most of the therapies that specifically target trauma are able to dig into the hell that you go through internally. So you don't really need to learn all the differences between all the different therapies.

If others are upset with your behavior, DBT is the gold standard. For the inner problems, you will be pretty safe going with any therapist who specializes in treating trauma. After you narrowed it down to someone who can do what you need, you would then have to try several of them until you find someone you have good rapport with.

Whether or not you decide to give therapy another chance, I wish you the best."
BorderlinePDisorder,fir81hj,t3_f9efh8,1582659211.0,"With BPD, there is an inner struggle between you (the person who is doing everything they can to be rational and functional) and your protective instinct (everything in you that reacts violently to possible problems in relationships). You are trying with all your might to ignore and avoid acting on all of the huge, seemingly unreasonable urges and fears that your protective instinct throws at you. It responds by finding bigger and better ways to get your attention, usually by tearing you to shreds so that you don't have the strength to keep fighting against it.

This feeling that people are against you, that's your protective instinct trying every trick it can find to get you to stop putting yourself in harm's way by interacting with people. What makes it different from actual paranoia like you would see in a psychotic disorder is that you have the awareness that there isn't enough evidence yet to say for sure that it is true. It feels true. Your protective instinct overwhelms you with emotions that match the claims it is making. It makes good arguments for its claims by showing you every iffy interaction it can remember. It insults you and tortures you in hopes of making you doubt yourself so that you will trust it more than you trust yourself.

This barrage from your protective instinct is its response to your attempts to ignore it and avoid acting on its claims. But you can't just give in. That leads to more acting out and more self-destructive behavior. You fight against it for a very important and good reason. So what can you do?

Ultimately, the problem is that your protective instinct feels like you aren't listening to the things it tries to tell you. It gets louder and louder to try to force you to listen. Therapies like Internal Family Systems therapy help you to develop a truce and eventually learn to validate your protective instinct's claims without having to prove yourself by acting on them."
BorderlinePDisorder,fiqwceb,t1_fiqbzdo,1582652829.0,"Sounds like it is a misdiagnosis. BPD requires an experience of repeated abandonment, rejection, betrayal, invalidation, and/or unjust punishment. That is what causes all the symptoms, which are frantic, desperate attempts to finally, for once, have a safe and trustworthy relationship. But signs of success are understandably distrusted because over and over, they get into a relationship that finally feels safe and trustworthy and then it ends in more betrayal or rejection. They are torn between (1) an undeniable, normal human need for love and security and (2) terror of things going wrong again because they have barely survived so far and they don't know how much more they can take before the constant lure of suicide overwhelms their will to live.

Dissociation is common in people who have a history of trauma. It can also be drug induced. (The last paragraph quoted below gives more information on drugs that cause dissociation.)

From Wiki:

> Dissociation is any of a wide array of experiences from mild detachment from immediate surroundings to more severe detachment from physical and emotional experiences. The major characteristic of all dissociative phenomena involves a detachment from reality, rather than a loss of reality as in psychosis.

> Dissociation is commonly displayed on a continuum. In mild cases, dissociation can be regarded as a coping mechanism or defense mechanisms in seeking to master, minimize or tolerate stress – including boredom or conflict. At the non-pathological end of the continuum, dissociation describes common events such as daydreaming. Further along the continuum are non-pathological altered states of consciousness.

> More pathological dissociation involves dissociative disorders, including dissociative fugue and depersonalization disorder with or without alterations in personal identity or sense of self. These alterations can include: a sense that self or the world is unreal (depersonalization and derealization); a loss of memory (amnesia)...

> Psychoactive drugs can often induce a state of temporary dissociation. Substances with dissociative properties include ketamine, nitrous oxide, alcohol, tiletamine, amphetamine, dextromethorphan, MK-801, PCP, methoxetamine, salvia, muscimol, atropine, ibogaine, and minocycline."

Quoting Philip Manfield, here:

> The term personality disorder, also called a disorder of the self, refers to a lack of a genuine sense of ""self"" and a consequent impairment of self-regulating abilities. Instead of looking within themselves to locate feeling or make decisions, patients with personality disorders look outside themselves for evaluations, directions, rules, or opinions to guide them.

> Polyvagal theory helps us understand that both branches of the vagus nerve calm the body, but they do so in different ways. Shutdown, or freeze-or-faint, occurs through the dorsal branch of the vagus nerve. This reaction can feel like the fatigued muscles and lightheadedness of a bad flu. **When the dorsal vagal nerve shuts down the body, it can move us into immobility or dissociation.** In addition to affecting the heart and lungs, the dorsal branch affects body functioning below the diaphragm and is involved in digestive issues.

> The ventral branch of the vagal nerve affects body functioning above the diaphragm. **This is the branch that serves the social engagement system. The ventral vagal nerve dampens the body’s regularly active state.** Picture controlling a horse as you ride it back to the stable. You would continue to pull back on and release the reins in nuanced ways to ensure that the horse maintains an appropriate speed. Likewise, the ventral vagal nerve allows activation in a nuanced way, thus offering a different quality than sympathetic activation.

> The body-awareness techniques that are part of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) can help clients move out of dissociative, shutdown responses by encouraging them to become more embodied. When clients are more present in their bodies and better able to attend to momentary muscular tension, they can wake up from a shutdown response. As clients activate out of shutdown and shift toward fight-or-flight sensations, the thought-restructuring techniques that are also part of CBT and DBT can teach clients to evaluate their safety more accurately. Reflective listening techniques can help clients feel a connection with their counselors. This makes it possible for these clients to feel safe enough to shift into social engagement biology.

BorderlinePDisorder,fipnune,t1_fiph74t,1582613324.0,"I absolutely agree with you. I'm prone to dissociation so I suspect it's the only way for me to emotionally recall a situation that seems long ago and far away.

Also, a child who blames himself for the bad things that happen to him gets to hold on to a sense that he has some control over the situation. Emotionally, at this point, I mostly feel intense relief because I am convinced that I have found the key to making sure it never happens to me again. But when I squint I can see the faintest hints of fear and dread behind that.

Step 10) Second guess EVERYTHING

It is common for people with BPD to be good at reading social situations because your emotional survival is so reliant on picking up subtle cues and using that to avoid the mistakes that you somehow can never be forgiven for making.

Your re-imagining of the situation is going to focus on your own actions and feelings. You might be able to re-imagine her gestures and her words, but your recall will not include the subtle signs you read from her face, her movements, and her manner of speech.

You are going to feel incapable and powerless if you're imagining an interaction in the past or in the future because you don't realize how dependent you are on reading the social situation in the moment.

Because you read cues in the moment, you're actually much better at social interaction than you think you are. While you are in the room with her, you have the extra information you need. You automatically take on mannerisms that she will be receptive to. You have an instinctive feel for whether she is being honest and genuine.

When you re-imagine the situation that happened, you stress because you don't have all the information you need. Your predictions of future interactions don't contain that extra information. You imagine them while feeling the terror that belongs to being unable to read the situation.

Even if your interaction with her goes exactly as you feared it would, it will still feel a million times safer and more manageable because you will be able to read all of the little details that tell you exactly where she is on the situation, whether she is being honest with you, and what she feels toward you now."
BorderlinePDisorder,fip4u9t,t3_f90cih,1582598056.0,"Diagnosable mental disorder or not, we partners fail at maintaining healthy boundaries. It's practically guaranteed that we partners have poor boundaries and/or attachment issues. Securely attached people with healthy boundaries are going to nope their way out of the relationship at the first sign of clinginess.

Those of us who don't have BPD have a horrible tendency to withhold the truth about our own needs out of some belief that it will protect your feelings or reduce conflict or whatever. That is, assuming that we're even aware of our needs in the first place. If we aren't aware of our own needs, it is all too easy to sacrifice because we don't know that there is a cost to ourselves.

This is especially true for people who have assigned themselves the role of 'helper' to someone with BPD. And those helpers are usually absolutely horrible at maintaining their own boundaries. They are part of the problem.

You have the right to know the truth, even though it's hard to hear it. You have the right to know where the lines are.

We partners are responsible for knowing what we can do without risking our own welfare. We are responsible for saying no before we push ourselves too far. We have the ability to say no. **And if we don't, we're the biggest part of the problem because someone with BPD has absolutely no chance of having a good relationship with someone who plays hide-and-seek with the rules.**

I have been in an abusive relationship with someone who didn't have BPD. (It was probably dependent personality disorder.) By the end of it, he had escalated his behavior to emotional abuse. I had to leave the relationship and never look back.

But I recognize that I made choices prior to the onset of abuse that led to its ugly conclusion. I put myself in the place of 'helper' and let him lean on me again and again until I was absolutely drained. I thought it was the least I could do. I loved him and I didn't want to see him suffer. I thought it was a tiny sacrifice on my part that made a big difference in his life.

But no matter how much I let him lean, I couldn't give him a permanent sense of safety. He would inevitably come to the next crisis that the current level of support couldn't soothe. I had to offer more and more support to give that sense of safety back to him.

It was at the end, when he was more dependent than he had ever been, that he started abusing me for being unable to meet his needs. His loving behavior wasn't getting him additional support, and neither were the things that prompted pity and caregiving. He became angry and resentful. When I tried to take time for myself, he punished me by withholding love and behaving coldly toward me. Things continued to escalate into other methods of emotional abuse.

I had effectively decided that I wouldn't deny him anything as long he didn't abuse me. That made it impossible for me to see any warning signs that would have allowed me to leave before the abuse started.

To be clear, the escalation to abuse was entirely his fault. He should have had some line inside himself that said that it wasn't okay to hurt me in order to gain more support. But it would be unfair of me to say that my poor boundaries didn't make that chain of events possible.

If I had maintained healthy boundaries from the beginning, he would have been forced to cope with his own feelings. By taking charge of soothing his feelings, I robbed him of opportunities to develop better coping skills. He wouldn't have been in a pattern of pressing me to continually increase my support if I had had a firm boundary on how much support I was willing to give.

That relationship taught me what I needed to know to have a very healthy relationship with the man I married who has BPD. We've been together five years. From day one, I've made sure he knew exactly what was okay and what wasn't. BPD doesn't like to hear that, but I trusted him to tolerate it anyway. And he did. He always has.

We both check each other when he starts relying on me too much. Fortunately, it makes him anxious to rely on me, so he usually retreats before I even see there's a problem."
Borderline,fioolc2,t1_fiomkma,1582587395.0,"Here is the more complicated explanation about how ""Borderline"" originally meant being on the border between neurosis and psychosis, and how that leads to good self-awareness compared to others with similar disorders.

**Let's get a feel for what professionals were getting at when they thought of BPD as on the border between neurosis and psychosis**

Quoting Philip Manfield, here:

> A neurotic patient is preoccupied with conflict: ""Why do I do what I do? What is driving me?"" He struggles with guilt: guilt for committing forbidden acts, for entertaining forbidden thoughts, for surviving where others did not, and for experiencing forbidden pleasure. Generally, the neurotic patient's problem is finding release from a harsh, judgmental, controlling, internal observer.

> In contrast to the neurotic patient with typically overdeveloped and restrictive values and standards that constrain him, there is the patient with a [Borderline, Narcissistic, Schizoid, or Antisocial] personality disorder whose values and standards have been borrowed from parents and others. The term personality disorder, also called a disorder of the self, refers to a lack of a genuine sense of ""self"" and a consequent impairment of self-regulating abilities. Instead of looking within themselves to locate feeling or make decisions, patients with personality disorders look outside themselves for evaluations, directions, rules, or opinions to guide them. While a neurotic patient is struggling with feeling repressed and overcontrolled, the patient with a personality disorder struggles with the opposite problem; without a strong internal monitor of his thoughts and actions, he finds it difficult to maintain self-control. He often acts impulsively in ways that interfere with his ability to relate intimately to others, to successfully pursue a career, or to obtain satisfaction in life. The treatment of a personality disorder focuses initially on helping the patient to actively observe, evaluate, and control his behavior to improve his functioning and stabilize his life. Then it facilitates the patient in restoring his sense of self.

> The dichotomy between neurosis and personality disorder is not as clear-cut as it may appear. There probably are no purely neurotic patients; people who appear to be neurotic in most respects probably have areas of themselves that they have closed off, causing them occasionally to function more like people with a personality disorder than like neurotics. There can, however, be unfortunate consequences if a therapist mistakes a patient with an extensive personality disorder for a neurotic. If this should happen, the therapist will probably focus on loosening up the self-control of the patient, whose self-conttrol is already marginal. The patient is then likely to become increasingly dependent upon the therapist to provide an external supplement of structure, support, and control.

Moving on to the specific things that separate the neurotic person from the person with BPD/NPD/Schizoid PD/AsPD, Manfield discusses defenses:

> In general it is the defenses of the person with a personality disorder that appear most dysfunctional to an observer. The inner feelings of pain, worthlessness, self-hatred, despair, depression, and isolation are usually only partially experienced by the person before they are defended against: the observer only sees the defenses. The defenses used are usually maladaptive in that they are mechanisms to achieve a temporary reprieve from dysphoric affect in exchange for an undermining of self-esteem and functioning. To the observer, these defenses appear to be self-defeating. To the person with the personality disorder, they actually appear to operate in his own self-interest

**What are these defenses? What makes a defense a neurotic defense instead of a psychotic defense? Where do these personality disorders fall in terms of defenses?**

> In Vaillant's (1977) hierarchy of defenses, he labels the most primitive defenses as psychotic defenses and the most mature sets of defenses as neurotic and healthy defenses. In between are the defenses commonly used by personality disorders. The defenses that Vaillant categorizes as psychotic defenses are denial of external reality, distortion, and delusional projection. The relatively healthy defenses include intellectualization (isolation, obsessive behavior, undoing, rationalization), repression, reaction formation, displacement (conversion, phobias, wit), and neurotic denial. The most mature defenses are sublimation, altruism, suppression, anticipation, and humor. As defenses commonly used by personality disorders, Vaillant includes fantasy (schizoid withdrawal, denial through fantasy), projection, hypochondriasis, passive-aggressive behavior (masochism, turning against self, and acting out. To this last list might be added splitting, clinging, distancing, projective identification, denial, avoidance, and grandiosity (including devaluation).

**Back to self-awareness and the need to be ruthlessly self-critical so that you can finally, finally fix whatever it is that causes people to reject you**

When you look at the levels of defenses, it is pretty easy to see that BPD is closer to neurotic/healthy than NPD would be. People with NPD have more access to defenses that blind them to the truth of what happened. People with BPD don't have that luxury in many cases.

**TL;DR:** 

**People with BPD do use defenses that cloud their ability to see the situation accurately. (That is, as others in this post have noted, where skill building comes in. As you develop coping skills, you have less and less need for the defenses that cloud your self-awareness.)**

**People with BPD use defenses that cloud their self-awareness less often than those with other, similar disorders such as NPD. Even at an untreated stage, people with BPD have much more self-awareness than people with other trauma-based disorders do.**"
Borderline,fiomkma,t3_f8x7di,1582586163.0,"No, he is not correct. He has misunderstood something.

**People with BPD are unusually self-aware compared to those with the other similar personality disorders or others with a similar trauma history**

Why? Because BPD has the hyperarousal and panic that insists that if you can respond perfectly enough to every tiny clue, you will finally get past that unknowable reason that makes people reject you.

If you are desperately focused on responding perfectly, you aren't invested in protecting your own view of yourself. Being wrapped up in your own ego won't help you to become the kind of person they want. People with BPD tend to be ruthlessly self-critical, leading to self-hatred to a degree that you don't see in the other trauma-based disorders. You will be acutely aware of every weakness, every vulnerability, and every mistake.

**Why would anyone think that BPD lacks insight, then?**

There are two reasons. One is hidden in the reason why it was originally named Borderline. It was thought of as being on the border between neurosis and psychosis. That is no longer seen as accurate but it does point toward some great information on why people with BPD seem both self-aware and incapable of insight. I will explore that in more depth in another comment here.

The other is in the much more casual observation that someone who has a stereotypical presentation of untreated BPD can be relied upon to do wildly destructive things in their relationships. They claim that they recognize the destruction, but wait, do they really?

People who don't know much about the inner workings of BPD will say that there is no way that someone with BPD could truly have self-awareness. Someone who *really* was aware of their own actions and feelings would see that they are causing huge problems and they would stop using the same tactics that end up destroying everything in their path.

What they are missing is that someone who is acting out because of their BPD is responding to temporary states of being completely overwhelmed by emotions and other mental processes. Anyone is going to flail wildly when they are past their ability to think clearly.

When that trouble with thinking clearly is because you are on the edge of losing out on a relationship again, you are going to try anything that feels like it will decrease the momentary distress and reduce the terror of loss. That results in flailing wildly and damaging the relationship. At least, it will until you learn to tamp that down and tear yourself apart instead of tearing your relationship apart.

Then the emotional seizure finally stops and you are stuck looking around at the devastation, hating yourself for every mistake you made. You know what happened and you know what you would change if you could take it all back. But you can't. And you can't stop it from happening again and again. Not without treatment, that is.

**TL;DR:**

**People with BPD are intensely aware of the problems with their own behavior. Others think that people with BPD lack awareness because isn't the definition of insanity, ""Trying the same thing and expecting different results""?**

**Well, no. But they don't know that. Don't trust adages as carriers of ultimate truth about mental health.**"
BorderlinePDisorder,fimm839,t1_fim56pa,1582536752.0,"Interesting.

People assume that it's rage that causes people with BPD to spin out of control. It's not. It's panic. It's terror of the past repeating itself yet again. Someone with BPD has a history of caregivers being absent or rejecting in times of extreme distress. They most likely also have a history of being punished for mistakes that weren't their fault (which is also almost guaranteed to happen in ADHD too, which might explain a lot of the overlap in symptoms between them).

People with BPD grew up surrounded by people who ran hot and cold. In their experience, any warmth only lasts so long, and eventually any trust that has been built is rewarded by intolerable pain and rejection. They are constantly looking for the source of the next betrayal. They panic when they see any indication of possible betrayal.

Because people with BPD are panicking at the slightest betrayal (or just at imagined betrayal), their panic looks completely bonkers to onlookers. Other people can't fathom why someone with BPD is so paranoid about every tiny little hint of trouble in a relationship. Why can't they give their partner some credit? Why do they always expect the worst when someone has been nothing but good to them? (Because they have suffered betrayal every time they have dared to trust.)

The person with BPD doesn't understand why they always seem to overreact. After the panic is over, they come back to themselves and look at their actions and hate themselves for freaking out again over stupid things that shouldn't bother them. (But in truth, it makes sense that it bothers them. It would be foolish to blindly trust after so many experiences of betrayal. It is self-protective to watch for the tiniest hints that the next betrayal is starting, especially because they still hold out hope that they can stop the betrayal if they act fast enough and react perfectly to every tiny shift in the relationship.)

Back to what you were describing...  Some disorders make people prone to rage, but only when there are certain circumstances that aggravate their specific symptoms. Bipolar can get there depending on where the cycle is at, and it's most likely to be in response to someone trying to interfere with their activities. Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Histrionic Personality Disorder will do that when they are humiliated or emotionally injured. Antisocial Personality Disorder can get there when their sense of control is threatened.

Now, looking specifically at the incidents you mentioned...

As a side note, that comment the boss made to your girlfriend is shocking and horrible. Some people are unbelievably horrible.

The incidents you described would spark strong anger in any reasonable person. Your anger was obviously warranted, and it was in a moment where you weren't afraid to burn bridges. It was rationally justified. If you discribed the incidents in a Reddit post, people would be outraged on your behalf. The only thing remarkable about them was the escalation to blinding rage.

Rage in itself is an unhealthy coping mechanism. It is the opposite of numbing yourself out to avoid anger, but both happen because of avoidance. It is the result of ignoring your anger until it is so big that your impulse control can't keep hold of it.

Rage isn't really a feature of any mental disorder. It's just an indication of extreme, unmanageable distress. The distress could be purely environmental, as might be the case when you stay in a caustic workplace until you can't control your urges to lash out. It could be in response to distress caused by a mental disorder, as I noted above. But in that case, the rage will be in response to a vulnerable spot specific to that disorder. In a situation where anger is a reasonable response, rage indicates a lack of coping skills, not a mental disorder.

Clinginess, neediness, partners not being allowed to be upset, and shutting partners out, those are things that are typical of several of the personality disorders: BPD, Dependent Personality Disorder (DPD), Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD), and Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). CPTSD and ADHD with rejection sensitivity will do it, too. There's no way to tell between them without knowing more about what situations increased those behaviors and what meanings you came up with to explain your partner's behavior and your own behavior. Of those, I still think that CPTSD, DPD, and ADHD are the most likely culprits because I haven't heard you describe any vulnerabilities or behaviors that are particular to BPD, NPD, or HPD.

And here's a side note about Dependent Personality Disorder and angry or rejecting behaviors... It's easy to assume that someone with DPD is going to be biddable and easy-going, but that is absolutely not true when their needs aren't being met.

The longer a relationship goes on, the person with untreated DPD is going to need more and more devotion to feel safe enough, eventually getting to the point where the partner honestly can't fill those needs no matter how hard they try. At that point, the person with DPD starts displaying any behavior that might increase their partner's efforts.

That begins with loving behaviors, shifts to the behaviors that have prompted pity and caregiving in the past, and eventually resorts to anger, rejection, or emotionally abusive tactics. They are trying desperately to get their partner to give them that little bit more that will make things feel good again. Anger, rejection, and emotionally abusive tactics work and the partner sacrifices their own needs to give that little bit more. Eventually that stops being enough and another round of anger, rejection, or emotional abuse is needed to prompt greater sacrifice. That continues until the relationship becomes impossible."
BorderlinePDisorder,fim2koc,t3_f8i33y,1582516447.0,"It is impossible to diagnose someone without at least doing quite a bit of question-and-answer to dig into not just what problems have happened but to get more details about why and how. I can't tell you anything definitive. But maybe I can tell you some directions to look in.

First, I think most people desperately underestimate how damaging and life-altering ADHD is, and it gets worse when you move into adulthood because there is so much more that you are responsible for, and so much less support to catch you when you fall. If you're saying ""it can't just be ADHD,"" it makes me wonder if you have a full appreciation of how nasty ADHD can be, emotionally.

[Here's an article](https://www.additudemag.com/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-and-adhd/) that gives a good introduction to the emotional and social problems ADHD causes.

On top of that, there are going to be some CPTSD-type symptoms from the constant battle where you fail at things that are so easy for everyone else. Caregivers and teachers don't usually grasp how ADHD works internally, so they end up pushing when pushing is the last thing that will help. They punish when you did the best you could, leaving you with the lesson that you deserve punishment for failure no matter how hard you try. And it's incredibly hard to stand up for yourself when you are so used to being to blame, so your boundaries are usually in shambles.

What you described mostly falls within what I would expect for someone with ADHD if they have a strong tendency toward the rejection-sensitive symptoms. And someone who does have ADHD with high rejection sensitivity has a huge overlap in symptoms with someone with BPD. I can't emphasize this enough. People don't know how damaging and brutal ADHD can be.

On to BPD. I didn't get much of a BPD feel from what you said. It might be that it's there but it would only be apparent with a proper session of questions to see what is underneath the things you have struggled with. One big thing I didn't catch in your description of your upbringing and childhood was any indication of a severe attachment disorder. Another big thing that makes BPD unlikely is that you note that you were oblivious to the effects of your behavior in high school and college.

The emotional sensitivity is something that could be directly related to the ADHD or it could simply be a temperament you were born with. And note, some researchers think that people with BPD are born with emotional sensitivity as a temperament, and that made them vulnerable to developing BPD. The emotional sensitivity in BPD might not be a symptom. It might instead be a prerequisite.

If you do have something on top of the ADHD, I would suspect CPTSD and/or dependent personality disorder. I wouldn't be surprised if people with ADHD are especially prone to CPTSD and dependent personality disorder. The dissociative features are common in BPD but they're even more common in CPTSD. The behavior you have shown in your relationships would fit with CPTSD or dependent personality disorder. But the ADHD with rejection sensitivity would have been more than enough to explain how that happened.

As for treatment, look into DBT (dialectical behavior therapy). That really is one of the best things around for helping with emotional sensitivity and impulsivity. Often, DBT is offered in a group setting and it is usually available even at low-cost clinics that offer mental health services. You may be able to get treatment for free or almost free. If you live near a large or medium-sized city in the US, it's extremely likely that you can get cheap or free DBT treatment.

The things DBT doesn't address are the inner conflicts that are actually causing your emotional pain. DBT helps you cope with your symptoms in a healthier way, but it doesn't get rid of the symptoms. For that, look into anything that is designed for CPTSD. The problems in ADHD with rejection sensitivity are close enough to CPTSD that everything should be applicable.

I hope this gives you some good places to start. Good luck!"
BPDmemes,fikqt04,t1_fij59f8,1582485493.0,"Thank you, thank you, thank you! This is the stuff I didn't know how to look for. You really made my day. The best days are the ones where you find there's a whole new corner of interesting stuff you never knew existed.

And that is fascinating, that they're tying social sensitivity to sensory sensitivity. So much new stuff to see here.

This leads me to wonder, if being a HSP is tied to sensory sensitivity, and being an HSP means vulnerability to developing BPD, are we seeing a higher rate of sensory sensitivity in people with BPD? I haven't heard of it being a common trait of BPD, but of course I never thought to look for it."
BPDmemes,fiiwey7,t1_fihtdxm,1582428596.0,"You're right, it doesn't. CPTSD doesn't exist, according to DSM 5. CPTSD is a proposed diagnosis that was suggested for the DSM-IV and the DSM 5, but the DSM has not decided to adopt it yet.

DSM 5 includes PTSD, which can have a dissociative subtype. But the DSM 5's description of PTSD doesn't acknowledge the chronic, repeated trauma associated with CPTSD.

The latest edition of the ICD (the ICD-11) has added an entry for CPTSD. (The ICD is used outside the US instead of the DSM.)

Since the ICD and the DSM are usually similar on mental health diagnoses, it wouldn't be surprising if the DSM picked up CPTSD as a valid diagnosis in future editions. But there's no guarantee because the DSM isn't associated with the ICD."

BPDmemes,fiiu349,t1_fih46bh,1582426915.0,"I pulled a lot of this from Jennifer Ablow's work. [Here is a link](https://dslab.uoregon.edu/about/research-2/) that describes some of the work she's doing.

More generally, Marsha Linehan has been saying for years that BPD can result from an invalidating environment. You can have an invalidating environment that doesn't include any behaviors that we would typically label as abusive. It may be that a parent is very different from their child, and they don't have the cognitive and emotional flexibility to make room for those differences. It's not abuse, but it is traumatic to have such a deep lack of validation that the child doubts their own experience.

In his book, Philip Manfield wrote:

> Masterson might liken the borderline adult to a frightened child who has never grown up, an adult child searching for the ""good"" mother whom he never really had. The good mother is loving, warm, nurturing, kind, and supportive. The borderline adult tries to be good, helpless, and cooperative, even submissive, in order to maintain the affection of the good mothers he is able to find. Nevertheless, he constantly fears that if he is too independent, too competent, or too capable, his good mothers will suddenly turn away and abandon him. Life becomes a subtle conflict between the inner (""real"") self of the borderline that wants to grow up and become an independent and confident adult, and the defensive self that feels anxious whenever he does anything self-supportive, because such behavior is linked to a fear of a loss of the good mother. Without the love of the good mother, the borderline's euphoria turns to dysphoria, and his self-image changes from that of a good person to that of a bad person. Instead of praise, he expects criticism and attack from the bad mother, and he feels lonely, unloved, angry, or guilty for the ""trouble"" he has apparently caused.

> The borderline manages simultaneously to hold to these two mutually contradictory realities, the good world and the bad, by paying attention to only one at a given time. He is conscious of both realities. However, the reality that is split off occupies a dormant status, holding no emotional immediacy. The ability to juggle these two mutually contradictory realities in this way is known as the borderline split.

> As practiced by an infant, the splitting defense represents a healthy attempt to protect the internal image of the ""good"" mother upon whom the infant's survival is dependent. The negative aspects of the caretaker are split off and literally thought of as belonging to someone else. Mahler (1975) describes as an example of this a 2 1/2-year-old boy who is feeling angry and deserted by his mother who has been away from him several days in a hospital. In the morning, when the mother calls the boy on the telephone, he clings to her, unwilling to hang up for forty-five minutes. He denies, however, that the person to whom he is talking is his mother, saying he is talking to a ""nice lady."" In so doing he protects his image of the ""nice lady"" to whom he clings from the angry feelings he feels toward his mother.

The formation of BPD does not require abuse. Many people with BPD have not experienced abuse. But it does seem to require trauma, and that trauma is going to be in the realm of emotional neglect and rejection. Often, it's the result of having parents who aren't quite capable of [good-enough parenting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_enough_parent). But there's plenty of room to fail at being a good-enough parent without having behavior that qualifies as abusive."
BPDmemes,fiiii7h,t1_fihb9x6,1582422038.0,"Thanks! I tried to get into Porges' book but I fear that neuropsychology doesn't come easy to me. Still, from what I can gather, polyvagal theory has tremendous potential to become the foundation of trauma work.

It's opening up a brand new set of treatments. Since these changes are physiologically measurable, maybe some day we'll see children undergoing routine screenings that could identify which kids need intervention. Could you imagine if we didn't need to rely on reports of abuse to identify which children needed help? If we had hard data to say which foster homes were absolutely unacceptable and which ones were relatively safe? Maybe even a way to quantifiably show that someone is in need of disability services due to their level of traumatization? Amazing stuff.

He has an entire chapter called ""Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Regulation"" in the book he published in 2011. It includes a study that ""provides the first report of unique charanteristics of autonomic regulation associated with the diagnosis of BPD."" The study concludes: 

> It is possible that the neuroception of the environment provides an invalid indicator of risk for individuals with BPD. Thus, rather than being calm in the presence of another ""nonthreatening"" human, the autonomic nervous system is regulated to a state that supports fight or flight and not a state that would support spontaneous social engagement. If invalid neuroception accurately describes individuals with BPD, it may partially explain why BPD patients have a variety of poor outcomes, especially related to social relationships and emotional instability in relationships.

That matches what we've seen through observation, where people with BPD approach any social situation, especially when it comes to important relationships, with a frantic focus on categorizing and optimizing their responses to get the best possible outcome. This happens because of perceived danger, but it becomes so pervasive that it is eventually their consistent pattern of how they engage with other people.

People miss some of the picture when they only focus on the shortcomings that can cause. The bigger picture, I figure, is that the person with BPD is truly driven to do the best they can in social situations. Their fear and corresponding hyperarousal gets in the way and leads to hasty missteps. But there's also a positive aspect of being deeply invested in relationships. That is a strength that persists through treatment and eventually serves as a big positive in future relationships.

Yes, it originated as a fear response. But it creates a manner of relating to the world that is inherently pro-social. Given some treatment to smooth out the difficulties, I think that people with BPD have some special traits and strengths to contribute to the world, once they learn to protect themselves and gain a sense of safety."
BPDmemes,fii7xgt,t1_fih89sg,1582418390.0,"You make a good point about hypervigilance. There's no question that there's plenty of that in BPD.

Honestly interested here -- do you have any evidence that sensitivity/intuition/empathy is inborn and unchangeable? I find that counterintuitive. Empathy levels change with the stages of child development. Empathy relies on the ability to imagine oneself in another's place, so it also requires non-literal thinking, which develops with age. Perspective taking is something that babies are clearly not born with. Although there are some instinctual components to nonverbal cues, as can be seen with people born blind, there is also a lot of room to teach social cues to someone who is deficient, as in autism. Intuition relies on subconscious pattern recognition, so that develops with experience and experimentation.

Just opinion here, but to me that means that someone with BPD has a high likelihood of being an especially apt student, mostly because the hypervigilence and distress push them to excel at attaining these skills that develop through childhood and into adulthood.

Or am I missing your meaning?


Edited to add: I have read the Elaine Aron book. She does give the impression that being a HSP is an inborn trait, so I don't blame anyone for assuming that it is. I don't see anything in her research that backs that up, though. In her research, she's judging who is a HSP based on scales that an adult or child is rated against. That doesn't give you any information on whether that HSP was, as an infant, more sensitive than other infants."

BPDmemes,fih1rjj,t1_fifahhr,1582405546.0,"The ""sensitive"" argument is fun.

Okay, maybe people with BPD do start out with more sensitivity than other children. Maybe.

But what is certain is that people with BPD have a desperate need to develop as much sensitivity as they can so that they can protect themselves and keep circumstances from going wrong.

If you weren't unusually sensitive before BPD took hold, BPD will push you into becoming as unusually sensitive as you can be. Before you can claim that people with BPD were born with greater sensitivity, you have to prove that the sensitivity happened before the onset of BPD, not after.

Edit: Don't miss [the comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bpdmemes/comments/f7seqj/_/fij59f8) below where u/iamhalfmachine gave some solid evidence against my claim that there wasn't proof of an inborn sensitivity. Neuropsychology is amazing."
BPDmemes,figyb4c,t1_fig5dxs,1582404608.0,"It's tricky because it takes some digging to really understand the definition of trauma.

We usually think of trauma as any shocking incident that makes the world seem unsafe and rocks our sense of what the world is like. That's a good starting point. But it can be really subtle, especially when that shock is a matter of a child not getting the emotional support that they absolutely need in order to develop a healthy sense of self.

BPD happens when a child cannot develop trust in the feeling that their caregivers will forgive them and love them no matter what they do. This failure doesn't require blatant abuse. It could simply be that a parent is easily distracted by siblings or other worries and routinely doesn't notice that their child is reaching out for their support.

This usually also includes experiences of being punished for things that the child couldn't have anticipated or prevented, often resulting from impulsivity that a child of that age cannot control. But the punishment might have been moderate and it may be that it would have been perfectly reasonable for an older child, who had more self-control. The parents believe that the punishment is justified, so they teach their child that the punishment was deserved and that the child should feel guilt or shame about the incident. The child is convinced that they deserved it, leaving the child with a sense that they deserve punishment even when they don't know any better or when they can't resist the impulsive action that they took.

Looking back, that person may not see any signs that their home environment was harmful. Their siblings may have had a supportive upbringing. Their parents may have never noticed that the child was upset or troubled, or they had some other explanation that allowed them to see that distress as minor and unimportant. No one recognizes that the punishments were too harsh for a child of a given age range because they may not remember what age they were when it happened, or they may think it's normal discipline for a child that young. A skilled observer probably could have spotted the fact that the child was unduly, inconsolably distressed, but that family may not have noticed it at the time.

This repeated failure to re-connect and re-establish safety still qualifies as trauma because that child has experienced emotional neglect. The child had needs that weren't met. They had no other way to get those needs met. The child was left without the emotional support that is required to develop a sense of safety in the world.

As the child becomes an adult, they probably don't even see it as neglect because that is their normal. BPD tells you that it's your fault that people reject you. It can be impossible to spot the rejections that shouldn't have happened when you have become convinced that those rejections were normal and reasonable."
PsychologicalTricks,fig835g,t1_fif29m7,1582396984.0,"I don't see any reason to doubt that your bipolar diagnosis is accurate. I'm glad you have found meds that are helping! The trial and error of finding the right meds is a tough process.

Irritibility is something that makes me think in the direction of bipolar, depression, or anxiety, primarily. BPD will cause irritibility but it's more likely to be described as anger, resentment, or worse. And with BPD it wouldn't be a steady, building irritibility. It would be a lot more unpredictable and chaotic, with big, sudden shifts in mood. So you're right, this could just be the bipolar alone.

BPD has a lot of other differences from bipolar when it comes to beliefs about relationships and the ways that the inner turmoil plays out. The two disorders look very similar when you are just observing behavior but they are very different when you start asking questions about what a person experiences. A professional who is familiar with BPD should be able to easily screen you for it.

Setting BPD aside, any mental illness takes a huge toll on a marriage. As you know all too well, bipolar is one of the big ones that cause relationship instability because of the consequences it causes and because the shifts in mood can be so extreme that the relationship has to be put on hold until things calm back down. That can leave you with a fragile relationship that needs a lot of repair to re-establish the connection you used to have.

Couples counseling can help tremendously if the illness has caused damage to the relationship. It can also help you two find new ways to relate now that you're doing so much better and can be there for her.

If couples counseling isn't an option, there are some therapies you can try that would help. ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy) is great for when things feel overwhelming and unfixable and there are challenges with self-confidence.  For distress tolerance and emotional regulation, you can't beat DBT (dialectical behavior therapy). CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) helps with letting you change your automatic reactions by looking at your thoughts and assumptions.

She might benefit from Al-Anon, the group that supports family members of alcoholics, because that is about sorting out the feelings and unhealthy reactions that are typical for someone in a caretaker/supportive role for someone who has periods of mood instability and inability to handle responsibilities. Especially if you have times where you feel like she treats you like a child, Al-Anon is something that can help smooth that out."
PsychologicalTricks,fidybdc,t1_fidrgv3,1582372832.0,"A child's distress or behavioral problems gets to you because you only know the child's perspective. You know what it is to be inconsolable or so upset that nothing else seems to exist. You probably didn't get to see many examples of adults handling it well.

When you did see it handled well, you were consumed with wondering what it would have been like to be treated that way. And then that collides with your sense that you didn't deserve kindness. And that drags you into all the reasons you've internalized about being unworthy.

You don't have the slightest chance to imagine being the parent and try out what it would be like to respond to that child.

This automatic habit of taking the child's perspective is actually your own natural longing to revisit the past and discover a better outcome. But without a therapist to guide you, it ends up in the same old heartbreak.

The bottom line here is, you have to work out your own feelings about your neglect before you have children, or you will be interacting with them from a child's perspective. This isn't impossible. Once you find a therapist you really click with, you're looking at a couple of years of work.

After you have explored that with a therapist and found some new, kinder perspectives on it, you should be able to gain confidence by taking parenting classes. You aren't alone in having no idea of how to parent. There is help out there to teach you how to give your kids a healthy upbringing."
PsychologicalTricks,fidopx5,t1_fidbeuq,1582369632.0,"Parental suicide is devastating, not just from the loss but also from the conflicted feelings it creates in everyone who knew the parent. That is a recipe for creating an environment where the emotional needs of the child comes last.

That is so horrible because adults can tolerate times of emotional neglect, but children literally need the emotional support. Going without causes great harm as the child finds any coping mechanisms they can. That means destructive self-blame and a loss of all sense that they are okay as a person and that their emotions are valid.

The classic ""inner child"" idea is almost peaceful. The sad, scared child is rejected and safely locked away, and the adult gets to choose whether they want to set aside their resentment and hatred to offer love to that child. And if the adult can't offer that truce, life goes on as usual, with a quiet little wound buried in the background.

It's a shame it isn't that easy when you grow up with this level of emotional neglect and rejection. Instead, you end up with a survival instinct that is feral and it's stronger than you. It freaks out at the wrong things and doesn't listen to reason. Obey it, and you end up destroying your relationships or yourself. Ignore it, and it will carve you up with every regret and weakness until you have no fight left in you because you're bleeding and broken.

When you're ready, you might want to look into therapists who do IFS (Internal Family Systems) Therapy. It is designed to sort out that level of inner conflict that constantly threatens to tear you apart. I have also heard good things about Schema Therapy which digs into the beliefs that the world is hostile and you are unsafe. I hope you find something that brings you to a sense that you are wanted and worthwhile for who you truly are."

PsychologicalTricks,ficrb80,t3_f7mvr4,1582354925.0,"This is awkward to say, but I think you need to check for another diagnosis on top of bipolar. What you described isn't typical for bipolar but it is very typical for something else that is often misdiagnosed as bipolar. It can also happen that someone has both, and that means that it's easy to miss it because it looks so much like bipolar, so it's hiding behind it.

You described mixed mania that is usually triggered by an argument with your wife. Unless I'm misunderstanding, this isn't usual for bipolar. Bipolar isn't typically that reactive to emotional upsets.

If these episodes are more likely to happen at random times throughout a week that has an unusual amount of emotional distress, that could be bipolar.

But if they're happening immediately after emotional distress spikes, like with an argument or anticipating an argument, or in response to a worry or a memory, that's not from your bipolar. Bipolar doesn't react immediately to your thoughts or feelings.

You said that you're terrified of making the slightest mistake because you fear that the most important person in your life will leave you. This is the hallmark symptom of BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). BPD also comes with those emotional seizures that really do look a lot like a bipolar mixed episode but they're in reaction to relationship stress (real, imagined, or remembered).

In men, a common way that BPD manifests is as [discouraged BPD](https://www.optimumperformanceinstitute.com/bpd-treatment/discouraged-borderline-personality-disorder/). Some people refer to that as quiet BPD. That's when someone holds most of their turmoil inside, but it's still unbearable and it leads to a lot of self-destructive behavior.

For someone with BPD, there is a long history of being punished or rejected for making mistakes. The world they grew up in was unpredictable, and punishment or disapproval could come out of nowhere. That leads someone to have a frantic way of assessing every relationship that matters to them because they desperately want to avoid the next mistake.

The good news is, BPD is very treatable. Don't let the ""personality disorder"" label scare you into thinking that it's permanent. All that means is, it was a big factor in the development of someone's personality. There is effective treatment that undoes that damage so that the person's true personality can finally be shown.

Thank you!

BPD is about having extreme emotional reactions to issues in relationships and other interpersonal interactions. Untreated, someone with BPD might lash out at others, but that's not representative of all untreated people with BPD. So many of them have learned long ago that lashing out just makes things worse, so instead, they internalize it as self-hatred and self-destruction. That's when you see people who cope mainly through addiction and violence against themselves.

On top of that, BPD is extremely treatable. Even those who were abusive initially can and do learn to stop the lashing out behaviors. In my experience, it takes 1-2 years to get there.

""BPD = abuse"" is a horrible, horrible stigma that the illness carries. The ones who were abusive are the ones that people talk about. The ones who aren't abusive are often so good at hiding their illness, their best friends wouldn't know. And they don't tell their best friends because of long experience that people then blame every upset or objection on their BPD, making it impossible to be taken seriously and treated fairly.

The ""BPD = abuse"" attitude is often fueled by those who have been abused by someone with BPD, as a common attitude is that others should be protected from people with BPD so that they don't get abused. They figure, who cares if a few non-abusive people with BPD hear that claim? If they're not abusive, it wasn't about them anyway. And it's important to protect people from abuse.

But that's not how it works with BPD. Even those who have never been abusive and who have it so hidden that no one would ever know, they are deeply injured by that stigma because it feels like everyone is saying that it is their nature to be abusive, and it's only through all the self-abusive and self-hating behavior that they avoid doing what others have done.

Thank you for saying that it's not all people with BPD.

(I'm married to someone with BPD.  No one else in his life knows he has BPD except for one person who also has BPD. I have never seen him abuse anyone but himself.)"

BPD,fapp1q2,t1_fapa5f7,1576291349.0,"I say this as someone who is in a healthy, happy relationship with someone with BPD:

Abuse is real. Some people are absolutely horrible to other people. Some of those people have BPD, which makes the abuse happen in predictible ways.

I've been in an abusive relationship with someone who didn't have BPD. (It was probably dependent personality disorder.) What he did was not okay. I needed to leave the relationship and never look back.

But I do recognize that I made choices prior to the onset of abuse that led to its ugly conclusion. I put myself in the place of 'helper' and let him lean on me again and again until I was absolutely drained. I thought it was the least I could do. I loved him and I didn't want to see him suffer. But the more I let him lean, the more he became afraid to be independent. And it was at the end, where he was more dependent than he ever had been, that he started abusing me for being unavailable.

So, no, I don't put the blame entirely on him. He's to blame for all of the abusive behaviors he employed. But it would be unfair of me to say that all people with dependent PD were abusive and should be avoided at all costs. If I had maintained healthy boundaries from the beginning, it wouldn't have ended like that.

That's what the commenter was saying, I think. The abuse is the responsibility of the abuser. But there's no such thing as a relationship that doesn't have problems. If I blamed all of the problems and the missteps on ""my crazy dependent PD ex,"" I'd be ignoring the fact that my lack of healthy boundaries is what fueled the fire, drawing the first day of abuse closer, robbing him of opportunities to develop better coping skills (because I was always there to catch him) and making it impossible for me to see any warning signs that would have allowed me to leave before the abuse started.

Now, after the first day of the abuse, that was entirely his fault. I just own that if I had held healthy boundaries, it probably wouldn't have gotten to that point. And if I'd had any ability to have boundaries, I wouldn't have tolerated the abuse for as long as I did.

There are relationships where you can have healthy boundaries all you want, and your partner still is abusive. That's when your healthy boundaries carry you right back out of that relationship.

That relationship taught me what I needed to know to have a very healthy relationship with the man I married who has BPD. We've been together five years. From day one, I've made sure he knew exactly what was okay and what wasn't. BPD doesn't like to hear that, but I trusted him to tolerate it anyway. And he did. We both check each other when he starts relying on me too much. Fortunately, it makes him anxious to rely on me, so he'll usually retreat before I even see there's a problem.

He has never been abusive toward me. He's had times when he wanted to. I gave him room to be apart from me until he could cool down. He can't control the rage that happens sometimes, but he never takes it out on me."

BPD,fapgq3d,t3_eab5vk,1576287841.0,"This is because you have had too many experiences of not being forgiven for making mistakes. Average, healthy people would get angry at not being forgiven for making an honest mistake. People with BPD go into a flurry of self-doubt and recrimination in a desperate attempt to change anything that could have possibly prevented the mistake.

You feel an unbearable amount of shame, guilt, and panic at the idea of offending or upsetting someone because you know you won't be forgiven, no matter how well-intentioned you were when the offense or upset happened, no matter how hard you try to make it right.

And here's the thing... it's completely normal to be that terrified of making mistakes when you have such a history of not being forgiven. Anyone would be. This isn't a matter of being broken or wrong.

It's a matter of not having enough of a recent history of good relationships where you were forgiven for your mistakes. It would be dumb of you to suddenly decide that it's okay to make a mistake -- because honestly, it never has been.

And it has never been enough to just reason your way through it and try to find the best ways to prevent the next situation. You need to be constantly vigilant for any new idea, any opportunity, any sign that you might miss. And that's why you tell yourself that you're horrible. Having that huge emotional judgment against yourself makes it so that your attention keeps its deadly focus on not slipping up again.

You have a mind that is absolutely optimised to operate in an environment where no one gives you a fair chance. If you can never be forgiven, it's imperative to spend all your energy trying to prevent mistakes. There's nothing wrong with you.

You have the right to know the truth, even though it's hard to hear it. You have the right to know where the lines are.

You are only responsible for behaving in a non-aggressive, fair manner. Their feelings are their own problem. Their failure to maintain healthy boundaries are their problem.

In a healthy relationship, it would be okay and even expected for you to make any request you like. The other person would be expected to say no if it isn't okay with them.

You aren't responsible for those times when a helper has helped you so much that they hurt themselves.

They're responsible for knowing what they can do without risking their own welfare. They're responsible for saying no before they push themselves that far. They have the ability to say no. And if they don't, they're the biggest part of the problem."

> Elimination of the Multi-Axial System and GAF Score

> One of the key changes from DSM-IV to DSM-5 is the elimination of the multi-axial system. DSM-IV approached psychiatric assessment and organization of biopsychosocial information using a multi-axial formulation (American Psychiatric Association, 2013b). There were five different axes. Axis I consisted of mental health and substance use disorders (SUDs); Axis II was reserved for personality disorders and mental retardation; Axis III was used for coding general medical conditions; Axis IV was to note psychosocial and environmental problems (e.g., housing, employment); and Axis V was an assessment of overall functioning known as the GAF. The GAF scale was dropped from the DSM-5 because of its conceptual lack of clarity (i.e., including symptoms, suicide risk, and disabilities in the descriptors) and questionable psychometric properties (American Psychiatric Association, 2013b).
Although the impact of removing the overall multi-axial structure in DSM-5 is unknown, there is concern among clinicians that eliminating the structured approach for gathering and organizing clinical assessment data will hinder clinical practice (Frances, 2010). However, the direct impact on the prevalence rates of childhood mental disorders is likely to be negligible as it will not affect the characteristics of diagnoses.

The unfortunate thing is, the DSM isn't written for us (the patients and their family). It's not even written for the clinicians who treat patients. Its purpose is to clearly define populations of people so that researchers can study differences between those populations. That's why the stupid book describes BPD as a bunch of symptoms instead of describing the inner conflicts that create BPD. Because a competent therapist interviewing a patient can readily see what conflicts are there. But if you're a researcher you want to give a quick, standardized questionnaire for presence of symptoms and move on to testing for whatever you're trying to study.

It's almost accidental that it's also somewhat useful in clinical treatment. It is useful for diagnosis because it does help therapists recognize what problems their patients have. At the same time, there are tons of therapists out there who don't like the idea of diagnosing people and would rather just treat each person as an individual.

As it's currently written, therapists should not be relying only on the DSM for information on what is going on with their patient and how to treat it. Optimally, they'd change the DSM so that it does also address the needs of therapists and patients because that's what it's used for. But that's not going to happen. It's too important to them that it addresses the needs of the researchers without a bunch of extra fluff.

And since the DSM isn't going to change, it's the therapists' training that should be blamed for failing to teach them these things. What really needs to happen is, they need to create a clinical manual that is designed to be used alongside the DSM in clinical practice. It could contain all the information on internal conflicts and likely treatments for particular symptom profiles.

Other disorders have subcategories within the diagnosis. With the DSM-5, PTSD gained two subcategories -- the standard one and one that's based on dissociation. This is incredibly important because these two groups actually look different on an fMRI. The standard group is the one with all the hyperarousal symptoms. The dissociative group actually gets calmer under stressful conditions. This louses up the research terribly if you don't sort out which one you have in front of you.

But it's of no use to researchers to have a diagnosis that separates people with quiet BPD because it's really all the same internally. One just has more externalizing symptoms. And if the researcher wants to divide the participants, all they have to do is separate them by which ones check off more externalizing symptoms on the questionnaire."

But being there during those beginning stages, when they're going through a second adolescence of sorts, is hard. It's not something I'd be eager to do again.

Where it gets hurtful is when that becomes an example of ""what people with BPD are like"" because there are so many more who are very careful not to take their splitting out on others. Treatment teaches them to recognize it and make better decisions about it. Someone who has some coping skills on board will recognize that the splitting isn't real and that they should not act on that feeling."
BPD,faoi3vf,t1_faoetmy,1576264851.0,"Get a new therapist. That's not okay. You're working with one of those (unfortunately, common) professionals who don't actually see the good in people with BPD. They think they're there to hold you accountable for everything you say and do that doesn't match what a mentally healthy person would say and do.

That's not even a useful way to treat BPD. People with BPD already have an overabundance of holding themselves accountable for every failing, whether it was their fault or not. And when they don't, it's because they're so desperately tired of caring because all that 'holding themselves accountable' didn't make it any better, either.

There's a lot about BPD that is honestly utterly reasonable given the context. Things like, obviously you're going to have a hard time trusting people when you've had experience after experience where people failed to forgive your honest mistakes, even though you really did everything you could think of to keep from making a mistake, and even though you would have done anything you could to make it right.

You'll get better so much faster if you have a therapist who gets that and who can work with you from where YOU are rather than from where 'healthy' people are."
BPD,faoh1px,t1_faof464,1576264173.0,Agreed. Not okay that he refused (it should be your choice) and not okay that he has a good point (that there's a ton of stigma even from psych professionals).
BPD,faogga8,t1_faofdah,1576263787.0,"I'm with you. I intensely dislike how people have decided that if you have BPD and you aren't in DBT, you aren't trying. I've gone through DBT myself, and it has a lot to offer... but only to certain people.

When you're depressed, it's your right to say you don't want to try certain medications. You could even refuse all of the antidepressants, if you wanted to, and the prescriber would try other things like antipsychotics that are good for depression. Why are providers refusing to treat BPD just because someone isn't interested in 'the' treatment for BPD?

In my opinion, the gold-standard for BPD treatment should be DBT and/or IFS (internal family systems). With an emphasis on the 'and/or' part."
BPD,faofq7v,t1_faoe6w9,1576263326.0,"I'd say, DBT is for those who are distressed by their behaviors. If the main issue in your life is currently that the people around you are upset with your behavior, DBT is the thing for that. But it's kind of an awkward, drawn-out, and boring thing to go through if your main need is handling your inner landscape and it completely ignores the fact that half of your terror and pain is completely reasonable, given the context.

If you're more of a quiet BPD type, you'll probably get more out of therapies that are designed for trauma than you'd get out of DBT. Especially check out internal family systems therapy, though. That is really good for any condition where it feels like there's part of you (like your emotions) that is tugging you in directions that you wouldn't choose for yourself.

Also, DBT is divided into four modules: mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness. You can choose to do only the modules that fit you. If the DBT around you is only group-based (like it usually is around here) and it's doing a module that doesn't appeal to you, you could ask the facilitator when they're starting the next module."

Reddit or not, it's horrible that there are forums out there that instantly assume that the person with BPD has caused all the bad things in the relationship. It's just not true. Even in a relationship where the other partner seems to be 'the good guy' you'll find a lot of behaviors that keep problems from being solved like judgmentalness and failure to communicate. You can tell by their language that they've lost faith in their partner. If you've lost faith in your partner, there's no way that you can be wholeheartedly supporting them in getting better.

You can approach a relationship where one person has a mental illness in one of two ways: both of you versus the problems arising from that illness, or a 'healthy' person versus an unhealthy one who is supposed to be getting better.

My husband has BPD. It's my job to learn better ways to cope with BPD, too. We don't really need to drag in the idea that the BPD is his. The only reason it even matters that it's his is that there are symptoms only he can feel and there are interventions only he can do. But that doesn't mean I can't be working on my own coping mechanisms, and that doesn't mean I can't practice his interventions with him. Being the partner who doesn't have BPD doesn't make me the perfect one who is entitled to sit outside and judge his progress."

Make sure your important papers like your birth certificate and social security card are where you can find them. Set aside some cash, if you can do so without it being noticed. Make sure you always have your cell phone and a power bank battery with you. And call around to the local self-defense schools to ask them for advice. They may have a few people who would be willing to sit with you when you're scared, whether that is of your attacker or of your own urges to strike back.

And that's not right. It's not fair. You guys have so much to offer. You are the ones who really will give everything to make a relationship good. You are the ones who are often so deeply aware of social cues that you can read the group and add something special to the gathering. You are the ones who are so deeply aware of everything meaningful in the world and who can show the rest of us the beauty we'd forgotten was there.

It's everyone's job to avoid demonizing given populations according to whatever horror story they've heard. Racism isn't something that minority groups should just be understanding about. It's something they should fight against, or it will just fester at the same level as each new generation comes of age.

And then the people listening, the ones who had never heard about BPD until then, decide that BPD is a diagnosis that means abusive psycho ex.

By simply saying that people with BPD are abusive, they shame everyone, no matter how careful those others are to never let anyone be hurt by what they suffer with every day."
BPD,fao7ucx,t1_fanvdbz,1576258973.0,"I wouldn't want them divided into two diagnoses because then the ones with regular BPD would be even further shamed for being the bad kind of BPD. None of you are bad or irredeemable.

Some are so wounded and without coping skills that they lash out like abused, injured animals. If they haven't been diagnosed and offered treatment that is not their fault and it's not okay to shame them. Even the most abusive person with BPD is only a few years of hard work away from getting rid of those behaviors.

Also, there aren't any diagnoses in the DSM where you become one diagnosis when you've gone through enough treatment for another one. That's what that pair of diagnoses would be.

Quiet BPD is BPD without the externalizing behaviors, which DBT can teach. Though, it teaches it by offering healthy coping mechanisms. Which adds up to, the person with regular BPD plus DBT would actually be healthier than the untreated person with quiet BPD.

(Unrelated note that I can't resist mentioning when I mention DBT: DBT is not enough. It adds coping skills but it doesn't fix the terror that fuels BPD. Trauma-based therapies are necessary to address that.)"
BPD,fak7vsc,t1_fajz486,1576162483.0,"Exactly. People with BPD are often very good at anticipating people. They're often much better at it than the average person is. BPD pushes you to be hyper-aware of people so that you won't make mistakes. That really does end up being a strength.

In a way, you can read minds, except the BPD will push you to misinterpret the information if it's about what they think of you. It's so busy trying to make sure you're safe and it's so anxious about doing everything exactly right that you can't sit back and observe and spot the tiniest details the way you do in other situations. But over time, with treatment, you'll get better at keeping the BPD from interfering, and you'll be able to use your talents there, too."
BPD,fajdago,t1_fai9dfw,1576132647.0,"That doesn't match the information I have, but I'm always open to new sources of information.

BPD is the only diagnosis that specifically mentions self-injury as one of its diagnostic criteria, but that certainly doesn't mean that if there's self-injury, there's BPD. Self-injury also happens in PTSD.

A literature review from 2011 by Lang and Sharma-Patel said:

> Because [self-injury] occurs across a variety of clinical and nonclinical populations, and in association with a wide continuum of emotional and behavioral problems, self-injury is conceptualized not as a behavior that typifies a specific diagnosis but as an associated feature of multiple psychiatric disorders. Disorders that feature self-injury tend to self-destructive tendencies and/or have etiology associated with trauma, including BPD, eating and substance abuse disorders, depression, and anxiety. BPD is the only psychiatric diagnosis that includes self-injury as a diagnostic criteria in the DSM which may arguably inflate statistical relations between self-injury and BPD. Self-injury is more strongly and reliably associated with dissociative [disorders] and PTSD, diagnoses whose criterion include traumatic or stressful experience/experiences as a diagnostic precursor. Although the exact nature of these associations are complex, there are well-established relations between trauma, dissociative symptoms, and self-injury.

PTSD doesn't have that much crossover with BPD unless the trauma in PTSD was interpersonal, repeated, began at a young age, and included a lack of emotional support.

At its core, BPD is about instability in relationships. Someone with BPD has a lifelong experience of not being able to repair relationships that have been disrupted. For some reason, mistakes and conflicts end up being permanent failures. This often involves mistreatment on the part of the parent, but it doesn't have to. It could just be that the parent never could re-connect with their child in a way that felt meaningful to the child. And that could be because the child with BPD can see through superficial attempts to re-connect because they are usually more sensitive than most to the subtleties in relationships.

Theirs is a repeated experience of betrayal, rejection, and unforgivable mistakes. This leads to a furious attempt to fix these problems at all costs, but the attempts fail and lead to further disruptions in relationships. BPD is usually diagnosed in adolescence or young adulthood, but it clearly originates from childhood.

At its core, PTSD is a matter of a person being exposed to at least one distinct event that shattered their sense that the world is predictable and manageable. That's a normal reaction to trauma for anyone, but someone with PTSD never does find a way to fit the traumatic experience into their worldview in a way that re-establishes a sense of safety and predictability. That event doesn't need to be related to human interaction at all. A car accident could cause PTSD. It can also happen at any age, even to those with perfectly ideal upbringings and perfect mental health prior to the trauma.

Where BPD and PTSD start looking similar is when you start talking about CPTSD, which is complex PTSD. CPTSD hasn't made it into the DSM yet, but the researchers who study CPTSD keep trying. CPTSD is what happens when there's a prolonged series of traumatic interpersonal events in an environment where no support available, leading the person to an almost Stockholm Syndrome-like way of coping, where they abandon their identity in the attempt to survive.

The big difference between CPTSD and BPD is that BPD uses the insecure-anxious attachment style while CPTSD leads to the fearful-avoidant attachment style.

That is, the person with BPD still has frantic efforts to connect because there's still a belief that things will be okay if they can finally learn to handle relationships exactly right, so it's crucial to keep trying to get it right.

The person with CPTSD is going to be mostly uninterested in attachments by comparison because they don't have those highs where relationships seem to be perfect and wonderful. To them, relationships are mostly more trouble than they're worth because they've never been someone worth knowing. But loneliness still ultimately pushes them into relationships.

Over to AvPD, that one is characterized by a fear of criticism, which already makes it very similar to BPD because it's entirely about social interactions that always seem to go wrong. The difference there is that AvPD doesn't have the push-pull that BPD has. AvPD doesn't have the idealization/demonization. AvPD doesn't have the same sense that everything would be fine if only they could finally figure out how to be good at relationships.

AvPD isn't really about relationships at all. It's about the fear that other people will see your inadequacies. Those inadequacies don't have to be interrelational.

Meanwhile, the person with BPD going to be primarily worried about interrelational inadequacies. A failure doesn't matter that much if it's not really someone else's business because it's not about whether they are bad at things or did something dumb. It's about whether they can interact with someone without sparking anger or retaliation."
BPD,faj63eo,t3_e96w0s,1576125576.0,"One thing that's very common in BPD is the ability to be a chameleon, where you get a feel for the social situation you're in and have a natural talent for mimicking whatever mode of interaction happens to be getting the most approval. The more you practice, the more you learn to expand on the current theme and add in new, witty details until you're not just mimicking any more -- you're adding something new and delightful.

Since you have a deep craving for approval, being the life of the party feels even more amazing than it would for the average person. It's fabulous and everyone appreciates it.

Sadly, it only lasts an hour or two if you're an introvert, and then you're exhausted. And it ultimately feeds your self-doubt that you can never be liked for who you are... whoever that is. Because any time you get any approval at all, you can't resist slipping into chameleon mode and becoming exactly what the other person is charmed by.

The days when social stuff isn't working are the days when you aren't getting enough input from the social environment to give you a clue on how to act. And especially you're going to feel incapable if you're imagining an interaction in the future because you don't realize how dependent you are on reading the social situation in the moment.

Because you read cues in the moment, you're actually much better at social interaction than you think you are. Once it's happening, you have the extra information you needed. You automatically take on mannerisms that the other person will be receptive to. When you think about it ahead of time, you stress because you don't have all the information you need.

I'd say that this ability to be the life of the party is something that is very common (if not guaranteed) in those people with BPD who are good at reading social situations and who have some practice in putting themselves out there. And it's pretty common for people with BPD to be good at reading social situations because your emotional survival is so reliant on picking up subtle cues and using that to avoid the mistakes that you somehow can never be forgiven for making.

If someone with BPD is good at reading social situations but hasn't developed the ability to socialize well, it's because they haven't had enough practice. The talent is there if they can tolerate the risk of trying new things.

As for that doubt about being liked for who you are, that is actually possible. It's just hard because you'll only be able to do that with people you trust, and it's ridiculously hard to build trust. The good part of that is, it doesn't have to be absolute trust. It just has to be trust that it's okay to make mistakes. Then it'll finally be safe enough to show yourself instead of constantly putting your best foot forward."
BPD,faj2vbj,t1_faj22bp,1576122942.0,"Also, it's completely normal for people with BPD to mimic things. That terrified part of you is constantly hunting for a plan on how to act so that people will stop getting upset with you. The quickest answer to that is usually to mimic whatever you see. Your tendency to mimic the BPD behaviors you read about will vanish the next time you see someone getting positive attention, because you'll be drawn to mimic that person instead.

That mimicry is actually from an inner strength. The strength is your willingness to do absolutely anything to make your world safe and loving. Which ends up creating a really strong commitment to your primary relationship. My husband has BPD. We've been together five years. This really is an amazing and wonderful trait in a relationship.

Sure, things are bumpy when you're first diagnosed because you aren't going to have a good plan for making things good in relationships. And right now, you may be stuck leapfrogging from primary relationship to primary relationship.

But the desire is there, and that's really valuable. People with BPD have so many great things to offer once you figure out how to balance the urge to race toward safety and love with the need to make decisions that are going to work out long-term."
BPD,faj22bp,t3_e9ekvq,1576122321.0,"When you have BPD, there is a terrified, bitterly lonely, rejected part of you that is also extremely strong and able to overwhelm you at times to make sure that you do what it wants you to do. It wants safety and love, but it doesn't always have good plans for how to get there. Treatment will teach you how to have a balance so that you can make decisions independently from that part while doing things to help that part.

Until then, here's the deal. Maybe, after you've known this new person for two years, they'll still be better at giving support than your current partner is. Or maybe it's something that sparks bright and fizzes out in three months. There's no way to know from here. So that part of you that craves safety and love is going to go toward whichever one makes you feel safest and most loved today.

By shutting out your partner, you've already made a decision. You're stringing your partner along, hoping that he'll still be available if this new person fizzes out. It's unkind to expect that of someone if you're not doing your part to maintain the relationship.

It doesn't have to be that way. Having BPD doesn't mean that you can only give your love and devotion to one person. But it's tempting. Because that part that wants love and safety would rather go all-in on the new person that's currently giving you more good stuff. It doesn't want to have the emotional risk of actively maintaining two relationships.

If you're at a place emotionally where you can devote energy to two people at once, great. That is, if you truly still do delight in times with your partner and you can stop being cold to him, you're probably fine. Otherwise, you're going to have to accept that until you get some treatment under your belt, you're going to be hopping from person to person, abandoning your current friends and partners to chase the latest one who seems to be everything you ever wanted.

It's okay to be at that place. It really is. It's okay if your relationship patterns are dysfunctional on day one. But if they are, consider letting your partner know that you're not capable of attending to two people at once, and you can't pull yourself away from this new match, so you have to be honest and let him go."

DBT has good things to offer, but ultimately what I think it does is turn an average person with BPD into a person with discouraged/quiet BPD, though with some better coping tools. That's enough to quiet enough symptoms to make someone fall below the diagnostic criteria, but it doesn't fix the agony that is living with this emotional brutality.

And personally, I find it very useful to know that this article exists. I imagine this isn't the last time that I'll refer to it as an example of the stigma that exists within the medical profession. It's very useful... for reasons quite different than the authors thought."
Borderline,fafrmk7,t3_e8xi0q,1576030148.0,"First, thank you for posting this. Anything discussing chronic pain and BPD is important and interesting.

Second, this paper is beyond disappointing. It's a glorified opinion piece, and I'm a truly horrified that it was published in a peer-reviewed journal. Overall, the only thing of use this paper offers is the observation that BPD is probably uncommonly likely to be found in patients with chronic pain.

What does that mean? Who knows. The authors certainly don't give anything but opinion about how one shouldn't trust people with BPD as much as they trust patients without BPD, based on the usual stereotypical, hateful garbage about people with BPD overreacting and manipulating others.

One of the two pieces of actual research-based findings is:

> While empirical data are scant, one area of study is the prevalence of BPD among patients with chronic pain. We examined a sample of primary care outpatients with chronic pain and found that 50 percent of participants met the diagnostic criteria for BPD using a semistructured interview for diagnosis. Merceron, Rossel, and Matthey also confirmed BPD features among chronic pain patients through the use of projective psychological testing.

Fifty percent of chronic pain patients scored high on a questionnaire that screens for BPD. (Notice, it's scoring high on a questionnaire. They didn't actually check to see if those people have BPD. They didn't comment on whether scoring high on any of the items on the questionnaire are explainable simply by chronic pain.)

But it's an interesting finding. It prompts plenty of questions. One of those questions is whether BPD causes chronic pain. And there's no data that offers any insight on that question, either. They don't even bother to tell us what percentage of people with BPD have chronic pain or tell us how that compares to the general population.

They don't tell us anything about whether chronic pain is reported differently for those with BPD compared to those without. There's no information whatsoever on differences between those two populations.

Here's the other actual research-based finding:

> A second area of research is the prevalence of opioid misuse among those suffering from BPD. Opioid misuse, or the excessive use of narcotic analgesics by borderline patients, might be a practical indicator of pain intolerance. While few in number, several studies specifically confirm the existence of opioid abuse in a substantial minority of patients with BPD. In this regard, Dulit and colleagues found that 15 percent of patients with BPD had histories of opioid abuse or dependence. In a Greek study of young adult inpatients with BPD, Hatzitaskos and colleagues found that five percent acknowledged opioid misuse. Frankenburg and Zanarini compared BPD patients in symptom remission to those with continuing symptoms and found that the more symptomatic subsample reported the sustained use of pain medications. Finally, Kaplan and Korelitz found an association between BPD and oral narcotic use among patients with inflammatory bowel disease. These empirical data support the clinical observations that some patients with BPD are unable to tolerate ongoing pain and subsequently overutilize pain medications, including opioid analgesics.

No, no they don't. They don't support the observations that some patients with BPD are unable to tolerate ongoing pain. They tell us that people with BPD are prone to opioid addiction. (Though how much more than the general population? This paper doesn't tell us.)

And since substance abuse is in the criteria for BPD, this isn't ground-breaking stuff. They didn't give us any information that lets us sort out whether that abuse is likely to be because of a lack of tolerance of physical pain, or whether it's just because people with BPD are prone to substance abuse and opioids are great for soothing emotions.

And the rest of the article is an argument that people with BPD probably overreport pain (do you have any data on that? No, you're relying only on the fact that the DSM says that people with BPD have difficulty with self-regulation) or are likely to be using pain as an excuse to solicit help (any data to support that? No, I didn't think so).

Just. Plain. Infuriating. You guys deserve better from the medical profession."
