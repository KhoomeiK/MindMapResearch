nursing,fr1oou8,t1_fr0asuq,1589823357.0,"Hi thank you so much for your reply! The company is DaVita, any thoughts on that? It‚Äôs gonna be a chronic setting. I‚Äôm very excited for a change. I just started my nursing career and have only done LTC for about 5 months. I‚Äôm still unsure of what I want to do but I‚Äôm willing to try new things. May I ask what your hours were like? Was it financially a good decision? Which did you like more Acute or chronic?"

PassNclex,ffy5bce,t1_ffxdstv,1580338832.0,"Exactly what you said. I finished with 75 in under an hour just using uworld. Most people that use uworld the correct way pass. And by correct I mean actually understanding why the answer is correct and why it wasn‚Äôt answers B C or D. You gotta make notes and flash cards and they make it very simple for you to do so right on their website. As long as you dedicate time and effort, uworld should be more than enough. Plus it‚Äôs not extremely expensive like Kaplan for example."

AskReddit,f1oigyg,t3_da0wc1,1569646867.0,"Very early in the morning I walk into work and I make myself a cup of coffee. I take a sip and rush to the garbage can to spit it out. The taste was awful. I go back into the office to make myself another cup then head to the kitchen to get stuff done.. take another sip and boom same disgusting taste. Now this time I walk back mad as hell checking the keurig, checking expiration dates and nothing. I go right ahead and make myself a THIRD cup of coffee after finding nothing. I start to prepare it and then I suddenly snap out it of. I caught myself walking over to the BIG container of salt that we kept for salting fries. I had been pouring salt into my coffee."

AskReddit,es9rwg7,t1_es8ch4b,1561743118.0,"This reminds me of the time I trained a kid that came from a wealthy family. He did NOT want to be there. He would literally speak to no one. Only reason he got a job was because the owner was friends with his family. He would never pick up his checks and would just let them accumulate. We would remind him to take them home after his shifts and he‚Äôd always say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need them‚Äù. It came to a point where our boss took them and personally handed it to the kid‚Äôs mom. He didn‚Äôt last that long but he did last longer than I expected. Apparently, he got a job in the first place because his mom wanted him to interact with people and quit the video games."
