I've been thinking about it from your viewpoint and realising maybe Te is the thing that pushes me to understand people more. Because for years I've been looking at the human mind as a system. When people go through shit and I help them through it, it doesn't come from a place of ""let me help you because I care about you"", it's more a case of ""let me help you because I want to fix your broken life and your broken mind - there's been some damage done, now let me help you undo it so it can go back to being a functional system"".

When people look at me and see someone who's nurturing, it's probably because I pay attention to them because I want to fix them. But I don't want to fix them in a saviour complex sort of way - I want to fix them because I don't see any point in them living an unnecessarily complicated life when it could be easier and more straightforward."

AskReddit,fndk6xb,t3_g13oha,1586871867.0,"**TL;DR Left first world London for the third world. Where I suffer a lot of trauma and four diagnosed mental illnesses (bipolar, BPD, PTSD and bulimia), three weeks away from toxic first world pressures did more healing than anything else I've ever experienced. I learned to be alone and have a good relationship with myself - that was probably the greatest takeaway.**

I never knew what ""finding yourself"" meant until I unexpectedly ended up doing it.

I was dealing with years and years of trauma (sexual assault, rape, emotional abuse, 20 years of bullying over my weight, 3 years of being stalked by a sex trafficker, etc.) finally catching up to me. All the shit memories were just laid bare on the forefront of my mind and I had no coping mechanisms.

I've also had a lot issues with my identity/character/personality. Part of that is probably the mental illnesses I was diagnosed with it. But whatever it is, I generally struggled A LOT because I had no sense of self, no purpose. I didn't know who I was or who I'm meant to be. Who do I look up to? Who do I *not* want to be?

My life had been characterised by friendships that fucked me up as they always turned out to be bullies; relationships which totally screwed me over because I'd either get raped, emotionally abused, or manipulated into being trafficked. My own family rejected me in favour of my cousin who molested me when I was a child, this happened *after* finding out about it all. I've always been alone, but to combat that from the age of 18 I threw myself into any relationship that would take me. If I couldn't get into a relationship I would rely on my clients through sex work.

I made sure I was never alone because I didn't know how to be alone.

At my lowest I'd just gone through a harsh breakup after what was easily my worst experience of a relationship - and that's saying something. It was a lot of emotional abuse and a lot of neglect from someone pulling me in and then pushing me away - sometimes both within the same conversation. To put it in perspective - I dealt with anal rape in a past relationship better than I ever dealt with this.

Along with the breakup I was also facing unemployment and I wasn't able to get back into sex work so I was dealing with being properly alone for the first time in my life. In the past there was always a distraction, but for the first time ever, I had no one.

My parents decided one day to go back to our home country (third world) and I figured I'd tag along. I wasn't getting along with my siblings and needed a break from them. And my parents always spoiled me as a kid but became incredibly neglectful after I was about 12 years old as they prioritised work - we lived together, but as they had businesses to deal with, I barely saw them for 20 minutes a week. I thought this was my chance to spend so much time with them and get real attention from them for the first time after 14 years of nothing. 

When the time came to go back to our home country I was in full freak out mode. It was one thing being without friends/relationships/work at home, but I was now facing being without friends/relationships/work and my siblings. Although we were having issues, we have always had a strong bond mainly because regardless of how they treat me, I give in and go back to them every time. But this time was the first time in my life I would be without them. I think I was 24 years old at the time so in my 24 years of being on this planet I had never ever been without at least one sibling. I had a stronger bond with them than I did with my parents. Like, no matter how many friends I lost, how many break ups I had, how many issues I had with sex work, how times I was raped or emotionally abused (usually by a boyfriend), or how many jobs I left, my siblings were *always* there. They weren't comforting at all and were incredibly invalidating, but they were consistently around me, so being without them was huge. I obviously had to get over it because the tickets were expensive lol and I knew I needed to leave them and learn who I am without them.

When the time came I spent most of the 16 hour flight crying. The first night was horrific as it hit me that I'm completely alone when I saw a cockroach and couldn't do anything or call anyone for help because my mum and dad were asleep. I'm highly arachnophobic. I started shaking and sobbed from fear as I fell asleep.

In a normal 24 hour day over there, I'd spend about 7-8 hours sleeping, 3-10 hours with my parents, and the rest of the time I was alone in my room watching Game of Thrones or going on Reddit. I had all the time in the world to reflect.

We'd spend a lot of time in villages, markets, hours of driving around as they sorted out their business. I was just there for the ride the entire time. I knew going in it wouldn't be one of those relaxing holidays as they had a lot to do. The entire time I was there I was cut off from everyone and everything I knew. I was a fish out of water - a first world city girl suddenly stuck in unknown territory where I could barely speak the language (my mother tongue) and had absolutely no one to tell me who to be, how to act, what to think. My identity up until this point relied on my various boyfriends telling me who to be, my siblings telling me how to act, society telling me what tom think.

The more time I spent in my thoughts here in the third world away from all the first world agencies trying damn hard to influence every step we take, the more I started learning how to think clearly. There was no one telling me I'm not good enough, no one telling me that being unemployed is a bad thing, no one calling me ""uneducated"" and saying the only job that I'm capable of doing is something dead end like retail, no pressure to do things that I wasn't mentally capable of doing at the time (e.g. getting an education, learning to drive, getting an amazing career without a university degree), no pressure to look thin, eat healthy 24/7, and wear clothes that cost way too much money.

I realised that in the first world we're so often *severely* pressurised to fit inside this box that's created for us by the 1001 agencies influencing us telling us that the decisions we make aren't good enough as they are and that we need to be like this, look like that, have this degree from this university, have that job from that reputable organisation/company. You need to drive, you need to buy your own house, you need to find love and get married, you need to wear your makeup like that, you need to be skinny like this, never mind don't worry about being skinny because now you need to be fat to fit in, but we're not going to call it fat - we're going to call it ""curvy"", only you're not allowed to be called that unless your curves are in the right places and you have the flattest stomach and smallest waist whilst still having a huge ass and thighs - all of which cannot be achieved without surgery or immense strength training. FUCK. I didn't realise I was this stressed.

As someone with 4 diagnosed mental illnesses (bipolar, bpd, PTSD and bulimia) I've struggled A LOT with trying to keep up with the demands of the first world society. I couldn't figure who *I am* because I've been trying absolutely fucking hard trying to be who society tells me to be.

Being away from ALL of those pressures and living a life where I was in the moment all the time, being forced to finally think for myself and be who I wanted/needed to be was uncharted territory for me. I never learned to be independent and fully self sufficient until this experience.

It's funny because when I left the UK to go there I was sobbing because I didn't want to leave the life I knew and didn't want to be alone. But when I left my native country, I was sobbing because I loved the freedom and the peace I had there - even though it was the third world!

After coming back to the UK, within two weeks I got a job, within three months I passed my driving test and got a car that week. Within 8 months I got into a top 10 university in the UK. I reported the ex who I suspected of sex trafficking to the police. He tried contacting me again but for the first time in 6 years I had the balls to tell him to get the fuck away from me. I'm now looking to buy my first house in London within the next few years.

It has now been 15 months since the experience and I no longer depend on my siblings (unless my tyres are flat hehe) and I haven't been in one relationship. My addiction to co-dependence is dead as I finally learned to be alone. And I think I enjoy it too much because I can now go about 16 hours without needing to speak to anyone. The loneliness still gets to me because I miss feeling romantic fulfillment, but other than that, I've learned to be me."

When getting to know him he told me he helped ""build"" the BBC in the 70, 80s and 90s and still works with them occasionally. I didn't know what that meant so I brushed it off.

At the end of our meeting he asked me that next time he wants me to ""bring along a little friend"" - someone who's ""petite and looks younger than 16"" like I apparently did. He said that he'd help me out if I helped him.

Again, I didn't think anything of it until years later. I was studying paedophile rings in the UK when I was in university and started connecting the dots.

I was 18 years old and incredibly naive when I first started in the field. If I knew then what I know now I know I definitely would have probed more, investigated, probably gotten myself into some shit trying to figure out as much as I can, and then reported it all to the police.

UKParenting,fn4y1mo,t3_fzargp,1586651481.0,">His version of helping leaves me in a worse state than when I started

He doesn't need to help you the way an adult does. Just give him a towel, a sponge (dry or wet - up to you), a broom/dustpan and brush, etc. and he'll occupy himself while you get on with things. If he pesters you while you're cleaning, it'll take a little bit of time for him to get used to being just a little more independent but soon enough he'll learn.

I live with a 23 month old, 24 month old, a 3 year old and take care of a 5 year old and 7 year old. None are mine, but I'm usually responsible for them - especially now as my job is the only one I can't do from home so I have time. When I clean, I expect them to make a mess while I'm cleaning but it's calm because it just means I'll need a bit of extra time. Usually when I'm sweeping the floor I give all of them a broom/dustpan/brush each and tell them to help me. They just start playing or attempting to help and don't actually do anything. While they occupy themselves I keep an eye on them and get on with my cleaning.

It gets easier as you get into the rhythm of things and he learns to ""play"" or keep himself occupied with non-toys like the cleaning things I mentioned above."

The long story:

We associate anthropomorphic qualities to understand the concept better. And we've done that so much that we've dumbed down the concept of this almighty, omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent essence into a sky dad who'll send you to the naughty corner of you break these man-made rules humanity has created and stamped his name on them.

I think we've done that to comprehend what we don't know. Because in the past humans were overly simplistic. The way we think, we need to humanise everything and relate it back to us to *really* grasp the idea of it. I suppose in developmental psychological terms, the idea of egocentrism could potentially explain this.

Regardless, when you take away everything time, all mainstream holy scriptures and the ghost stories have taught us about what the mainstream know as ""god"" away, we have no idea what the hell (pun not intended) it really is.

Is it the essence that ignited the big bang? Is it time itself? Is it energy?

Whatever it is, I highly doubt it's the old white bearded dude in the sky (or Morgan Freeman) because that's the most fathomable idea humanity could create of him/it/whatever. And the fact that we had to develop this specific idea (that he's just another human with unlimited super powers) shows that we cannot comprehend the idea of *it*."

>I think a lot of people that don't know how to make small talk are just super literal people, very concrete thinking. If you say that a store is a million miles away, they will say, ""No, I drove there the other day and it is 1.5 miles away."" I notice this on reddit *all. the. time.*  They don't understand metaphors and allegories and most literary devices. And especially they don't understand humor. 

This is me at an extreme. I'm either extremely metaphorical or I'm extremely literal. I'll be the person who converses using facts. Then 5 minutes later I'll be exaggerating to describe something.

I'm not bad looking at all. For what it's worth, I'm a ""retired"" (I'm in my mid 20s) sex worker and have been offered good deals to get into porn purely based on my natural looks. I'm often told I'm highly attractive and my friends/ex boyfriends would get incredibly jealous when walking down the street with me because I get a lot of attention from people gawking at me. But none of that means anything because it's near impossible for me to get into a meaningful relationship, or any relationship for that matter.

I'm currently 15lbs bigger than I used to be and that's what makes me feel fat. I'm by no means above average, if anything I'm still smaller than average even with the weight gain. But it's the looking in the mirror and no longer seeing the cheekbones and noticing my waist and hips are a dress size  offer. I think I put pressure on my weight because I blame my loneliness and inability to get into a relationship on that."

AskReddit,fn3do0f,t3_fz6655,1586618584.0,"My first ever client when I started working as a sex worker several years ago.

I was 18, he was decades older.

I had no idea what to expect because before this, the only person I had ever had sex with was my first boyfriend - he was 18, 6'4, genetically gifted as he had the jawline and abs of a Greek demigod, and a huge... You get the idea.

I undressed and was waiting on the bed while the client was in the bathroom getting ready. I figured I'd take a peek as I could just about see him naked in the mirror and wanted to know what to expect. I looked through the space of the door and all I remember was his protruding stomach fat hanging around his equally large buttcheeks.

The shock took over and words escaped me. 

I got on with the job, but I was SO exposed to this world at that point that instead of building up to the foreplay and doing all the sexy stuff I had been training myself to do for the first day on the job, I just started sucking his dick straightaway. No build up, no suspense, no sexy talk or anything of the sort. His pubes were so long that they kept escaping into my mouth so while licking his penis I had to shimmy my tongue side to side to try and wipe the stray pubes off."

AskReddit,fn2xicr,t3_fz2oeu,1586606880.0,"**TL;DR Fucked a colleague in my office at work who my cousin had a crush on when were all working the same shift. I was their manager. She was front line dealing with the service users when it happened - and it happened more than once. I resented her for being the thinner, smarter, more popular one when we were kids so this was my chance to finally have something that she wanted.**

My cousin and I used to work together. I've resented her for 20 years because she had an amazing childhood while I was neglected and sexually abused by another cousin of ours; she was thin while I was overweight and bullied for it; she had friends while mine became my bullies; everyone loved her. Regardless, we've always been really close.

Some years ago, I knew she was struggling being NEET so I gave her a job in my work place. Eventually she started developing feelings for our colleague who was absolutely fucking hot, charming and had a wicked sense of humour. If I wasn't his manager and didn't think he sucked at his job, I would've developed feelings for him too.

Now, he and I were very good friends and had an incredible connection. We got along great, had amazing conversations about life and relationships because we both struggled to find someone who was more than just a FWB.

One day he brought up the idea of us being together. I'm the biggest romantic who falls in love with any guy who simply smiles at me, yet I never imagined being with him because he was always a disappointment as my employee - also he's a very typical ""fuckboy"" while I wanted a boyfriend/stable relationship. I laughed it off, but slowly started warming up to the idea over the coming days.

During a busy shift when they were both working front line, I had a lot of paper work to do and was stuck in my office. He came into the office while I was in the deep end and asked if I needed help - I said no, he's more useful out there. So he put his hand on my shoulder and started rubbing it saying I look stressed and I should let him help. Being the totally ignorant person I am who just can't tell when someone is flirting with me, I brushed it off and said no again.

He left.

10 minutes later he came back and did the same thing, this time with more touching. I said no again. Again, I didn't see this as him coming onto me because my head was in work mode.

Next time he came in, he closed the door behind him and started doing it again, only this time he was little more forceful. I finally connected the dots and realised what was happening. Now my choices were either do it or don't. As someone who gets off on doing risky shit like this, my head had already decided ""let's go for this shit!"" so I let him carry on.

Soon enough, his hands went down to my chest, then into my pants. Things got hotter and more naked as simple touching turned into full on foreplay. Suddenly we were on my office floor, pants off, and going at it full force.

When he was done we put our clothes back on, he went back to the front and I carried on with my paperwork. None of us work there anymore so we see each other less, but still she has no idea. And to this day, almost 3 years later, he and I still get together occasionally."

I live in a busy house with a lot of family - half of who aren't my immediate family. I don't leave my room for most of the day."
