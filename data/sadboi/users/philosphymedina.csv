schizophrenia,fkvza1c,t1_fkvxrma,1584579929.0,"Thats that then , i guess ill just lay off the weed for right now. Really similar experience , smoked at age 12 didn’t like. Then at age 14 i smoked again and since then I’ve smoked everyday, obviously took my breaks or there where moments where I didn’t have any and went with out smoking for a few. At age 16 I started taking lsd , took several tabs before i had my “ breakthrough “ which fucked me up for a while . It really fucked me up because my intention wasn’t to breakthrough actually I didn’t have any idea that lsd was spiritual/metaphysical , i took it as just getting absurdly high so it hit me like a train !! 
Took me about a week to come back to my normal state of mind ."
