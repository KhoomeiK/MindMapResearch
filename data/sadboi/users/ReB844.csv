Punk rock was not popular in the early 90s, grunge took all the room. But I really loved their early stuff, when they were absolutely unknown. Then they gained in popularity. Punk rock became part of the mainstream and was very influential. I just think it was awesome to find some of their song in the top 40s and influence so many other artist. Should I stop listening to an artist because he suddently made the top 40? The artists reaching the top 40s now are mostly rappers or hip hop.

When the genres of music you like are blooming, it is an awesome time. So many bands, so much choice.

- my close friend committed suicide at 16 yo because his then girlfriend left him. I was heartbroken. His mom killed herself a couple months after. This was devastating. Thinking about it 20 years after, i think he was suffering so much emotionally that he ended his life, but I’m sure he regrets it. When time passes we often realize we were so focused on our problems that we cannot see anything else and all the positive things around us.

- meds are personally helping me. Took forever to find the right combination, but now I’m happy I persevered.

- religion...raised in a catholic family, let’s just say at the time god was not portrayed as loving, but more like “Big brother is watching”. I was actually scared of god. The priest would abuse their powers often with the poorest families, and would abuse kids... now I’m atheist, I don’t know what’s after life but I won’t give any moral power or authority to a church that will inevitably abuse of it.

- try to focus on things that go towards your core values. Find a way to express those emotions. Your art is probably a good way. For me it’s playing music...and I’m not even good at it, but man is it therapeutic.

- last thing which I find the hardest, try to be in the present moment sometimes. I spend the vast majority of my time in catastrophic scenarios, fears, anxious thoughts, that I completely forget that it is nice outside, I have music on and I’m cooking a nice meal on the bbq. I can take a shower and not remember that I have take one because I was so deep in my thoughts. Rarely anything good comes out of those thoughts, and they are what they are, just thoughts."

From what I heard almost nobody took the offer. I don’t see people lining up at the recruiting centres... I don’t think in the current economical situation that the CF is a competitive offer compared to the private. It can drastically change with the exonomy, but at the moment, attrition is significant"
CanadianForces,f44lv81,t1_f43ljsf,1571354823.0,"The new healthy way for me looks like this: Most trades are drastically short staff, with many members on medical limitations so always the same people are operational. You get deployed/sail all the time, you move every 3-4 years (not counting the countless ATP),  then your family seems to be stable somewhere so you don't want to move them, you decide to go on IR (which doesn't have the same benefits that before), your relationship starts to fail, you feel you have to pick between your career and your family, you start having depression, you end up on a TCat/PCat. You burn out and they move to the next person that is ""fit"". You do not have the old camaraderie we had because we ""leave work at work"", you're on IR in an apartment or deployed for the 3rd time in 5 years, you're watching your mariage fail. But yes we're encouraged to have work/life balance, to go to the gym, etc. And we're wondering why people are releasing.

So the ""leave work at work"" can be applied in those rare postings (depending what trade you're in I guess) where you're not required to go on operations, that you don't have to stay after work to fix something/finish something because your regiment goes on exercise the next day/your ship sails for a couple weeks. 

For some of the trades drastically short, they offered everybody that released in the past 5 or 10 years a 20,000$ bonus to come back in, and you were guaranteed your old rank. So a couple hundred of people got offered this, from what I heard almost nobody took it. Why is that happening if the grass is not greener on the other side? They should be lining up at the recruiting center doors..."
CanadianForces,f43jldv,t1_f40odnu,1571342448.0,"IThis is your opinion, but the fact show otherwize. Countless people recently released because they prefered the old way. They were not happy with the trade amalgamations, the lack of cohesion and sense of community, being constantly overworked and getting nothing in return, being imposed unrealistic expectations, etc. I conducted dozens of release interviews, not everybody thinks it changed for the best. It wasn’t all about drinking, I used that as one of the example that affected people. I have long list of reasons I collected from those release interviews.

I remember a town hall, the senior officer and NCO said:”the people releasing will find the grass is not always greener on the other side”. Somebody answered:”Sir, I worked for General Electric for 6 years before joining, and I’m going back to work for GE. I never thought it would have been better in the provate sector, but it was.” Thing was followed by an ackward silence.

So if you enjoy it better now than 15-20 years ago, this is great for you. I was just saying that not everybody has the same opinion and the vast amount of releases and the low recruitment numbers show that. Unhappy people leave, happy people stay. The new generation that won’t know the old CF won’t have anything to compare with and the change will be completed then. We’re just having a hard time recruiting at the monent..."
CanadianForces,f3zpv9h,t3_divkf5,1571274192.0," It was true at a certain time, more than 10 years ago, it was very different, it definitely was a lifestyle, a family. Things have completely changed (some argue it was for the best, others says it was for the worst). There is less cohesion, less dedication, less pride in my opinion, but there is more emphasis on work life balance, more acceptance of differences, etc.

Soon enough “senior members” like me that knew the “old CF” will be gone, since we’ve lost our landmarks, and we don’t really fit in anymore. You soon will not hear that type of comments anymore. 

Just to give you an idea, at the time, drinking was a way to socialize and fit in. Drinking was part of the culture and was well accepted, now we consider this outside of the organizational values. We would devote our lives to our units, mentoring the younger ones, helping where needed, you devoted everything to the CF. You spent more time with your mates bonding, they were part of your family. But we had little work life balance. If you didn’t fit in, it was very hard to continue and be accepted. It was a different time, a different approach, some found it better and some worst, the CF took a different direction and not everybody accepted it. 

It might have played a role into the attrition issues we’re facing now, the senior people have lost that sense of lifestyle/family, the younger generation do not feel the same loyalty and devotion to an organization, want work life balance and overall want a job and not a lifestyle."
PTSDCombat,f3n70zi,t1_f3jry07,1570995373.0,"If he doesn’t want to help himself, there is not much you can do to be honest. I was stuck in the same downward spiral for a while, I was drinking way too much and didn’t really want to live, the drinking was numbing the emotions and feeling that I was destroying myself which is what I wanted for some reason. Before totally ruining my life, I gave therapy and meds a chance...and managed to get myself somewhat under control. I’m not out of the woods, and will probably never be, but I’m back doing physical exercise (I gained a lot of weight), playing music, and having a general interest for live. And I manage to remain sober for long periods and trying to drink reasonably when I do. It took a while and quite a lot of meds until I found a good combination. So it is possible to get back on track.

Last thing I wanted to mention, my wife also hated my drinking habit. I would drink in the evenings and would regularly (almost daily) get drunk before going to bed. The drinking was the only thing my wife could see, and she focused on it. It’s the only thing she would talk about. So I decided to stop drinking, cold, no meds and no support. I became completely disfunctional, had nightmares all the time, I had so many anxiety crisises that I couldn’t drive or do basic stuff. I really became a mess, drinking wasn’t the root cause of my issues, it was just something I used to get a break from all that anxiety. I was able to get rid of my alcohol addiction when I realized I had to deal with the root cause, my anxiety caused by previous events I decided to repress.

That made me quite depressed, the doc gave me viagra which for a 34YO male, was even more insulting, no way I would take those. So I stopped my happy pills, got into a withdrawal, things were even worst. So we switched meds 3-4 times, and tried meds combinations (more than one molecule), which I am on right now. Boner is back (nice to see him after a while), and I’m overall less distant and more involved. Meds should improve your life, not make it worst."
PTSDCombat,f3a54u1,t3_dg87ou,1570761959.0,"Unfortunately PTSD is a complex thing and is managed differently by people suffering from it. My wife has been very supportive, but the worst for me is to feel that my condition is making her cry. I want her to be happy, no matter what, even of that means I cannot be in her life anymore. Cause she has the right to be happy. I started drinking too much, to be distant, work too much, feel that life is not worth living...and I’m the dad of a 1 YO baby girl. I constantly felt like shit for who I became and how I thought I wasn’t being the husband and dad I should be.

I managed somehow to talk about what I was going through, and I accepted help. I was ready to do that however, I had enough of my depression and shitty drinking lifestyle. I was tired of feeling like this and having a negative impact on everybody. I’m now seeing a psychologist, an addiction’s counsellor, and my doctor. I started meds, took a while to find the right ones, but I see light at the end of the tunnel. I’m not out of the woods yet, but I put myself through a daily routine: go for a walk with my wife and the baby, wake up with the baby and feed her breakfast, get her in the bath and to sleep at night, that is grounding me.

The nightmares and anxiety haven’t went away but through time (and probably the meds) it goes down. Then my sex drive started to go up. I was dealing with so much through so many months and I was so depressed that sex was the last thing I thought about.

So I cannot tell you how to manage this since we all have different sotries and relationships. In my case, I couldn’t live like this anymore, either I was ending my life, I was asking for help, or I was going back to that unsane environment that will keep my insane mind going (military/war environment). I chose to ask for help, but I will never judge somebody that makes a different choice. I have a very suppotive wife which played a big role. And I will never judge a partner that cannot take this situation anymore. PTSD is a complex condition/disease, nothing about it is easy. I wish I could guide you better but you may have to ask questions that the answer is important to you, let him know how you feel and how this is impacting you, deal with challenging situations and make difficult decisions. My wife and I managed to get through it (again, I’ll never be cured but I’m better) and I am so happy to be a father."
