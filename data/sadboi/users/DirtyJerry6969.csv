Gib was never good, I respect him for getting in a ring and training with the heart of a spartan. But, I never believed he was going to win. Jake did not prove himself yet. KSI beat Logan Paul,  without even using his game plan to win, Viddal and others said he used about 25% of it. In the media workout, we saw a KSI with speed, precision, technique, and power.He did not use them, but possesses them. He won't need windmills to beat Jake, since there is no reach and significant reach advantage. KSI also has experience advantage.

I go to a top private high school in Canada where the curriculum is very fast paced, therefore we need to practice (exercises etc) and study a lot. For me, homework has taught me time management, working hard and efficiently, motivation and a reason to be invested. Thus I am more prepared to go to a top university and succeed greatly then if I did not get any homework at school since all the qualities listed above would not be taught to me through personal experience. This is just my take on it, but some intersesting points were given."
