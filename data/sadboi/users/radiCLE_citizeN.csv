lonely,fl93jvv,t3_fn6a9r,1584939870.0,"Not much has changed for me. Single M, 32, longest relationship (too many) lasted less than 2 years. Yeah, it’s a me problem. Too much apathy. I’d rather play golf and hang out with my dog. Yeah he’s dope AF so why complicate things with a long term commitment to another human besides my own family?"
chronotrigger,fkk2w2f,t3_fioh3k,1584271263.0,"Back in grade school I would rent SNES games from the Giant Eagle video section if I was well behaved enough to earn it. You could only rent for 1 or 2 nights. One evening after I stayed home from school sick, my dad rented this game on his way home from work. He picked it pretty much at random. I was instantly hooked. Having to return it and pray no one would save over my file was something out of a nightmare. A few years later the video section phased out and they sold off most of their videos and games. We managed to snag Lufia II and Final Fantasy III, each for probably $5-10. But damn, someone else swooped in and bought CT before we could. So for my 13th birthday my parents took me to Funcoland (since bought out by GameStop) and bought me a used CT cartridge for $70. This was in 2001. This game will hold its value forever. Replay value still through the roof even after achieving every ending. I named my dog Crono."
chronotrigger,fkfg6y2,t3_fi1uj3,1584133689.0,Nice! I got a used cartridge by itself about 20 years ago for $70. Still has the previous owner’s name scribbled in sharpie on the back! Still boots right up beautifully.
unpopularopinion,fivq83p,t3_f9y7e9,1582765627.0,"I work as an in-home sales rep for a home improvement product, on straight commission and do lots of driving to company leads. I’m spending most of my days up to 300 miles on the road, in 2-3 homes, 5-6 days a week. A lot of days wipe me out pretty good. I just wanna chill with my dog and relax, spend some time with my family or play some golf. 

The company wants their reps to be constantly following up with customers and hitting them up for referrals and social media tags, and obviously making a bit more money doing so. That’s all great and some people are certainly cut out for it, but I just am not about that lifestyle. It’s my job, which is cool. I’ll certainly chat with people about it, but you will not catch me in your neighborhood knocking on doors. It’s fine, because it pays the bills, I can save a good bit and have health coverage. I don’t need a lot. I’ll enjoy a small vacation here and there. Family, hobbies leisure time will always mean more to me in life than getting rich."

solar,f48lgcy,t3_djuq7q,1571442020.0,Great deal. If there is no early payoff or pay down penalty through your financing bank you’ll be fine with a 20 yr. You’ll only need the full 20 if you don’t pay any extra towards principal at all.
Browns,f3x0wj8,t3_diirnd,1571229041.0,Great post. I think a lot of teams are coached up to act super hard out there because there is no penalty for flopping. And sometimes it fools the refs into believing something is there when it’s not.

depression,ezwfqnt,t3_d2li0t,1568215637.0,"I can relate pretty closely to this...sometimes find myself comparing my lonely existence to others. I’ve been avoiding Facebook because all it does is make me jealous of all the lives that my high school and college friends are living. Still between jobs and unmotivated to continue employment. Trying to find a purpose in living but coming up empty more often than not. But my unconditionally loving dog is helping me keep my chin up and at least wake up and do some things each day. Sometimes it feels like laying in bed all day would accomplish just as much, but at 31, I remind myself that there is still time to turn things around and embrace my individuality! Here’s to wanting to live YOUR life how YOU want. Cheers. Hope everything gets better!"
depression,eyqfrwy,t3_cy0nam,1567341406.0,"Same exact age as you, recently dumped after thinking I was finally in a relationship that would last. All just a couple months after my ex and I moved in together. Now we are just awkward roommates. I haven’t made any close friends since high school. No one ever hits me up to do anything, been on the job hunt for 2 months and haven’t found a career to be passionate about. I’m right there with you."
depression,eydie67,t3_cwl19g,1567019172.0,"I hit a stint several years back that was like whenever I’d drive somewhere, I’d just think about blowing directly thru sharp turns and plummeting down huge hillsides or into massive trees and meeting instant death. Not so much red lights as other innocent folks could be hurt or killed, but I figured it would be the easiest “accident”. I understand the feeling."
n64,etopz3g,t3_ccksr5,1563034524.0,I remember exactly when my buddy and I achieved the 120th star. Hundredth coin in the clock tower...those dang red coins man. Wall jumping a gazillion attempts and stuff. Unreal times.
