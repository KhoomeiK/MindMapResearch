lonely,fkhxy20,t3_fiei0x,1584208062.0,"As a girl, I feel the same way. Although there is still hope within me there are very dark moments these, days. Sending you hungs and strength!"
ForeverAloneDating,fkfoga7,t1_fkfny9w,1584138981.0,I don't know maybe it's just because your message has a very condescending tone and I really can't stand when people who don't know me make assumptions about me and give advice when it wasn't asked for. Again I understand and appreciate that you were trying to help but I explained already that for me personally it is not helpful. I would kindly ask you to leave it at that.
lonely,fkfnkzn,t1_fkfm1eu,1584138412.0,"Well she knows how I feel, I talk to her about it but she'll say that she can't do anything about it, which is kinda true. I mean its not like I am expecting her to do anything about it but in that case she just kinda doesnt want to talk about it anymore. Also I think she's just tired of my same old bs problem that I'm having for months now, it's just that for me it doesn't stop. So far I just felt like the only options are not to talk to her about my feelings anymore or to ask her not to talk to me about her feelings which is both harmful to the friendship I think :("
ForeverAloneDating,fkfmxs3,t1_fkflgbr,1584137996.0,"Because the whole base point of it is the words ""no expectations"" which I said in a more common understanding as it would be used in online dating rather than claiming that I am a master of expectationless gratitude life zen and stuff.

In fact I have a lot of problems and solving them is daily hard work. I have found some small concepts throughout my life that have made it a lot easier and healthy, but that's a work in progress. I am pretty sure I didn't promise anything else in my post..

However big concepts like being grateful for life at times of inner despair and fears of isolation I could never work with. My situation will actually worsen because I resent myself for not being happy about the things I have and just end up not wanting to exist at all.

Again, if it works for you and others I am really glad and thanks for sharing this advice but personally I can't do much with it. I feel a lot better embracing my feelings as what they are and taking small steps while reminding myself that its very okay to be mediocre and flawed and that is nothing to be ashamed of."

Sims3,fhsesm0,t1_fhs4qtp,1581859772.0,Thank you so much! I don't know if it was the errorblocker or the fact that my graphics card appeared to be running the game on over 5000 fps (dont ask me) but now I've limited it to 60 it never crashed so far!!
ForeverAloneDating,fhs2krn,t1_fhs1miy,1581850674.0,I saw a comment of yours on the valentines day matchmaking if I'm not mistaken haha. I remember because someone wrote your name is a self fulfilling prophecy 😂 funny
DoesAnybodyElse,fhrwsps,t3_f4lxne,1581842419.0,"Yeah I've been doing it for like 10 years, just that I eat the tissue lol. I guess it's a compulsion like nail biting. Could have psychological reasons, personally I do it when I am stressed. But could just be a habit. Either way I think it would be good to try and stop it. In the last 2 years I've reduced it a lot, but I still sometimes tear it all off when there is a particularly stressful situation."

tipofmyjoystick,fg0974d,t3_epxrnd,1580402919.0,Hello there! Nexpo viewer here. I have not played the game but I'm intrigued. Someone claimed it was associated with house of tales so I reached out to a former developer. I guess it will lead to nothing but I'm just trying to help find it somehow.
DoesAnybodyElse,fcmjsbk,t3_ehqmap,1577778146.0,I work at a cash desk and sometimes I get really annoyed with sick people spreading their germs on the money and basically in my face when they ask questions. It's one of the things I like less about my job.
depression,fb73fa7,t3_ebp5ei,1576571825.0,"Yeah I hate that too. I am a hetero woman but I think very low of myself and I really can't help it. There are good days sometimes but really bad ones too. Most nights I am convinced noone could ever see me as loveable, nice, interesting let alone attractive in some way. But it's not like anyone is proving me wrong. My friends say I'm no different from them and that my only problem is my attitude and I would have all the guys flocking around me. That is such bullshit? If you like a girl just because shes shy and doesnt make the first move you wouldnt just ignore her right? Statistically nobody likes me and thats just how it is. Numbers, facts. I guess it's hard for them, being pretty young girls having to deal with a fat, depressed friend who nobody likes except them."
dogs,faz4gy0,t1_faz3u22,1576411566.0,Yeah the ex gf of my brother got her dog from hungary and basically they didnt care about anything. Back then my bro was staying home with the kids but they seperated and now the dog is alone a lot but she doesn't let me see her anymore since I got a flat with my brother :/
dogs,faz3cd5,t1_fayz8m3,1576411084.0,"Yeah I think so too, I mean in Austria there aren't any street dogs but a lot of people want to help which I think is making certain staff a little arrogant about the whole thing, like being allowed to walk one of the dogs is a privilege, which is just making everything kinda weird."
dogs,faz2jgv,t1_fayzi49,1576410728.0,"Yeah thats obvious, my question is not if I should get a dog now, my question is what is the major opinion about reasons to get a dog, because some people feel very strongly that if you want to get a dog for these reasons you shouldnt. Maybe I should leave that bit out cause its kinda misleading from the question^^"

She acts like she needs to educate me on how to appreciate myself for who I am yet tells me what I need to change in my behaviour and all. It gets really frustrating and I've been thinking about not telling her at all what is going through my head, but then again she always asks. Like what is the point..."
depression,fai0xf1,t3_e8wf5e,1576097568.0,"I feel exactly the same way about birthdays, you are not alone in that sense. Out there are others resenting themselves, there are not only happy, functioning people. Maybe it helps to think that it's not your unique faultiness that turns the normal world, normal social groups away, the world is a very fucked up place :( I am sure you are doing the best you can.
