xboxone,fqqoyav,t1_fqqmlpg,1589569348.0,"You can't enjoy Far Cry 2 the same way you do Far Cry 3. Far Cry 2 is more about surviving a hostile and detailed environment where nothing cares about you. Far Cry 3 is more about becoming a bad ass and it's a lot of fun, but it lost a lot of character when Ubi shaped the game to be enjoyed by a wider demographic. Far Cry 2 just feels like it makes it unnecessarily tough which turns a lot more of people off, but it also makes the game feel way more tense which makes it appeal to more of a niche market. 

Far Cry 2 also had a focus on creating a realistic Africa. Here's a video showing the improvements that Far Cry 2 made that are now absent from the Far Cry series: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FCeEvQ68jY8"

patientgamers,fq1y71y,t3_gg4xjt,1589051095.0,"I liked the lack of connection between the characters. It made me confused after the final heist when they all started screaming at each other. They should be dead, why are they all mad at each other instead of celebrating? It's because these guys aren't friends, they're cooworkers. 

There's numerous moments throughout the story where one of them will ask the other one to do something friendly like hangout or open up, but they get turned down every time. An example would be Franklin will trying to open up to Michael, and Michael makes it about himself. Also, at the end of the heist where you hack the shit out of a computer on top of a sky scraper Franklin invites everyone to drink at his place, but everyone except fucking Lester ends up leaving simply because they don't want to celebrate with the others. GTAV is a story about a bunch of cooworkers who stick together because of greed. 

Idk, I really enjoy Rockstar's writing. Red Dead 2 has my favorite writing in a Rockstar game. It feels like there's a lot beneath the surface"
patientgamers,fpu30wf,t3_gfac2u,1588903583.0,"I just played the game first time a couple weeks ago, and idk I thought that it was pretty damn good. The clickers are unreal, I haven't been so unnerved by a video game before. I also thought that the requirement to conserve ammo was really well done. They nailed a shooter where the guns usually have 10 bullets in reserve. 

If Joel wasn't well done then we wouldn't understand his actions at the end of the game. 

Overall, the game made me excited to try out the other PS4 exclusives that I've been missing out on while mainly gaming on an Xbox.. finishing the game also made me more annoyed at TLoU pt.2 being delayed"

dyinglight,fpslag2,t1_fpr1m2i,1588875386.0,"I 100% agree.

Their game gets delayed and they don't say why, and then an article comes out and gives us a reason that fits. The article can't give hard sources because they're allegedly ex/current employees, but the article is far more believable than this person saying ""haha, the game is going great!"" after being delayed. The only people that the tweet could convince are people who *really* want this game to be a success.
