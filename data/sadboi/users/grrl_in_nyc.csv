I hadn't thought of the song as quite this beach and fun oriented visually, but seeing people chilling felt so much needed, and almost perfect for where we are.    The cheekiness was fun and in contrast to the other videos from the album I think there's space to have something that fits the song that isn't a traditional narrative or a story with a lot to read into.  I also feel like I consumed all my Vitamin C for the next couple of weeks, so A++ would consume again.  Art direction, fashion and feeling all felt so happy, and we all need it.

KillingEve,fqbxgzf,t3_ghu9ry,1589245854.0,"Fantastic analysis - I'll need to reread these and any others you posted.

The choice to just focus on V makes sense, and while the Harvest did start to feel a little forced, the pacing for the episode picked up perfectly.  It quickly felt into the Shining with its foreboding feeling, and the combination of music, how the shots were set up and the incredible acting by both Jodie and Evgenia Dodina (as the Mom from The Depths of Cold Hell) made this one of the best endings ever.  Their acting and the writing of their confrontation was just painful and so very real to the heartache of parents and children with abandonment issues.  You saw V more vulnerable that we've ever seen here, only to be met with coldness as a response. As much of a monster as V is, it is heartbreaking to see her met with such cruelty. The amount of self awareness was unexpected and strangely beautiful.  ""I'm not happy"" indeed.

If there's any justice Jodie would win an Emmy for that scene, and in acting classes they'll have her ending on the train as . a master class as what the essence of acting is about. It's not just 'reveal the inner mind and emotions of a character'. She cycles through the despair, rage, longing, psychosis, brokenness, redemption and resolve in her character that make you feel both such sadness and fear at the same time that mirror her internal conflict. The eerie music is chilling.  It's almost as unnerving as any amazing movie that leaves you unsettled - a glimpse into someone's head at its most vulnerable, both unraveling and growing stronger, all in about 20 seconds.  She is a master at her craft."

Wherever possible, being realistic about what success looks like helps.  Are you being too perfectionist about it, and automatically catastrophizing because it's not perfect or finished? I also try and reward myself with something positive after completing some annoying adult thing (paperwork especially) and remind myself that I did it and I got through it.

I don't think it's necessarily bad that you want to know exactly what's expected - it certainly will matter in work, where accuracy often really matters, and meeting other people's expectations is so often important.  I have a lot of problems asking clarifying questions and asking for help - are there ways to prioritize the questions to ask, and check with other people to say 'am I asking too many questions'? Often people like to help, so if it's for schoolwork, ask away.  Your professors are there to answer them - it's your education, and if you need the help, ask for it.

I see how that sometimes people overreact, but it's not me - I'm the person/thing in front of them they're overreacting or taking things out on and often it's not me.  I don't need to overthink most things now because I see it's nothing to me with me - it's often the other person, which is why I believe a lot of social interactions are so hard for us to understand.  It's not about us needing to be liked, or self-loathing - sometimes it's about them.
