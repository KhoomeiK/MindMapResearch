Yeah I'm not exactly a theist but sometimes it's good to forgo certain things to a god so that I'm not overly anxious or depressed over things and events i can't change"
JordanPeterson,fr6rzcs,t1_fr15wvj,1589932061.0,thanks for your question. The responsibility here is the need to take on the challenge of life with open arms and courage. To not shy away from doing what is meaningful to you so that you can forge meaning with the time you have here on this world.

Secondly, there is nothing wrong with you unless you think there is. Remember that people sadly come and go in your life and this applies to best friends as well as relationships. 

You can only spend this time to reflect on what you want to change and weight it up whether it is a compromise on who you are if you just blatantly follow what people tell you.

&#x200B;

I think it's healthy to be wary, which you are, of your personal tendencies so you can mitigate it. Even this conversation itself is healthy and enjoyable for me as we're understanding each other - i think it comes down to the subreddit that you're in :((

&#x200B;

But yeah, all the best to you - tbh I don't think you have OCD as I know people with it and the traits they exhibit are very extreme so yeah, maybe seek some solace knowing that? All the best bud"
