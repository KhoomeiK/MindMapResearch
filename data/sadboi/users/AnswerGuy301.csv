maryland,fpduhw5,t1_fpdcab4,1588534489.0,"Exactly. The Democrats'  devils' bargain, so to speak, is that they've given up on this one seat (in exchange for having six super-safe seats and a seventh that is only winnable by the GOP in a ""perfect storm"" kind of year) and the holder of this particular seat never really needs to worry about appealing to anyone but the hard right. As an added bonus, this Republican is likely never going to be a viable statewide candidate. 

And yes, while the Eastern Shore is pretty conservative, it's only about \~60% of the district's population and is not as uniform as people might think it is.  The other 40% or so is neighborhoods in Greater Baltimore the area's Democrats specifically didn't want to represent, many of which Andy Harris had previously represented in the legislature.

Coronavirus,fpds9e1,t1_fpdlvlx,1588533198.0,"Trump seems like the natural culmination of the ""anyone could do this job"" mentality that has kind of creeped into the political mainstream over the preceding decades. The people that believe this talked themselves into the notion that 2017-19 validated their idea, but all it really validated was that the country could sort of run itself on autopilot for a while as long as it didn't imminently require a course correction of the sort that autopilot couldn't accomplish. 

But we reached a juncture where autopilot wasn't going to suffice. It could have been a huge natural disaster or a terror attack bigger than 9/11, it happened to be a pandemic. And now we see the value of having leadership. Apologists for those in power can say this no one could have seen this coming all they want, but this event was pretty foreseeable even if its specific details may not have been. 

So no, not just ""anyone can do this job."" 

Although in this case it's even worse than that, as there's a better chance than an ordinary schlub elevated to the highest office in the land, even if incapable of leading a nation through it, would be more likely to choose one of the other two possible options - follow or get out of the way - as opposed to however one would characterize what the current White House occupant is doing. The federal government is full of people who are competent and capable at their jobs if they're allowed to do them, and one salient feature of this administration and its supporters has been a pretty constant effort to undermine the people doing those jobs. So no following. As for getting out of the way, well, states were told that they were on their own, but FEMA seized some equipment that states had obtained for themselves, and we've got an AG trying to force states to reopen, which would be a very different reading of the 10th Amendment than that I am accustomed to hearing from those who call themselves conservatives."

I wouldn't characterize VW as I understand it as a ""critique of capitalism"" per se so much as it is a longing for a flavor capitalism that more easily lent itself to the music and imagery most VW uses as its source material. Many of the dead malls are dead because the jobs left town, others are dying because the only retail business models that work now are those cater mostly to the wealthiest 1% among us or provide a host of false economies to people sliding further down the income/class scale. (There's online shopping to consider, which has cut things down across the board and if people are at home on their computers and phones buying things they're likely not participating in the kind of collectively shared aesthetic lingo that birthed VW's source material.) 

I'm just old enough to have been a mallrat during the second half of the Golden Age of the Mall and the tail end of the Golden Age of the Video Arcade. It seems like most VW is made by people younger than me who may not have direct memories of those times.

urbanplanning,fmnp464,t1_fmli4ui,1586231457.0,"These things don't always break neatly along the usual political lines, at least not in the USA. There are a lot of arguments about urbanism that might appeal to some more conservative/libertarian types, if they're not mostly in it for either the racism or the ""everything about big cities is bad"" rural/exurban pseudo-populism; in the case of actual elected officials, the ""fossil fuel and automobile industries finance our campaigns""  factor is ever-present. 

The government - usually local, but sometimes state - often mandates that there be parking available for residences and businesses alike, and in many cases that it be free parking. That sounds pretty ""nanny state"" to me, even as a liberal. 

Local governments also often mandate that only single-family houses can be built on certain plots of land - frequently covering most of the land - under their jurisdiction. It can be hard to separate this kind of zoning from the kind that prevents a neighboring property owner from building, say, a leather tannery or an auto body shop or an oil refinery next to your home. Both boost local property values and as such are generally supported by homeowners in a given area. The first kind also tends to keep out less affluent residents, who are often people of color - and this is where the ""in it for the racism"" factor kicks in; in many cases, it's hidden behind or mixed in with questions/concerns about traffic or parking or sewer infrastructure. If we're talking about a place where most people see themselves liberal/progressive expect them to be very careful about anything that sounds like ""keeping those people out"" and instead talk about historic buildings and greedy developers."
askgaybros,fmnjyr0,t3_fw0nrf,1586227819.0,"Sometimes I feel like there's a ""survivor bias"" to all the heartwarming ""coming out to parents"" stories I read on this sub and some other subs, so I appreciate hearing the other side of things that I know is out there. I waited until I was more or less independent, which was a good call. There's a reason this is still a landmark moment in a gay man's life, and why so many of us (I'm no exception) put it off for as long as we can. 

My Dad still doesn't really accept me, but that's OK because I don't really need him in my life. 

I wondered if that was an age thing, as I'm over 40 now and maybe it's different. I think it's better for a lot of people but not everyone. 

Thank you for sharing. Glad you're on your own two feet. For now, concentrate on building your new life."
