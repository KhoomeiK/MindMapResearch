SuicideWatch,fpxvisx,t3_gfsv5a,1588990433.0,"Honest to god only thing that helped me were meds. Therapists did nothing, but my psychiatrist did. Find a psych that actually listens to you when you tell them the meds you’re trying aren’t working. You have to give them two weeks to a month to actually see any difference, though, so please don’t blow your doctor off when they say you have to try a little longer. Up until around a month, anyways. 

Then tell them you are completely sure that one isn’t helping, and if they continue to argue, tell them you’ll seek help elsewhere. They’ll either change their tune or you’ll find someone new. MDD is a mental disorder, just like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, BPD, etc. Don’t toss out medication as “not for you.” I did that for years and it was a big fucking mistake. If you actually, truly, want to get better, you’re going to have to put whatever effort you have into figuring out how to actually treat your illness."
SuicideWatch,fpq1k4u,t3_gen4q2,1588813330.0,"I was once in your place, too. From 13-16 my life was an absolute living hell. My brain refused to function normally despite doing everything I felt possible to fix the situation. I just turned 18, and my life is completely different than it was back then. I got on antidepressants, talked to friends who understood, and worked hard to finish high school so that I could start my adult life off strong. 

It was extremely difficult, though. The thought of getting out of bed was simply too much some days. I didn’t have the energy to shower, eat, or even do easy, enjoyable things like play games. Seeing a doctor and asking to try antidepressants didn’t solve everything immediately. I had to try at least 10 different medications until one really, truly worked.

It’s a hard process, and sometimes it’ll feel like the doctors don’t know what they’re doing, that they don’t care, like they won’t take your problems seriously. But keep advocating for yourself, asking questions, and doing your best to learn about yourself and how to cope with the issues you face.

Some days, you’ll just have to take it easy. You might have to stay in bed, or have to keep activities to a minimum. It might be too much to eat three full meals in a day. The goal you should have is to be able to do a few healthy things in one day. Maybe one day you take a shower and drink more water than normal. Another, maybe you’ll do something you enjoy. Some days you’ll be able to eat a good amount of food.

It takes a long time to build up to being able to do all of these things in one day, and you shouldn’t force yourself to do them all just because you feel like you have to. Take things slowly, and if you start feeling burnt out, take a rest. If you can’t complete everything you wanted to do in a day, try not to sweat it. It’ll just make you upset, which in turn will make it harder to do the things you want the next day.

Try to find a hobby you enjoy. It doesn’t have to be immediately. If you’d rather work on taking care of yourself first, that’s completely fine. Having a creative output will help you get your emotions out in a healthy way, though.

Your family is going to hurt you sometimes. Parents or other guardian-type family members try their best to protect you and help you grow, but they don’t always do it in the best ways. I spent years resenting my mother for things, and our relationship was very strained. She yelled at me a lot, and I refused to cooperate with the things she wanted me to do. 

Teenage years for just about everybody are like that, so try not to let yourself feel like your family doesn’t care about you just because you’ve gotten into an argument. If things ever get heated, let them cool off for a while. Collect your thoughts and feelings, and calmly talk about how you feel. 

Say things like “I feel a bit sad about what we argued about earlier. I’m sorry if I made you feel bad, too. Can we talk and try to work out a solution to the problem?” Obviously, it doesn’t have to be nearly as formal, but saying things like “I feel” rather than “you made me feel” will come off as less aggressive and the person you’re talking to will generally be more willing to talk peacefully.

In all honesty, it’s not going to be easy to fix everything. It’s going to take ages and it’s going to suck quite a lot before it starts to get better. But when they do get better, it’ll all feel worth it. Things that once felt impossible will become habitual, easier than easy. 

Hopelessness is the only real enemy here. If you don’t have it in you to hope for yourself, find other people to hope for you. You’re not a burden. Don’t stop yourself from asking for help just because you feel like you don’t deserve the help. You’ve already made it this far. Keep on keeping on."

I’ve been asking my psychiatrist to start something that was neither an SSRI or and SNRI, and she started me on one called trintellix and said it wasn’t either. Looking it up, it’s an SSRI still but works differently than others. It’s actually somehow worse on my stomach than any other I’ve tried so far lol.

Cyclicvomiting,fmbsvkh,t3_fub98r,1585932596.0,I’d say refrain from smoking for two weeks to a month if you can and see if your vomiting returns. If so it’s probably due to THC. I only eat edibles but I get nausea from weed pretty often. If you don’t show any symptoms other than nausea and vomiting it might not be connected to migraines. Can I ask what medications you’re taking? Some can cause some pretty severe GI issues and there’s a possibility those could be causing it.
