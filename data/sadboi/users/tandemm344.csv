My problem is much more Anxiety (overthinking, fear, internal panic, worry, rumination) than depression. The anxiety CAUSES the depression if that makes sense. 

I'm hesitant to try a ""cocktail"" as well. Apparently my doctor is too, seeing that she hasn't ever suggested adding one medication on top of another. But I see the benefits. You've given me a little hope that there's more solutions/options available to me than I'd originally thought."
Anxiety,firc4un,t1_firawze,1582661546.0,"I was tested specifically for that mutation only, which my psychiatrist recommends everyone get tested for, but that's it. Nothing like the genesight test (I think that's what its called, whatever the test is that tells you the best antidepressant to use). It was identified that i DO have this specific mutation and I'm now taking supplements for it, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything at all (still don't feel that much better.)

Here's as much of my psychiatrist's ""reasoning"" as I can remember. My first psychiatrist sucked, he put me on Wellbutrin without asking many questions. I assume that's just what he tried with all new patients. Supplementary vistaril for possible increased anxiety, but that didn't mitigate it. Way too much anxiety and irritability, took me off Wellbutrin. I really didn't like this doc, no personality or empathy at all, so I switched.

The rest of the medications I listed came from my new, current psychiatrist. None of these were stacked, all seperate.

She put me on Trintellix, telling me it was newer, minimal side effects besides nausea. The ""cadillac"" of ADs she called it. The nausea and minimal gains were not worth it. Who wouldn't want to try the ""cadillac"" I guess.

She then went with Lamictal, I don't particular know or remember why. I really don't know. Went off that because of the rash. Scary shit.

Vraylar low-dose to try stabilizing my mood I guess? A bit of a different approach, I know this is primarily an antipsychotic. But shesaid it has benefits for anxiety and depression in low-doses. Taken off because it made me way too physically tired. I wouldn't even be able to function at work.

She then suggested Viibryd because she said it's very similar to Trintellix which I had very mild improvements with. We figured ""why not, lets try it."" I'm trying it now and I seem to have increased anxiety (or still persistent anxiety, definitely not getting better). 

I'm going to ask about Buspar, maybe? I know my primary problem is anxiety/worry/rumination/irritability much moreso than depression. I've told her this many times (hoping there's specific medications meant for anxiety FIRST? if that makes sense). I try CBD as well, but it doesn't seem like its helping at all. 

Like I said, I guess my next step is a regular SSRI"

I would assume everything will continue to clear up the more you take the prescribed medications. You can use Benadryl cream or hydrocortisone cream to stop the itch, but if it “burns” that stuff might irritate it. Make sure you’re documenting each rash spot every day, hell even morning and evening, if it isn’t getting better and you feel more and more “burning” id go to the ER right away. Also go to the ER immediately if there’s any kind of rash or redness appearing around or IN your mucous producing areas (mouth, nose, genitals, etc)

And if you’re taking Benadryl (antihistamines) my doctor told me Zantac (ranitidine) essentially boosts the effectiveness of the Benadryl so I was on that as well. 

Just be conscious of yourself, evaluate whether it’s getting overall worse or better as a whole, and have someone else close give their input as well.

And thank you for updating, I hope it gets better friend. For what it’s worth, my ER doctor calculated the half-life of the Lamictal already inside my body (25 mg daily for 7 days) and said it would take about a full week if not longer for the drug to exit my system"

I’d recommend taking the prednisone too personally, I was given 60mg for 5 days, then tapering off just to be safe. Everything returned to normal about a week later. The ER doctors explained to me that Lamictal has a half life which would stay in me about a week even though I stopped taking it the day of the ER visit.

Edit, to add: check and document the rash areas on your body day by day with your smartphone camera. If you have a partner, have them look at it each day and give their input as well, this isn't anything to fuck around with. 

If you notice skin peeling, or secreting fluid, blistering etc... go to the ER right away. I posted several threads across several subreddits when I had the rash and the majority of the responses were ""go to the ER"" and....they weren't wrong. you might just have the regular rash, but it's always better to be safe.

So if someone were taking a high dose of ADs for many years, I imagine the effects would stick around for quite a while.

Please don’t assume what I’m feeling. This isn’t cut and dry. Honestly if she left me? I don’t know if I’d be devastated. Im afraid I wouldn’t feel much, I certainly don’t feel much now. A non-depressed version of me would feel pretty devastated, but what I am now? I really don’t know. All the guilt I’m having would be presumably gone but that isn’t the right way to fix that. And I don’t want to let our 6 years be for nothing when I have all the evidence that our relationship used to be better and I used to feel more.

It’s just....not as simple as “you’re going to lose this if you don’t fight."

mentalhealth,esdv5v4,t3_c78in8,1561869805.0,"Its a noble and selfless thing for sure. I’ve tried going down that route over the past few years, slowly realizing I don’t give much of a shit about myself and care way more about the happiness of the people I care about.

It hasn’t worked out well. I needed to realize that I deserve to experience some happiness, and that (ironically) the people I’m tying to make happy will NOT be happy if they learn I’m forgoing my own happiness for theirs."

Lately my irritability has only been going up, and it’s scaring me. I wake up feeling “sour” or immediately on edge which is the worst feeling in the world when your only escape is sleep.

I can’t take the smallest jokes, overreact to things (on the inside), and am just constantly on edge with this annoying fucking feeling in my throat.

I sometimes feel like I could start gasping for air at any second.

The absolute worst part is that my girlfriend/partner has to experience my sour joyless mood every day, and that guilt only makes me more angry with myself.

So I feel you, you aren’t alone"

antidepressants,es8dpso,t3_c6e7hi,1561694520.0,"Ha funny actually, I just started it as well. I’m on day 3 of the 5mg dose before moving up to 10mg on Day 8, no side effects or positive effects yet. Here’s hoping for the both of us ❤️

My psychiatrist told me it will take about 7-10 days to notice effects, if you think you can hold out I’d stick with it. You’ve got this :)"

depression,es6x967,t1_es5kdfw,1561659314.0,Yeah that's wholly untrue. There's plenty of good people in the world.
antidepressants,es6tkly,t3_c681l5,1561657026.0,When I was on it for Depression I was told it could take anywhere from 2-4 weeks. I'd stick with it for a month unless there's any really detrimental side effects.
