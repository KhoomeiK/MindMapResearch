She was an attention whore using her body to lure her prey then she used everyone as a emotional and financial support, the worst part  that she sometimes feels bad about it too and she's bipolarðŸ™ƒ

3~6 suicide attempts and from what i know she started cutting some time after she realized what she's done to me, then went back to fuck you useless piece of shit even though i was her best friend at least for almost 2months, the fact that she's bipolar can't really excuse her behavior forever, i don't even know fs if she started cutting agin bcs of me or not, i don't really want to tell all the bs she told so yeah, this is it.

I'v already found a new one, i'm not that ugly how i think i'm:D
