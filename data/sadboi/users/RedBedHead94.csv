BPD4BPD,fduoy9e,t3_emqohp,1578736533.0,"Not great tbh. 

Found a fair size bald patch on my head on Monday, either alopecia or to do with the hair products I was using... I fear the former because it's a pretty uniform patch. So I started the week panicking that I was going bald and therefore my partner is going to leave me for someone who isn't a sad egg.

Then had my grandads funeral... Didn't know him so well so nbd, but did find out that the reason I never got to know him or my nan is because my late mum lied to me about how shitty they were as people for some dumb reason. Turns out my nan isn't shitty at all and I was basically a weapon for a personal issue between those two. So that's great. So it's been a very low and BPD trigger heavy week. 

Much love and positivity to everyone. I often lurk and don't post but I'll try to show the love where I can 😊"

askwomenadvice,fdun1v6,t3_en3i7w,1578735580.0,"Great advice so far from others....and from yourself to yourself! You didn't need us!

Snacks are important. Other than that.... ask her what she would benefit from. I know when I'm going through tough situations I'd just like him there to listen and check on me and hold my hand... and feed snacks but that's a given. 

Also... She might be in pain and be a bit low for a little while. That might make her grumpy. Remember that she isn't meaning to take anything out on you, and it's not personal. Just continue to make her feel secure and looked after and it'll pass in no time. 

You're a good egg, I'm sure she'll appreciate your thoughtfulness!"

Block off his pictures from your social media and soon enough you'll be comfortable with the fact he's off living a life."

I can't remember how we all started meeting up but now we have a few big gatherings a year, plus a weekend away where we rent this huge old pub in the countryside together each year so we can kick back, catch up and play games together. Got particularly close to one couple who have basically adopted me as a little sister, and I go visit them sometimes to just shoot the shit and hang out with their cats.

It generally all goes well because of our shared interests and similar sense of humour. We're all very supportive and trusting of each other and I couldn't ask for better friends!"

I've learned to take a step back, or a breath, and to observe before reacting to things. I've learned to accept good enough, and to be more patient. I've started to learn that it's okay to communicate feelings before they blow up, and that most people aren't the kind of people who would get mad at you for doing this.

The mirena will still work its magic on contraception for at least 5 years but by this point it seems the hormones dip too low to fully control menstruation and it’s symptoms. Still, It’s been pretty smooth sailing until now for me, and I wish you a happy IUD experience!"
birthcontrol,erhjdjh,t3_c23zds,1560876547.0,"Hi! I’ve had my Mirena for 5 years, I’m due a swap for a new one tomorrow hopefully. 

The pain sucks - I thought it was the worst period cramps ever, as you’ve had a baby where I haven’t, it will hopefully be less uncomfortable (either because your little one has made some room or because you’ve given birth so you already know how tough you are!) I recommend taking some painkillers about 45mins before you go (I’m a huge wimp so I get OTC cocodamol + Ibuprofen, but you know what works for you.) 

The cramps I experienced lasted a day. After that, just felt a bit tender and bruised for a few days (nothing emotional, just a bit sore.) Then all was fine! Rest up the day off and take it easy for another day or so after - you know your body best. 

Check your strings regularly, the length will change based on your cervix position so don’t freak, and if you can’t find them try to have a feel of your cervical opening too - they can sometimes curl up and rest in there (mine did for a bit and gave me a hecking concern, but they popped back out and all was fine!) 

If you have any worries or concerns, go speak to your doctor! Better safe than sorry! 

Good luck, I hope it all goes well for you."
