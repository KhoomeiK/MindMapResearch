mentalhealth,fn7wahr,t3_g01kpw,1586728920.0,"Not well. It reminds me when I was with my narcissist ex husband. I'm not just saying that. He's diagnosed as NPD with sociopathic tendencies. He isolated me from everything and everyone. He refused to let me work or get my license. I wasn't allowed to leave the apartment. He would change the password on my computer and only let me on it if I was ""good"". Meaning I had to do everything perfectly and the way he wanted. I wasn't allowed to talk, if I did, he'd beat the crap of out me. If he was drinking, which was always, I sometimes had to just be in the room with him for him to go after me. I would barricade myself in the bedroom because he broke the lock before to get me. I would stack furniture in a line to the opposite wall so he couldn't force the door open. He would scream at me if anyone mentioned me to me thinking I went on Facebook even though he had changed all the passwords so I couldn't go on social media or Skype. Being stuck at the house like this is triggering me all the time now. I can't stop feeling like I'm on the verge of breaking down or going to have a panic attack at any moment. This was 9 years ago that it happened and my now partner doesn't know exactly how bad the abuse was. How isolated and the extent of everything he did. And I don't know how to explain it when I start getting on edge and it makes me very irritable and prone to angry outbursts or crying when I'm alone and scrambling to get myself to feel safe."

I see more men playing the field as they get older and being cheaters if they do land a relationship than women as they get older. This jargon about the ""friendzone"" isn't real. You aren't friend zoned. Maybe that attitude, expecting women that do begin with just friendships to be romantically or sexually interested in a man because somehow they owe it to the guy, is what leads to them being unattracted. Women can sense that kind of thing and guys that scream about the ""friendzone"" usually have really piss poor attitudes toward women and act like whiny jerks once they realize the girl doesn't want them in that way at the time that the man deems it should be so. I was friends with my SO for years before we started dating, he never once had this thought process and both he and I dated other people while still being friends.

 Hollow by Belle Mt

She told me she was hollow 

That's far from what I see  

She's more than just the daughter of a broken man to me  

She told me she was shallow  

Her rivers run so deep  

If I could only be the boat that leads her to the sea

But lonely is her favorite place to be  
When she feels the hurt she lets it bleed  
Sometimes she's lost, sometimes she's broken  
Sometimes she's closed, sometimes she's open  
But lonely is her favorite place to be

She told me she was falling  
I offered her my hand  
she only finds her comfort in not knowing just how hard she's gonna land  
I told her she was special  
She almost let me in  
But she couldn't bare the thought of digging up the heart that she'd been burying

Lonely is her favorite place to be  
When she feels the hurt she lets it bleed  
Sometimes she's lost, sometimes she's broken  
Sometimes she's closed, sometimes she's open  
Lonely is her favorite place to be

Lonely is her favorite  
If only I could change it  
If I could only save her  
Lonely is her favorite  
If only I could change it  
If I could only save her

But sometimes she's lost, sometimes she's broken  
Sometimes she's closed, sometimes she's open  
Sometimes she's stone cold, times she's on fire  
Mostly she's everything I desire  
Lonely is her favorite place to be  
Lonely is her favorite place to be

She told me she was hollow"

Once all of this blows over hopefully there will be a belated birthday party and you and your friends can all celebrate then!!!

Anxiety,fl8yj2n,t3_fmyb7k,1584935653.0,"Yep. I hope you at least got a nap during the day. Funny thing is, lack of sleep makes anxiety worse and of course that leads to no sleep. Most times I just keep going until I collapse from exhaustion. They have me on sleeping meds but those don't even work.

Just be aware, there will be the shakes, nausea, and your ability to control your emotions gets really hard to do.

Weird advice :stay hydrated, have some comfort food. I do chicken soup. It's soothing and gentle on your stomach."
Wishlist,fl7cubn,t3_fn23e2,1584899116.0,I use a calendar whiteboard to do any planning. The man likes using his online calendar for everything but I need a physical thing I can see at all times. And it's fun to use to write any notes or a little message for my oldest to see in the morning before she goes to school.
politics,fl6uok7,t1_fl6sa9q,1584883935.0,"Yep. Have a friend. Was mocking anyone taking this seriously and saying it's just like a mild flu. Who cares.

He's starting to sweat a little about it now."
politics,fl6cf8n,t1_fl64n8t,1584862616.0,"I love Bernie to bits and have supported him both times he's ran. Yet, I feel the change is coming, it's just right now isn't the time. With Biden, there's actually a chance that a lot of center Republicans will vote for him because he's ""safer"" and not Trump."
Wishlist,fl5wx08,t1_fl5wpc9,1584847855.0,It's gotta be the magic that draws them in so much! It has just the right elements of silliness and story too.
Wishlist,fl5wlh7,t1_fl5w1yw,1584847613.0,"Oh gosh, Frozen had just come out when she was that age and that was the only movie she would watch beside Gremlins."
Wishlist,fl5w7x2,t1_fl4iwsu,1584847327.0,"We do. Sadly, she is starting to get into the later stage of dementia after about 3 years of decline. On a happy note though, she remembered my oldest daughter the other day when we called and knew my name so it was a really good day."
Wishlist,fl5vx8n,t1_fl48ief,1584847105.0,"We watched Spaceballs today at her request. I've been making a list of movies I enjoyed as a kid. Also some I never really liked but I know she'll get a kick out of, like, Mean Girls or 10 Things I Hate About You, 50 First Dates. She loves chick flicks. So far I have those, all the old Adam Sandler movies, Goonies, Titanic, LOTR, Buffy the Vampire Slayer... She's determined to get me to let her watch some Stephen King movies but those might be too scary for her yet.
She wanted a ""cool"" anime to watch so we started Attack on Titan."
Wishlist,fl5v0sz,t1_fl3wbi7,1584846437.0,"Wikipedia sub on here. It randomly popped up a few days ago on my feed! Haha.

Awww, he sounds wonderful! That's really sweet of him.

I hope you had a great read of the day and he got to enjoy his snacks. The kiddos always keep me pretty busy during the day."
Wishlist,fl5uo2l,t1_fl3xd0x,1584846172.0,"Have you ever tried your hand at fx makeup? I use to work one of those haunted hayrides and got really into it. It was a lot of fun to come up with different ways to become a zombie or what ever monster they needed me to be. I would use household items and some rubber latex. Few cotton balls and paper towels later, dab a little makeup and fake blood and boom, horror story of a face. Hehe"
