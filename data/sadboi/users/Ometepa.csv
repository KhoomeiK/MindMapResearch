Psychonaut,fm07wjn,t3_fs6y9i,1585648220.0,"I've been through the same and I see 3 options from my experience. First, try to go very gradually. Smoke only 1 or 2 hits. let a few days pass, try again..stop  before it gets intense. and accept that you will not be able to be really stone again in the coming months because that's very likely to put you back in that state. Option 2, Big break from weed, for several months at least. It can great and solve the pb, but it's also possible that you feel the exact same bad when you smoke again (it was the case for me). 3rd option : smoke some weed and mindfully face your fear. When you start to panic: go ahead, ask for more, smoke more and try to get ""through"". A fear remains as long as you are not capable to face it. If you show your brain ""that's ok, you can send me these thoughts and stuff, i don't Care"" anxiety lowers and eventually disappears.
As someone with Ocd, i Can tell you this about anxiety: your brain is like a snowy hill. With your badtrip you went down with your sledge and made some deep marks in the snow. This path is anxiety. Your brain will want to make you take that same path over and over again, unless you directly do something about it (mindfulness, meditation, exposure to your anxiety) esp. with weed which takes off the usual mental ""waterwings"" we have.
So best options are to give your mind a rest, give yourself a chance to digest this experience and understand what it meant for you...weed might get in the way of that process for a while, unless you try to use it at your advantage and go all in (option 3) which I wouldn't recommend if you are not experienced in meditation, because obviously this one can go very wrong...."

Energy enables everything, from agriculture, to production and transport of all the goods, to people not working in the fields anymore but in service jobs in big cities, to 7.5 billion humans. Everything around you (the chair you sit on, the clothes you wear, the computer you type on etc etc) has been produced by a machine. These machines eat energy, in the form directly of fossil fuels or or electricty, mostly produced from fossil fuels (70-80% of primary energy consumed is fossil).....Basically our whole modern world is based on cheap, dirty energy. Almost everything we have developed since the industrial revolution was enabled to fossil fuels.

And if you look at the figures, we are VERY VERY far from the paradigm change required (ie switching to renewables etc). There will be 2 limitations on fossil fuels: the amount still avaialble underneath the earth surface, and the fact that we found out that we screw up the climate when we burn them, so the good news is that the world WILL change no matter what.
