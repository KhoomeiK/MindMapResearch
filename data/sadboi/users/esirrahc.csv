One of my friends attempted suicide a few days ago. I would do everything in my power to stop him from hurting. I don’t know what help I could offer that would actually help. I have offered. I have checked on him so many times in the last few weeks. He doesn’t realize how amazing he is. 

I’ve been suicidal. I don’t know how things shifted, but they did. People DO care about you. I understand the pain. I don’t know how I survived. They really do get fucking better."
