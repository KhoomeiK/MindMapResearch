Yes, there might be some social trails here and there, but other places you would lose the trail.

ShrugLifeSyndicate,fpr2e3u,t1_fpkd7xz,1588839951.0,"I am someone who transitioned from bring suicidal to not feeling quite so bad. The transition came as much thorough positive changes in my economic well-being as it did through a spiritual evolution. I do share the opinion expressed on another comment that suicidality comes from clinging and a narrow field of view.  
  
I also agree with this:  
  
> Later I've realized that suicide is only the most extreme form of self-destructive behavior: it's definitely not the only one.  
  
My addictive behavior persists.Even though I have made some genuine efforts at curtailing it, I haven't really given it up. And to my addiction I lose whole days. I lose days, weeks, months, and years. I become a shadow of the person I that I was, and that I might have been.  
  
I realised once that addiction is like unto suicide, but one day at a time. 

And if we're talking about the morality of suicide, how it really affects our own lives and souls, and also very much how it effects the lives, souls, and well-being of other people, then we might also contemplate the morality of the lesser self-abandonment and self-harm of addiction.   
  
For both suicide and addiction, I think I am more sympathetic/empathetic to the suffering of the individual than OP is (or at least as is conveyed in the original post). But the suffering and hopelessness of the individual can often be helped. And what OP does very well is to show the impact of self harm and how the harm extends beyond the self, and really effects friends, family, and the fabric of the community. This may also be lessened. I can do better in this world than choosing suicide. I can also do one better for the world than choosing addiction. 

There is hope in all of this. There is the possibility (and possible choice) of being devoted and loving towards others -- while also learning to love oneself more profoundly, too."

moderatepolitics,fov4dl4,t1_foupggd,1588095186.0,"I don't have a lot of time to get into this with you, but let me try. I think you were underestimating the damage done to the Supreme Court when the Republicans denied Obama his last appointment and gave it to Trump. Bush arguably stole the edge in both elections through election fraud, but the Supreme Court decision on Wisconsin voting, along with the rolling to accept the State's gerrymandering without recourse, both show that this administration and the new Republicans are willing to go further to steal elections.   

I think you are underestimating the huge extent of corruption that is opened by having $2 trillion in stimulus, a large portion of which is without any oversight or accountability. That's a massive amount of stolen power. It was done by Trump with a line-item veto, an action which previous Supreme Courts have ruled unconstitutional. 

I think you are underestimating the sheer accumulation of many insults to law, order, and due process that have occurred under Trump.   The EPA recently stopped pollution enforcements during Covid.  The damages done to the scientific advisory system is worse under Trump than Bush. This may seem trivial to you, but the harm and lives lost in the long run because of mismanaging climate change will easily outweigh the million plus lost due to the second war with Iraq and it's aftermath.

I went looking for comparisons between W. Bush and Trump as to which is the ""worst"" president. Have a look. I think they convinced me that it's a fair thing to debate. Bush 2 had his colossal failure of the war in Iraq, plus the assault on civil liberties vis-a-vis the Patriot Act, etc. Trump has many smaller insults to fairness and democracy plus a much larger disrespect for democracy.  

1. [Will Trump Go Down as a Worse President Than Bush?](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/extorting-ukraine-is-far-from-trumps-worst-offense/)    

2. [Dubya Was Bad, but the Donald Might Be Worse: Richard Clarke.](https://www.thedailybeast.com/george-w-bush-was-bad-but-trump-might-be-worse-richard-clarke)  

3. [The worst president. Ever.  ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/05/worst-president-ever/)  

Note that only the last one is up to date re: Covid-19.   
  
My reasoning for feeling Trump is worse is that I think it is going to be harder to come back from one term of his administration than two terms of Bush. If he gets a second term, we will truly, truly be fucked.   

I've left out the badness of the Democratic administrations, but believe me, I know it's there. Much of the unequal bailout of banks happened under Obama's watch, for example. But the destruction of democratic institutions? 


Maybe we can agree to disagree? After all, I was an activist against Bush's war in Iraq and also against his administration's support of corporate media. **The links will make a case, perhaps better than I have, that _it's reasonable to consider that maybe, maybe, Trump is worse._  Or at least that it's not crazy for asking the question and having the debate.**"

much before that?"

moderatepolitics,fottkcu,t1_fot95pa,1588065629.0,"I'm sorry, but Trump is much worse than anything that's come before. He's dismantling the checks and balances in our government. He's gone rogue with an illegal line item veto that gives the Fed a trillion dollars in stimulus money to distribute without oversight. He's turning the United States into a corrupt, violent, mismanaged country.   

I'm no fool, and I know what the other administrations did. But GWB is no longer the worst president ever."

EDIT: this may be wrong.  [One person guessed](https://old.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/g91msy/found_on_guam_in_shallow_water_3meter_diameter/forwcfv/) that it was between the hydrogen and oxygen tanks, because of the honeycomb structures.  However, [the next comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/g91msy/found_on_guam_in_shallow_water_3meter_diameter/fotgjny/), from an aerospace engineer, says that ""honeycomb structures are very common even in parts where you would not expect it.  ...  Honeycomb is kind of the ductape of aerospace construction.""  
  
So maybe it is carcinogenic.  The location of the find may be reason to that it is from a later stage booster, and thus more likely to be from the tanks holding hydrogen and oxygen, but I'm not an expert."
