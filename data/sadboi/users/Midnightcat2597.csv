I had to go on an hour drive several times, bending myself backwards to be available in the schedule they established because it was always on my working hours, got told my references were called and was asked to do a lot of tests and paperwork just to get a crummy rejection email without an answer when I asked what went wrong (since they had an HR person directly working my case I figured it wouldn't be an issue to give me a little bit of feedback after almost 4 months being involved in their interview process)."

TwoXSex,fnn27rj,t3_g2fsgk,1587082843.0,"I've always been the high sex drive one in my relationships. Just like you, sex is more than just physical touch, it makes me feel connected to my partner so I usually crave it. 

With my ex boyfriend our difference in sex drive caused me to feel unloved and ugly because I thought that's why he didn't reciprocate. In the end I initiated the breakup because I couldn't tolerate not being touched (he was barely kissing me or even holding my hand) and not having sex (we didn't spend much time without having sex but I could feel we wasn't into it, just pleasing me, and the lack of general physical touch was too much for me). This really affected my self esteem (also because I found out he was distant because he was into another girl), I felt undesirable. I was left with residual sexual frustration, which caused me to sleep around a bit after the breakup. 

In my current relationship my sex drive is just a bit lower (BC pills) but still higher than my partner's. If I'm feeling really needy and he can't reciprocate because he's busy I just do myself lol, he doesn't mind. But if he's just not into it and just wants to cuddle I just indulge him and try to leave my horniness aside, if I just can't, I do myself. This doesn't really affect my mental health because we are really open with each other, I know he still desires me, he lets me know all the time that he does and he shows it. So I don't feel insecure and know that if he doesn't it's genuinely because he's just not feeling it, is stressed out or is just feeling more romantic."

jobadvice,f47xyu2,t1_f3z5so9,1571429589.0,"Hey shorty413! 

Thanks a lot for your answer. 

My supervisor is also a chemical engineer and she told me the same thing about the formulation, but our boss just wants the results to be the same as the big company´s product. I´ve tried explaining that it would be better to present our product as our own instead of busting it out with in comparisson to the international enterprise´s product, but the salesmen here say they want me to develop such product because this would garantee us an entrance to the market. While I do understand their point, I believe it is impossible for me to get such results without training and at least someone else working with me as a team, but the company seems to be financially struggling at the moment (letting people go, taking their time into approving budgets and so on...) so I doubt my boss would agree to these solutions.

I have mentioned these in the past, before things got rough, but he didn´t listen. I talked with my supervisor and another work buddy, we planned a meeting with our boss to tell him what is the reality of the project (I keep a lot of logs, I´m very organized, but let´s just say I cannot put my full attention to this project because I have to do a lot of other priority situations that come up unexpectedly) and that he needs to have a cool head.

Honestly I don´t think this will end well, I´m already applying to other industries/enterprises and praying I get hired. I wish I could work with you; you sound like a realistic, cool headed and experienced person.

Thanks a lot for your reply."
