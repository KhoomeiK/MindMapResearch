When i still had a car, i would go on long night drives just to calm myself down, i have thought of dying in a car accident multiple times, but i really do not want other people involved or traumatized by shit i have done. 

I have some stuff going for me that could be potentially good but i have no motivation or joy in achieving anything. I literally feel no emotions even when i accomplish something or recieve praise. I just feel relief that what i did didnt suck and made someone happy, but i dont feel happy myself.

I have casually mentioned feeling suicidal to friends and family but i really dont want sympathy or people to feel burdened by it. i dont dare telling my boyfriend because i heard him say before that people who talk about suicide are just being manipulative. Thinking about it now makes me feel angry. Screw him and anyone who say something similar and not understanding."

Some dogs have better lives than humans, some have very sad lives indeed. I guess we humans are a similar fate with man's best friend. My friend's dog eats raw mince meat twice a day and is excedingly spoiled. A street dog's life can be rather bleak in comparison.

My only wish is that I will hurt no one upon my passing, so i guess hanging is not ideal, because it would be an obvious suicide."

My plan is to ghost him once i get back, which I understand is another BPD 'thing' to do, but it's more about trying to reduce the pain im feeling and perhaps he wont give a damn, if im am so much of a burden as he says I am.

The thought of  leaving and ghosting brings me some comfort, not sure if thats a good thing, ghosting sounds lame and mean but it also hurts to be confrontational. And if i have to hear him screaming about how 'Nothing has changed' im going to lose it because he has no idea who hard i have to struggle with this shit everyday"

The boyfriend is not a bad person, i just think he cant deal with this anymore, although i personally feel I am behaving much better, but i suppose if  non BPD has to deal with a BPD long enough, every small thing gets amplified and its easy to blame BPD, even for a 5 minute lapse of 'misbehavior' or not acting normal. im so sick of this, being dead feels like such a relief compared to acting 'normal'"

i also fantasize frequently about just walking out the door and disappearing somewhere, never to be found again, maybe im alive somewhere and living another life but never letting anyone get close to me, or im just dead somewhere.

My boyfriend read a few books about BPD, now he frequently tells me im a textbook case but never gives me any chances to recover or be back to nornal. My 5 minutes of BPD and trying to calm down is equal to his 5 days of being in a rage and constantly reminding me how i fucked up in that 5 minutes of vulnerability. His rage and hostility towards me makes me spiral even more towards being suicidal because it is a constant reminder of how im not a normie, whatever that is.

i find myself thinking of leaving him or finding someone new and start over without the toxic baggage. Boyfriend used to be supportive before he knew about the BPD, now he is more informed, he gives me almost no chances at all."

Which is why now i always have to be on guard, always have to be a good girl 100% of the time. 

Its come to a point either we work it out, which sounds more and more discouraging when he starts screaming that Nothing Has Changed!!!111, or me leaving him but the shitty feelings wont go away, and in the back of my mind i wont be surprised if i kill myself anyway because this BPD thing is a pain in the ass to be reminded of it all the time.

I can't really tell them because the words all sound wrong when i explain, sometimes when i try to be truthful it turns into a fight and i regret ever saying anything in the first place.

I try to look at my behaviour from a 3rd person view and ask myself: if i see someone acting like how Im acting now, would I be scared of the behaviour? Will i feel its an overeaction? If someone else was having the same spiralling unreasonable thoughts as i'm having now, would I feel its too much? 

I wish you all the best and I hope you will have a better relationship in future, just try your best to make the next time be less of a disaster than the time before. Easier said than done i know, because i still struggle with that, but every small improvement and self awareness counts."

Now that im older and wiser, i'm very careful not to get too easily attached to others or put too much emphasis on having an FP. Perhaps its between being more self aware of my problem and wanting less connection so i dont get hurt later on.

Suicides have long term impact on families and friends. I also don't want to contribute to the horror or terrible task of the person who will find my corpse either.

I have often fantasized of just walking away and disappearing somewhere, maybe to die quietly in the forest and never be found. But first I would tell people Im going somewhere and not to look for me, or slowly cut off contact so no one notices my long disappearance. But most days I wish not to wake up from sleep, or some freak accident happens where no one else is blamed for my death.

This runs through my mind even on my good days, but I still find time to go outside to look at the flowers and observe the bugs, listen to the birds and occasionally bake a cake or cook a nice meal for my loved ones.

 Lately I have been tramping around looking for wild field mushrooms near the house and singing aloud while doing so, occasionally the family cats follow me around on those hunts, so i feel like a cartoon character singing in the fields with animal friends around.

BPD,f1az20g,t3_d8k8fn,1569315200.0,"I am the oldest sibling of 3 children in my family. As kids, whenever my little sister screamed or cried or if we fight over something, my mother would automaticaly blame me. As big sister it didnt matter what it was, it was assumed i had something to do with the disturbance, and I would be punished for it. I remeber a few incidents where i was desperately trying to explain to my mother the situation, perhaps she would be a mediator or be patient in listening to my explanation. But that rarely happened, i would get whipped or spanked without even getting to tell my side of the story.

Maybe she was just a tired parent having to deal with 3 active kids, and she just didnt give a fuck who was right or wrong, she just wanted peace and quiet. But incidents like these would fill me with rage and a huge sense of injustice, something i brought over into adulthood. I would be quick to fly into a rage and defend my actions, not giving the other party time to be patient with me or evaluate the situation because I had already exploded.

It took me many years to realize my behaviour stemed from this childhood trauma, the little child in this adult body too fearful to deal with another false accusation and unfair punishment, the huge urge to flee any arguement or any relationship when it took a bad turn, no matter how small.

My sister is successful and well adjusted, married and living in a nice country with her new husband. My brother is doing fine as well, he recently told me he didnt see anything wrong with childhood spankings, because ""we all turned out fine and are doing great"".
