eternium,foy3dag,t1_foy24zq,1588164305.0,"Here's what I've learned since I started playing 6 months ago...

Edit: once you reach 70, then you count Champion Points. Some people have 2000+ points (I have 575 rn 😳). To gain XP, I recommend playing the hardest trial you can complete in 3 minutes. They say Trials 80 & 90 are good for farming legendary items, but I'm not there yet.

If you're curious about which attacks to use... during Trials, click on the map it will show you a breakdown of how effective each attack is--see what works for you. Like... whirlwind doesn't do anything against Bosses for me, **however** it still ranks as an effective attack *for my playing style* .

Edit 2: lots of people on the Leaderboards use ""set armor"" (ex. Juggernaut, Warlord, etc.) I am not there yet. I need more gems before I can craft that stuff. But start looking at which attacks go with which sets as well. 

Seems like Trials are the big deal. That's the only place we get scored--no rewards for completing Legendary or getting all 825/825 stars.

Anyways... you're so young. You deserve better at your age. There are guys that will love you on your period--although I don't have any personal evidence to support it, there are reputable magazines that publish stories about it.

I suggest listening to your intuition. Especially at 16. You shouldn't be overly committed at 16 unless you are at least 90% sure you've met your soul mate. Imo, you have a good 10 years before you ""need"" to settle down."

relationship_advice,ferqfa0,t1_fep6r1e,1579357163.0,"Right. I guess I blame myself (as usual) for agreeing to the marriage. We are fine when we are alone, but he cannot handle being alone for more than 5 minutes--he used too many drugs & his brain is fried. He thinks he's smart, and maybe he has a high IQ...but imo, his brain is fried. Oh well. Can't change people. And I'm stupid to believe him when he said he will compromise.  

For example: ""person is just sleeping here and going to work in the day."" *one week later, person hasn't left our side*

Divorce is always an option, and I'm sure he'll be the one filing. He has more to lose than I do, his social life means everything to him. Much more than I mean to him. And as you can probably tell, I don't fit into his social life.

I was just lonely & he was cute & literally the only person to suggest marriage to me after 29 years on earth.
