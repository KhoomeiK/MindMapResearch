I took a global health course for my graduate nursing program with Dr. Nadia Abuelezam. She is a fantastic teacher, and she was even on MSNBC last month talking about COVID. We also had a guest speaker during the course, Dr. Philip Landrigan, who is a living legend and now the program director for GPH. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip\_J.\_Landrigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_J._Landrigan) 

I highly recommend BC for its strong sense of community and wonderful faculty, although I am biased because I went to BC nursing for both my undergraduate and graduate education. =\]"

MMFB,f7bc2xy,t3_dv6jin,1573564452.0,"Hey there. I’m sorry you’re going through this. Even though I don’t know you, I still believe you can pull this off. I bet you know more than you think you know. These types of examinations are the worst - I’ve done them for undergraduate nursing school and earlier this year for my graduate nursing program. I also struggle with mental health issues and procrastination so I truly feel your pain. In the time between now and your exam, may I suggest searching youtube for videos pertaining your specialty as an alternate study method? I find this to be very helpful for learning as opposed to reading a textbook, lecture slides, etc. which can be extremely overwhelming. 

Take deep breaths my friend. I am rooting for you!"
EatingDisorders,f4ieper,t3_dke70g,1571603048.0,"Hi there,

I am a psychiatric nurse and a psych nurse practitioner student in Massachusetts. I am really sorry about what you are going through. I am extremely concerned about your girlfriend's safety. She really needs inpatient level of care because she is suicidal and making preparations to act (e.g. suicide note, noose in closet) AND taking action (5mg Ativan and 4 beers could be a lethal combo, keep monitoring her breathing). 

At this point, residential treatment is not the best for your girlfriend. Please take her to an ER or call 911. Walden Behavioral Care in Waltham has an inpatient eating disorder unit as well as an inpatient psychiatric unit. The ER can help coordinate transfer to Walden. [https://www.waldeneatingdisorders.com/locations/massachusetts-locations/inpatient/](https://www.waldeneatingdisorders.com/locations/massachusetts-locations/inpatient/)

All the best to you and your girlfriend.

Edit: grammar"

bostoncollege,eztopuk,t1_ezrm209,1568135215.0,Hi! The one piece of advice I would give is to emphasize why you want to be a nurse and why BC Nursing in your essays.  DM me if you have any questions!
bostoncollege,exc7j05,t3_cryt4l,1566144921.0,"Hi OP, I went to BC for undergrad nursing and am currently in my last year of grad school at BC (studying to be a psychiatric nurse practitioner). The advice you have received in the comments already is spot on. Your stats look fantastic and you are a great candidate for BC. I would definitely apply to CSON then transfer to MCAS if you don't like it rather than vice versa. CSON is far smaller in terms of number of spots available per class.

Nursing school is HARD. It is a ton of work (think of it like med school), but let me tell you I feel so blessed to be a BC nurse. The professors in the nursing school are legit \*amazing\* and they really truly care about you and your success. Additionally you will have the opportunity to learn hands on at some of the best hospitals in the world - I had clinical rotations at Mass General, Brigham & Women's, Boston Children's, Beth Israel, and McLean.

Some of my friends were bio majors/pre-med track, and of course they were busy too and had very challenging coursework. These majors don't have clinical requirements though, so they don't have to work in hospitals 8+ hours a day 1-2x a week on top of regular classes like student nurses do. FYI nursing clinical rotations start sophomore year, 2nd semester.

If you have any other questions, feel free to PM me. Bottom line, if your heart is in nursing, go for it!"

bostoncollege,ev9i3xm,t3_cipyxs,1564322381.0,I lived in a single on the first floor of Duchesne West. They’re nice. It never felt cramped to me. I’ve never seen a single on Upper so don’t know how they compare.
bostontrees,eu20x92,t1_ety0lfx,1563379898.0,Just came to say thank you for this. I've been waiting for a month to have my renewal registration processed. I called today and waited on hold for 30 minutes before seeing your comment. I sent an email and literally my registration was processed within an hour.
boston,et9j0rr,t1_et9iii3,1562598083.0,Of course. No such thing as too many crop tops. =D
boston,et9hx6a,t3_cala91,1562597324.0,"26F here - your summer fashion choices will fit right in. Love me some crop tops and high waisted shorts. You should check out Brandy Melville on Newbury St. if you want to add to your crop top collection. I would definitely consider bringing a jacket to uni lectures just in case the air conditioning is blasting. 

Hope you have a fantastic time here!!!"
boston,essye0q,t1_essgvh8,1562259522.0,"I don’t know? The sergeant was literally screaming at us hundreds of people to get on a bus in order to get any information, period.  I wasn’t expecting to wait an hour after getting on the bus to see the guy, but I am not complaining because he came on and told us we could get our cars and get the fuck out of there if we wanted. He was very kind and I have nothing bad to say about the first responders. But like I said I got much more info from the local news than anyone who was actually there. 

What are you talking about- the holiday? None of this occurred on July 4. Building management was not even trying to find us alternate housing. The buses were just to sit on until the school across the street opened.

Edit: I hope I don’t come off as rude. It was just a very frustrating situation. I am very relieved to be back home and so is my cat. Happy 4th to you."

Hope you’re somewhere safe now and we can go home tonight!"
boston,espcoet,t1_espa4d1,1562182333.0,Good guess but it’s actually Mediate Management Company for the next 4 days and then a brand new management company takes over (Dartmouth Group). This whole situation is such a lovely going away / welcoming present for the both of them.
boston,esozuw3,t3_c8qlyb,1562176798.0,"I’m one of the miserable tenants of this building. It was an absolute shitshow being woken up by the fire department at 2 am, told to evacuate the building, then told to get on an MBTA bus and wait for a police update. It wasn’t till 3 am that the sergeant got on my bus with an update. Initially they said it’d be at least 2 hours until the building would be safe for re-entry. We quickly learned that was total bullshit. 

Thankfully my unit is on a floor above the water damage and I could get my car from the garage and escape the madness. I feel so bad for innocent tenants who won’t be able to go home tonight or anytime soon thanks to some dumbass who thought he could change a faucet in the middle of the night. 

The building staff isn’t answering the phone so I have no idea when we can go back. I am getting much more info from the local news than I did from anyone on site. 

Pray for us."
