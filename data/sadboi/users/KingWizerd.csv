gtaonline,fr0jaiz,t1_fqzyp29,1589797675.0,Disagree I’ve killed griefers with orbital.. it was a group of 3 teaming up to kill me I was somewhat holding my own on foot sniping them and I just decided I’d have fun since it was 3 against 1 I went off radar then to facility and got all three of them in one shot with orbital which was very satisfying and got a message saying I was bad lol
gtaonline,fqzooft,t1_fqykez4,1589771883.0,You can submit a report here : [Submit ticket](https://support.rockstargames.com/categories)  : I submitted mine under online and game progress
gtaonline,fqzmm5r,t1_fqykez4,1589770557.0,I just received a reply from rockstar about 7 hours later which isn’t too bad and they said they can fix it by placing a blank save onto my account

gtaonline,fqyjhfc,t1_fqyj56w,1589749587.0,I guess I should’ve made it clearer it isn’t just about the loss of a character it’s the fact that if I even attempt to go online it shows an error message which I can’t get through in any way unless rockstar deletes my character
gtaonline,fqyj8wk,t1_fqyj56w,1589749473.0,Yep And I can’t just delete it and make another one the game won’t let me it just forces me into single player

memes,fqpc735,t1_fqpb3rf,1589542290.0,On PC epic games store GTA V is free rn
dpdr,fqpaqr8,t3_gjsq9e,1589540952.0,Yes but longer usually for the rest of the day until I can sleep it off and then I wake up feeling decent and I fall back into it I hate it
Dissociation,fqp6lp3,t3_gk1xzw,1589536871.0,Just saying this post isn’t going to do anything. I understand why people make posts like that I mean it helps make it clear if it’s a dissociation symptom or something else depending on people’s answers and it also helps to not feel alone in that experience.
infp,fqp5vvc,t3_gjui2a,1589536141.0,I end imagining some super confident positive relaxed version of myself (I’m the complete opposite) and I’m like yeah that’s how I wanna be!! I like build myself up thinking all I need to do is this and that and then I wake up the next day still tired after sleeping just wanting to do nothing and just remain following the same old patterns I’ve been stuck in for so long.. when will I learn.
TooAfraidToAsk,fqp5lrc,t3_gk1zkq,1589535850.0,I definitely do and like others have said I wonder if it is really healthy.. for me it usually builds up more and more and it’s like I’m feeding this negativity inside of me I just keep feeding it and I never have a release for any of it so it feels like it just ends up being inflicted on myself.. anytime I fantasize about any such thing it just feels like I’m tearing my own self down and I end up feeling like shit.. but if I build others up in my head and imagine positive things about them I seem to feel a lot better and more open.. it’s weird how powerful our imaginations are.
HumansBeingBros,fqp567m,t3_gjyeye,1589535407.0,He seemed surprised that he wasn’t dead
selfimprovement,fqocwnm,t1_fqo4c5x,1589512439.0,So what if he did? You don’t have to give him one just keep scrolling to something else.. I mean in the end it’s a free fucking upvote that takes a tap of your finger and you lose nothing from giving one lol
dpdr,fql5e1b,t1_fqkrih0,1589446842.0,Well to me you are saying with dp dr you perceive everything in an objective way but I just feel the complete opposite.. for me dp dr feels like a heavy dense cloud of worries of judgments directed towards myself and a lot of distortions I don’t feel like I see anything objectively my mind is filled with uncertainty and paranoia and I constant misjudge everything.. I have a lot of self hatred and anger and fear all of these distort reality so I can’t see it objectively at all.. But I do feel like I’m distanced from reality and I can sort of observe things but I wouldn’t say in an objective way it just feels like the opposite.. I’d say the majority of people can’t see reality objectively because our minds just automatically place judgement upon everything.. our emotions and thoughts paint reality and for me I’d say I feel completely lost in my little bullshit reality.. idk I am not arguing that you cannot see reality objectively because of dp dr but I’m just explaining how it is for me. I think what happened with me and how I started experiencing dp dr was a bit different.. I had some traumatic events occur and I don’t think I could handle them.. I isolated and I think I began creating a fake reality within my own head one that felt better and one that could let me escape all of the pain and bullshit that comes with life.. it’s impossible really to avoid facing reality and the more you run away from it the worse you will feel.. you build a world of lies and illusions and reality doesn’t stop hitting you. Idk.. to make things short life is fucking weird man lol
dpdr,fqkgdf9,t3_gi8qsj,1589426714.0,I feel the complete opposite

infp,fq98822,t3_ghi866,1589189141.0,I wish that was true but I feel like my anxiety is visible like you could look at me and just see how fucking terrified I am which is of course weird to people so I do seem to draw attention because of how anxious I get and then I start acting even weirder and more anxious and it only gets worse until I can just get away from everything

Cringetopia,fpzp8ei,t1_fpy8f1b,1589021540.0,Listen dude I’m not defending him but he wasn’t 24 when he did whatever with an underage girl he just turned 24 so at least get your fax right homie

Dissociation,fpxtscb,t3_gfxi9m,1588989423.0,This is the one thing I rarely see talked about when it comes to dissociation.. it’s like I want to get better but at the same time there’s still a huge part of me that actually would rather stay dissociated because there’s some things that are good about it.

Dissociation,fppl1dl,t3_ge2o67,1588804248.0,Amazing song one of the only songs to speak about dissociation directly
dpdr,fppd5p6,t3_gdvfxk,1588800128.0,Sorry for not responding I’ve been living in my imagined hell trying to figure out if it’s a reality or not and trying to relax and breathe even tho I can’t seem to relax even if I take deep breaths and I’ve been sleeping all day because I’m so tired of experiencing life and I’ve completely given up on myself and everything so I simply just don’t give a fuck about life anymore and I feel like you probably forgot about me and hate me anyway and I also have extreme trust issues so talking to anyone or hanging with anyone is hard already because I feel like everyone wants to hurt me but anyway I’m sorry for not answering.
howtonotgiveafuck,fpp2tnm,t1_fpom3jd,1588794973.0,I do agree though they could’ve done a better job with that one lol
howtonotgiveafuck,fpnhq3h,t1_fpn79o4,1588763277.0,It gave me a laugh but once again what it is saying applies to this as well.. it’s just saying you could fall and someone laughs and you could think “oh my god I’m stupid” or “I made someone laugh and uplifted their mood”

spirituality,fpn9ab7,t1_fplnh28,1588754723.0,I just made a comment about how through questioning I didn’t really gain anything at all and then I read this comment.. nice :)
spirituality,fpn96el,t1_fplfvnl,1588754610.0,People always say questioning is the beginning of awakening but I disagree because through my questioning I have gained nothing but more and more questions I haven’t got any real answers for all of the questions that I have.
news,fpn85ae,t1_fpn60zj,1588753560.0,They suspected he stole stuff so that’s what I’m talking about
news,fpmrhz0,t1_fpmqrtk,1588739812.0,It was literally so unnecessary.. there’s a thousand different ways that situation could’ve been handled without someone having to be shot dead.
dpdr,fpivb9p,t1_fp9n3wn,1588649557.0,Dude the one thing all of you who keep saying solipsism don’t get is that WE FEEL THIS WAY we aren’t structuring our life and thoughts and beliefs this way we just FEEL like we are the only ones because of our mental illness.. dp dr anxiety ect.. you honestly can’t even bring up solipsism.. sure it relates to this but that’s still not what this is.
Dissociation,fpimgos,t3_gdm3lb,1588643976.0,Well there’s no difference really because depersonalization is dissociation it is a form of dissociation.. dissociation is a broad term that encompasses everything from daydreaming to feeling numb and disconnected to dissociative identity disorder.. there’s a spectrum of mild to extreme forms of dissociation.
dpdr,fp32dw0,t3_gau1y7,1588271913.0,I always joke about it tho when someone says my name I’ll just respond with who? Idk who that is. Lol.

dpdr,fnhjmwz,t3_g1izuf,1586963627.0,I have those moments where I feel completely paralyzed as in I’m basically physically frozen and my body becomes tense.. for me it’s always really scary thoughts that have to do with others so what helps me the most is just getting away for awhile.. I like to go to a place where I completely alone and just watch videos and listen to music and usually there I feel much more at ease.. although it isn’t really all that healthy because I need human interaction but i avoid it so much just because of the fear.
dpdr,fnc08r6,t1_fn8s70t,1586825900.0,Damn.

dpdr,fmsa79o,t3_fx3vmb,1586350897.0,I feel you.. I literally just don’t care anymore.. someone told me that’s a pretty negative way to be and my response is I don’t care.
