Of a recent antibody tests experiment of medical staff in the city, only 11% of them were public transit users, while a larger majority drove in cars, showing that there is no higher risk inherent in taking the train (now that the mask policy is in place)

nyc,fps20mj,t1_fps01vt,1588866145.0,Where are your sources for this? Almost every country that has past their peak has prevented a second wave even as society starts to reopen.
nyc,fps1tqb,t1_fprya4n,1588866054.0,"Same in downtown Brooklyn. About 90% wearing masks, but people arent afraid to walk by eachother on the sidewalk. I think it's because we've made it through the worst, and it appears that simple social distancing and masks indoors is still resulting in less spread. As long as we keep the masks up, I think things should keep going well."
nyc,fps1feb,t1_fps05q4,1588865865.0,"Yeah my relatives on the west coast envision NYC as some kind of wasteland apocalypse right now. I'm actually fine with that, if it means less people travel here in the near-term. Things are looking pretty good for our infection rate, I'd rather us stabilize with our normal population before re-taking tourists again."
nyc,fps0yjy,t1_fps0j3y,1588865639.0,"My wife and I were talking about this yesterday. NYC is doing much better than most of the country with curbing the spread. Lots of people who fled the city in March are going to see that and feel okay to come back, but meanwhile the states they are in have rising infection rates, protesters, and businesses violating lockdown. I almost WANT us to go into full regional quarantine mode, not to keep us in, but to keep others OUT hahaha..."
Anxiety,fprrfqy,t1_fprqugj,1588860580.0,New Zealand pretty much. They are crushing it.
Anxiety,fppfu57,t1_fppd5wg,1588801502.0,Congrats!! That’s huge at this time.
nyc,fpp354t,t1_fpnlodz,1588795130.0,You could get a zipcar or something and drive up and say hi to your family in their driveway?
nyc,fpp2zx7,t1_fpn1auy,1588795059.0,"I was a wreck the last two weeks of March. Couldn't focus at all at work. Anxiety attacks almost every day. Around mid april there was a shift. I, like you, reached acceptance and started to lean into my new routine. I started learning piano. I started doing yoga. I started a new book that I really love about early NYC. Also, for what it's worth, our region is doing the best out of the country regarding data-driven decisions and actually reducing the spread. So while we were hit the hardest, it almost feels safer here in NYC than elsewhere. 

I know it will be a while before things are better and ""normal"". But until then, I'll keep trying to look for the good in life. I know I'll still have hard days (today was one), but life goes on, there are still reasons to live and to smile. I look forward to our city-wide applause at 7pm every night."
