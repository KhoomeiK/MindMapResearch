Doctor Who is a show that's been going on for more than 55 years, it's absolutely crazy that something that went through the hands of hundreds of people is still here today, and that's because it's just layers of lore and stories added together to give us a great show.

Except sometimes, when the pile is too high, adding one thing will crumble the rest and everything will fall down. This is why I'm always open to some cleaning up, some ""controlled destruction"", to set up the ground for new stories to come.

Look at it this way. If the Time War went the way it went according to RTD, we wouldn't have had season 9. If the Daleks really were who they were, then we wouldn't have had a lot of Daleks stories. If the Time Lords really are who we think they are since decades, it's just locking the door to possibly endless opportunities"

What a great first episode for the writer, she was absolutely fantastic and truly juggled with everything quite nicely.

The episode was split in 2 well balanced parts, the first one being full of spookiness and mystery, and the second one being threatened by the lone cyberman. I feared, when I saw the cyberman arrive, that the episode would end 10 minutes after that, but no, it had another 25 minutes to go on and bloody hell did it do it well.

13 was definitely at the top of her game, giving some  nice speeches about what it is for her to face this all, alone.

Now obviously, it wasn't all pink and great. Companions, although well used when used, weren't used a lot. Ryan small talk about his nan's way of living was great, as was Yaz's talk in the corridor, but it was all we got from them. A few bits of dialogue bothered me (the ""rule"" part from the begining) but apart from that it was a solid episode, giving vibes of different eras (a bit of ""Hide"", and a bit of ""Blink"")

Solid 9/10 for me"

But that's the second time in one season where the threat essentially comes down to us fucking up (we polluted the oceans, and now these humanoids-whose-names-we-dont-know-because-who-cares came here to test on us) and it's not really executed well. Seeing what Chibnall has delivered this season and as he was only a co writer, I don't know what's of him and what's of Pete, but it's either a come back to season 11, or (and that's what I believe) it's just a mistake, as all episodes can't be equally great. (By the way, did they just forget that boy from Madagascar on the beach?) 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm all in for raising awareness on the situation we currently are in, but not this way. Please, could we have the aliens or the Doctor stop lecturing us on our misdeeds, and actually save the world or other planets. You know, that thing the whole show was about and that we have only seen once, Gallifrey.

Now it wasn't a pain in the ass to watch, some of the funny bits made me chuckle or even crack up (""it's comming from the other side of that wall"" *Yaz turns the device 180°* ""From the other side of that door""), and overall the side characters, although to numerous, and quickly gone, were pleasant. The split of the TARDIS team really brang something, a sympayhic dynamic.

gallifrey,fe4ua5t,t3_ensr61,1578862817.0,"Okay, so. That's the first time an episode is doing this to me but it's... Good ? Bad? Weird? I can't really tell.

In general, I liked the episode. One thing I've noticed was how dialogue was arguably better. Graham was pure comedy for quite a few times, but it just felt... Off. The hopper virus. In 40 seconds, we learn about it's existence, get it to contaminate Ryan, learn it's probably gonna kill him, then see the Doctor save him. It's great, a virus able to hide in and contaminate everything. But we saw it 40 seconds, and then as a deus ex machina right at the end.

More importantly, the bits that should have been longer (Doc and Drag leader, hopper virus) were too short, and the parts that should've been shorter (the truck) were too long. Acting wise, it's still perfect, finally a child that doesn't look like it's trying to hard or ruining it, Lil boy was pretty funny (also, theory wise, am I the only one seeing something with that ""bye, Doctor"" at the end? Like it's meaning something? Cause I don't actually remember her presenting herself to him)

For the message now. When I got the reveal that we were on earth, I truly stopped breathing for a second. I really liked the idea of these... Things being what humanity would be like, especially after the little speech the doctor made at the end about how humanity always has the choice and can adapt (even more especially since our planet is fucking burning right now), and even if the doc missed an opportunity to have a grandiose speech when Bella (?) asked why she would take orders, it was great. Simply, in the end, the team gets back on the TARDIS, it feels like we've watched them for 50 minutes for nothing, as nothing's changed for em. 


So yeah, in the end, I can't say I didn't enjoy it, cause I would be lying. But I don't really understand where to put it. But since it was a pleasure as a dialogue, I think I'd rate it 6.5 or 7 our of 10 (obviously, all of this is just my opinion)"

Even during the game I lost I was still having fun and wanted to try (which, at some point during last season, left me completely. Had we lost a point no one would've the motivation anymore)

The ambiance in the team was way better as well (which I guess is linked to the fact that you play what you want and you don't have to play something you don't want because there were already 2 or 3 ppl in your role) and I had way more communication in voice chat than ever before, no flaming, no ""I'm doing all the job"". The closest I got to ""toxicity"" was at one point my fellow tank going ""dunno if that matters but, I've got pretty much all gold medals"".

Look at Voledmort. He's got style, is powerful, scary, has a whole story against the protagonist... You can even root for him depending on what you want.

Umbridge's really just a petty bitch who does everything she possibly can to annoy harry and his friends. So I guess it's that ^^"
asoiafcirclejerk,ewu71sh,t1_ewsccpo,1565767271.0,"Write that screenplay. I for one will absolutely read it. I hope you know how to write a screenplay cause the amount of people on freefolk who think that it's as easy as putting an adjective in front of something is frankly scary and very disappointing for anyone who is even slightly interested or involved in screenwriting (a group which I belong to). 

Truth is, you are currently referring to the story, not the writing. You'd have liked a version where they thought about the corpses being raised, that's absolutely understandable. Now tell me where they'd have put the civilians who can't fight. Outside of the city? Inside a secret room we'd never heard of before and that would come as a deus ex machina for saving everyone? And what would it have changed? If they went out of the city, they would have needed some escorts to be sure not to be trapped. Which would have lowered the amount of men able to fight. 

You see, changing a single thing such as ""not putting civilians in the crypts"" can have repercussions on the whole episode, if not more. Try and make THAT coherent and you'll see. There's a reason while not only them but most s screenplays are written over the course of years. 

Finally, we're not defending D&D on what they did. I said it, I'd have liked to have plenty of stuff changed or done differently. I'm defending them for the fact that they god dammed did it, all that for ending up with a bunch of whiny kids who think they'd have done better than them."
asoiafcirclejerk,ewr8wli,t3_cprh0r,1565698737.0,"For god sake these guys kill me. Bro go and write a single chapter of a book, a simple 5 minutes of a screenplay, draw 3 pages of a graphic novel and you'll see how exhausting it really is to write. I'd love them to understand how writing isn't just writing. It's everything from imagining and outlining (which was done by GRRM until later seasons, so that added even more to what D&D had to do) to plotting, writing, rewriting, rerewriting (repeat till you get something not so awful) and editing.

So yeah, I don't think this season was perfect. It had flaws, I'd have liked some stuff to be changed and I was really disappointed by how the death of Daenerys was handled. But these two guys god dammed wrote something like 7 or 8 hours of the show that is considered as the most popular ever."
