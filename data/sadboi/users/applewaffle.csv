AskReddit,f8ajtzi,t1_f8ae8k8,1574399501.0,"Why should someone who tried to end their life take away an organ from someone who is trying to live?

ETA: 
Those who destroyed organs due to drugs/alcohol or from suicide attempts should of course still have a chance, but those who were born with an illness or had an unfortunate accident should come first."
AskReddit,f8aixnp,t1_f8aijuq,1574398683.0,"Despite the depression they still know that their lifestyle choice is destroying their organ. They have the choice to choose another coping mechanism.

What if the extremely skilled surgeon doesn‚Äôt learn his lesson and destroys his new organ, that could have gone to someone who would have taken care of it? You would think an extremely skilled surgeon would know the risks involved with smoking/drinking, so why would he deserve that new organ in the first place? 

Bottom line I still believe that someone who didn‚Äôt actively do anything to harm themselves deserves a second chance before someone who CHOSE to destroy themselves. Regardless of age, race, sex, wealth, status, etc."
