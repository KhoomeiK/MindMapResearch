ETA: 
Those who destroyed organs due to drugs/alcohol or from suicide attempts should of course still have a chance, but those who were born with an illness or had an unfortunate accident should come first."
AskReddit,f8aixnp,t1_f8aijuq,1574398683.0,"Despite the depression they still know that their lifestyle choice is destroying their organ. They have the choice to choose another coping mechanism. 

I do understand what you are saying, though. It really is a difficult subject, because there are just so many scenarios that come into play. I genuinely wish everyone could be happy and healthy. Everyone deserves the chance to live a full life (ya know, except the truly evil humans)."
AskReddit,f8aik39,t1_f8ahcfi,1574398350.0,"Also, those who were born with “life ending defects”, and lived despite the odds, how are they less deserving? If anything they would be more deserving of a new healthy, functioning organ. More so than the skilled surgeon who knowingly destroyed theirs."
AskReddit,f8ai3ns,t1_f8ahcfi,1574397960.0,"Valid point.  Unfortunately nothing is black and white. 

What if the extremely skilled surgeon doesn’t learn his lesson and destroys his new organ, that could have gone to someone who would have taken care of it? You would think an extremely skilled surgeon would know the risks involved with smoking/drinking, so why would he deserve that new organ in the first place? 

Bottom line I still believe that someone who didn’t actively do anything to harm themselves deserves a second chance before someone who CHOSE to destroy themselves. Regardless of age, race, sex, wealth, status, etc."
