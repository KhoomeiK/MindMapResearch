Guy nervously trying to move into the shoes of DM for a mini campaign, just wondering how long curse of strahd is? I'm looking for a campaign that can be finish in 4-8 sessions that are 4 hours each. If its way to long is it easy enough to lop off parts?

Is any lovely typist around to shorten/abbreviate the text on ""Staff of the Woodlands"" so I can fit it inside the TINY magic item box on a automated character sheet I use?  

The full text is as follows if this helps anyone do the task for me:

*  Requires [Attunement](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Magic%20Items#h-Attunement) by a [Druid](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Druid#h-Druid)  

* This staff can be wielded as a magic [Quarterstaff](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Quarterstaff#h-Quarterstaff) that grants a +2 bonus to [Attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Attack) and [Damage Rolls](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Damage%20and%20Healing#h-Damage%20Rolls) made with it. While holding it, you have a +2 bonus to spell [Attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Attack) rolls.  

* The staff has 10 [Charges](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Magic%20Items#h-Charges) for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended [Charges](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Magic%20Items#h-Charges) daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical [Quarterstaff](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Quarterstaff#h-Quarterstaff).  
Spells: You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff's [Charges](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Magic%20Items#h-Charges) to cast one of the following [Spells](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells#h-Spells) from it, using your spell save DC: [Animal Friendship](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Animal%20Friendship#h-Animal%20Friendship) (1 charge), [Awaken](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Awaken#h-Awaken) (5 charges), [Barkskin](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Barkskin#h-Barkskin) (2 charges), [Locate Animals or Plants](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Locate%20Animals%20or%20Plants#h-Locate%20Animals%20or%20Plants) (2 charges), [Speak with Animals](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Speak%20with%20Animals#h-Speak%20with%20Animals) (1 charge), [Speak with Plants](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Speak%20with%20Plants#h-Speak%20with%20Plants) (3 charges), or [Wall of Thorns](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Wall%20of%20Thorns#h-Wall%20of%20Thorns) (6 charges).  

* You can also use an action to cast the [Pass without Trace](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Pass%20without%20Trace#h-Pass%20without%20Trace) spell from the staff without using any [Charges](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Magic%20Items#h-Charges).  

* Tree  Form: You can use an action to plant one end of the staff in fertile  earth and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy tree.  The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its  branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears  ordinary but radiates a faint aura of [Transmutation](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells#h-Transmutation) magic if targeted by [Detect Magic](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Detect%20Magic#h-Detect%20Magic). While touching the tree and using another action to speak its [Command](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Command#h-Command), word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff."

I've been playing a Ghostwise Halfling Druid in a couple of 5e one-shots and its been fun. For our long term campaign my GM wants to be a bit more strict with the Rules As Written which I don't have a problem with. The MAJOR issue I'm having though is, ""how can I satisfy the verbal spell component if my character is mute?"" My DM didn't say I needed to switch characters or anything, but instead that we need to find a way to allow me to cast spells without a voice.

My two ideas so far are:

1. Take find familiar and use a Raven's ""Mimicry"" to say the words for me
2. Use a simple musical instrument for spell casting like Link in Ocarina of Time.

So the PCs recently invaded the swamp of the great mother and defeated a powerful demon that was trying to corrupt the swamp. They killed a lot of lizard folk that were in service to the Greatmothet and her order. Ultimately the order decided not to pursue the PCs because even though we killed many Lizard folk and an up and coming member of their order we defeated the bigger threat to the Greatmother that was the demonlord.

Nesrinn, Dragonborn Paladin of Tiamat, then left the swamp to follow these adventurers back to waterdeep with mixed feelings and has been keeping an eye on them to see if they are a threat to the Greatmother."
