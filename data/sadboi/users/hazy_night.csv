Back in the 1800s- 1900s medical professionals knew jackshit about women's bodies or health. They thought women could get something called Hysteria where her uterus would travel in her body and causes symptoms like crying, irritation, combativeness, fatigue and more. To cure the hysteria doctors would give women a pelvis message until she got a 'release' (i.e. orgasm). Doing these in doctor offices took too long so the vibrator was made to quicken the process. Eventually, women could buy it for themselves and use it at home. There was a time Sears catalog sold vibrator right beside microwaves, toasters, etc."
