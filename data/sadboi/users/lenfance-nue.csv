i can see how it’s frustrating to have a new sibling thrusted in your life, and i don’t know your family, but it’s clear you are hella entitled. i mean this is classic only child behavior where you think you don’t have to share anything and you want all the attention and that’s pretty shitty. and it’s you’re the one assuming you are not enough for your parents (which i doubt is true) and you are the insecure one who doesn’t want to include your sister, who obviously just wants to have a loving relationship with you. and what you said was disgusting and uncalled for. that is not an appropriate thing to say in ANY situation. how do you think she feels not being born into a family that didn’t want her, and when she finds a new family her sibling hates her? yeah... talk to your parents and go get therapy."

depression,fg5p38q,t3_ex17o6,1580533889.0,You just commented on my post and yeah we definitely feel the same way. I feel like depression for me is something that I feel either makes me unique or it’s something to blame all my problems on. Without it I am just a normal functioning human that has responsibilities that I have to be accountable for and it sucks
infp,f9iwdyy,t3_e55xvr,1575347764.0,"You seem just like me when I was 16. High school really sucked for me and I always felt like I never belonged or fit in, even though I had friends, and because we look to everyone else for validation when we're young, it is hard to be satisfied with ourselves and our lives. My advice is, if you want to make changes in your life you shouldn't doubt yourself because if you work at it you can do it. And by having the hope that you can make a bright future for yourself you can really start to appreciate the present and the things you already have in your life. And by living with a good disposition and spreading positivity to others, you can find true fulfillment which will surely bring more self love and love for what is around you. And trust me, in a couple of years you will be so surprised by how much self growth you have made, even if it seems your life is stagnant."
