Sims4,fplfvkj,t1_fpl0zx3,1588711969.0,Yeah that would be nice! I downloaded a bunch of lots off the gallery to try to give the outdoor retreat more life and as much as I do like it and have fun there I do get why people say it‚Äôs not that good/not much to do etc. I wish we could live in both of these vacation worlds.
Sims4,fplexob,t1_fplbrlo,1588711495.0,"Yay! I usually download off the gallery because I‚Äôm a terrible builder and I just can‚Äôt find what I‚Äôm looking for for my get famous sim. She lives alone and is very rich (no budget). I would love her to live in one of the larger lots in Del Sol Valley. I love the 64x64 or whatever it is but there‚Äôs barely any I could find on the gallery and filling it is hard so I‚Äôd be happy to move her to a smaller one but preferably still top right of Del Sol Valley but doesn‚Äôt matter really. She‚Äôs a famous actor/party girl that loves house plants but would happily live in a modern house, rustic house, boho/hippy themed house, anything. I play on ps4 and the packs I have are Get Famous, Get Together, Island Living, Seasons, City Living, Realm of Magic, Vampires, Outdoor Retreat, Laundry Day and Perfect Patio! :) would love love love a nice laundry room or even a nice pool or water themed outdoor area. Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è EDIT: I‚Äôve looked through your responses and houses for others and they are amazing!!! I would love to be able to build like that."
