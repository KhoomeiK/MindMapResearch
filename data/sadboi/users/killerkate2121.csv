Arkansas,fqxsifx,t3_gli4si,1589737165.0,"A lot of people support Dillard's stance during these crazy times. I'm sorry you disagree with their decision making in the process but they are breaking absolutely no laws returning to regular business. If it bothers you enough, you should pursue work elsewhere. There are quite a few local places who are being strict with their guidelines you may feel safer at. Like was stated above though, they are all just guidelines and recommendations, not laws.They are in the right in their own way, as you are in the right being uncomfortable. There is no right answer. 
And Dillards is not the boogeyman everyone is making them out to be. 
You have the choice to move on to an establishment you agree with. Hope you find that."
HighStrangeness,fqwaae5,t1_fqw21ml,1589697516.0,I wonder if you blocked it out due to trauma from actually being terrified during these encounters? Then moving away somehow helped your psyche process them and remember? That's wild. I've had similar things happen to me and my family.

DreamInterpretation,fpqwir4,t1_fpqvzuh,1588834365.0,"I actually don't think it's as deep as the guy above said. As a female whose had sex dreams about exs, it's usually because she still wants to fuck, and by texting and telling you seeing maybe if that's an option? 
Not always of course, and I could be wrong and she is just as comfortable enough and confused enough to open up and tell you. 
But if I dream about fucking my ex, and text him to tell him (or any guy I dream about fucking) it's because there's some repressed desire there coming out in my subconscious during sleep and I'm gonna see if that's plausible the next day while navigating those emotions...if that makes sense."

Thetruthishere,fim781n,t3_f8e62u,1582520177.0,"Okay I just want to chime in. I am behind on making my own post but I want to say they are 100% real. 
The first time I had am experience I was still in high school. We didn't have cell phones with internet on them like we did today so I couldn't 'google' what I had just seen until years later. 
First encounter I was in my bedroom, trying to sleep because I had school in the morning. Something made the hair on my arms and neck stand up so I sat up and saw this shadow man in the left corner of my room in front of my bookshelf. He wasn't solid, he wasn't opaque, he was literally like defined smoke. No facial features, and mine wasn't wearing a hood like some experienced. Just the literal black outline of a shadowy man. He came closer to me and I started to throw pillows at him until he reached the side of my bed, stuck his hand out towards my face, and I literally remembered trying to bite where his hand would be, but passed out and woke up the next morning to pillows all over my floor. I was extremely distraught and before that I was not someone who experienced a lot of night mares, but after that I was plagued with them.
Fast forward to years later in my old apartment I had my first sleep paralysis and woke up to one holding me down. This one though was different to me, he was bigger. Scariest moment of my entire life since it was my first I suppose. Now I have sleep paralysis regularly, especially if I lucid dream and always seem to see them in the middle phase. 
My most recent shadow encounter was less than a month ago at my new house. I was lucid dreaming, realized that something else knew I was, freaked out and tried to wake myself up to avoid another encounter, got stuck and woke up to one choking me. This one had smoke as a face. I finally moved and he moved as fast out of my room as smoke could move. Called my husband and still get scared to fall asleep. 
I've never been a drug user, especially not in high school with my first account. Pot at most in college and these days my worst vice is a glass of wine when the kids are down for bed.
My thing is..people who say this is a hallucination, how is it that so many people who don't know each other, have never heard of such things, all experience this same mass hallucination? Literally people all over the world who don't know each other from adam. 
What are they? Where do they come from? I tend to think we do exist on some multidimensional plane some cross over, or exist at different frequencies. Then I wonder why are some benign, and why are some aggressive like the ones I've been so luckily stuck with. Lol. 
I never discount a story (unless is absolutely ludacris) because honestly life is weird. Theres so much we don't know. 
I just so badly someone who did know would just tell us, so we can get on top of it. 
My experiences have honestly messed with my life especially at certain times. I'd give anything to know the answer of who they are and how to handle them to be honest. 
Thanks for sharing your story. Funny how your mom tried to rationalize that maybe it was in her imagination but once she heard you her gut told her she was right. I wonder how much stuff we miss by rationalizing those things before truly knowing."
