I want to stress that you should not accept your GP's answer to your concern if you feel there is something going on. There are other tests that can be done to see check your hormone levels, not just for acromegaly. If your insurance allows it I'd find an endocrinologist in your network and schedule an appointment with them. If your insurance requires a referral then try to get one from your GP. I wish I knew what to ask and say earlier, so you're one step ahead. I had a similar GP to yours, who just ordered basic tests and swept me under the rug with my complaints. Then when I switched, at my very first appointment, she asked if I knew about acromegaly. She was very astute.


Based off my limited knowledge, and not being a doctor, some of these symptoms could possibly be acromegaly-related, but some other ones really don't seem to fit. So I strongly encourage you to not pigeonhole yourself into thinking you have acromegaly (as bias as I am: you don't want this). Best of luck in figuring everything out!"

FA30plus,fdfsf4h,t1_fdfs5d3,1578369049.0,"That is completely understable. It now sounds like she might be taking advantage of the situation then. Sometimes you have to put yourself first, and what's best for you. No shame in that."
FA30plus,fddrwvg,t1_fddrv5w,1578322391.0,"Thanks, that's all I can offer someone on the internet. üëç"
medizzy,fddiyri,t3_ekk3g2,1578314163.0,That is disgustingly cool.
FA30plus,fddiu14,t3_ekos4j,1578314018.0,"I just wanted to chime in and say, if any woman disregards you because you live with your mom TO HELP HER, they aren't worth your time anyway."
MadOver30,fd2jfr3,t1_fd263yb,1578148096.0,"I thought your response was wonderful. I think the best way I can describe myself is as a heavy rain cloud. I'm still floating, but I'm losing part of myself too. I can feel certain one moment and utterly lost a second later.

I am trying to focus more on myself. Figuring out what I need and want regardless of others. But I can't help but get lost in other people. Their warmth... not in the thermodynamics sense either, but that they have things figured out to an extent and it gives them this glow. I want to be enveloped in it, and make it grow. I don't know how to stop giving myself away to others, because it's easier to cheer others on than myself. Something I'm working on with my therapist."
MadOver30,fd2h698,t1_fd27q1k,1578147160.0,"I have not seen it, so I'll make a note to check it out."
MadOver30,fd24ssg,t1_fd23tiw,1578141687.0,That's true. A lot of these comments are reminding me of pieces of my past self... before my attempt. I lost that person for several years now. I use to be so much more than just elegiac. Thanks for your comment.
MadOver30,fd1xq8x,t1_fd0u5c8,1578138462.0,"I like this. I will try this, thank you."
MadOver30,fd07vk3,t1_fd06ii3,1578114946.0,"I know you're right, but at the same time that's all I'm doing: telling myself to stop going down that road. It sounds like an excuse, but it's exhausting pulling myself back. I appreciate your kind words though. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
