BPD,fpt6sux,t3_gf28wk,1588885869.0,"I have had a lot of trouble recalling my own face, and at times do not recognise myself in mirrors. I believe this is to do with a lack of self identity.

BPD,fozrsgz,t3_gadzsv,1588195735.0,Well damn if you didn't just describe me to a T..(well I have more wits than a granola bar I hope😂)...I find it scary how how alike we are on this sub some times. Makes me real paranoid that I have no individuality at all and will just express these archetypes over and over!
LushCosmetics,fora37y,t3_g8xpi6,1588008740.0,I'm so jealous! I ordered some stuff on the 19th and my account still doesn't say it has left yet. Getting impatient 😂
BPD,foq5edz,t1_fop799v,1587983626.0,"That's what I meant, it is 'like' mania but isn't mania. Once I looked into it more, I realised that it may only last a few days to a week for me and I am not as extreme. It could possibly be hypomania, though I think it probably needs a different name to differentiate it from Bipolar."
BPD,fooc688,t1_foobqyt,1587936392.0,That's ok. Yes I do experience Mania for a few days at a time and I only have BPD and PDD. I meant that doctors seem not to realise there is a lot of overlap between BPD and Bipolar.
BPD,foo9233,t3_g8k4iw,1587934871.0,"I experience this too, and was the main reason when I was first seeking treatment, I was convinced I had Bipolar. There is a lot of over lap in symptoms I've noticed though the medical community don't like to agree with this."
BPD,fon150n,t3_g889a5,1587909738.0,"I have noticed this is very common for me to. As soon as a bad thought comes up my brain will fixate on it, and I can't get it out. I get the same thing with phrases and music as well."
TwoXChromosomes,fomyao0,t3_g87xd6,1587907481.0,I agree. I've been working from home since the beginning of March and I am enjoying the freedom it has given me. My only problem is that I can't get anywhere to go for a walk to exercise otherwise it would be perfect. I hope I can work from home in the future.
LushCosmetics,foku5z9,t3_g7xgv0,1587849009.0,"That's very impressive, it takes me forever to get enough pots! I feel like for people who have so many pots saved up there should be an option to exchange for something other than a face mask cause you will never use them all in time. Like having 10 pots and you can get some soap or something that will last a little longer."
BPD,fojlue4,t3_g7tkqn,1587824207.0,"I'm one of the BPD people that doesn't experience the FP phenomenon. I become obsessive of characters, books etc but not real people. At least not to the extent others here have expressed. I don't really understand it at all and I am happy for that."
LushCosmetics,fnwszjp,t1_fnwrd9i,1587324847.0,Thanks for sharing. I'm fairly certain I am going to go for it. Of all the solid moisturisers I have tried this is the worst! it just will not spread over the skin. I suspect that the alcohol like scent will die off a little when diluted with the oils but will mix in another essential oil if it doesn't. Did you whip the melted moisturiser and oils once it cooled a little or just leave it as it was?

dysthymia,fk8ci7u,t3_fguqe7,1583953497.0,"I describe it as persistent depressive disorder. This is the official diagnosis I have. And it isn't described as 'low grade'. It is described as persistent depressive symptoms that are ALWAYS present. When you explain it this way, people tend to have more of an understanding. At least that is my experience."
BPD,fjhztqn,t3_fda1fr,1583358103.0,I have this too. I think I'm great one minute and a devil the next. It is most likely both splitting on yourself and a self image thing. A lot of symptoms of BPD blend into each other but it surprises me just how alike a lot of us are in our expression of BPD.
BPD,fje8wvi,t3_fcy6qt,1583267315.0,I understand completely why you are saying and I am 31 years old. I have always had an inner panel of critics that comment my daily activities. The people change from day to day but they are always commenting on me. It is entertaining and also frustrating. It's where my mind wanders to when I'm alone and they always have an opinion.

BPD,fib37jk,t3_f7dula,1582313693.0,"Wow this is exactly how I feel. I am now so numb to the world, I just float through it and barely even register. I was very numb on Venlafaxine, I have moved on to Amitriptyline and I now get intense waves of emotion, but they go very quickly. So I'm mainly numb with very brief intense (as in you feel it physically in the body) emotional episodes."

Fibromyalgia,fgglhor,t3_eyapap,1580764352.0,"Yes this is the same for me. I am in a desk job now but before this I was a very active lab technician and the relentless activity just killed me. My body just gave up. I couldn't make it through the week. It's why I am sceptical around the 'just do mild exercise' thing. I was making at least 15,000 steps a day and I was in so much pain and always on the verge of falling asleep on the spot. I am now able to make it through the week with mild pain/exhaustion. Unfortunately I have now put on weight thanks to dropping the exercise levels down. But that is another barrier to overcome."
BPD,fg4neh8,t3_ewtls8,1580506927.0,100% yes. I live in a constant state of contradiction. Feeling like a piece of shit and also knowing my worth all at the same time. No wonder we are always so confused!

BPD,fd2mofl,t1_fd1t97p,1578149403.0,I mainly look at scientific journals (used to study Genetics so it's an old habit) but have a look at this one as it is more of a review of other studies and will be easier to follow if you aren't used to scientific jargon: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6743631/pdf/ndt-15-2601.pdf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6743631/pdf/ndt-15-2601.pdf)
BPD,fcyy9zz,t3_ejjfz4,1578089746.0,I also hae BPD and Fibromyalgia. It is highly likely that they originate from the same initial source. A lot of reading I have done leads to HPA pathway being disrupted in for both conditions and would lead to both overactive emotional reactive pathways and increased peripheral neural sensitivity. Take a look into it.
Fibromyalgia,fc9bnsq,t3_egiofu,1577550176.0,"I'm like this. I can function most of the time with pain and fatigue, and only get bad flares if I do something extra strenuous. Had to give up being a lab tech as it was too much physical labour and now I do a desk job and get by ok."

SkincareAddiction,fb5ndi4,t1_fb5jmby,1576530811.0,"In the morning and evening, I use Lush tea totaler (an oil based cleanser) followed by either Eurcerin 5% Urea face cream or lush Light Touch serum, which was usually plenty of moisture, and sometimes both if I feel very dry. I occasionally use Lush mask of magnaminity on especially oily days and when it doesn't sting too much on the psoriasis The ordinary glycolic acid toner (but sparingly). I also have some the ordinary Marula oil which I use very minimally as it can cause me to break out if my skin is being extra sensitive. Thanks."
Indiemakeupandmore,fb58hwr,t1_fb490fn,1576522963.0,My current ones that I have done  (a bunch of BPAL imps and one main oil) have worked so well. I genuinely enjoy them more as a spray as I can get them on my clothes and hair easier which holds the scent better.
witchcraft,fal6ab0,t3_e9pik0,1576179119.0,Even when I have no magickal/ritual plans I still manage to look at the sky and marvel at her beauty. In fact it usually catches me off guard and I'm stunned by her. It's the little things.
Indiemakeupandmore,fa5zjm7,t1_fa13mr6,1575819605.0,"From what I've been reading, it is less to do with the concentration of the oil and more to do with how much throw the scent has in the different mediums. On me oils just disappear, but I'm hoping that with the alcohol, the scent will hang around longer on skin and clothes as the alcohol gives better throw. I've only used a small amount of the oil to test so there is plenty left over if it doesn't work very well."
Indiemakeupandmore,fa5yk6t,t1_fa1mfbm,1575819413.0,It's a perfumers alcohol I got from amazon. It  is mostly Ethanol and has a small amount of Isopropyl Myristate and Monopropylene glycol that help with absorbing solubilising the oils.
Indiemakeupandmore,fa10ms4,t1_fa0umu2,1575762904.0,I'm only making 5ml of them at a time so it only needs 1ml of the oil. I wouldn't use the whole thing as I think they last longer as an oil anyway so if they work in the alcohol I plan to make small batches and remake them when they run out.
BPD,f8w2rhy,t3_e2ew3a,1574882178.0,I have the same issue. I'm not the type to start trouble or be loud. So it's assumed that there is nothing wrong with me or that my diagnosis is wrong. It's quite frustrating.

BPD,f6iwi9m,t3_driv97,1572885465.0,"This is exactly how I feel about sex too. I am both hypersexual and sex repulsed, I guess because I can't think of myself in sexual situations so it is difficult for me to be intimate, made even worse because I have a husband with a high sex drive. The joys of BPD."
BPD,f5t20oe,t3_dp0byv,1572448652.0,I was emotionally neglected but it wasn't deliberate. My parents were having a hard time (with my older siblings/their marriage/money) and I as the youngest/quite one just happened to slip into the background. It doesn't always have to be intentional either and my parents are so loving and supportive of me now they realise what happened. Trauma is a very subjective thing.
badwomensanatomy,f5iiqqb,t1_f5ifxtp,1572214907.0,"I can only guess so for myself too (even with that mild traumatic event), though why I was always so uncomfortable around men I'll never know as that was before that anyway. The mysteries of life!"
badwomensanatomy,f5grbue,t1_f5frn57,1572196271.0,"I never had expressions of sex as you did at that age but I was very aware of it from a very young age, as in I knew exactly what sex was and how to do it etc, and also went looking for porn etc from a young age. I started my period at 7 years old (another thing that happens often to girls who experience sexual assault) and yet, I have no memory of overt severe sexual assault. I do remember once when I was around 9 and was assaulted while shopping on my own (man grabbed my boob which were very large for a 9 year old). I don't think this is enough to cause the expression I had so I always wonder if something else happened that I don't remember. It's strange how kids react to trauma.

Edit: I also suffer from BPD."

I am not sure why I can't find a job in a lab (I suppose because it has been a while since I completed my Masters even if I was trying to find a lab job the entire time) but this is one aspect of the job I just can't do and it does narrow my choices greatly."

witchcraft,f2fj3it,t3_dd8jje,1570218495.0,Not remembering sigils is a good thing tbh. Part of activating them and having them work is the process of forgetting them in the conscious mind so that the unconscious can take over. It depends on how you use them of course but most practices tend to favour forgetting the intended meaning.

LushCosmetics,f2b3j43,t1_f279jdi,1570121318.0,So I have finally had a chance to try it out. The scent is unchanged and lingers on the skin nicely.

BPD,f25bodk,t3_dbtmes,1569970564.0,I'm like this a lot. Most of the symptoms of BPD I have are internal (except compulsive spending and self harm). You don't need to be screaming all the time to have BPD. That is a very extreme type  of it and some people are like that but I tend to find more people fall into our category.

BPD,f22dd2i,t3_dbiuc6,1569886785.0,I have the same problem. I'm not sure what causes it. I think it's to do with the 'sense of identity' in that we jump on things we think we are all about and after a while we don't get the same high over it so we look to other things.

dysthymia,f1brfik,t3_d8o3bs,1569341285.0,You took the words right out my mouth here. Positive thinking is just telling ourselves lies and living in a fantasy.

chaosmagick,f19h9pb,t3_d8bvoh,1569272440.0,"I am in the same place you are. I just try to keep myself focused and try not to want it too much. Letting go of the need/want for it and allowing things to fall as they will.  I am currently unemployed and it is not just affecting me financially but also psychologically. None of the magical things I've done have worked other than getting me interviews. I know that eventually I will get something. I think it just takes time and patience. When it comes to depression (which i suffer with really badly), using magic won't work. There isn't a quick fix. Using techniques such as meditation and mindfulness can help, but I'm afraid when it comes to ourselves, we have to put the time in. And also sometimes, depression is simply just something wrong with the brain and you need help righting it, be that medication or therapy. You can try things to help yourself, like sigilising for less stressful things to happen, or for the strength to overcome anxiety. That is more likely to  succeed than just to right out get rid of it. I hope this helps you a bit to know there are others out there like you, and to keep trying both with magic and to overcome your obstacles."
