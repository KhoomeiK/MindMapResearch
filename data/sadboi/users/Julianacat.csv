Sneks,fklsx65,t1_fklqx5c,1584313880.0,"my own personal approach to depression is that it doesn't go that far. unless you were hospitalized for a long period of time you shouldn't hurt your sneks.
your sneks are your babies. 
you would have to literally do nothing, not eat shit or breath to harm them this badly. they are hardy and can survive a week of abuse but this was LOOOONG term.
i love my snakes and would do anything for them. they are my cure for my own depression.
if they are shedding, i make damm sure they have a humidity box(or their enclosure is humid) to help them out. if not a bowl if water.
if they need food i ask the case worker(im mentally ill as well. i have one) to get me some live pinkeys.
depression isn't an excuse if you aren't psychotic.
your snakes are your life. they depend on you. they help you calm down as they aren't a pug scratching on your legs constantly. they are the best pet for u while depressed as they are easy to care for(compared to other ""pets"") and are calm enough to handle when stressed.
please be nice to your snakes. its probably the easiest animal to care for."

schizophrenia,f9fp7dc,t1_f9fnwaf,1575282306.0,"Id say it might be about reality checks.

You see/hear thing, if gf/bf doesnt react or notice it, flag it as not real...

Could end up worse in psychosis tho if it makes u hallucinate the expected reactions from them. 

Can anyone vouch or deny me pls?"
schizophrenia,f9fhx5a,t1_f9fht8w,1575272555.0,"That being said, weed still isnt good for schizophrenics...
If you do fine on it then more power too you, being high is fun!
Just be responsible with the use."
schizophrenia,f9fht8w,t1_f9bhih7,1575272415.0,"It can trigger psychosis in people predisposed or already have schizo that hasn't surfaced yet...
Essentially if u smoked up and caught psychosis AND IT PERSISTS.... you were already doomed to begin with.
Some people report a break of a year+ that clears the schizo but its a small chance... and that means no weed ever again as one hit will send you back into hell...

There are developmental issues yes but its more like it can push your head in the direction of schizophrenia.
Imagine a cliff, if u dont smoke ur a safe distance away... When you do you may take a step or two closer...
if you were close to the edge or you walked close enough to it for another step or two, than life will take the last step for u and boom, schizophrenia."

I was kinda shut in but I talked alot on discord and other places...

Eventually we decided to meet up after a few of my hospital visits where she was with me every step of the way. Im somewhat better now ofc but its because she came to know me and we fell in love!

two, if i cant beat em, join em. i know it sounds curel but i say nice things next to her, not exactly like voices would be but its how i break into her broken mind."
schizophrenia,f7jzykh,t3_dwl5rm,1573790860.0,"thats for you to figure out on your own through experimentation.
you already know when their episodes are coming in, so all you gotta do is pull them back out of it.
say nice things, think about how the things you say could be misinterpeted, try to avoid that, stimulate them in a caring way.

i always give my girlfriend a trigger warnings(because they work for schizo for some reason) whenever i want to talk deep.
when she closes her eyes for too long, it could be an episode. if shes distressed then its probs an episode and its time to help"

schizophrenia,f7g1h2s,t3_dw0guv,1573692110.0,"occasional voices in showers - (kept hearing my gf crying outside so i would run out to help and she wasnt crying at all) visions - (Vivid scenes that im in where i killed my gf in one then myself, in the other im slashing myself with a razor) sleep hallucinations - (I dream but continuously come back to my bed and get tormented constantly... its like theres a demon) 

all these are probably flukes and happen a few times then subside. I think im just misreading how to use my head properly. Diagnosed autistic at 5th-6th grade so its unlikely to be schizophrenia. Still very deathly scary as I see how my lover deals with it. So more than likely im memeing myself into insanity by being paranoid and anxious about symptoms. Read the faq, cyclic anxiety or ocd... im fucked"

Lied to me in my sleep hallucinations so its scary even when shes ""good."" Even threw a pillow at her when she looked like she was from a horror movie(bad idea). Sleep scary ;("
