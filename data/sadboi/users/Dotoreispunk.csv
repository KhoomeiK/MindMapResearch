How much longer do we need to wait for sheeple to wake up and realize these warmongers have no skin in the game and only care about themselves and their own agenda. 

Settling is  out of the question, it's time to call for early election as soon as possible. Even then i'm extremely skeptical at how accurately the numbers will represent the people's will as our lovely government has proven on more than one occasion that they are willing to tamper with the democratic process.

These politicians drunk on delusion and power are the ones who have to be fair and rational, we've given up way more than we can afford and it's time we take back what's rightfully ours.

Politicians should be accommodating the people's needs and desires, not the other way around."

lebanon,fba64lw,t1_fba2vj0,1576666563.0,"Listen here you excuse of a wannabe analyst.

Projecting your cynical and nonconstructive opinion does not make it reality.

You're delusional and drunk on your sub-par sense of superiority.   

Let me make something crystal clear, there's a hierarchy of needs; once you reach a certain point in this hierarchy forsaking certain morals and integrity becomes inevitable. This inevitably resulted in the wide-spread sectarianism, patronage and corrupt institutions.

To that extent, we are faced with a population that has one and only objective to survive no matter the cost, this resulted in the sectarianism/patronage we see today. 

You have 0 support for the people who are finally fighting to right their wrongs and reject these warmongers? I'm actually glad to hear that as your rotten support is irrelevant and might even weigh us down if we had it. 

""Reddit is filled with anti-hezbollah posts which is fueling the fire and justifying actions of these factions""

And I thought you couldn't sound more moronic.

Facts do not care about the feelings or reaction of mindless goons who have forgotten how to think for themselves. (this applies to ALL political parties in Lebanon)

Anyway, your frail and ignorant demeanor may not allow you to have faith in the Lebanese people who have been fighting relentlessly for the past 60 days +;  yet thankfully reality doesn't rely on your toxic and empty words."

Regarding your point on gas masks and dismantling tear gas canisters not working I genuinely don’t know what you’re going on about.
