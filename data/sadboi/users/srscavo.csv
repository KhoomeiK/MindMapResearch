I got my BSW two years ago (today actually) and for as long as I can remember I wanted to work in mental health. I was sure I was strong enough to handle it, despite my own mental health issues. However I worked in a group home for people with mental illness (mostly schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder) for six months and it broke me down. I left the job feeling genuinely mentally scarred and with my faith in what I wanted to do gone. The idea of working in social work (even outside of mental health) makes me panic. I don’t think I can do it again.

So I guess I’m wondering if anyone has any tips. Do I get a masters degree in something else? Do I just try again and hope for the best? I don’t have other interests in different careers so I just feel lost.

Again sorry if this isn’t the right place and needs removed. Thanks"
