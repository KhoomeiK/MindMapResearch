microgrowery,fqgw99m,t1_fqgsxwo,1589359315.0,"Thanks. Ive had my 2x4 for about 2 1/2 years and its held up really well. A few pin hole light leaks here and there but that's to be expected with any canvas tent. When i first got it i remember the zipper being really stiff but it smoothed out in about a week. There's a flap on the inside that covers the zipper when zipped and it helps to fold and crease this back so the zipper doesn't get stuck on it. This is something i also had to do with my new 4x4. Its decent weight canvas for the job.  The floor insert quickly looses its waterproof ability if it sits with water pooled in it but this can be corrected with scotchguard waterproofing spray. I just use a dish under each plant.

One of the main reasons i went with vivosun is the metal corners. A lot of other companies use plastic corner junctions. I have a friend that lost a lot because of a plastic corner junction failure. (tent collapsed in on itself broke his HPS light and started a fire. He lost all plants, half of his house and his car to the fire.) The cross bar on my 4x4 will support 88lbs thanks to the metal corners.

You can easily spend double on a Gorilla tent or similar but even if its the best made, highest quality tent made its still double the price of a tent that will do the job just the same.

With that being said i bought a 2x2x4' tent from topogrow or hydroplus (cheap no name) for $30. The zipper is clunky and often jams. I had to put it in a closet because of the rainbow that shoots out of the zipper with the lights on.

The build quality is good on the Vivosun especially when you considerthe price point compared to others. When i knew it was time to get a 4x4 i knew id get another vivosun because of the durability and price point. They make really good tents and i haven't found a reason to stop using them as of yet. Hope this helps.

edit: side note so you dont make the same mistake i did. Get the tallest tent you can fit in your space. A lot of space is taken up in the top of the tent by the equipment so the taller the better."

bipolar,flxhvcq,t1_flvngjd,1585583203.0,"It may seem like a neutral feeling which to a certain extent it is. However feeling good or bad is still a feeling. I have swings where I land on being purely apathetic. Almost nihilistic. But the fact of the matter is feeling neutral is still feeling. If you are dead you don’t feel nor would you ever feel anything ever again. 

I’ve had a lot of people give me the same “yeah I guess” answer mostly because in general people aren’t equipped to talk someone off a ledge. They haven’t dealt with, struggled with it on a daily basis and most simply have never had to defend an argument for life over death. 

A lot of people just don’t want to say the wrong thing so they say “yeah, I guess” which is saying just more than nothing. If someone is committed ( like truly committed at all cost) to taking their lives the there is little anyone else can do about it. Your life may seem like it sucks right now but taking the opportunity of great feelings from the future is far worse than death. 

I have to choose to not take my own life everyday. Everyday. Sometimes multiple time a day, a hour, a minute. Somedays it’s easier and some days it seems impossible. So I constantly have to remind my self that while the feeling is real, it will pass and I have the power to choose. I have the power of choice. Sometimes it doesn’t feel like you have a choice but that’s just my emotions in my brain telling me I don’t.  Never forget you always have a choice. My argument/point is that you shouldn’t make a permanent decision for a temporary feeling. 

It helps me to write all these feelings down so I can read them after my mood changes as a reminder to myself what my brain will tell me in that mindset. I highly recommend finding a licensed psychotherapist close to you to get the thoughts out of your head. I did for ten years and I can honestly say it’s saved my life more times than I can count. 

Of course if you feel you’ve completely lost any/all control admit yourself to the hospital and tell them you are having suicidal thoughts with plans. I promise you that life is worth living but you have to make the active decision and choice to live it. I wish you the best and a long and happy life."

I’ve always known that depression is a vail that distorts reality and makes us believe we are seeing things clearly for the first time. When in reality, that feeling is nothing more than looking through a badly colored stained glass window and convincing ourselves that it’s not worth looking out the window anymore much less going outside. When a change of perspective would be walking outside to see the world as it is. In those moments I have to change my perspective in order to truly understand and see what great things there are in this world that I don’t want to miss. Things that I have yet to experience. 

Try to change your perspective and do not beat yourself up. Nobody is perfect, we all make mistakes and to compare yourself to an idealistic perfect person only feeds the depression. (What helps me here is staying off social media for a couple days, deleting the apps if I can’t as I can always redownload them) Only when I change my perspective do I come out of a deep suicidal depression state. 

This movie helps me do that. Every time I watch it. Please try to ignore the negative thoughts your mind is telling you about yourself and accept the positive. Most people with Bipolar Disorder will feel more in a day than some do their entire lives. This is why life is worth living. The struggle makes the victories that much more enlightening.

Zero transparency and that’s they way these kinds of politicians want to keep it. That way they can buy and sell Americans for profit. 

Just look at rick Perry. He implemented several bills that protected businesses that engage in predatory lending practices. Ever hear of Lone Star Star Title Loans and Cash America Payday Loans? Perry was one of the majority investors when passing those bills in Texas claiming it was to protect small businesses from frivolous lawsuits. IE: To cover his ass from litigation. He then appointed William White who was VP of several of the largest pay day loan companies in the country to the head of the finance commission including Cash America. One guess as to what that oversees. As if that wasn’t enough Perry was later caught in a radioactive conflict of interest with Rex Tillerson as the head of secretary of energy.

In the video, it appears the man licks a row of deodorant at a Walmart about an hour west of St. Louis. 

The Warrenton Police Department said in a statement Monday that the man was taken into custody and charges were pending through the Warren County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. It was not immediately clear Monday what kind of charges police applied for against the man.

""We have received numerous reports about the video from locals, nearby residents, as well as people from the Netherlands, Ireland, and the United Kingdom,"" the statement from the department said. ""We take these complaints very seriously and would like to thank all of those who reported the video so the issue could be addressed.""
