coincollecting,fmzkrj2,t3_fydbv1,1586523309.0,"It looks like most of them are assorted foreign coins. Coins have what is called ""numismatic value,"" which is value beyond that of their ""face."" To put that another way, a penny is worth one Cent at face value. However, if that same penny has a mint error such as the coveted 1909 S VBD penny, it has  a high numismatic value. U.S. coins generally have the highest value. Foreign coins may have some value, but not much. Also, as a general rule, it's not advised to clean coins, especially if you think they may be on the high value side as this will actually lower that value. That said, low value coins can be cleaned using vinegar as a soaking agent. Just  what it sounds like...put them in a vinegar to soak. Leaving them there too long can cause corrosion. You can also use an acidic pop (soda) like Coca Cola. Rubbing alcohol may be a third option. Again, I'd like to stress that any cleaning of coins may damage them and/or lower their numismatic value so, it's best to make sure you don't want to sell them by having your collection looked at by a professional before any cleaning. 

Edit: Coins may also have sentimental value, which is perfectly fine as long as you understand sentimental value isn't same as numismatic value."
