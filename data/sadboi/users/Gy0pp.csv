depression,fcd2o6i,t3_eh38a7,1577605604.0,"Small steps. That's all. I was scared as well. The idea of putting so much time and dedication into something scared me. The idea of working out in the same place as some huge people who worked for years and judging me for my ugly skinny appearance scared me. But I forced myself. I'm working out for 4 months. And believe it or not I see no difference, its hard to gain weight because I have trouble eating at all (developed some kind of eating disorder because of depression). But people say I look better than before. I don't have specific diet I just try to eat a little bit more than before. You don't have to put all the dedication you have. Go with small steps. Going to the gym doesn't mean you will automatically have to stick to certain food and go to gym almost every day in a week (at least not at the start, unless you really want to push it). Just give it a try. Go for 2-3 days in a week if you are able to. Slowly add it to your routine and make it more comfortable to go there."

I also didn't have to worry how many people are gonna send me any wishes. I didn't have a cake or any sort of party since I remember. I just get money and the same wishes from my family every year.

socialskills,eylxh6i,t3_cxln8s,1567194363.0,"You don't sound like the type to make anyone harm why would these 2 guys don't like you? Also knowing someone in class is a huge advantage and you should use it. If you know them you know who you want to hang out with or feel better to talk to. Hanging out with them is definitely better option but the question is will you be able to do it. You said you are not a social person but outgoing people are really hard to keep up with if you are not as outgoing as them (speaking from experience). Taking things slowly is also a good choice but you need to explain more what do you mean by that. If you wouldn't know who these people are I would think you mean observing people and slowly trying to talk to them, but you know them.

So in short what  I would advice. Don't try to befriend everyone. It may sound stupid but it's better to have a few people with good connection than trying to be on everyone's good side just to be left disappointed or people will use it against you. Also if it's an option definitely hang out with someone. First impression is definitely important it doesn't matter how did they remember you, it's about how you look like now. Try to be confident and social to whatever extent you are comfortable to. Ask them about what they've been up to, teachers or other things. Anything just usual, dumb questions to talk to people to not be left out. Good luck."

If you have sense of humor I'm sure it's gonna work. I always was in classes full of men, maybe a few girls and I was on the same boat when it came to talk to them I was clueless. You just gotta do a little research. Try cheap talk ask about basic stuff with everyone and see who do you enjoy talking with. Don't try to fit everyone, try to find a few girls which you'll be able to talk to."

Advice from me - I think you should go. I know that you may not be ready but you usually start with meds only. If not you should say that to a therapist. I was the same and I tried meds for 2 months before I decided I want a therapy. Maybe after taking them for some time you'll feel a little bit better and have different perspective when it comes to therapy. Good luck my friend.

socialanxiety,ewo2xbu,t3_cp9uvy,1565603172.0,"Huh well it may be bad advice coming from someone who was bullied in school but eventually I used it to fit it (no, I won't recommemd this to you). I can tell what I would do now if I had to do this again and try to avoid that. It doesn't matter how many people attend this school. If you are not some social beast you won't have anything to do with most of them. Focus on creating healthy relationships in your class. And here is the thing. Don't try to do that with everyone. You need to do a little research, watch people and talk a little bit. Find few people which you have at least some idea how to talk with and stick to them, don't try to get on everyone's good side. I don't know if everyone in the class will start as you or is it already class which exsisted before and people already know each other? It may be harder in second case but not impossible. Don't isolate yourself from day 1 and I know it's hard but it's the worst thing you can do because it makes you look like you don't want to talk to anybody and unless some good, social soul is gonna try to talk to you - you are screwed. Stick to small group of people if possible or if someone stands alone asks some basic shit. About life, interests, anything. You may find it pointless and at the start the relationships may not really satisfy you but please give it time.

I'm sorry it became that long. School is very hard topic for me because of experiences and I wish you won't have to go through what I did or even worse. Good luck and don't get discouraged I know it's hard but gtinding your teeth and going through that at the start is gonna pay off."
socialanxiety,ewnimfw,t3_cp655l,1565579309.0,Yeah definitely. But it was little different in my case. Overprotection and giving too much free space is also bad. Because they create comfort zone and gradually it's getting harder to get out of this zone (but they mostly do this unintentionally).

depression,ewfdqv2,t3_co2cz2,1565358357.0,"Alright to start of - you are a great person. Trying to help someone like that and not get discouraged is really something to admire. I and probably a lot of people here would love to have someone like you in our lives.

Back to the topic, I can only give you advice as a depressed person who is starting to change. And it's gonna be typical - meds and therapy. I don't know what caused your bf to develop depression how serious it was but it's the past. He has people which care about him - you. And the action needs to come from him, not you. You can give him advice but at the end it's his choice to change.  I would really suggest just meds at the start. To see if he can feel a little bit better. I don't know if he is working/at school or how old is he. Find goals because depression makes it really hard to find and follow any.

Sorry if advice is really clunky. I'm at the start of changing myself after not doing anything for a few years and I'm starting to realize how much time I wasted while being passive. Support him, but he needs to take a step forward. Good luck."

So yeah don't worry much about it if you feel like you didn't do good enough but feel like you can maybe ask teacher for another try? And if you are nervous maybe tell her that as well so she can hear you out without everyone else and you will be able to show her what you are capable of?

You just need to hold your head higher, don't close yourself from everyone since the start. Try to be open as much as you can. Try hard to not end up in similar position as before.

I don't remember when I had any party at all I'm just getting money and same wishes every year. No cake, no going out. It hurts and in this aspect you have it better. I deleted my birthday from fb and literally ONE person remembered I exist. So yeah I have it little worse than you for whatever it's worth. About your sister.. yeah that's not pretty cool. Maybe she thought you will buy her present later? I don't know the situation so I can only guess. I'm sorry but the part about your mom really bugs me. Why would your mom or anyone from your family have anything against you moving out? That's part of growing up and if your family give you shit for that it's actually stupid. And don't get me wrong I'm in similar situation.. kinda. My older brother moved out early and doesn't care about our family that much anymore and my younger brother also thinks about college and his gf and wants to move out as soon as possible. My mom is arguing a lot with my father and also thinks he is cheating. She wants me to stay but I don't. I still love her but I want to grow up. Is your mother sick? What about your sister, no one gonna give her shit for leaving mother?

Okay to wrap it up, I wouldn't care about not having a gf. Not yet anyways, you need to start feeling better about yourself. You didn't tell if you have a job? Doesn't matter if the answer is yes or no my advice would be to move out. Start your life as an adult, if you are scared to be left alone then I'm not sure how can you fix that. Maybe meds? They helped me a little bit. I'm sorry I can't give you good advice since I'm depressed shit as well, all I can tell you is good luck and don't give up yet we gonna survive somehow."

People saw me being really shy and I was feeling awful and lonely every day. It did get a little bit better with time. I didn't hang out with anyone outside the school but in school I could have some conversations and joke around. I talked only with a few people and not try to fit everywhere. I just needed a little bit more time to fit in at least a little bit and it may be the case for you. It depends on what position you want to be in. I was fine with being on side track joking around from time to time but friendships with my classmates didn't go anywhere further and it was alright for me. I didn't find anyone who would fit to be my friend. 

So yeah I can relate to that. But life doesn't end on school I hope you will find someone you can call friend soon enough."
socialanxiety,etuzt02,t3_cdj181,1563223315.0,Started taking meds recently (well for more than a month). My mood is better and I can enjoy days at least a little bit more. But I have trouble sleeping and at the start I had headache and convulsions but it's gone now. I would say it's definitely worth to give it a shot but you also need to try different meds because they work differently for everyone. No point waiting and if meds don't work well enough don't get discouraged and find something which will work for you the best.
socialanxiety,etlhd7k,t3_cc3b6h,1562936444.0,"You're not alone in that I assure you. Everyone with social anxiety have problem with overthinking to some extent and if you think about it overthinking is the reason for our social anxiety. But I can't give you advice since I have problem with this as well, meds helped me a little bit but I don't have much social intetactions right now. But I still get worried and overthink stuff, mostly at night when I'm trying to sleep. When it's quiet and I don't have anything to occupy my mind (like music or games) I start thinking about stuff and I realize how pathetic me and my life is and can't sleep. I have to take naps during a day and get sleep very late to avoid that. Honestly, I feel you and I can only wish it's gonna get better. Good luck OP."
socialanxiety,etid9dy,t3_cbqzqv,1562846646.0,No clue. And it gets quiet and so awkward. I'm usually blaming myself for being boring.
socialanxiety,etfcpeq,t3_cbg8t1,1562766551.0,"Yep, never posted picture online. Even when I force myself to take a picture I think I look disgusting and delete it. I have the same feeling when someone else takes a picture of me but it would be rude to ask them to delete it."
socialanxiety,eterwxn,t3_cb5s80,1562744108.0,"I can relate to this a lot. I have older brother who is smarter, more outgoing than me and pretty much better at everything. He is also too confident at times. He made my childhood pretty rough and now acts like he doesn't care or he simply doesn't remember. Everyone says that I should look up to him and be like him. It's really annoying. At this point I just wait for him to move out. Good luck OP, remember that your life is yours. Don't compare it to the others."
Phimosis,et5sn5l,t1_et5se5q,1562487704.0,"Said it already but alright. It will get flaccid and foreskin will stay behind the glans, nothing else. And you will be unable to roll it back. And there is no reason to panick because as I said it will take some time to do serious damage you just need to act as soon as you recognize it. You have time to try to fix it yourself or get your ass to the hospital asap if you wont be able to fix it yourself. It was like that in my case anyways."
Phimosis,et5r1wt,t3_ca3f9s,1562485396.0,It gets flaccid if you wont keep erection but skin doesnt come back to the head it just rolls automatically back behind the glans. And paraphimosis just sounds crazy like its gonna choke your dick but for it to start hurting and do some serious damage - it takes some time. I don't know if it's different in some cases but I tell you as someone who had paraphimosis. I forced skin back while erect.
socialanxiety,esst0jb,t3_c92rvb,1562257257.0,A few years ago. I knew some people but most of them were strangers to me. Got overehelmed and faked phone call. Said that I have something important to attend to. Never went to any party after that.
socialanxiety,esksewy,t3_c87gcw,1562072592.0,I don't know what keeps me going but I can't go on and on about what brings me down.
socialanxiety,esh1k9g,t3_c7pdj9,1561978334.0,I feel like I've lost an ability to smile a long time ago. I don't like my smile. So I can't smile or laugh i just smirk a little bit.
socialanxiety,es8riik,t3_c6gjd3,1561710790.0,Yeah and I feel guilty. We used to be best friends and joke around. Lost a contact after going to different schools. I can't talk as easy as I used with him. He sends me messages from time to time asking how am I or to hang out. He is trying to help me find a job or give me advice about my future. Yet I never told him I have SA. I appreciate what he is trying to do but I don't feel comfortable sharing it with him. I feel like we lost connection or chemistry. I really feel like shit because of that since he is the last friend which is talking to me at all.
socialanxiety,es8r49d,t3_c6h4zh,1561710184.0,Recently started taking them as recommended by my therapist (same as in your case). It's been a month since I started and my mood is somewhat better than it was before I guess. But I'm still waiting for some better results.
