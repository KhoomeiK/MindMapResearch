Rasmussen's killer did it out of jealousy and then went on to work for the LAPD and get married/have a kid. 20+ years later some POs were told to go through some unsolved cases and essentially found undeniable evidence that one of their colleagues was the murderer. There's 20 or so minutes of the episode of an interview of this woman's colleagues interviewing her, ""just asking a few questions"". They mention her ex (that went on to marry the woman she murdered) and you can hear the fear in her voice. They then ask what her relationship with his wife was like and she claims to not really have known her, doesn't think she met her, etc. Her tone goes from surprise to defensive af, claiming 0 knowledge, to likely knowing she's fucked. 

I think of this one \*all\* the time. Imagine murdering someone out of jealousy decades ago and having gotten away with it. You create a great life for yourself, everything's going well, the past is the past then BAM. Jail for life. It's \*wild\* to hear it happening in real time. 

&#x200B;

With Jennifer Pan, she was a young girl with 'tiger parents' who expected a lot from her. A ton of kids growing up with Asian parents deal with this, it's not uncommon. She pulls a variety of wild stunts like faking high school graduation and a job as a pharmacist then a break-in happens, killing her mother and putting her father in a coma. The ""robbers"" tied her up upstairs with shoelaces, but not before her father heard her talking to them. When her father was able to break free of his constraints, he bolted to the front yard, rather then upstairs to check on his daughter. Interviews with Jennifer are played in this episode too and they're insane to listen to.

I try to nicely but firmly tell the owner that it's both unsafe and illegal and mostly I get told off because their dog is 'friendly' and 'fine off leash' and it's my dog's problem if they're scared/aggressive.

&#x200B;

Blanche doesn't actually successfully get Dorothy out when she's sick I don't think? Dorothy falls asleep and Blanche asks Sophia to help get her dressed as her date's not picky which was clearly just a line for the laughs, not a legitimate plan. 

&#x200B;

To me the Rusty Anchor episode is a really good one for Blanche's character development. She admits she's jealous of Dorothy (because she's great, she ""lights up the room"") which is clearly extremely difficult for her, as she's so used to being the center of attention. Also the scene where she tries to do a singing number is hysterical. 

&#x200B;

Her blaming Rose for the missing jewelry was not meant to be deliberately mean - she genuinely thought Rose had borrowed then lost it & Rose offered to make up for it. In the end Blanche has to be Rose's servant for an undetermined amount of time as penance for this error."
theGoldenGirls,et0xs6h,t1_eo0g9ip,1562388714.0,"Couldn't have said it better myself. Her vain selfishness is extremely superficial and the part of her character that brings the most humor to the stories. I have this show on in the background about 9 hours a day and give it way more thought than is probably healthy and I truly think Blanche has shown to be a true, genuine friend, even when the others are acting crap. Like when the politician lies about having an affair with her - the girls are so blatantly cruel & refuse to believe her, though she forgives them so easily in the end because they're her best friends and she could understand why they may have believed it was true. She also forgives Dorothy so easily after Dorothy refuses to believe her date had made a pass at Blanche. Then when they're all fighting on the island after being shipwrecked she's the one who prompts them to stop fighting."
theGoldenGirls,et0wudx,t3_bokuft,1562388272.0,"I don't think this episode highlights bad behavior by Blanche at all. She doesn't condone Dorothys' continuing to date a married man, enthusiastically cheering on her role in adultery.  But she also doesn't pass judgement - she says sometimes life doesn't go the way we want and we have to find happiness where we can. She wants Dorothy to be happy and understands love is a complex piece of crap sometimes. 

 I'm one of the people who think Blanche is the best friend (also my favorite) & I think this episode reinforces that. Rose is straight up judgmental while Sophia and Blanche want what's best for Dorothy, though they have differing opinions."
