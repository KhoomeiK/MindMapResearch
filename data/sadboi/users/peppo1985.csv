Last when it happened it was some homeless vagrant who took a swipe at me and missed about 7 years ago and I didn't bother. But not reporting such things does more harm and will bother your conscience. As someone who is responsible for other people I would immediately go and at least make a statement with the police. I am not from here originally but have faced a lot of racism over the years.  Just saying what I would do in your shoes if my or my family's safety is at stake. Also with more and more reporting of such incidents society at large will take it more seriously and good people will start to intervene when such shit goes down. I'm just waiting for the tipping point when these racists feel scared to express hate so openly and without impunity. Society in Germany is yet to get there but possibly is on its way.
