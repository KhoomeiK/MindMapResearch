AskHistorians,fnd7uq2,t3_g10pto,1586862082.0,"Well, having a solid knowledge of how an event affects another and in which way helps to give a dimension to the time and so knowing roughly how events are placed in a timeline. This works, of course, really well for brief periods of time, for example if you have to memorise events of the French Revolution. However, the same could be done for long period. I think it could be useful to imagine a timeline, put a few date as mark points and fill the blank spaces with civilisations, events and so on and associate them with dates. In conclusion, in my opinion, a solid knowledge of facts is the basis a of a solid knowledge of dates.
If you don’t find this useful you may try the method of loci. You can find lot of accurate explanations of this technique online, but I’ll try to explain how it roughly work. It consists in creating an imaginary palace with rooms. In each room you put a few objects (5 or 6 I think) and you associate a date or a concept to each object. When you have consolidated this technique you’ll just have to imagine to walk into the room and you’ll know the date or the concept by seeing the object. Hope to have been useful."
AskHistorians,fnd6vvz,t3_g11vyz,1586861072.0,"Renaissance wasn’t a total return to classicism, it learned the teachings of antiquity and used them in a modern context. In addition, a complete return to antiquity would have meant a return to ancient Greek or Latin. However, ancient Greek was begun to be rediscovered and relearnt, so it was comprehensible to few intellectuals who ha worked in particular in this way, while Latin was the language of the Church. As you said, in this period began the nationalism in Europe. This phenomenon is visible in the fact that states start adopting vulgar languages as official ones. Latin was used, but less, because states, even though they were basically all catholics, wanted to emancipate politically from the Church.
Authors wanted to be understood from states, so used vulgar (a noble vulgar of course, like Petrarch‘ or Dante’s), but if they would have wanted to be understood from the church they would have written in Latin. 
Take, for example, Machiavelli. He refers to antiquity in “The Prince”, but he wants to be understood by governors of different Italian states and he doesn’t want this knowledge to be mediated, symbolically, by the church."

AskHistorians,fnac6sx,t3_g0iq3n,1586794919.0,"Since religion was a consistent part of the society, atheism didn’t become a thing until the born of philosophy, because it questioned first the nature and generated more knowledgeable sciences, then the society and his components, included religion. 
The theories of the movement of Demosthenes could be seen as atheist and so Anaxagoras claiming that the sun is “a fiery mass, larger than the Peloponnese”. Philosophy, declined as science, is definitely a manifestation of atheism.
In the V and IV century BCE, philosophers were often accused of atheism as a direct consequence of wicked behaviours. Socrates is the most common example, but another is Diagoras of Melos, which was no philosopher but a lyrical poet. We also have direct sources of atheism in Protagoras, Aristophanes and Euripedes.
The latter was also considered atheist because of his critical behaviour regarding the gods and it was said that he died killed by some female dogs, the typical death of an atheist.
We have accounts of laws against atheists. One is the Decree of Diopheites, promulgated after the Sicilian Expedition. Because of this law, Anaxagoras was exiliated.
In Rome, atheism came with the Epicureanism, spread by Lucretius’ “On the Nature of Things”.
Epicureanism was a soft form of atheism and it wasn’t persecuted, in fact Romans even followed him."
AskHistorians,fna8uld,t3_g0c2xz,1586793185.0,"It was typical of the Greek religion to deify the heroes of myths. As minor deities, heroes had their own sanctuaries, simple temples or sanctuary usually, but sometimes also the places where the deeds happened or tombs became places of worships. Obviously there weren’t a consistent Panhellenic worship of these minor gods, they were just local deities or character that persisted in a common memory.
This common memory was the myth and it was considered real. It was fundamental that Greeks believed to myths because they were the base of their society, they imposed the rules of living. So, because they were considered real, Greeks identified the places of the myths with real places, thing that in certain cases is simply, because places are often specified. 
Hardly Patroclus and Achilles really existed, they were rather the personification of the important values of the society and for this they were worshipped and believed real."

Well, hoplite warfare changed throughout the years.
 In his origins during the archaic period, it was basically a clash between two armies fully geared. There was a little or no space for different types of soldiers, like archers and slinger that had obviously a lighter equipment. No peltasts for the moment.
This was the trend during the two Persian wars, but something changed during the Peloponnesian  War. V. D. Hanson in his analysis of the conflict gives a proper insight of the phenomenon of the reduction of hoplite gear. The crucial episode happened on the island on Sphacteria, in front of Pylos. Four hundreds spartan hoplites guarded this piece of land, blocking the Athenian contingent. Despite the lack of troops, Cleone managed to break the block by sending on the island not an army of fully equipped hoplites, but a plot on of light-geared soldiers, some peltasts we could say. This was the first tactical operation in Greek warfare that involved a type of soldiers different from the hoplites.
This episode inaugurates a new trend: armours become lighter and lighter and this not-fully-equipped soldiers are used for tactical operation. However, in the last V century and in the first half of the IV century, big clash with heavy geared hoplites still exist, just think to the battles of Cunaxa or Leuctra. 
Things definitely changed in the Hellenistic period. Alexander the Great renovates the hoplite warfare and then Iphicrates reduces the hoplite armour. This means one thing: the ritual of hoplite clash become less and less significant, while the warfare become more complex and as it is more tactical it needs more capacity of movement and flexibility.
I hope to have been useful.
