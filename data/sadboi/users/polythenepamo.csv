depression,fpg0web,t1_fpg0p93,1588590704.0,"Yeah I do need to you're right, but being told others don't have it as good as me doesn't really help. I saw a good therapist for a while but he retired, and I've been on a waiting list to see one (at an easting disorder clinic) for over a year. Been trying for a long time. Thank you for your concern and help though."
depression,fpg0ipi,t1_fpfzc2a,1588590331.0,"Please don't say I should consider myself lucky, please. I've been told this so much and it just makes me feel guilty, not better. I thought this was for sharing real (if maybe a little messed up) feelings? And yes it's useful and good having people care and most of the time I'm happy about it. But when I feel really suicidal I resent it."

AskReddit,f6k22vd,t1_f648j0g,1572903708.0,That's so cheap!!!! 1oz here costs like $300....
AskReddit,f62xx33,t1_f5oyo8e,1572668688.0,Dang how much did that cost???
TrueOffMyChest,f3zf8ih,t3_diw6fr,1571268161.0,"Thank you for this. I keep worrying because I know this is my prime and I'm wasting it all with depression and anorexia and I wish I could just feel okay about myself but I can't. And yeah it's true so many other people in my age group feel shit about themselves it's so sad. But it's encouraging to know that these things get better, thank you for sharing"
TrueOffMyChest,f3rxaxe,t1_ex6rr07,1571093453.0,This kinda attitude just makes it less likely for people to seek help and therefore more likely to end up offending
