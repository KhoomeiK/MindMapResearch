family,fovg1z2,t3_g7wph0,1588100706.0,"Hey I checked out your profile and saw this message hope you don’t mind.  I’m just bored and curious and scrolling the internet.  My advice for you is to focus on yourself.  Google the term enmeshment my parents did they same to me threw me into roles I wasn’t supposed to have in their lives. What goes on between your parents is their problem.  Don’t let their trauma become your trauma.  Be kind, gentle and loving with yourself watch over your grades, and all other aspects of your development.  Create energy in your life that you want to be apart of.  Don’t engage in negative talk with either of your parents.  Google Marisa Peer she’s a hypnotherapist and talks soo much about the power of language, all the crap you hear from your parents needs to be thrown out of your head.  You live them both you don’t have to accept them to love them.  But also you love yourself.  Best thing we can do is learn from our parents mistakes.  Be present with them but don’t be like them.  Hope that helps 💓"
depression,fovdmxz,t1_fovdci2,1588099562.0,"Maybe I phrased it wrong but I think it’s because you get disconnected from reality when there’s so many easy ways to escape nowadays.  Online social media, dating, chatting, podcasts.  Ever just take a moment to be in a room with yourself.  And be really honest with how you feel, how your body feels, how your heart feels."
depression,fov1w79,t1_fov1h3o,1588094043.0,Try dancing.  When I went through really stressful stuff connecting to my feelings and releasing stress through dance really helped.  Especially while listening to the gypsy kings 💃🏻. I’ve had times like that too your gonna be ok.
depression,fov1dp4,t3_g9ndgw,1588093805.0,Probably once you got addicted to being online
depression,foka50a,t1_fok7483,1587838246.0,"Yea.  I suppose that’s what we are all trying to figure out.  What drives you.  I examine who has inspired you and ask yourself why ? What quality did that person have that resonates with you or which quality are you trying to cultivate.  Think of yourself like a plant.  What food will you feed your plant ? Like an example would be: If I want to be a good dancer, because something in dancing inspires me , do I sit all day motionless or do I take different opportunities to move, moving freely or moving in motion to music, or stretching to give me much more range of motion and expression.  Or say right now you are trying to change your place in life from a place of darkness and shade to lightness and positivity, then you must reach out your self towards all things nurturing like fresh air, fresh colorful food , and to attract positive people you must try and spread positivity into the energy field you exist in. Start from a small perspective and reach out from there.  I like thinking in reality my universe goes only into the bubble I’m in and I can only create within this tiny space in the universe.  It’s the canvas I paint upon and it’s always a fresh canvas every sec it’s fresh for me to create anew.  This environment you encapsulate is whatever you think of it.  All the information you need for your own balance is in your space always there speaking to you.  

Another thing is to accept suffering is part of life.  Always embrace the absolute truth in any given situation but see any pain as a great teacher.  Like having kids taught me so much about patience and how much I actually control.    

You don’t need to know exactly what you want but you will be happy if who your are today is better than who you were before and only you know how to do that.  I think people don’t think for them selves often and this makes them in turn feel lost and unhappy with no solution.  Practice being totally present all the time.  One minute doing this, one minute doing that.  Then you will be in your own shoes fully and you will start to know who you are. 

As long as you improve you will build confidence and a better story.  It can be a tiny step.  Like for me right now it’s reading 10 pages a day if I do that I reward myself.  

Goodluck"
depression,fojy6y2,t1_fojxiie,1587831773.0,"I fly above myself in the room I’m in (not literally) I view my life like I’m not me.  Now I imagine I’m the caretaker of me like a parent (which is good if no one really parents you ).  Then I do what the parent would suggest as my best move.  I do that next.  Sometimes it’s a suggestion like “get up and wash you face and teeth” other times it’s “prepare a healthy meal” other times it says “stand tall and don’t slack off”.... I take that voices advice because it’s not really mine it’s my higher self.  

Found this advice years ago.  Forget where but I love it.  

Also don’t own your failures so much.  Just rewrite them in your mind.  Never say “my” failure say that time I failed and explain the story of why and each situation is very unique.  Study yourself so to speak,  this is how you will find yourself your values, your weaknesses.  Be forgiving to yourselve, like a child be gentle with yourself. 💓💓"
depression,fojevv4,t3_g7ptls,1587818893.0,"I used to be like that.  Then some real shit started to unfold and my whole outcome and how I felt about it fell completely on my shoulders there was no story no back ground no identity just pure pain.  Until I learned little ways to transform the pain into useful energy.    Until I learned we write our own stories.  We use the ingredients we have at hand to make the meal we would like to digest.  The ingredients being what we choose to think, eat, do next, focus on etc.... 

When overwhelmed I tell myself :  completely immerse yourself in “x” activity for one whole minute without thinking of anything else. Then I just try and do that over and over until I become more present and less part of a revolving door mentality.  Because when your revolving door keeps smashing into pieces it can get to be a drain on your day to day will to do things.  

This story of I am depressed, should change to I have depression something which I am trying to alleviate. It’s will make you feel more in control and therefore more stable, less likely to dip into a low."

depression,fo29lxf,t1_fo0ybj9,1587454240.0,I love this it’s how I feel about life we affect people whether we think we do or not
depression,fo0slyq,t1_fnzlm3j,1587418997.0,"Your so amazing and mature! I’m a mother and I’ve been suicidal but once I accepted that much of life Is suffering and growth I was ok taking the highs and lows accepting them really helps. Honestly though your absolutely amazing.  And I hope love fills the rest of your life and that you have a really beautiful life!  

And now here you are trying to help people.  I don’t want to sound creepy but your mother would be so proud of you 💓💓💓. I’m literally in tears from your heartfelt message."
depression,fo0revh,t3_g4mufd,1587418368.0,"There’s always something you can add to the world even when your a total piece of shit to yourself and you’ve totally fucked up you can still add to this world by any effort made.  That’s one beautiful thing about life you can decide for yourself what you choose on any given situation.  That’s freedom.  But it’s being aware of this choice that we lack.  We lack the ability to be present because we always try and run away from being present and the more we create a void between ourselves and the present thought distracting ourselves through short term pleasures, the more we suffer.  If you like the thought of escaping yourself draft you in your head which version of yourself your running from now draft up another version of yourself that takes an action that will transform the version of yourself you hate into one you will adore and worship.  Will YOU be the one who gives light to the world or take away their light and leave behind a shadow of darkness. You create yourself.  This is real power.  You are in charge of your destiny.  The pain you feel is a teacher what is it trying to teach you about life or a course of action your partaking in??? Take a small step to be in another direction. Does it make you feel any different.  The fact you wrote this on Reddit proves you have some hope for yourself that’s all the power you need to completely transform yourself.  
We need more people to use pain for gain.  It’s your teacher.  Who ever you are what will you add with your energy to the energy of the world to the readers of Reddit what will you influence others towards by your own will ? If you have life you can give life to others."
depression,fnzz16y,t3_g4p45y,1587403215.0,When you work on yourself and face all your demons and your aligned with your spiritual mission.  When your energy matches with your true souls path and another person is also trying to reach their full potential you will energetically connect with someone. Might be a challenge depending on how far along the path  you are or might be quite nice

AskReddit,fnd4naq,t3_g12tp3,1586858591.0,Hi I’m a mother of 3 avid just blooming gamers who will likely be pro gamers because they already go through games like call of duty in 3 days at age 10.  I haven’t a clue which laptop would be best for them with online gaming like roblox but also more importantly for their future school work and mine also.  I’d like a laptop with windows (I’ll be in nursing school) and Microsoft office but also with good battery life and gaming capabilities.  Please help !!!! 🙏
