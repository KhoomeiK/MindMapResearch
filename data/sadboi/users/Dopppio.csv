chess,fpawycb,t3_gceyym,1588457432.0,the piece im holding is the king and the knights are dragons the rooks are japanese style castles (forgot the proper name of those) i can take more pictures if anyones interested. I just got it its magnificent and im told a japanese lady had them in her house not using them and that its straight from japan. Im just curious if anyone can tell how old it is or its origins because there's fine detail and the pieces are pretty heavy.

trees,fmiqa9z,t1_fmi52y6,1586114732.0,"I would think one experiences physical and psychological withdrawal at first, then after the physical withdrawal its purely psychological aside from brain chemistry from years of smoking. Im not a scientist but the point im trying to make as someone with bipolar and years of smoking is even if you are addicted as hell and dont realize it, the bipolar aspect could still be very important in why weed does what it does. I think i just wrote a whole paragraph with no point. Does this have a point? Why is my weed man ghosting at 3pm when we talked yesterday? I guess my true thing here is i dont understand the psychological aspect versus physical."

Also smoking a blunt on lsd SOMETIMES gets me seriously fucked up like my lungs are shitty ass paper bags or I feel the material of the carpet I’m standing on all over my body or did I forget to stop holding my piss or breathing randomly becoming manual or just some unreal type of thinking that I can no longer remember
