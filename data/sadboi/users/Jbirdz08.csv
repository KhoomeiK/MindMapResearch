I can‚Äôt sleep sometimes and overthink a lot because I feel like I‚Äôm not good enough. I won‚Äôt act like my level of depression can relate to yours. We are all different. Life isn‚Äôt easy and can suck at times, Just keep going. If you can‚Äôt keep going for yourself, do it for your parents or friends or family anything and anyone. Find a reason to keep going. The world needs you and it wouldn‚Äôt be the same without."

AskReddit,fb0hm45,t3_eauhhu,1576426124.0,"The outside: 22, good job in IT...sports car always a smile and a little shy kinda guy. 

The battle in my head: I battle sleepless nights. Overthinking & Depression & not feeling like I‚Äôm good enough. I wake up everyday wishing I could reconnect with old friends (I have none where I live) before I moved and get my life back before my parents divorce emotionally destroyed me. I stay looking for way out. But often want to give up. I have no friends outside of work. I hate where I live (on the coast) and dream of moving back home up north.

It‚Äôs not as much as some people go through but it feels good to get that off my chest."

lonely,f0ovq5r,t3_d5xfgf,1568821350.0,"I feel the same way man, she woke up one day and just decided she didn‚Äôt like me, after our relationship was going so dang well. It drives me nuts I think about her every second of every day. She was so perfect for me and now she‚Äôs gone. But you‚Äôve gotta get up bro. Hit the gym, eat healthy. Force yourself to talk to people. Go to local events. Don‚Äôt lean on substances that could take the pain away cry if you gotta be depressed if you need to but do whatever it takes to move in man. I know exactly how you feel bro and it sucks."
probation,ey3ckxj,t1_ey39ahl,1566761003.0,The only way I can contact her is by phone so my plan is to take care of the issue then probably calm her and let her know because my next meeting with her is a month out
probation,ey395ps,t1_ey38ygg,1566758523.0,Thanks this is why I love reddit. Because of you guys. It gives me a chance to talk openly about shit that worries me for no reason. I‚Äôm going to call her just to touch base once more tomorrow. Thank you for your input <3

probation,ey16gm0,t1_ey168ai,1566691103.0,Considering I have had a run in with the law with this ticket and I called her immediately do you think this will effect me getting out of my probation and situation at the end of the 6 month s?
probation,ey15ysn,t1_ey15w9v,1566690724.0,Is it up to her to decide if I violated it though even though in the end even tho I technically did on paper?
ForeverAlone,exdn8ps,t3_cs2r7k,1566181225.0,I just want you to know I needed to see this. I‚Äôve literally been battling with myself after my last relationship.

Or she might have only been with me at the time because I drove a nice car and she was into that stuff. Probably came out as a misunderstanding from me to you. But thank you for your input."
relationship_advice,ewatet0,t1_ewasxho,1565251444.0,Well after I thought we were really into each other I asked her to be my girlfriend. She said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like that‚Äù in person then it went from that to a text after I dropped her off saying maybe we should get to know each other more because her last bf was a loser from what I understood. I said sure and we still went on dates always held hands and such. I was never a clingy acting weird guy or rude. So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm just like wtf. I‚Äôm 22 I drive a super nice car and have a hella good job. I have my head screwed on right I guess is what I‚Äôm getting at and I know what I want in life. But we never declared each other a thing like bf/gf we went around acting like we were though. But I guess the answer would be no üòê
relationship_advice,ewaspzk,t1_ewasedj,1565250979.0,"It‚Äôs been about a week now, I had girls hit me up while we talked but I respected what we had at the time. But yeah maybe I should just drop it and let it go. As bad as I wanted it to work out. It‚Äôll sound cheesy but it might have just not been meant to be. She probably does think I‚Äôm twiddling my thumbs waiting though come to think about it."
relationship_advice,ewasdvy,t1_ewas4m7,1565250756.0,"Yeah I get that, that could very well be the case. I definitely hope it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôll take it like a man if it is ‚òπÔ∏è I just hate how she could leave me wondering. It‚Äôs such a shitty thing to do. Should I give it more time and try to talk to her again? Or invite her out? Or just leave it."

relationship_advice,ewarm3s,t1_ewaq7zc,1565250242.0,I figured and feared that. It is what it is if that‚Äôs the case. My thing is how can you just go from having such a good relationship with someone to it just being nothing üòû
