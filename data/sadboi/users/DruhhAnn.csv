relationship_advice,foxrsyn,t3_g9zqgb,1588154042.0,"There are a ton of good answers here, but I just wanted to add: I‚Äôve been in a situation where something personal and embarrassing became public knowledge and I was joked about extensively over it. I‚Äôm from a tiny rural town, and I get what you mean regarding not knowing how certain people even got the memo in the first place. It felt like EVERYONE knew. 

First off: I feel you should definitely own it and take the power away from people who try to put you down over it. Your friends are not genuine if they‚Äôre doing that to you. 

& Second: My experience made me realize people just want some cheap drama/entertainment. I didn‚Äôt think the jokes and humiliation would end but it did. Once time had passed and people became distracted by new drama, it seemed most of them forgot completely. My life started to feel normal again.

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having to deal with this crappy situation. Just ride the wave and wait for it to pass, because it absolutely will. Also, congrats on scoring your dream job!"
socialskills,fosot7n,t3_g9370v,1588034974.0,"God, yes! I tell myself I that I should be that for other people. That‚Äôs my yearly, ongoing resolution: Be a warm, accommodating and friendly person. Those people are the ones I always appreciate when I‚Äôm anxious in social situations."
socialskills,fnrlahx,t3_g3geum,1587192598.0,"I notice this ALL THE TIME in public settings or at work. I think it has a lot to do with my anxiety. When I‚Äôm in public functions or at work, interjecting in group conversations is hard for me. 

That said, I‚Äôve noticed when I‚Äôm with good friends (friends I‚Äôve known for years), we interrupt each other in group convos left and right. Not in a rude way, but in a high-energy/interested way. I think everyone does it, and it‚Äôs not as noticeable or off-putting as we assume it is."
socialskills,fnahtql,t3_g0hv8r,1586797760.0,"Answers that revolve around getting involved in activities are good ones! A lot of the answers here have good advice. I‚Äôll also say that high school friends and high school drama ended up not being worth the time I thought about them, personally.

Most of my classmates up to my senior year, thought I was mute. My social anxiety was through the roof and I spent a handful early HS lunches sitting in a restroom stall.

After going to college, meeting new people and getting involved in groups/clubs, I realized 1. The HS/public school environment wasn‚Äôt for me and 2. I guess I had just changed? Idk. Not sure how it happened, but I felt less anxious overall. 

So my advice would be to get involved in what you can, but at the same time know that HS isn‚Äôt forever and the embarrassing/lonely moments that feel very raw right now will hopefully be fuzzy memories in the future."

SuicideWatch,ffv8t9v,t3_esy5hp,1580258409.0,"I rarely comment on reddit and am mostly a lurker. Also, I cannot comprehend your pain. It‚Äôs unimaginable and something a person should never have to experience. 

I stumbled on this post a good while ago and felt maybe it would fit. I‚Äôll link it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/my_friend_just_died_i_dont_know_what_to_do/c1u0rx2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) .

Take care of yourself and lean on those around you. As stated in other comments, reach out to whoever you can. My heart hurts for you and I‚Äôm so incredibly sorry."
CasualConversation,fenvnzv,t3_eq2y5v,1579291621.0,What a wonderful lady. Treasure her! That gig is not for everyone and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs emotionally exhausting/devastating at times. I‚Äôm thankful people like her whom partake in that line of work exist.
ContraPoints,fe6qbm0,t1_fe5sxfv,1578900425.0,"Agreed. Not only does getting off of those sites limit the footprints left by former posts (even more so if privacy laws are put in place), in my experience, it just feels refreshing.

I scrapped Fb and Twitter with the intent of stopping for a month, but it‚Äôs carried on for roughly half a year. I never realized how much anxiety they caused, even if scrolling through was somewhat entertaining at times. 

Anyway,.. If any turmoil is present due to my former social media engagements, I‚Äôm grateful I‚Äôm not there to see it."
KindVoice,fe3xlec,t3_enn2od,1578853797.0,"You‚Äôll kill this final, but just know that regardless of the outcome, this is a small aspect of your education as a whole. Take a deep breath, take care of yourself, do your best, and know that you‚Äôve done everything you can to prepare! 
Imagine the relief you‚Äôll feel once it‚Äôs all said and done. 
Good luck!"

I used Chegg for my last year of grad school and wish I had done it my entire college career. Beats college bookstore rent/purchase prices by a landslide."
