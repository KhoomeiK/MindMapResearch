I do think it should be comprehensive in the way that traditional schools aim to be. Nuanced, multidisciplinary knowledge leads to really rich ideas and thought. At the same time, the current  rigidity and structure is waaaayyyy too much. It squashes creativity and curiosity.

I think project based learning is a great means to that end. Teachers provide a frame work for what is to be learned but the students explore the topics. They learn skills and information organically. Because they decide the objective, it’s works with what the students naturally lean towards.

I like the Montessori method a lot too. The collaborative nature is really beautiful as well as the emphasis on problem solving and critical thinking.

In regards to students with learning differences, I think this kind of system would be more adaptive and have less inherent barriers. I think it would also be more compassionate. 

Just my thoughts :)"

Why would an employer pay you what you are worth? There would be no profit if everyone was paid the full value of their labor.

My sleep quality can also be predictive. If my body is changing my established schedule, it’s usually indicative of a cycle. I use it as a signal to get more support. Too much sleep? Depression. Too little sleep? Mania. Then I see my pdoc to get a med adjustment and increase talk therapy sessions.
