SuicideWatch,f8i21ao,t1_f8i0xl2,1574583060.0,I know. But she just cut me off. No real explanation or anything. I could get over it if I was given closure but she just said no. Really was in love with that girl.
SuicideWatch,f8i1dcr,t1_f8i0a2g,1574582819.0,"Yeah, but your family support you and listen to you. It must be tough. But you have people around you that want to help I’m sure.  just talking to someone helps. If you want to talk I’m always here. I went through.... well I’m going through a difficult situation. And even though it was really hard to accept, I had to ask for help"
SuicideWatch,f8i0aet,t1_f8hzt7b,1574582420.0,Yeah I know. It just numbs it for a bit. It doesn’t help. I really miss her and it ended badly.
SuicideWatch,f8hzwyl,t1_f8hz4q7,1574582308.0,Yeah it does. There’s a podcast called griefcast that talks about loosing someone. It’s really good. What makes you feel helpless?

SuicideWatch,f743bue,t1_f73cz94,1573397850.0,After we “broke up” we still met and went to restaurants. One time when I was walking her home we saw someone we both knew ahead of us and she just ran away. When I asked her why she ran she said “I didn’t want to be seen with you”. I felt like shit
SuicideWatch,f742svj,t1_f73cz94,1573397669.0,She paints me as a monster to our common friends. She said so many hurtful things about me that aren’t true. I don’t have any real friends now because of it.
SuicideWatch,f73sq03,t1_f73fonb,1573394645.0,She won’t talk to me. She’s said really hurtful things to common friends
SuicideWatch,f73e12q,t1_f73dafx,1573390626.0,No it’s ok. I went to her place last week to try to talk to her. She didn’t answer but sent me a message saying she’s scared

SuicideWatch,f73c03a,t1_f73b5kw,1573390119.0,"No it’s pretty much the same. I sent her messages and she viewed them but didn’t reply. I asked if we could meet, for closure. But she didn’t reply. I hate thinking she thinks I’m a monster, or that I’d hurt her. I would never."
SuicideWatch,f73b0qo,t1_f738wpw,1573389881.0,Hey. Thanks for talking to me yesterday

Honestly, I’ve tired to kill my self but was caught by my family and I fight the urge to do it again coz I know it’d hurt them so much. So it’s like I’m stuck between this pain of an ended relationship and not ending it coz of the loyalty to my family"
SuicideWatch,f6ywdqk,t1_f6yw8x6,1573301169.0,It’s ok. It’s just nice to talk to someone about it. Can I ask a question?

I went back to my country to save a bit of money. Then all of a sudden she called and said she didn’t want to get back and it was over. 
I used to sleep a lot to forget about it but now that doesn’t work either."
SuicideWatch,f6yuqae,t1_f6yujea,1573298645.0,Yeah I don’t want to do that. I’m not young myself. How long did it take you to get over it?
SuicideWatch,f6yug1o,t1_f6ytn5r,1573298171.0,I get what you mean but it’s so painful. I’m surprised I’ve lasted this long. If I could forget about it it’d help but I can only forget about it for the shortest of times. It’s always there
