aww,f2dkzdh,t1_f2dau54,1570157026.0,"aww :,) my cat always meows at everyone when its around 10-11pm if we are not in bed, as if telling us to go to sleep! 

somedays i stay up to do work until late and she sits on the chair on the other end of the living room and just looks into my direction. sometimes she falls asleep in my direction. shes also a total lap cat so whenever im having my meals she will just jump onto my lap and sit down on all fours. its so cute 

she gets anxious whenever its night time and everyone isnt home yet. such a sweet and caring creature, really. there was once someone left home for camp (3d2n) and she was waiting by the door every night! 

ah, i love her so much with all my heart! its really strange though because we are the same age (im 19 too). she’s just like a sister to me and i havent been without her my entire life!"
