When I find someone that I like I fucking go for it. Some would consider that moving too fast but I think life is too short to waste time playing games and following some arbitrary timeline."
AskWomen,f0cyr1a,t3_d4hw7y,1568547099.0,"I watch the Charisma on Command channel on Youtube and one thing really stuck with me - to “fake” confidence you have to believe that everything is going to be okay. 

So if I’m in a situation where I feel inadequate or unsure I remind myself “everything’s going to be okay” and it takes the pressure off.  I think - I may not be able to do this but I’m going to try. If I screw up then whatever - at some point everything is going to be fine again."
BipolarReddit,ez2fdyd,t3_czrivz,1567655135.0,Idk but I always have dry mouth so I think dehydration could be related to that. As for the fatigue...maybe you could try taking it at night? I do that with some of my meds and it seems to help.

BipolarReddit,ez2aibq,t3_czuwj3,1567653948.0,"It could be disassociation, depersonalization, or derealization which are all different flavors of feeling like things aren’t real. I’ve had these feelings in passing and they are always really upsetting."
bipolar,eyxwxfs,t1_eyvosec,1567564669.0,Stop calling me out like this
bipolar,eyvtuac,t1_eyvcj62,1567511495.0,"When I’m angry I try to remove myself from the situation until I’ve calmed down. This includes getting away from people so I don’t inadvertently lash out. If I can’t remove myself, I try to take a few breaths and focus on releasing the tension in my body. 

I’m an analyzer so if I’m angry I try to step back and objectively view the situation and figure out what exactly is causing such an emotional response. Sort of like cognitive behavioral therapy.

When I’m *really* angry, the only thing I can do is just wait 5-10 seconds before verbally responding to someone. Even that wait time helps keep my feelings somewhat under control.

Ugh, micromanagers are the worst. I’ve literally resigned from a job before because of a micromanaging supervisor. One thing that kinda helped was asking for their input on projects I didn’t really care about to refocus their attention away from projects I *did* care about. It didn’t work all of the time but I felt like it gave me some control over the situation. I hope your supervisor gets off your case soon."

bipolar,eyv1bnv,t3_cyw3tg,1567477762.0,"Ok so first thing’s first: drink some water. Then you should probably get some sleep and sober up. Try to go to work - especially since you’ve just started. But if you need to take a sick day, then do it and hopefully your boss will understand. It’s better than going into work with a massive hangover.

In the future, try to avoid alcohol as a coping mechanism. In my experience it makes things ten times worse. But I’ll say to you what one Redditor said to me: at least you are trying to feel better. Even if you didn’t pick the best coping mechanism.

If you’re having suicidal thoughts please go see your doctor and/or reach out to friends/family asap. They can give you the help you need right now. I hope you feel better soon."
bipolar,eyv0fys,t3_cytnjt,1567477062.0,"I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. I’ve been there and it’s overwhelming. Remind yourself - you’re doing the best you can and it’s okay to take things one day, one hour, one minute at a time. As far as coping goes the recommended methods still apply - sleep, taking meds, diet, exercise - but if those seem impossible just do one thing at a time. Be gentle with yourself. 

Personally, I like to use the HALT system. Am I hungry? Angry? Lonely? Tired? Then I address that particular problem. Sometimes I’m all four so I just pick one.

Your feelings are valid and breaking down just shows you how strong you’ve been for months. Give yourself some credit - that’s pretty freaking impressive. 

Things will get better soon, they just suck right now. Sending good vibes your way."

>	I mean, I guess they are clean and dredged. I find them boring, not much plant life, tide pools, features in general.

Lighthouses, wild horses, I mean even the Outer Banks are a feature in itself.

>	uhh you mean like rednecks?

Lmao, you didn’t enjoy hearing 3 different dixie horns in your high school parking lot? But no, I was thinking Asheville, Cherokee, Old Salem...and then on the commercial side of things we have some pretty good sports teams and food/wine/beer.

>	kill me

Yeah, I’m not a beer fan either but NC has a ton of breweries. Some of them are even pretty decent from what I’ve heard.

>	not in my city but I’d love that.

Check out the NC Wine Festival. Twice a year in Clemmons & Raleigh.

>	kill me

Not a BBQ fan, ok. How about Bojangle’s? Krispy Kreme? Or the god-tier holy grail of fast food aka Cookout? (side note: our food options are incredibly unhealthy)

>	Charlotte is the chainiest place I’ve ever been. Corporate America runs that town.

No arguments there.

>	Raleigh/Cary/Chapel Hill/Durham have some cool places for sure. Seems great for college and livable for most people.

Absolutely. Winston-Salem has its own thing too. Asheville as well (though I admit it is becoming more gentrified)

>	NC is good compared to much of America. I compare it to the better places the US and earth has to offer.

I’ve often dreamed of moving, and maybe someday I will, but I hope to see NC grow because it certainly has potential."
