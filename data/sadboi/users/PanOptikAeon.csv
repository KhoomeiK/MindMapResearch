Hope is like expectation, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.  I remember when worrying about being hit by a killer asteroid used to be a thing, then that giant state-sized volcano underneath Yellowstone was gonna blow up, etc.

(Edit: Of course we could still get hit by that killer asteroid, so there's that)

The economic hit is definitely gonna be a big one for sure, but I suspect (but don't hope) that things'll bounce back pretty quick because people are going to be itching to get out and do stuff which equates with spending money.  I'm still ridin' high on my stimulus check, pursuing my lifelong goal of maximum chillax with minimum effort, and it's finally paying off.  The downside is there's going to be some inflation in a year or so but ... we'll deal with that then.

You can connect with people online via chat if that's your thing, there's people out there ready to party or date or whatever.

I never did follow up with the person as to what exactly was meant. Probably some weird fantasy that just popped outta their head in the heat of the moment. Oh well.)"
depression,fr42r93,t3_gm8o1z,1589873836.0,"Different people feel very differently about birthdays, I've come to realize over the years (and as the comments below will prove!)  Some people really want to make a big thing out of them, others hate them, a lot of people are just indifferent, or maybe their feelings are different from year to year depending on how good or bad the previous year was.

18 and 21 are naturally the ""biggies"" in our culture.  30 is another biggie.  I think after that people tend to lose interest.  Personally I'm at the point where I just focus on the decades and half-decades. 

Anyway, point is you're not ""supposed"" to want to do anything in particular in regards to your own birthday.  It's your business if you want to sit in silence all day and do nothing.  In fact, I find that observing a birthday with a certain amount of reverence and even fatalism isn't a bad thing and I think we'd be better off if more people spent more time sitting in silence doing nothing for just a day."
flds,fr3ubyl,t3_gm0pk9,1589866496.0,"The term 'racist' didn't exist in the 1830s.  The church was founded (like many others) by mostly European immigrants.  They considered themselves part of the 'lost tribes' of ancient Israel, and thus literal Israelites.   African, or any other peoples, were not factored into the equation.  (As there are also Afrocentric religions that do not accept European adherents.)

One of the original aims of the church was the 'Gathering,' specifically meaning the gathering of the 'lost tribes' of Israel, on the American continent (U.S., later moved to what would have been the Deseret Republic) in preparation for the Apocalypse.  Remember these 'lost tribes of Israel' specifically meant Europeans.  Gathering also meant that, if you were a convert from Europe (or anyplace in the U.S. for that matter besides the designated gathering place) you were expected to physically relocate to the center place of the final gathering, which was originally Independence, Missouri and later SLC.

The early Mormon church wasn't the only church that held to this 'lost tribes' theology; it had been in existence probably since as long as Christianity had been in Europe, but the LDS church emphasized it.

Later, the mainstream church watered it down more and more as the years went by -- deciding, for instance, that members in various countries were to 'gather' in their home countries and no longer were expected to immigrate to the U.S. to join the rest of the church.  Today, more than half of the church's membership does **not** live in the U.S., and Africa is one of the few places where the mainstream church is still growing.  I suspect that these early teachings are not even mentioned in passing and that most new converts aren't even aware of these teachings at all.

Point being (after all this data dump) is that the FLDS prided itself on sticking to the original teachings, which included seeing its members in the lineage of the lost tribes of Israel, and that Africans or non-Europeans in general are not considered of that lineage. Or something. 

I'm not sure what the official designated 'gathering place' is anymore in regards to the FLDS church; whether it's still CC or if they plan on someday returning to Independence or whatever.  I think Warren Jeffs' downfall put a big crimp in the FLDS's long-term plans."

At the risk of offering even more useless advice, I'd suggest that your intense depression is 'normal' for you.  If you don't feel like getting out of bed or leaving the house, don't. Let your mental paralysis become the meditation.  Bodhidharma stared at a wall for nine years (with bathroom breaks presumably) until he 'got it' at last.

One of the teachers I've read says something along the lines that it's about becoming 'okay' with deep depths of 'not-okayness,' deeper than you might be comfortable with, and being 'okay' with it never ending.

humanresources,fpys5p8,t3_gf8y9m,1589008491.0,"Thanks for the AMA.

There's probably hundreds of takeaways from this discussion, but I do feel that one key going forward has to be building a more robust and adaptable resource management paradigm that proactively embraces interdepartmental and small-group needs.

Technology has already become so much a part of our work life that one has to address very specific and actionable elements in order to remain relevant. New opportunities, often in the form of crises, arise unpredictably and organizations need to be mobile and flexible enough to respond and adapt -- notice for instance the exponential rise of Zoom in the past few months, something probably not foreseeable even a year ago.  (Doubling its market value and likely rendering it a tasty prospective target for Google, perhaps.)

HR always needs to remain cognizant of its role to be in service to specific organizational and departmental needs, but to otherwise maintain its appropriate background role, while reinforcing requisite ties with legal and regulatory departments in regards to complex, ever-changing, and often contradictory employment laws across global jurisdictions.

Work-at-home is certainly a huge issue in the current time frame, of course, and HR needs to be cognizant of the dangers of the central organization encroaching upon workers' non-work lives, a far greater danger than the opposite that organizations usually seem concerned about (decrease in the ability to micromanage it what this concern often camouflages.)  Questions may be raised, at some point, about the dividing line between employee and independent contractor, when many more employees can now control their own schedules to a greater degree.

Larger organizations may even be able to strike a balance between work in office and remote work, by providing the equivalent of coworking spaces or minimally-equipped satellite offices, where remote work or ""work at home"" employees could have access to basic requirements (desk, supplies, fax/copier, high-speed connections, etc.) , closer to their homes, in a more widely spaced out interior plan (for social distancing) and with relatively lower overhead than the official corporate office."

Therapy can help in a lot of cases. Introspection and self-inquiry helps a lot (and should work hand-in-hand with therapy.)

So, to put it another way, every self is a ""true self,"" or none is, and your pre-trauma self was just as true while it was presenting itself as your current self. You may find some old reactions reappearing from time to time, for instance, in response to random stimuli that your memory connects with the trauma, and so forth. So as you work on yourself and introspect and inquire, you can see that reaction coming, sometimes.

The various states are independent entities in many respects, with many quasi-sovereign powers and rights of enforcement, as the various contrasting responses to the recent COVID hysteria demonstrate (to take only the most recent example.)  The only thing they are prohibited from is anything specifically delegated to the Feds or prohibited directly (most obviously, the printing of money or maintaining a military.)

If secession wasn't implicitly permitted at the time of the Constitution, the Southern states never would have joined the Union, and this was known and the  major reason it was written the way it was.  And of course it would have been known that if things ever came to secession in the South, it would likely be over the issue of slavery.

This is not to defend slavery and/or the South's arguments in favor of slavery as the main reason behind their secession efforts.  IMO, it was the totally wrong argument to make, even if it was legitimate at the time. As far as the Constitution was concerned, no reason for secession need be given and no justification made, other than the individual votes of the votes of the states in question. 

Eventually, I strongly suspect that slavery would have come to an end in the South anyway, independence or no.  Slavery went on in the western hemisphere, especially around the Caribbean (of which the deep South was largely an extension) for many years after the Civil War.   It didn't end in Brazil until 1888, for instance, without need of a civil war to end it.

"" Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery. By the time it was abolished after years of campaigning by Emperor Pedro II n 1888, an estimated four million slaves had been imported from Africa to Brazil, 40% of the total number of slaves brought to the Americas. ""  


By the time of the Civil War, however, the Union had realized that it would not be strategically in their favor to have a potential enemy on their southern border, so close to Washington, and threatening to expand westward in direct competition with the Union's own westward expansion.  They also couldn't risk an independent South allying with European powers, thus extending European entanglements on the continent.

The Union also could not accept the idea of losing the economic potential of the South, mostly untapped at the time (compared to the industrialized North), but serving sort of like the sweatshops of the present-day Third World or perhaps the  maquiladoras of Northern Mexico.  One suspects most in the North would have preferred the South simply end slavery nominally and replace it with some alternative, more acceptable to their moral sensibilities (which it more or less did with sharecropping after the war, with contracts that rendered sharecroppers into quasi-slaves) but it was not to be.

The agrarian plantation system in the South was doomed to failure at some point, as it was in the rest of the Caribbean.  It never would have taken hold in the far West, which never had the labor-intensive plantation system, and where the CSA would likely have eventually butted heads with Mexico and find its western flank in the same position as the U.S. Southwest is today -- probably even more under Mexican domination, given the CSA's much weaker military and looser federal organization which probably would have stymied an organized response against Mexico, if it ever came to that.

Both a rump U.S. and an independent CSA would have had the same conflicts with the native tribes during their westward expansion, in addition to the complexities of competing with each other, Mexico, and Canada."
ArtefactPorn,fpn8uo0,t1_fpkdmby,1588754273.0,"Possibly, but from seeing examples in several other cultures (arguably back to paleolithic times) I'd say it's meant to represent the ""aura"" or subtle energy emission that can sometimes be detected or perceived around highly awakened people.

In yoga it's known as the crown or sahasrara chakra (thousand-petalled lotus energy) , a point focused around the top of the head (the fontenelle, the final part of the skull to harden in a human infant sometime after birth) and usually extended a few inches above the top of the head.   It is also the spot through which the consciousness of the advanced adept is supposed to pass through upon leaving the physical form.

sociopath,fpjelij,t3_gdi2ke,1588665665.0,"I guess just like most average working class American white folks.  I don't think about it much and am somewhat surprised by the question. Maybe I don't remember enough.

I think my (our collective?) early childhood experiences are more attributable to environmental and socio-cultural circumstances than any other factor. The economic class I was born into, the ethnic background of my parents, how we lived, etc.

So, if this makes sense, I deduce in present time a lot of things about my early childhood rather than ""remember"" them.  I know I was an only child of a middle-aged couple (she 30ish, he 45ish), which would have made me unusual among my peers in primary school -- having parents considerably older than those of my peers and being an only child.

Thus creating a sense of separation from the get-go, and being a kid, having no clue about the reason why.  Hell, I'm middle-aged and only just really gaining a deep comprehension of these things.

(Back to childhood me) -- Blamed and resented my parents for the isolation I felt at school, becoming a spoiled brat. Later blaming them for ""making me"" a spoiled brat by overindulging me.  Later than that realizing that that is what a lot of older parents, esp. first-time parents, will do with an only child.

Being introverted and liking books, Legos, cats, science fiction.  Being made fun of all through school (less so later in high school) for all of that stuff. Eating lunch alone in a stairwell because I just could not stand to be in the lunchroom with all those other kids and noise.   I was only bullied a few times, and not that severely, so that wasn't a major issue.  (More like taking your lunch money type stuff)

Had maybe one or two friends at the most in primary school and none in high school. I had a boyfriend, I guess, around age 10, and it broke my heart when he moved away one day.  Which in retrospect I find interesting that I had a boyfriend many years before I had an actual girlfriend (in my 20s.)

Mother over-indulgent, impulsive and combative at times, my father alternately distant/self-isolating and expressing outbursts of futile frustrated anger.  At one point my dad and mom slept in separate rooms in the house. My dad growing more self-isolating, rarely saying more than a sentence at a time if he could help it. At one time seeing visions of the Virgin Mary and various angels and telling us about it. Later my mom and I laughed behind his back, foolishly I think in retrospect.  (Neither my mom nor a child-I had the self-awareness to appreciate the whole broader perspective, the ""horror of the situation"" as Gurdjieff called it.)

The one single line of advice I remember from my father is ""don't let 'em finagle ya!"" (i.e. don't get bamboozled, implying that he got fooled a lot in his life, maybe.)  His other line that I remember is ""you can't win for losin'"" which makes no sense to me grammatically, then or now.

My father was honest to a fault, overly obsequious to authority figures, yet had no qualms spending most of my mother's money during their marriage. He worked sporadically, menial labor, to supplement his veteran's pension.  In his 60s he was working as a dishwasher in the cafeteria at a local university where I had once applied to study -- to give you an idea of what we're talking about here.

(I mean, if it were me I'd make damn sure my only son (me) never found out what that I was doing for a living, I'd keep it mysterious or make up some b.s. story or title like ""consultant in commercial food services, affiliated with the local university"" etc.)

At one time, years later when he was quite old and I was an adult, he revealed that his own relationship with his father had been tempestuous; his father (who died in the 1930s and I never met) was often absent, drunk, and abusive. My dad said that he had once seen a little light way up in the sky, like a UFO or something, and he thought that maybe it was his father coming back.

Then came my teen years, parent's acrimonious divorce, loss of childhood home and having to move to a series of successively less pleasant apartments in successively poorer neighborhoods with my mother and not really comprehending it all. Becoming even more introverted as I gained more independence, more bookish, my mother (smartly enough) leaving me to my own devices and not laying down too many rules for me while I lived there, especially after I started to drive.

These days my dad is moldering in a plot in a cemetery on the other side of the country, my mom (at least 5 pounds worth of her bone ash anyway) is sittin' in a box on the shelf.  The cheap plastic one that they give you with the bag o' ashes, because I couldn't make up my mind what kind of urn to buy and realizing what a stupid waste of money it would be anyway so I never got around to getting one."

""One morning, after about a week at the halfway house, Katie had a life-changing experience. As she lay on the floor (she didn’t feel worthy enough to sleep in a bed), a cockroach crawled across her ankle and down her foot. She opened her eyes, and all her depression and fear, all the thoughts that had been tormenting her, were gone. 'While I was lying on the floor,' she says, 'I understood that when I was asleep, prior to cockroach or foot, prior to any thoughts, prior to any world, there was—there is—nothing. In that instant, the four questions of The Work were born.' She felt intoxicated with joy. The joy persisted for hours, then days, then months and years. ""

Lake Ohrid is good one, I had forgotten I was there too ... nice little place.

It's true there are no ashram type places (that I know of) around there but the Bektashi Sufi tekke in Tetovo is a wonderful place and well worth the visit if you're in the neighborhood.  The head sheikh/dervish was a cool old guy who didn't speak any English, but he spoke Turkish and German and I was able to communicate with him adequately in German. They let me stay there a few days and fed me wonderfully.

Their main gripe, from what I could understand, was not so much with local Orthodox (who are in the minority in that part of Macedonia) but with more fundamentalist Muslims who consider the Bektashis heretics.  I don't know how things have worked out since I was there in '08.

I later visited the main Bektashi center or h.q. in Tirana, Albania and got to meet their Dedebaba (basically like a pope or something) but since we couldn't speak any languages in common, it was a brief but cordial meeting.

I'd rather be stuck in Budapest than Belgrade for instance if it's going to be an extended period of time (finances may be an issue though.)

Sofia is a fun little city definitely worth considering. Certainly recommended over Belgrade.  I haven't been to Bucharest but have heard good things about it (thank you Rick Steves.)

Skopje was nothing to write home about, though during one trip I found a cool little Bektashi Sufi tekke (like an ashram, basically) in Tetovo where they let me stay a while at minimal cost, though at the time there was some tension between the more liberal Sufis who've been running the center for centuries and some more hardline puritanical types who were trying to take it over.  YMMV.  Remember that Macedonia (by whatever name) is sharply divided with mostly Orthodox in the eastern half and Islamic in the western half.

(I didn't have this anger when my 85 year old mom died, for instance, because it felt in the natural order of things.)

It is possible to look at your life backwards, seeing earlier manifestations of the death wish as advance-echoes of your ultimate foreordained fate. It may be noteworthy that those earlier death-attempts were not accompanied by the current terror you mention now. Perhaps if they had been accompanied by that emotional content, it may have changed your view of your life up until now -- you might have lost that death wish after the first failed attempt.  Who knows.

I guess my number one wish would be that you would be miraculously and inexplicably healed. Short of that unlikely phenomenon, I'd recommend (with no authority whatsoever) trying to discover your ultimately birthless, deathless nature and the nonexistence of the ""I.""

I don't have a problem with diagnostic categories per se, though I acknowledge the subjective nature of many of them (being familiar with the evolution of the DSM and the controversy over the DSM-5.)  They are, like most labels, only instruments or means to an end.  They can be helpful to point you in a certain direction. 

I myself, for instance, currently wear the badgees of MDD (major depressive disorder) and ptsd, the latter of which I found it necessary to acquire in order to qualify for my state's marijuana card. So in sessions, I made a point of emphasizing the nightmares, hypervigilance, and all that.  It certainly would be counterproductive (I think) to get the sociopath badge, let alone deliberately try to obtain it.  I don't really want to know how David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear, you know.

But the Randian view is very basic and not particularly sophisticated or profound. It's also stuck on the dharmically erroneous idea of a permanent abiding ""ego.""
