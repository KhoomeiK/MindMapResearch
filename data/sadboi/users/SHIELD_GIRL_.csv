Also, does the prescribing doctor know that you stop taking them? Sorry for the questions just trying to understand and help you out. You really do need to tell your parents or guardians and the person you slept with about all of this. If you don't now, then it can hurt you and your family, I don't want to see that happen. Try not to stress any more about this because that could also be a factor into why you missed your period. It doesn't always mean that you're pregnant. Especially with the stress, you taking those two birth control pills, having sex does throw off hormone levels as well, and well worse comes to worse you are actually pregnant. Talk to your family, the guy you slept with, and take a test. If you're not pregnant, please talk to a doctor, get on bc and they might want to test you for STDs to make sure you don't have any. I'm also not sure if anybody has told you this but STDs can also throw off your. It's one of the first signs that you have it. Please please talk to your family and get checked. I just don't want to see anything bad happen to you.

I know this is a lot but you did get yourself into this mess. Take care of yourself please."
Periods,fp6gqaj,t3_gbibk9,1588352053.0,"Okay, well with you saying you took 1 or 2 birth controls, that can throw things off especially depending on where you took them from in the pack. also to know the pull out method doesn't always work. Make sure there's always a condom and make sure you're consistently taking birth control if you want to continue having sex. Also beware that lots of stress can throw off your period (I was so stressed once that I missed mine for a month). Take a pregnancy test just to be safe. Take care of yourself (mentally and physically).

Edit - [Here is a website about birth control as plan b.](https://www.onemedical.com/blog/live-well/quirky-questions-do-birth-control-pills-work-like-plan-b) As long as you took the right amount of pills to add up to 1mg of hormones you might be good. Have you even told your parents or guardians about this and do they know that you stopped taking bc and that your sexually active? I'm worried about you because have a kid this young does some pretty hurtful things to your body. Please be more careful next time."

Wicca,fp4u5kj,t1_fp4u0ff,1588307464.0,Okay thank you so much for that. I honestly thought that me thinking like that was wrong. I'll definitely warn him about it. Thank you again. Stay safe.
Wicca,fp4tkvp,t1_fp4t2i2,1588307042.0,"It's mainly for aesthetic purposes, sorry I couldn't think of the right word when I was typing it out. The candles, incense, the pictures of Gods and Goddesses, the clothing, and calling himself a wizard or witch. He wants the aesthetic for the online clout. My family is very accepting of other religions so I know that it's not the environment we're in."

WiccaKnowledgeSeekers,fp14hoo,t1_fp147ox,1588224169.0,"Yes, it's not very ethical to cast a spell like that without permission or any spell for that reason. Just remember to tell them that doing the spell won't hurt anyone or anything and that you only want the best for them. Best of luck!"
WiccaKnowledgeSeekers,fp145b7,t3_gapeth,1588223898.0,Be sure that they are consenting to the spell and make sure that the spell isn't hurting anyone or anything. I hope the spell works well for your friend!

Also when I was in sixth grade, we had a seventh grader get pregnant. She disappeared after she had the kid."

Many people do have undiagnosed depression but I have seen too many people take advantage of it. I'll believe the person that says that they have undiagnosed depression until I'm proven wrong. Please talk to people about how you truly feel about everything. Speak up and you'll get the help you need. Stay strong, you are loved, and you got this!"
