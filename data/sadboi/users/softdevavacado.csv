LushCosmetics,f34qjja,t3_dfbyyj,1570658333.0,I specifically asked for samples and got them this time but last time I forgot to ask and just got my conditioner and no samples. Ordering from the UK site both times.

LushCosmetics,f342v4b,t1_f3428h2,1570649477.0,"I was curious about Presidents Hat! 

I went and smelled Happy again and I think it's actually Blue Raspberry Jones Soda. Theres this fizzy scent in there. But sweet."
LushCosmetics,f341bub,t1_f33zfuj,1570648928.0,"Oh no! I'm in Kentucky and mine dispatched the 1st. I hope your package finds you soon! 

I love it all. 

Cookie Dough is a gritty batter of vanilla and almond that left me smoother and more hydrated than anything I've used at Lush. It melts into your skin as you scrub and a little goes a long way. 

Kerbside Violet. Sweet summers, its divine. The consistency is light but deep and it spread easily. Scent still going strong but not heady (I can smell me but mister sitting next to me doesnt always smell it) after a couple of hours. 

Spearmint Bubblegum IT IS. AH! This was so good and so fun. Left me feeling clean and tastes delicious. 

The Wasabi Shampoo was potentially too clarifying. Still air drying so will have to update later. 

Happy was delicious. Reminded me of some kind of candy but I cant find it exactly. 

Honorable Mention goes to Candy Rain who isn't pictured and was ordered by herself I was so excited ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¥° That conditioner has changed my hair game and I'm so happy to use it. R&B had been my only staple and nothing else was working and then BAM. Candy Rain leaves my curls so soft and fluffy."

trees,eu93rzj,t3_cfd98t,1563571014.0,"What a sweet idea! Either a pencil case bag or a makeup bag would be a great reference. Especially if it's just a grinder, bowl stash situation."
LushCosmetics,es9t5vt,t3_c6mr2k,1561743931.0,"The solid blonde shampoo in 2009, I think."
AmItheAsshole,ereiz0q,t3_c1oae2,1560785292.0,"NTA 

The benefits of your card are for you. Just no. I furthermore cant image asking a friend to put a $500 tab on their credit card and then wanting to be a petty brat about paying them back over the 2% cash back they get. Ditch your friend, btw."
AmItheAsshole,erei8po,t3_c1nw6l,1560784771.0,"NTA

Its straight up rude for friends and family to not believe you and Sam and instead want to believe their own fairy tale."

LushCosmetics,eodr7ld,t3_brguej,1558479153.0,Get it. It will definitely help with the congestion and it's not as exfoliating as cup o coffee IMO. 1000 Millihelens is another great one for clearing up your face if you're worried about a scrub.
pokemon,eodqzlu,t3_bra9ds,1558479004.0,Brilliant! Beautifully done.
