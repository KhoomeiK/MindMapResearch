TrueChristian,foun7w8,t1_fouktk7,1588087110.0,"I’ll start with Mom. My poor mama, she became a true believer when I was born. She tried really hard to pass that to my brother and I. The day after Jesus revealed Himself to me I went to my Mom’s to share. It’s hard to describe the healing of our relationship. We’ve always had a really good relationship, but things are even better now. Add Jesus to any relationship and the results are pretty amazing. 

My ex and my children. When I started to wake up to God, she chose a different path. This world has a lot of enticing roads to wander down. Unfortunately things went down adulterous roads and I can’t go back to that. So I’ll be living a similar Christian life to my mother. An ex and some children to desperately pray for. My own path gives me a lot of hope. If Jesus could grab me, He can grab aaaaaaanyone! 

The tough truth. While out in the wilderness for all those years I made a lot of friends. 99% of the people that I hold dearest are so far from the truth. So the enemy has worked pretty hard to whack me around through those people. It’s lame, but my God is greater."

TrueChristian,fot8567,t1_fot1ins,1588046858.0,"So I’m gonna start by dropping this bomb of a line. 

Matthew 7:7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you

You’re already asking, it sounds like you’re looking for a some insight on how to seek. We sound like similar atheists. I had to tackle this from a very logical and analytical place. I brought my science brain to the table. 

First off, I wanted to get rid of any variables. Basically people. I didn’t want the pastor to guide me, my mom to tell me which book, or really anyone else’s thoughts on any of it. I wasn’t about to be manipulated into believing in Jesus. 

So I picked up a Bible online and tried to simply read it. But that didn’t seem fast enough. I can use headphones at work. So audible made sense. I grabbed the KJV on audible. Also the One Year Bible by Dr Bill Creasy. So now I’m set with a few different options on how to get this book into my noggin. I think this part was critical, it’s so much information to ingest, you know your learning style. I really advocate for Dr Creasy’s One Year Bible. I didn’t feel preached at through any of it. He also does a great job educating you about the historical context, geography and cultures of the time. It doesn’t go through every verse, but it’s a wonderful start. 

Prayer was uncomfortable in the beginning. But it’s part of this big crazy process. It starts out as talking to yourself. Then it finds a more honest and heart searching voice. You can lie to yourself but you can’t lie to God. The constant conversation that is prayer will bring you to some places you didn’t know about. It’s all a process. 

My little flow kind of went like this

Atheist - Agnostic - Jew - Secret Christian - Loud Christian - Calm Christian/Ever learning and growing in Christ.
