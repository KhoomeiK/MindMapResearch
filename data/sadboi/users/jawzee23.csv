So I made a basic pie crust that had a bunch of butter and shortening, and then while that was chilling in the fridge I made the filling. 
-Sauté 3 chopped up stalks of celery and 1/4 of an onion, a couple cups of chopped carrots, and chopped up baby yellow potatoes. Add half a stick of salted butter with that and let it cook on low-med. 
-While that cooks, get your rotisserie chicken (or 2 breasts/3 thighs sautéed and seasoned) and chop them up. Add that in with your veggies. At this point I also add about a cup and a half each of frozen peas and corn. While that sautés, get a sauce pan and melt down the other half stick of butter, 1/3 cup flour, 1/2 a cup of halfhalf, and 2 cups of chicken broth. Add seasonings at this point, I put black pepper, garlic salt, seasoned salt, tarragon, some cayenne and some red pepper. Mix it all together and put it all into the crust, cover with the other half of the dough, and brush top with an egg beaten with 1 tbsp of cold water. Bake at 350F for 45-50 mins, or until the top is golden. Let it sit for at least 30 mins if you can!"

The thing is, she was married at the time with this guy she’d been with for 7 years, and he was studying to be a priest. They actually moved to my city from across the country for him to study at this church property. When the church found out she was fraternizing with Satan (im a girl, so double sins), they kicked them back to their state and they got a divorce. My dumb ass kept seeing her until she cheated on me with some teenage boy about 10 years younger than her lol. It was crazy though, I found out at the end she was being controlled by the devil the whole time. We were trying to FaceTime so she could explain but I hung up when she started speaking tongues. 10/10 way to get someone to lose all feelings immediately.

 Then I started putting them on the top of my dresser at the same time with a bunch of seeds and stuff to chew so they’d be distracted. I always had a few layers of gloves on just in case and a glass jar to help separate them nearby, but they were always calm.
Crazy enough, I went to visit family and had friends come to check on them. They sent me a quick video and I saw a flash of black and white together. Turns out they had chewed through the tape on the bars and were just chilling together.
