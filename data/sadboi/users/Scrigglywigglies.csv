Asthma,fpqkasx,t1_fpotnsb,1588824800.0,"I was diagnosed with physical/allergy induced asthma as a kid as well, I haven't needed an inhaler for quite some time.  Now I haven't  been the most physical throughout my life, I've recently lost a ton of weight and I have started running outside over the last couple of weeks.  I have definitely been coughing up phlegm as well, once I do so it feels much better. 
 Saying that, there has been a definite decrease from day one to now, it's very minimal and seems to be due to the regular exercise as far as I can tell"
Asthma,fpqj84g,t3_ge7qy2,1588824062.0,"Not a doctor, but from experience I believe it's possible. I was diagnosed with physical induced asthma as a kid around 12-13 and hard to carry an inhaler around regularly, may not be the same thing as what you had.  I havent had any issues since 16-17, 26 now.and I'm starting to get back into better physical shape, running quite frequently outside, but hadn't had any issues with my breathing anywhere close to when I was a kid. So I may very well be in a similar boat."

Anxiety,fpc6fue,t3_gckal9,1588489177.0,"Yes 100% I do. I think back to who I in the past, and there are major events that split me up into categories. I judge my past self hardcore.  But I do take it as a positive thing.  Looking back in some ways I acted and treated people makes me cringe, I'm disgusted with prior me. 

However I do take it as a sign of positivity and growth. I'm learning, hopefully I'll be a better person tomorrow then I am today. I don't fully love myself but I do like myself more the back then. And in 2 years when I look back at current me, I hope I feel the same."
Anxiety,fp7fk4e,t1_fp6sn42,1588369685.0,"I'm glad I'm not the only one. I called 911 this morning, I woke up at 5 am and had a panic attack, I was able to fight through it and eventually fall back asleep. Then at 9 am I woke up again and had another one but all throughout the night my left arm has been feeling numb. I was totally incoherent couldn't function or do anything other then call them.  Of course... It was another panick attack, oddly enough I feel much better, went for a doctor checkup- and par for the course everything is just fine. 

Finally going to go see a therapist about this stuff, haven't been to one since a young teenager but enough is enough."

Anxiety,fopswl2,t1_fopdz7k,1587971058.0,"Thanks! I appreciate the insight, it atleast makes me feel a bit better knowing I'm not the only one."
loseit,fn2ib4c,t3_fyw4rz,1586590034.0,"I'm a ex very fat still fattish guy.  At my Max I was about 360, I'm currently 250.  If it's any help I started the exact same way! Intermittent fasting definitely helped me tons, I still do it to this day and love it! 

The attitude that you have is exactly what I needed to start.   No excuses, they don't get you anywhere.  You can definitely do this! Even if it's baby steps every day make the effort to live healthier. It's absolutely amazing how different you will feel if you keep at it!

It's going to be rough, there will be ups and downs but don't give up! You got this!!!"
