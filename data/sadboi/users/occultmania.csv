BPDrecovery,fh2r6at,t1_fgri3os,1581259798.0,"'before' is a long 15 years or so of continuous self harm, disordered eating, and suicide attempts while trying to get my life together. i can think of two ways in which ive gotten better. i rarely dissociate now when before i would have this out of body dream sensation for days. and ive stopped cutting, although my arms are permanently scarred all the way up to the shoulder. its embarrassing knowing people are staring at me but i dont do it anymore. im also not as hard on myself as i used to be. i dont restrict or purge anymore. i dont spend myself into bankruptcy every month. my relationship with my dad is now one of the healthiest in my life when previously he would constantly tell me all the ways i was a fucked up idiot who could never work or study. today i realize that he hasnt changed at all (hes incredibly stubborn) but that hes reacting to MY changes over the years and thats incredibly validating. 

basically, before my life was a haze. i couldnt imagine living past 30 (im turning 30 in a few months, so we'll see). when i thought about the future, it was black. i only saw black in my minds eye. i thought everyone was like that. today i can make plans in the short and medium term though im starting to make long term plans too. my mood has mostly stabilized and ive gone from being on four daily medications at once to only two, an SNRI and a sleep aid (my insomnia hasnt improved at all since i was about six). and i am starting to know who i am.

basically....its pretty dramatic. im living alone now whereas five years ago i was in a mental institution. i commute whereas before i was terrified of getting on the train by myself. sorry if this is a bit disjointed, theres just so much i dont remember for some reason. my memory has gotten dramatically worse over the years and there are huge parts of my life i have no recollection of. but i think maybe thats a good thing all things considering."

in my experience, kindles are perfect for people who can't decide what they're going to read. Instead of being trapped on a commute reading a book you ended up not really liking, you can just read something else. And I can't stress enough how useful it is for readers with commutes. My back used to ache from all the books I carried around.

I like books just as well, especially for annotating and highlighting (I'm one of those people who marks up her books while reading) and the Kindle isn't really that great for writing notes. That's my only real complaint honestly. I'd go for a kindle if you're anything like me."
