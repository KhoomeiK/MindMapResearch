bipolar,f5wwxx3,t3_dp4nwq,1572531918.0,Yesterday I got a new comp plan for my job. We needed it and I have been on my meds for two years. And the consistency I have had over the last two years has let me tap into my potential. I just stay vigilant of this disorder and tell loves ones what I’m experiencing so they can understand my behaviors if they are off.

That’s my mindset, but I do like people being straight forward with me. So, again thank you for commenting."

RealEstate,ex33f39,t1_ex2wjwr,1565979552.0,"If the unit is R22 that compressor will not be cheap. They don’t even make R22 refrigerant any more. Just something to think about. My customer I’m working with now had a 13 year old packaged unit, r22, bad compressor, home warranty tried to deny the claim. I got involved and now we are getting her $3400 to put towards a new system. That includes the old refrigerant. 

Let me know if I can help you with this, dm me with questions."
RealEstate,ex2u7iv,t3_cr4uoy,1565975375.0,"So I sell real estate AND our family owns a large AC company. I sell for both companies and I can tell you, on the contractor side, they are a nightmare. They never want to pay out, they send their own “trusted contractors” and they will tell the customers some crap and blame it on poor maintenance and not normal wear and tear. I then have to go back out and diagnose it again and fight with them.

EDIT: HAVE ANOTHER COMPANY COME DIAGNOSE IT, AND THEN HAVE THEM CREDIT THE REPAIR COST TOWARDS A NEW SYSTEM. IM DOING IT RIGHT NOW WITH ANOTHER COMPANY."
RealEstate,ewto4vo,t3_cq2bnz,1565749868.0,"If you aren’t comfortable, then yes you need to dump her. You need to have the confidence to put yourself first and get away from her. Find you someone that better pairs with your personality. Wish you the best. Trust your gut."

BipolarReddit,evvp2er,t3_clcvq5,1564843596.0,"Don’t worry. I lost my shit on America Airlines one day and decided to change my twitter name to “American Airlines is a dumpster fire” and posted 40-50 retweets and posts bashing them and then they messaged me and I began to broadcast that conversation. I haven’t even logged back in to change it cause I’m so embarrassed..... and they deserve it.

Just stay positive and focus a lot on self awareness. I truly believe an increased self awareness can help channel your mind to work against its intuition."

bipolar,evg8o8r,t1_evffkrw,1564507240.0,"Whoa, so you can’t work in psychology or with people if you are diagnosed bipolar? Interesting."
BipolarReddit,evfc84s,t1_ev6tpl0,1564493158.0,Thank you. I will message you!
BipolarReddit,evfc52a,t1_ev7puls,1564493111.0,Hang with it. You won’t flee you’re going to be a great influence in their life.
BipolarReddit,evfc2g8,t1_ev7xwmb,1564493070.0,Thanks for sharing. This was very helpful.
BipolarReddit,eveyitt,t3_cjd4b6,1564483345.0,This is going to be tough at times. And you will second guess yourself a lot. But the only true way to fight this is by having the highest level of self awareness. Get your closest friends involved to help watch you. I went to college undiagnosed and had some serious struggles because I didn’t know what was going on mentally. Take it seriously but don’t forget to enjoy the ride. It’s all about being positive.
BipolarReddit,ev2nhvz,t1_ev2fzz3,1564180279.0,Thanks for the candidness. Why is that?
BipolarReddit,ev0t6n7,t3_chw121,1564146100.0,"Keep your head up. Listen to books about having a better attitude. Sounds hokey but it works for me. I just ride around listening to books on tape at work. I’m in the truck 5 hours a day, you may not have that opportunity but you can start everyday with a couple pages out of a book. Cut out the tv and work on your mindset. It’s the hand you’re dealt. Play the game."

BipolarReddit,euwrrii,t1_euvuojy,1564078774.0,"It is scarier now cause I know these feelings mad normally I would be me about to go off the deep end. But I haven’t had it escalate much past the accelerated energy and the racing thoughts. Sleep has changed as well, but I’m freaked out cause I don’t want to, or can afford to, lose it again."
BipolarReddit,euuthph,t3_ch67d2,1564050393.0,"I can see why you’re frustrated, but if you don’t throw positivity at this you won’t be able to turn it into something positive. Yeah, I don’t believe in calling this a super power, however, lately I’ve been listening to books about mindset and having a good attitude and it’s helped me tremendously. Don’t focus on the negative, my best friend told me “you play the cards you’re dealt, that’s the game”"
