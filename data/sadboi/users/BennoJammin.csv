taoism,fadvbre,t3_e8gdru,1575987282.0,"I really like your analogy and it gets to the heart of some interesting questions and core truths about tao 

especially the unknownabilty of tao 

But my main criticism is the lack of control given to human

You don't just choose to swim for and against the current, you could swim ,up, down do a little spin choose certain forks in the river

It is the path you choose to go down

,you have action inherent to your consciousness, that's why our action must be controlled 

We choose to follow tao ,we choose to improve our lives 

It doesn't just happen"

And this probably influences the way they talk to you in hevHope of push you into the right direction 

It's fine to believe this because this is how people operate, that's just human social interaction 
We all have are own beliefs and desires, 

But do you see how you made extreme leaps of logic by believing it's one truth or how a bunch of people are in on it 

How they are lying to you ,acting, trying to trick you 
These are paranoid thoughts ,twisted versions, 
you take normal human behaviour and make it villainous

schizoaffective,erxa7tp,t3_c4lrjj,1561378579.0,"See the problem is most modern religions are greedy and manipulative and drown you in doctrine 

But that doesn't you cant believe in God or have a religion aspect to your life you just need to be careful 

The no.1 rule to choosing religion is to pick one that is accepting of reality, one where face with the truth embraces it with open arms and holds all beliefs with a grain of doubt 

The one I chose was zen and Buddhism personal harmony with the world ,    but this grow out of personal religion which is self defined faith 

You could have personal God a personal faith that's doesn't need to be share be understood or true 

All religions started with a mad man (or woman ) coming up with a great idea for how to live a good life .

Whatever you  come up with so long as it helps you and and sticks to the no.1 rule your fine 

Just because your schizophrenic doesn't mean you're force to live in a nihilistic reality :)
