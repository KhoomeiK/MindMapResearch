OCPoetry,etgcvi2,t3_cb8l3t,1562788309.0,Love the honesty and power that this poem has - it feels deeply personal and is greatly affecting. It is also brilliant for addressing the stigma of male depression and it's the perception of such in our current society. Really great work! :))
OCPoetry,etgcm62,t3_cblani,1562788162.0,"I really like this, it has a tenderness to it that maintains the sense of nostalgia that, in my view, the speaker is addressing, while equally being a bittersweet eulogy for what has been lost. Oddly enough it reminds me of *A Soft-Edged Reed of Light* by Julia Copus. The only part I would alter slightly is the final line, maybe to make it a bit less jarring (either way it has a good effect though!) :))"
