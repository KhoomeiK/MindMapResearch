BipolarReddit,fdnieqx,t3_em8xjh,1578586459.0,Yes and then I started thinking I could talk to insects
bipolar,fd5gzdm,t1_fd4cdp5,1578177535.0,That actually sounds beautiful. Is it frightening?
bipolar,fd0x75c,t1_fd0we43,1578124980.0,"I’m really grateful for your message! I just want to stay here in the happy place. Luckily I am actually seeing a nurse on weds and I will try to get a doc appointment. I live in the U.K. and have to get a new psych referral (takes months) to see a specialist because I was stable for nearly 3 years and relocated three times during this so that makes it hard to access support. But my GP is super nice, despite telling me to take Citalopram at night? But I know better so that’s ok."
bipolar,fd0tyn2,t1_fd0t91v,1578123723.0,"Thanks - well I am having obsessive thoughts about really mundane things and doing a lot of online shopping, but I am recognising this and leaving carts full of stuff not going the extra mile to buy it. These are all positive things, and maybe things I need in my life as I don’t really have a vast amount of luxury- such as I don’t have a bowl in the kitchen only plates so I decided I need a dinner set. Which is true. But I will hold off until a month just in case I am being extravagant. I have gone back to work last week and spent time with friends and family over Christmas. I skipped meds Christmas Day so I could enjoy the whole of the day and have a drink, which was really nice. I know that’s a bit risky. But usually when I am hypomanic I am way more energetic and hyper social. Maybe this is just how it feels to meet someone really special? Obviously bipolar brings doubt to every feeling not governed by strict logic."
bipolar,fd0t0u7,t1_fczi2ut,1578123357.0,"How about a fresh start, a change of location? I’m not a role model by any means but it has really helped me when things in my life have stagnated and I felt trapped, I moved to the other side of the country and got a new job and it’s a cheaper cost of living here. Really helped me."
bipolar,fd0sec7,t1_fczahfa,1578123114.0,"It will pass. Try to make small healthy choices. Life goes on outside of you and you can pick it up again after the depression has gone. You wouldn’t shame someone for having to spend time recharging if they had flu so don’t beat yourself up for having depression, but listen to that shame as a part of you remembering that this is not your normal and it is not how it will always be. Sending you some strength and I hope the light reaches you in your darkness xx"
bipolar,fd0s01d,t3_ejng4r,1578122963.0,"A very boring one- obsessive online shopping for ironing boards. I just can’t find the perfect one. I have looked up every spec for one. I have even investigated how to build my own one, as I am interested in permaculture. Everything I see I think ‘wow that would make a good ironing board’. 

I suppose not all intrusive thoughts are violent or self-violent. I am also lucky enough that I have recognised that this borders on obsession and have postponed buying one until one month in case it’s only a fleeting obsession. I tend to get this when I’m coming up and start loads of projects I can’t finish or afford."
bipolar,fd0pfak,t3_ejoijn,1578121984.0,In the past I have been sat on the floor of my room with all the lights off holding a knife because someone is coming for me... and the whole room feels like it’s moving because I’m hyper conscious of everything. Not sure if mania or hypomania but if anyone ever says to me the highs of bipolar is fun I might sock them one.
godtiersuperpowers,falmka5,t3_e9lpek,1576186870.0,That’s so kind!
Dreams,fallg1b,t3_e9rfku,1576186329.0,This is amazing- not sure what it’s about but what an insight into all your senses!
BipolarReddit,f89udtz,t3_dzrr83,1574380341.0,Running on a treadmill for a couple of hours a day and finding ways to channel energy through creative things like music or art really helps. Make sure you stick to your bedtimes though in case this is the start of a mood shift.
bipolar,f84ikki,t3_dyvdwd,1574250243.0,I feel intensely insatiably hungry at times and binge eat. This is usually one of the first signs for me of oncoming mood changes one way or the other.
Nurse,f7vje75,t1_f7trtab,1574024229.0,You got any helpful links where I can learn more about this? Really interesting!
Nurse,f7vivem,t1_f7tqqaq,1574024132.0,"It’s really hard seeing how staff who don’t understand label patients who have a history with their mental health and make assumptions before asking people what they need, and I’ve seen patients on medical wards have their emotional needs ignored because ‘oh it’s because they have bipolar’ rather than be listened to as another patient without a label would be. I do think most nurses have the right attitude, but there’s a lot of accidental discrimination. I suppose our job is to advocate and challenge this where possible."
Nurse,f7vi2wo,t3_dxn604,1574023888.0,"Student here- Would also be interested in hearing how people cope, because I find the lack of structure in shift patterns (doing a mix of days and nights and working in lots of places irregularly) is having a big impact on the routine I have in my life to keep me stable. This involves regulating my diet, exercising, staying away from drugs and drink and meditating every day. It is difficult to maintain my routine because I have to get up at 5.30am and back home 9pm if I’m doing days. And it works out as at least 6 days a week of work- which means I often end up more hyperactive and not sleeping much because I’m fuelled by the stress. I’ve found myself gaining weight and also having more little mood swings which I’m scared of becoming big mood swings. It’s going ok though, I know people without Bipolar who are having a rougher time emotionally because of the workload and stress. Anyway. That wasn’t helpful to you OP, but I’m definitely going to follow this post."
thanksimcured,f7hovi9,t3_drieew,1573744811.0,That is literally the definition of stress- when the demands of a task outweigh the persons ability to perform it effectively

gatesopencomeonin,f7e1hv6,t3_dv5fxb,1573641732.0,I think that’s called a silver fox
insanepeoplefacebook,f6r0f1g,t3_dsi7no,1573090580.0,Actually is anyone going to address the issue that generally we need more seats on public transport? Then maybe nobody would have to stand and everyone could sit down.

travel,eu91ij7,t1_eu80rav,1563569537.0,I used to work on parliament street and everyone said it was haunted. There are lots of pigeons living in the top floor/ attic. Is it true it used to belong to people involved in the slave trade?
