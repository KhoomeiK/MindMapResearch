So I do believe this kitty may have been a pet, yes, but he's most likely not owned by anyone else but this loving couple. A concerned owner would have put out missing posts, contacted vets, anything like that. Clearly nobody did. Is it really that hard to believe that there are cruel people who do heartless things to pets? Such as abandonment and cruelty. I believe that this cat is with its rightful owners right now."

Losing so much weight and controlling my diabetes as well as limiting my food intake with sheer willpower, I was immensely proud of my current weight. I do understand that people are different and they thrive on different weights and they have different goals/different expectations for their own weight and bodies, but as someone who personally think her current weight is FANTASTIC & felt great about her body for the first time in 10 years, seeing almost everyone my height comment that it's ""Disgusting"" and ""made them feel awful about themselves"" and ""It's way too heavy for that height"" absolutely made me feel like I shouldn't be proud of nor happy about my current weight. I also feel like me defending my weight counts as fatlogic, which is the opposite of what I want. My ""recommended weight"" is 48 - 62kg, and 62 Is actually an okay weight for me, in my opinion, but 48!?!? Holy fuck, that sounds insane! So of course, I still feel like I'm not doing good still and even if I'm really proud of beating my Binge eating disorder, I'm actually scared I'm heading towards another eating disorder because of my recent obsession with my weight and body. I know everyone says ""you shouldn't compare yourself to others"" and that IS correct, but when I read that my current weight isn't even near good enough and that people seem to find it disgusting and outline that it's unacceptable, well, I just can't help it."

SelfCareCharts,fn9irl0,t3_g00vax,1586774592.0,"Yes. As a type 2 diabetic & a recovering binge eater, who literally *has* to lose weight in addition to limit my sugar intake and can't afford to eat huge amounts of sugary foods and high calorie foods, I absolutely think I should ""stop being a dick to my body"" by eating as much as possible this Easter.

Yes I know this doesn't apply to everyone, but in my opinion, being a dick to my body would be doing just this. I'm being a big pessimist I know, but still. Yes, you should absolutely enjoy yourself during Easter, and not worry about your weight and calorie intake too much. But Not all of us can just ""let go and just enjoy ourselves"" without it having consequences.

Edit: Everything in moderation, unless, like me, you're an addict or whatever you're indulging is really bad for you, and can cause relapse. I don't want to go back to binge eating and I don't want to let my blood sugar get out of control. (I actually do eat candies during Easter, but in very, very small amounts and not too often. I had 2 Easter eggs yesterday, for example! Didn't worry about that. Just wanted to add my personal opinion. I'm kinda mad I can't eat all I want.)"

I even sometimes write them down so I can look at them when I feel useless and talentless. I also take pictures of things I've achieved/made/done and look at them. For example my 15 kg weight loss. I've also hung my hunting licence exam paper on my wall. I put my achievements all around me to remind me, I'm not in fact a useless failure. And these things took literally years to achieve.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fmb8x6e,t3_fu2af4,1585921306.0,"I'll sound like a total hippie for this, but I think there's no specific way of being ""feminine"". I stopped wearing makeup a long time ago, but I also started (very recently) to wash my skin with a gentle cleanser for sensitive skin. That alone makes *me* feel feminine. Brushing my teeth and hair every day, eating a healthy breakfast, taking a shower and using a mild soap that smells faintly fruity, makes me feel feminine. Doing basic self-care by taking care of my physical appearance and health. I sometimes wear tight tops with a cleavage, plus tights with lace panties, and sometimes I wear my bf's PJ pants and my own oversized Nintendo 64 hoodie (right now, actually!). My face is clean, I recently dyed my hair stripe (one red stripe in my black hair) and I'm wearing super cute ankle socks. I feel really damn feminine, because I embrace that I'm a beautiful woman no matter what I wear. And by the way, you may not smell it, but women in general have pheromones that makes your natural scent smell much better to the opposite sex/same sex. I don't wear perfume because my bf loves my scent (I do wear deodorant!) These things are things I do that make *me* feel comfortable and feminine. You may not feel the same way, doing what I do. My point here, as long as what you do makes you feel happy, confident, beautiful and content, then I'm sure you'll feel like the beautiful feminine Goddess you absolutely are no matter what you wear or look like. 

I know I'm not ""Very feminine"" here, but my personal opinion is that femininity is very subjective. If you feel you're feminine, you ARE. That goes for literally all genders. I think it's more about attitude and how you carry yourself, and how you feel, rather than how others see you.

Do you scream at strangers online for having a non traditional relationship that you literally aren't involved in? Do you know the difference between consent and non consent? If you know & approve of your partner fucking some random stranger in the ass, then it's between you and your partner and isn't defined as infidelity. Being upfront and honest about your relationships isn't cheating. Going behind your partner's back and fucking someone else is the literal definition of cheating. 

Lack of self-respect is to let someone else do things to your body or person because you don't think you deserve better or that you don't care about yourself. To literally let others define your worth and do what others think you should do without regarding yourself or what is good for you & your body. And I can't imagine being so involved in someone else's sexlife that you try to define what is and isn't okay, in something that you literally have no business deciding what's morally right. Why don't you just focus on deciding what you want your own relationship to be like, between you and your partner? 

Oh wait, I'm guessing the reason why you're so involved in someone else's sexlife is because you literally don't have one yourself and try living vicariously through them."
