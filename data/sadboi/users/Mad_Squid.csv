australia,fpmzuzk,t1_fplb013,1588746114.0,"I only have the essentials package on Foxtel Now so I can watch HBO shows. I pay almost twice what I do for Netflix because you have to pay for all the reality TV crap as well and all I'm really watching on it at the moment is the new season of Westworld. I'm watching a shit load more on Netflix and even Disney Plus which is like $8 a month.

It's frustrating that they charge a lot more than other streaming services (it's over $100 a month for all the packages) but aren't even as good. You can't download content to your device and half of their shows aren't on demand so you have to watch it live, which they have the audacity to chock full with adds after charging you a shit ton. If HBO had its own streaming site in Australia I'd really have no reason for Foxtel at all."

They're a timeless classic in my opinion and they're great for getting young kids into gaming. My 6 year old niece really got into Lego Batman 3. It's one of the few games she can actually play haha She kicks my arse in Injustice II by button mashing and likes playing one of the numerous racing games with no races (she just likes to drive around, crash and laugh maniacally) but the Lego games are really helping her with her skills and since they're puzzle games they're probably good for a developing brain."
