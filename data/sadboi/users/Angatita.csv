Your employer will have to accommodate to avoid discrimination bs.
Anxiety,fr00oxq,t1_fqzwcgh,1589780368.0,"Well I can only really elaborate on my personal experience and what I learned but it‚Äôs pretty similar. 

CBT basically teaches you how to be aware of your thought patterns by noticing your specific triggers or times of day where your anxiety is the worst. You learn to ask yourself ‚ÄúWhat am I anxious about?‚Äù then file it away to go over later when you aren‚Äôt in that state. You then give yourself new language like ‚ÄúI forgive myself for ____‚Äù or ‚ÄúI did my best in that situation‚Äù or for irrational fear anxieties just learn how to use logic and information. 

The therapist usually starts with a low level anxiety that‚Äôs around a lot and over time dives deeper into the root cause or the ‚Äúdriver‚Äù of that anxiety. 

So one for me is driving anxiety. I was in an accident a few years back that wasn‚Äôt even that bad (driver rear ended me going about 20 while I was stopped) but it just flipped me on my head SO badly. I was suddenly hyper aware of everything because even though I drove super cautiously, suddenly I was aware that I couldn‚Äôt predict other drivers around me. 

So that therapy line went something like:

Base anxiety: driving
Why: because of the accident
Why: because I‚Äôm scared of it happening again
Why (deeper): because I can‚Äôt control other drivers 
Base of that anxiety: lack of control
Combat the anxiety: what CAN I control?
I can control my own car and my own reactions. I can stay as vigilant as possible and drive carefully to decrease my chances of getting in an accident. I can turn on music to distract my thoughts or listen to a podcast. If I start going down a train of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù I need to stay aware so I can tell myself that isn‚Äôt going to help me in the moment and focus back on what I need to. 

Then from that point it turns into exposure therapy. I do those things to be able to drive without anxiety in the moment, then over time with repeated incidents of no accidents, the anxiety can start to fade away over time. 

It‚Äôs still there and will be triggered if there‚Äôs a slowdown on the freeway, but in general I don‚Äôt have a panic attack just driving to the grocery store anymore. 

I feel like that was all over the place but that‚Äôs kind of the general gist of my therapy."

When anxiety gets so bad that you can‚Äôt even function day to day then that‚Äôs absolutely when you need to reach out for professional help. There‚Äôs so much stigma attached to going to see a therapist but honestly there would be so much less mental suffering in the world if people would get the help they need. 

I‚Äôm a longtime sufferer of anxiety (mine manifests as playing out different scenarios of how I could die or be seriously injured complete with sound, sight, and even feeling sometimes) and CBT with hypnotherapy has been an absolute godsend. I absolutely notice a difference and the mindfulness training keeps me from running down thought trails by catching them when they start."

 ‚Äúyes I made a mistake, but I‚Äôve learned and I‚Äôve grown from this to be a better person today.

Change that up to suit your personal experience and it WILL take multiple times of doing it to start to feel any kind of relief but keep at it. Mind over matter is a very powerful tool especially with anxiety.

My grooming table I got was about $60. It‚Äôs shorter than what I‚Äôd like but it works! 

Any any tips or tricks you can give are much appreciated! The only ‚Äútraining‚Äù I have are YouTube videos at this point lol. And his double coat will be growing in soon (Havanese) so I‚Äôm planning on keeping him super short. (12mm guard)"
puppy101,fqeh0vg,t3_gif1wz,1589307415.0,"Second exhaustion! Just be glad pup is deciding to sleep instead of being a demon hellapawn and taking out the tantrum on your hands or carpet lol. If the fatigue persists, just give your vet a call, it won‚Äôt hurt anything (calls are usually free!) :)"
puppy101,fqego9z,t1_fqec8ke,1589307250.0,6 months is also the start of the second fear period where they‚Äôll be much more hyper alert of everything around them. Just reward the heck out of neutral behavior when pup sees another person and don‚Äôt force any interactions with strangers. The comment above has some really awesome advice too :)
puppy101,fqegdqi,t1_fqefzzd,1589307111.0,"If you do the training with feeding time, using the kibble as the reward you can usually get a much longer attention span. When pup is tired then you reward them for the training with the rest of the kibble"
puppy101,fqeg88o,t1_fqefzzd,1589307037.0,"At that age, 5-10 min is all they can usually give. Try and stop the training before pup gets to that point and give them something to chew on like a bully sick or frozen Kong then do another session in a few hours."
puppy101,fqeg0o1,t1_fqeed90,1589306938.0,"Still call up your vet, it doesn‚Äôt cost anything for a phone consult. See if it might be the watermelon (probably is) but you want to be more safe than sorry :)"
puppy101,fqefwqt,t3_gifrvn,1589306886.0,Yup I second possible UTI. Call up your vet just to be safe! Better to catch it early than let it keep going and get into the kidneys.
puppy101,fqefosy,t1_fqeerme,1589306782.0,Absolutely lol. I‚Äôm going through that right now. Pup has some diarrhea and I‚Äôm like PARASITES CANCER PANCREATITIS OH GOD HIS LIVer is FAILING...**deeeeep breath** ...no he just ate a clod of dirt yesterday like a dumb dumb. He‚Äôll be fine.
puppy101,fqefcmo,t3_gig36p,1589306621.0,"Don‚Äôt underestimate brain games and training! This breed is highly intelligent and just physical exercise will never be enough. Invest in puzzle toys, make your own homemade ones, try [shape training](https://youtu.be/ZnTv4WO-hz4) , do nose work (find it command), teach some agility(weave through legs, walk around object - though this one might be too complicated for her age right now, wait a few weeks), emotional control exercises (take it, leave it, drop it, wait/stay) 

Mental exercises like this can equate to a 30 min brisk walk in terms of tiring out pup. Just think about how tired you are after a puzzle, or anything that takes concentration. You haven‚Äôt moved barely at all but sometimes it‚Äôll wipe you out :)"
puppy101,fqeench,t3_gigbtk,1589306291.0,"New home blues. Give him some time, as long as he‚Äôs drinking and eating at least something he‚Äôs fine. It might take him another day or two to be fully back to eating. Just keep the consistent schedule :)"
dogs,fqee472,t1_fqdakhg,1589306044.0,"Oh GOD poop puke is absolutely the most VILE smell on the entire planet!!!! I feel so bad for you and wouldn‚Äôt wish that smell on my worst enemy! 

We had a dog at our doggy daycare that was a poop eating fanatic, he would eat it AS it was coming out. We‚Äôd try to always stop him but he was sneaky and with 2 people to 50 dogs we couldn‚Äôt keep an eye on him all the time. 

If he got too much poop he would vomit and oh my god the SMELL. Even the dogs would all bolt, crowd outdoors and look inside like ‚Äúwhat the hell?‚Äù My coworkers and I would play Rock Paper Scissors as to who had to go back in and clean it up/sanitize the area ugh."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fqec6n8,t3_gi2ps2,1589305154.0,"Could be a series of deja vu when your brain fires incorrectly in the memories section making you feel like you‚Äôve seen it before and even sometimes continuing for a while giving you the sense that you know what‚Äôs going to happen. 

Scientific studies have shown that this phenomenon is benign and different people experience it differently and to varying degrees. 

There‚Äôs a man they‚Äôre studying who‚Äôs in a constant state of dejavu, that part of his brain is just always on and they don‚Äôt know why. But the guy feels like he knows everything that‚Äôs going to happen all the time because he‚Äôs lived it before when that obviously isn‚Äôt the case."
puppy101,fqebn6p,t1_fqdv54o,1589304901.0,Definitely a fluke at that age lol but such a good girl!
puppy101,fqdzx4h,t3_gi0cc4,1589299460.0,I‚Äôm having to take mine out every 30 minutes lol. I should have gotten a bigger dog. We live on the second floor... my poor legs lol
puppy101,fqdzj1f,t1_fqdm8bo,1589299273.0,"Oh wow training to place their chin is a wonderful idea! Thank you for all the great advice!  

I actually invested in a grooming table with a haunch loop and it made the WORLD of difference. Did the bath and nail trim on a totally separate day and decided to try grooming after a few rounds of fetch. It took a couple times of resetting him but he let me do everything with barely any wiggles! I tried the O method around his muzzle from the other person that responded and he pulled away once but the second time he seemed to realize ‚Äúshe isn‚Äôt gonna let me out of this‚Äù and settled down. I gave him lots of happy praise while I worked around his eyes and he was absolutely perfect :) 

It was great too because he got to see that the stuff I was using didn‚Äôt hurt and it wasn‚Äôt so scary afterall (didn‚Äôt use clippers around his eyes since I wasn‚Äôt comfy with it, just used my roundtipped scissors and he was great)

I did legs last since that‚Äôs his problem area where he gets the most wiggly. I was able to shave two pads and get the majority of his legs even. He‚Äôs still a LITTLE choppy but he was definitely at the end of his tolerance so I freed him until next time. I‚Äôm hoping that with a little more age/emotional control I can get the full groom done in one go!

Dogtraining,fqb9gnp,t1_fqa2905,1589232915.0,This is exactly what I‚Äôm having to do now. My boy just turned 6 months today and used to go on 1-2 mile walks happy as a clam but this last week he‚Äôs just said NOPE with no fear stimulus that i could see. Glad to know this is just normal for that age and he‚Äôll grow out of it with some positive reinforcement
