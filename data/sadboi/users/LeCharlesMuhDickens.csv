Fix the game instead of attacking people that keep finding holes in it.

TBH the grind for certain things in unneeded considering how often Bethesda fucks up something, or makes an item easy to acquire that wasn’t previously rare. Even things like legendary modules are god awful to grind given the payout. You’re not guaranteed a 3 star, and 99/100 rolls are complete garbage. Why should we have to roll for 6 months straight to maybe put together one set of armor that works for our build? At least make the fucking pieces able to be traded so we can swap good rolls we don’t want for the pieces we do want. 

Legacies being nerfed or removed is dumb too. Why do I get punished because you didn’t get something when it was dropping? There’s a lot of duped shit out there, but there’s also a lot of us who grinned the hell out the game since day 1 to get what we were after.
