bipolar,f80cbdi,t1_f7z5act,1574125603.0,I was like that for about several months. I’m not in my field anymore but I got an easy part time job.  Baby steps... it’ll get better!

bipolar,f7g7jkq,t3_dvuanc,1573696574.0,"This is literally my life right now! Graduated Culinary school, got my dream job as a Pastry Chef, worked too much which led to a 10 month mixed episode, quit my job, and I basically just exist now. I haven’t baked in almost a year... I just get through each day but life just feels meaningless and empty"
bipolar,f6kqhch,t3_drj0z3,1572918206.0,Good luck! I’ve been on it for 3 years and I’m pleased with it.
bipolar,f6kpafe,t3_drr9tw,1572917373.0,I’m right there with you. I cooked for the first time in months yesterday. I usually order DoorDash everyday or wait for my sister to bring me food. When I’m having an episode or have anxiety I have a hard time leaving the house. I’m really going to try at this!
bipolar,f0tvvnc,t3_d6h1az,1568929865.0,My period triggers episodes also. My gynecologist lets me rapid pack BC pills. So I take them continuously to avoid having a period. I know it scares a lot of women and they don’t think it’s natural but I haven’t had any problems. When I accidentally skip a pill it’ll just come on it’s on or if I get really stressed out it comes also. It gives me more control over my moods

bipolar,ezc5r1l,t3_d0qudu,1567830318.0,That was the first medication I went on after my diagnosis.  I started lactating not too long after. It got bad to the point where I’d look down and there’d be wet spots on my shirt. It didn’t immediately stop after I got off the risperidone. I went through a few more antipsychotics and the lactation would still come and go. And my breast doubled in size. I really hated it. My doc eventually stopped trying antipsychotics and switched me over to a mood stabilizer (lamictal) and it stopped after a couple of months
bipolar,ewx5qqj,t3_cqgnry,1565845340.0,I lost 48lbs on it. It didn’t start until about 5 months in after they increased my dose to 200mg. It didn’t really bother me because I gained almost 70lbs from the many medications that I tried after my initial diagnosis.
introvert,evxcqid,t3_clnk3h,1564888401.0,Daria was always my favorite.
