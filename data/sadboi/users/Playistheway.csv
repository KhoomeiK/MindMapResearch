getdisciplined,fr35lsi,t1_fr23d6o,1589850416.0,"Apologies for the incoming rant, but: take note of where 'dopamine' arguments around behavioural addiction originate from. It's almost invariably people who are selling courses for how to 'reset' your dopamine through a 'dopamine detox' or 'dopamine fast'. When a 22-year-old YouTuber is referencing neuroscientific concepts, be skeptical. They don't have the requisite skills to parse the literature.

The evidence that stuff like 'dopamine detoxes' have a non-placebo impact is almost non-existent. In truth, the evidence that there's a problem to fix is almost non-existent. Our bodies are extremely efficient at maintaining homeostasis.

It's true that dopamine plays a role in determining whether or not we want something/want to do something, but human motivation (and other animal motivation for that matter), is far more complex. The dopamine model peddled by YouTubers is overly simplistic. People try to generalise insights from cocaine and amphetamine studies, or from studies that directly administer dopamine to the brains of rats, and apply those findings to social media and games. The magnitude of difference is at minimum of hundreds of percent. Picture one or two friends shooting hoops; they'll occasionally score some points. Amphetamines are like thousands of people shooting hoops all at the same time. You damage the hoop itself because the throughput is just that high.

I think one of the best places to start on scientific motivation is reading up on [self-determination theory](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/theory/). It's the most applicable in terms of helping you understand your intrinsic motivation to interact with things that society deems as 'unproductive'."

That's unwise at the best of times, let alone during a global pandemic. Playing video games is a highly efficient strategy for meeting our psychological needs - in particular our needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness. Even self-diagnosed video game addicts often return to video games in healthier moderation (a behaviour you wouldn't expect to see in recovered alcoholics or gamblers). Video games are not inherently bad for you, nor are they bad for your productivity. If anything, video games are actually good for you in the right 'doses'. There is overwhelming evidence that they can increase wellbeing in a variety of ways, and some videogames can decrease risks of depression, anxiety, PTSD and a myriad of other mental health issues.

If you procrastinate with video games, that points to a broader and currently unresolved problem. 

However, if you have cut video games out of your life, at a minimum you are going to have temporary deficiencies of the three 'basic psychological needs' discussed in Self-Determination Theory (competence, autonomy relatedness). Think about non-videogame activities that make you feel competent, and do those. Think about activities that make you feel like you have a good degree of creative control, and do those. Think about activities that make you feel socially connected to others, and do those. If you fail to moderate these three psychological needs, you're going to have a bad time."

getdisciplined,fqyfnqr,t3_gll32d,1589747822.0,"The two core reasons that we are drawn to play video games is because they meet both our 'basic psychological needs' (a term deriving from self-determination theory), and allows us to facilitate our desired mood state (as in mood management theory) through selective exposure to the types of media we want to interact with (selective exposure theory). To succeed in your quest, you should figure out tasks and activities that help you to facilitate your core psychological needs, which are: competence, autonomy and relatedness.

Games are very good at helping us facilitate our psychological need for competence. Games have carefully crafted systems (and sometimes even dynamic systems) that moderate the challenge of a game so that we're put into challenge:skill balance. For a community like r/getdisciplined this is probably ringing some bells. When challenge:skill balance is maintained, you enter into a psychological state called 'Flow'. If you want to become a real life video game character, you're going to need to do actions and activities that help facilitate feelings of competence. In my view, there's nothing that makes you feel more competent than being physically fit. Not only does fitness increase your physical strength, but it also comes with a suite of cognitive benefits.

When it comes to autonomy, this is one that we're solely lacking in real life, but have plenty of in video games. It's no surprise that a game that lets you sculpt the environment like Animal Crossing became hugely popular during a quarantine that subverted our independence so thoroughly. If you want to cultivate feelings of autonomy in real life, I don't think there's anything that gives you a greater sense of freedom than starting your own blog or youtube channel. It becomes a place for you to have a form of creative outlet, showcasing whatever it is that you want to do. Being able to make decisions isn't just an admirable trait in others, it's something that we need to be able to do in order for us to feel fulfilled. Make sure you're not always deferring to others when everyone's trying to decide where to eat.

As for relatedness, that's more-or-less just a fancy way of saying 'socially connected'. A real-life video game character will need to be interacting with plenty of people, many of whom will need your help. If you're at a point in life where you have some valuable skills that you could teach to others, try to find yourself either a formal or informal mentee. That will allow you to pass on your wisdom, and it does wonders for helping you feel engaged with the community. Alternatively, if you're not that far along - try to find a mentor. They will help guide and accelerate your growth.

As for mood, we tend to think we have a pretty intuitive understanding of what activities influence our moods in what way, but the reality is that we're not as great as we might hope. I would strongly encourage you to start a journal, not only to use as a 'quest log', but also to record your moods so that you can get some sense of relationship between the things you're doing and how you're feeling.

I think that not having a mind's eye is a blessing, not a curse. You also don't relive embarrassing moments with the same fidelity that other people do.

I have not seen any scientist peddling 'dopamine detoxes' - only people who profit from selling motivational content online.

Their argument is inherently flawed. If human motivation were as simple as a single neurotransmitter, we'd all just be out slamming amphetamines, endlessly eating chocolate, and jerking off to cat gifs. Obviously the reality is much more complex. You wouldn't assume that an artist is painting a picture for dopamine; you wouldn't assume that a pianist is playing for dopamine; you wouldn't assume a group of children playing tag are just doing it for dopamine. And beyond that, that's not really even how dopamine works.

The idea that games build up a high level of tolerance to dopamine is more-or-less baseless. While it's true that DA2 receptors downregulate when exposed to high levels of dopamine for extended periods of time, that's generally A) a stimuli dependent reaction (i.e. if you eat a lot of chocolate, you'll want less chocolate, but it won't downregulate your desire to watch TV), and B), it's a transient effect. Our bodies are extremely good at maintaining homeostasis. Most people experience a 7-8 hour window each day where they are not engaged in behaviours likely to promote dopaminergic activation. Sleep gives you plenty of time for your body to achieve homeostasis for a wide variety of upregulations and downregulation that occur during day to day life.

If I were to hazard a guess as to why people are playing more games than they'd like to, it's likely because they have unfulfilled psychological needs. Using the Self-Determination Theory model of motivation, those are: competence, autonomy and relatedness. Video games are very good at helping us achieve those psychological needs, and activities that lead to the fulfillment of psychological needs are intrinsically motivating.

It sounds like you played to the point of needs-saturation which then allowed you to take risks and engage in behaviours that could potentially undermine your psychological need for competence (essentially, playing games built you a psychological buffer).

My biggest piece of advice would be: don't be too hard on yourself if you return to playing video games. They get a very bad wrap in 'discipline' and 'productivity' focused subreddits because of all the neurotrash and quackery around dopamine. The reality is that we play games because they're an efficient strategy for meeting our psychological needs.

My second piece of advice is to be mindful of what games you're playing.

Paying a mortgage and maintenance for a property that you're not living in seems absurd. If you're not ready to move into the property that you purchase, it would be more rational to save and invest the money.

My advice would be to get a mortgage on a property when you're closer to moving in. Your rate of return on invested cash will almost always grow faster relative to a mortgage. You should be able to afford that level of risk tolerance since you're only 35.

If you plan on subsidizing your food costs with fishing and gardening, I'd hope that you already have experience with that. I'd also hope that you have a backup plan for when you break your knee at 76 and don't have as much mobility as you used to."

If a star goes supernova and destroys its solar system, is it evil? Certainly not. If a pack of lions eats a gazelle, are they evil? Again, certainly not. Good and evil are human constructs, and only exist where humans are involved. The lack of universality implies that the universe is uncaring about whether or not something is good or evil.

Fortunately, in most circumstances, the consequences for good and evil are also in the realm of human experience. Epicurus argued that morality was just a social construct, but that if you live a life where you steal from others, you will always need to watch over your shoulder.

Polyphasic sleep seems to have some benefits for some people, but it's not something that fits into the vast majority of peoples' lives. It requires both total ownership of your time and immense discipline to follow a polyphasic sleep pattern (you need to fall asleep at the same time every day otherwise you will upset your circadian rhythm). You're also misusing the term polyphasic if you're following a one core sleep and one nap schedule. The poly- prefix implies more than two. You're practicing a biphasic sleep cycle.

Many of Walker's claims about sleep are false. He made up quite a lot of important claims in his book, and tried to obfuscate their made-upness by citing 1000+ page books without chapter or page notes. Heck, Walker's own made-up claims would discourage a polyphasic sleep cycle that adds up to less than 8 hours of sleep per day.

And as for the concept of dopamine detox, it's inherently flawed. There is nothing to detox. There is nothing to clean. There is no realistic way that you're going to reset anything. Unless you're taking cocaine or amphetamines, the very small DA2 downregulation experienced from prolonged increase to natural rewards would reset during sleep. The body is very good at maintaining homeostasis.

If you only lift, you will injure yourself and the pain will become unbearable. If you rest and remain static, you may not be strong enough to hurdle future obstacles. There's a sweet spot where you can gain the ability to overcome obstacles by self-inflicting small amounts of damage and allowing yourself to recover from it.

When you look at Stoic techniques, you have things like negative visualisation - a technique that causes you to experience imagined mental pain to prepare yourself for future trauma. On the other hand, the Epicurean tetraphrmakos is a salve for the soul. When you put self-damage and self-healing together, you at the very least make yourself more resilient.

Prosthetic limbs, hearing aids, and similar quality of life upgrades are all probably in what I call the 'necessary but unnatural' quadrant as well.

I think most of the examples above would be relatively uncontroversial. But things get hazy when you start considering things like supplements. If you followed Epicurus's reasoning, a lot of supplements would be unnatural and unnecessary, despite the probability that taking them will reduce your pain (and thereby increase your capacity for static pleasure).

If you went from being self-motivated to saying ""what's the point"" that hints that something other than a shift in beliefs is impacting your mindset.

One of the biggest factors for why self-isolation may be causing mental health issues is that people are staying inside far more than usual. As a result, many people are not getting enough natural vitamin D. Low levels of vitamin D are associated with negative affect and can lead to depression.

Therefore, everyone has the capacity to *be* good - murderers included.

A vicious person can harm your physical body, but to the Stoics, you are not your body. Couple this with the idea that your body is a thing that is beyond your control. That statement is understandably a little controversial if you adhere to a trichotomy of control rather than a dichotomy of control, but the Stoics of antiquity certainly saw things from a binary position. A murderer cannot harm your character, which (to the Stoics) is your real source of value. Look to sages like Socrates and Epictetus. Their character has lived longer than their physical bodies."
