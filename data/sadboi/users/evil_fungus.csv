I simply refuse to accept the theory of infinite worlds, because I refuse to believe there is an entire universe or a world where there is a better version of me, while it may be true, the lack of any form of interaction with these alternative realities refutes their existence, and my singular mind tells me that whatever I make today, will still be here tomorrow. 

A sense of agency allows me to create moments, artwork, conversation and countless other things at my own volition, I choose to live a good life, by not taking advantage of others, because it is my belief that karmic forces will punish evil people when they believe themselves to be free of judgement."

I think a lot of people are selling images of themselves on instagram which is a bad thing.

I think the app is creating a massive amount of adult material that wouldn't exist otherwise, so it does fuel the sex-trade in a big way.

I think you can post whatever you want, and most people have posted worse content, but the reality is that selling yourself for $3 is so low that you're telling the world that you're worth less than a cup of coffee. For less than a cup of coffee I can see you naked...but on the internet I can see naked for free, so greed and lust and lascivious personalities create the demand, and desperation creates the supply.
