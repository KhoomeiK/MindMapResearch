CBD,fqqc68o,t3_gjskfc,1589562991.0,"Hi there,

I have dealt with severe anxiety and depression since in my teens. I have never taken pharmaceuticals and have only recently been managing these issues with diet, exercise and CBD (recently as in the last 5-7years).  
I have tried several brands - all over the place here in Colorado - but have had best results with Fully Activated 1200mg Full Spectrum Oil. Daily use I take a 1/4 of an eye dropper which is about 10mg. A day that I am having a more difficult day of anxiety, a 1/2 an eye dropper - which is about 20mg. And when I am having a full blown panic attack (complete with hyperventilating) I take a full eye dropper - which is 40mg.  
The days that are overwhelming and I need to take the larger doses, I feel a shift in mood as well as slower hear rate - slower breathing in about 15-20min.  
This brand also shows labs on all their products. They also offer just pure cbd oil - not full spectrum.

Hope that helps -"

CBD,flxkhdm,t3_frt9cf,1585584656.0,"CBD isolate itself is a white powder - CBD Isolate has been isolated down to just the CBD molecule. It has no other active ingredient and just aims to deliver therapeutic doses of CBD, isolated from the other cannabinoids and terpenes.  
This product allows you to easily consume large amounts of CBD - potentially helps conditions such as anxiety, pain, inflammation, diabetes, depression and more.  You can take it sublingually, put it in foods, smoothies, make your own products.. etc.  
The isolate I am familiar with is obtained from hemp or industrial hemp, but I believe you can probably extract it from high-THC cannabis plants as well? (don't quote me on that).  


I know a lot of folks you cannot use full spectrum products because it keeps them up - or makes them anxious feeling.. etc.  Not everyone can comfortable use full spectrum products.

Full Spectrum means there are several cannabinoids including THC.  So I would not recommend that for you.  However this company does offer a pure CBD only oil.  They also offer pure CBD isolate - which is exactly that.  just isolate.  you could put it in smoothies - make your own oils or just take it sublingually.  They have lab tests posted as well on all their products.  They are also having a sale right now - so it might be a good app to try something for yourself.  I don't have any experience with vaping, but they also have a vape juice in their shop too.

HealthAnxiety,fiqvx32,t3_f9bp3a,1582652624.0,"Hello,  
In my experience, the panic attack itself can last 1/2 an hour to 1 hour.    
But I've always felt anxiety before the actual attack - and anxiety/depression/extreme fatigue for sometimes days afterwards (depending on severity of attack).  
My attacks have been brought down considerably with change of diet: no gluten, no refined sugar, cut back on alcohol consumption by 80% (still have a drink here and there) - exercise - and supplements like ashwaghanda (brand: Organic India)and cbd (brand: Fully Activated CBD).  Actually, when I am in mid attack (or sometimes right before if I can think clearly) I take a full eyedropper of 1200mg CBD oil.  I truly feel it usually cuts the attack time in half.

Not sure how long a 600mg will last.  I use 1200mg daily and it all depends on how I am doing [mentally].  If I am having a rough go at life it might last 2-3 months.  If things are on the smoother side... at least 6 months.

I have generalized anxiety as well as depression.  My experiences definitely have triggers - brought on when I maybe haven't been sleeping well or have heavy work loads or going through Moon cycle.  
Typically, if I am having a full blown attack or even if its a couple days of anxiousness, I try to stay away from people.  I dont want to talk to anyone, for fear of brining on more anxiety and awkwardness.  When I am around my partner, it tends to be terrible.  I want nothing more than for him to just hold me - speak gently to me - make me popcorn or something... but I typically ride out like I am tough and have a massive suit of heavy armor on.  I also have severe difficulty communicating when experiencing anxiety and/or depression.  
We have had a rocky relationship because of this.  He wants me to tell him as soon as it comes up, but its extremely hard.  Its a pattern Ive been living since I was at least 14 (I am 38 now).  
I have changed my diet in the last ten years.  No refined sugar (makes it wayyyyy worse).  Btw, if she loves sweets - try Lily's Chocolate (stevia sweetened) or Honey Mama's (honey sweetened).  Also no gluten and have definitely noticed that if I do not exercise on a regular basis I get down in a deep anxiety hole.  Also started taking CBD oil about 3 or 4 years ago - I suggest Fully Activated.  Theyve been the most reliable and doesnt burn a massive hole in my bank account. (I refuse pharmaceuticals)  
.  
Idk if any of this is relatable.  I wish I could speak more freely to my boyfriend when Im feeling terrible.  He isn't super great at having 'softer energy', so all of this has been hard to navigate.  It usually ends up with him asking me if im alright for three days in a row then it becoming a huge blow up with me in tears FINALLY explaining my thoughts and worries and feelings and him asking why I didnt just tell him."
CBD,fi12giv,t3_f5j433,1582049303.0,"As someone who is into lifting/workout lifestyle - I am cautious as to what I ingest.  Especially sugar.  
Have you tried CBD Oil?  Or a CBD topical?  I have used Fully Activated for the past 3 or 4 years and love them.  I take 1200mg FS but they also offer a CBD only.  
Both my parents swear by their salve - my dad uses it on his neck and shoulders as well as forehead - to relieve headaches and pain due to breaking his neck several years ago (has permanent rods in his neck).  
My mom uses the salves for arthritis and pain from varicose veins in her legs.  


also - another thought - you could make your own oil.  That company also sells CBD isolate.  Then you could set your dose and save money by making it yourself."
CBD,fi11s14,t3_f5snxu,1582048934.0,"Hi - both my mom and dad use Fully Activated's Salve for their issues.  


My dad had an awful accident about 10yrs ago where he broke his neck.  The permanent rods in his shoulder and neck give him almost a constant migraine - as well as pain and low movement in neck and shoulders.  He says their salve is the only things that has ever helped him.  
My mom has some arthritis as well as vericose veins.  also says the salve takes away pain within a matter of minutes.    


Maybe if your mom is worried about taking an oil during the day she could try this topical?"

CBD,fhxtrep,t3_f59x8r,1581962111.0,"I have had CBD tea - though my personal opinion is that taking a few drops of oil is easier/quicker/feels more effective.  
I've put CBD distillate in my coffee and tea, but it doesn't really dissolve well.  For the past couple years I've used Fully Activated 1200mg Oil and feel like its the best for my money."
CBD,fhxsd58,t3_f5bz2s,1581961260.0,"Hi there,  


I have dealt with severe anxiety and depression since in my teens.  I have never taken pharmaceuticals and have only recently been managing these issues with diet, exercise and CBD (recently as in the last 5-7years).  
I have tried several brands - all over the place here in Colorado - but have had best results with Fully Activated 1200mg Full Spectrum Oil.  Daily use I take a 1/4 of an eye dropper which is about 10mg.  A day that I am having a more difficult day of anxiety, a 1/2 an eye dropper - which is about 20mg.  And when I am having a full blown panic attack (complete with hyperventilating) I take a full eye dropper - which is 40mg.  
The days that are overwhelming and I need to take the larger doses, I feel a shift in mood as well as slower hear rate - slower breathing in about 15-20min.  


Hope that helps - always open to discussing this more."
HealthAnxiety,fhmf1bq,t3_f3wrov,1581711935.0,"Definitely.  
Thankfully, it's not as often as it used to be.  I've changed my diet (no refined sugar or gluten) and have a daily exercise, vitamin and CBD regimen.  
On those days that I just feel off and distant, I take extra CBD oil.  Doesnt necessarily make me ""happy"" but evens my vibe out and prevents panic attacks."
CBD,fhisqp1,t3_f3eldj,1581631076.0,"Totally agree with this.  Used to be constantly smoking weed until a few years ago when I started to get horrible panic attacks from it.  
Love CBD flower in combo with CBD oil - especially when I am having a high-anxiety day."

CBDOilReviews,fhbimpo,t3_f1gj2u,1581443049.0,"Hi,  
I just commented on another post about 'fav CBD brand/product'  - I use a 1200mg full spectrum oil from fully activated cbd for anxiety (generalized as well as infrequent panic attacks).  If just for social or a day where im feeling mild anxiety, I take a 1/4 of an eyedropper.  In cases where im having a full blown attack, i take almost a full dropper and am calmed down in about 15-20min (depending on how bad the attack is).  I think its around $80 - I usually end up finding some coupon codes to use as well.  


Also - just a thought - you could make your own oil blend.  That company also sells isolate.  Ive often thought of doing this, just too lazy."
CBDOilReviews,fhbhs1r,t3_evf51b,1581442559.0,"I've tried maybe 6 or 7 different CBD companies over the last few years but I keep coming back to Fully Activated CBD.  I use the 1200mg full spectrum oil for anxiety and insomnia issues.  Very mild taste - almost flavorless.  Doesn't break my wallet.  Most of all.  WORKS.    
I can clearly remember every time I have had a panic attack in the last three years - in severe moments like that I take almost a full eye dropper.  Within 15-20mins I am breathing normally and my heart is no longer racing.  
Both my parents now use them for personal reasons.  My Dad swears by their salve.  He broke his neck about 10yrs ago and because of the rods in his shoulder and neck, has a constant headache.  He says the salve is the only thing that takes the pain away.    
That in itself, is gold."
CBD,fgpzx86,t3_ezsucc,1581015223.0,"Hi there,  
I am not knowledgeable on your situation.  However, I have been buying from Fully Activated CBD since 2015.  I personally, take their 1200mg Oil but I seem to remember them having a 5000mg oil available.  
Tried around 6 or 7 different brands.  Always come back to them.  Works and doesn't make me broke.  
I think they also carry pure cbd isolate - then you could make whatever strength you need?"
