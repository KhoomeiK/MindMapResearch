BlackHair,fee75rb,t3_eopetz,1579027793.0,"Deep condition!!!!!!!  Moisturize your hair with LOC method (Liquid, Oil, cream). I would do it every other day. Shampoo less and co wash ( washing hair with condition) more. Before you shampoo your hair do a hot oil treatment ( you sit with warm oil on your hair for like 15 mins).  Honestly this is bare minimum but easy and will keep it coily and shiny. Rinse your hair with cold water it keeps your curls less frizzy for us 4C folks. Good luck handsome!!"

PandR,f7pajr0,t1_f7p8ivb,1573946392.0,That’s fair but honestly I like seeing healthy fun relationships. I just think that’s why Ben and Leslie was a nice pair to me. They really supported each other and that shit is not something you see a lot. I thought it was wonderful they were equally ambitious and Ben was never intimidated by Leslie and her accolades and that’s why to me they will always be better not that they weren’t ever going through any problems but they really liked each other and it was based on more than lust or anything else superficial. To me you can see how much they just really cared for each other but I totally get where you’re coming from. To each their own.
PandR,f7p2juw,t1_f7on05l,1573940505.0,Yes finally!! They both were equally annoying as fuck and definitely deserved each other.

I can understand you want her to be happy but she clearly isn’t happy dating so take the hint and mind you’re business and support her in a more positive way.

If you got married would you continue to allow this behavior? No. If he can’t see that and tells you she means more then let him have her and watch how all of a sudden it’ll blow up in his face. I had my ex bf cheat on me with a best friend right in my face and I had no idea but the texting and hanging out and the sentimental shit you described was the same. To the point that he chose her over me when we got into a fight that she started. I want you to avoid that pain because it’s not worth it AT ALL. Op it’s still early to get out and the more you stay the more he will gaslight you and make you feel like an idiot. Please leave him.
