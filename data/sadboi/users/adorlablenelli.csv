BlackHair,fee75rb,t3_eopetz,1579027793.0,"Deep condition!!!!!!!  Moisturize your hair with LOC method (Liquid, Oil, cream). I would do it every other day. Shampoo less and co wash ( washing hair with condition) more. Before you shampoo your hair do a hot oil treatment ( you sit with warm oil on your hair for like 15 mins).  Honestly this is bare minimum but easy and will keep it coily and shiny. Rinse your hair with cold water it keeps your curls less frizzy for us 4C folks. Good luck handsome!!"

To me you can see how much they just really cared for each other but I totally get where you‚Äôre coming from. To each their own.

I had my ex bf cheat on me with a best friend right in my face and I had no idea but the texting and hanging out and the sentimental shit you described was the same. To the point that he chose her over me when we got into a fight that she started. I want you to avoid that pain because it‚Äôs not worth it AT ALL.
