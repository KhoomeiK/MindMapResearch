depression,erz39w3,t1_erz036s,1561424525.0,"Depends, ADHD itself can cause those issues (I think they call it ""reactive"" anxiety/depression), and treating the ADHD in such a case should normally relieve them too. As for truly comorbid depression/anxiety, there is evidence for their effectiveness with depression (Vyvanse was nearly approved for major depression, but just fell short of FDA approval). As for anxiety, not so much, since stimulants often cause it and make it worse. However, there is evidence they can be effective, in particular social anxiety disorder.

I am trying to get help, but I find it near impossible to talk about my feelings or thoughts, it just seems like I don't have any anymore, and I always feel like focusing on helping myself is bad, that I should focus on everyone else. Last week I had to put a gun to my head just to get my feelings and thoughts out, after that I realized I seriously needed help, and I needed to take it seriously too. Thing is I can be manipulative in a way so I don't have to deal with anything, not even my own thoughts. I can't seem to deal with anything and act or think right, and I can't seem to change this. I sometimes wonder if I have a personality disorder. Anyway, I am trying to get help, your response has given me a little hope, though it won't last long for me. Since the gun thing last week I've been trying to write everything down for my therapist, my real thoughts, not just excuses or fake ones to hide my real ones, the past instances of abuse and neglect, etc. As terrible as it was to threaten my own life, it helped me realize all of this, especially the abuse and neglect.

I know this is a bit off topic, but I think it's good for me to get it out, my dad told me my mom may have been abused pretty badly when she was young. Her dad was a classic case of untreated ADHD with anger issues, though they never hid that part from me, however, my dad told me that there was more to it, that he physically and sexually abused my grandma, and possibly my mom.
