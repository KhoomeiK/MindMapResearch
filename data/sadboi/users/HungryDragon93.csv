introvert,fp35r0i,t3_gark9e,1588273561.0,I would say what bothers me the most is my trust issues along with worrying about getting close to people and they end up doing me dirty.  Being introverted and having social anxiety along with regular anxiety it's a real mess. I can't seem to open up to anyone i feel like i need to put on a front and it kills me. Because there could be a potential friendship or something like that that would result of being my true self. It's going to be a long journey. Most of it comes from where i grew up and trying to get past the past. I've had some losses and it's changed me.
