FemaleDatingStrategy,fqit8zq,t3_gj34ww,1589400576.0,"I’m a Muslim woman, it all depends on finding a man with the same halal/haram ratio as you. That’s going to mean different things for different people. There are certain characteristics that are haram, that I won’t see as a red flag, that another Muslim woman would. It’s all relative, so the stuff you look for and questions you ask would also change accordingly. 

Make sure you see eye to eye on what’s important to you. If you’re vehemently against alcohol, don’t date someone who drinks hoping you can change him. Similarly, if you’re someone that enjoys a drink or two socially...don’t marry a sheikh hoping he can inspire you to do better. That’s just asking for problems off the bat. Same goes for key lifestyle things like eating halal meat, fasting, praying, etc. Try to find an equal mind. 

Characteristics of Muslim HVM I know (some of these may be culture specific, and may not apply to someone more devout than me) that are specific to their Muslim background. All the other characteristics of a HVM we talk about in this sub still apply to Muslim people. 

1. Has no opinion on hijab. Whether a woman should wear it, shouldn’t wear it, whether his wife/daughter should wear it or when. They understand it’s the woman’s decision and between her and God at the end of the day. When you ask him “do you want a wife that wears a hijab one day” his answer should be that he doesn’t care what his wife chooses to do. 
2. Him and his family front all costs of the wedding
3. He has a home ready for me to move into with him that doesn’t require a financial investment from me (this is also big requirement of my parents, they’d never say yes to someone that needed my help to buy the house we are bout to live in) 
4. Educated. Being educated is such a big part of so many cultures where Islam is dominant that not having a bachelors degree after a certain age is a red flag. Especially if his family doesn’t care. 
5. Has had some time living away from his parents. Although this is rare with Muslim men, I can’t handle a man that goes straight from living with his brown immigrant mother that probably smothered him/spoiled him to living with me. 
6. In my opinion I see Muslim LVM more often being mammas boys or caring too much about pleasing the women in their family which can be problematic if there is ever a situation where it’s you versus them (this may just be my culture, but someone that abuses/neglects his mom is rare, more likely to come across men that need someone to help them cut that umbilical cord). A HVM respects the women in his family, and honors them in the way he interacts with other women, but creates healthy boundaries with them too. 
7. How is his relationship with his dad like - how important that is depends on who his dad is. How was his dad’s relationship like with the women in the house? What does he think about his fathers behavior, and what does he do about it if he is a LVM? 
8. Doesn’t believe in using physical discipline/casual child abuse to discipline children. 
9. Is in touch with his religion and culture of his nation of origin, but doesn’t let it rule his entire life. I want to be with an individual. Not Generic Muslim Man #738281. 
10. Ask if they dated in the past and if they dated non Muslim women and what their intentions were. HVM didn’t date much in the past because they were focused on their studies/business, the few women they did date they dated because they had an emotional connection and wanted to be together regardless of faith. LVM will straight up brag about all the non Muslim women they lead on but will never marry “because they want to settle down with a good girl” like you. 
11. Non judgemental about where you are with your faith
12. Doesn’t ask any questions about your sexual history. Doesn’t divulge information unsolicited. 
13. Budgets life without expectation that you are financially contributing to anything, considers his money as his and your money, and your money as your money. 
14. HVM do not care if they have males or females as children. They want healthy children. LVM will volunteer that they hope they never have a girl. 
15. Consistent with his deen, whatever that might mean. Someone who goes from sharmoot party boy one day to sheikh the next day has things to figure out on his own, you can’t bring peace to that confusion."

I’m in no rush to put my career on hold to spread some man’s seed lmao. 

This person is a LVM so of course he doesn’t get it. He is seeing it under the lense of finding a man being the ultimate prize by any means necessary. 

The men in my life willingly put up with this shit. Even if they leave or get frustrated they always come back. I don’t seek them out or initiate contact with them, they seek me out and chase me. They are fully capable of leaving me alone if they want to. My career and money is for me, not a man. A man seeing my money as a bonus is actually a red flag, I’m not a ladder to his upgrade. LVM are just mad when they see a woman doing better for herself than they could ever do for her.

Things I ask to figure it out:

1. Are you a drinker? How often do you drink? 
2. What do you usually drink when you drink? 
3. Is it social for you or do you find yourself drinking alone sometimes to unwind? 
4. Have you ever had a DUI/DWI? 
5. How long have you gone without any alcohol since you started drinking? 
   (People who say they don’t know because they drink every few days and have done so since they were a teenager are a red flag to me at the age I’m at now) 

6. Does your family drink too? Is it a big part of family time/holidays? (This helps uncover possible family history of alcoholisms. Some people will flat out say oh yeah my dad was an alcoholic etc, or no my family is against alcohol, which can give you an idea as to his risk factors)."

Making a man jealous 101 is laughing at any other man’s jokes around him even if they aren’t funny. Yes, men like the rest of us can feel one way or another regarding humor or when humor is involved. These feelings aren’t exclusive to men and they don’t automatically make someone low value. How they respond to it is, so I wouldn’t be so quick to write humor off as a weapon. It’s a tool. 

I don’t really agree with this post because it kind of paints humor, either having it or seeking it out, to be a negative quality because of how it could be a coping mechanism. What’s wrong with that though? Out of all the negative coping mechanisms out there are we really drawing the line at goofy dudes? Everything we do in life is a coping mechanism. Literally everything we do is just a way to waste time until our time is up.  I don’t see this as a red flag at all. The type of jokes someone cracks, and the timing, says more about them than the fact that they like to use humor. If all his jokes are sexist or degrading then that is a red flag. Someone with a genuinely good sense of humor with great timing, that’s all green to me baby 

Not everyone who endured trauma or mental illness is inherently low value or toxic either. Someone could have developed a sense of humor because humor was the only thing they had during a dark time in their life. Healing doesn’t automatically make someone lose that sense of humor. There are a lot more blaring red flags regarding undiagnosed mental illness than being funny 

I cannot date a guy who does not share my sense of humor. Humor is important to me, I seek it out and I create it. Comedy is a big part of my life and my family’s life. I’ve tried dating guys with different senses of humor and it was boring.

You are a sales person, and you are the product you are selling to your boss and coworkers and clients every time you interact with them. Your representative needs to be dealing with people at work, not you. 

In regards to gossip, you cannot stop it from happening.

At the end of the day, the only thing you can control is you. In a situation where gossip does arise, don’t entertain it or feed into it. If a situation at work becomes unbearable where multiple people are disrespecting you like that - don’t wait until your boss decides you’re “bad for morale.” Quit. Always be ready to leave if you’re being mistreated. Not just with men but with work too. Do not be afraid to quit.

FemaleDatingStrategy,fotiwff,t3_g9hm9y,1588055309.0,"What’s your ethnic background? I’m just asking because I live through the same thing. I’m in my late 20s and had that same mindset for awhile that I was going to “expire” at 25 too. Mostly from having my family push it into my head that I had to be married by then. 

A lot of that is what you said, cultural and misogynistic. Some people may disagree with me, but at this point I’ve stopped arguing with older female family members that have that mindset. At least not directly, I try to change their minds in a more indirect way. 

Communication is key but comprehension more so. It’ll help to get them to comprehend what you’re saying first by demonstrating it to them. 

For my family they finally eased up on me due to a couple reasons: 

1. I took good care of myself, I don’t look any different than I did back then. The wall is a myth. I’m the oldest of my siblings but get mistaken for the youngest all the time. I think now that they’ve seen me age they’re not afraid of me aging anymore. 
2. They’re proud of my academic and career accomplishments. They’re glad I invested the time to build that for myself before getting married. They understand I still want to grow in my career and the longer I wait to get married, the better partner I’ll be and the better partner I’ll attract. 
3. They know there hasn’t been anybody worth my hand in marriage yet, to my standards or their standards 

I let my family vet men and bring them to my attention. It’s normal in my culture, and it’s how those women in my family got married at young ages. If my mom, for example, comes across an eligible bachelor that she thinks is worth my time she will talk to his mom to talk to him, and then talk to me about it. If I’m interested and he is interested, then she gives them my contact information and he reaches out to me. The men I meet through family never behave out of pocket, because they don’t want to dishonor their families, and I know they’re at least for sure what they say they are (in regards to financial or career position, etc). 

Even with that I haven’t met somebody. Since I let my family play a role in my dating life in that way, they see for themselves that I’m single because I’m not willing to settle. That makes them comfortable, so they haven’t pressured me or made comments about my age in 2 years. They know for themselves there isn’t shit out there to be in a rush down the aisle for. 

Maybe when you talk to your family about their misogynistic views on age and women, try to reframe it by explaining that you want to take care of yourself first and make sure you aren’t settling. If you’re from a culture where parents acting as your wing man is a thing too, let them do that for you and see what they come up with. It’ll make them feel good to feel involved in some way, and ease their anxieties a little. Part of the pressure they put on us is a projection of anxieties they were fed their whole lives about not ending up alone. If you can show your family that you are truly better off alone than with a man that is bad for you, it’ll smooth that fear a bit. A lot of people know that but don’t truly understand it, especially if they went straight from their dads house to their husbands house and never had to be alone. That’ll make it easier to have a real discussion about the underlying problems as they’d be mentally more receptive to a discussion at that point once they comprehend your side better."

That’s kind of what I mean, I feel like I’m still low maintenance because my routines outside of skin care don’t take long but I look high maintenance. My makeup routine takes 15 minutes because I paid attention to what I felt like I was “correcting” with makeup and then tried to find a time saving fix so that I only “need” a little to enhance my look. 

There are some nice eye shadows by this one brand you can literally apply with a finger, and they look cute. 

I use those for everyday with eyeliner, and then just a little bit of concealer and a lip tint. I got my lashes lifted so I don’t really need mascara and I got my brows microbladed. Those things saved me a lot of time, that and clearing my skin up. 

When it comes to your hair, you don’t have to straighten it for it to look good. Work with your natural curl or wave. I never ever straighten my hair or blow dry it unless the hair stylist does it at the end of a session. If you have natural texture to your hair, nourish your hair so you can wear it naturally. 

Then when it comes to clothes just buy things you feel good in, that fit you right, and look like quality materials. That’s all you really need for an effective glow up that won’t take you a lot to maintain day to day."

As soon as they elevate themselves though those are the kind of women they start to chase. Men love gold diggers, they just can’t afford them. 

I changed my style. I was super low maintenance in how I dressed and realized I just felt better about myself when I was dressed up and looking my best.

As an adult, looking at those pictures now...I looked like a fucking child. My ""developed body"" at that age actually did not stop developing for several years afterwards, I looked like a teenager moving through puberty - not a grown woman. No logical person would have looked at me back then and assumed any age that wasnt below 18. 

Don't believe him - even if true HVM have reason to feel confused, they ask & confirm. I only date men around my age or at most 5 years older, but I can pass for a woman a decade my junior and frequently do (I am late 20s). I have had to go as far as to pull out a drivers license card before to confirm my age.

he will pop up for sure its just a matter of when, spend this time working on yourself so he regrets it when he does. The best way to make progress towards yourself, is to convince yourself that its over and you are never going back. At that point you will start to imagine a future without him, which will lead you to want to improve yourself so you can have a better future than what you could have had with him. At that point he will feel regret. he will feel no regret if he feels like you still feel like you lost out on something high value or the best relationship you ever had. 

also sometimes its hard to admit that even though it was your best relationship so far that it was still with a LVM. The ex I am referring to here wasnt a NVM or ZVM, he added a lot of value to my life or else I wouldn't have stayed - it just wasn't in the right ways or all the way to make him a true HVM. So accept that too to help you move on, that even if it didn't work out and he was not a HVM at least that LVM helped you elevate your standards for relationships a bit. With FDS you can finish that process and get something better than you could have ever imagined with him with a real HVM."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fo8jbok,t3_g6b9ed,1587597670.0,"I have dated men who were self aware enough to admit they have a problem, and man enough to seek out help...

...and men who probably needed to be medicated but were convinced they were neurotypical.

I'd choose the self aware man over the other man every time.

In my opinion, I feel like even if you aren't mentally ill everyone could benefit from therapy. If you are a human being with a childhood and human relationships and a past, no matter how great you think all those things are, you could still benefit from therapy.

Behind every diagnosed, medicated man doing something about his mental health is literally thousands of other men projecting their undiagnosed mental illness on the women they convinced the world are crazy.

I have borderline personality disorder which if you know of it, is one of those mental health disorders that people don't think is worth being understanding for. Meaning, people are very supportive of mental health when your mental health illness symptoms are ""acceptable"" (people are ok with you being sad, or worried). But god forbid you exhibit any of the several other symptoms that are common with other mental illness beyond anxiety or depression - suddenly you are a toxic bitch with the worst intentions that requires immediate cancellation.

This can cause a pretty lonely existence for some people. If you search BPD, you will find a lot of content from jaded ex lovers from people with undiagnosed or untreated BPD saying how we are all a lost cause. That isn't necessarily true or fair, its a sweeping generalization that everyone that has ever had this one diagnoses is doomed to the same fate. That takes away control from the sick person, basically telling them because you are sick you are unlovable and a waste of effort. In the case of BPD, you end up starved of the one thing you crave or feel like you need the most - meaningful human connections. Which then make your symptoms flare up worse, which makes people hate you more, etc etc.

That isn't helpful for people to mental illness, it only fuels feelings of isolation that then fuel suicidal idealizations.

In my case, I have been in remission for awhile and feel like I no longer meet the criteria at all since I no longer experience the minimum of 5/9 symptoms. I am a high value woman in every regard. I am smart, successful academically and professionally, I out earn the average American family with just my main source of income alone, I am conventionally attractive, I am cultured, and I a have a vibrant personality. I am also technically mentally ill, and at a point severely so. I was not a high value woman when I was not diagnosed. I was not a high value woman when I got a diagnosis but did not pursue treatment.

I put in the work to become a more high value woman, in order to attract a true high value man, by seeking real help for my problems and sticking to it.

My whole point is in my situation, a man taking anti depressants is not a red flag alone. It would be hypocritical of me to say that a HVM to me would have never suffered or conquered a mental health issue. However, I think its fair if you are neurotypical to set that standard for yourself. Although I do think someone actively working on their issues and acknowledging them is not a red flag on its own, its also not your burden to bear if you don't already have these issues. It is a challenge, and you don't know how far they are in their healing process. You don't have to give them a chance if you feel uncomfortable with their situation, or if you feel like in doing so you are giving someone the benefit of the doubt. The most dangerous thing you can give a man, is the benefit of the doubt. So trust your gut. Maybe something inside you pushed you to make this post because you know for you, dealing with these issues is not something you want for your life. I think that is okay."
