stripper,fpa02ft,t1_fp9efcx,1588438093.0,Stripping has saved me multiple times. Before this relationship I was in another abusive relationship 3 years ago and I secretly saved money behind his back in my makeup palettes. He knew I was a stripper and he was okay with it as long as I gave him my money. So I would lie and say I only made half of what I really did and I saved the other half in my makeup palettes because I knew he would never go through those. It made me sick giving him my money but I did what I had to to leave.. of course I’m in yet another abusive relationship and have to get out. He said this morning I’m living on my own from now on so I definitely have to strip because he was paying my rent and my vanilla job was enough. I feel like in live in hell..
