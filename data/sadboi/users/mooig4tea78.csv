Yeah exactly. I feel like that kind of humour is kinda old now but yeah (it iz what it iz). At least they arent like those 'Instagram comedians'.

I'm more of a twitter/tiktok humour kinda person. Its more up-to-date in my opinion. I think tiktok is a big inside-joke and people who dont have it dont know what its truly like. There are TiKtOk DanCEs that are known to be hated but after you're there for a while, you realise why it's actually really popular.
