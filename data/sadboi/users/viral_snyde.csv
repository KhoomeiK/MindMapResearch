When I went to tell his girlfriend, I was made out to be the one who made him cheat. Even though he used a knife to coerce me and violated me, leaving me in tears. I had to move on with that narrative because she wouldnt believe me. She thought she knew him after dating him for 7 years.

I would also say it Lelouch often does things that dont particularly benefit his main goal. Despite he and Angelo being driven by revenge, Angelo's plan is a bit more streamlined, even as it gets more and more complicated as it adapts to the larger picture. There is also the supernatural aspect which makes it appear Lelouch and Light have a advantage. But Light is basically found out immediately. Even with a magic book that kills with a name, he makes far more mistakes and the buffer of him not having to commit the crime in person is the only reason the show has opportunity to proceed."

The lack of supernatural elements makes the whole thing that much more impressive because it rarely if ever feels like the MC just got lucky. Especially as things heat up towards the second half, you really do wonder what the next part of the plan is and how he plots to manipulate the situation and everyone around him to fulfil his goal.

The ending, also, is way more emotional than Death Note's and the show can really hit the emotions of the viewer, leaving them both conflicted about the happenings but also excited for how they play out. Nothing in Code Geass ever gave me a thrill like 91 Days. And neither show left me so hollow and yet so satisfied."
mentalhealth,fqv35zo,t1_fqv2e0o,1589668939.0,"The idea that a pet helps mental illness is in relation to children and adults who grew up with pets. It does not really translate to adults already with severe mental illness who have never had that responsibility. The reason why animals can help with mental illness is exactly what I said before. It gets people out of their own head. They are not solely focused on themselves, they put their effort and their reason for living into the context of their pet. The reason why I stopped trying to commit suicide was because I got a cat. Because my mindset was, if i die, who will love and care for my cat like i do? I grew up with cats, dogs, fish, birds, goats, horses, chickens, rabbits, Guinea pigs and hamsters. So I already had that foundation with animals and learnt what it meant to take care of them from a young age.

If you read that as I didnt think you were taking care of the dog, that is not what I meant. Animals are perceptive to the uneasiness of their owners and it can cause issues over a prolonged period of time. Especially when the dog recognizes that you become that way only in its presence. If you cant handle the idea that you need to be alive to care for this animal, and that isnt a good enough reason to stick around, having a dog isnt going to magically fix that."

I actually read the manga far ahead of the anime and got to the mystery reveal and found it uninspiring and taking the whole premise of the story I had been following up to that point and making it something else without really giving the original story a satisfying ending. I wasnt satisfied by it and anyone has the right to say a show did not meet expectation. The anime follows the manga so closely and anything left out isnt going to be ground breaking for the story that is taking place.

If you think those spoilers change the fact that the story overall wasnt that good and suddenly it magically gets so much better, you are completely mistaken. It was fun, but does nothing to fix the poor characters and the convoluted mystery. There are far better anime out there. It's a fun little romp, dont think too much while watching it. The show spells everything out eventually because the twists that are introduced are so out to left field that they need to be thoroughly explained for the audience to be on board.

The author is not the best creator, nor the best writer. I'm sorry I paid more attention to that than you. But dont go denouncing someone else's opinion just because you cant see the forest for the trees. When Levi gets an injury at the start of the series, basically a twisted ankle, he is out of action for a relatively long time, in a realistic manner. Mikasa gets her RIBS BROKEN and is chopping wood and walking around like she was merely poked in the side. Yeah, there isnt terrible characterization at all. Obvious plot armour for the main cast.

Add to it Isayama's one statement about his characters was that he was worried they were too perfect. Eren literally gets his ass kicked and/or kidnapped every episode all the way until the Historia arc and Mikasa as a character never grows. Armin is the only decently written character of the hero group and even then, he gets the short end of the stick until the Beast Titan arc.

If you like the story, that is subjective. I personally find it too cluttered and that it has become unimaginative as it has progressed. The aspect of the Titans is removed and that was what the show was named for. It isnt fun anymore. And a shitty main character doesnt a good anime make. The fact that you praise it so thoughtlessly kinda says all I need to say on the matter. You can like it all you like, but it is not an anime anyone needs to see aside for the animation.

{Sing Yesterday for Me}

{Say ""I love You""}

{My Little Monster}

{Wagnaria!!}

Given is an amazingly realistic BL series where the relationship and feelings are allowed to take time. It's a beautiful anime and everyone I k kw who has watched it has cried at some point during it because of just how well the emotions are expressed.

Sing Yesterday for Me is an extremely grounded slice of life save for the main guy character being the classic failure of an adult, yet he has women fighting over him for some reason. But the characters as individuals are extremely human and it does take it's time. It is also ongoing, so you have a new episode to look forward to every week.

Say I Love You is a decent anime. Pretty solid in the stance for realism. Personally would prefer a less swishy washy character as, when the series gets more dramatic towards the end, the main character just sort of goes back and forth between committing to the relationship or not. But I suppose that is realistic. A lot of people constantly second guess their relationships and, with the main character's backstory, it is believable more or less for her to be so quick to pull away. It does definitely feel like character growth. From the first episode to the (second to) last, I truly feel like the main character grows. But seriously, fuck the last episode. It would have been great if only I never saw the last episode.

My Little Monster is a slow building anime of a pretty hardened girl and a loose carefree guy who has a bad reputation. About halfway through the conflict if the relationship feels like the writer was just forcing it on when they could have connected long before. Just to keep the story going for no other reason than they didnt want it over yet. So there isnt a very satisfying ending, but it is a cute romantic comedy that I still am very fond of.

Wagnaria or Working!! Is a comedy series based off 4 panel comics. Like One Punch Man or Axis Powers Hetalia, but the show did an amazing job of using these short comics to make a coherent story. There are several couples throughout and it made me cry, twice, watching it. It does have some wonky aspects not firmly grounded in reality, like an androphobic girl who can literally punch through walls. But if you dont mind the anime comedy aspect, the romances are the SLOWEST of slow burns (one romance took nearly all 3 seasons to bloom) and it focuses heavily on the relationships between characters. Again, comedy first, romance second, but when it gets serious, it doesnt pull any punches."

Basically have a full scene of 2 MCs monologuing over human nature and why it's terrible and that war and prejudices dont change and that chances are no one can fix it, only to then finish it off as ""The fighting stops when someone wins"" like, lol wut? You just had this whole profound scene of how terrible humans are and the futility of it all, but instead of being like ""Fighting for something is still better than wallowing in it, having hope that things can change"" it goes down the route of ""If you win, everything goes your way"". And the entire second season was garbage.

Another anime that makes me mad is Soul Eater. Spectacular anime throughout until you get towards the end. Especially the last 3 episodes. The anime completely diverges from the manga for the ending and it shows. And can I just say, you have the main character solo-fighting the big bad because everyone else of the hero squad is down for the count, have the MC show a whole new power that has never been hinted at or alluded to throughout the show, have that power literally do nothing, and what kills the main villain is a regular old punch to the face with the power of friendship.

This show I watched more recently and actually enjoyed until the last episode, but that is Say ""I love You"". Slice of life romance, not very heavy in the comedy. MC has some issues throughout but still manages to maintain a likeable status until the very last episode. Where I just hate everything. The whole tone of the episode changes, the MC has redundant character arcs through the span of 1 episode, the fact that a main character pictured to be capable whole also allowing her heart to soften through the course of the series turns into a spineless slug where she can't even ring the doorbell of the dude she's been dating for, like, a year.

Animesuggest,fqkyqvs,t3_giwrae,1589440380.0,"Fruits Basket.

The stories are quite heart wrenching for the characters but also interspersed with comedy and light hearted scenes throughout. I personally think it is harder to get emotional over a show that is consistently depressing than it is to empathize with characters who have bought of depression but still carry on."
cats,fqhcqn5,t1_fqh6x19,1589374133.0,"I have a siamese but her eyes are a pale blue. Kinda like a husky's. I thought she was a ragdoll from how much fur she had, but she's even more long haired than your baby. Kinda like a walking carpet."

depression,fqh4vgv,t1_fqh4hqn,1589367859.0,"I'm glad you're getting help.

The only thing I can say is that a relationship is a part of your life, not the end of your life. So even if it doesnt work out, it isnt the end of the world. I get being codependent. I was codependent to my abusive mother for years, but that isnt who you are either. It isnt something to just accept. It will only cause trouble for you and those around you. So again, I'm glad you're getting help.

But the idea that you want to die over a relationship needs to stop. Because that places unfair pressure on your partner. Just cold turkey, you need to cut that thought process out. If you do love her, you wouldnt do that to her."
cats,fqh4lw8,t3_giwq8l,1589367614.0,"Just pet your cats. The feeling of petting gives them the same comfort as if they were being groomed by another cat. That's why you often have cats lick you back while you pet them.

Humans have different bacteria in their mouths and introducing that to your pet can get them sick. It is actually worse to be bitten by a human than a dog."
depression,fqh4buo,t3_giwpom,1589367351.0,"Frankly, are you mature enough to be in a relationship? It isnt fair to put that responsibility of a significant other. It isnt right to hold them hostage with your feelings. You cannot be so dependent on another person that you would die if they were suddenly not there. A relationship needs to allow space for people to change and grow, by being so overly reliant on the other person, you smother them. You add to their stress and depression because they feel like everything they do has to make you happy or you'll fly over the edge. That isnt right.

I get you're depressed, maybe even she's depressed. Does that make it okay for you to throw your issues on her to carry. You're asking her to carry you. What about her. When does she get to live her own life?"
cats,fqh3dgr,t1_fqh2wn4,1589366421.0,"The adults and the ones who are unable to be socialized I have accepted that is where they want to be. But for the social ones and the ones who can be rescued, it's hard to walk past them. They have everything right except a home. And because they were born knowing us, they trust humans more than they should for outside cats. I told my mom when she started that she was going to make us all regret this. She's put these cats in a situation where they rely on us now, and she's not taking any initiative to capture these cats to get them fixed. I have to do everything.

I need her to do something to make this stop before it gets worse. What will she do in 4 months when her colony of 7 turns into a colony of 20 because she didnt do anything now. Ultimately, taking the kittens now would be the best case scenario for us as it reduces the number of cats to get fixed later on, as well as things the colony. If I could even find a home for 1 or 2 it would be better than leaving them all there.

At least that's what I tell myself."
OriginalCharacters,fpqm6be,t3_gezu3d,1588826103.0,"And yes, this is my art. Character and image belong to me.

This character is an OC for a DRRR fanfiction I didnt put too much effort into when I made her. She was more or less a plot device. However I realized, 3 years later, she would be the best character to help move my story along after all this time, which required me to put more thought into her. I actually never described her past her brown hair being curly in nature, so I had no image of who this person was and that was getting in the way of starting to write again. So one evening at 3 am i suddenly had an image of her in my head and had to put it on paper. So one day later with some digital magic, here she is.

And I am very aware she doesnt have a chest. There's a reason for that."

deadbydaylight,fpce2ak,t1_fp7hd1j,1588497055.0,"The fact that there are 2-3 hooks nearby at any point kinda speaks for itself. It didnt used to be this way.

Add to it that the hit boxes around windows and pallets have been increased, reducing the efficiency of these obstacles and making them more or less pointless (use them more as shortcuts as you are definitely going to get hit around them) and that the devs have completely removed numerous pallets and windows, destroying loops. Your best bet as survivor is to just not be seen."
deadbydaylight,fp4bdhs,t1_fp49pdx,1588295474.0,"They're changing the courses. Putting more hooks, moving totem spawn points to make them more difficult. Removing loops making levels smaller. It basically guarantees you are near a survivor at all times in some levels."

To be honest, I dont have an.answer. but im still here."

mentalhealth,fotqxj1,t3_g9jeq6,1588062963.0,"Everyone is a hypocrit.

You do it because you care about others. It's normal. I'm here planning how to kill myself in 5 different ways while telling you that your lack of love for yourself doesnt make you a bad person for helping others. It doesnt matter that you cant help you. It's normal, because there's an innate resentment towards ourselves. We see the worst sides of who we are constantly. But how could it ever be wrong to take your love and hand it out? To take the tenderness you cant bring to yourself and reach out to others who feel the same? They have no love for themselves either.

How is that wrong? You're not expected to be a hero. You're just a kid. Why should you be better than everyone else? You're just a human, and you're struggling too.

How is it wrong?"
thesims,fotqkma,t3_g9jbva,1588062594.0,"I have a preference for alpha personally. Her features translate better to the realistic style. I know people say they look creepy but I genuinely think that your talent in realistic facial proportions is better suited for it. You could easily exaggerate to stylized the Maxis match, but the way she is in those pictures, she's suited best to alpha."
mentalhealth,fotq8kq,t3_g9j6av,1588062260.0,"Take a step back.

You can love people too much, where you smother them and they will resent you for it. It doesnt matter if you are right or not. Doesnt matter your intentions. Normal people dont devour people like we do.

I have a very similar past to you, with a very similar situation at home. But the one thing I realized that has saved all my relationships is to hold back and not care so deeply. No, the relationships are not fulfilling, they will never fill the void you have missing from never knowing the stability of a loving parent. But if you want to keep people, the best I can offer is hold them at a distance."
mentalhealth,fokn0i9,t1_foiq6xu,1587845119.0,"The worst thing you could ever do is send someone to a mental facility. I have been intentionally overdosed on medication in hospitals despite not being a problem patient, which damaged what self esteem I had as I could still think like a person but was unable to communicate effectively and felt completely vulnerable to the whims of doctors and other patients. I was told by nursing staff that I was being punished for trying to kill myself and the more distraught I was the worse I would be treated. I was screamed at in my face for not finishing meals because I was so doped up that I could barely stay awake. Let alone have an appetite.

Dont ever send someone to a mental facility unless you want them to hate you."

mentalhealth,fo5m5ao,t1_fo5lxwg,1587529111.0,That's how I feel too. I dont understand it myself. But it is a feeling that I have had for a very long time. I just dont feel like I make a difference alive or dead. Like I am already dead in a sense. And the fact that i physically am not bothers me. It's a frustration more than anything else.
mentalhealth,fo5l4qu,t1_fo5kran,1587528348.0,"I mean. I just dont have an attachment to being alive is the best way to put it. I dont care that I'm alive but I get so envious of death around me. I was suicidal for a long time and dealt with childhood abuse up until the age of 22. Things are better now and I'm fine. I ho to therapy, take my medication. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but my medication has it under control for the most part.

I'm just not too keen on being alive. I just got informed my brother has a high possibility of being COVID positive and aside from the concern of the money involved, I'm actually quite excited. I mean, what if I get sick? Hopefully no one else does. Hopefully it can just be me and I can die from it.

I just don't think I should be alive. It just feels wrong."
