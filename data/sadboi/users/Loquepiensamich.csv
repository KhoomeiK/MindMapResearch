Makeup101,eyr1ju7,t3_cy52zh,1567358942.0,"I wouldn't use foundation, your skin is probably fine, and if you can't commit to taking it off every night (let's be honest I can't even do that), you're probably are going to end with worse skin. 
I would start with eyeshadow (Wich for me it's the fun part ! ) and some lipstick, maybe some light blush (this is probably the mistake I see the most in people who are starting)
Oh ! And remember that lights can definitely change the look. Like, maybe in your bathroom your foundation looks good, but on natural light you can see all the mistakes !
But anyway, congratulations to you ! Make up is here to make us feel more comfortable with our faces, not to hide what you don't like necessarily. Have fun !!!"
