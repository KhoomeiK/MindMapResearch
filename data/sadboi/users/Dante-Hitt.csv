spirituality,fpbaurg,t1_fpbaiap,1588465851.0,"So, that sounds a little like ‚Äúapathy‚Äù which is basically not feeling like doing much, not inspired, little energy.

Or maybe boredom which similar.

One big thing that can help you FEEL more grounded, focused and empowered is honing in on WHEN you‚Äôre meditating - if you meditate first thing when you wake up, that‚Äôs going to be dramatically more helpful than later in the day

Why?

Most people check their phone first thing when they wake up and start reacting to their thoughts, which are usually negative or repetitive, and their energy spirals downward.

Then they start building excuse making momentum and negative momentum vs. empowered and intentional momentum.

spirituality,flfhw4d,t1_flf2b7g,1585106995.0,"You don‚Äôt ever have to apologize to me :) 

The past is a thought we have about something that happened and what we believe it means which is completely artificial.

The story of it is meaningless and doesn‚Äôt define what you actually are (awareness).

When we let go of all thought for 2-5 seconds, take a deep breath and let it go... we can feel the stillness and ease thats always already present in this NOW moment which is all there truly is.

Past and future projection happen in the NOW.

Think back to this experience where you felt guilt or a similar negative emotion...

Did you stop existing then?

No, you were completely present and existing in that moment and nothing can change that.

You‚Äôre ALWAYS ALREADY present and these thoughts, distractions, negative or ‚Äúbad things‚Äù... they‚Äôre simply confirming the beautiful and powerful FACT that the NOW is all there is because they‚Äôre appearing in this NOW moment.

You DO NOT have to suffer any longer :) 

And you CAN recognize this inner stillness and peace that is always available to you in this now moment.

This now moment is only full of acceptance and joy.

When we attach a label or meaning to what happened or what‚Äôs happening or what might happen and what we perceive to be ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, that‚Äôs when we suffer.

Those events in and of themselves say nothing about you :) 

That being said, I would highly recommend meditation as a powerful tool in helping you recognize your ‚Äúpresence‚Äù or ‚Äúawareness‚Äù and dropping this story (I don‚Äôt mean that to sound harsh) so you can relax into the peace and wellbeing that you most definitely deserve.

I can send you a link to join my Free Academy where I help you do just that if you‚Äôd like?"

spirituality,flc5q2v,t1_flc4yq1,1585020601.0,"Absolutely :) so... there‚Äôs two questions in here that I‚Äôm feeling.

If we‚Äôre infinity why do we do x?

Because you infinity wants to experience itself in an I finite number of ways and you are one of those beautiful and majestic expressions of the divine itself (or another way of saying that is you‚Äôre an extension of it).

Why do I need to do these things that I don‚Äôt want to do!

Because you believe you have to do them and your higher self won‚Äôt support you which is completely natural and okay to feel.

But notice how they don‚Äôt feel good..

So, what I would help you with in my Free Academy would be practice self-realization and dropping your negative perceptions/overlays/perspectives on what you‚Äôre doing because they aren‚Äôt negative.

Doing your job can be inherently beautiful even if it‚Äôs stocking cans or cleaning toilets.

You can experience profound peace doing that.

But you‚Äôre here for a purpose so let‚Äôs not stop at toilets, let‚Äôs identify what you‚Äôre here to do and what excites you.

What you‚Äôre passionate about.

The answer here is both self-realization and self-actualization. 

Let‚Äôs start with self-realization because you will have a stable foundation for self-actualization and empowering your life.
