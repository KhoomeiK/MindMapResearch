So bone broth apart from giving you a ton of nutrients that your body loves also has a lot of natural collagen. All that natural collagen can help coat your gi tract which can help it heal and prompt healthy bacteria. I added it to my diet skeptically a while ago and have just kept at it.

My sleep has never been better, sometimes I wake up sweating from a nightmare but I usually can‚Äôt recall it.

medicalmarijuana,f33bj8x,t1_f338ybp,1570635476.0,"So when you take edibles the not only does the effect take longer to come on depending on your body and how much food you have in your stomache, but it also kind of changes its effect because the liver is breaking it down. Edibles just were not enough for me I would have to eat handfuls daily to keep up. Vape pens I dont know they just dont feel good when I inhale they never have and I just dont trust the whole vaping thing. Again personal preference but flower out of a bong it just feels good ""for me"" and works. Your doctor is right though I am inhaling a % of plant material but Im ok with it. I smoke about an 1/8 of weed a week and am constantly trying to make sure I dont go over that. Ive tried to take a break completely but ill more than admit Im kind of dependent on it now. I can however cutback if I feel like my tolerance is getting to high. Ill cut out the occasional joint and just try to smoke 4 times a day spread out like 7am 11am 4pm 8pm is usually when i hit the bong. Bad days happen though and that's when ill smoke a bit more and then have to make a conscious effort to reel it in."
medicalmarijuana,f3239x6,t3_df3flj,1570592156.0,"I honestly just danced around smoking flower because I wanted to see if edibles or vapes would do it for me. Then after that first bong hit i knew it was for me. You just gotta experiment man, go to leafly or w.e and find some good strains for whatever your condition is then try to see if your dispensary has any. As far as how to consume it that‚Äôs all on you. Like i said i prefer to grind my flower and smoke from a bong. Edibles don‚Äôt do it for me, I‚Äôm home most of the time so i don‚Äôt need the convenience of a pen. I also enjoy bowls but like how bongs cools the smoke down a bit and sound cool when you hit it. Look it‚Äôs gonna be rough smoking it at first and you might question how or why someone would do this to their lungs, but your body will adapt and it becomes easier. Then once you‚Äôve used it for a while you can enjoy the eternal tolerance battle."

medicalmarijuana,f2uf6so,t3_dect4a,1570414957.0,"Honestly if one tiny edible will give you fantasitic sleep why not? I only smoke as much as i do because it‚Äôs what it takes for me to calm the fuck down. I don‚Äôt really see a downside to consuming one edible a night. Especially if it‚Äôs only 5-10 mg. Hell sometimes my wife takes some just because it works for her too in small doses for sleep. As far as getting a card I imagine the difficulty will all depend on how well documented your condition is, what state and which doctor you are seeing."

medicalmarijuana,f1shh3h,t3_dabkhf,1569728935.0,"Look, I went through a period of my life where I thought for sure my heart was failing. Noone could tell me otherwise, I gave myself so much anxiety that I actually caused inflamation in the lining of my chest which only further enforced my belief that my heart was failing. It took me literally over a year to just... calm down... relax... meditate. I used to hear that word ""meditate"" and scoff. Now I cant imagine getting on without it sometimes. Just seriously sit still, be still calm down and just focus on your breathing at first. calm man just caaalllm. Also I like to think of super pleasant innocent memories, like the sound of snow fall I was a child, or the sounds and smell of fall in late october in the forests of pennsylvania. just deep calm personal memories man if you have them just focus on them and kind of try to channel that care free relaxed feeling you had at that time. As far as the dosage goes its kind of a personal thing, I can eat alot of edibles and never really notice their effect, I just prefer to smoke flower from my bong and try to stick to indicas or indica dominant hybrids, I really like super glue, don corleone, and grandaddy purps/ all of its variants."

I smoked cigs years ago in the army, i dunno if that has something to do with it or not.i have my medical card for anxiety. Again this is just a personal note but smoking has been what‚Äôs helped the most, particularly indica strains. I‚Äôve tried tinctures, gummies, chocolate, concentrates such as shatter and wax. In the end though I always just prefer to smoke some flower. My dispensary sells suppositories but I‚Äôm not that desperate yet. I go for a run once a week it‚Äôs been a couple months since i started but still no issues with my cardio or breathing/lungs. Sometimes smoking was harsh i started with a bowl but once i got a bong and discovered the water cooling effects on the smoke it was a game changer. In the end though I think marijuana was beneficial but overall like the whole lifestyle change did the heavy lifting in giving me relief."
