Fast forward 5 years here I am super depressed an now I can't believe there was a time when I wasn't depressed. Isn't this like so much fun??"

AskReddit,ffucxgz,t3_ev5gkp,1580239334.0,"Through out history just about every major religion has had corruption, scandals and have done horrible things in the name of their god/gods. They also have been used to manipulate and control the population with fear and punishments. Without  any concrete evidence of a god/gods I would rather distance myself from from these establishments and just live my life doing what I want, where I want, when i want, as long as Im being a good person and not effecting anyone else in a negative way. I don't need all these guidelines and fear mongering to live a good life. That being said I do still respect anyone's choice to follow any religion of they want  as long as they aren't assholes about it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

Yet everyday is a struggle I'm sad and empty all the time and I want nothing more than to die.

When does it get better guys?"

Thanks,

depression,f0h0w39,t3_d4r3tk,1568610466.0,"This is exactly what I needed to see, thank you so much for sharing this. I've been unable to move on for the past 4 months because im too scared to give up the love and memories and moments we shared, I need to accept that no matter what I'll never have those exact things back. But that doesn't mean I can't make new and better ones with someone else, it's definitely going to be a process and not a easy one, but I needed to understand that just because those particular memories and feelings will never be recreated or our dreams and hopes we shared together will never come true, that doesn't mean there won't be new/better ones with someone else. Thank you from the bottom of my hear stranger for helping me take the first step in the right direction, good luck on your journey!"

depression,eyx5636,t1_eywuf6l,1567545040.0,Unfortunately its was a mutual breakup that we both agreed would be best do to certain things going on in our lives. I still stand by the decision but it makes it so much harder knowing that we both still love each other but can't be together. I some times wish i could just hate her so it would be easier to deal with but now I'm just stuck here. I feel so wrong even thinking about finding a new girlfriend.
