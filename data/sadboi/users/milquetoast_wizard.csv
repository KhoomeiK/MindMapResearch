*****SPOILERS BELOW FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED SCENARIO******

It’s a modern scenario, but it involves the players acting as a salvage team on a ghost ship. Long story short , the creature is massive, but also invisible, it can only be seen when a character is touching something made of silver, but it also has a very tough time navigating the tight hallways so it’s easy to escape from but you’re still never sure where exactly it might be.

Besides that, I think backstory length is pretty subjective. I wanted to explain away his very high brawl skill and give him a little more character depth. This doesn’t all need to come out in the first play session. I imagine he’s just a normal dock worker until the other players get to know him or his seedier past comes back into play depending on how the keeper wants to use it. 
I didn’t really think about how he was involved in WWI, I think rather than retcon the story I have for him I might just say that the drafts happened after he had fled New York and there wasn’t really a record of him in Boston since he was basically in hiding so he was never asked to join.

3d6,fc0dvtw,t1_fc0d2d3,1577288121.0,"Agreed that it could be done if the water was positioned above the person, but it would be hard to drop something on someone from 5 feet"
3d6,fc08746,t3_efg4v7,1577282613.0,"Here’s the spell:

You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.

- You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.

- You change the water’s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.

- You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

So- you cast it to remove up to the volume of one 5 ft cube of water from a body of water, and force it 5 feet into the air, as per point 1. Again, this is only 5 feet away from where it originated and does not have enough force to cause damage according to the rules. This is also instantaneous, once it moves it is no longer affected by the spell, you just have the volume of one 5ft cube of water in a different spot. In this case, on the floor as it can not be suspended in the air. Even if you can, it’s only 5 feet so it couldn’t be dropped on a medium creature or bigger. 
You would also have to cast it a second time to freeze it which does last for an hour. But I don’t agree that you could use the spell to then manipulate the ice. If it refers to ice and also water in the text of the spell, it would certainly delineate that the abilities apply to both phases, which it does not. 
This is a cantrip and is clearly meant only as a utility power, not to cause damage. If your DM is okay with the way it’s being used then that’s fine, but you have not found some loophole in the RAW to use it as a massive damage boost without even the expenditure of a spell slot."
