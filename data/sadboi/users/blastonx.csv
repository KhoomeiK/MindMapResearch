Try visualization exercises. There are 2 exercises I've found helpful. One is rather easy and it's representative of the 2nd of the 12 steps. Visualize yourself in a place where you're not being affected as much by thought blocking, where you can draw from other places in the mind when the thought crashes.

This second one is something I do less frequently as it's profoundness goes a little deeper than I was aware was possible. And I knew this was the case before I started because I found this technique in a book called think and grow rich, very profound. Ok so if you could call a business meeting, get a board room together, where the topic of discussion was accomplishing your goals and making your life go the way you want to go. Who would you want in there? Actually right these names down, Russell Brand, Jeff Bezoz, Mark Merrill, ECT., ECT., Pick people that are relevant for you, not me.
Visualize yourself in a room with these people for enough minutes that your satisfied with the results, I like to call it multi-ego visualizations but it's more important the actual ephemeral being is there.

So yeah in my conversations I've unlocked this cool power to visualize and conceptualize what people are telling me so even if I lose the train of thought I can still have an image in my head so I don't lose the concept even if words are fucking with me. Still not perfect though.
