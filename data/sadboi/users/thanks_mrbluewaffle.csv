So two years ago I made it to v6 but life got in the way and I had to stop. A couple of months ago I got back into climbing but I seem to be stuck on v2/v3.

I realize I never really had a set routine and I'm starting to try a solid workout schedule and I was hoping for some sound advice. I read that climbing three times a week is suggested and I downloaded the beast master app to help me while I use the hang board. 

so what types of workout schedules would y'all suggest? I was hoping for five days a week, I live about ten minutes away from my gym and was hoping to go in the mornings before work. 

Im not concerned about going to v4 or up right now, I know I'm technically still a beginner so im taking a step back and looking at improving my form and technique before I try to advance. 

thank you and I look forward to any advice!"
