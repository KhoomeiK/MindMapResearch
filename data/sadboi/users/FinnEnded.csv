yandere_simulator,fokf5rr,t3_g7rmgd,1587840928.0,"I feel the same way. I would use it in the actual game if I was frustrated about getting caught or getting a game over. I don't have a massive problem with it since I'm not really going to use it, but I was really disappointed. I don't know what I expected but it wasn't the current SNAP mode. I guess I put it on a pedestal and I was super excited about it and then my expectations were too high.

Oh, well. Just my thoughts."

depression,f0tf9lj,t1_f0t7eyf,1568921078.0,"Well, just understand that people with depression are not motivated to do anything. You have to give her a shove, and I'll be honest, you gotta be pushy, but don't pressure her. She won't be motivated to do anything on her own, so just kinda say ""You'll enjoy it, I promise."" Get her to go, give her a good time, and things will get better. Make sure it's something in her interest though lol

I hope this help, sorry if I'm not clear enough, and good luck!"

depression,f0t1qc9,t3_d6eyx1,1568914431.0,It sounds like you're not willing to help yourself... medication doesn't help all but at least try it. Therapy isn't for all either... but try a few different ones before you get negative and give up.

AskReddit,f0sxn8g,t3_c00es4,1568912368.0,"I stopped wallowing and self-pity and sadness because I realized that it's pushing people away. I blocked depression pages on Instagram and Facebook because I didn't want to relate to them anymore. I cut out people who talked about their sadness all the time because they were toxic for me, I cut out all the drama. Once I cut out all the dread, I started to feel great. I still have it, but I believe I've battled it's worst effects out of my life."

depression,f0suz91,t1_f0sey8v,1568911074.0,"I agree with this. You have to find the right person for you. Depression makes you feel tired and have no motivation to do anything, it doesn't make you sad. My boyfriend understands this and against my will forces me to get out and have fun, he really has helped and he loves me for the unmotivated weirdo I am. Find the right person and you will be fine.

Just keep fighting for the person you love."
depression,f0pzuvr,t3_d60j6j,1568851171.0,"No, they do. They do have mental health awareness since you can‚Äôt go anywhere around a school without seeing ‚ÄúMental Health Line‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Not Alone‚Äù. They just don‚Äôt understand how their actions affect others. They don‚Äôt know who they‚Äôre bullying and if they have depression or not. Just don‚Äôt dwell on them. I have depression and as soon as I started not dwelling in self sorrow and pity, I didn‚Äôt need to take my medication anymore. I felt great. Screw the people who are bullying you. Talk it out with friends but don‚Äôt dwell on it. People would be a lot happier if they did this. I love everyone and sometimes I lose myself to the human nature of judging others, move on, you got this! Screw those people, keep going. It gets better, I swear."
