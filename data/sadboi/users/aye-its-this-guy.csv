Psychonaut,fqwbj4x,t3_gl71bs,1589698669.0,I bought an ounce of mdma back in 2013 and was in a bad place. I did like 3/4 of it to the face and caused a psychotic break before ending up in jail. My brain took years to start feeling normal again. I still can sleep way more than I used to so maybe I permanently changed my brain. I was really stupid but addiction can happen. I don’t want to knock the drug but I was using it to escape and it wasn’t smart.

I’m 28 too and live with my mom and my girlfriend. I thought it would never get better but it did for me. You should stay and just keep working on things to improve how you feel. I promise it will get better. DM me if you want to talk about anything. I sleep a lot too lol

I got arrested and faced 2 felony charges which were expunged after a year probation on a plea bargain
Psychonaut,fpr7fvj,t1_fpr3dko,1588845149.0,People think you need to be out on your own as soon as possible to be happy. I live with my girlfriend and my mom who would be living by herself if we moved out. I check in with her every once in a while to see if I still seem like a good roommate and she asks the same. I think she’s happier with us here. Eventually I want to get my own place and get a dog(moms allergic) but until then I’m gonna enjoy this time

Psychosis,fp0s6xz,t3_gaipng,1588215742.0,"I took to many drugs (stimulants, psychedelics, weed) then had a psychotic break which they deemed drug related. My psychosis kept appearing on and off when I was sober each time taking longer to get out of. Was later diagnosed with BPD with bouts of mania. Was given Respirdal and I’m still on it but my psychosis is gone. It’ll come back along with mania for 20 minutes to 1 day but gets shut down pretty quickly. I don’t know if Respirdal is doing anything but I feel weird when I’m not on it so I keep taking it"
DMT,fp0mxza,t1_foxfb8h,1588212529.0,That’s why I haven’t blasted off a second time
DMT,fp0mujn,t1_foxdpaq,1588212471.0,I blasted off one time and flew through octagonal dimensions which looked like outer space until I arrived at these mew-like beings which kept sending me stuff and were dancing while doing it. Then I arrived at this psychedelic goddess looking being(it was only her head I could see) who projected to me the most loving feeling I have ever experienced. It was pure ecstasy. Then my vision was directed to a golden body which got brighter and brighter then exploded until my vision was all golden light. Then I woke up. A lot of my dreams have either been psychedelic in nature sense then or a lot of them are difficult to deal with. I am much more lucid since then. I just hope I’m not in trouble for what I experienced because I don’t think people should naturally experience that much pleasure at once in this lifetime. Many of my dreams seem like I’m stuck in hell trying to put in enough work to get myself to move on. I can’t tell if it’s because of what I did.
DMT,fp0lzoi,t1_foxjsfv,1588211964.0,When the ego goes it can be intense and scary or it can be freeing. There is a lot to take away from such an experience. Can you shed the parts of you which help you continue on your spiritual path?

Psychosis,fotu9qo,t3_g10oiy,1588066350.0,I had weed and adderall induced psychosis. Then I took some mushrooms and lsd together. Then I went on an ecstasy binge (almost snorted a whole ounce) then I overdosed. Went to the psych hospital then left and went to jail cuz my parents told the police about the drugs they found in my apartment. Spent 2 and a half weeks awake the whole time in my cell psychotic as fuck. Took me forever to come back from that one lol I’m not so reckless with my mind anymore. I’m sober besides Kratom and cbd and rarely have episodes anymore and if I do it’s not even for a full day. Psychosis feels so good until the crash lol
LucidDreaming,fottyvt,t3_g74prw,1588066046.0,While I’m awake I feel something playing with my genitals constantly. Then it moves up my spine and out of my head. I don’t know what it is but I’m so used to it that it doesn’t even get me horny anymore lol

NearDeathExperiences,fottrk1,t1_fottlb1,1588065835.0,So you remembered stuff outside of being in the drug induced coma which seems to mean like there’s more consciousness outside of the brain
NearDeathExperiences,fottod6,t1_fotti6r,1588065743.0,I know exactly what you mean. I long for more and life is just the pause in between my crazy dreams that I enjoy. I feel like I have the same feeling of regret sometimes. Like how did I not die?
NearDeathExperiences,fottcyj,t1_fott12v,1588065419.0,When I overdosed everything went black but I woke up feeling well rested like I just spent some time in a better place
NearDeathExperiences,fottbg4,t1_fott12v,1588065377.0,That’s a pretty crazy story. Maybe you were just held there by some spiritual force instead of floating away. Maybe some of your soul did leave your body and some of it stayed with you. Maybe you’re operating on multiple planes of existence at the same time. Putting in that spiritual work
Psychosis,fott7aa,t1_fotsedz,1588065259.0,Apparently you’re supposed to go through a series of initiations to see if you’re ready to ascend to the next level. There’s multiple levels that you try to ascend through but once you do you have obtained your solar body or your Christ body and you move to a higher dimension. If you obtain this you can materialize back into the physical world at your will and your consciousness never dies as you move through the spiritual realms. It sounds a little far fetched but it would be awesome if possible at all. Maybe it’s what all this dream warrior shit is about lol the only thing is you might die in the physical when you get it but it’s like level up haha

depression,fots63k,t3_g99heb,1588064206.0,Exactly what I go through but I think I want to see if there’s more on the other side. I don’t want to go yet but I think about it casually too. Don’t think I’m depressed but I’m tired all the time. I’m so active in my dreams that it leaves me sleepy during the day. I don’t think I’m anxious all the time either. It kinda sucks that nobody really understands I don’t have anyone to talk to about it.
Psychosis,fotrz1r,t1_fotrdak,1588064008.0,Yeah I do too man. Sounds like my dreams in a dystopian world. I put in work too but I feel like I’m left exhausted from it in my day to day life. I get pissed during the day but I love the night.

Psychosis,fotm224,t1_fotk3xf,1588058186.0,I get what you’re saying about how it breaks through to metaphysical constructs. I have the craziest lucid dreams that I used to link to reality. Now I can separate the two and I’m doing much better. I even had a dream where I met Jesus but in that headspace he just scared me awake which sucked. I’m currently taking one class and trying to get better so I can handle more responsibilities. It sucks that I live with my mom but my girlfriend lives here with me too. I hope I can ground myself enough to handle the daily grind as I get older. It’s tough though man. Sometime I take days off respirdal but if my thoughts get weird I go back on it. Such a slippery slope but it’s how my brain works.
Psychosis,fotlqkk,t1_fotixz0,1588057885.0,Zyprexa sucks man. When I was psychotic and in jail I would cheek that shit and snort it in my cell. It calmed me down so I thought snorting it was giving me a high lol my psychosis always made me do stupid shit

AskReddit,flw8lyn,t3_fre3wa,1585542668.0,"I used to know a lot of people but I had a few psychotic episodes where things got weird. I lost all of my friends in those times except one who lives in a different state. I spent multiple years by myself at home receiving disability for my situation. I got better and take meds which keep me kinda in a drowsy state. I have a girlfriend now who stays around but sometimes don’t feel anything for her. Probably a chemical imbalance still going on. We live with my mom who I put through all of this. My family and my girlfriend show they care but I just feel alone in my head. I feel less lonely than I used to but feel depressed on a daily basis for ruining my own life with my episodes of crazy which felt better than being in this state. I feel like my girlfriend can tell I’m not feeling into her sometimes but it washes over when those moods go away and I feel better about her. It’s weird having a brain like mine I can’t quite put my finger on it. 

I kinda rambled but I’ve never really discussed this before. Things have improved but I still feel alone and sleep most days from being so tired. It hard to function but I’m taking a class right now to work towards a nursing degree. Moving to online classes has made my grades worse and me more lonely. I guess I should be happy with my improvements in life but sometimes I think about ending it because I can’t manage my own mind very well. It sucks but what can you do?"
