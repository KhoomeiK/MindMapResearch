In the building across from me, in the corner part was apartment 7106. I hated it so much. It gave me horrible feelings all the time, and I remember a friend and I looked in one day (it was always empty, any time someone moved in the place would flood) and all of a sudden the inside is covered in blood, there's a girl in a bloody white nightgown hanging, and we heard someone tell us to go. No one else was outside. We ran back to my place and when we got there we noticed my dogs toe was bleeding. We didn't run that far, nor did we run into anything that could have torn up his toe. I've never been able to explain it. Plus, one time I had to walk by it and when I looked at the shadow of the stairs knives were hanging off. No knives anywhere in sight. I was so relieved when we moved away.

Tbh, I would not be surprised if they did not buy the proper things to care for this puppy, and coming from someone who brought home a 4 week old, they do not want a puppy that wasn't ready to leave mom. That's a difficult dog to take care of, and I worry that she won't get the care she needs. 
Try to keep your dog away from her, she's not old enough for her shots and she could get very sick being around your dog. They need to be separated at all times. Remember, she's still a baby so she's going to do baby things. Try to find out what momma dogs do to teach their pups how to dog. Be patient.

Thetruthishere,fofdypt,t3_g720ed,1587733710.0,"The property next door, which my landlord bought before buying the land I'm on now. There used to be an abandoned camper, mobile home, and barn over there. Every time I went over there I felt so uneasy. Their things were still in all those buildings, like they had to grab what they could and get out. The property I'm on makes me uneasy too. Part of it is in the valley, and there's a creek down there. It felt like there was a barrier at night and I did my best to stay away from them. I kept getting flashes of things happening there, like a baptism and it went even further back than that. We found a pair of boots and an old scarecrow when we moved here, and I don't even want to remember what else. At night, you'd hear footsteps right outside the door of my uncle's old office building (just a metal shed tbh) but no one would be out there. I saw and felt a lot of weird things, and I'm honestly grateful to be moving in 2 weeks. This is in SC.
I lived in Arizona for 8 years and let me tell you, that entire state does not function the way it should spiritually. I'm sure you've heard of towns disappearing and appearing, but I saw some awful things while living In a specific apt. One apartment had something bad wrong with it. One time I looked in there and it was covered in blood and a girl was hanging, wearing a white nightgown. Covered in blood. It was awful. I heard something tell me to go even though I was alone. I saw knives hanging from the stairs in the shadows. I avoided that one at all costs, going the long way around. In my own apt, across the way from it, weird shit happened too. One of my rats got loose in my brothers room, and his friend was there. We went back in to look for my rat again, and saw its head laying there. It turned and made an awful noise and had bright red eyes. We ran back to my room, waiting, went back in, and there my rat was in the middle of the floor. Whole. Like nothing happened. Another time my youngest brother, my mom, neighbor girl and I were watching A Haunting. My lil bro had fallen asleep and suddenly sat straight up with blood shot eyes and said, ""I didn't do it! Not to all of them! Not all of them!"" Needless to say, we shut the tv off. 
Same complex, different apt. The ghost of the dude that had a crush on my mom who had killed his gf and himself years ago appeared to me. He wasn't bad, but he scared me at first. He stuck around for a while but it's been a long time since I've heard from him. He was the most pleasant ghost experience I've had tbh lol. But I'm glad he's finally at peace cause he was just full of sorrow and regret. He got in a bad way before he died and his gf had gotten him on drugs and really fucked him up. 
Anyway that's all I can remember rn. My only advice is trust your gut and do not fuck with Arizona or it will fuck with you."

AmItheAsshole,fobyoyp,t3_g6mout,1587665168.0,"NTA, you have the kids well being in mind while they're treating this like buying a shiny new toy. That's selfish and would probably be traumatizing for the kids. I don't have a great relationship with my siblings either but that would not stop my girlfriend and I from adopting more than one. Granted, I only want one child but if there are siblings we will make it work. That's how it should be, and I applaud you both for taking on the challenge of 4 kids. It sounds like you need new friends tbh, and they need to grow the fuck up."
