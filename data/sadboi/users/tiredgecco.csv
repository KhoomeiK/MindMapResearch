It’s to keep people to not come unnecessarily to complain about minor issues but to keep the bill as low so if you have a serious injury or something you wouldn’t hesitate.

obgyn,fqyqnwe,t1_fqynnoy,1589752953.0,"I’m so sorry to hear that. 

You really should look for your own place. Your mom seems really controlling and toxic, I could even use the term abusive even though it’s a really strong word and things are not ever black and white. You are an adult and you need more privacy. You might think you can’t hurt your mothers feelings but really, she is making your life so much worse. You struggle with your mental health and your mother seems almost like a burden. You deserve to live your life independently. You are an adult an as much as your mother thinks she’s protecting you and wants to control stuff in your life, she doesn’t have any legal or ethical rights to tell you anything. 

Trust me you need to move out. Your mother seems messing really badly with how you live your life and that’s wrong. Giving advice is always good but giving orders to an adult is wrong. 

I hope everything becomes better and that you could have some privacy. I see that your mother stresses about you becoming like your father but it’s not that easy and just because she claims doing the right thing to protect you, it’s not her job anymore."
obgyn,fqym89e,t3_glmhb6,1589750871.0,"I’m sorry but are you really 23? Like your behavior gives me different idea. It’s totally okay but I just thought bc you said that you will get on birth control without your mom knowing about it after this, why would she be against it if you are 23? Also you mentioned about not tracking your cycle, not having a license and not having a car and stuff like this seems that you act like a teenager. I’m sorry if I offend you that’s not my intention!! 
Also there’s no way knowing if you are pregnant or not without a test. You NEED to start tracking your cycles, download for example WomanLog or Flo. 

Also if you are 23 and your period cramps are that painful you need 2-3 capsules of ibuprofen three times a day YOU NEED TO BOOK A GYNECOLOGIST APPOINTMENT. That could be endometriosis since it’s not normal to have that painful periods over 3-4 years after your periods started and/or after you hit 18-20 years old your periods should be tracked, not that painful and you should really have a good idea how your body works. Really painful periods are itself a reason to book a gynecologist appointment. Where do you live? Do you have decent sex ed? What kinda relationship do you have with you mother, can you talk about stuff like this? 

I recommend to ask your mom to go and buy you a pregnancy test. Your age doesn’t matter if you can’t handle to raise a child, you should know as soon as possible. Also you mentioned about poor diet, depression and anxiety. Does your mom know about them? You should really reach for help if you haven’t already. 

+ if the guy was just a hookup, not having a condom can result to pregnancy but ALSO into STD’s so I hope you both were honest and have been checked up."
AskDocs,fqychym,t1_fqy9sil,1589746363.0,"Technically they have the legal right to say no for prescriptions without seeing the patient but I think it’s ethically not right to rewrite OLD prescriptions that are ESSENTIAL even if they haven’t seen them in one year but during the global lockdown the most important thing would be that people would stay home and so that there would be safe to be. If doctors suspicious about “abusing” I don’t think it’s ethical to just say “no. you need to wait” for lifesaving medication, if they are not comfortable to prescribe without seeing the patient they should suggest a video meeting.

Monitor it for 3-7 days. If it gets swollen, painful, reddish and discharges yellow-greenish fluids and starts to smell it means there is a bacterial infection. It doesn’t always need professional treatment even if slightly infected symptoms would occur but if the area starts to really show those symptoms I mentioned before then it might need antibiotics but that’s the worse case scenario.

medical_advice,fqt4ms1,t3_gkqmg9,1589629819.0,"Not infected. Just irritated. Wash them daily with warm water and use gentle body lotion/moisturizer with no additional scent or anything. Let them breathe so do not pack them up with lots off stuff but maybe a mild breathable protection there so you don’t scratch and it doesn’t get more irritated. Do not use too much disinfect because that irritates and dries up the skin. Use for moisturizer for example Vanicream, NIVEA, CeraVe, something they recommend for babies means it’s should be okay for sensitive skin and would be as natural as possible. 

Self harm scars/cuts like yours will always be a couple days warm and bit bloated, reddish and itchy. That doesn’t mean they are infected, that is normal. Those same symptoms occur if infected but they are really, really much more obvious. If you feel unsure, buy antibacterial cream. If it still looks like that after 5-7 days you might consider consulting someone again. 

Edit:

I’m pretty sure that you know those are not infected. Google also gives you pretty clear image and symptoms what infected is. Showing self harm is pretty common way to search for validation but it’s wrong, you might seriously trigger someone who is trying to stay clean. Next time anyone posts about self harm do it so you mark it NSFW, don’t post the image on reddit but post it through link on imgur and add here a serious trigger warning. I know these days are hard but pretty much most of us is on the same boat. You need to search for a therapist or professional to talk about what makes you self harm and why you feel that bad.

There is actually a diagnosis F50.1 Anorexia nervosa atypical : symptoms look like anorexia but one or more criteria doesn’t fill. It’s for example: person is underweight, starving and fearing of food but her hormonal system is working and she still has libido and gets her periods so it’s not anorexia nervosa. 
Or then person has all the symptoms of anorexia nervosa but is overweight, then she/he is diagnosed with anorexia nervosa atypical which is as valid as “normal anorexia”, both are forms of anorexia and you can struggle with anorexia being normal/ overweight, the diagnosis will just be the F50.1 instead of F50.0 but that’s just medical stuff and the illness is the same but it just appears with different symptoms. It’s not EDNOS, it’s atypical anorexia. 
There is also F50.2 bulimia nervosa and F50.3 bulimia nervosa atypical where one or more base criteria isn’t fitting. EDNOS diagnostical code is F50.9. All eating disorders are as valid no matter what your diagnosis is. But anorexia and not underweight doesn’t automatically mean it’s EDNOS, there are atypical diagnoses.

But the act to fully cover up your body and face is sexists and objectifying and horrible. It’s a crime against human rights. But women have no other choice in countries where it’s assumed/required that women cover them up with burkas. Burkas tell you that it’s your fault that you were born as a women, you need to cover yourself in order to protect yourself from crimes because for example rape is your fault if your not fully covered because men can not do anything about it if they see your skin. So if you dont wanna get targeted and blamed, cover yourself. And also! Just and only your husband has the right to see and enjoy from your body. It’s only for him and your job is to make him happy.

insaneparents,fqm7odr,t1_fqm50j4,1589472901.0,Are you Swedish? It’s crazy out there. I’ve few relatives that lives there and they told us it’s crazy. My grandma’s nieces kids won’t go to daycare even they are all open and they are just thankful that they are not in the age they’d be forced going into school because there are all schools open. Sorry if this comment doesn’t make any sense oops
SuicideWatch,fqlutxz,t3_gjjzw4,1589466484.0,"I really hope you are safe. I’ve no words because you just described my thoughts and I’ve no idea if this ever gets better. I can’t promise anything. But I do not want you to disappear. I know that you don’t feel like anything’s making any sense and stuff. I know you feel numbness and pain in the same time. But even I don’t know you, I just wish you wouldn’t hurt yourself. Please. I know this might sound selfish from me to ask but I just keep hoping that 20 years from this day you would be there grateful that you didn’t end this life now. Go get a tattoo. Eat food you’ve not tasted before. Don’t you dare do anything before you have binge watched every possible Netflix original production. Don’t you dare to give up before you can speak English, Japanese, German and Spanish. Don’t give up yet. Whatever (legal) you need to do cope, do that."
depression,fqlsopx,t3_gjjnzd,1589465333.0,Thank you thank you thank you for saying this out loud!! 😭 I feel this. I feel bad for thinking this way but also a bit like “finally it’s not just me who get to experience something that’s not that funny and mess up your plans living in a constant fog of not knowing how long this will continue” kinda thoughts just give me comfort that I’m not miserable alone

I’m not sure if she is in her late 20s or in her 50s like what she is really beautiful but something isn’t just adding up with this look :( she would rock in peachy color lipstick and bright & warm toned makeup!

I freakin hate when ppl glamorize eating disorders, calls it by cute names and think it’s an AeStHeTiC and not a freakin disorder. Pretty flowers, skinny legs, broken heart and quirky mind 🥰✨🍓🎡🧚🏻‍♀️💞💫✨🧚🏻‍♀️💞🧚🏻‍♀️💞🧚🏻‍♀️🦋🐝🦄🦞🌺🌼🌹🌻🌜🌗🌑🌞🐚🍂 like no. It’s not cute. It’s a freakin hellhole of black humor, ironic destruction and dark memes while crying because your chest hurts but it’s probably because of your ED so it’s fine and you are not worth going to the doctor so let’s keep on living in destruction"

fatlogic,fqfnj03,t1_fqfh0us,1589328124.0,"You know absolutely nothing. I know that it seems  maybe that everyone has history with anorexia but that’s mostly because you are on sites that talks about that kinda stuff, like this  sub. Also anorexia can also be diagnosed as atypical and is as valid as the “typical”. Atypical eating disorders are the most common eating disorders. Also At least 30 million people of all ages and genders suffer from an eating disorder in the U.S.

13% of women over 50 engage in eating disorder behaviors.5
In a large national study of college students, 3.5% sexual minority women and 2.1% of sexual minority men reported having an eating disorder.6
16% of transgender college students reported having an eating disorder.6

It’s not as rare and uncommon as you think. You are acting really invalidating. 
It seems like a new epidemic now but the truth is that it’s always been here but only now people are speaking out loud about it. 

And yes a comment like yours even thought you are a random anonymous redditor can make people question everything."
