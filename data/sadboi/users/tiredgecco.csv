obgyn,fqyqnwe,t1_fqynnoy,1589752953.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that. 

You really should look for your own place. Your mom seems really controlling and toxic, I could even use the term abusive even though it‚Äôs a really strong word and things are not ever black and white. You are an adult and you need more privacy. You might think you can‚Äôt hurt your mothers feelings but really, she is making your life so much worse. You struggle with your mental health and your mother seems almost like a burden. You deserve to live your life independently. You are an adult an as much as your mother thinks she‚Äôs protecting you and wants to control stuff in your life, she doesn‚Äôt have any legal or ethical rights to tell you anything. 

Trust me you need to move out. Your mother seems messing really badly with how you live your life and that‚Äôs wrong. Giving advice is always good but giving orders to an adult is wrong. 

I hope everything becomes better and that you could have some privacy. I see that your mother stresses about you becoming like your father but it‚Äôs not that easy and just because she claims doing the right thing to protect you, it‚Äôs not her job anymore."
obgyn,fqym89e,t3_glmhb6,1589750871.0,"I‚Äôm sorry but are you really 23? Like your behavior gives me different idea. It‚Äôs totally okay but I just thought bc you said that you will get on birth control without your mom knowing about it after this, why would she be against it if you are 23? Also you mentioned about not tracking your cycle, not having a license and not having a car and stuff like this seems that you act like a teenager. I‚Äôm sorry if I offend you that‚Äôs not my intention!! 
Also there‚Äôs no way knowing if you are pregnant or not without a test. You NEED to start tracking your cycles, download for example WomanLog or Flo. 

Also if you are 23 and your period cramps are that painful you need 2-3 capsules of ibuprofen three times a day YOU NEED TO BOOK A GYNECOLOGIST APPOINTMENT. That could be endometriosis since it‚Äôs not normal to have that painful periods over 3-4 years after your periods started and/or after you hit 18-20 years old your periods should be tracked, not that painful and you should really have a good idea how your body works. Really painful periods are itself a reason to book a gynecologist appointment. Where do you live? Do you have decent sex ed? What kinda relationship do you have with you mother, can you talk about stuff like this? 

I recommend to ask your mom to go and buy you a pregnancy test. Your age doesn‚Äôt matter if you can‚Äôt handle to raise a child, you should know as soon as possible. Also you mentioned about poor diet, depression and anxiety. Does your mom know about them? You should really reach for help if you haven‚Äôt already. 

+ if the guy was just a hookup, not having a condom can result to pregnancy but ALSO into STD‚Äôs so I hope you both were honest and have been checked up."

Let them breathe so do not pack them up with lots off stuff but maybe a mild breathable protection there so you don‚Äôt scratch and it doesn‚Äôt get more irritated. Do not use too much disinfect because that irritates and dries up the skin. Use for moisturizer for example Vanicream, NIVEA, CeraVe, something they recommend for babies means it‚Äôs should be okay for sensitive skin and would be as natural as possible. 

Self harm scars/cuts like yours will always be a couple days warm and bit bloated, reddish and itchy. That doesn‚Äôt mean they are infected, that is normal. Those same symptoms occur if infected but they are really, really much more obvious. If you feel unsure, buy antibacterial cream. If it still looks like that after 5-7 days you might consider consulting someone again. 

Edit:

I‚Äôm pretty sure that you know those are not infected. Google also gives you pretty clear image and symptoms what infected is. Showing self harm is pretty common way to search for validation but it‚Äôs wrong, you might seriously trigger someone who is trying to stay clean. Next time anyone posts about self harm do it so you mark it NSFW, don‚Äôt post the image on reddit but post it through link on imgur and add here a serious trigger warning.

All eating disorders are as valid no matter what your diagnosis is. But anorexia and not underweight doesn‚Äôt automatically mean it‚Äôs EDNOS, there are atypical diagnoses. I don‚Äôt mean to attack but the way you said your point could make some people in this sub feel invalid and harmful. ‚ù§Ô∏è stay safe everyone"

But the act to fully cover up your body and face is sexists and objectifying and horrible. It‚Äôs a crime against human rights. But women have no other choice in countries where it‚Äôs assumed/required that women cover them up with burkas. Burkas tell you that it‚Äôs your fault that you were born as a women, you need to cover yourself in order to protect yourself from crimes because for example rape is your fault if your not fully covered because men can not do anything about it if they see your skin. So if you dont wanna get targeted and blamed, cover yourself. And also! Just and only your husband has the right to see and enjoy from your body. It‚Äôs only for him and your job is to make him happy. 
Burkas has nothing to do with religion, it‚Äôs on act of authority, position and power. Women must wear burkas in most places in Middle East because if they don‚Äôt, they get punished, they could in most radical situations end up getting killed. But yeah I know that was not the point, the point is that the post is horrible, it‚Äôs just so wrong and the point is that masks for medical protection is completely different than covering yourself completely because of belief but that moron who made the ‚Äúfunny smart meme‚Äù is a complete moron."

fatlogic,fqfnj03,t1_fqfh0us,1589328124.0,"You know absolutely nothing. I know that it seems  maybe that everyone has history with anorexia but that‚Äôs mostly because you are on sites that talks about that kinda stuff, like this  sub. Also anorexia can also be diagnosed as atypical and is as valid as the ‚Äútypical‚Äù. Atypical eating disorders are the most common eating disorders. Also At least 30 million people of all ages and genders suffer from an eating disorder in the U.S.

13% of women over 50 engage in eating disorder behaviors.5
In a large national study of college students, 3.5% sexual minority women and 2.1% of sexual minority men reported having an eating disorder.6
16% of transgender college students reported having an eating disorder.6

It‚Äôs not as rare and uncommon as you think. You are acting really invalidating. 
It seems like a new epidemic now but the truth is that it‚Äôs always been here but only now people are speaking out loud about it. 

And yes a comment like yours even thought you are a random anonymous redditor can make people question everything."
