I feel like a lot of people disagree because they wouldn’t want to change who they are but let me tell u I don’t give a crap if it changes who I am - I’m miserable, angry, and resentful, I’m agoraphobic and never go out and haven’t had friends or seen friends in 2 years. I’ve learned how to be grateful for small “happy” moments out of survival but that’s it, when the windows are open and it’s pouring rain at 3 in the morning and you know it’s just yourself and nothing else.. but I could still have these moments otherwise.. I wouldn’t wish my childhood on anyone. It deeply scarred me, I wasn’t even aloud to go to school until I was 13 so the abuse could go un detected.. So yeah I agree.. sure for some people their abuse “makes or breaks them”. But for the people who it completely broke down. I think they’d also agree. 

Sorry if that was depressing, I just never see people say this, and when I read things.. watch things.. the survivor always says they wouldn’t re do their life if they could.. they’re grateful for what they went through, it made them. It upsets me in a way of just not feeling understood, it makes me feel like I have to be grateful for my abuse. And it “happened for a reason”, but I just don’t believe in that stuff, it’s good if you do tho! Not taking that away from anyone. Honestly though, we can still make a life for ourselves it’ll just take time. We can re create happy memories with lovely people and try to find happiness."

It can last for hours, half a day.. a full day.. when things get really bad I’ve gone weeks more regressed then not, basically I’d just go in a weird robot state to cook or whatever... 

I don’t think it’s a bad coping mechanism until it gets unhealthy, like if your doing it so much to the point you can’t do daily activities and tasks.. although it’s more of a automatic brain coping mechanism so who knows maybe that’s what the body and mind needs in that time in order to survive. But yes as far as I’m concerned, it’s normal for ptsd, and other mental disorders. Especially trauma disorders. And don’t feel embarrassed or weird. There’s many people out there that do this.

I’ve personally experienced the consequences of their actions that have nothing to do with me.

It can cause anxiety, hallucinations even, rapid weight loss, hair loss. All different sick symptoms. Etc.

But honestly people make mistakes, it’s not like you do this all the time (at least anymore, as u said u used to lash out more it’s good ur making progress!) you aren’t abusive, you felt excluded and betrayed it’s  a normal human instinct and if they can’t get over it that’s on them. I’ve had friends do this before and have done similar things with exes. People move on, I moved on etc.The important part is just to not repeat it over and over again. But that’s all u can do now!

My baby sister always asked why I have so many “lines” on my arms, that was my excuse until she got a bit older.

raisedbynarcissists,f8aomem,t3_dzujeu,1574404525.0,It seems like Nparents loose more empathy with age. My mom was always weird towards animals.. I  don’t get the need to be mean to animals. I’m really sorry about your dad that’s bs he did that..
raisedbynarcissists,f8ani38,t3_dzszr6,1574403226.0,"First step to changing it is realizing, and admitting / accepting it to yourself. Then it’s kind of a road which I’m still very much on of constantly correcting it, sometimes I go days weeks even months not correcting things, and honestly it helps to a certain degree after a while if u can do it. Anytime you can catch yourself (for me it’s so rooted it’s hard to catch myself at first and a lot now because I don’t even notice it it may be that way for you too) doing any of these things, acknowledge them, and even in ur head try and switch that behaviour, even if you don’t do it out word at first, you can try to do it in word, build up a little confidence or whatever strength you can and try to remember you are capable, you are enough as your own person, and try more and more. It’s hard as hell, it isn’t easy, because ur literally re programming yourself. 

But this is the only help I can give atm because I’m still on my journey and ... I don’t have much help or advice coming my way.. reddit has actually surprising been helpful tho and it may be for u as well. And as most people say u could try therapy- but make sure to find one who is very very educated and knows how to work with someone who’s had abusive parents, and narcissist parents, it’s not a subject all therapists can deal with unfortunately.

ptsd,f8a74rh,t3_dztbxk,1574389487.0,"Not wrong at all. There’s no difference. It’s your moms favouritism, and denial that make u feel like it’s wrong. Any normal healthy parent wouldn’t react in that way. Once I have kids, if I found out one molested the other, I honestly have no clue how I’d react but it would not be in that way... in fact I’d probably not want to talk to my son anymore.. as harsh as that may sound to some. Blood is just that, blood, it doesn’t mean you have to forgive or let people get away with things. It doesn’t make any difference. I don’t talk to any of my family apart for my dad and sisters because of similar things, and I had to get over the whole family thing a long time ago. I think other people.. like ur mom need to realize that as well. there’s much better ways to handle things. Ur not in the wrong. She is. I’m really sorry you went through that, that kind of betrayal.. abuse.. from family is the worst feeling ever."
raisedbynarcissists,f8987mr,t3_dzjgbe,1574368737.0,"My Nmom always went to that growing up.. if I dissociated from the abuse she’d accuse me of stealing her pills and getting high off them, when I’d have panic attacks and almost faint the whole time it would be her accusing me of stealing her pills.. it was weird.. keep in mind I was a little kid.. she’s delusional just like most Nparents.

Any reaction but full submission, full attention, obviously means there’s something wrong with you! How else could u not respond to ur own mother!? Lol it’s ridiculous."
ptsd,f87fbxm,t3_dz9ek5,1574330595.0,Omg I felt the same.. I love that series.. but I admit I had to skip certain parts. And it did trigger me.. definitely not something I’d watch if my ptsd was really bad that day/week whatever.
ptsd,f87dw76,t3_dzgh2e,1574328239.0,"I’ve tried both.
CBD never did anything for me, I assumed it was my stress level, even weed sometimes doesn’t seem to get me stoned on rly high stressful days no matter how much I smoke. It’s odd.
Weed has been really good for my cptsd though, and sleep, even my depression. It makes things kind of okay for the time being and helps with flashbacks, and that whole fight or flight response. even though it’s not addictive per say that feeling of things being ok can become addictive (at least in my experience and the people around me) and if you are prone to getting addicted to things, there’s a higher case of that happening (like for me). I smoked weed all day for a while, and it got too much and was bad, I couldn’t focus on anything and I relied on it like you wouldn’t believe (I was in a abusive relationship at the time) but now I only smoke at night to sleep, and it really does help. 
On the other hand Sativa makes my anxiety worse, I only smoke Indica, and also since u said weed is legal where u r as it is here u can ask the cashier about the best ones for ptsd / stress.. although I’ve heard of some actually saying sativa is better for anxiety.. weirdly enough...I wouldn’t listen to that but it’s good to experiment with what may work best for u personally. So yeah Indica is my go to. 


I’ve only ever known one person personally who weed gave anxiety / panic attacks to them. Everyone’s different. Some people just don’t even like it too. And as for paranoia that definitely can happen.. although It makes my paranoia calm down. I get really paranoid especially at night, and during psychotic episodes it has calmed me right down, which is odd to people I’ve told for some reason lol.
In the end though weed is harmless just don’t over smoke and buy the right strains and if it doesn’t help it’s no big deal."
ptsd,f80j7mc,t3_dy3w0c,1574130337.0,"Totally. It sucks - it seems sexual abuse or any other type of trauma apart for military / war type trauma, is looked down on, belittled, made fun of, or made light of. The stories I have found seem to be like oh I admitted I was r*ped, accepted it and then bam I was cured. It’s very discouraging. I wish there was more light on these subjects. It’s good ptsd for people in the military is well known though don’t get me wrong, but it is discouraging at times."

That was real?? Mom always told me that my memories of that were fake” it’s sad/funny uncovering the smallest of things that paint such a huge picture.
