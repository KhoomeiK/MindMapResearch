Why? Because you simply cannot trust politicians to uphold the will of their state/constituency, they prefer to push their own legislation over the will of the people. Historically, good monarchs (of which it is not hard to come by) always take the views of their people as if it were to word of God, and as such it is my belief that a constitutionally democratic monarchy, as I call it, is the best way to go. No need to vote for people, just policies."
