simpleliving,fpz0um9,t3_gfvzlk,1589011435.0,"Because i'm not coming back from where i came from. Also because my goal isn't just success my goal now is self actualisation - to be the best business woman, best daughter, best mother, best whatever i can be. To max out who I am. It's not about being a perfectionist but knowing i've completely exhausted that avenue. ie. I've made the max money -there's no more money for me to make in my life time :P

And getting as much money as possible because money = freedom via resources to me. I want my freedom.  Freedom makes me happy. More money = i'm more happy. It's really that simple for me.

\+ i follow lil duval's richbroke lifestyle. my money stays in the bank lol, i live the frugal life with you. i just like knowing i have it. i work to be rich not look rich.

I see a culture of complacency, yes a rat race, but people just get to a certain level and give up so my race is against a culture that wants me to be barefoot and pregnant at home, give up all control of my life to my husband and family therefore increasing my venerability when it doesn't need to be increased. My race is against a culture that puts glass ceilings up for women and put them in boxes. That's my personal fight. That's why i'm not satisfied

also my father's perspective - and he was really in the rat race too - was 'if you want to help poor people, don't be one of them' and he really did it. made his money and helped loads of people.

ALSO! look, i'd never be having conversations like your friend had with you because it's so insensitive. you have the right to be miffed. omg i can't believe he thought talking to you about this is okay :S"

Spells,fpnfubo,t3_geclbg,1588761439.0,"the ones that go wrong all have one thing in common - it wasn't really a love spell it was a domination and mind control spell.

you don't have the right to make that one person fall in love with you. that's abusive, gaslighting, controlling, manipulative - all forms of toxic. and this is coming from someone who has no problems with bane magic.

facts are - most people who go hunting for love spells fall into this category.

\--------

however - what you actually able to do and folks have been doing with no issues and with good results are loves spells like new love where you say 'i'm looking for a relationship like \_\_\_\_' or 'i'm looking for a partner that is \_\_\_\_\_\_'  - emphasis on points like 'we are BOTH happy and fulfilled in the relationship' 'we are BOTH treated with respect etc '

why this is fine is because you don't have a specific person in mine, you're just looking for love, here are your standards and what you're looking for, and you leave it up to the higher power to arrange it for you.

\------

if \^ that doesn't work ie. you meet someone that fits your description and you get the ""ick"" - then you're looking at a situation where you maybe too young so don't really know what you want and you need to do self work and self discovery to sort that out."

Spells,foxsid0,t3_ga6mvc,1588154750.0,"here's a copy and paste on a different question that was basically asking the same question:

&#x200B;

i think you need to break this down to the components to tackle

1. obsession itself - this does need to be cooled down
2. regrets about the past - so some work on forgiving yourself
3. him and his new gf - fomo? lost opportunities
4. maybe clarity because maybe this is all stemming from loneliness (bc quarantine) and not cause he's actually a catch?

so you may need to do multiple spells over a course of time to help yourself out. good thing is is that most of it can double up as self-care/therapeutic spell work for yourself that can help you out in the long run

i think you need to focus on these 4 components before doing a cord cutting because imo, cord cutting without processing first kinda just makes you feel abandoned in the process. there are exceptions to this of course.

i recommend - maybe look at repurposing a freezer jar spell but put in there your circular thinking, non stop thinking - obsession, put in some botanicals like rosemary, camphor, orange peels, sage to also bring clarity to why you're obsessive in the first place. this can hopefully help cool down your emotions too

maybe a different spell for forgiving yourself for what has all happened and this subreddit has a lot of self love jars that you can use and search up forgiveness botanicals and put forgiveness on the petition. this can be put somewhere and worked for a long time for continuous benefits

as for the lost opportunities bit, i'm not sure, but everything in life comes with missed opportunity it's literally called 'opportunity cost' so maybe you need to switch it up to greater faith that something better is coming for you. faith in the future is so huge for moving on. crucial.

write down all you learned and how learning gall of this has changed you for the better, and maybe cut the cord here, as you're cutting say something like 'despite the opportunities we have lost with one another and how sad i am to see you go, i cut this cord now because i'm putting my foot down - you need to go your own way and i need to go my own way. may we never cross paths ever again'

witchcraft,foit9pd,t3_g7njpa,1587796283.0,"so i think your auntie left out some vital information:

the spell your aunt told you is generally called a freezer spell, there's a lot online about these.. what she didn't tell you is that it's for a certain type of wish not just any -  it for if you 'wish' to take someone out of your life  or to 'wish' freeze them so they can't move. i don't see how it'd work in bringing about your wish for your husband to be home with you, it may freeze him where he is. 

you have to think about the components of the spell and what the symbolism is. you want movement - so does freezing make sense?

I'm tired of seeing what represents me passive and passive and passive and even when they're not being passive they're definately  not as active as the men, in fact the only women who are as active as the men and as powerful in the bible have a negative twist on them. The side eyeing of Sarah with hagar and Ishmael, that other lady that got john the baptists head cut off, queen of sheba, Rebecca's manipulation so her other son gets the blessing instead of the one Jacob intended

emotionalneglect,foc8n4f,t1_foc6ijx,1587668392.0,"yeah i understand that concern , so i recommend keep it succinct

some reasons why i think i've been behaving like the way i do:

\-issues with my mother resulting in childhood emotional neglect

\-issues with communication

\-issue with anger

\-issue 4

what i'm doing to resolve these things:

\-therapy 

\-books including '----' for CEN

\-books including ' ----' on communication skills in relationships, in general life, something brene brown!!

\-meditation (for example)

\- anger - i am doing martial arts to work off the aggression, i'm working with a therapist to find healthy ways of expressing it, i'm learning about dragon breathing and other forms of breath work to work through this 

\-support groups (for example)

i'm doing the above to resolve these issues because even though i went through something it doesn't mean that i had the right to treat you the way i did. I recognise that i have even more responsibility now because i am now fully cognisant of the whole situation. I am ready and willing to bare this responsibility and do right by you, first and foremost, and for our future children (if you guys talked about it) and for our loved ones.

\--------------

don't think of it as a love letter that has to be sappy ... until the end!  at the beginning and middle - this is your proposal for a plan of action to fix these problem and acknowledge the situation and her hurt, and then at the end! last thing anyone wants in this situation is flowery words that results in no action, im sure you can understand

but still for the last paragraph really let her know how much you love her, how much she means to you, how much she deserves to have the love that she deserves.

but know that you have to do this work for yourself regardless of her reply. because she may decline a new relationship with you but that doesn't stop this work from being important. you deserve a fabulous relationship in your life. we all do"
emotionalneglect,fobtmh6,t3_g6q12w,1587663529.0,"i think, from being the girlfriend in this scenario and being yourself in another scenario what i would've really appreciated is an acknowledgement of what went wrong and what you did wrong - you don't need to be flowery but a letter with a sincere clear apology and writing in bullet points a list of issues you realise you committed and now acknowledge and are committed to changing. you acknowledge the pain you didn't mean to cause but did cause and explain it to her briefly but keep the focus on recovery, a brighter future and keep it 'us against the problem' focused instead of 'me vs you'.

do you want her back? if you do: ask to try again and right under that list out how it'll be different this time because she needs to know she won't walk back into the same situation

ie.  'We won't ever have our old relationship back again but I want to ask if you would be open to building a new relationship with me. Before you ask - this is what will be different:' - and list out how you will act differently or how you two will approach things differently. be honest that you will be working though alot of anger bc of the situation because she deserves to make an informed decision and make sure she gets that conversation shes been wanting

\^ that quote is from Ester Perel a world renown relationship therapist, she's got lots of Ted talks and books.

then you have the difficult task of making the change and proving to her the change and doing the work and i recommend looking in Ester Perel's work on infidelity- not for the cheating part but her work on the healing a relationship part. It's applicable to any situation where the relationship has broken down and/or trust is weak -  you have to actively check in with her and work to change and make sure she knows but she also has to do the work to let go of her resentment if she has any, any like 'hahaha i was right' if she has that and any pain that maybe stopping you guys from moving forward into your new relationship together

so i wonder if it's a more general 'scorpio season' thing with mars in scorpio's 12H causing the scorpio energy to be more wildin' or if it's a like 'earth sun' or 'air rising' kinda thing

hmm"

i was okay after a while but i've been miffed about eye contact since. thank you for your reply, generally i do follow that protocol but i kinda keep my eyes wide span on the entire face, and not directly look at the eyes, like i'll dart my eye contact to nose, forehead, cheeks, lips, hair and keep it moving .. avoiding the eyes

i hope that makes sense but it's probably because i don't want to be so invasive since i know (from above) it can feel like that. so i'm wondering should i just include the eyes into the protocol? like whilst they're talking, dart around the face but along with the smiling, nodding or other facial expressions to do that along with actually looking into their eyes?

i feel like i internalised the whole 'eyes are the window to the soul' and my mind thinks: 'oh gee, um, okay if so then like i don't want to go into their soul without their permission.. maybe i'll avoid that out of boundaries and respect..' hmm 

i don't know"

i know someone with cancer IC with jupiter there, trine mars in pisces  - he had no parents at all. like they were gone. empty house, abandoned. 

&#x200B;

the point i'm making is that astrology descriptions always seem to go to the extreme. and even you going 'saturn = difficult' is extreme. jupiter being automatically good = extreme. i've had some unfortunate events happen during supposedly 'good' transits with jupiter trining things

5 people were agreeing that i'm a pisces 'for sure' ... i've got a personal planet stellium in capricorn... however what's in pisces is my saturn which is the ruler of capricorn

&#x200B;

so the question was does saturn being in pisces cause my capricorn stellium to become more piscean because saturn rules capricorn?

&#x200B;

according to how people view me, i guess so, and after reading all the work describing pisces.. yeah i see it too; deffo more pisces than cap"
