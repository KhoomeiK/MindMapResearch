intj,foipdef,t3_g7iddq,1587792830.0,I’ve been with my boyfriend for 7 years and have never stopped second guessing. It doesn’t mean I don’t love him. It’s just who I am. We’ve both accepted that I’ll always be questioning. But reaffirming the answer those questions can be rewarding.
stimuluscheck,fofd75g,t1_fofcy8d,1587733173.0,Gotcha. Yeah I think my DD wasn’t already in the system because I owed and didn’t receive a refund. (Which makes no sense because they still have my bank account and routing # for ACH payments. So it’s the same information. But whatever)
stimuluscheck,fofctrx,t1_fofcqql,1587732913.0,Lol same. My jaw literally dropped when I saw I could finally enter my DD info

stimuluscheck,fof9pk5,t1_fo7hn16,1587730532.0,So do they just have one phone line open that they’re not telling people about? I thought lines were closed. How come someone is there to answer at all?

Edit: Just ordered the book! Can’t wait to read it."
intj,fo6l31c,t3_g5vkcw,1587561436.0,When people treat politicians like rockstars on tour. And when they have a one-sided interpretation of any news that paints their hero in a negative light. It’s really difficult for me to understand kind of undying devotion.
intj,fo6k3aa,t1_fo63c13,1587560768.0,"Same. I guess it was the teen hormones that prompted this shift. If not, maybe I should be concerned that I turned into a different person seemingly overnight right after puberty."
intj,fo6i6cy,t1_fo5rlwo,1587559426.0,Good point. I’m just disappointed that the writers couldn’t be more consistent with the plot and work it into the missions naturally.
intj,fo6hubw,t1_fo5yxdi,1587559181.0,"Yes! 100% agree. The mechanics of the story cutaways bothers the hell out of me too. It seems unnatural and forced.

stimuluscheck,fo4svap,t1_fo4sdms,1587510555.0,I get ya. At least we got some valuable info. Better than nothing.

Also, correct me if I’m wrong, but I remember Dave saying that after the initial “Christmas” bit, he started recounting the story of his brother’s death out loud. While doing so, the spirit box responded in real time to parts of the story (like park, etc.). So, I think it makes more sense to assume that whatever’s coming through on the spirit box is mimicking what he’s saying, not coming up with it on the fly. No?"

wyzecam,fcd0d2a,t1_fcd031u,1577604802.0,Thoughtful response. Thank you. I didn’t know about the legal time limit. Does it matter where customers are based?

wyzecam,fcczpta,t1_fccy9cc,1577604579.0,"How about email AND public announcement on social media? And you’re alone on the email thing. Most adults check email once a day, at least to skim.

From [r/IAmA/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/wiki/index):

>AMAs should NOT be about:  
>  
>Crowd Funding - AMA submitters that include crowdfunding campaign  links must be eligible for an AMA without the campaign for it to be  allowed. Additionally, the focus of the AMA must not be the campaign,  and the campaign must be fully funded. If the campaign has not reached  its goal, it is deemed an advertisement and will be removed. The final  decision on eligibility rests with the moderators. IAmA is not your  advertising platform.

&#x200B;

>If the crowdfunding campaign is still happening, you're probably not  ready. Your product needs to be complete and being sold to customers  before you're ready to do an AMA. That said, if you have previous  products or are an existing brand and you'd like to do an AMA about  those experiences, we will permit limited promotion of your new  crowdfunding campaign so long as it is not the focus of the AMA."
