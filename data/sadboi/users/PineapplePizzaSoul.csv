AskReddit,fmut51q,t3_fxd698,1586398309.0,"That i'm interested in law, my mom indoctrinate me so much with the idea of becoming a lawyer (her dream) so when i get in my ""rebellious phase"" i started hating everything that involves law but recently i started to get some interest in it (not enough to study it, but still) thanks to r/legaladvice. If i tell her that i have some interest in it she would get in her ""i'm the boss"" mode and will try to take my freedom of choose and guilt trip me into studyng law.

Also, that i'm going to change my name some day."
