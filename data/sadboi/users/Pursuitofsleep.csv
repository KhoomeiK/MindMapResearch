Coronavirus,fr0idep,t3_glougv,1589796751.0,"It is by far easier to marginalize those that have died of Corona Virus for many Americans. They were elderly. They were unhealthy. They had pre-existing conditions. This is just another way to see members of our community as ""the other"" and devalue their lives. 

In doing that it absolves those with guilt in their minds it's not their fault for not wearing a mask, wanting a hair cut, and not properly practicing social distancing. Many with large financial interests are also the first to mention these types of alienating rhetoric. Media outlets, politicians, large corporations, billionaire wackos that insist another week of loss from their manufacturing plant just isn't worth the human cost, and those near the top of the capitalist pyramid that claim there are more important things than living.

It's easy to forget 90,000 people when they are ""the other"" and not us. Especially when it can be blamed on the victims themselves by blaming their age or health instead of actually examining the inconvenienent facts at hand. Instead of dismissing the plight of the other and alienating those that have suffered and died we, as a country, need to turn that gaze inward and examine out shortcomings and why these people had to die, especially when it's positioned as a sacrifice for the economy or the nebulous future. 

I don't want a future built on the corpses of the sick, the frail, the aged, and those that have suffered because someone in power or privilege decided they they were expendable. Until we start treating the dead as us and valuable members of society then I'm afraid that's exactly what is occuring."

MarvelStrikeForce,fqtnamn,t3_gktz3y,1589642304.0,"There are people that might not know, but there IS A CAP on the amount of orbs you can receive from a node. 

I've always felt the only real proper use of cores in these type of events was energy and considered refreshing nodes as a sort or trap. By the end of an event I will typically cap out the rewards from several nodes forcing me to use the medium difficulty nodes anyway. It makes absolutely no sense why I would want to spend cores to hit that roadblock even faster. 

You really don't gain anything by refreshing those nodes except giving away valuable cores to hit a roadblock you will most likely hit anyway if you are buying every 50 core energy reload daily. 

On days when I complete all the hard nodes I simply move to the highest difficulty medium nodes and auto farm them. They have already been opened by unlocking the corresponding  hard nodes. I will only use ""extra"" energy on these medium difficulty nodes and I never purchase extra energy with cores to run these nodes, unless I'm desperately close to another star level on a character before war lock-in or something similar, but in nearly every case I don't believe it is worth it other wise. 

So to sum it up. NEVER pay for hard node refreshes since you'll use up all the rewards by the end of the event anyway. Once you complete all the hard nodes for the day move to the medium difficulty nodes, but DON'T spend cores in energy to run these. The main reason to even run them is so that you won't loose any extra energy as it naturally recharges over time and therefore optimizing cores/energy/and rewards."
MarvelStrikeForce,fqtcim9,t3_gkbj66,1589636067.0,"I feel the HUGE gap between completing DD2 and starting DD3. Gear 14 progression is just all around terrible due to mini-uniques and the inability to farm most pieces. All this is ok by me, I don't want it to be easy or fast. I want a sense of accomplishment as the struggle and time invested makes the payoff that much better. 

That being said, there is a massive gulf between completing DD2 and starting DD3. I'm 1 complwted piece away from my 1st G14, but 8ts been many months since I finished my 2nd run through of DD2. I just wish there was something as a bridge. Perhaps rerunning DD2, as grindy and horrific as that sounds, would be a great way to bridge this content. If the 3rd DD2 run provided a little more than a slightly upgraded character portrait frame that would go a long way to provide said content. If every battle gave out 2 to 4 g14 equipment drops and maybe 20 total for completing it than I'd be thrilled to run it again! And again. And again. And again. I'd get to use more of my roster, try different combinations and teams while slowly gaining progress. Just the smallest amount of rewards would really help as it would be equipment we could count on, even if there weren't many of them. The amounts could even drop between runs, perhaps providing only 1 or 2 pieces per battle and 10 to 15 for a complete run. 

This wouldn't ruin any sort of funds FoxNext would make from selling gear due to the small amount it would release into a players collection, it may even be able to increase sales of FoxNext made sales of 1, 2, or 3 pieces possible for a small and considerate price. Many people would get these rewards, be one or two of an item away and spend a buck or two in a heart beat. I think it would really be seen as a net positive in the community, as it is content that isn't required to re-run and a small enough amount of rewards where it wouldn't skew progression in a massive faction. Using monetization guidelines like I mentioned could mean it's a win for FoxNext as well as players. Surely there must a possibility in this idea or something similar as the benefits to both sides seem to outweigh any downsides if the amounts of gear rewarded are capped at low levels and prices of individual pieces are kept reasonable."

Fuck anyone who says what an ""adult"" is or isn't. That modality of thought literally discounts and makes light of all creative and imaginative professions. 

The only thing that the OP should be questioning is why they haven't started commiting their creations to a medium. Writing, painting, drawing, music, digital art, film, etc and so forth are all ways that you can develop these ideas and share them with others. Even if you choose not to share them with others (which would be a loss to the world as a whole) consider taking some of your ideas and cataloging them through one creative outlet or another. Feed your creativity and don't repress it for any reason. The individuals I've encountered that embrace their imagination and creativity are typically the most fulfilled and self actualized people it has been my pleasure to know. 

Don't let the Breakfast Club quote happen to you, ""When you grow up your heart dies.""

Who do you think Warner Media/Time Warner, one of the largest media conglomerates on the planet, want in office?   They want an administration that will bow to the interests of lobbyists and maintain the status quo. They want regulations further erased so they can further consolidate the media. Right now 6 companies own virtually every media outlet in the United States. All of those companies spend countless dollars per year to keep their stranglehold. From what you watch to how you watch it, they own it all. They have been able to restrict many areas to only one viable option for internet access and seek to gain further restrictions on competition. These companies won't stop until they own it all or someone stops them. Neither Biden or Trump will limit their power or control over the American consumer.

I'd really like to be able to read the piece, but in reality we will never know the real number. There have been piles of reports since the very beginning of the outbreak, from many countries, not reporting the true number of dead. Reports indicated doctoring of numbers such as patients that pass away from pneumonia or other respiratory distress that hadn't been tested yet aren't among those counted. You can listen to the leaders of many countries publicly speak about ""keeping the numbers"" low, so the idea of an accurate report of Covid-19 related deaths seems impossible. When leaders are desperate to suppress the number of cases and deaths in order to calm the populace and hedge financial losses then the public suffers by not knowing the true toll of the crisis. This also hurts the response to emerging cases and could limit the amount of aid some regions receive."

Boys and men can be victims, but receive next to no support traditionally. Please if you are a parent or caregiver, believe boys. Don't challenge their manhood or sexuality because of potential abuse. Urge them to contact the proper authorities and help them seek the counseling they need.

nottheonion,fkyacm4,t1_fkx7l4y,1584644788.0,"Exactly. Monica was written strong and relatable when she appeared. Honestly, how many Midwest American white kids first got introduced to a strong black woman that wielded immense power and never accepted to be anything less than equal to the men around her though Rambeau, or my personal queen, Storm. One of the other accolades I can attribute to Marvel comics of that particular time period was how characters weren't racially homogenized. Monica and Ororo were both completely different from each other and didn't suffer from simply being a cookie cutter representation of racial stereotypes. Both were, at one time, leaders of the most power (and best selling) super hero teams at Marvel. 

Characters in current day Marvel books can certainly miss the mark. While the characterization of Ms Marvel, for instance, has been great at many points, others have suffered from being nothing but an odd stereotypical shell. 

Ironheart immediately comes to mind. During her first appearances between Iron Man and Champions there was little to no cohesion. I never felt she was written as a human being or an actual character first. Instead she was sassy black teenager that's good at the science. There was rarely, if ever, a unified voice of the character until further creative teams took the reigns, but by then I was already completely disinterested. She needlessly suffered from a constantly shifting personality that made her seem like a sociopath rather than something that fans could relate to or feel a kinship towards.

I'm sorry but sassy black teenager, non-binary person of indescript color, and street wise gay latinx aren't character starting points. Creations that start at these types of stereotypical characterization rarely ever achieve relatability and, therefore, any measure of success. Starting from these points just doesn't yield well developed characters. If Marvel wants to create a non-binary hero perhaps they could try to develop one whos primary characteristics aren't their race or sexuality. 

Think of an actual person you know. Someone you are friends with, a family member, or a co-worker. Think about why you like that person. Think about what makes them well, you know, THEM. Are they bookish? Outgoing? A natural leader? Or are they more quiet and reserved? Are they a mysterious outsider that guards themselves from others? What motivates them, is it a call for justice or a trauma that molded them into a cape wearing hero, hand stroking  villian, or perhaps something in between? Then once an image of a real person starts to come together decide on race and sexuality, but not as mere add-ons stapled to the character bio. Race and sexuality also influence all these other traits. Was their trauma due to being a victim of racial or sexual violence? Is their heroic or villainous persona motivated by a quest for justice or revenge due to who they are? Do they even show the people closest to them their true selves or are their sexuality and superpowers closeted? I feel these are the starting points to build something memorable, relatable, and non-offensive to an audience. Race and sexuality just aren't the basis for good character, they are but parts of the whole that relate to all the other facets of their life and personality. 

Not only do these terrible designs for Snowflake and Safespace miss the mark, but then Marvel decides to shout ""look at our non-binary person of color."" As if that isn't bad enough to use these characteristics as a promotional tag, then a whole group of writers, artists, letterers, colorists, and editors saw this ""ironic"" hackneyed use of pejorative language as names for characters. It's just baffling that no one said, hey wait a second this is a terribly insulting idea that won't land with hard core readers, casual fans, or perspective new customers, but instead belittles the very people it seeks to represent.

When I think of Storm, I think of a strong woman and brilliant leader that can teach a class of young people struggling to find their place in the world just as well as she can wield god-like powers over the elements. I think of how her youth as a pickpocket living on the streets of Cairo influenced her life by giving her survival skills and the will to succeed in the face of insurmountable odds. I think of how she was seen as a goddess because of the power she wields, but instead of that corrupting her completely the influence of her surrogate X-Men family and Xavier in particular has helped her cultivate an air of grace, composure, and confidence. I think of her as a woman with a love life that has evolved over the years with partners like Forge, Wolverine, and Black Panther. Ororo was never subservient or anything less than an equal to her romantic partners even though some of them are amongst Marvel's most recognizable heroes. Her speech and inflection are unique and, when written correctly, has a tinge of her African roots. It's apparent in her speech or thoughts without sounding like a bad actor attempting an accent they've never actually heard. Storm challenging Callisto for leadership of the Morlocks is a great example of when all of these different traits come together in excellent writing that portrays all these different facets of a characters personality, their motivations, and their unique world view.

Snowflake, on the other hand, is starting out as non-binary person of color that makes snowflake like things with their powers and chose a pejorative as their name at a misguided attempt to own a term no one would really want to own.
The differences are pretty clear to me. Maybe the creative team can pull off turning Snowflake and Safe space into actually relatable characters and I'll reserve my final judgement until reading the first issue. As of now the characters are starting with a near insurmountable handicap that seems impossible to break free of because they seem more like a bad joke than actual characters. It's going to be a real shame that this will be the legacy of non-binary representation starting to appear in Marvel comics."
nottheonion,fkwkkh2,t3_fkxc8d,1584595387.0,"Another destined to fail Marvel comic and more ammunition for the ""get woke go broke"" crowd to make hateful videos on. You'd think both sides would be tired of this by now. 
One would think Marvel would like to connect with an audience to boost their horrific sales numbers, but poor design like this is insulting to all sides quite honestly. I can't think of anyone that would look at this and see a great idea in the making. It's off-putting and just strange.

If Marvel wants to connect to an audience, this ain't it chief. Marvel used to bank on relatable characters that it's audience could vicariously see themselves as, and there was room for everyone! Gay, straight, black, white, native cultures, city girls, country boys, and anything you could think of in-between used to be represented in Marvel comics. The 70s and 80s in Marvel comics were absurdly representative from many writers and artists in their bullpen when much wider acceptance was yet to come in most social circles. (Marvel did have its fair share of poor representations then as well, like how nearly every black character spoke only in jive for many years) Even when editorial said no, many creators still integrated these representations into their works. John Byrne coding Northstar as gay even though he was explicitly told not to comes to mind.

The current Marvel comics turns everything into some twitter-esque racial or sexual stereotype. Instead of creating actual non-binary characters with real personalities and identities readers are presented with this, this, whatever this is. Instead of beating readers over the head with dyed hair and what they thought were tongue in cheek code names they should have built actual characters instead of  neon stereotypes.

Sure superhero comic books are supposed to be a little out there, but many fans preferred Marvel published books because their heroes were typically ordinary people that found themselves in extraordinary positions or suddenly faced with overwhelming powers. This made the material relatable. It's the reason characters like the X-Men were so popular. Even if all the characters weren't exactly like the majority of readers they weren't necessarily written as the other or something alien. These depictions took the outrageous, over the top nature of super heroes and made them something that could tackle concepts like racism, sexism, abuse, disability, and so many others with a relatable realism. 

Maybe I'm wrong, but when I see this and hear the concept I just see another instance where readers won't relate to the material and the hateful in the community will use it as an outcry to further exclude and harass marginalized groups. I really hate that because there are great stories out there to be told about every kind of hero. Stories that some kid will see and say, ""wow, that character is kinda like me."" I just see this and think that a reader might feel like they are being made fun of or reduced to a stereotype. Maybe I'm wrong. I hope I am, but I just can't see this any other way with what has been released so far. It seems lazy, and uninspired. 

Reading the creators thoughts that these names were empowering proves that they just don't get it. If the naming conventions and design can be this insulting to a community I almost hate to imagine how they will be written. Hopefully it's not clueless writers looking at tweets and memes thinking, oh I understand and can write this community. Perhaps in their possibly good intentions they accidentally created something that feels more like a tongue in cheek, snarky parody of real marginalized people. The idea that the creators thought this was clever should be signal enough that they missed the target all together. I applaud the inclusion of every type of person as a hero, but first they need to feel like a person rather than the caricature of a race or sexuality. Don't make them a non-binary person of color that's a superhero, instead make them a relatable superhero that just happens to be a non-binary person of color."

You may say that the ruling powers have claimed testing is free. Sure, that may be the narrative, but it is still impossible in many areas to get a test.
Even if tests are ""free"" that doesn't mean the doctor or hospital visit to get that test is necessarily free.

You may say drive up tests are being set up to address that, but I've yet to see or hear of one in my area. Even if they were actually being set up they wouldn't come close to covering all Americans, much less those who need testing the most. It may come as a shock to some, but much of the population can't afford to own a car or can't drive due to a disability or advanced age.

Even if door to door testing were implemented there simply aren't enough boots on the ground to perform said tests in any sort of efficient or timely manner. This method also brings up many of the issues faced with this year's census by not being able to access individuals and communities that don't have access to steady housing or immigrant populations fearful of deportation.

Amazing solutions and implementation like this Italian town's complete testing of its community highlight how the American health system is beyond broken. It fails the people that need access the most. There are no short term answers of fixes. Sticking another finger in the dam won't stop the coming flood.

The following was a reply I posted earlier that sums up my opinion on this matter and offers some links to dive into the worrisome associations between Clinton, the DNC, and the developer of the app that has robbed Sanders of the bounce he would have gotten from a decisive win in Iowa. I was asked to ""prove it"" when I suggested that this Iowa mess was designed hurt the Sanders campaign.

I make my assumption based on the undermining of the Sanders campaign during the 2016 election cycle and the shocking revelations in just the last few days of anti-Sanders activity designed to undermine his candidacy. In the last week John Kerry was overheard  discussing entering the race if Bernie were seem likely to clinch the nomination. ( [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/john-kerry-overheard-discussing-possible-2020-bid-amid-concern-sanders-n1128476](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/john-kerry-overheard-discussing-possible-2020-bid-amid-concern-sanders-n1128476) ) The Democratic super PAC Democratic Majority for Israel began airing anti-Sanders ads a week prior to the caucuses as one example of attacks from within the party, but there have been many more. A quick google search will easily lead you to some of that information, but here is the link concerning that super PAC in particular. ( [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-attack-ads.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-attack-ads.html) ) 

&#x200B;

There was also the bizarre, but notable comments by Hillary Clinton in the last several weeks publicly attacking Sanders and even go so far as blaming Senator Sanders for her loss to Donald Trump in 2016. Clinton's strange revisionist comments can be found here and are important to consider in this narrative. ( [https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/constantly-attacking-me-hillary-clinton-blames-2016-loss-on-bernie-sanders-supporters](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/constantly-attacking-me-hillary-clinton-blames-2016-loss-on-bernie-sanders-supporters) )

&#x200B;

Those are both evidence of backroom pressure from within the party, but the main cause for concern was the revelation of the DNC email server hack and WikiLeaks dump during the last election cycle. The evidence against the DNC actively trying to hinder the Sanders campaign was so damning that DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz even resigned after the information was made public. There were coordinated attacks on the Sanders campaign coming directly from the upper echelon of the DNC, proving their image of impartiality was nothing but a farce and that they sought to influence the 2016 primary cycle instead of letting democracy run its course. If you aren't familiar with the scandal here is a great place to start ( [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/damaging-emails-dnc-wikileaks-dump/story?id=40852448](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/damaging-emails-dnc-wikileaks-dump/story?id=40852448) )

&#x200B;

Now we get to the Iowa caucuses. Sanders enters the contest a favorite to win and with a win there has historically been a bounce to that candidate's polling numbers as well as the all important fundraising influx that comes with a decisive early win. This years Iowa caucuses have lacked a clear winner due to widely reported failures and issues with the smart phone app that was developed for use in reporting the results. This app was developed by tech firm Shadow, which is owned by Acronym. Shadow is headed by Gerard Niemira, who worked for Clinton on her 2016 presidential campaign. You know, the one she blames Senator Sanders for loosing. Here is an article concerning the app used at the caucus and Mr. Niemira. ( [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/iowa-caucus-app-shadow\_n\_5e390191c5b687dacc722824](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/iowa-caucus-app-shadow_n_5e390191c5b687dacc722824) )

&#x200B;

It also just so happens that Shadow has accepted money from the Biden and Buttigieg campaigns for text messaging and ""software right and subscriptions"" as stated in the following article that goes on to explain the links between the company, former Clinton campaign members, and how those Clinton campaign members were nominated to the upper echelon of DNC leadership offices during the last time elections were held for control of the party, which also saw Sanders supporters snubbed out of the consideration.

SWGalaxyOfHeroes,fdyec3r,t3_en7h2q,1578778830.0,"Your post takes me back by reminding me of how I got started playing SWGOH in the first place. A few Holiday seasons ago (October through December of 2017) there was a limited time offer to get up to a 7 star Scavenger Rey and a ton of crystals and credits with the purchase of Google play cards. Essentially, as best as I can remember, the deal was AMAZING, which I'll try to recall a tad further down. (I found and included a link to the information at the end)

I had never played SWGOH before, but was a huge Star Wars fan, having grown up with the original trilogy movies and enough action figures to fill up 2 plastic Darth Vader heads and 1 plastic C3-P0 head with as many figures in each slot as would fit. 4 decades later I'm still mad at Rancor Keeper's fat man tits taking up a whole slot while I could fit 3 Bespin Lukes in the same slot. I'm also sure this sounds insane to anyone that doesn't understand what in the hell I'm talking about, so back to the actual game and not a formerly small child's decades old frustrations about chunky characters with man boobs taking up all the space inside the hollowed out skull of another character used a a carrying case. 

Anyway, I was an avid player of Marvel Future Fight and was in the position to whale out in that game. I figured I'd give SWGOH a try since I had all of these rewards just pilling up from my uncontrolled spending in MFF. The offer was Google Play cards cards under $25 got you 4-Star Scavenger Rey and 750 Crystals. Cards $25-$49.99 gave you a 5-Star Scavenger Rey and 1500 Crystals. Play Cards of $50+ resulted in 7-Star Scavenger Rey and 3000 Crystals. That isn't all though. Each one of these offers also gave out credits, and I mean a ton of credits. I remembered having millions when I first started. Also each level of card could be redeemed multiple times and once you completed a 7 star Scavenger Rey you would just get shard shop currency and bonus credits, as I remember. 

Since I enjoyed SWGOH from the start and knew the offer was repeatable, I went and got Play cards at every possible denomination to their max number of redemption attempts. MFF had just dropped the Thor Ragnarok update introducing CTPs, which were very rare and almost strictly pay to play at introduction so the Play cards were easy to justify in my mind (Because I was sick and had a problem. I'm now happily F2P in all mobile games) Even after I hit that threshold an email into EA customer service still gave out the proper awards for that particular level as a ""one time"" courtesy that definitely worked more than one time.

EA's deal definitely worked on me. At the lowest denomination, offering almost $7.00 worth of crystals, 80 shards, and some credits on top of the $5 face value of the card I got to use on another game was just too good to pass up. The same was true for $50 or $100 Play Cards that yielded almost $25 worth of crystals and a whopping 330 shards. If I remember correctly, I believe I was able to redeem 3 each of the highest 2 denominations and many more of the lesser cards. I do remember I was able to almost have a 7 star General Grievous to go with my 7 star Rey, but stopped just short of finishing him because I learned a bit too late just how bad he sucked prior to the reworks. That should give you all some indication of just how many times I was able to redeem the Play cards of smaller values. Buying Grievous through shard shop credits was a herculean task. If only I had better game knowledge at the time I could have bank rolled stun guns and carbonti, but at least Grievous ended up paying off in the long run.

All in all the offer did make starting the game much easier and kept me coming back. There was no other way I could have started playing 2 years into the game's life cycle and really feel like it was possible to catch up to other players if this hadn't been offered. Having a 7 star Scavenger Rey at the very beginning of the game let me breeze through early content and insured that the establishment of the sunken cost fallacy was present from the very start of the game. Thanks for posting that Battlefront promotion and reminding me of the offer which got me started in the game. It allowed me to dive into this little rabbit hole for a bit and stir up those feelings of regret when I am reminded of how much I used to spend in mobile games. Below is a link to the offer I was discussing.

Once again we are reminded why rules exist and should be enforced. Below is an interesting link from mid December 2019 showing that outrageous per night fee I mentioned earlier. That's right, $6,179 for a non-presidential suite, average room at Trump's Washington DC hotel. Fear not though, this near $7,000 for a one night stay actually gets you an automatic invitation to the White House and direct access to Pence and Trump.
