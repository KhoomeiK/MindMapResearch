bipolar,et4veht,t1_et4tm64,1562458304.0,I fell in love with how ants take their dead to a kitchen midden as a cemetery but not for the purpose I like to think they do lol
bipolar,et4t0nu,t3_c9ugc3,1562456877.0,These are nice. My favorite is the top right one. Glad you let loose and created something with the moment.

Existentialism,et4kk85,t3_c9sm1i,1562451855.0,Natuturally it reminds me of the throwness and projection of Heidegger. Sartre picked that up and I think is easier to relate to honestly. I like what follows with Heidegger that sometimes a good projection is to get stranded. Where you can hold off on the dice for awhile and maybe gamble with more reliance.
Needafriend,et4k4uu,t1_et1lc8v,1562451632.0,Things are moderate lol. Growing among frustrations. Mostly reading a lot and dwelling lol.
bipolar,et1h0fu,t3_c9mcsq,1562397225.0,Really like the cosmic aestetic. Well done.
horrormoviecollectors,et1gfkq,t3_c9eais,1562396971.0,These are great ones. Been reading a lot of Barker.
yandere,et175xa,t3_c9q642,1562392838.0,"Won't matter. I have a razor blade tucked under my wrist watch for this very occasion. When she leaves the room I cut the rope as quietly as possible, make a rope out of the bed sheets , and escape out the window. I already have a plane ticket I bought just in case and take a flight to Florida where I have a second family waiting for me."
bipolar,et135vb,t3_c9pdfy,1562391022.0,The right diet and just taking walks and maybe just letting your mind stroll could help but I'd think about this. Are the positives worthe the negatives. Could be worth it if it helps and not to worry so much about the weight.
AskRedditAfterDark,et0xg88,t3_c9pi6s,1562388567.0,A time quake once actually. Everything came undone and I ended up marrying my great grandmother by mistake so now I don't show up to family reunions no more.
AskRedditAfterDark,et0wzjj,t3_c9pid0,1562388340.0,Arctic expedition. Clown died tripping into a UFO crash landing site. Tasted funny.
penpals,erwqfe1,t3_c4e7n7,1561352203.0,"I'm Matt. I'm sitting in a messy kitchen with cows on the wall paper, aside me...asiago bagels and some margarine. My birthday gift, the rice cooker. I'm here, on the rocking chair with the cushion that slides off. Directly in front of me, two strange relatives from the forties??? Old photograph. In the darkness, the filter of a fish tank."
Existentialism,erwktc4,t3_c42sy1,1561346669.0,Was just thinking of getting back to this book. A good one for when you are not feeling great honestly.
TooAfraidToAsk,eoxa632,t3_btebfu,1558921136.0,I do feel a kind of existential angst just thinking about all the opportunities that are gone now. When you get older you start making choices that extend longer and longer. I think it takes a lot of work to make peace with that. I'm not really there yet.
