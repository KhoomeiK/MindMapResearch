Don’t get me wrong they are SUCH a talented team, but I think they limited themselves by having all of their Batman stories take place in a single night. Having the opportunity to let things breathe a bit more and have the Batfam interact in the cave or have certain duos go out for specific missions would have been so, so satisfying.

Rocksteady nailed what they set out to do, but as a fan, my brain cannot help but think of all the possibilities. I hope another studio uses the same attention to detail and world building to create a Batfam game in my life time."

I’m really sorry to hear you’re going through this, what you described sounds overwhelming for anybody. 

It sounds like your boxing team is a source of comfort, is there a way you can keep in touch with some of those people? Video calls and such?

I would also suggest that you continue exercising and try to work different parts of your brain creatively while you get through what sounds like a very difficult day-to-day. If you can muster the energy to try drawing, reading, or another creative endeavor, it might help in seeing that there are still plenty of enjoyable things in life even though you’re currently dealing with the loss of some other things. 

Lastly, I’ve heard that some people are still able to interact with their therapists through virtual communication. I would encourage you to reach out to your therapist if you haven’t already and see if that’s a possibility. If not, perhaps another mental health professional.

You are still so, so young and have so much time to heal and pursue your goals. You seem incredibly resourceful and tenacious, and those qualities can continue to serve you well while moving forward.

Best of luck."

It also sounds like you tend to dismiss your problems as small annoyances/something you can easily get over, but if this is really something that bothers you and eats away at you, then it’s something worth looking into. 

It’s not easy, it’s gonna take a whole lot of time, but I encourage you to keep opening up to people who’s opinions you respect/people who you deem as really emotionally intelligent. If you feel like you may be burdening them, consider seeing a therapist for a couple sessions or more.
