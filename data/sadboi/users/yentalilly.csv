FuckRodney,fo8bd95,t1_fo7t6dj,1587593337.0,My Able Sisters shop! I believe it’s in my catalogue if you want to figure out a way for me to get it to you
AnimalCrossing,fnzhysm,t1_fnyoj5i,1587394429.0,What happened was I caught a lot of sea basses and red snappers and ended up swapping them out for better fish. I didn’t stock up twice I just technically filled my inventory more than once
nintendo,fnuxpq9,t3_g3ptch,1587273950.0,Something positive? Being stuck at home for the past month has made me realize that all the work I’ve done in therapy to better myself has paid off. I am comfortable in my own mind and I like it here.
AnimalCrossing,fnrgadb,t1_fnr7msl,1587188069.0,Yup! It’s obnoxious. The only way to get something else to spawn is to catch the mole crickets. You can scare away the beetles and roaches but not the damn mole crickets. They’re little devils!!
AnimalCrossing,fnr3ygm,t1_fnr2kqk,1587178718.0,"I was having the same issue, and then randomly Isabelle announced someone (whom I didn’t choose) was moving in. Maybe we just can’t pick the last villager?"
AnimalCrossing,fnr3t8t,t1_fnr33dg,1587178618.0,Nope...the mole crickets are also one of the only things that can spawn (besides tarantulas) on an empty island. Same thing happened to me yesterday. I had dug up nearly the entire island in frustration. The mole crickets ruined tarantula island
CleaningTips,fmeq6nw,t1_fmdrjxy,1586010993.0,I second this. Hair dryer with an extension cord (if the dryer will allow it. Idk about electrical things) and go spot by spot and hold it over on the highest heat setting. It’ll disappear like magic
DoggyDNA,fm2k1m9,t1_fm14q9c,1585699055.0,"Yes, I just wasn’t sure how to post an update that would link back to this post. Results were 12.5% beagle, 12.5% Labrador retriever, 12.5% bulldog, and the rest was “breed groups.” I’m a little disappointed to be honest...it’s a high price to pay for such a large “unknown”"
Anxiety,fl2761v,t1_fl1z8oi,1584744454.0,"Yup to all of this. I went to doctor after doctor thinking something had to be wrong, only to me diagnosed with “functional abdominal pain.” So...IBS. I try to manage my anxiety as best as I can, but it’s gotten to the point where my IBS gives me anxiety and in turn...ya know. It’s an incredibly vicious cycle and it’s hard to imagine ever feeling normal again."
AskWomen,fkjdluw,t3_fiiox5,1584242896.0,"This may differ from the actual question that was asked, but I lost my high-school ex-boyfriend 4 years ago. I always had this feeling that we would ultimately end up together in the end, we talked on and off and his family felt the same way. I not only had to cope with the loss of a wonderful friend, but also grieve the loss of what I thought my future was going to be. I also had to cope with the fact that my childhood now almost seems...not real."
AskWomen,fkc8ed9,t3_fhfbti,1584047830.0,"I am extremely nervous about this. I live in an area where the number of affected individuals is rising, people I know are being told to work from home, and my college is extending spring break and moving to remote instruction. 

I’m a bartender. My job is essentially touching things that people have put in their mouths. I can’t even get a cover at work when I need it regardless. I don’t know what to do."
DoggyDNA,fkc7vxw,t1_fk64chd,1584047535.0,What a cutie!
DoggyDNA,fjcegwq,t1_fjalsgb,1583217025.0,I’d love to see a picture!!
tipofmytongue,fj92jq6,t3_fc7eh8,1583129745.0,"I vaguely remember this from a British lit class I took a few years ago. Could it be To His Love by Ivor Gurney?

tipofmytongue,ffb33sk,t1_ffb2ucn,1579750563.0,Solved!! Thanks so much!
tipofmytongue,ffb29kx,t3_esnatn,1579749978.0,"Any help would be appreciated. I remember it specifically being that every single word rhymed with one another, but I may be incorrect on that. Thanks in advance!"
AmItheAsshole,fdd4uuy,t3_ekkixp,1578294872.0,"Hi, licensed hairdresser here. NAH. While she may not be licensed, she still went through all of the training. I don’t know where you live, but the 10 month program I went through here in the US cost me $18,000. Shit’s expensive. The pricing should definitely have been decided beforehand, though. These types of things always become tricky with friends."
AmItheAsshole,fc3bkhn,t3_efwmzz,1577386163.0,"YTA. From someone who works in the industry, you’re there until the customer leaves. Doesn’t matter what’s going on or what day it is, you are stuck there til they leave. Her hoping to close at 5pm was just that, a hope, and you were calling her incessantly while she was trying to make some more money. Also, females close down the bar all the time. Pregnant or not, she’s capable, and drunkards and creepy people are typical in the business."
AmItheAsshole,f93t3lb,t3_e3mg85,1575067798.0,"YTA. What you did was illegal, and also disgusting."
AmItheAsshole,f72oamo,t3_du19w9,1573371362.0,"Server/bartender here, NTA. You have every right to go into a restaurant and order whatever you want, just know that you may be annoying your server by taking up prime real estate in a restaurant on a busy weekend night. If you wanna avoid any rudeness, you most likely won’t get it at the bar. The bar is a more “acceptable” place to just have an app and/or a shared meal. With that being said, you still aren’t doing anything wrong by sitting at a table, but you are unintentionally taking some money out of your servers pocket."
AmItheAsshole,f2vzinr,t1_f2u4dua,1570459393.0,I have personally smelled the state in which the bathroom is left. I don’t mean to be offensive but it just smelled extremely musty and unclean. Another redditor mentioned a book and gave me a link to a chapter on this topic specifically and I gave it a read and sort of put it all into perspective for me.
AmItheAsshole,f2u21sf,t1_f2th999,1570405340.0,Wow thanks so much! I’ll give it a read!
AmItheAsshole,f2syzh3,t3_ddzxjb,1570388709.0,"NTA. Your partner doesn’t have to go everywhere with you. You knew she wouldn’t like it, and honestly she didn’t have to go, you’re allowed to do stuff alone. I get why she’s upset and I probably would’ve been in her situation as well, but looking at it from an outside perspective, NTA"
AmItheAsshole,f2sndvo,t1_f2sm2gr,1570385219.0,"I am definitely going to pick this book up. I do my best 100% of the time to treat her with dignity as I would anyone else, and a common theme in the comments thus far has been to suggest slower times so she can do what she has to do. I think I’m going to go this route. I appreciate the honesty in your comment/judgement, I really do. I want to do the right thing by her as a person but also by my place of employment and this seems to be the best option"
AmItheAsshole,f2sluk0,t1_f2sl2o8,1570384626.0,"I’m not sure, it’s never been something I’ve had to think of before. The gist I’ve recurved from regulars who live around her was that she was married with kids and then her mental health declined and they say she wants to live this way? I really don’t know much besides what I’ve been told. I don’t want to ruin anything for her if it’s what she wants to be doing if that makes sense"
AmItheAsshole,f2sj4ch,t1_f2sgzkn,1570383579.0,This sounds like a great solution - thank you. It’s only tough this way cause she’s pretty nonverbal. You talk to her and she just looks at you - we’ve only ever had the her pointing at the bathroom and me saying of course go ahead interaction thus far
AmItheAsshole,f2sitk8,t1_f2sh5lh,1570383471.0,"You’re absolutely right. I said in another comment that my line of responsibility is blurred here so I’m always torn between making a decision on behalf of the business or just me as the bartender. Thank you for your insight though, I appreciate it. I’ll keep doing the right thing and figure out the best way to go about it that works for everyone"
AmItheAsshole,f2si5sh,t1_f2sh6ri,1570383275.0,"You’re absolutely right. The background on the situation with my bosses would be too long and quite frankly unnecessary for this situation, but to make matters short, there are only 4 FOH employees here and two cooks, so the front of house employees make the rules I guess? We can close if it’s slow/run specials if we feel like it, things like that. You’re right though, I can’t hire or fire anyone, I just know that I can’t go to them about a matter like this. They’ll just tell me to figure it out."
AmItheAsshole,f2shpyh,t1_f2sgx1u,1570383094.0,"I absolutely want to accommodate her. I feel awful, a lot of surrounding businesses have already stopped letting her because I guess she gets “carried away” with it - it’s just hard finding the balance of being a good person/also understanding that business is business"
AmItheAsshole,f2ry6sh,t3_de1yl0,1570377601.0,"NTA - but please go see a doctor. It’s a huge misconception that periods “hurt a little.” They are NOT supposed to hurt. What you’re describing, and I am not a doctor, sounds like endometriosis. I went through exactly what you did and had to plan my life around my period and no one deserves to live that way. Do your research on the condition and go into your dr appt knowledgeable. PM me if you have any questions, I had to become my own advocate and do a lot of the work myself to get answers."

pettyrevenge,eyie2cy,t1_eydboc3,1567101160.0,"No I absolutely wouldn’t cause I’m not an asshole lol, I’m not disagreeing the fact that the customer was a POS im just saying when you work in food service, especially as a bartender, you become liable for a lot of things. The bartender could’ve gotten in a lot of trouble if that guy got sick from something, whether it was rightfully his or not. Just saying to be careful with your petty revenge that’s all!"
pettyrevenge,eyd9ye0,t3_cwm0jq,1567014382.0,"This is hilarious, I’m a bartender, too and would’ve loved to fuck with people like this. However - be careful though. People order what they order for a reason, and although people are assholes, your petty revenge could be dangerous. I have celiac disease and if I were to take a shot of soy sauce I’d be pissed, sick for weeks, and end up in the hospital."
