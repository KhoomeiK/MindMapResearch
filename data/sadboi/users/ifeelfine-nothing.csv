antidepressants,feh2ls6,t3_ep43mh,1579107841.0,"Obviously, don't do those drugs. Yes, they're fun, bun not worth risking your mental health. LSD trips are dangerous without a clear head, and you probably can't afford to have your dopamine and serotonine depleted by MDMA now.

Concerning the interactions, though it's never recommended to mix serotonergics, both those combos don't seem to cause too much problems. The SSRI will however significantly weaken those drugs effects, to a point many people find this pointless. Taking a higher dose to compensate exposes you to more severe risks and side effects, on blood pressure for exemple.

If you're just starting an antidepressant you are probably at the beginning of a long journey toward finding the right dosage of the right combination of molecules that will work for you. This is a long process and you don't want to mess this up just to get high.

I won't make any recomandation but there are products that will not interact with your meds and with no significant risks of aggravating your condition. Party all you want but keep safe.

depression,fa5qkh7,t3_e7trv9,1575817510.0,"4 years in and I still haven't figured out how to talk about this yet. I think this deserve more discussion as it's one of the reason this illness isolates you so much. Here are some of the problematic reactions I noted.

\- I try to explain how this works, how things are difficult for me and people try to cheer my by saying things like ""don't say this, you're not like that, you know you're capable"" and so on, which are just minimizing my struggle and reinforcing my belief that no one can understand me. Yes depression destroys your self-esteem, but it also is truly debilitating and you don't fix this by making someone belive in oneself. In the same vein, people that try to cheer me by mentionning past achievements, or the few things I managed to do despite my depression.

\- Very broadly, people that contradict me when I try to explain them how this works (not everything is a debate...)

\- People that try to make me talk about it when I clearly don't want to.

\- People trying to explain you how I should deal with my problems, and apparently take it personnaly when I don't want to do things their way. Also, people that confuse someone needing help with someone needing a boss.

\- Comparisons, ""others have it worse"", some people seem to enjoy competing, ""I am/was more fucked up than you are"" basically. Ok, cool story bro.

\- Toxic positivity. People believing that depression is a mindset that people could change by simply looking at their lives another way.

\- ""It gets better"". I know not everyone hates that one - that's actually the only one that also concerns people who personnaly knew depression in my experience - but when you consider killing yourself on a regular basis, this has a whole different meaning. Depression is a chronic and potentially deadly decease and people shouldn't forget that.

\- People that try to take away the medical aspect of it. Okay, philosophy, lifestyle and all that are important things, but this is a mental illness. This one can take many forms, from pseudo-science and pop psych, to popular wisdom, to trying to make this a political/societal issue only, spirituality, bashing mainstream psychiatry and especially meds and so on. No, you're not less depressed because you are wiser than us...

\- People urging me to try things that work for themselves for problems that are not comparable at all. ""I was stressed at work too then I started yoga""

\- Finally something that a lot of people stop doing but shouldn't : talk about their own problems. This makes it reciprocal and helps a lot. Keep the previous points in mind though (don't boss, don't compete)."

depression,f7xtv1v,t3_dxyu1i,1574075182.0,"Suicidal thoughts can be so fucking paradoxical. I pretty much had a ""suicide kit"" by me at all time during a really rough phase when it was really hard not to give in to the temptation of ending it, and this soothed me rather than tempting me even more. Knowing that I could euthanize myself at any time if it becomes too unbearable helped me through my crisis.

On the other hand it's one of the reasons I was unnable to seek help. I anticipated questions about how exactly I considered killing me, leading to me obeying the therapist and getting rid of it, and ending up much more desperate."
depression_help,f7xt2q0,t3_dxnk02,1574074035.0,"It's really great that you were able to tell someone. This is huge, and you can be fuckin proud of that.

It's also normal that the depression replicates and makes you ruminate and regret it. It's an illness that's constantly whispering lies to you to keep you isolated and under its control. ""Maybe I shouldn’t burden people with my problems. I’ve always kept em to myself, why not now?"". That's not your thoughts. I know it feels like it and you believe them, but that's the depression talking, and it will be there for some time.

Now of course those lies are always based on some kind of truth. Maybe what you drunk-texted yesterday wasn't the the exact right thing to say. And yes, unfortunately, there is a good chance that your friend won't know how he's suppose to handle such a revelation and have reactions that will disapoint you. All these are very real possibilities. But keep in mind that with your conditions it's normal for such thing to be difficult, interactions will often be chaotic. But you nevertheless took one of the most important step toward getting better.

Right know you might feel desperate. What's the point ? It took me so much effort and courage and all I feel is regret and disapointment ? Pretty much any step you take in the right direction feels like that. That's depression.

But now that you took that first step, maybe your friends will try to adapt, probably with some clumsiness but they will try. And maybe that will make you feel just a bit more at ease, even if it's not perfect. And thene maybe you will find it less difficult to talk, or learn new ways to talk about this. And even though you feel bad about it now, you might have just broken depression's spiral of isolation and entered a vertuous circle of connecting with your friends.

It's huge that you try, and it's perfectly normal that it doesn't feel like a clear win at first.

Depression will capitalize on this to make you believe hurtful things. Don't fall in its trap, you're stronger than it and you just proved it."

Know that him being unnable to talk or needing time by himself is not a sign of reject or anything of the sort. He probably knows this upsets you but can't help it anyway. It's important to find the right distance. Being there, available, supportive and so on but giving him enough space at same time. Having to deal with other people's feelings and worries can be overwhelming when you are depressed, and even things as innocent as people asking for updates can be a huge pressure. Sometimes you can enter cycles of not being able to talk to your friends and family, feeling ashamed of it and thinking you need to excuse yourself for acting like that, making it even more difficult to talk and so on. So it's important not to take this too personnally. Maybe emotional support is not something he is ready for right know but you can help with more down to earth things. Cooking, cleaning, grocery shoping, administrative stuff. This kind of help too can be hard to accept - kinda shameful needing help for the most basic stuff, but, heh, sometimes you do need it- but maybe for him it will be less difficult, and could help him open up when the time comes.
