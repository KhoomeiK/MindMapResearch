Do NOT use soap on your bits, even outside. It can really disturb your normal pH level.

If you want, there are vagina washes like Vagisil which are friendly soaps.

I personally get a lot of smegma, so I have to thoroughly wash between my lips. It doesn't smell the nicest. But it's totally normal.

Also, chances are you have BV. You can easily get tested for it, and they'll give you antibiotics. It can come back though. In my personally experience, it didn't always smell ""like fish""."
