they block ""junk light"" which is blue light and other forms from electric light which is the MAIN thing that disturbs your melatonin production. the suns light is the primary trigger of our brain's sleep system. if you cant get a pair of these, try putting orange pillowcases over lamps or getting salt lamps and not using screens after sun down. i PROMISE it will help your brain's natural melatonin production. peace!"
