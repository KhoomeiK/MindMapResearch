I understand that some problems feel like they can never be fixed, but I’m still working on improving my sleep and crushing my procrastination issue nevertheless.

The point is, I could sit here with you all day, breaking down your problems to the smallest, most basic level. In the end, though, you will have to start somewhere and stick with it.

That’s the hardest part about depression. Suffering in silence, trying to claw your way out of this hole even when the light is an imperceptible speck in the distance. You may fall down to the bottom over and over again, you might find things that push you to climb a little harder, but you can never stop. I know for a fact that I don’t want to spend my entire life in this hole.

I know you have it in you. I don’t mean to sound like Walter White but you have to apply yourself. You have to keep climbing because unfortunately, that’s the only way out of this internal place."
depression,fqfuocu,t1_fqftoes,1589332040.0,"Well, take it from anyone who has undergone a major physical transformation: it’s a massive undertaking, there’s always plenty of false starts. Maybe find an exemplar on YouTube, an ordinary person who transformed their body and can provide you with advice on how to get started - maybe they even documented their progress. There’s a fair amount of research and preparation before you actually start working out, so you will have to commit to it. 


Completely changing your body is a difficult feat at the best of times and depression throws a hundred more hurdles in the way.


Maybe you should start with changing something smaller about yourself. That might mean improving your hygiene, getting a new haircut, working towards dropping a bad habit etc. 


Anything reasonable spring to mind?"
depression,fqfsrns,t1_fqfrbgk,1589330976.0,"That’s unfortunate but I’m glad you managed to overcome your family’s intolerance. 


I’m going to be blunt, it sounds like you have quite a lot of hatred for yourself. You call yourself an idiot and a coward in your post. 


I struggle with that too. Sometimes I wish I could be someone completely different, I wish I could’ve chosen who I wanted to be before I was thrown into this world. When you’re in such a bad place, it’s easy to give up and let yourself wither away as the years go by. This might mean withdrawing from social events, refusing to maintain hygiene and self-harming. I’ve been in that position and the only thing I could do was to slowly work on things about myself that I hated, such as my weight. It was slow, painstaking, but it provided some respite from the hours I would otherwise spending lying in bed and hating myself. Soon, I could look in the mirror and not be repulsed by what stared back at me. I had one less reason to hate myself.


Maybe it’s time to try and pick yourself up. You identified a problem that was ruining your happiness (gender dysphoria) and you went about trying to solve the problem (buying new clothes and make up, so you could feel a bit better about yourself). Could you apply this to other areas of your life?"

What about any group activities? Group meditation or yoga (or any activity of your choice)? It helps to know that you aren’t the only complete beginner and you don’t get discouraged so easily.

I’m guessing none of those things sound particularly inviting to you. It’s hard to pick up a hobby when you’re depressed but it isn’t impossible: these are all the things that I have started doing over the years and while my depression is definitely still there, I have ways of managing it."

I know this is a generic answer but the way you’re describing your situation, it sounds like you might need to seek help. You’ve done well by keeping yourself going all those years but that can only get you so far. It’s a huge leap, seeking professional help, but I think it might be the only thing that can take you from simply being “alive” to actually “living”.

We can’t tell the difference between being too weak and being strong enough to seek help. 


And I can’t even say with certainty that I’m not weak. I mean, my dad has braved the worst challenges life could throw at you and I feel like I’m expected to do the same. I was born to rich parents and have lived a perfect life, sheltered from the dark side of the work.
