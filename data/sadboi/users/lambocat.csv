AskMen,foynlwq,t1_foxkd5o,1588175765.0,"This. I can‚Äôt say I ever wanted to cheat on my current boyfriend, because the thought of being with anyone else killed me, but we were going through a serious rough patch, and I started feeling neglected. (Rough patch lasted about 8 months) I was extremely vulnerable and one of my old flames decided to confess that he kinda developed feelings for me. I remember showing my best friend the screen shot and telling her that I‚Äôm going to stay away because I‚Äôm really vulnerable and hurt right now and would never want to cross the line. Why didn‚Äôt I end the relationship with my bf? Because I was(am) in love with him. I felt like if we got through the rough patch, we‚Äôd get through anything. I didn‚Äôt want to lose him, and he didn‚Äôt want to lose me. I didn‚Äôt consider ever reigniting things with the old flame, but for a moment I thought to myself ‚ÄúI can see how if someone isn‚Äôt careful, this could lead to something really bad‚Äù Of course, this does not justify cheating, and if I did anything, I would consider myself a shitty person."

Other than that, you could also be holding onto water weight! If you haven‚Äôt worked out in a while, your body may be retaining fluids, as well as muscle soreness causes weight gain.

Also, I guess I‚Äôll add this, OP. My current bf is one of those that are embarrassed/ashamed to confront me after they mess up, but please emphasize that they have to face the music. Actions = consequences and it‚Äôs not okay for your partner to be selfish when they‚Äôre the one who messed up."
