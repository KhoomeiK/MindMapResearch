ptsd,f679h9s,t1_f3sbo5e,1572717671.0,Yes therapy has helped and yes it was scary. It’s never easy to bare your inner most soul to anyone. Do try keep in mind that it’s an on-going process. There no single action or advice that will cure mental trauma
ptsd,f3qi077,t3_dhm1vj,1571075038.0,"Distractions have been the most useful to me. Games, books, movies, old tv shows, creative writing."
ptsd,f3qh02f,t3_dhme6j,1571074552.0,I avoided therapy for years. It help me to write it down. When I started talking to my therapist about my sexual assault I had the to read from the paper like a script. There is no shame in it. Getting your story out is the important part
ptsd,f3qeodh,t3_dhs58b,1571073605.0,"I’m sorry. Try writing down the names of people in your life that love and support you during these difficult times. A visual aid can be useful in putting certain aspects of of a problem in perspective. Contact a crisis help line if you need to. And be sure to contact and doctors or therapists that have pets fined you medication, people can build a tolerance to medicines. I myself developed a tolerance to the medication that I’m on for my ptsd and has to be perscribed a different formula."
ptsd,f33mmzo,t3_dff3pn,1570641237.0,"‘Normal’ is a matter of perspective. Only time and hard work can bring you to your sense of normalcy. Start by Trying to take on little things in your life and try to make  them feel normal to you again. In time they can add up and your mental state can improve. See a therapist, even if it’s only once a month, he/she can provide more specific guidance"
ptsd,f1fl2dm,t3_d90qra,1569446810.0,"Even though you see it as a small degree of molestation you should discount what was done to you. You were violated. Perhaps not in a violent way but it was still a violation. This person took away a part of your emotional identity, your sense of safety, and your sense of purity. I understand your hubby’s frustrations but he should understand the way that what you have gone through has effected you. I do like the fact that he is doesn’t want to get laid with anyone outside of your marriage, I’ve known too many guys that would POUNCE at the first opportunity.
I have only two recommendations: therapy and communication."
ptsd,f1fjhq6,t3_d9637h,1569445803.0,Many people see PTSD as a label for certain trauma. This is mostly due to way liberal media and Hollywood portray those who suffer from PTSD. People tend to dismiss trauma nowadays unless they notice missing limbs or see a horrifying video. Trauma is trauma. Don’t discount the fact that you still have you all your limbs and mental faculties. You have been hurt mentally and you deserve the same quality of treatment as those who have lost more.
ptsd,f1fi5su,t3_d965a7,1569444984.0,"This is a common issue. Nightmares can share anyone to their core regardless of real world trauma, but for those of us who have suffered real world events a nightmare can easily reopen old mental wounds and can make you feel as though you’ve lost ground in your treatment. It’s good to keep in mind that you had no control over the nightmare, very few people have that kind of active control in the dreamscape. Experiencing something that could reawaken traumatic feelings is normal for those of us who have had traumatic experiences. 
Don’t let this unfortunate situation discount the progress to you have made, everyone experiences a setback at some point. If you are seeing someone for treatment be sure to bring up this fear that you have lost progress"

ptsd,f18nlgw,t3_d871mn,1569260589.0,I’ve found some techniques like sensory deprivation to be pretty affective.
ptsd,f18mnc9,t3_d830yk,1569260190.0,It’s a very common problem. A lot of veterans get severe anxiety trying to get by in a civilian work environment. Having ptsd is a stigma in our society that prevents a lot of people of even getting the jobs that they apply for.

ptsd,eylochp,t3_cxc8b2,1567188805.0,"That’s pretty common. People feel the illusion of safety in their own home. A friend of mine has pretty some severe triggers when he goes out so he says he plans things out as best he can, like he  says he goes into a grocery store the minute they open for business, that way there are the fewest number of people. He hasn’t been to a concert or the movies in several years and we hardly see him at church anymore."
houston,eyifizf,t3_cx1gbo,1567101770.0,Too bad they don’t lead the country in hiring war veterans with PTSD. Then my friend wouldn’t be on the verge of homelessness. So much for all those “Support our Troops” bumper stickers I see on luxury cars.
ptsd,eyieidw,t3_cx2rb3,1567101355.0,It’s a very common problem. My friend has been going to therapy for years because of what happened to him in the Marines and every session his psychiatrist has to remind him to never do things like downplay his PTSD or question the validity of what he is going through. It’s been fortunate that politicians and the media try to downplay the traumas of US citizens

ptsd,ey155ka,t1_ey13rni,1566690093.0,"My friends goes to therapy as well. It’s his therapist that convinced him to tell us his story. He had kept it secret since 2007. 
He says therapy hasn’t made him feel better but it has made him feel more stable. I felt like a terrible friend after he said what really happened to him, I used to tell him that the love a good woman with a great heaving bosom what help him. I feel like such a piece of shit after re-reading that."

Since he told us what caused it, too many members of his friends and family have told him to just “get over it” or they just don’t believe him. As of right now I don’t think he’s even tried dating in the last 5 years"
