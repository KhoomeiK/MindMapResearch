My degree was nursing so the theoretical aspect of it wasn’t so important but I really felt I’d fucked it when I didn’t turn my paper in. I felt I’d closed myself off to other opportunities and would have to go back years down the line if I wanted to teach or lecture in my subject. I’ve since qualified and learnt it isn’t a big deal- I’m years off wanting to teach and I can just go back and polish off the thesis in my spare time if I want to do a masters etc. It was gutting at the time and set me back massively in my estimations of myself but now it’s fine, what happens happens.

As for the job, seeing patients in A&E, on the wards, regardless of age at times. You deal with a LOT of self harm, suicide attempts and overdoses in emergency. You’ll also see mental health presentations on the wards. I know it’s very different in the UK but there are a lot of cut throat and risky decisions made- do you commit someone in terms of their risk or do you let them go with the risk of them self harming again? Our liaison nurses aren’t paid enough frankly, the level of risk and decision making skill is extraordinary at times.

Maybe this will fizzle out, maybe it won’t with this girl. To be honest, even though your relationship is polyamorous she isn’t showing you much respect at the moment with the lack of calls, texts and general understanding. As I understand it, and I’ve never been in one so don’t quote me, genuine poly relationships pull the plug on external relationships if one partner has an issue. As I see it, she knows you’re upset, she knows you’re being redeployed, and yet she’s still acting the ass. 

I dunno. I guess you could just give it time and ride it out. You can’t make her come home, you can’t make her talk.

BipolarReddit,fq0liog,t3_ggcxrl,1589033873.0,"I think it depends on what you’re using the Seroquel for. In low doses it’s an antihistamine that’s excellent for sleep- at your dose it’s an antipsychotic, which trazadone isn’t. If you’re using the Seroquel to stop manic, psychotic or depressive symptoms it may well be that your symptoms may return as you remove it from your medicines regimen. If you’re just taking it as a sleep aid, the switch will likely be okay. Trazadone is much, much better for weight gain that’s for sure. 

I’ve been on Seroquel for years and try as hard as I might I simply can’t get off it. I’ve battled with my weight as a result but I’ve managed to lower my dose to such a degree that it works to stop my psychosis and depression, but doesn’t cause me to gain much weight or increase my appetite much. It does still make me hungry and I do still get symptoms but it’s okay I guess. At 300mg I developed a binge eating disorder and gained about 25kg. I simply had no option in the end but to drop the dose or I was risking my physical health. I couldn’t take more than about 200mg of the stuff without eating like a horse every night."
BipolarReddit,fq0krup,t3_ggewna,1589033521.0,"Quetiapine is excellent for depression, or it has been for me. Long and the short of it is you will be on it for a long time- medications don’t ‘cure’ bipolar, they simply help ameliorate the symptoms such that you can lead a normal life. The battle is always finding a medication that suits you long term, with maximal effect on your depressive symptoms and minimal side effects. It’s taken me a long time but I have finally found a set of medications that suit me well- I won’t lie, I get side effects and I still have symptoms, but the meds keep me well in the main. 

Bottom line is, sadly, and as much as I’m sure you don’t particularly want to hear it, medications are often for life. I work as a psych nurse in inpatient and for the most part the main reason my guys are admitted is to a) substance misuse and b) stopping their meds. It’s imported to realise that you will need to be on your meds for a while- it’s a hard thing to accept and may take time to process, but there’s no use anyone lying to you about it. Take the meds and you’re all good, stop taking them, it’s likely your symptoms will return full force."

My girlfriend has a condition called neurofibromatosis. Hard to explain but it’s a biological derangement of protein in the body. She has tumours all over her body and grows new ones quite often. She’s also got scoliosis as a result and, perhaps worst of all, a natural pregnancy carries a 50% chance of the child also having it. She’s been through IVF with her ex and it was heartbreaking. She wants children of course, but won’t go through IVF again because it fucking ruined her. So if we were to have children naturally, which is our only option really, we’d have to take our chances. Our child could be severely disabled. Quite honestly, she carries such a weight on her shoulders about it, but really it doesn’t bother me- if we choose to have children we will have to take our chances.

Option 1 is that the drug simply hasn’t worked. Whichever receptors it’s meant to hit it basically hasn’t, it happens. I’m on 125mg of Seroquel- some nights it floors me, some nights it does shit all. I could pump myself to the eyeballs with benzos and hypnotics and it would still do shit all, it happens I guess. I can’t give you a pharmacological reason for this but it happens.

Option 2 is that the drug has an opposite effect on you. This happens with sleep drugs sometimes. I once had a patient on the ward given ambien and he was awake for 72hrs straight. It’s called a paradoxical effect, and it’s quite common."
BipolarReddit,fpk5gm1,t3_gdlp8s,1588688358.0,"Yeah, for about two years. I was misdiagnosed as bipolar 1/ bordering on schizoaffective due to my drug and substance abuse. It did nothing really for me, I wasn’t psychotic or manic so I just took it because I was advised to. 

I don’t really have any pros because for bipolar 2 it doesn’t really do much unless it’s combined with with fluoxetine for depression. I gained quite a bit of weight, which I lost very quickly when I stopped taking it. 

That said, I’m a MH nurse working in acute inpatient, and I dish it out a lot on meds round. From a clinical perspective, fuck me is it effective. I’ll be careful how I say this but I had a patient who was hostile, aggressive, floridly psychotic and basically all over the shop on admission. 3 weeks later he’s a different man and ready to be moved to an open ward. Zyprexa is a ball buster of a drug- does what it says on the tin. If you can manage the side effects, it does well for mania, psychosis and schizophrenia, like, really fucking well. Those side effects though, I wouldn’t take it unless I was properly unwell. If I did I’d venture that I’d be kissing my weight loss goodbye and sleeping 14 hours a day."
BipolarReddit,fpk45t4,t3_gdo88z,1588687626.0,"Mine have always been quite spontaneous really. My ex wife knew because she was with me when I was diagnosed, she later stopped giving a shit but that’s another story. I worked with my current girlfriend for many years on the wards. She was a nurse and I was a support worker, then a student on final placement. She knew when we were friends because we talked about it, so when we got into a relationship 6 months later it was nothing new to her. Frankly I couldn’t hide it. Despite being well medicated and ‘stable’, it’s fairly obvious when I’m depressed or hypomanic. 

Being honest and candid leads to your partner potentially being a real source of support for you. If you’re not there’s always the potential that things could go south, you have an episode and your partner has no idea what’s going on. Depends really on what kinda bipolar you have. You can’t hide a florid manic psychotic episode could you? Can you really hide a severe depressive episode. 

If you’re comfortable, tell your partner. If they are shocked, provide resources they can look into and be honest. At the end of the day it’s not your fault you have this condition. I always refer to it as having faulty wiring in my brain, nowt much I can do about it so I tell my partner when I’m struggling. Don’t be scared about it- like I said if you tell them they can be a great support to you.

Edit:- like right now, I’m in a massive depressive episode. My girlfriend is at work, we keep in touch.

BipolarReddit,fpjrlz0,t3_gdqycx,1588678960.0,"Wow, okay, umm... yeah. 

Greater risk of STD’s with bipolar? Nope not really. Sure, hyper sexual behaviour can result in more sexualised behaviour with more partners but it can also result in more self pleasure/ sex with a regular partner. I get hyper sexual from time to time but it wouldn’t make me want to cheat on my partner, we just have more sex which is fine. 

Is it a jackpot having someone who’s hyper sexual? No, it’s not. To be with someone with bipolar means you accept them for all of it, not just ‘use’ the bit you enjoy and leave the bit you don’t. Mania often leads to depression, hyper sexual behaviours often lead to an episode of not wanting any contact with anyone for a time. If you want to be with someone with this condition, you need to love and accept both. 

The more I read your post the more I wondered if it was a troll. I’d like to think not, but if you intend on being with someone with bipolar, you need to love the whole person, not just take advantage when they’re displaying hyper sexual behaviours. You referring to it as a ‘jackpot’ leads me to believe you may not do so."

This is very strictly NOT medical advice, but I have done just fine on latuda eating maybe 2-3 hours before taking it. For a long time I used to eat my small meal religiously before it, but since I met my girlfriend I’ve been a little more lax about it. I mean, I see no clinical difference in my mood in between eating 350kcals prior in comparison to not. I think I’ve kinda got away with it shall we say. The meal before thing was always difficult- it didn’t make me gain weight per se but it did effect my social life having to eat then take it etc. Since I met my partner I’ve been quite a bit more lax, and I’ve really seen no impact on my mental state since being such. 

The above clearly is not medical advice but yeah, from my perspective I don’t worry to much about the eating thing. As long as I’ve had a decent meal a few hours before, I don’t worry too much. I used to religiously eat 350kcals but now I don’t. And I agree, that ‘latuda meal’ really impacted on my weight loss."
AskMen,fpgmh0j,t3_gd1ke6,1588605551.0,"Me and my ex were involved in an evangelical church movement that bordered on a cult- we were both die hard Christians at that point. Of course we forgot the whole no sex before marriage thing and we found out we were pregnant. Church rules basically pushed us into marriage. My ex had adopted her nephew who calls me dad- he’s autistic and was four at the time. 

We got married, no honeymoon, I woke up the morning after and just knew in my heart it was a mistake. I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder 3 month later, then my ex wife found she had cancer and had two major operations following my daughters birth. My mental health was ruined, I couldn’t help her. She kicked me out 10 months into our marriage because I tied a ligature round my neck. I lost my faith, she continued to be an evangelical. She blamed my loss of faith for the demise of our marriage. 

I knew instantly it was a mistake. My ex wife is basically a psycho now. I took my meds, went to therapy and did my nurse training in the years following, she did none of that. I’m reasonable now, she’s not. We divorced two years later, she continues to play games with my kid. She never had any insight into her behaviour, I knew I was unwell and got help. I loved her, sure, but the whole thing was a mistake and I know that now. 

In a new relationship now with no plans to marry. My current partner is also divorced and I think we’ve agreed between us that marriage is an avoidable piece of paper that unnecessarily ties you to a person.

It’s an excellent med for preventing and ‘soothing’ depressive episodes which I have had many, but not so good with mania or treatment of acute depressive episodes. What it’s done for me is shave the worst bits of my depressions off and generally made me more stable in the sense that my episodes are typically shorter and less debilitating, meaning I can often still work through them without having to call in sick or not see my kids. My doc added it in fairly recently and I rate in very highly. 

Side effects? Definitely effects my cognition and memory to an extent, but that’s hard to determine because I’m also on lithium. I guess I also feel a bit emotionally dulled by it, but I’ve felt that way since my doctor initiated lithium as well. You’ll need to watch out for the rash when you start it, ain’t nice so be aware as your doc will no doubt tell you.

Many of our patients need time in seclusion or extra care because they can’t tolerate the stimulation of the main ward.

Whilst you have depressive episodes and you’ve had to go down the ECT route a manic episode is, in my opinion at least, wayyyy more destructive than any depression. I’m a nurse working in high dependancy, BP2 as well, and trust me the states people are admitted in aren’t pretty. I deal mainly with the more chaotic and aggressive forms of mania and honestly you don’t want to find yourself with one of those. I appreciate ECT was fucking tough but you don’t need a grand manic episode to confirm a bipolar diagnosis.

It’s a long road, take it slow and take meds as directed. Bipolar often involves a cocktail of meds rather than just one or two.

BipolarReddit,focvowx,t1_foche1l,1587676502.0,"I couldn’t really comment on brain damage but I would suggest it could be side effects from antipsychotics, heavy duty ones often knock a person out and they can often be given at breakfast and bedtime until the person is stable. If he’s on a depot or injection this takes a while to settle as well. From my perspective it is completely normal that he’s experiencing this- what we do is essentially medicate, medicate, medicate until the person is well again. It’s very different to community treatment- drugs are initiated fast and the side effects are often quite gruesome. It’ll be up to his community doctor to switch a few bits around to minimise side effects for him. And yes, it’s likely that no meds for 8 years could make things worse- do bear in mind as well that mania can often be followed by a depression which may contribute to how he is at the moment."

From a nursing perspective what I see is you get two options- you either fall under the radar or you’re on a waiting list or they come down on you and get you sectioned multiple times. There doesn’t seem to be anywhere in between. Our unit has only 6 patients now with no new referrals which is kinda bizarre, given we’re normally swamped and always full. Inpatient is working the way it always does- no COVID cases yet but we scrub up with suspected cases. Normal staffing levels and normal day to day. 

In terms of patient stuff I guess I’m fine. I see my doc every 3 months, if I’m acutely unwell they do everything to avoid an admission and I guess the services are there if I need them. I’ve never really had an issue except for having to wait months for an appointment. First time I was referred my doc saw me was within 2 weeks because I was really unwell but had to push and push to get it.

It’s fine I guess. Underfunded but the care is still there. There are good doctors and bad doctors, good nurses and bad nurses. Good care and total shite care."

My struggle has always been with Seroquel. I gained 80lbs on that drug and had to have my dose lowered because my binge eating became so bad I was literally making myself sick every night through eating too much. When I reduced my dose I went on a diet and lost all of it, then regained about 2 stone when I friend of mine died. I struggled to get it off, then I met my partner. 

Binge eating pretty much always happens in the evening or late at night for me. My girlfriend moved into my studio flat for a month when she left her ex partner, and wakes up at 5.30am for work. I therefore had a problem- I couldn’t sit and eat bags of crisps or chocolate next to her because I would wake her up. I couldn’t be fucked to go sit in the communal kitchen so I guess I just... stopped. I stopped going to the shop late at night and I stopped emotionally eating during the day. 

What I learnt from this is binge eating is like a muscle you really don’t want. When you use a muscle a lot, it grows, but when you don’t it becomes weak and shrinks. So, if you stop binge eating or reduce it a little, the urge to do it becomes less. Trust me when I say this- the more you practice NOT binge eating the better you’ll become at saying no to it. I’d also recommend taking some time to consider why you binge- is it emotional? Depression? What could you do instead of binge eating?"

I know kids with separated parents can actually be very stable in life but I guess my complete fuck up of a marriage didn’t help. I was really symptomatic back then, nowadays I’m not so much. 

I find my daughter hard work. I feel I don’t have much empathy when I’m with her and I’m quite emotionally ‘checked out’. I don’t really deal with her crying or tantrums too well either. I mean, I’m not neglectful by any stretch of the imagination at all, far from it, but I just feel sometimes I’m not very caring. My ex on the other hand is wayyyy emotional, so I suppose we balance each other out in some sense. 

Do I think my daughter will grow up with BPD? No, because I’m far too aware of my symptoms to ever show her that side of me.

You need to think of the long haul and realise that bipolar needs medication (I’ll get in trouble for saying that but I feel it’s true!). Think of bipolar like a... leaking tap. A leaking tap that a plumber has tried again and again to fix, to no avail, so all you can do is put a plug in it and keep it there. If you take the plug out the water will start pouring out again, and you’ll get unwell again, be it in 6 days or 6 months. Finding the right medication will also help too- if you’re stable but gaining weight and sleeping 15 hours a night it isn’t right, ask for a change. The happier you are with your meds the more likely you are to take them. If you really really struggle with taking your meds and you’re constantly relapsing, I’d suggest looking at a depot injection like invega or abilify.

It is possible to be tachycardic if you are bouncing around doing 15,000,000 things at once or your anxiety is bad enough that your body responds to it by being aroused. In short, yes it’s possible to experience tachycardia during mania. I’d also look into what medication you’re on as well- some antipsychotics can fiddle with your heart rhythm and activity too."
BipolarReddit,fn7gs6i,t3_fyxa75,1586720026.0,"Ah it’s not great really. The UK is different but the problems are the same. Services are free at the point of access, which is good, but you wait months for an appointment and my general feeling is that they either tell you you’re not unwell enough or they come down and section you, seems to be one of the two. I work as a nurse in inpatient services and this does seem to be the case- the lack of beds means that really, really unwell people are left out in the community with nowhere to go, often deteriorating further. 

One good thing over here is that medications are all the same price. Granted we’re behind the US in terms of patenting; drugs like rexulti and vraylar aren’t even in the early stages of testing yet but every medication, branded or otherwise, is the same price, £10. I get a prepayment certificate for £110 which covers me entirely for the year. That’s one good thing over here- I can be on a branded, very expensive medication that the NHS will cover for me. 

So it’s fine I guess. I’ve fallen in between the cracks before- I’ve never had a hospital admission and have always been told I’m too ‘well’ to warrant one, despite being severely unwell at the time. As a nurse I will say this- the sentiment is true, there are no beds, you either get turned away or sectioned multiple times, and the NHS is struggling under the weight it’s trying to carry. As a patient it’s fine I guess. I see my doc once every 3 months, I take my meds and I wouldn’t be admitted to hospital unless I had to be."
BipolarReddit,fn7dlsp,t3_g010bg,1586718241.0,"I’m not on vraylar but I’ve been on many medications in the same class and type. 

After a small amount of research what you are experiencing is quite normal- meds like this often cause drowsiness (which can be helpful if you struggle to sleep) and also cause weight gain/ appetite increase when you take them. As my dose of Seroquel increased my hunger got worse and the sedation became a lot more intense. 

What you’re experiencing is normal. If possible, try to avoid the hunger, eat healthy foods and monitor your weight closely. With regard to the sedation, I would suggest taking it just before you go to bed and maintaining a regular pattern of sleep. In my experience the sedation will wear off a little with time and you’ll get used to it, and you’ll be able to deal with the hunger pangs better too."
