PoliticalCompassMemes,flyp3gt,t1_flyolo5,1585606338.0,I am not an expert in the field but I share the sentiment that child molesters are scum but pedophiles who don't act on it deserve some sympathy. I heard that drugs that repress sexual desires are often used though I'm not sure what the quality of life is on those drugs. It's probably better to have them attend therapy or at least be able to talk about it because when people repress desires it can lead to all sorts of bad things. My main point is that making people who have no control over their desires repress those desires completely or fear being deemed horrible by society is probably counter productive.
PoliticalCompassMemes,flyoeed,t1_flyn9o7,1585605960.0,All of the things you're referencing are personal choices. Allowing people to do something to their own body is not the same as letting them do something to someone else. This is a false equivalency.

politics,fkp5x6y,t1_fkp1sy8,1584402521.0,Yeah it's pretty ironic. It's not even just m4a either. I find Bernie Sanders supporters in general on here insufferable.

politics,fkp14gs,t1_fkp0v9f,1584399444.0,Public option doesn't sound like the worst thing. As you said of the government option really is cheaper it'll create competition again and probably drive down insurance costs. I admittedly am no healthcare or policy expert but public option doesn't seem to be as bad as some of the die hard m4a supports are making it out to be.
politics,fkozrra,t1_fkozcia,1584398598.0,Yeah I'm not trying to say you're incorrect just that people taking the polls aren't being logically sound. While in concept competition could drive down prices the current American system lets a small amount of companies basically control most markets and set high prices if they want. I don't have much against capitalism in theory I just think it lends itself to coporatism far too often and that's where I feel America is atm.
politics,fkoyy8n,t1_fkovyae,1584398088.0,This would mak sense if Medicare for all wouldn't end up costing less than most people in America's insurance thus saving them money.

Private healthcare isn't freedom its just submitting to cooperate entities instead of the government.
