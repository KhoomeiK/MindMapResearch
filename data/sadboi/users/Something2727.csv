BPD,ffazfdw,t3_esixfd,1579748050.0,I know its toxic to them but i literally feel like life isnt worth living without them if they leave.
BPD,fdu2o79,t3_en3r5i,1578726447.0,"My current bf has NPD and i have to say that it is the best relationship either of us have had. We find that the characteristics are pretty similar and we balance well. BPD is the perfect match for NPD because NPD needs constant attention, and BPD cant stand being alone and will give that attention. The reasons these could end badly is due to the fact that BPD has some very strong emotions that NPD has a hard time supporting. I dont know if that makes sense but hope that helps."
BPD,fdu1i0c,t3_emyry4,1578725844.0,That is one major accomplishment. You should be so proud. Im so happy your here
