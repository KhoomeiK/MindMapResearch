GriefSupport,fa0d0nl,t3_d5fwvo,1575753034.0,"Yes I can relate completely!

My mum was everything to me - I was SCARED of how much I loved her. i hated being away from her for too long as I would get ´´home sick´´. She was my best friend, my...just everything. If I ever thought of her dying, I would think I would immediately die too. But when she got cancer, I nursed her and watched her die: I was totally numb. I was in autopilot caring for her. After she died I was on a weird high. I immediately started a new job, was partying, staring having a fling with a guy.... I was acting as if I was happy she died. It was mental.  I was on that high for 2 months, then it started to settle in and I was like ´´what the fuck am I doing here without my mum?\`\`(cos I was only living in that county (Austria) to be with her and we had a life there together, and suddenly she wasnt there and I was living in her apartment and seeing her friends etc....it made no sense that I was there). So I decided to quit my job and get rid of everything and become a minimalist and had a plan to travel around Australia in a van - so a totally new life. I became so obsessed with this minimalist idea that I once again was not thinking about my mum and was on another ´´high´´.   After getting rid of all her stuff and my stuff, I went to be with my dad in Kenya for a while. Finally the grief started coming, but my dad could not handle seeing me upset, so once again I just pushed the grief aside and tried to focus on getting things in order for my Australia plan.

So it wasnt until I got to Australia (9 months after my mum died) that i finally HAD A BREAKDOWN. I felt like I was dying, the pain was unbearable. So I had to get out of Australia and just needed to be with my dad. But on my way back to be with my dad, my dad choked on a piece of meat and died. When I got the news, I almost had to be hospitalized cos I was screaming so much.

Since then I have been intensely grieving the loss of both my parents. And especially of my mum. And now it is 2.5 years since my mum died and I think I feel it more intensely than ever.

What happens is that when you lose someone you love so much, it is so traumatic and such a shock that the brain protects you by making you go numb and feel like you dont care. In a way, I wish I could have stayed in that mental place forever, cos now that the grief has come, it is such unbearable pain and it feels like it will never ever ever get better. After my mum died my brain played a trick on me and convinced me that my life was just beginning. Now that the grief has come, I feel like I want to die.

So yeah, I hate to tell you but... the grief will come :( Just be prepared for it when it does come, cos you dont know when that might be, but you need to have structure and people around you etc. for when it does come."

I always thought if they died, I would immediately die too cos the pain would be too much to bear. But I could never imagine I would lose them so soon and in this way. it was my worse ever nightmare. And this nightmare never ends. 

Since they died, I have wanted to die too. But I decided I had to keep going cos I am still young and have so much going for me and so much other stuff to be grateful for and still stuff I want to experience. So I have kept going and going, all on my own as I have no other family. I moved to a new country to ´start a new life´´and I tried to make the best life I could for myself.

But right now I feel I cannot even push through another day - i just want to die right now. 

I used to be so so happy, I had such a great life and I was so motivated and energetic and peaceful. Now my entire soul died with them. I am just so so so desperately unhappy. And when i am not crippled with depression, i am highly anxious. I really feel my life is over - I should have died with them, I am not supposed to be here without them. I am crawling in my skin, my heart has been ripped out, I am still in shock and I cant let go of them - especially my mum.

I used to love life so much but since my parents died and I went through a lot of trauma, I am alone in the world and severely depressed and feel the world is so meaningless. I so much want my old life back, for them to still be alive, but I have to accept that my past is gone forever and they are gone forever.... and so I want to die now too, to end the pain and suffering. I have tried all the many steps to deal with grief and depression etc., but the pain of my aching heart is too strong, nothing can truly ease the pain - only perhaps numb it for a little while. 

I am keeping going for now cos I am still young and want to explore some more of the world and of life before I die, but I am planning to kill myself in the next 8 years. Still 8 years is a long time to be carrying this grief and pain, but at least it isnt forever. It gives me ease knowing that I will be dead in 8 years, so I dont have to worry about planning my future anymore, all I have to do is live for today, and I will die before I get old."

And then I fight again to get back up, take 10 steps forward and then fall again, taking 50 steps backwards!  Put the pieces of myself together again slowly, only to smash myself into a million pieces again.... it is so exhausting..... 

Next week i am going to a special Healing Retreat where I am going to learn how to do meditation, and do reiki therapy and they have all sorts of other mind healing stuff... and i will go hiking in the nature etc. I am sure this will pull me out of the depression for now - but i hope to learn some proper life skills for how to deal with my hurt mind and grief so that i can continue to maintain balance and dont fall again. I hope I can finally learn how to Live one day at a time and be in the present and stop constantly thinking about the past with my parents and worrying about the future.

SuicideWatch,f95dnts,t3_e3uay7,1575125529.0,"I totally agree with you regarding becoming nothing after death, ceasing to exist. I used to believe in magic, spirits etc. but then both my parents died, and in the beginning I so desperately wanted to hang onto some notion that they werent really gone, their spirits were somewhere or something. However, as I could not feel them and it became clear they were not watching over me, I has to reconsider my notions about what happens after death. And so, open mindedly, I started researching. And I too came to the conclusion that the only plausible explanation to what happens after we die is that we simply become nothing and stop existing - forever, like before we were born. And although this notion takes the magic out of life and makes life seem somewhat meaningless cos we just live and die and thats the end, I am actually OK with it. If we are just nothing, then that actually sounds like the most peaceful thing in the world. And it actually makes our time being alive easier in a way, cos we dont have to keep searching for some higher meaning or purpose as we come to realise that our existence is only temporary, so our sole purpose should be to just to get as much enjoyment out of the experience of being alive as possible (of course the main purpose for all animals is to reproduce, but as we are intelligent human beings, we now know that we need not reproduce to keep the race alive as there are too many of us in the world and not enough resources). 

Interesting what you said about suicide as a way of survival.  It makes sense. There are also some animals who commit suicide. 

Anyway, despite all of this, once you are dead you are dead forever, and this experience you have of being alive is only temporary and very short in comparison to the foreverness of death, so whilst I totally understand wanting to die now cos life is hard and death seems so peaceful, why not stick around a bit longer and explore the experience of being alive....."

*What's with this generation and their obsession with DEATH and wanting to DIE!?*

*It's like every time I hold a conversation with people, or just so happen to overhear someone's conversation, they almost always mention ""dying"" as if life is SO HARD. I don't understand why people just want to die so badly. Like, you have a lot to live for. What's the purpose of wanting to die so bad? And what if the day comes where you ACTUALLY die? Will you be satisfied? No, you'll be dead. You won't feel anything (as far as we know 'cause no one knows what happens after death).*

*I remember being friends with a coworker, and it was like every conversation we'd have, she'd mention wanting to kill herself, or die....but would mask it as a ""joke."" I confronted her about this morbid way of thinking, and she said I was hating on her. Mind you, she has morbid, joking thoughts, but is a freaking STAR student, headed to college, has rich parents, the whole NINE YARDS....and for some reason, she thought it was cool to brag about ""suicide"" and/or ""life being so hard...""*

*Look, I'm no ray of sunshine. I've been through a lot of things in life, and I've had my fair share of thoughts of not feeling worthy enough. But, for people to actually joke about suicide and continuously talk about dying so bad, I'm afraid for our future generations. It's like people love embracing the fact of ""just getting by"" and being so needy, and when things aren't going well, 'WELP, MIGHT AS WELL JUST DIE..""*

Im sorry but if you think my comment was insensitive then it seems like you encourage this kind of dramatic behaviour. 

There are people in the world born into slums, starving to death, with all sorts of health problems, with no family, with no opportunity to even go to school, people who are raped, tortured...people who really really do want to be dead instead......

Ok so maybe this person has some other reasons for feeling suicidal - but this post suggests that the person wants to kill themselves because they failed an exam. And to me that sounds like this person is just being a total drama queen spitting around comments like \`I´ll just kill myself!´  just because they failed a test and when they dont even really mean it - which is offensive to the people who actually really are suicidal and for good reasons.

How the hell would my comment above cause this person to kill themselves?! I was trying to make them see the bigger picture of life and that a silly maths exam is no reason to want to kill yourself! I was just trying to put some perspective into their eyes! And to tell them that in a few years they will have forgotten about this silly maths test!

Im sorry, I dont mean to be harsh - I know you´re only a teenager and it is hard being a teen and it can seem at the time in that little teenage world ur living in that these small things matter. But u will see when u get older how much these things really dont matter and you will be free from all of it. 

I too failed maths and everything when I was in school but instead of killing myself, I decided to work my ass off to go from bottom of the class to top of the class and ace all my exams. It was hard but a hell of a lot easier than suicide! So suggest you use this latest exam failure as a lesson to motivate you to do better next time and do not beat yourself up about it. 

And if you dont do better next time even if you really tried hard, then just let it go - i promise you that it will not matter at all a few years down the line."

Depression and anxiety are polar opposites. So when I am in a depressed state - a black hole of despair - I have no energy to do anything at all, no motivation, and I dont give a fuck about anything. I sleep loads and my whole body and mind slow down.   Then when  I finally fight my way out of the depression, I go into a state of anxiety - which is a state where my mind is over active, thinking constantly, worrying about stuff, dont sleep much, body and mind just cant relax.
