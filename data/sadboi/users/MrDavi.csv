You should know that the entire point of psychiatry & mental health services involving drugs is that the patient, your brother, explains his symptoms & how the medications have changed his symptoms after taking them for however long then his psych & him work out how the medications should be changed to try to get a better effect, and this happens over and over for years b/c the medication needs change from month to month. That's the nature of the illness. He can't be treated if he doesn't know what he has. He's an adult, and they're withholding his own medical information from him? That's downright criminal. Secondly, have you read anything about what these medications can do to a person? They can give people permanent brain damage, give them seizures, cause dementia, and all kinds of things you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. He has a right to know what he's putting into his body, and he has a right to choose if he wishes to do so or not.

Even in a serious situation where someone is being beaten, lets say even beaten to death, could you do it? I've seen videos of cops that have had to kill people with guns that were firing at the officer. Even when protecting their own life after they kill the criminal they break down completely into a sobbing mess screaming and wailing in pure despair. I personally wouldn't think twice about protecting my family or myself, but the scars would be deep. Killing someone will completely change who you are for the rest of your life, and torment you forever. Legally you probably can't protect someone from being beaten in the streets with lethal force.

In the Call of Cuthulu games I've played there's something called fighting back which means when someone engages you in melee combat you can choose to fight back so you're both attacking each other even outside of your turn. Then in my system I have all combat be simultaneous so a player can take up to half of their move outside of their turn which leads to characters being blocked off when trying to retreat or advance. Then I also have entering a threat range give the character the option to attack instead of the D&D exiting an attack range. The base idea of how actions are used is very dependent on how the combat system itself works. There's really a huge number of actions someone can put into their game, but it's the combination of choices that really puts the combat over the top."

I've also had a GM that allowed a player to make a DEX check to get an action for free. So you take your first action then your next would be at a -5 but instead you roll DEX at the -5. If you succeed then your second action does not have that -5. Played with a guy that had a +8 to DEX, (which is doubled in Talislanta on Stat only checks) so he was rolling a +16 every time he attempted to get a free action.

It sounds simple in theory, but it adds extra math that a basic to strike vs AC, Defense, whatever the static score is, doesn't have. Throw on that I'm using a d100 for my system, and then you have players doing math like 87 - 56 +73-40 then subtracting that from their health which can realistically range from about 50 to 200.

This KILLED his drive for the game. He stopped paying attention & very openly expressed his distaste for combat & that he felt completely useless & like he was a burden. We convinced him to respec his character then in the final combat of the game, (after a 6 year campaign) he two shot the end boss with a double crit.

Most Republicans I know, (which aren't many) think the virus scare is a hoax by the Democrats to disrupt Trumps election chances & the virus isn't even as severe as the common cold. Probably just the fact that my family is full of nut jobs, but it is something I've noticed."

If you're looking for active skills like activating a fighting style & getting a bonus to all defenses then you'll have to come up with some basics of how the system functions mechanically first. A defensive fighting style that increases AC by 1 doesn't really matter in a system that only uses opposed combat & has no AC values."

Man I know what you mean about feeling exhausted. I've been working on my game non stop for at least 10 hours a day every day for a week straight. It's taking a lot out of me, but I want it to succeed so badly.  
I wouldn't be against sharing other people's work with my stuff. I'd have to really like the product though.

I'm on the Discord pretty much every day, and I try to dedicate as much time to helping individual people get into playing my game as possible. I like to think that these games are built on the individual. It only takes one game master to set off the spark that might make 6 people into life long players, and each of those might make 6 more. I like to see it as trying to reach as many individuals as I can, and do everything in my power to make it a good experience for every single person. That may be a bit of a dream though because just trying to figure out the logistics of reaching large amounts of people, and the incredible amount of time it takes is staggering."

schizophrenia,fm3pasp,t3_fsqg10,1585731892.0,"I write poetry about my Schizo sometimes. Here's one.

&#x200B;

The Hydras curse isn't for me.

A life devoid of happiness is no better with immortality.

Sometimes I sit and scrub.

Trying to wash the pain away.

But with every stroke I rub

I'm given enough work for another day.

It's not beautiful. It's not elegant.

With every head I grow less relevant.

Perhaps it's an addiction.

Perhaps not.

Perhaps it's an affliction.

Perhaps I give it too much thought.

Have you ever died to see the next day?

Have you ever closed your eyes to be thrown back into the fray?

That's what it's like to have the Hydras curse.

It's definitely not for me.

What a pleasure to finally meet a hearse.

For living without happiness is no better with immortality.

I have a problem where words unfocus & drift around the page as well. I scored a 34 out of 36 on my reading ACT in high school & I've always been amazing at English. I've always been able to identify root words, if they're Latin, Greek, or whatever, and figure out what words mean even if I've never read them before. I would even get into debates with my dad about which words were Greek or Latin & the root meaning of them. It's like all of this has went away, and I can barely read anymore. I was reading a single page of a web series called Pact, and it took me over an hour to finish it. Over an hour for a single page. My comprehension is garbage now too. I just have to read something over and over taking 10 times or longer than a normal person to get through basic text."

schizophrenia,flduoh6,t3_fnwcfk,1585072061.0,"Seeking help is very important. The trick is to tell your kid to be completely and totally honest. There's nothing they can't tell the psychologist, and anything left out might keep them from getting help. I was too afraid to tell people what was wrong with me as a kid. I even thought everyone else was in on it and against me.

My second rule of advice, that I tell everyone, is honesty honesty honesty. The moment you lie to him you can no longer be trusted, and you're one of them. You have to be completely honest with them at all times even if you know it'll be hard. Even if you think being honest may keep them from getting immediate help. You cannot lose their trust or they're entirely alone."
