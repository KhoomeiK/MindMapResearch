Hi, I'm 38, have combination/clear skin. Concerns: occasional pigmentation/anti-aging/dark circles under the eyes. 

I'm newish to the skincare routine game, as well as actives. After lurking on intothegloss.com and compulsively reading dermatologists' skin care routines, I've come about the following (vv simple routine). Would love suggestions and improvements -- especially in the actives department:

AM

CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser

La Roche Posay Hydraphase Intense Moisturizer SPF 20

Vichy Ideal Soleil SPF 50 Spray

PM

CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser

Paula's Choice 8% AHA Lotion Exfoliant (on alternate nights I use A313 pomade)

Elta MD Renew Eye Gel (not v regular)

La Roche Posay Toleraine Ultra Nuit/CeraVe Facial Moisturizing lotion (PM)

Should I tweak anything? My skin seems to be doing fine -- and is clear and glowy after the introduction of the AHA Lotion. Should I replace the A313 with the Paula's Choice BHA? Must confess I haven't quite understood what the difference between BHA and AHA is..."
