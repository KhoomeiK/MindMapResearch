Pets,evopk2u,t1_evo266i,1564653443.0,Ill probably opt out for a stick since I can use that against people/pets/coyotes. Anything dangerous when im out walking. Im a pretty short petite girl at 5”1’
Pets,evopgcc,t1_evodglq,1564653351.0,People are idiots!! Why would you allow your dogs to relax unrestrained if you know they would dash off at the sight of another dog? Especially during the sunset/evening time when its a no-brainer people walk their dogs during that time when its cooler. Im baffled.
Pets,evnxh2k,t1_evnx6l5,1564634240.0,"They tried his best to get them, but frenchies are fast and they avoided being caught. It was overwhelming having two dogs in my arms with one screaming, and two more dogs jumping me in circles 🤦🏻‍♀️ he eventually got them and hauled them inside the house."
heartbreak,esbq297,t1_es5bngo,1561806110.0,"Same for me. He and I had many firsts in the last 8 years we’ve been together. We were so in love, I was so in love. 

He would tell me he loves me & to never leave him. I would always tell him “Ill always be yours, As long as your love don’t change.” Those were our precious lines.

I sacrificed so much, so many situations that I risked for for him. Putting him first in everything, because I had complete faith and trust that he loved me just as much as I love him.

Until 1.5yrs later he’s now unsure. He wants to try to make it work still, to reignite the flame. But I dont know how I will be able to overcome the hurt I felt when he said the words “I dont.” When I asked if he still loved me. My whole world froze, my heart shattered, and all I could do after that was silently cry on the floor."
depression,erkmp4u,t1_erkc69z,1560966806.0,I cry to sleep too. Lets have comfort knowing that we’re both in the same boat.
depression,erkm5nc,t1_erkf9qn,1560966480.0,"The only career (seriously, I was only exposed to 1) growing up was medical field. I grew up with the mentality that I was gonna be a nurse because my whole family consists of CNA’s, RN’s, & Phlebotomists. It wasnt until I was 2 years into community college that I truly realized how much I hated my classes, how disinterested I was, and that I just dont like the medical field in general, its not for me. Plus im emotionally soft 🥴 My heart cant handle such a hard labor, emotional job. 

That being said, Im now 22. The age were classmates start graduating with bachelors degrees 4yrs after high school. Im here still clueless about a career choice, id hate to waste money on a degree I wont use. That pressure from the family, the disgrace you feel, feeling left behind. Its tough."
depression,erjwobg,t3_c2fuf3,1560949230.0,"This is so true. Its especially true in my culture as an asian because depression is thought of as taboo. Having a child with depression makes them think its the absolute end of the world, that they’ve got a ruined child and they’ve failed in raising me as my parent. 

Its not their fault, but with that mentality we cant share the feelings we have with people who we should feel most safe to talk about our emotions openly, without further feeling like a burden to the whole family. Then that shit spreads like wildfire through the family members 🤦🏻‍♀️"
depression,eqbsdrd,t1_eq9zdp1,1559955425.0,Thank you. I wish I was stronger
depression,eqb5n87,t1_eq9mttk,1559945234.0,"Im with you.

My boyfriend gives me this look when I cry. A look of guilt, but I know better. He’s said he’s tired of my pity parties.

I cry in private now."
depression,eq2mg5a,t3_bwy1w1,1559740085.0,"Its 6am and Ive been crying for 4hrs straight now. Tonight whimpering to myself 
“Why am I not good enough?” 

“I’m a good person, aren’t I?”"
heartbreak,epyoi6h,t3_bvi0bn,1559646136.0,"Ive asked myself that, too. Sometimes Im surprised Im able to keep crying for as long as I do. 

Its nice to know I’m not alone."
