I still resonate with this community though because of the reasons I do not want to actually bring life into this world. I think the most important thing is to always just respect others opinions. I know several people on this sub, like you, do not consider me true childfree. Which is why I never comment, because some people are not very respectful about it. Its hard to say it you are gatekeeping. I don‚Äôt know anyone else who shares my desire to not give birth and what not so I find lots of solace here.

The pool shot almost fits as a group/social shot because you appear to be at a party if that makes sense. 

You obviously can‚Äôt change this and I don‚Äôt want to insult you at all. The only reason I (25F) wouldn‚Äôt swipe is because I‚Äôm really tall.

So to me, putting in an extra hour a day, or 5 hours a week, to reach a full 40 hour work week seems perfectly reasonable. Whether I do that before/ after school or all on Sunday, I do what works for me.
