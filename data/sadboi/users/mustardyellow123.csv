I got an AB moisturizer recommended to me on a different sub for my acne prone skin. It has simple ingredients but has like 5 different ceramides in it. It worked at first for me but then I noticed it clogged my pores.

Just curious if you experience the same as me, because I’ve been also told ceramides don’t break you out except I’ve seen some people say they do so idk what to believe anymore lol"

politics,fqze349,t1_fqx49vj,1589765436.0,"Yep. They reopened restaurants in AZ this past week and there was a picture circulating of a popular bar in our college town that was completely packed with people. Apparently the police talked to the owner and said they just needed to separate some of the seating more, but I was under the impression they are supposed to only seat at half capacity and the entire place was full, so not sure how that just slid by without any repercussions. I work at a large restaurant myself and am not going back yet but according to my friend who works there also last night was the busiest they’ve been since reopening on Wednesday and that worries me.

Father’s Day and 4th of July are huge holidays for us and we are insanely busy those days. I’m worried they will ask me to come back then and I’ll lose my unemployment but the last thing I want to do is work on one of our busiest days of the year, especially if places are getting away with not following rules and correct procedures of social distancing. (I’m not sure if my restaurant is like that other one but knowing their past and the money hungry owner, I would not be surprised if the allure of a big holiday like one of those tempts them to also not follow CDC guidelines and allow more guests in than should be.)"

He’s been back and forth with a lady from the office that even gave him her personal number to help him but he still hasn’t received anything and she told him they are just extremely backed up and to be patient. I think he should try calling again and talking to someone else possibly because the person I talked to was able to fix my issue in less than 5 minutes.

Also if you are having trouble getting ahold of anyone I recommend calling when they first open. I had my phone and my dads phone. I called at 6:58am so that by the time I got trough all the prompts (press 1 for English, enter your social security number, enter your pin, etc) it was exactly 7am and I was on the line. I still had to be on hold for 25 minutes but I did get through. As I was on hold though I was curious so while I was still on hold with my phone I called off my dads phone at 7:08 and their call queues were already full and it hung up.

So it fills up fast! Every minute counts, try calling right before 7 so you’re on the line as soon as it hits 7am."

Then from my managers and co workers how this isn’t anything to worry about and how everyone is overreacting. 

I kind of just sat back and took it all in and would try to come up with my own opinions. While
Everyone was going back and forth at work I would just stay quiet and not weigh in, mostly because I was not sure what I thought yet. One coworker in particular kept going on and on about how this is just a flu and everyone was an idiot for freaking out and how we would never close down work because of it. 

Less than a week later we were closed. She would then text me and would say she still didn’t think it was serious because she didn’t know anyone who had it and that it was being made up.

Flash forward to now and they are talking about opening work back up and I told her I may not be going back and she said she felt the same. I asked her why and she said she didn’t feel safe. She was so far on the other end of it and totally changed her view. I am glad, but I remember when she was spouting out at work about how anyone who was scared was an idiot and I remember thinking “this is a bold statement for someone to say when this is all barely starting, she could be right but what if she’s terribly wrong?”.

AskReddit,fpftvlh,t1_fpfqo20,1588583308.0,Interesting. I don’t think I could watch it (I read the plot) but I did see a few commenters that also said it was well made.
AskReddit,fpftti5,t1_fpfp56f,1588583245.0,"I rented it on Amazon, it was truly terrifying! Really messed with me for a few days man..."
AskReddit,fpfgk00,t1_fpeguj3,1588570597.0,"Did not know that. I saw it years ago but the only part I remember was a woman getting disemboweled on a tree. I was really high. Kind of glad I don’t remember the animal parts now, I probably looked away tbh it’s been so long."
AskReddit,fpfgb9a,t1_fpehcqo,1588570395.0,I had to watch this in high school and I actually was very glad to have watched it afterwards.
AskReddit,fpfg6p7,t1_fpewd8m,1588570291.0,"Such a great classic but my dad is the same exact way. I read that people who felt this way watching the exorcist could not handle Hereditary. Have you seen it? I watched it for the first time a few weeks ago. The exorcist scared me as a child but as an adult I’m fine with it. However Hereditary terrified me and kept me up for DAYS afterwards I could not sleep. 

Kudos to the director for terrifying the fuck out of me because that doesn’t happen easily with scary movies and me."
AskReddit,fpfg006,t1_fpeiaje,1588570136.0,I watched this in high school haha. It’s not that bad it’s actually really funny and not what I was expecting.
AskReddit,fpffvm2,t1_fpf26sq,1588570034.0,Is this sarcasm or are you serious? Genuinely asking not trying to be rude.
AskReddit,fpffbg3,t1_fpelvi3,1588569569.0,"Same on the human centipede films. I’ve watched some gross horror movies and most don’t bother me honestly, I like horror movies and I think gorey ones are awesome but this whole concept just grosses me out beyond belief. I’ve never been able to sit down and watch any of them except one scene of one my friend showed me with a woman giving birth and then the baby dies in a very traumatic way. That didn’t fuck me up as much as the concept of the movie as whole so yeah no thanks. 

Haven’t heard of the second one."
AskReddit,fpfcx97,t1_fpfc8f2,1588567630.0,"Exactly. I mean I’m guessing that’s part of the reason they are reopening things is because they don’t want to pay everyone unemployment anymore or forever but all I can think about it how serving food/handling dishes/interacting with so many customers at once is going to = more people getting sick. My restaurant is also huge. Like we can fit 600 people inside and that doesn’t count the outside patio or the back private area for special events. 

Even if they don’t open at full capacity to fill all those seats, we then are going to all make less money on all our shifts because less guests. I make more on unemployment than I did when I was working there before because I only worked 4 days a week due to going to college as well. I’m going to make even LESS money when we reopen because it’s not going to be how it was before. And plus obviously risking the fact that I could get sick, or pass it to my elderly father who I live with. 

My boss i have known since I was a kid and is a kind man. Part of me is curious to ask him if he can “let me go” when they reopen but I don’t know how he would respond to that. I’ve tried looking for other jobs but the only other places are grocery stores around my area and those are just as bad I’m sure. I hate going grocery shopping because it’s already a crowded mess I can’t imagine the stress those poor workers face and the risks of also getting sick. 


It’s all so fucked. I have bad depression and anxiety and this has all put me in a very bad place mentally as it seems to to me there truly is no way for things to get better. So what’s the point?"
AskReddit,fpfbq4q,t1_fpfaa6g,1588566702.0,I work at a restaurant and I really am considering not going into work when they reopen but I also have to have some income. I’m not sure what to do but I’m so anxious thinking about it.
AskDocs,fpcl8be,t1_fpbstw1,1588504725.0,This happened to my mom too! We were so freaked out that something way worse was going on. But this was exactly it.
