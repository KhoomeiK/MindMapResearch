NewSkaters,fprcoan,t1_fprba0u,1588850326.0,"Okay man you're just being a dick. I learned to kickflip by landing with my front foot, then landing with my back foot and then putting it together and landing it with both. That's what works for me on 99% of my tricks so for you to say nobody practices like that is completely wrong. Why are you commenting on this sub trying to act like there's only one way of learning and if anyone wants to do it differently they're wrong? This sub is for new skaters to share and ask questions about tricks they're having trouble with, not for someone with 20 years of experience to act like they know it all. Dunno if putting down new skaters makes you feel good about yourself or what but gtfo with that shit."
NewSkaters,fpqmuzh,t1_fpptqsd,1588826593.0,"Idk man. It's only heelflips that give me this problem. I just learned fakie bigspins and landed some pretty good kickflips today. The kickflips I can catch with my back foot so easily because I can practice it. But for heelflips I just struggle getting my back foot on consistently and if I do I either land primo or have heel or toe drag. I think I just learn differently than you man, there's no right way to do anything. All I wanted was some tips so I could practice and get my heelflips more consistent."
NewSkaters,fppqkgb,t1_fpporbf,1588807233.0,"Quick question. Are you supposed to catch kickflips and heelflips with your back foot or not? Because I'm under the impression that you are, and if I can only catch it with my front foot that feels like a problem"
NewSkaters,fppmefn,t1_fpntjn9,1588804976.0,"I have to disagree. Yesterday I landed my first tre flip, but I had spent hours on it, everytime the board would fly away from me and I could only catch it with my back foot. So I started practicing catching it with my front foot. The way you have to lean on your back foot in order to keep your front foot in the air is ultimately what kept the board in front of me. Once I did that for a bit, I just tweaked it to where I wasn't leaning so far back and then just jumped forward and landed it. Sure landing with just one foot everytime is bad practice, but if you can also land it with the other foot you'll know what it feels like to lean too far both ways, which makes getting that center balanced weight much easier. And it also boosts your confidence, giving you the ability to commit much easier. I don't want to just flick my heelflips and hope the board lands under my feet each time. I want to be able to feel the type of balance I need and understand how to catch it with my backfoot."

NewSkaters,fkccimb,t1_fkcbtbz,1584050204.0,"Yes I do, however this is based on my own experience it may not apply to everyone. When I first started trying it, the board would shoot out in front of me and it seemed impossible to even stay over it. My strategy was to notice the error, and then practice overcompensating. If the board lands to your left, practice jumping to your left. If it goes behind you, jump a little behind you. If the board rotates at all, practice rotating your hips in the opposite direction. Of course the final product should have no hip rotation and very little jumping anywhere but straight up, but I found if you determine where the board is going, and then overcorrect where you will land, it ends up evening out until you get it down. Another thing is, with kickflips you kinda ninja kick your foot out to the side but I see a lot of people try that with heelflips and it's just not how it works. Slide your foot up and kick out in front of you. After you get it landing close to you, just jump high and commit. If you have trouble overcoming the fear of landing on it, practice on carpet or cut open some tennis balls and put them around your wheels so you can eliminate the fear. That's pretty much everything I think. Hope I helped. Keep it at!"

I spent a comeup playing Minecraft- you really do forget you're coming up because I remember specifically opening a chest and the items started waving and the HUD lines were also waving and for a moment I was like ""wait how am I tripping in Minecraft?"" And then had a dumbass realization that no, I am just tripping anyways."

LSD,f9t1ek1,t1_f9sx5b6,1575605912.0,I was once in the exact same boat. Just know it will get better! I now trip with zero body load I swear
LSD,f9s06nr,t1_f9rzxcn,1575583775.0,"I find some people trip just fine without worrying about these kind of things. But I know some people are also just prone to having anxiety over the body high, and that kills a trip sometimes. I also noticed not many people on this sub have heard of magnesium, etc. So I just wanna spread awareness so the people struggling with this can finally find a fix!"
LSD,f9rzsvt,t1_f9ryyxl,1575583620.0,"Yes, I can back that up with personal experience. The first time I tripped, my body felt great. The second time I went to a full tab and for a moment understood the overwhelming doom that seemed to almost pull me into a bad trip. From that point on I was in a viscous loop of having bad anxiety from the body sensations that convinced me I was going to die, to then getting anxiety over the fear of getting anxiety, which then worsened the body sensations to literal feelings of pain. Once I discovered hey, these supplements almost cure this problem on a trip, I then also stopped having anxiety about it which finally let me have a trip with ZERO body load, I can even prove it wasn't the acid because I had bought 4 tabs. Taken 2 one day, then 2 weeks later I took 2 more from the same batch. The first time I still felt anxious over the mild (but improved) body load. The second time I didn't even expect the body load, so there was literally no body load. I can now meditate on acid :)"
LSD,f9ryxtd,t1_f9ryfib,1575583265.0,"Because LSD is a vasoconstrictor, and for me it makes me feel itchy and makes my feet hurt when I stand. Ibuprofen is a vasodilator, and also an anti inflammatory which helps with a lot of other little pains as well. Sometimes I will also drink one beer and I'd say that's the cure for uncomfortable trips, especially if you're a person prone to getting anxious over weird sensations in your body while tripping"
LSD,f9ryk2p,t1_f9ry9jd,1575583108.0,For sure! Magnesium also would help with jaw pain on MDMA. A lot of statistics are wrong but apparently 70% of people are magnesium deficiency anyways. I take 2 pills a day and I find if you do that for about 2 weeks it improves the effect is has during tripping
LSD,f9ry96j,t1_f9rx64i,1575582985.0,"Perfect, that's about exactly what I do. My trips use to be really hard to enjoy and it caused a lot of anxiety issues for me. I realized I didn't have some sort of anxiety disorder, it was just that I didn't take care of my body enough before I tripped

Also just one beer as well and literally I have no anxiety"
LSD,f9rxugl,t1_f9rwz1n,1575582821.0,"Magnesium is great for a lot of things! Muscle tension or tightness on trips is mainly what it helps with, but I find it also soothes anxiety levels as well. I use to have very difficult trips because my body would contract and make me think I was dying. I found this and now my body actually feels good while tripping! I've noticed most people on this sub have never heard of it so I'd love to bring awareness to it incase anyone else is struggling with what I was. Make sure it's magnesium chelated though! I take 200mg at the same time I drop. 200mg at the peak, and 200 on the comedown as well!

P.s: the ibuprofen also combats the vasoconstriction which many find uncomfortable. I take 400mg at the peak, and 400mg on the comedown
The CBD oil is mainly for relaxing and to aid anxiety. It works wonders!

Say goodbye to trips where your body feels like shit and limits you from fully experiencing the trip.
Say hello to body euphoria!

Your mind and body go through a lot during a trip! Making sure you're well slept and have eaten healthy, along with little supplements like these, and your body will be thanking you!"
