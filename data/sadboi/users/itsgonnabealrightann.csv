But it’s what you needed to do in that moment to survive.” She’s not saying self harm is okay and I think we all know that it’s not, but in case you feel shame in your cuts showing (I know I still hide my scars) just remember that they got you through it.

I trusted him so much that I married him at such a young age thinking I found the one. I was convinced that he would never lie to me, that he was a religious guy and so sweet. As soon as we got married, the next day we got in our first fight. He yelled at me so loudly, 3 months later, I found drugs in his car and he had previously told me he didn’t do drugs or drink. A few weeks later I smelled alcohol on his breath, he admitted he had been drinking. Then a year later I found jewelry in his car, he said it was mine. It wasn’t mine. I divorced him about 6 months after that. What I am trying to say is, people can seem extremely trust worthy, but are not. Pay attention to this because he did lie to you, pay attention to his actions the next few weeks, lying and gaslighting (“I told you about this”) is not okay, and if you see it happening more then that tells you a lot about who they are. I would give it time, this is the first time he has lied, so give it time but pay attention to the signs."

I think it’s great that some days you feel perfectly fine and I don’t think that those days should invalidate the fact that you have these disorders because what differentiates it is that you still struggle on other days and are working through that in therapy. Therapy is for everyone, even people who never feel depressed at all. Hang in there on the bad days and appreciate the good! Sometimes I feel like I have nothing to talk about in therapy so I just tell my therapist this! “ I feel good today, so I don’t know what to talk about because I don’t feel hurt or sad” and then what she does is we use those days to dive into my past so that we can try to find the root issue of where my personal self harming started and what triggers my anxiety.

Advice,flpvu3e,t3_fq7rqu,1585370300.0,"****trigger warning, eating disorder***
I am currently struggling with a eating disorder. I have been struggling with one since 2018. I binge and purge and trust me, it has ruined my life. Developing an eating disorder was obviously not my intention but I started not not eat and it got worse and worse. I never thought I would get to a point where I can’t stop. I meet with a therapist every 2 weeks to help, but with this current quarantine I haven’t been able to. I am working so hard to get through it, so what I am saying is I was on the same boat as you, and unfortunately I did not listen to all of these red flags your mind is throwing at you. I really wish I did. What I am saying here is 1) you are not alone. I feel this way too, I am 125 pounds and I still feel the need to not eat. We know 125 is not fat, we logically know that and yet body Dysmorphia gets into our heads. I look in the mirror after a meal and see fat, but I promise you others are not seeing that. You are not ugly, you are not less than your sisters or your bfs sister or the girls on Instagram regardless of your weight. 2) you are so incredibly strong (a lot stronger than me) for noticing this early and choosing to get advice instead of giving in. That is incredible because our minds are so mean to us, and you have began to overcome the irrational thoughts our mind gives us and have chosen to try to be better. You’re awesome. I am currently struggling with this eating disorder but I have had times where I have gone a whole month without limiting or purging my food. I suggest eating healthier foods, that is how I did it, eat healthier foods but do not limit yourself. Eat healthy and then if you want a pizza on a Friday night, get a pizza. The start to eating disorders starts by telling yourself you can’t have something, when you say that your body craves it. Eating pizza for dinner one night is not going to cause you to gain weight. It’s one night, it’s one meal, enjoy it. 

Others might have better advice than be because I am still trying to figure it out, but you’re not alone. Hang in there, eat something, it’s okay to. I will do the same."
therapy,fl7u0iy,t1_fl6c32o,1584909354.0,Sorry for my long response but I hope it brings a bit more clarity! I am currently getting to know someone who is like this- only extremely affectionate in person because he is scared of how he feels (he’s told me this) you’d be surprised at how patient a girl/guy can be if they just know the truth.
therapy,fl7tx0h,t1_fl6c32o,1584909293.0,"You say that when you have been with these people that you feel a connection and can feel engaged with them. So I think that you are holding back when you aren’t and whether it’s because you’re scared of getting hurt or maybe these people truly just aren’t giving you what you need but I think it is worth a try. Open up by when you’re not with those people in person, text them, call them, put in an effort to see them. Clearly they are probably reaching out to you to see you right? Ask them out for a change, even if you don’t feel that emotional attachment when you aren’t in person giving yourself a chance to get to know them may help you feel that or at least step out of your comfort zone. Text them, ask them questions, get to know them, offer to go to their place not just yours, take them out. You might have to do this with more than one person in order to feel something but if your heart is somewhere else, you won’t let yourself love until you allow yourself to do these things. The best way to start that is to get out there and give it a chance even if it seems like it won’t go anywhere, and be honest with these people as well if you feel that they are starting to like you more. I hope that makes sense, I think that doing the motions of dating can sometimes open up your mind to dating more. Give it time if now is not the time, but I think putting in an effort outside of only in person with these people you feel a connection with in person will help you explore that connection. If you feel a connection in person, odds are you are letting your anxiety push them away when they are not around. So try it out try building a connection outside of a physical connection, send them memes. Text them asking how their day is, if you don’t like texting say “hope you had a great day, I hope I see you soon!” At the end of the night so that you don’t have to have a full conversation. Baby steps, don’t let someone get away if you feel a connection without exploring what it may be. The worst thing that can happen is they aren’t the one and you eventually find the one."

I say you have the difficult conversation of the fact that you don’t trust him and that you don’t know if you can have a kid with him and see what he says. What is going to happen when the baby is 2 and very difficult to take care of (because you’re tired ) and therefore you and your husband aren’t as close...is he going to cheat again? Probably not, but you’ll always have that fear and never feel the same way again. If you were going to forgive him I feel like you would have.

I’m no therapist but the biggest thing a therapist does is listens. I am on the same boat as you. I know what it feels like to think about ending my life all the time.. I know what it’s like to plan it..I know what it’s like to write the note. I also know what it’s like to tell myself “this is not you, this is just what your brain is making you think you want” the thing is we don’t want to die...we just want the pain to stop. I promise you the more you keep on telling yourself that it’s just a chemical imbalance in your brain it will help you in those moments to feel a little hope. By hope I don’t mean it makes me feel better but I mean it makes me think “okay, I will feel this way tonight, and tomorrow it will be better let me just make it to tomorrow”. Seems cheesy but it works for me. Even in the middle of a anxiety attack it works. If that doesn’t work for you just try to tell yourself you need to get through one more day. “The sun will set for you”. I have always interpreted that as no matter how bad of a day you have had, there will always be a new day. Hang in there. I know where you are at and we can get through this together."
Advice,fbrtxdp,t3_ee4ruh,1577046267.0,"Honestly, she is going to have to learn the hard way. You can tell her to dump him and her parents can too but she’s not going to do it until it’s her idea. I had a friend who was with a guy who was literally hitting her and we called the cops on him and she still went back to him everytime and then one day (2 years later) she decided that she deserved better and left him. She needed to make the choice on her own. This is obviously a little different due to the legal age difference but I truly think although this is wrong, she may not listen to anyone."
mentalillness,fbefas3,t3_ecqwlo,1576784518.0,"I keep telling myself the same thing. Then I think of the reality and although I have moments where I think no one would care if I died, I know they would. “You don’t know what you got until it’s gone “, people don’t know what we are going through and that’s why they haven’t checked in. They have no clue, if they did I know for a fact they would check in every single day. Let’s hang in there together. What do you say? I know you can do it. And I know I can do it, as much as we may not want to, I would like to believe it gets better. Let’s hold onto hope a little bit longer. 

Who cares if one more light goes out? Well I do."
therapy,fbciq94,t3_ecdtyu,1576724864.0,"I think you would be surprised at how supportive your parents would be if the therapist told them. In my experience in highschool I went to therapy and they never told my parents what had happened that made me so depressed (I was being bullied very badly at school) they never told my parents about the self harm. My parents did find out about my self harm which is why they put me in therapy but after I started my parents went back to not knowing anything and my mom did ask my therapist many times what might have caused me to start self harming but she always told her she couldn’t break patient confidentiality. When my parents found out all they said was “Demi Lovato is also going through this, you’re not alone and well get you help”. Demi was in the news at that time after her self harm cuts showed in a photo. It was kind of comforting. In case someone hasn’t told you, you’re not alone. I am still battling it myself."

Advice,fb2y82o,t1_fb2xsch,1576459998.0,That’s a good call. My last message to him was if they do leave today we should do something at night and he hasn’t responded. I think I can get the hint if he doesn’t.

relationships,fa99k5q,t3_e83y07,1575866120.0,"That is so immature of him to do. He is 23 he needs to grow the hell up, alone. He broke your trust. Sex is something soo intimate and requires a lot of trust and he broke that. I would leave him and not forgive him. If he’s saying he didn’t know it was wrong then he’s stupid and is too immature to respect a woman enough to be in a intimate relationship. He was laughing with his friends as if it was a joke when it’s supposed to be sexy and be something fun you two do to spice things up. I am not trying to be negative- so forgive him if you’d like. But I think you deserve someone who will respect you and the boundaries that sex should automatically bring. You don’t want a man who kisses and tells unless you both agree that it’s okay to do so."
Advice,fa958z2,t1_fa941os,1575862774.0,"That’s a great way to put it, thank you. I am worried he will automatically know who told them what due to me being most likely the only person who has had a negative experience with him, I assume the other people they are interviewing are family and or friends."
Advice,fa956l0,t1_fa927cj,1575862724.0,Thank you for your advice. For some reason since it’s the government and intimidating I didn’t even think of the fact that I don’t have to speak if I don’t want to.
therapy,fa90ccy,t3_e7via7,1575859162.0,"My ex husband treated me horribly when we were fighting. He would say awful things and then wake up the next morning and act like nothing happened. I didn’t call it abuse either until someone described it as abuse and that opened my eyes and made me realize how awful he was. I was crying almost every night, and he would tell me to shut up or he will sleep in another room so he doesn’t hear me cry. I don’t think it’s normal to fight so much especially if he puts you down. Couples can fight and will right but there’s a difference between fighting and emotionally trying to hurt you."

Anxiety,f94vmvt,t1_f94vg64,1575105870.0,Just saying he didn’t in that moment. I said nevermind then it’s fine and he just said alright and kept doing what he was doing. Which like I know I said to forget it but I wouldn’t shrug something off that quickly you know? Now I am just sitting on the couch and probably just going to bed because I don’t even want to talk because my anxiety is so high after that.

therapy,f945zeq,t3_e3of8j,1575078364.0,"In my experience as a girl with a lot of guy friends, I feel like it’s so easy for a guy to fall for the nice girls because if they don’t like you from the start and have the intention of only being friends with you then they are unapologetically themselves and they aren’t hiding who they truly are. I think that’s why it’s so easy to fall for someone who is a friend because you see the real them, they aren’t hiding who they are in fears of you not liking them. They don’t care. I don’t think this is a problem with you. I just think you’re probably a friendly person and fall for people quickly which there is nothing wrong with that. I wouldn’t say it’s a problem with you, I just think although guys and girls can be friends it can be tricky because one usually ends up falling for the other and realizing it’s just friendship. Cherish those friendships they are usually more fun than a relationship anyways."
mentalillness,f94516l,t1_f937kor,1575077559.0,"I agree with this. Your family might think they are “helping”. My mom tells my sister this all of the time and she Will tell me that she only tells my sister to help her because she wants her to be healthy. My sister of course gets offended (as she should, saying anything about anyone’s weight is fucking rude). My mom didn’t realize that it was hurting her because in her mind it was innocent-she wasn’t calling her ugly she was just saying she should be healthier. Now my mom watches what she says now that she knows that it was hurting her. I’m really sorry you have to deal with that, I have no doubts you are beautiful and I promise other people think that as well."
mentalillness,f8i4ue2,t3_e0otrn,1574584142.0,I understand what you are going through. I promise you that you are noticed and people do care about you. People don’t know you’re hurting if you don’t tell them. I get really depressed all of the time thinking no one cares about me but if they knew they would probably reach out more and prove that they care. I would never tell them how I feel but I promise you someone cares. I care. Let’s stay strong together.
mentalillness,f8i4mvq,t3_e0ua2q,1574584034.0,I think therapy can help. Everytime it gets too far I see a therapist and it always helps. Just be open with them or else it won’t help you. Sometimes saying it out loud Is what you need to cope.
mentalillness,f8i4k5v,t3_e0ua2q,1574583994.0,I feel the same way. I sometimes feel so alone that my friends around me have no idea and I feel like just ending my life because then they will see that I was hurting..that I wasn’t the happy person I appear to be. I hope that changes some day because always wanting to die is miserable. But I don’t want to die. I hope you stay strong because I know we can both get through this. Hang in there.
Advice,f7v466d,t3_dxiew9,1574020506.0,"I would like to ask you this: did you learn something from him? How to love? How to hate now that it’s over? How to open up to someone? How to trust someone? How to have fun? If you learned anything from that relationship and are a better person because of it then you are right where you need to be. Breakups are hard and I don’t want to discredit that, take your time to cry, sob, be angry, and then accept it when you’re ready, you don’t have to do that right away. If you grew as  a person because of this then it is not lost or wasted time. It was a time of growth for you and this break up will also help you grow. You are so much stronger than you think. You think you can’t get through this, you already are and you are kicking ass at getting through this. Hang in there, message me if you need someone to talk to, I went through a divorce at the beginning of the year (as a 22 y/o) and I know how scary starting over can be. Stay strong!"
