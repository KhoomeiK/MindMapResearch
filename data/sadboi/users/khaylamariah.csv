AskReddit,fj6zoff,t3_fbaug5,1583083452.0,It was my first day at a new school in 5th grade and I went to go to the bathroom but I got lost on my way back. I basically went in a circle about three times because I had no idea where I was going and this teacher comes out of her classroom and starts screaming at me because i’m “playing in the hallways instead of going back to class” and when I tried to explain that it was my first day and I was lost she screamed at me some more and told me to get back to my class.
