MyChemicalRomance,f60ondd,t3_dq5s20,1572622384.0,I hope so but Iâ€™m not sure. I think it would make sense for them to go on a tour but Iâ€™m not 100% sure.
SuicideWatch,f3tk6eh,t3_dhzrdx,1571137552.0,Yea I think thatâ€™s a great idea! But you have to make sure your willing to take of it no matter what.

Blink182,f0dh0x7,t3_d4gnw9,1568554042.0,"I will admit Iâ€™ve been a fan since California but Iâ€™m only 12 so I didnâ€™t even really know blink existed for a long time. My parents never exposed me to them either but the past few years Iâ€™ve completely changed my taste in music. There are so many great bands like blink out there that are so underrated by kids my age. Iâ€™m probably one of the only 12 year olds that doesnâ€™t listen to mainstream pop music but in fact rock, punk, alternative and a bunch of other genres!"

Blink182,eysptlt,t3_cyf0gf,1567407714.0,Thanks for posting this! I really want to see them live but my parents wonâ€™t take me sadly so this is the closest I have to seeing live!
Blink182,eyspoac,t3_cyfqn7,1567407522.0,Iâ€™m a lot younger than everyone in the video and I was very surprised but the reactions the people had. Yes the word angsty was used a lot  along with a bunch of other kind of annoying slang but in the end the people had positive things to say. The people Iâ€™m surrounded by at my school would say absolutely nothing like this because they donâ€™t know what good music really is but I guess this was cool to see that people on the younger side had positive things to say about blink!
selfharm,eyoeow0,t1_eyncc9y,1567275707.0,Ok TYSM
selfharm,eymmka9,t1_eym60kn,1567213459.0,Thank you
selfharm,eymmjue,t1_eym477w,1567213448.0,Than you. May I ask what type of makeup you use? I donâ€™t use makeup very often so Iâ€™m not very good with all that stuff.

Blink182,eyl3ylr,t3_cxbk77,1567175630.0,"Iâ€™m not really sure I think the video was fine it was supposed to be funny and a joke and everyone hates it which sucks. Blink really isnâ€™t that bad, maybe there not the same but there stuff it still good just different."
Blink182,ey9uuzb,t3_cw916h,1566953027.0,Does anyone know what time itâ€™s being released?
Blink182,ey72dgi,t3_cvv9q9,1566869952.0,Adams song and stay together for the kids

depression,exex5md,t1_exew1cv,1566227495.0,Yes
depression,exe6ebx,t1_exduh4l,1566200638.0,No not really but I donâ€™t think my parents would let me see a psychiatrist and they defiantly would not let me take antidepressants even though that would probably help. They donâ€™t even notice that Iâ€™m like this
depression,exe6bsp,t1_exe55zh,1566200538.0,Uh idk the answers to your questions
depression,exdtbof,t1_exdssf0,1566186087.0,Ofc :) just try your best to get through this and itâ€™ll all be ok
depression,exdt2vx,t3_cs9w0v,1566185876.0,For me Iâ€™ve been depressed for as long as I have good memories of which would be around 1st or 2nd grade so I was like 8 or 9 I think and now Iâ€™m 12 soon to be 13 and Iâ€™m stuck this way
depression,exdssfw,t3_csayta,1566185627.0,Hey im also 12 years old and going into 7th grade and I feel the same. I want to end it all and Iâ€™m miserable. Life just fucking sucks and Iâ€™m also extremely anxious in school but just in general too. And you know whatâ€™s fucked up? Thereâ€™s this person I used to be friends with(I donâ€™t want to consider her my friend anymore)  and she tells me about how she pretend to have anxiety and panic attackâ€™s to skip school and stay home with her parents and it sucks. Life sucks and I want to cut too. I had a relapse the other night and I thought I needed stitches at first but I think itâ€™s ok. So life sucks but I hope when you see this you feel a little less alone because I know what your going through and if you ever need anything or want to be friends you can message me and we can get through this life together
depression,exds5eq,t3_csbc5y,1566185098.0,"Please donâ€™t kill your self. I know life can really fucking suck but you can get help. I know it can be hard to talk to people but they can help. But you can also just try and distract yourself by doing art (drawing, painting) or play video games to distract yourself. Or maybe listen to music. Anything that can distract you from your thoughts can help just please donâ€™t end your life or hurt yourself"

selfharm,esdv9qs,t3_c77sr5,1561869913.0,I have a long sleeve swim shirt for when I go swimming and it hides my cuts and scars pretty well. Idk If that helps but thatâ€™s what I do.
selfharm,erotsyc,t3_c35iua,1561088535.0,Iâ€™ve never cut words into me but there was a point in time when I would fight the urge to cut but taking a pen or pencil and carving the words into my skin.
