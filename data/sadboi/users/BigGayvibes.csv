actuallesbians,ffo6dgu,t3_ckvwxq,1580074572.0,"I have a naturally deep voice and even though it took me some time to accept it, now I am basically comfortable with it. My voice has made people mistake me for a guy over calls, which did make me feel bad for some time. I did get made fun of for my voice at various points in my life, but I eventually learned that those people were just saying whatever they could to tear me down. 

Anyway, as a lot of the women here have said, people find girls with deeper voices hot. I remember feeling so insecure about my voice until I came to this sub. Seeing that there’s other girls that actually like deep voices and don’t see that as weird really helped my self esteem. I like deep voices on other women too, I think it’s attractive."

She’s trying to spin me in circles and keep me tied to her, but I’m trying my best to avoid it. I need to keep in mind that there’s someone out there who will treat me right and respect me for who I am."
depression,f7ci1ai,t1_f7b0vl5,1573592696.0,"Yeah they think that since I’m usually smiling and cracking jokes, I’m completely fine. People around me don’t really try to go out of their way to see behind that persona."
depression,f6kjani,t3_dk44jz,1572913262.0,"This really does resonate with me. I always try to help others before myself and then I end up prioritizing their problems over mine. Then, I just neglect my own feelings and let it bottle up inside without venting to anyone because I think that they would see me as a burden or they wouldn’t take me seriously."
depression,f6kig2m,t3_dpl4bu,1572912859.0,"I relate to this so much, people around me are so unaware of how I actually feel. They just assume that because it seems like everything is fine, I don’t have any problems or troubles in my life. I still come home and break down though, just not in front of anybody else. I’ve been living in this cycle of negativity for awhile now and I don’t have too many people who would take me seriously."
actuallesbians,f5gq7lj,t3_dnqs05,1572195956.0,"I definitely relate to this feeling. I’m 17 right now, never been in a relationship and still closeted basically. I struggle with lots of self hatred and self esteem issues so it’s been hard for me to get myself out there and talk to people. Most of the time I feel like I’ll never find love and I’ll just be lonely for the rest of my life, but I really try to have some kind of hope that everything turns out okay in the end. I cling to the thought that everything will turn out fine in the end because I know if I become completely hopeless, I’ll get really messed up. I hope that the both of us and everyone else here who relates finds someone to love and support them."

actuallesbians,f3hyxbr,t3_dh2o4u,1570930282.0,"God, I hate this so much. I came out to some of my friends and eventually it reached this one girl who started viewing me differently because she thought I would be attracted to her even though I’ve never seen her like that. She started getting uncomfortable around me even though I’ve never expressed interest in her. Moments like these hold me back from even coming out because I don’t want to have to keep explaining myself and keep getting these assumptions."
actuallesbians,f1w6qyi,t1_f1vpr6j,1569780981.0,"I really needed this thank you so much. There’s been this voice in my head for awhile that’s been telling me that I am not enough and that I am too ugly to be loved. It’s been going on for years and years and I’ve really been stuck in this, but hearing your response along with others manage to give me some comfort that things will eventually be okay. I hope I do find someone who will love me for who I am :)"
