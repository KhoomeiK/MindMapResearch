I am head over heals for my roommate I moved in with just over a year ago. I don't want to like him. It just makes life complicated. But after trying to move on for the last couple months, I've reached a point of acceptance. 

I'm not going to tell him. I've decided to wait for him to get into a relationship so I can move on knowing he's not available. In the meantime I'm just going to be secretly staring at his ass and trying to spend time with him as a good friend. 

Pray for me."
