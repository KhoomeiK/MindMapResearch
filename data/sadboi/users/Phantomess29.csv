piano,ffqul53,t1_ffqsjut,1580143990.0,"> I took a long break from the piano during college after playing daily for most of my childhood and teens.

Same!

> I started back in earnest a couple years ago and what I‚Äôve found to work best is a good mix of doing the ‚Äúmeat&potatoes‚Äù type stuff like Hanon, scales, Czerny, etc to build your muscles and get your technical skills back 

Yes, actually, that's what I'm doing. Hanon and scales is what I'm doing, but I reckon I should revisit Czerny as well.

Thank you for the kind advice. I will keep them in mind!"
