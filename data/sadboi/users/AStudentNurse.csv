Advice,fk06wcg,t3_ffnfqu,1583744736.0,"Feeling the exact same way lately. Struggling with suicidal thoughts and I just don't see the point in anything.

I've been seeing a therapist recently. I've definitely found it quite helpful because it gives me an opportunity to open up and be completely honest with someone. Recommend you to see a therapist if you haven't already.  However, it's difficult to have the motivation to see one if you're feeling so depressed. I used to think to myself ""why should I bother? I'm going to kill myself soon anyway"". Feeling that way was awful. 

Right now, just focus on getting small things done. You and I both know that depression makes it difficult to even do the simplest things - getting out of bed, eating, showering, and other everyday activities."

Really sorry that happened to you - you deserve to be given the best care you possibly can. Nothing can justify the lack of compassion that nurse had towards you. 

Your feelings are valid and deserve to be taken seriously by healthcare professionals.

How are you feeling now?"
