ptsd,fr6l1cj,t3_gmvx7g,1589928216.0,"I think it’s about coping and control. Like, hey, everything is fucked up and everything hurts- but I have the end all, I reserve the final word. I have the control here by having the option to kill myself.

Now that I’m on medication and I feel better, I still think it. But because I’m still learning better coping mechanism to replace this one that was so powerful.

A quote I think about a lot is from a poem by Neil Hilborn “I think about killing myself a lot. Not like a point on a map, but like a glowing exit sign at a show that’s never been quite bad enough to make me want to leave”"

I’m glad to know other people are feeling this way too and we’re not alone

Edit for grammatical errors."
ptsd,fk2hnyz,t3_fg3vqd,1583801283.0,"I was also misdiagnosed with bipolar.

And I also share the experience of feeling as though my traumas were not affecting me to the level of severity I associate with ptsd.
But now that I’ve been living with the diagnosis and have been able to digest it, it makes so much more sense than bipolar. 

Apparently, according to my care team, this misdiagnosis is fairly common.

Of course I can’t speak to your experience, but for me I now realize my trauma didn’t seem like it affected me because it was ingrained into all of my behavior and thinking patterns. Everything I do can be tied back to trauma. So it never seemed that bad cause it was just life for me. Which in itself was hard to cope with, but it’s getting easier."
adhd_anxiety,fjtslap,t3_fewluw,1583610579.0,"I’m on these two and I have honestly never felt more normal in my entire life.

My sex drive did a nosedive the first few months of Lex, and my appetite was wonky for a while but both have since returned to normal. I even feel like my ADHD is more manageable on a day to day basis, but it’s still a struggle.

It’s like, incredible. I feel so much better it’s crazy.  

If you go this route, I hope it works well for you!"
ptsd,fizdhse,t3_famvmt,1582860080.0,"It really sounds as though they’re projecting their own struggles upon you. You owe this person exactly nothing. They are there to provide a service for you- if you feel uncomfortable, you should not feel guilty about finding a new provider. There is no repercussions, they legally cannot divulge anything you all have talked about.
You should find someone with the motherly vibe you are looking for! You deserve that comfort!"
Target,faqem1p,t3_eaf666,1576301971.0,"Definitely talk with your HR ETL. They were harassing you and that’s not okay. You probably aren’t the only person they have made uncomfortable, also.
That person may also not understand that they’re behavior is making others uncomfortable, so a conversation between them and leadership is necessary so that you and others feel safe in your workspace.
I hope things get better!"
ptsd,f4pblwj,t3_dlapeg,1571722833.0,"It can be a comforting thought amongst the chaos. But you’re absolutely Not better off dead. It doesn’t really help anything and the world needs all the good and loving people it can get. So I hope you are able to talk with your counselor about the ideation. I hope y’all can work out a plan on how to deal with those thoughts on your own

Anecdotal, but my counselors had me do this and I have it written in a few places around my apartment. It has helped when I can’t seem to get those thoughts out of my head.

Be well- we’re rooting for you."
