Cooking,fplbat4,t3_gdns8w,1588709647.0,"Definitely need ingredients on blends - I won't buy it if I don't know what's in it. And do you make your own blends? If so, that would be something to highlight, especially for blends unique to your shop. 

Recipes are great, but PLEASE don't do the huge essay-style recipes. You can also put simple recipes on notecards and include them with sales. 

I really like the bigger thumbnail photos. Definitely invest in photography. The colors and depth-of-field are a little wacky.

Discount on multiple gift boxes for the holidays?

Check out Savory Spice Shop in Colorado for ideas. They named many of their own blends after locations in Colorado, which helps people remember the company and what they need to refill. On the individual spice pages, they show both volume and weight for each purchase option with helpful icons. I'm not saying to straight-up copy, but they have been very successful. (I switched to them from Penzey's in 2007.)

Best of luck!!"

1. Document everything - photos, paperwork, whatever you can find. Store digital copies in multiple cloud storage sites and give the password info for each one to a different person. Take physical copies to a lawyer.

2. Get as much money as you can, pick a random city, buy a plane ticket, and leave before the baby is born. Tell only your mom and a lawyer where you are. Lawyer can coordinate with police, I think.

3. See if there's a suicide clause in the life insurance. If not, they may be able to fake your death as postpartum depression suicide and still get money.

No amount of therapy will EVER fix this. The only thing that matters now is the safety of you and your child.

Godspeed."
