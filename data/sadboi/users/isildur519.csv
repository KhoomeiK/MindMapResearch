I won‚Äôt lie and say I‚Äôm NOT cross addicting, but honestly? It‚Äôs a whole hell of a lot better than being an alcoholic. It‚Äôs an expensive habit, but not a life ruining one imo. And it did help me quit drinking.

1. Ask her what she needs, preferably before anything happens, not during. It‚Äôs tough to work out what I need when I‚Äôm in the midst of things. For me, I either need space where no ones touching me or a big hug. 

2. Listen. If she needs to stop in the middle of sex, don‚Äôt argue. I know it sucks, and it‚Äôs a total mood killer, but it‚Äôs really important. 

3. Check in, even if it feels weird. If you feel like something‚Äôs off, ask her if everything‚Äôs ok. Even if you‚Äôre in the middle of things. If she‚Äôs ok, nothing bads gonna happen from that. 

Sounds like you‚Äôre really trying to be there. Good job."

Sounds like your relationship is ending because your girlfriend is not quite mature enough to be in a relationship with you yet.

I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôll happen with Beverley, but I think this assertion you‚Äôve made in the comments that you can tell immediately whether you‚Äôll fall in love with someone is wrong.

First, if you‚Äôre on meds the alcohol can interact w them in really bad ways (like making you feel way drunker way faster, making the meds not as effective). 

Second, alcohol combined with the impulsiveness/lowered inhibitions of mania/hypomania can be a really dangerous combo. 

Third, it‚Äôs a depressant, which combined with depressive episodes can be really really brutal, especially the morning after.
