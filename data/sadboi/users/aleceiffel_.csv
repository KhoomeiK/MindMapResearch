AskAstrologers,fi60fff,t1_fi2tgrj,1582175127.0,"I said this as a joke. But truth:

For me, and I speak for no other 12th house Venusians, this placement has given me the gift of reading people. Seeing hidden agendas clearly - a knowing that's rarely inaccurate. 

It also makes me shy in terms of love. In my youth, my relationships were secret, hidden, with men who'd yet to come out or needed to stow me away for whatever reason.

As a child I was largely ignored. I once believed that I had to suffer for true love, and that it would not be given to me freely.

As an adult post Saturn return and having experienced both Pluto and Saturn transit my natal moon:

I love very deeply but with freedom. I do not accept secret relationships or affairs. I've accepted my place in my family, healed that trauma and moved into a more sustainable foundation. I can still read people fairly quickly and can be shy approaching interests if I'm unsure of how they feel.

Tho, I will say because I'm a few years past mine, it's probably going to be hard but if you do Saturn's work, he will pay you handsomely. My return was an introduction to Pluto and Saturn transiting my fourth house of Capricorn. When he went retrograde last year, he went over my natal moon/Mars conjunction three times. Shit got really real. 

He will expect quality work with no feedback but, if you accept his offer, he will reward you in ways that ground you and solidify your life in a new way.
