Advice,fosamzs,t1_fosac8b,1588027022.0,Yeah I'm definitely going to run it by him tomorrow. I was thinking when we're packing I'll try to put all of my stuff in his car tomorrow and ask if he can take me to my aunt's. Still not sure how to tell my mom I won't be coming back but I hope it works well enough
Advice,fosa59o,t1_fos9tri,1588026754.0,"When it's just us two, he's supportive. And he supports my decision of going off to college out of state. But, when it involves me and my mom he kind of has this ""shut up and be quiet"" attitude in hopes that she'll stop yelling. So he's not much help"
Advice,fos99tc,t3_g9awau,1588026302.0,I feel like this post is all over the place but so is my braid haha. sorry guys. Just really need some advice on how to go about this :(
lonely,foieiyb,t1_foiaedz,1587784800.0,"That's really funny that you say that, i had a friend read my birth chart yesterday and she mentioned the exact thing. quoted ""these placements are generally appreciative of even the minor details that make things beautiful... Venus is in charge of Music art poetry just think of renaissance. And with it so close to ur sun and moon all in capricorn, think of urself as like a renaissance person literally a living art piece""

It's comforting to heart something similar 2 days in a row :)"
lonely,fohzule,t3_g7a0oz,1587775868.0,"thank you this is really beautiful. It reminds me of some lyrics by willow smith when she says ""but we are from Nibiru, remember your cosmic roots."""
dating,fodsqbp,t1_fob9jou,1587689424.0,damn dude
dating,fodsf2r,t1_foa05q7,1587689259.0,i agree 1000%
depression,focqcll,t3_g6jgq0,1587674472.0,"This!!! I've never really taken the time to think about it. But my depression started out this way! I was always trying so hard to Not be depressed or trying to mask it in a way because I didn't want my mood to affect others. It got so draining after so many months that i just sort of let myself drown in what I was really feeling. I got tired of pretending and just accepted the fact that I was depressed and didn't wanna do anything about it. And I do think that's why sometimes some cases of depression is overlooked. Some of us are trying so hard to ""fit in"" with our surroundings or to do anything to avoid being stuck in our heads and it's draining."
dating,fo9970g,t1_fo98wq0,1587613492.0,"yup! i feel like i'm the only one who really does this?? like i'll reply this way and then i get nothing in return so i just let the conversation die. because who wants to reply to ""cool"""
lonely,fo8rpwl,t1_fo8r1pv,1587602466.0,i know right??
lonely,fo8qudc,t3_g6atrf,1587601963.0,"this feeling definitely intensified after i watched perks of being a wildflower lol. just wish i had friends that i had something in common with, we could all hand out and enjoy ourselves"
lonely,fnt5o24,t1_fnt58vk,1587235091.0,yup! in the same boat as you. just feels one sided at this point
lonely,fnt58ma,t1_fnsyrz1,1587234858.0,I agree! And it's good you cut him off. Some people view it as a bad thing when you've known someone for so long and suddenly it's just.. done. but things aren't forever and time isn't everything. you'll meet another good friend or two and hopefully they'll last a lifetime. we all deserve at least 1 good friend
lonely,fnt4n1q,t1_fnsjaqz,1587234530.0,"I'm really sorry you had to go through that, that we have to go through that. And i'm going through something similar. We all get along really well and of course there's a few of us that get along better/talk to each other outside of the gc but I do often feel like i'm trying too hard to continue being their friend. Or that when i have something important to say they don't really respond to me how they woukd to another person who had something to say. just small things that i notice. I do think they care about me but i don't feel like i mean as much as anyone else in our friend group and it sucks. Friendship shouldn't feel like a chore and you shouldn't have to walk on eggshells or be uncomfortable about something all the time. I'm glad we could talk about this and you can always message me anytime!"
lonely,fnt4053,t1_fnsfl0l,1587234182.0,ohh that sounds good! do you know anyone else that'd be up for that?
lonely,fnt2wzv,t1_fns508k,1587233587.0,"thank you so much. It really doesn't feel good to feel like this all the time but i know better things and people are in store for me, so i try not to get so down about it

you didn't come off as weird and i'll be messaging you soon :)"
lonely,fnt2kkk,t1_fns1h0i,1587233398.0,i don't think that's true. I often feel like people might not wanna talk to me either but i know that they care deep down. maybe it's something on their end and they're too afraid to/don't know how to talk to you. or maybe it's one of those situations where you just have to be the one who reaches out first
lonely,fnrvakj,t1_fnrv38d,1587202930.0,"yup! i've had a few jobs in the last few years and there's been a few coworkers that i've liked but it never really turned into an outside of work friendship. more of a ""hey i'm at work let me talk to these guys to kill time and remember what it feels like to communicate"" lol"
lonely,fnrt5sj,t1_fnrr4h8,1587200594.0,i'm always down to talk though!
lonely,fnrt57x,t1_fnrr4h8,1587200577.0,it sucks!! we'll find good people for us eventually
AmItheAsshole,fnrp56s,t1_fnrlvzf,1587196400.0,thank you i'll definitely show this to her
AmItheAsshole,fnrmyvq,t1_fnrmkpd,1587194217.0,It's fentanyl sorry for not clarifying. Didn't want my friend to find this post and know it was about her if i named the drug but i've already said the entire story at this point lol
AmItheAsshole,fnrmlwr,t1_fnrma0u,1587193863.0,"You're right and i thank you. I'd just feel bad letting the last few years go to waste, but again we're young and I have so many more people to meet in life. why not start weeding out the ""bad"" ones now. I love them but most of the time I don't really feel like i belong in our small friend group and it stresses me out. I don't wanna have that talk with them and i don't like being annoyed with them and then explaining why i feel that way. just a big stress ball right now"
AmItheAsshole,fnrlcxg,t1_fnrkr0f,1587192663.0,"yeah and that's how i think! i'm always thinking about not just myself but my future. and these are people i would like to be long term friends, longer than the 3 years we've known each other. but i know who i want in my life and the people i wanna be surrounded by and they're just... i get it we're young and in/heading to college and they wanna have fun and shit but there's so many other things you could do and to carry that stress with me wondering if they're okay.. i'd rather just find some new friends"
AmItheAsshole,fnrkgay,t1_fnrk0g5,1587191808.0,no she tweeted on her private account that she doesn't wanna experience anything sober because she's been going through tough times
AmItheAsshole,fnrkb8a,t1_fnrjl6r,1587191673.0,"no i completely agree! i hate seeming like a prude or ""lame"" but any form of a drug just pisses me off idk why"
AmItheAsshole,fnrhbrm,t1_fnrfy0r,1587188956.0,"Thank you so much. I always feel like i'm overstepping a boundary when i try to help out with her, or that she doesn't really take what i say into consideration. I'm 18 and she's almost 20 and we're both not really ""in"" school so it'd be hard to contact someone at her college. We live in different states and i don't have her parents' phone numbers, so that's also a bit of a struggle. I'll definitely try to come up with something to say to her in a little bit when i text her. I do care about her and i'm trying not to be upset about it. I do know her address in case of an emergency but Id want to talk to her so it never has to come to that. Thank you again for helping me see this a little more clearly"
lonely,fnr9gf3,t1_fnr6f9w,1587182628.0,yup! or when YOU have to reach out because the other person refuses to. feels like the friendship is a chore and it sucks
lonely,fnqxx3r,t1_fnqrpoz,1587174652.0,yeah i definitely get that! and it's not even that they're not open to having a conversation because we have a groupchat that's been pretty active since we became friends but sometimes i feel a little left out or i notice behaviors in them that make me feel uncomfortable/annoyed and i'd rather not feel that way so i just keep my distance.
lonely,fnqo7j4,t1_fnqcicf,1587168597.0,same here!!
lonely,fnqn6jk,t3_g33eo5,1587167996.0,"I wish that were my situation. I think i'm so bored i don't even have the energy to cum every time i try i'm just like ""eh never mind i don't really feel like it"""
