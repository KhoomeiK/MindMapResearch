Time‚ÄîAs soon as you notice what‚Äôs up, grab your phone and start a timer. Over 5 minutes of seizing, call 911. Most seizures do not last that long so even if you know the person/know they have seizures, call. 

Identity‚ÄîIf you don‚Äôt know the person who is seizing, see if anyone with them does or check pockets, wrist (medical alert bracelet), etc. for any ID. 

Over‚ÄîWhen the seizure is over, turn the person on their side and stay with them. They will probably try to get up as soon as they start coming out of the seizure, it‚Äôs an innate reaction, DO NOT LET THEM. Chill with them and wait several more minutes. 

Never‚ÄîWhen someone is seizing NEVER restrain them, put anything in their mouth (this includes your finger‚Äîit can be bitten off!), or give them any food/drink/medication. 

Call emergency services if:

-You know the person has never had a seizure before
-Seizure lasts for more than 5 minutes

Things happened gradually as I started taking it and increasing dosage but I recently began tapering off per my psych and the effects which had been slowly building for months now were extremely obvious as they went away quickly. 

I craved sugar like a madman. I was already an impulsive eater and overweight, but this was completely foreign to me. I was a salty/savory person before who enjoyed an occasional candy bar or slice of cake. On Trintellix I would buy Costco sized boxes of Oatmeal Creme Pies, those shitty sugar cookies with the frosting, Hershey pies, and such. They would be gone within DAYS. I was chain-eating this shit the way some folks chain-smoke. The pandemic didn‚Äôt help this at all. I gained 50-75lbs in a few months. I feel absolutely disgusting and I can only hope the weight goes down as I get off this med. When I dropped from 10mg to 5mg, the sugar cravings literally disappeared overnight. Now I want sugar intermittently the same way as I did before. 

Narcolepsy symptoms. If you don‚Äôt actually have narcolepsy, you get an appropriate amount of REM sleep. If you take an antidepressant that messes with serotonin, it reduces the amount of REM you get. Having a deficit of REM causes similar symptoms to narcolepsy (getting too much REM). Any time I sat down to do something that didn‚Äôt involve physically moving around‚Äîall of my tasks at work, pandemic hobbies like gaming, writing, crafting, etc.‚ÄîI would begin to experience microsleeps where my eyelids would become heavy and suddenly I found myself jerking back awake after nearly falling asleep completely. I could be writing a Reddit comment like this and having it happen 10-20 times before I finished. I became better at noticing and either shaking myself awake a bunch of times until I could get up and move around to stop the cycle. It would be worse if I didn‚Äôt sleep enough the night before but I could literally sleep for 8-10 hours at night and still have these attacks. Right now on 5mg it is still happening but much less frequently.

Edit: I almost forgot...they do list ‚Äònausea‚Äô as a side effect for this med. Taking it an hour ago reminded me: What they call ‚Äònausea‚Äô I call ‚Äòprojectile vomiting within 10 minutes of taking this medication if you don‚Äôt take it close to falling asleep, no matter where you happen to be located‚Äô.

From the Wikipedia article on internment:

‚ÄúPresident Jimmy Carter opened an investigation to determine whether the decision to put Japanese Americans into concentration camps had been justified by the government. He appointed the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) to investigate the camps. The Commission's report, titled Personal Justice Denied, found little evidence of Japanese disloyalty at the time and concluded that the incarceration had been the product of racism. It recommended that the government pay reparations to the internees. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 which apologized for the internment on behalf of the U.S. government and authorized a payment of $20,000 (equivalent to $43,000 in 2019) to each camp survivor.

IKEA,fpt2h3r,t3_gf8jcm,1588883713.0,"Welp, glad I‚Äôm not buying our new couch from there like I thought I would. 

(LoveSac is doing 40% off for healthcare/first responders. Maybe 2x the price of IKEA after discount depending on what you want, but lifetime warranty and the company seems to be a lot less shitty to their people!)"
AnimalCrossingHangOut,fpspbnn,t3_gf5v59,1588877324.0,I finally gave up on winging it and drew out a shitty version of my map. Still probs not gonna be as cool as everyone else‚Äôs but at least I figured out how close I could put houses.
nursing,fprving,t1_fpr1crj,1588862843.0,"Yep. I‚Äôm not in a city with huge OD rates (at least I don‚Äôt believe I am) but through my insurer I was able to get free Narcan at a Walgreens. The pharmacist is able to write the script for you. 

Funnily enough, it was for my dog who was having a very weird reaction to Dilaudid after a broken toe/ER vet visit...we kept it on hand but didn‚Äôt have to use it, thank goodness. Now it‚Äôs sitting on a shelf by my door god forbid I need it for a fellow human. :)"
battlestations,fpro63q,t1_fprbbm8,1588858690.0,This one was the only one on Amazon under $100 with 5-star reviews from people who‚Äôve had it for years. For someone with a lot less income due to the pandemic I can‚Äôt complain ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

antidepressants,fpq0z1v,t3_geovox,1588812998.0,"I feel this. Medicated for ADHD but even amphetamines aren‚Äôt touching anything. I‚Äôm hoping to switch to Ritalin soon. It sucks knowing that the docs all want to treat my depression by fucking with serotonin, which messes with my body in horrible ways, when all of my biggest issues (impulsivity, executive dysfunction, spending/eating addiction) are obviously due to needing dopamine."

relationship_advice,fphwl8t,t1_fox9igf,1588629142.0,"Yes, this. Him telling her she‚Äôs being too sensitive is gaslighting. Making her question her own completely rational response in order to make her feel like SHE did something wrong when he clearly was the one who did. Disgusts me. :("

WayOfTheBern,fpgn4ye,t1_fpgmxxj,1588605905.0,None of what we do in the voting booth has much meaning. What we do to pressure lawmakers after does. You want someone at the top who is going to sign those bills we get pushed through. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

WayOfTheBern,fpgls4a,t1_fpglgwz,1588605178.0,Tell me how letting Trump win allows for any of Bernie‚Äôs policies to have a chance of being implemented?
WayOfTheBern,fpgkqnm,t3_gd90ty,1588604612.0,"I am a survivor and it‚Äôs bullshit to suggest we don‚Äôt vote for him. We have no choice right now. Trump is a r*pist AND an imbecile capable of ruining our country further by appointing more SCOTUS judges. Third party? Yeah, right. That‚Äôs a vote for Trump. Biden is going to pick a VP that will likely serve as regent for him in his mental
decline. That‚Äôs the ONLY shot we have at getting anything fixed. 

Do I hate the man? Absolutely. Will I plug my nose, close my eyes, and vote for him? You bet your goddamn ass I will."
