LibbyandAbby,fqytvnz,t1_fqyppp9,1589754471.0,"My thought regarding arguing guy not noticing wet jeans is that maybe they just got wet a couple inches up and or the sun cast shadows on bg as he walked by arguing guy the same as it did on the bridge casting some dark shadows on him including his jeans. The shadows would serve to cover up or camoflauge wet areas of the jeans I would think. heres a link to shadows on bgs jeans when on the bridge. https://www.wowo.com/police-return-delphi-murder-investigation/


My guess about arguing woman not seeing bg is that she was doing most of the arguing whereas arguing guy was letting her talk and he was paying more attention to his surroundings and less to what was being said to him.  I feel arguing guys and sixteen year old girls accounts support each other.


Young guy sketch being an entirely different person than who sixteen year old girl and arguing guy saw makes no sense to me."

Down can mean something like down the road, which means just a distance away or it can be more like downstairs or even down the hill which means beneath or at a lower elevation."
LibbyandAbby,fqx7kif,t1_fqwa7bh,1589727540.0,"Your comment raises some excellent points. One thing I would like to add is how easy it can be to appear suspicious to another person. If a person in their car ever stops in front of someones house to use their phone, consult their directions, open a water bottle, take an aspirin, adjust their glasses, pick up something that had fallen on the car floor it seems like nine times out of ten the homeowners see and stand at their living room window staring at the driver until they leave.

I once drove someone to a popular city overlook so they could take a picture of the sunset and had parked in front of a home legally while they got the perfect photo. The homeowners noticed at some point and stared at me from then on until the photographer returned to the car and we left.


My husband and I once drove to a gas station after dinner and I brought up something someone had said that bothered me and so my husband didnt get out immediately to pump gas. There were plenty of available pumps so we werent affecting business. Anyway a male worker came out of the gas station and said we were making the female employee nervous because we werent pumping gas right away. I explained we were having a conversation and would be getting gas soon and coming in the store. The male reiterated that we would still be making the female employee nervous.

My point there is that a nervous witness is not always seeing a suspct but possibly someone innocent.

A couple more points. Since there was no vehicle description the young sketch guy was likely on foot, however there was no mention if his clothes matched the video. If they didnt match those in then video how does le know that it was bg?

Could young sketch guy have had clothes hidden in the woods, in his car parked elsewhere, in a backpack under a jacket, at a nearby home or workplace or relative of his? Like you said if he clothes matched old sketch guy it should be the same person not a different one. To me if the clothes dont match I am concerned if the new sketch guy is the killer. I am also wondering what time of day young sketch guy was seen. If it was after the crime one would  think he would have the same clothes video bridge guy had on because it seems like there wouldnt be time to change.


Also it confuses me why young guy sketch witness got such a good look at his face apparently and yet there is not more info about where he was seen, what he was wearing and what he was doing released to the public.

I wish a reporter or someone would try to clarify all this with law enforcement because I think if they want good tips people need to know and understand more. I think confusion amongst the public could prevent good tips from coming in."
LibbyandAbby,fqw2lhl,t3_ghwzc1,1589691109.0,"Thanks for posting. It is always interesting to have new posters and see new questions. My guess was that bg was not intending to abduct one or more girls or women in his car. I have read and watched a lot of true crime and have noticed a pattern. It seems like abductions in a car are more likely to occur when a victim is walking, jogging or biking along a road. I have also read of car abductions of victims from parking lots, convenience stores, gas stations, etc.

Im not saying it is impossible or never happens but it seems like a longer more difficult type of abduction. It seems like when an attack occurs on a bike path or walking path that occurs in an area where paths are encompassed by woodlands the perp tends to force or lure the victim off the path into the woods where an assault occurs. A couple days ago I posted a video of a bike path perp that conducted assaults on his victims by getting them off the path and into the woods.

I think a perp would be unlikely to try a southern car abduction unless he was sure the owners of the properties werent around. people are very territorial about their private property especially when there is a chance of trespassers.  Of course I tend to be risk averse and maybe a perp would be willing to take such a risk."
LibbyandAbby,fqvw1bo,t1_fqvo7qi,1589686476.0,"The information about a woman seeing a suspicious man I got from keithitreal comment above mine. I was questioning what kind of behavior not on the trails could look suspicious to some woman and was offering suggestions of what she might have seen. I know nothing about her and what she did supposedly see. Maybe someone else knows. 

There has been a persistant rumor about a woman seeing a young guy in a vehicle somewhere near the trails.  When the woman asked the young guy if he needed help he supposedly said he didnt need help, that he had called his dad, but he didnt make eye contact with the woman."
LibbyandAbby,fqv6n99,t1_fquuc0e,1589670933.0,"As I have heard what witnesses supposedly saw it makes me think sixteen year old girl and the arguing guy of the arguing couple both saw the real bg separately, the girl as he was entering the trail and the arguing guy as bg was leaving after the murders. The timing seems right, the locations seem right, his direction seems right, his demeanor seems right and his appearance compared to the video seems right. Also not saying hi when teenage girl said hi and glaring at her seemed like more what a killer would do. Also teenage girl called in her tip supposedly before the video was released which seems persuasive.

Did the woman past Logan see the young guy waiting in his car for his dad supposedly who refused to make eye contact with the woman asking if he was ok?

If that wasnt him what was the young guy doing that made him seem suspicious? Driving or walking buy repeatedly, wearing a mask, wearing same clothes as bridge guy, trespassing through peoples yards, changing clothes outside, cleaning himself up outside, etc.?

Also, there is nothing to say if the younger guy was  bg that he wasnt spotted by all three, the woman, arguing guy and teenage girl.

Without more to go on the young guy seen by the woman near Logans seems less persuasive as being bg than the guy on the trails.

Don't know much about the rumor of the guy on the south end of the bridge. Could be someone else or I guess it could be bg lurking around earlier in the day. Maybe he got some lunch and tried later.

If the first released sketch was tainted I dont see why they don't fix it rather than going with a sketch of someone who seems likely to be bg."
LibbyandAbby,fquco6d,t1_fqu9pbu,1589656406.0,"I hope it isnt, ...sketch one didnt work, lets try sketch two now. I would love to know what changed their minds and caused them to release the young guy sketch. Plus half the people who watch the video seem to see some sort of face covering and thats in addition to the rumors of witnesses seeing a face scarf or covering.

Did anyone really see the lower half of his face uncovered to determine if it was a fuller, older saggy jawed guy or a youthful strong jawed young guy? And if some people did see a guy or two wandering around how did they and law enforcement decide it was likely the guy in Libbys video?"
LibbyandAbby,fqu8rln,t1_fqu3902,1589654224.0,"I suppose I should give up hoping they make perfect sense or trying to understand why the switch and just believe the suspect is more likely than not about twenty to forty which agewise probably makes more sense because I think that age group is more likely to commit rapes and murders, etc.

I still think they are not exercising enough care when releasing sketches because if the first sketch was wrong it hindered the investigation for two years. Having no sketch for the first two years would have been better than that."
LibbyandAbby,fqtvgmm,t1_fqtpj3r,1589646890.0,"Thanks for the link. I am still seeing clarity problems. First there is the following quote about one suspect but one sketch being a better representation. ..., it is the belief of investigators with the Multi-Agency Task Force that the person depicted in the sketch released on April 22nd more accurately represents the person wanted for the murders of Abigail Williams and Liberty German....

In the middle of the statement it goes into two sketches, two persons. A sketch is not a person and two sketches dont necessarily mean that two separate people were seen either of whom might have been bridge guy. If they were seen at different places on the trail at different times by different people how do they know it wasnt the same person?

If someone thought bg was twenty and some thought he was forty five, even if they were looking at the same suspect, that doesnt make two separate people.

I dont think the author of the press release did a good job. When writing something of that nature they shouldnt try to write so they might be understood but rather write so they cant be misunderstood.


If the release had said the first sketch was just plain wrong that it was of a person they have now ruled out I would be more likely to believe them. Now they say sketch two is more accurate without saying something like it was based on a different person seen on the trail that was more likely bg, the first person who was sketched having been ruled out."

LibbyandAbby,fqtkvwu,t1_fqslvdj,1589640989.0,"If I recall correctly from watching that extremely confusing press conference, didnt law enforcement say at one point that bg could look like a combination of the first and second sketch which would seem to indicate that it was two versions of the same person rather than two separate sketches of two different people?

But then I also feel like law enforcement  may have made it seem like two separate people and two separate sketches.

It seemed like a very contradictory news conference to me.

I also wonder if law enforcement just used inexact words which increased confusion by referring to the sketches as ""guys"" not sketches. For example did, as I seem to recall from watching the press conference where the second sketch was released, law enforcement say..we are looking for this guy, not that guy... which seems to imply the sketches of two different men , when a more accurate way to speak might be ....the suspect, bridge guy, who libby captured on camera was seen on or around the trails by several different witnesses. Two sketches were drawn of the suspect, each of the two based on a different witness or witness group.  We originally believed that sketch one released was the more accurate sketch of the suspect. We now believe that sketch two which we are now releasing is the better representation of the suspect.

If that was what was meant  then that would mean two different sketches of the same person, not two different sketches of two different people."
LibbyandAbby,fqsf1xl,t1_fqrrvw9,1589605533.0,"It does seem like the artist put his own strong spin on the sketch. I have trouble understanding how law enforcement just accepted that clearly wrong newsboy cap and just kept telling those at the press conference to ignore the hat. Why didnt they tell the artist to redo it with a type of hat it might actually be not one that it clearly was not?

Plus the image was on all the posters and the posters didnt say to ignore the hat, not that people would have read the fine print if there had been any on the poster. Sometimes all a poster or flyer gets is one quick glance and if something as substantial as headgear is completely wrong and nothing bg has ever worn it could totally prevent a tip from being called in."

Would it cause others to glance that way and wonder why someone was parked there or maybe cause a curious cop to pull up and see why someone was parked there?

Of course there is no perfect risk free location to park and it probably was safer than using the lot where the majority of hikers and walkers parked.

Walking off trail would certainly be a good way to learn the area under the bridge and give bg some good options for moving around and getting out quickly."

Also the artistic license to put a newsboy cap on him when the only people who tend to wear those are elderly guys or celebrities or male models not your average midwestern guy who is more likely to have on a ball cap, fishing cap, hoodie, etc. was crazy and probably kept some good tips from coming in."

Could it be because they had a suspect in mind who wasnt dressed like bg but they wanted to figure a way it could have been him?"

LibbyandAbby,fq1g64r,t1_fq191qq,1589045359.0,Him seeing the girls dropped off and hustling back has some merit. Cruising around in ones car looking for potential victims is more comfortable and less likely to arouse suspicion than loitering around parks and playgrounds for hours. I even used to wonder if there was a place he could park and look like he was just smoking a cigarette or eating lunch but still observe any drop offs at the park.
LibbyandAbby,fq197df,t1_fq16n42,1589043449.0,Even if a face covering drew attention it was cool enough that day that someone could disregard it and not enough to call law enforcement about. after the crime had occured and witnesses are being interviewed it is better from bgs perspective to have had a covered face than someone be able to say more specifically what his face looked like.
LibbyandAbby,fq13rnm,t3_ggc19f,1589041343.0,"I vaccilate on where bg might be from but the speed in which the crime was commited might point to a local.  Also he seemed to know that the south end of the bridge trail was closed off which might not be apparent from an online map. I think it was his plan to cross back over the creek so he could leave the way he entered. I think the crime scene location was preselected for maximum seclusion.

I think he had a feel for how many people may or may not have been down by the creek at that day of the week and time of year from having been there himself frequently and maybe fairly recently."

TrueChristian,fpxtokg,t3_gg326u,1588989362.0,"I have found that a lot of atheists enjoy engaging Christians because for them it is more fun than engaging each other. Its why some people with opposing political views enjoy engaging each other at times. Some really enjoy the drama and a heated exchange. Maybe stay away from social media arguments on religion. Dont feel you need to correct someone who is wrong. Maybe focus on prayer and Bible study and if someone seems genuine and asks for guidance prayerfully consider whether you should respond or not. Also from a spiritual standpoint the enemy wants to do what he can to see believers doubt their faith, so try to keep that in mind and avoid situations that seem setups for that to happen."

LibbyandAbby,fpxexo6,t1_fpxcobq,1588981371.0,"Its hard to tell. Its really hard to walk in water with shoes on. The water fills your shoes and it feels like your shoes are being pulled down and sucked off your feet each time you try to lift your knees and move your feet through the water. I think the force of the water down ones shoes could cause the girls shoes to come off even if neither girl was trying to run.

Edit. Bg apparently had boots on, which to me resembled duck boots. Since they would be higher and lace securely around the ankle and lower leg I think he would find walking through water easier than the girls who probaly had low cut gym shoes on.  Since he selected that type of footwear it makes me think he may have been planning to get his feet wet."
AskParents,fpwo3gh,t1_fpvusyg,1588966870.0,"If she wants to go into law, public speaking, debate or speech as classes or clubs would be useful.

You could offer to buy her any new books she is interested in online. Maybe find a teen reading club for the summer through the library where they offer prizes.

LibbyandAbby,fpwh4yv,t1_fpra37u,1588963355.0,"Personally I would have been very against it due to the height, lack of guardrails, rotting nature and that I believe officially it was closed to pedestrians.  Different parents are comfortable with different levels of risk though and teenage girls can tend to nag a lot if they really want to do something and sometimes parents give in. It probably didnt help that there wasnt a lot to do in that small town. I dont think they even had a movie theater or bowling alley."
LibbyandAbby,fpwfnru,t1_fpwbqr9,1588962618.0,"To me that bridge is a big trap, especially closed at one end.  Its almost like being alone in a car or boat with someone or  at a beach, on a subway, in a cemetery that is deserted or almost deserted but with only one way in and out. I think the bridge was key to his plan."
LibbyandAbby,fpwewta,t1_fpwbqr9,1588962243.0,"I think being on the bridge and being youngish were the two factors but without being on the bridge they would have been harder if not impossible to trap and ambush. Even when they saw him coming I think they hoped or believed he would turn back before he got to where they were at the south end.

Bg knew that virtually everyone at the south end walks back north along the bridge and figured they were hoping he would turn around or just be harmless if he got closer.

I think most walkers wouldnt go to the very very end of the bridge but by him starting across I think they went as far as they could possibly go. I do think that he was aware that the spot across the water where they were found couldnt be seen from the bridge itself. I think he had that location in mind all along for the assault. So he took them from the fairly secluded south end of the bridge, at least fairly secluded on a Monday, to an even more secluded spot."

LibbyandAbby,fpvkinq,t1_fpvcf1s,1588946630.0,"I am not sure there were a lot, many or any other teen girls there that day, that may have been a rumor. If someone was interested in abducting and attacking a young teen girl it is not as easy to find and abduct them as one might think. They usually are at school or participating in organized activities or home with their families. They are not usually out walking or jogging late at night. They are not out like a twenty something might be bar hopping, going to or from work or to a groccery store or convenience store or mall alone. If they go to a friends house they frequently get rides. There might be some who occasionally walk alone somewhere but I think that is the exception. If they are dropped off by family somewhere for a couple hours it would usually be a crowded place like a restaurant, a school football game and they would likely be promptly picked up when the outing was over.

If someone had it in their mind to sometime abduct and attack a girl and overheard or learned somehow that some might be going to a secluded trail with a bridge that is blocked at one end on a winter day still when most adults would be at work and the park wouldnt be overly crowded, a perp might think it would be a good time to see if they indeed show up and see if they do go on the bridge and he can trap them at the end.

Large secluded parks and trail systems have been used by those seeking to attack girls and women. Some perps may prefer girls to women but I think for some that reason is that they tend to be easier to manipulate, control and overpower.  So if someone showed up at the trail because he thought that some teen girls might be there I think it is because he thought they would be the type of victims he could control and it would be more lonelier there than on the weekend and he thought they would be on the bridge. I dont think it would be due to revenge on them or their families."

Teens can be upset if there are tough issues facing their parents,  if there are family money issues, if maybe they are adopted or find out that they are,  if they are denied doing something they want to do like learning to drive, getting a car, going to a concert or on a trip, if they are rejected by a potential bf or gf, if they feel they could be in trouble with family or law, if someone in family or they have serious health issues, if someone in family or they have substance issues, if they have been humiliated by someone, if they are being denied computer or phone use or something they feel they have to have.
