self,fqxiudr,t3_glbfb8,1589732972.0,"Im pretty quiet as well and I hate it when people pick on me about it. I like to listen to other people talk and when I have nothing to add why would i bother to open my mouth???? I’m just chilling and they take it as if something is wrong. I am very asocial and sometimes antisocial. That’s just who I am and I am okay with it most of the time. But Im also aware that I struggle making friends and opening up to people, but still that’s something that I am working on and nobody should just force it on me to be social and more extroverted. Idk."
EDAnonymous,fpr595k,t3_gexcqf,1588842872.0,This is the main reason I don’t usually exercise. I over-focus on my body and think that if I don’t exercise until I’m about to die it’s useless and not worth it. Exercising like 10 min a day makes me feel bad because it’s not enough. I have to exercise an hour at least for me to feel good about it. It sucks.

BPD,flvhncd,t3_framg2,1585524012.0,I get that feeling every now and then and I DO. It happens so many times... I’ve lost several friends because of it. Last time it happened I just left all the group chats and stopped replying to everyone. After a bit I come to realize that I shouldnt have done it and Im lonely af. So I would not recommend lol. So instead of acting on it you could try just deleting the apps from your phone or just muting everyone.
EDAnonymous,ficsw5r,t3_f7n3oo,1582356047.0,"Yea and ive been trying hard not to (at this very moment too lol)
Things ive tried: brushing my teeth before getting high, smoking right before bed, eating(?”) right before getting high, having no food around when i do, having only healthy food around when i do, not getting high at all, smoking a mole, not allowing myself to move from the bed lol, etc.

I used to be able to when i recovered for a bit. I think Its my thoughts that lead there, not really the munchies? Idk 
But rn im trying to smoke less quickly (smaller bowls) so i get the urge to binge less quickly also??

So yea just trying stuff out until something works."
Avoidant,fetew51,t3_eqindn,1579374728.0,Sounds like social anxiety or sensory overload
BPD,fe06i2d,t3_en7ynv,1578804298.0,"Mmm well it’s common to occur in moments when people have a lot anxiety. So it depends i believe. I have trichotillomania, and i do it even when im not anxious about anything at all. It is related to OCD because it’s a repetitive compulsion/obsession. I also chew the inside of my mouth, bite my nails/skin and pick at my skin but those occur more often when im really anxious. So idk it depends but yes they can be comorbid with other disorders."

bulimia,fdd59ag,t3_eknn0v,1578295380.0,"I told my partner a few days ago. We were talking about my mental state because I haven’t been doing well lately and it was to the point where I was hurting him really badly. I thought that if I really wanted to get better, I needed help. And if he truly loved me and wanted me to get better, he would listen and be there for me. I didnt even say I had an eating disorder, i just told him “I’ve been having eating problems lately” and he asked if I’ve been throwing up my food. I cried a lot lol but he just hugged me until I could breathe again. I explained a little bit of why, my use of laxatives, triggers, etc. He then said he was glad I told him cause a lot of things made sense now. I also told him what would help, like not forcing me to eat and stuff. I was really really afraid but I finally did it and so far it’s okay. 

It took me a while to tell him but I felt like it was the right moment. it’s hard to open up about something that causes so much pain every day, specially when I have so many issues already. 

Good luck! I hope everything goes well :)"

BPD,fcrple7,t3_eiab6f,1577904917.0,I hate the holidays in general but specially the whole month of December because there’s just too much excitement over nothing in my opinion lol. Maybe I’m just very pessimistic or negative or idk. And what makes it worse? My birthday is close to christmas. So it’s just a lot too excitement and affection from other people too fast. I feel nothing over new years cause for me nothing is going to change. Maybe I dissociate to the point that every day feels the same and time is not a thing anymore. Maybe I’m just hopeless.
bulimia,fcj0ywa,t3_ehe5sw,1577674566.0,This happened to me and it came back after I stopped for a bit. It helped me stop purging for a while.
BPD,fceyveh,t3_eh33lv,1577624983.0,"It sounds more like splitting. And sociopaths can still feel empathy, so sociopathy and empath are not opposites. BPD is actually correlated with lower empathy levels. Sociopathy is different. It’s being antisocial. Let’s use the word sociopath more carefully, we don’t want to stigmatize anyone."
BPD,fc7bua7,t3_egj4ee,1577502904.0,Mmm more like stimulation/distraction. I can’t stand being in my head at all so I always have some tv show in the background while I do stuff. I can’t fall asleep without it. But it’s like an escape from my thoughts. I can control it but dissociation just happens. I don’t have to be doing anything to dissociate.
BPD,fc7b0jp,t1_fc77tff,1577502264.0,"It’s more like we are more sensitive to other people’s emotions. So maybe we are better at reading people and how they feel. I think that’s a more accurate description than increased empathy. A lot of us have decreased empathy, including me."

BPD,faox0gv,t3_ea2vb7,1576274519.0,"yes, it makes me sad and also angry
Me: i only have friends because they are aware that i struggle to make friendships. I have no other friends so they feel bad for me. They actually don’t like me for who i am. 
Also me: fuck them. I don’t fucking need anyone. How dare they think low of me? I don’t need help. Leave me the fuck alone then. 

Ahhhh I hate myself lmao"
EDAnonymous,fao38yb,t3_ea5xif,1576256443.0,"I don’t eat all day because I smoke at night usually everyday. When I’m high I just eat and eat and don’t stop. It fucking sucks. I feel awful the next day and want to starve. It’s like a cycle that never ends.

eating_disorders,f9kl4ow,t3_e19fpl,1575402694.0,"Maybe disordered eating but i think an ED is sooo much more than skipping meals. It’s hell. Definitely seek help tho cause diagnoses are just labels, any help will be good for you."
BPD,f8x58tv,t1_f8vvyva,1574908578.0,Mostly repeated trauma since a single event is most likely to lead to PTSD
trichotillomania,f6kx2b7,t3_drm7u1,1572922876.0,Trich is an OCD related disorder bc of the compulsion and obsessiveness to pull. I dont think any disorder has a clear cause but it’s trich is under the OCD spectrum disorders. Never heard of it being related to BPD.
CPTSD,f4w37qw,t3_dlxe55,1571851258.0,"Yes. And it’s weird cause when i hear people talk about their childhood they had a lot of nice experiences and when I think about mine I can only remember the abuse and sad experiences. 

I even asked my psych professor why some people repress good memories instead of bad ones (people usually repress bad memories). He said it doesnt usually happen but that doesnt account for ptsd so Im not sure. 

I only have vivid memories of specific traumatic events. They are like videos replaying in my mind. I can tell you specific details of them. Good memories? Nothing. So I get really triggered when people talk about their childhood. I feel alienated, as if I didn’t have one at all."
CPTSD,f4i4otd,t3_dkje4c,1571600057.0,"I think I also see my dad that way. He abused me through my whole childhood and at first I only saw him as a bad person. I wanted him to die.

But as I went to therapy I learned so much about my dad. He was abused too as a child by his parents. He ran away from his home. And although that is not an excuse for him to abuse me, I know abuse is all he knew as love. And I realized that we are more similar than I thought. He also needs help. 

Realizing this made me go from complete anger to confusion. It’s like I can’t blame anyone for my abuse so I just blame myself. For everything. 

I don’t know I need therapy lol. But yea i can relate."
agender,f4c2reb,t3_dk76un,1571522676.0,"I feel this so hard.

I don’t connect to my body at all and I wish I didn’t have it. I don’t care for it. 

When I think about who I am, it’s just my memories. I wish I was a bodiless orb. I think I would feel more comfortable with myself if I was a robot. Somehow as I grew up I dissociated my body from me. When I look in the mirror I don’t think I see myself, it’s just a human body. And I hate it. 

So when people refer to me with whatever pronouns, i know they are referring to my physical appearance. So it doesn’t bother what pronouns they use but it bothers me that I have a body they can see and make assumptions of. 

My mental health has contributed a lot to it. I have eating problems and dysmorphia. I barely get any pictures taken, I used to think it was because I didn’t want to be remembered but it’s also because I don’t want to see what I look like. Knowing that people will look at the picture and think ‘hey that’s [me]’ bothers me. I don’t want that to be me. 

I don’t want to be in this body and i don’t know what my ‘ideal body’ would look like. I just don’t know how to get there."

trichotillomania,f34vzsf,t3_dfjt4x,1570662055.0,I’ve had trich for like 10+ years now and my parents won’t stop bothering me about it. They just don’t get it. They even will slap my hands when I’m pulling. My mom will just watch me sometimes to see if I realize I’m doing it and snap out of it. They will never get it but it’s something I got used to.
agender,f31t9w7,t3_df5ez0,1570584198.0,"I feel the same. You are super valid. I also don’t want children and would rather die than be pregnant. I wish I could get rid of my ovaries too. I don’t get my period anymore and it gives me euphoria. I wish I could get rid of my boobs, not because they make me more of a woman but I just feel like they don’t belong in my body? idk. 

Yet, I still dress ‘like a girl’. In my mind, the way I look doesn’t define my gender. I will wear tight clothes that might show my boobs/hips sometimes, I also will wear a lot of baggy clothes that can make me look like a guy/nonbinary but i don’t do it with a purpose, they are just the clothes i like! I also wear make up but anyone can wear make up! 

Overall, I don’t connect gender to anything i like/do because gender is not part of me. I don’t try to express gender like others do because I don’t know what that is like. I just am. I am I. :)"
