I‚Äôm 21 in good health! Doctors put me on heart medication to slow down my heart rate but they‚Äôre causing worse side effect. Found a lump in my breast but doctors don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just normal tissue or not, haven‚Äôt been able to sleep properly in weeks and two hours ago I woke myself up out of sleep with an anxiety attack and my body feeling numb in different areas!

relationships,fnqa774,t1_fnq9ndq,1587160668.0,You should just call him and not wait around till he‚Äôs ready because atm he‚Äôs living in his own bubble where he‚Äôs being selfish! At the end of the day if he doesn‚Äôt snap out of it now he eventually will when it‚Äôs too late and you‚Äôre over him and he‚Äôll realise the stupid mistake he has made. This whole quarantine has broken a lot of relationships but communication is key and if he doesn‚Äôt communicate with you then it will only make life harder on you down the road

People saying that he doesn‚Äôt care is a bit much, I think he may be feeling overwhelmed with everything that‚Äôs going on (lockdown) and he‚Äôs taken his problems out on the people he loves (you & his family) and his escape is online gaming with possibly people he has never met before! He needs to apologies for his actions & have a call with him where you‚Äôre both as honest as possible, it will either end good or bad but atleast you‚Äôre put out of your misery either way and can work on your relationship TOGETHER or work on yourself single"

It‚Äôs great she decided to speak to you first about it but know that self harm is all very secretive, I personally struggled with it for 2 years and even if I wasn‚Äôt sad I would still cut myself because it‚Äôs an addiction.
