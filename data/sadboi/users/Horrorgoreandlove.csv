AskReddit,fr4y9zh,t3_gln8tu,1589899150.0,"I had it along with 3/4 of my family members. In the scheme of things, I got a mellow case but its still the sickest ive ever been in my 34 years of life. The body aches were indescribable and the first couple nights of sleep were almost impossible. I was constantly waking myself up whimpering and coughing in my sleep and I have never done that, ever. Upon waking in the morning I was doing nothing but crying which is VERY out of character for me. I'm a very unemotional person. 

It took over a month to feel normal. I lost my sense of taste and couldnt eat. I stayed dizzy and weak forever. The cough lasted a month and a half. 10/10 wouldnt do it again.

To add one. My 4 year old also got it. It caused vomiting for him with a bad cough and he was sick for about a week or so. We both had temps constantly that would come and go. My 10 year old never caught it but we isolated him and I sprayed bleach and disinfected his door, door knobs, bathrooms etc. Anything I or anyone else came in touch with."

Anyways, we went along with it. He was only 18 and we were far from ready. It wasnt an easy decision but it was the best for us at the time. I dont regret it and now we have 2 beautiful boys (4 & 10) so it all worked out. 

I cant imagine where we would have been if we had continued the pregnancy but Im confident in my decision to this day."
