AskReddit,fmdmm1s,t3_fum9gp,1585971761.0,I got drunk at a party and I passed out in a room and woke up to a guy raping me. I freaked out and thankfully he got off me and left. I had to go to the hospital and do a rape kit. It was awful I blamed myself for years. If I hadn't drank so much it never would have happened. I found out I wasn't the first girl he had done this to. I was in the process of talking to detectives. His friends started show up at my work and harassing me. I dropped the charges and ended up moving to a different state. Part of me wishes I had gone through with the charges but the main part of me just wanted to feel safe again. Its been about 14 years since it happened. I don't blame myself anymore. No matter how much alcohol or drugs a person consumes no one ever asks to be raped. And I don't resent the guy either I feel bad him. He has a daughter and I hope nothing like that ever happens to her.
