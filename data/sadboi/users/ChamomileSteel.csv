AskWomen,fjj8lk8,t3_fdq8tb,1583386523.0,"Physical appearance is less important to me compared to respect, integrity, intelligence, & confidence. 

We’re hip to PUA tactics & those behaviors are deal breakers. 

The difference between hot and cute, in my opinion, come down to confidence. Generally I’m not into someone “cute” anyway. That’s just me. 

A man is hot when he knows what he wants & is transparent with his intentions. Of course if his intentions are to “pump & dump”, it’s repulsive. But Id have more respect for someone who actually says what they want vs. guys who say anything to deceive a woman into considering them for sex.

Tldr: Be yourself. Don’t worry what anyone thinks is hot. If she’s not into you, it’s no ones fault. Keep it movin."

This one’s for the scrotes/make lurkers reading: 

Fuck offffff~

Though I’m sure it varies by state & nation- Child support payments can only be enforced if a father’s name is on the child’s birth certificate. Father’s are not forced to sign the birth certificate (UNLESS baby’s mom gets a court order for the guy to take a paternity test). If the father DECLINES to sign the birth certificate, then they don’t get custody rights of the child therefore not forced to pay ANY child support . Which a ton of y’all be doing intentionally so stfu. 

So FIRST OF ALL...if they’re shitty enough to make the assertion that child support be contingent upon a woman’s sex partners... then don’t sign for paternity on your child’s birth certificate, fucko. 

SECOND... Child support doesn’t come into play if the father in a committed relationship with a child’s mother. So wtf? She doesn’t owe you fidelity (ever) but certainly not when the father’s been court ordered to provide child support. 

Ive had to have this discussion with so many men who have NO IDEA how paternity & child support works.

I don’t even have children, but I was a victim advocate for women (and many mothers)...plus I can read & use google? Take some fucking initiative to learn how EASY it is for men to get away with not paying child support. AND how common it is for women to protect their babies from shitty fathers by not asking for paternity tests so they can’t sue for visitation/custody.

You aren’t alone. Went to the ER for my first panic attack because I was CERTAIN I was having a heart attack.

FemaleDatingStrategy,fi268un,t3_f61qz9,1582072429.0,"Hey :) Remember every individual has their own values & intentions they bring to every relationship. A marriage timeline is subjective because it all depends on how soon either person wants to get married. 

Verbalizing clear intentions is crucial.
If someone’s end-goal is to be married, it’s their responsibility to speak up. Both people have to be onboard or else you risk being a forever gf...waiting for a partner to make up their mind. Forever girlfriends stay with partners because they fantasize about their partners potential. 

If someone is uncertain of what they want, it’s their responsibility to find out before they play with people’s feelings (aka dating). 

Hope that helps."

AskWomen,fha4uxc,t3_f23ao2,1581397248.0,"Everyone is different. And sometimes people misperceive things as hints of sexual/romantic interest. For example, I have twirled my hair since I was 10. Several men have commented that it makes me look ditzy or like I’m flirting (because there’s theories that women play with their hair subconsciously to attract eyes to them). I can say with 100% certainty that my hair twirling means I’m trying to concentrate or I’m anxious. 

There’s also a distinction between curiosity & legit romantic interest. 

So basically....instead of trying to read each other’s minds & body language, we could start being more authentic & vulnerable with expressing our feelings. If the person doesn’t reciprocate or share the attraction we’ve expressed, then it’s not a match. No ones fault. And this goes for every human being."

AskFeminists,fgtp34t,t3_f0frdw,1581107525.0,"Oh! Also- marital rape has very recently been made illegal. Historically, rape was not always heavily punished. In fact, many women around the world are still condemned to marry their rapist. 

In parts of the US, rapists can file for custody of children born as a result of their rape. 

Rape is extremely hard to prosecute for various reasons- again leading back to the extreme fear of reporting a rape. In Florida, victims are legally required to testify in front of their rapist. The majority of the rape survivors I’ve worked with as a victim advocate chose not to report or press charges on their rapist because of stigma, retraumatization, & fear of retaliation. 

Rape is still used as a war tactic globally. 

Jokes about prison rape perpetuate stigma of male sexual assault.

AskFeminists,fgtnwhu,t3_f0frdw,1581107056.0,"Sometimes “unsatisfactory” research results illuminate our own biases...Nevertheless, this is an extremely important topic & I suppose I’m glad you’re searching for a deeper understanding of Rape Culture. 

Defining any cultural phenomenon will take time & several conversations with people affected by the culture. So for the sake of time- One of the most prevent aspects of rape culture is “victim blaming” (i.e. When survivors of rape are blamed for being assaulted.).

Rape culture is also insidiously wrapped into our socialization. A covert form of victim blaming begins when individuals are taught not to dress “provocatively” because it would increase the likelihood of being harassed...Where its much more successful to teach people not to rape. 

Rape culture affects men as well- where we see that men are discouraged to report rape due to intense stigma via toxic masculinity. 

Rape culture shows up in our media. It’s often romanticized in film & it’s obviously very pervasive in pornography.

He frequently shirked accountability for his emotional detachment, while Id stay up every night reading about how to “be better” in the relationship. I’d ask him to tell me what his needs were & do my best to fulfill them. The stress & trauma I experienced at work made it extremely hard for me to please him. So I quit my job. But it was too late...

I finally came to the realization that he’d been detaching emotionally for a while & I suppose that’s partly because he wanted it to be easier for when he finally left. At least, that’s what I tell myself?

AmItheAsshole,f80ah5v,t3_dy92i1,1574124289.0,"I hope this isn’t real... the way you speak to your child becomes HER INNER VOICE. Being subjectivity “real” is simply your personal judgments & doesn’t work as well to motivate anyone compared to positive reinforcement. 


From a personal & therapeutic standpoint- This is really fucked up, man. Apologize to your kid. Adults fuck up & we need to teach kids that authority figures are fallible. 

YOU are the asshole..."
AmItheAsshole,f809icf,t3_dy6864,1574123598.0,"No shade...but I found out that a huge reason my parents divorced was because my dad wasn’t able to stay for the entire duration of my grandma’s (mom’s mom) funeral, since he had to start work with a new company. I can’t take sides, to this day, because I empathize with both of their frustrations. 

Your gf needs & deserves your emotional support...just like you deserve your autonomy. Maybe ask her what she needs from you emotionally & get her feedback on how you can provide that support while still going on your trip. 

(Unsolicited opinion- Now isn’t the time to justify your actions based on her late brothers behaviors. You will lose her if you lead with that.) 

You have to really analyze your priorities. No one has the authority to decide what is the “right thing to do” except YOU. Own whatever choice you make & be accountable for the outcome."
BodyAcceptance,f800mj8,t3_dyazrx,1574119042.0,"Hey :) Thanks for being vulnerable & posting this. I really relate to those sentiments- especially your title including “(perceived?)”... 

We question ourselves first, because we’re empathetic ...when it’s clear from an outside perspective that your perception is completely accurate. 

I’m not here to give advice because It’d be presumptuous & impossible to understand your complete family dynamic.

I’m just here to say you’re not alone. Your perception is valid. You’re not in the wrong. You expressed your boundaries amazingly despite the anxiety of standing up to your family. 

I hope someday they are accountable for their impact on your life...And I hope they will accept you for ALL of you. But you said it best- we can’t make them respect our boundaries. 

Thanks again for sharing this. It made me feel less weird about my relationship with my folks because I know I’m not alone."
AmItheAsshole,f7zw2fm,t3_dy822e,1574117016.0,"NOPE. You have a right to your privacy & so does he. This would certainly be a topic to discuss together...this way y’all can assess, as a couple, what his objective was in asking. It’s a good time to talk about needs, boundaries, and compromises. 

Trust can be so fickle...and I think it’s healthy for people to be skeptical in relationships- however, this doesn’t mean people can impose control over each other’s personal property & personal info."
seduction,f7zurku,t3_dyanjj,1574116442.0,"Hey :) Hope you’re doing okay. You’re not alone. You didn’t do anything wrong here...

Regarding your friend- We can only control our own actions. There’s nothing you can (or should feel compelled to) do to make her empathize with you at this time. It may take her a while to accept what her bf did, but she may never believe you (unfortunately). It’s not your responsibility to convince her- but if you wanted to, discussing what happened may help her get away from this violent man. You don’t owe your story to ANYONE though. 

I hope this helps...Please know you aren’t alone. I am a trauma survivor & work as an advocate & mentor for women who’ve experienced sexual assault/exploitation. If you need ***anything*** please feel free to reach out. 

Much love ❤️"
BodyAcceptance,f7x8gl3,t3_dxuzph,1574049176.0,"Hey :)  Thank you for your vulnerability ❤️

(Slightly irrelevant context:

I’m an enneagram type 4 too (26F). I’m about 6 feet tall and have always “struggled” with being overweight. I compensated for my perceived lack of physical attraction with my intelligence...but I still felt like a stranger in my own skin, even after I received my masters degree.
 
My parents started me in weight watchers at age 10...I never really lost weight until college. I had plastic surgery at age 22 after an ex bf leaked photos of me & shamed me in front of his friends.  I developed an eating disorder shortly after & developed a dependency on medications that kept my appetite suppressed. ) 
 
Thus- 
I say all of this to let you know you aren’t alone AND to warn you that our search for identity can lead to self-destruction. 

Attractiveness is subjective. If we’re never “good enough” for ourselves, we’re certainly doomed...Because we’re rarely“good enough” for other people. There will always be people who give unsolicited feedback on our appearance, lifestyles, and choices. This outside feedback leads us into a cycle of codependency & insecurity. 

Beautiful- You are the captain of your ship. You are the master of your fate. And you are not alone. You’re brave for writing about your truth & I believe in you. 

Ask yourself what you need & then give yourself what YOU need.

Much love ❤️"
PurplePillDebate,f6poyed,t1_f6pjtdv,1573061142.0,"That being said....How do women approach the disdain some men express about feeling obligated to pay for everything? Is it simply a verbal gesture of gratitude? What are the specific expectations, in your opinion? If it’s problematic that men are made to feel obligated to provide....What is the solution?"
PurplePillDebate,f6p9wl8,t1_f6p812a,1573051362.0,It’s easy for me to lose sight of the sentiments you expressed...I feel the solidarity right now & I’m so grateful. Thank you for taking the time to give feedback.
PurplePillDebate,f6p72ch,t1_f6p6ovt,1573049240.0,So it’s not sexy to be financially independent...and y’all don’t want to pay our bills... The logic is impeccable. Thanks for enlightening us 🙏🏼
PurplePillDebate,f6p61hq,t3_dsg59c,1573048438.0,"(Not Sarcasm) Am I (26F) a chump for never asking men to pay for anything? I thought financial independence was sexy... It’s also crucial to women’s survival that we not depend on y’all financially. That way, if/when a man walks out on us, we’re not left destitute. Expecting men to support us financially is a one-way ticket to relationships where the man has control over you. That’s not safe for us...Ladies- keep grinding & work hard till you own it ❤️😽"

socialwork,f698q66,t3_dqoo01,1572738248.0,Thank you for the work you’ve done on behalf of the clients we serve. I’m here as a fellow social worker to simply show my gratitude.
DeadBedrooms,f527frv,t1_f523jlj,1571947868.0,Yessss. There is freedom in practicing empathy & compassion. Thrive on.
DeadBedrooms,f520zp3,t3_dmg4vd,1571946246.0,THANK YOU!!! Thank you for not blaming your partner. Thank you for being so vulnerable and accountable. I get disheartened that the majority of posts on this subject implicate their partner & lament the “victim” point of view. (Those emotions are valid- but you prove to us that your feelings aren’t an excuse to point the finger at our partner)
DeadBedrooms,f0nvpt3,t3_d5kil4,1568782555.0,"You are not alone <3 I empathize with you & validate your sentiments. I’m 25F & extremely sex positive, but after starting my career as a clinician, I started started working with clients who’ve experienced trauma...I say that to highlight that shit happens in life. It’s not a choice to have a LL....& it shouldn’t always fall on the LL partner to defer to the HL partner’s terms. We ALL  deserve understanding and EMPATHY for our differing perceptions/abilities regarding sexual intimacy. Your needs matter too. What do YOU need?"

socialwork,exl9jy5,t3_ct0mms,1566408691.0,"Please remember that **you are not alone**. This is a shared experience throughout our field. **There is nothing wrong with you** that is contributing to the feelings of concern that you're stuck in a cycle, the feelings of guilt, the anxiety of completing work. In my experience (MSW working with clients who've experienced trauma/sex trafficking) those feelings may not ever ""go away""... However- Self-Compassion has been life changing for me. I would encourage you to see if that framework model would be beneficial to you. [https://self-compassion.org](https://self-compassion.org)

Keep on trying things until you find something that works for YOU. You got this!!"
