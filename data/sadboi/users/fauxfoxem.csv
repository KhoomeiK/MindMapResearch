fantasywriters,fq4r7g1,t3_ggrbfv,1589082273.0,"A couple of points:

First, 10k words provides plenty of time in which to hook a reader in. Plenty of stories are told in their entirety in 10k words (or less). This magazine seems to be seeking out short fiction, and so it’s important to tailor your craft to that medium. Even fantasy serials don’t want expository world building, especially with only 10k words to work with. As such, the explanatory portion of world building can be completely foregone. So long as the world has a logic to it, the reader doesn’t need to understand why that logic functions, so long as it’s consistent. Further, keep names and titles to a minimum. One character with a grandiose name can work if having such a name is apart of his character, but your first paragraph alone has far too many titles. Also, there are some strange syntactic choices being made, and it’s hard to discern whether that’s intentional or because of an issue with grammar.

I’m not trying to be harsh, just helpful. Most of my work is in the short story realm, so I just wanted to maybe clarify aspects of the medium a bit for you while you work on this piece."
AmItheAsshole,fq1hgs7,t1_fq1gcyk,1589045693.0,"You can gaslight someone by insisting that their behavior is entirely abnormal, thus making them question the sanity of their emotional response. If someone treats you poorly and insists that it’s your fault and that you started it and “forced their hand”, that can be considered gaslighting, because it is after all a lie. I think there’s some nuance to it in that this has to be somewhat known by the person doing the gaslighting (as in, a conscious attempt at making the other person feel bad or actively ignoring their rationality, not just saying the wrong thing or being misinterpreted), but that’s my understanding of it."
writing,fpqo936,t3_getl72,1588827614.0,"Plenty of stories don’t actually need much character description. Romance genres are usually an exception, since attraction is the focal point. However, if your story is an action/adventure/thriller/etc, heavy character description isn’t all that necessary, unless relevant to the plot (a story about racial injustice, for example, would require a physical description).

I’ve found that verbs are more useful for describing a character- a character that saunters instantly suggests a certain appearance without you having to talk about a lithe body or whatever. This sort of language can also lead to an explicit physical description if that description subverts one’s expectations- a character that hobbles while also being described as wildly attractive might subvert one’s expectations and reveal something about that character.

Overall, there’s really no wrong time to include physical descriptors. Just be sure to avoid any sort of sentence about how their “brunette hair lazily falls across their shoulders” or how her clothes clung tightly to her “mildly curvaceous body”. 

It’s also fair to have a character describe others through physical features if it’s within their character to do so. A rough-around-the-edges character might have an internal monologue like, “Jessie had one of those crooked noses surely sustained from years of softball practice.” Descriptions like that reveal physical traits, but also the attitude of the POV character, which is far more important."

My dermatologist says they’re likely post-inflammatory erythema and that they do go away with time (though unfortunately that can mean anywhere from 3 months to a year). Vitamin C, Azelaic acid, and chemical exfoliants can help, as well as just keep your skin moisturized. I really like a combination of chemical exfoliating pads and Vanicream. My dermatologist also recommended a silicone scar cream- she specifically suggested New Gel, which I think has vitamin E added. Rose hip oil has also proven massively helpful in my personal experience- I had deep red scars that led to large PIE marks, and they’ve taken about four months to heal. You can determine if it’s PIE by pressing them and seeing if they “blanche” (change color or lighten with pressure). If not, they could be post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, which can be helped with a similar routine, but which has more to do with the melanin in the skin and which don’t go away with time as easily, in my research."

Seems like they really don’t want students back on campus. The part about refunding meal plans makes me nervous, since it suggests they might prevent students from working in dining. Here’s the email:

""Dear Colleagues:

I know that you are being bombarded with questions regarding the university’s response to COVID-19 pandemic.  The deans have been forwarding many questions to the Provost’s Office and I am sharing his preliminary answers to them here.  If President Sands and the COVID-19 Executive Workgroup revise any of these directives, I will certainly let you know.

Should students be discouraged from returning to campus after the extended Spring Break?
Yes, unless they have no alternative or have a good justification for returning, such as not having online access at home.

After Spring Break, instruction will resume via online delivery.  Does this include all hands-on laboratories, studios, etc.?
Yes, there will be no exceptions, no required on-campus instruction.  If necessary, laboratories will be presented via Zoom or another suitable medium as demonstrations.  Instructional spaces such as classrooms, studios and laboratories will be physically closed. 

Will students be allowed to return to on-campus housing?
Only those who need to be housed, have no other feasible place to go, or have a strong justification.  Approval by DSA will be necessary.

Will students who do not return to on-campus housing be required to pay housing expenses?
No, the expense will be prorated from the end of the original Spring Break.  Pre-paid dining for seniors who graduate in May will also be reimbursed. 

Will undergraduates still be allowed to work on campus?
No.

Will graduate assistants be allowed to work on campus?
Yes, graduate assistants will be needed to support instructional efforts and research, but should not be required to do so.

Will the library remain open?
Yes, but with appropriate application of public health measures (hand cleansing, etc.) and social distancing (refers to the risk of the virus being transferred from one person to another by droplets dispersed while speaking, coughing, etc. and involves maintaining a distance of about a yard).

What should students do who are working for credit in laboratories? These classes can't be taught online.  Are students allowed to continue to work in laboratories?  Are they required to do so? If not, will we be awarding credits without any further participation in the day to day work of the lab?
Undergraduate students should be encouraged to stay home.  Expect additional guidance on the academic credit issue.  Perhaps expectations could be revised to focus on tasks that can be done remotely, such as study design, literature searches, data collation and analysis, with mentorship by Zoom.

They also can’t be fitted to some cars (either that, or people just refuse to install them, I’m not sure), in which case you’re just fucked. The interlock devices are also required for every car in your name, and possibly every car you have access too- so a father who gets a DUI and who has purchased all the family cars can cause the rest of the family to have to install the devices (I’m not sure if this is enforced in practice, but that’s how the law was explained to me by the DMV). I’m pretty sure they also require that you blow randomly throughout your drive, which seems dangerous. If you blow anything at all, your license is revoked (I’ve been told a breathalyzer can be triggered by things other than drinking, but who knows).

This is all stuff I’ve been informed of during the process of my friend’s DUI (I was a witness in the case, hence why I was so involved). DUIs are selfish crimes that should be dealt with, but you can be charged with a DUI for 1) sleeping in your car, 2) having the keys in a parking lot if you’ve been drinking, 3) using your car’s radio while drinking without being in the vehicle. To me, these don’t seem like they make sense as DUIs.

OCPoetry,fakwnub,t3_e9q65s,1576174381.0,"Hey there! Thanks for sharing.

I think this poem would work better if you either did away with the rhyme scheme entirely, or revised it so that it was a metered rhyme scheme with more apt rhymes. Rhyming, particularly couplets with end-rhymes, will always feel contrived unless the rhymes truly feel like they make use of the “perfect word”.  For example, rhyming “promises” and “multiple misses” feels like a missed opportunity to say something truly impactful- the focus on rhyme is holding you back from using stronger words, particularly stronger verbs and nouns. 

Ask yourself- did you have to change direction in the poem in order to maintain a rhyme scheme? Do you feel like there was another, stronger sentiment you wanted to share but couldn’t find a way to say it in these couplets? If so, I’d say go for an open-verse poem, or perhaps opt for another traditional style that isn’t so rhyme-heavy.

There are also some awkward syntactic choices made within this poem- phrases such as “the walls of world” seem like they’re missing a word or two. Specifically, I think you’re missing the word “the” before many of your nouns- “the brink”, “the world”, “the ability”. It’s not that you can’t make the conscious decision to omit these words, but that these omissions should be done strategically. 

Finally, this poem seems to be reflective- you were 22, where in life are you now? Why are you reflecting? What came of this strife? You don’t need to answer these questions in the poem necessarily, but they could be useful in providing new direction if you end up revising this piece. You could even attempt to write it as though you were still 22- saying “I am 22” could lend this poem more urgency. You could keep it reflective, too, but it could be useful to indicate a reason for the reflection or what came of this downward spiral- not necessarily some poignant epiphany or change, but even just a philosophy or mindset you adapted due to the circumstances. Something to engage active, present language could be useful.

menwritingwomen,faj2xbz,t1_faimseq,1576122987.0,"Isn’t he referenced in a Murakami novel? I’m pretty sure Murakami’s “A Wild Sheep Chase” is in part inspired by Mishima’s death and writing.

I’m kind of fascinated by the connection because both authors also write some strange sex scenes and descriptions of women. It’s misogynist in a surface level kind of way, but I’d like to think that at least in Murakami’s writing it’s intentional. Not sure though. I’ve scene excerpts from Murakami on this sub before.

That being said, I never want to buy a luxury lip liner because... I mean, that just seems silly when there are plenty of drugstore liners with great pigmentation. My favorite lip liner right now is the Joah Lip Candy liner. This is a “K-beauty” brand I found at CVS and the liners just work really well for me. I’ve used MAC lip liners before, which are nice, but I honestly found them to run out far quicker than my drugstore liners. I wouldn’t worry about specifically matching your lipstick to your liner- mine always blend together so as long as the color is similar, it doesn’t look strange. I own a muted red, pink, bright red, and brown liner. I have lipsticks in a lot of shades, but these liners have basically worked with everything I own. I could maybe see myself needing a purple liner since I wear a lot of purple lipsticks, but that’s about it."
CompulsiveSkinPicking,fa0qgxg,t3_e7k48l,1575758685.0,"My lowest moment happened only a few weeks ago, but it’s why I ended up on this sub committed to fully stopping my OCD-driven skin picking compulsion.

I had just finished testifying at a trial. This had been a very stressful feat, and it had been a major stressor looming over me for months. I wasn’t on trial, I was acting as a witness, but the trial basically rested on my testimony (and the judge’s decision, but everyone on the prosecution had basically told me that my testimony was going to determine the outcome).

So, the trial ends, and it goes well. The stress is gone. Life feels normal- right? Except I had gone through this whole process with a smattering of new acne, which was far worse than usual and certainly caused by the stress. 

When I got home that night, I went into a picking frenzy. I think I just wanted to feel fully relieved and these zits were reminding me of the trial I’d just endured. So, I picked at my face and went to bed. When I woke up, I was bleeding, my skin was so dry, and the spots were clearly going to scar. They were red and cratered. My acne has always been extremely mild- as in, I get maybe three pimples a month or just a clogged pore or two. To see my face with this degree of scarring, knowing it was entirely self-caused, was mortifying. I didn’t want to go out. Thanksgiving was coming up and I was going to see my boyfriend and my family. I felt like they’d all see me as this ugly monster.

I went into panic mode trying to fix my face. The spots started healing, but I was depressed, anxious, and crying all the time. I hated myself. I turned all the mirrors around. I yelled at my boyfriend and my mom on two occasions because they’d walked in on me without makeup and I demanded that they not look at me- this was an awful reaction that made me feel even more guilty. To top it all off, I got my period and the accompanying period bloat. I felt like I’d lost my body, my face, my mind, and was going to lose my relationship too.

I calmed myself down, eventually, after talking about the stress with my boyfriend and mother, who I am so grateful for. They were concerned, not angry, and comforted me. 

My face is still healing, but I managed to find a great skincare routine to minimize the effects (partially thanks to this sub). The spots left minimal scarring and while there is some PIE, I know that with time and care that redness will go away. My skin is at least smooth enough now that it looks like my usual skin with makeup on. 

Just wanted to share, because I think my experience definitely highlights not just the physical, but emotional toll that this compulsion can take. I really want to thank everyone on this sub who normalized my experience and offered advice through your own posts- it was one of the greatest moments of relief I experienced during the ordeal."

I’ve found that writing semi-autobiographical stuff helps too- either writing about a fantasy I want to live out or about characters struggling the way I have. Plus, it’s helped me to at least feel like I’m “doing something”. One of the things that keeps me grounded is attending writing workshops and courses. It’s one of the only spaces in which I’m never really sad and can actually meaningfully engage with other people without being overwhelmed by my anxiety.

I used to cosplay for the same reason too- it allowed me to be someone other than myself, and that made me happy. It let me be around people who oftentimes felt the same way or had similar experiences.

There’s nothing juvenile or sad about wanting to escape. Fantasy is a hugely marketable genre across all mediums because most people need a means of escape. 

Now if only there was a way to actually be consistently happy while engaging these fantasies... but I do recommend trying to engage with the stuff you like in positive communities, because at least it provides some sense of purpose and contentedness."

Like, so many gorgeous eyeshadow looks were instantly swallowed by these enormous peacock feather lashes.

Plus, it’s really harmful to hear over and over that women are “taken seriously” but not men. Yes, male victims face a different struggle (that is, they’re not really seen), but even if on paper there seem to be sexual harassment and assault policies protecting women, the implementation of these policies is less than stellar. Women are absolutely still facing criticism for coming out against their abusers.

Further, men who are assaulted by other men don’t have a voice here for the most part, which is deeply disturbing. 

Victims facing different forms of societal scrutiny is not proof that one group suffers more than another. Statistics of which group is assaulted more or which group has less of an opportunity to report a crime are useful for analyzing the underlying problems perpetuating assault, but they don’t take away from the individual’s experience. A woman being raped shouldn’t be told to take comfort in knowing that at least “she’s listened to”, because 1) ew, 2) that’s not even necessarily true, and 3) the rape still happened. Same idea of why it’d be gross to devalue a man’s assault experience because women statistically experience assault more frequently- it doesn’t mean that the individual’s experience is any less traumatic or that they deserve less support."

Like, kids make messes. You were a kid who made a mess. Kids make loud noises. Sometimes parents can’t immediately catch and stop a behavior, and on top of that, just because YOU find a child’s actions annoying doesn’t mean the parent should be culled for not instantly putting an end to it. A kid crying because he doesn’t understand something isn’t the parent teaching them that crying gets them what they want- sometimes kids just cry.

AskReddit,f7ozdzl,t1_f7omfwu,1573938199.0,"Well, all throughout high school I kind of knew something was off, and I assumed it was BPD and OCD. I didn’t have access to a psychologist, and most won’t diagnosis minors with personality disorders anyway, so I sort of just crept around in online spaces for those disorders for awhile and tried to cope by learning more about them.

Once in college, I could see a psychiatrist and therapist and got properly diagnosed (and my guesses were dead-on, plus PTSD and accompanying anxiety/depression). They got me started on behavioral therapy (DBT mostly) and meds. I’ve also been hospitalized once.

But now that I’ve got resources and know what’s wrong with me, I’m able to better manage it and talk about it with my loved ones. Doesn’t mean it isn’t impacting me daily, just that I can cope better.

AskReddit,f6o7xll,t3_ds15o9,1573009892.0,"It depends on how you go about it, and I’ll preface this by saying that I’m 22 and in college, so I can’t give great advice for older folks.

It sounds counterintuitive, but go into it knowing that there’s a good chance the girl you’re talking to is either not interested in dating or already has a boyfriend. If this sounds immediately off-putting, reflect on why. A conversation with a woman should be interesting enough that even if you don’t end up in a romantic escapade, you’re not feeling like you’ve wasted your time by talking to her (assuming she’s an interesting person you’d wanna talk to anyway).

When I’m dating, if a guy approaches me in an appropriate setting (we’re somewhere mundane and killing time or at a bar/party), I’ll gladly spend time talking to you and getting to know you. I’m down for friends! Unfortunately, a lot of people aren’t, and so that kills the conversation and makes both parties feel awkward. Approach the woman knowing this is a possibility and accept that a friendship could very well be worthwhile.

When I’m single, it’s the same thing. Just talk to me! Even if I’m not with anyone, I may not be interested romantically, but that can always change with a good conversation and a budding connection.

If you just want to hook up, keep chatting with women under these assumptions until one indicates that they’re interested. Invite her to go to another bar, or to a quieter area to get to talking. If she obliges, there’s a good chance it might go somewhere- not sex necessarily, but you could get a number and it could bud into something else!

The fatal flaw I see men succumbing to is only approaching women as though they’re interesting up until they express any disinterest in a sexual/romantic relationship. Disinterest in romance doesn’t necessarily mean disinterest in you, but you have to make the woman understand that you’re okay with that. I’ve met cool people this way, and when I’m single, those people are the ones I turn to and text back, not the, “So, do you have a boyfriend?” open-liner people.

Finally, don’t make aggressive moves. Like, just don’t. Unless she’s flirting and you’re flirting, making a move can be uncomfortable. Also, most women appreciate swapping numbers first far more than they do an immediate, “Let’s go back to my place.” If you swap numbers and are still flirting and she’s still hanging around, then put that offer on the table in a nonchalant way. That’s your cue.

Also: flirting isn’t just being nice. It isn’t just saying “thank you” to your compliments. Flirting is a back-and-forth, so see how she responds. Not every girl is forward, but I’m single and a cute guy flirts with me, I’ll give compliments back and keep the conversation going. That’s a good cue.

Just have a regular conversation and pick up on social cues. Hesitation is almost always a no, so don’t push. 

And never push for conversation in inescapable situations! I’ll chat on a bus, but not if I’m in the window seat and you’ve blocked me in. Give the girl an exit so she doesn’t feel pressured to be nice- it’ll send the wrong message to you and make her even more nervous.

Carnation is my absolute favorite everyday color- it’s a really flattering, muted red tone that I adore. Only downside is that they tend to need reapplication after eating, but they’re so nice to put on that I really don’t mind.

The gym is great, but I get why a lot of people don’t go— it costs money, it can be intimidating, and some people just don’t like that environment. That’s fine. But something to move your body is super worthwhile. Hiking, HIIT, weight-lifting, pilates... there’s always something, and most of it is free or at least super cheap. I like doing mat workouts and I’ve only spent money on the mat itself and a single pair of dumbbells. You probably don’t even have to do that."
muacjdiscussion,f5118ik,t1_f50ynjn,1571935827.0,"I absolutely love NARS Sheer Glow when I want to go full-glam and the newly released Shiseido Synchro Skin foundation for everyday wear. My go-to ""no makeup"" makeup look uses the Dr. Jart Cicapair Tiger Grass Camo Drops. It's not really a foundation in the traditional sense, but it's amazing for evening out my skin-tone without looking like I'm wearing anything. I will say though that it goes on green and turns beige to blend in with skin, so I'm not sure if it would work on darker skin tones."
muacjdiscussion,f50xk1m,t3_dmgf9n,1571934391.0,"I love the base makeup products that I have and just wish I would’ve spent less money reaching that point. There are really only three foundations I like, but I own over twenty (granted, I’ve collected them over years).

I also wish I would’ve invested more in color. I just want more colorful eyeshadow palettes and fewer rose golds and neutrals. Like, once I own colorful eye makeup (mascara, liner, and maybe one solid rainbow palette), I can’t imagine myself wanting anything else. Wish I would’ve discovered that about myself sooner, though. I own way too many boring pink-and-brown palettes."
Instagramreality,f4rf66k,t1_f4r3n40,1571766738.0,"I feel you! I have a really pointed, defined nose and I think it would be attractive if it weren’t asymmetrical. Nobody has ever said it’s asymmetrical, but when I take a photo, all I can see is how crooked it is. I just don’t have any concept of what I look like or what humans look like. It’s definitely crazy how much a photo-sharing platform has warped my idea of the human body."
Instagramreality,f4quuvd,t3_dlg3ix,1571758579.0,"Stuff like this is so insidious! I’m always so self-conscious about my jaw and want it to look slimmer even though I’m technically underweight right now (healthy, just can’t seem to put the weight on). As silly as it sounds, stuff like Instagram really does take a toll on my self-esteem. It’s so easy to believe that you’re the only person in the world lacking a chiseled jawline and sharp, tiny nose. But even these beautiful people don’t have the “perfect” Instagram face. It really messes with your head, and it sucks, because women like this are already so gorgeous."
SkincareAddiction,f4gwyo7,t1_f4greb7,1571585863.0,"I use the TO 10% Niacinamide and my skin is extra sensitive and I’ve been able to use it without any problems! I only use a little bit (1/3-1/2 of the dropper) and I usually put it over top another oil (TO rose is a good one). I let the first oil sink in a bit first.

Hope that helps!"
fantasywriters,f3rmhk3,t1_f3qo63q,1571089528.0,"This very much looks like an under-edited book cover from the Warriors series (the one about cats). I almost like it, but that mongoose face is hilarious."
BadMUAs,f3qb1r9,t1_f3qa2k0,1571072186.0,"You look fantastic though!! 

And hey, even if you don’t know how to do eyeshadow yet, take solace in the fact that apparently this MUA doesn’t either, and that’s their job. I’m sure you can learn if you want to!"
menwritingwomen,f3q8fsg,t1_f3pvohz,1571071159.0,"Dudes like this are practically foaming at the mouth to reveal that they’re pedophiles. Like, what a nonsense, misogynistic, and downright disgusting thing to say, let alone to a 19-year-old. 

It’s a horrible enough thing to say to an older woman, but to say it to a teenager has that added layer of admitting that this dude sees adults as barely “fuckable”... ick."
