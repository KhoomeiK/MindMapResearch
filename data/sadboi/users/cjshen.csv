Plus who doesn't like looking up at night and seeing a billion stars through night vision? And why so aggressive?
airsoft,fiyfnsc,t1_fiydkj9,1582838492.0,They're not 7 thousand. You can by pvs15s for around 5k-5.5k. You can build a budget dual pvs14 setup for around 3 to 3.5 depending and maybe a set of mod 3 or sentinels for 4-5. You don't really seem to know much about the night vision market and are the one calling others retards.... interesting.
