Practice self compassion and practice gratitude. Meditation also helps a great deal. But ultimately you have to find comfort in your solitude. 

And when you open yourself to others, do it sincerely, and know that people will let you down and sometimes try and get advantage out of you. Learn to forgive and to let go. If you learn to be good and excellent company on your own. You will truly enjoy your free time. And people will also enjoy your company. 

Good luck on developing meaningful interpersonal connections with others."

What you have to do now is discover your inner child and not neglect it. Seek professional help. Get your meds to help you minimize symptoms. Pick yourself up. Do therapy, meditation. Get on The Crappy Childhood fairy program, if you must. Also, establish healthy interpersonal relationships with other people. Good meaningful friendships that help you grow and heal. Cut all toxic connections out of your life. And above all, practice gratitude, self compassion and understanding. The wounds won‚Äôt go away but you have the power to make them smaller.

ptsd,fpwlds1,t3_gfynye,1588965501.0,"Agreed. I experienced a similar reaction of disbelief when I was first diagnosed. But I have the Complex Variant, which in my case, is due to years of emotional neglect, experiences of abandonment and rejection from family for being homosexual. Even more surprising, research celebrities that have PTSD. For instance, take [Dolph Lundgren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNOE0dZpHcY). Who experienced years of emotional and physical abuse by the hands of his violent father, and lack of protection from him, by his submissive mother. I recommend watching his Ted Talk. It's very inspirational. The good news is that now that you have the diagnosis, you have the power to begin your journey in healing. Best of luck. :)"

In the form of neglect, rejection and abandonment. Is like trying to kill a dead horse. He's better off becoming independent, moving on and forgiving them later. To stay is slow and painful death. Eats away at the soul. Each individual needs to take responsibility for their own happiness and to do that is very empowering and liberating. Which is better advice than judging them without knowing their whole story. And telling them: Well, this is probably as much your fault. Attitudes such as yours, are the reason why sometimes people are very scared and insecure of seeking help. Because they fear to be faced with judgement and blame for other's poor behavior.
