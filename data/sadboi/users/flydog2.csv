What is she, months ahead of him? She needs a big dose of humility and to stay out of their business.  If they needed Lala‚Äôs help they‚Äôd ask for it but she just decided it was her duty to get in on it."

If you have an outdoor car maybe don‚Äôt let it lick the inside of your nostril."

They might be on a machine and die.  They won‚Äôt get a proper goodbye.  They could die alone, body traumatized, on a machine.  I hate this attitude.  My father thought that way when he had a heart attack and *didn‚Äôt tell anyone*.  We found out many months later after he finally ended up having bypass surgery and severe kidney damage.  He felt terrible pain in his chest while working in the yard one day, so bad he fell to his knees.  He then went inside and laid down, I guess assuming that was it and he would die.  Well he didn‚Äôt and he suffered for months before we got him to a hospital, none of us knowing this had occurred.  He has had pneumonia repeatedly, has gone through so much and now he has dialysis three times a week because he destroyed his kidneys with out of control blood pressure for so long.  This all could have been easily avoided with regular medical care and not having such a stupid idea about how easy dying would be."
