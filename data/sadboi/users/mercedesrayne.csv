WomensHealth,fgk87d4,t1_fg0k7ek,1580859585.0,My gyno actually told me about it. I never heard of that procedure before. I was diagnosed with menagorrhia(sp?) basically bad heavy bleeding. I would see if maybe you can see another doctor and ask them about it. I'm sorry you haven't had much help so far. Good luck!!
WomensHealth,fg09xae,t3_ew5dvi,1580403356.0,"I had similar happen and I'm 32. Heavy heavy bleeding that would never stop. I had a procedure done called an endometrial ablation and it's changed my life. Its basically having the inside of the uterus burned and it grows scar tissue so you stop having periods, or they become very light. I recovered quickly and it wasn't very painful at all. my period has stopped completely. The only thing is if you want children it's not something you wanna do because it will make it impossible to get pregnant. Just food for thought. It was the best solution for me."

I get very shaky, my heart beats out of my chest, constant racing thoughts  and I cry til my cheeks are raw. if I had bothered to research back then I would have never started taking them. I'm too afraid to come off because I'm scared I'll have a seizure and die. Fun times."

WomensHealth,fbx28t2,t1_fbspgz3,1577166497.0,So far I've been taking progesterone because I cannot take anything with estrogen due to high blood pressure. And every time hysterectomy is mentioned the doctor always says because I've never had children I don't qualify. I've also said I never want them but still I hit a wall. It's so sexist makes me sick. Yet a man can just go get snipped but we can't get rid of this useless organ we don't want and causes us needless suffering.
