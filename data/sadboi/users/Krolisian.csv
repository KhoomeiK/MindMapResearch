What is a trap? A woman with a penis, Right? They have a woman‚Äôs name- goes by she/her, treated as such socially and everything

How is that not a trans woman. There is 0 distinction as every time this joke is made it goes ‚Äúfemale character has penis, ahh a trap, shit that‚Äôs gay, gross‚Äù. 

okay so in this joke a woman has a penis, thereby a trans woman- How is implying it‚Äôs cursed/gross/weird/gay whatever not transphobic? And implying a straight man who wants to have sex with us is getting ‚Äútrapped‚Äù and is gay

And the only reason they‚Äôd say that sex with a trans woman is gay or gross or that we are just ‚Äòcursed/weird‚Äô in genre is that they don‚Äôt actually see us as women

I know to you it seems like this is over sensitive bullshit but that is because you‚Äôre a man of whom‚Äôst lives a life where trans shit doesn‚Äôt matter

But there are other people out there in the world, and you should be mature enough to listen to them when they say a joke implies something about their existence that hurts them- and choose to make the oh so difficult sacrifice of having one less joke to make all the time (I know, so painful)"

chapotraphouse2,fad15da,t1_fabwkbo,1575952223.0,"I think it‚Äôs much more likely for him to be snarky at a perceived intangibility/impracticality in modern discourse around dialectics; While ontology really isn‚Äôt his field, I really doubt after all this time he ‚Äòjust doesn‚Äôt get it‚Äô. It is easy to take text too literally without vocality.

Zizek is kind of a silly dude, and while his ideas are fascinating he‚Äôs also really quite flawed (there is some kinda gross islamophobia in Violence); Chomsky had a hard time seeing him as anything other than a loud intellectual who wasn‚Äôt speaking with enough clarity for most who would stumble on him and so even if I disagree It‚Äôs not exactly surprising."
chapotraphouse2,fabjk3v,t1_fabifgi,1575924192.0,"It‚Äôs a good episode- And yea that‚Äôs mostly the gist of it I‚Äôd say

The thing about the discourse around dialectics is it is almost never discussed like that in such simple and naturalistic terms- Which I suppose is Chomsky‚Äôs criticism there

On top of that we love to talk about how important the dialectical process is but we tend to not apply it so deliberately to modern contexts- people talk about how foundational it is and never make a point of actually using it consistently"
chapotraphouse2,fabcu3b,t1_fab9tkc,1575921269.0,"While on the surface I can see how that comes off, I think what he‚Äôs trying to do is give a kind of glib criticism of how opaque the discourse around dialectics can be; as opposed to actually not understanding the concept

Which I can sympathize with, at least early on-  because while dialectics are not a difficult concept to understand; the keys to utilizing it and applying it to modern political action and economic analysis can be frustratingly unclear and locked behind far too much lingo and obscurity"
