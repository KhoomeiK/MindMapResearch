I saw a few people getting stuck in the middle because they didn't push themselves hard enough, I did NOT want to be that person, so I had to take a moment and gave it my all. I was also paranoid about being *that* unlucky person and having the harness malfunction and break on me and I will fall to my death into all the trees below.

Also I made both a good and bad mistake by looking down just to see what the forest below looked like it. Good because it was beautiful! Bad because it made my paranoia skyrocket even more when I realized how high I was."

I've tried visiting therapists and they always think there is some childhood trauma when there isn't. I had a good childhood, I wasn't abused or neglected or anything. I have a fucking good life with opportunities others don't easily have. But here I am, depressed. Like I am grateful and all, but why the hell can't my brain just be happy? Whenever something good or happy happens, my brain thinks something is *wrong* or starts feeling horrible about it. It's so stupid and I hate it."
