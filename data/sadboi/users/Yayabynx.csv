PublicFreakout,fp8sd57,t1_fp7bf7x,1588401400.0,"I trained Brazilian jiu jitsu at a gym in the south. I went to my car to put something away and saw Two random, older dudes, probably on drugs, getting into a fight in the parking lot. One of the guys pulled out one of those tiny slugger bats and started beating the other, giving him a 2‚Äù cut on his forehead. I walked up to them and told them to chill out... they calmed down to just yelling at each other... after a few minutes 4-5 guys came out from the gym to help...

Of those guys, there was one dude who always seemed a bit off, a nice guy, but just off.  Imagine someone born and raised in a rural town in BFE in his late-40s/early- 50s... Within seconds of coming outside he puts one of the dudes in a standing rear naked choke... 

He single-handedly stopped the fight because EVERYONE there was so flipping confused. The guy with the bat went from winning the fight to suddenly being choked... 

Moral of the story... given the opportunity and zero fucks... some people will Rambo out unnecessarily. ‚ÄòMurica"

We were four
We were four. Mornings came on and I tucked my shirt in. Gave a kiss on the cheek to my little girl, bothered my son a bit about his handsome face and looked at my wife, giving her thanks for making our family what it was. 

I got into the office and nothing out of the ordinary for a day. John mistook my email for an angry rant, the girl next to my desk did nothing but speak about her boyfriend and her insecurities about a potential affair, and my buddy Shol came by to pick up our documentation for the commercial shredder. We grabbed a cup of coffee and remarked about the way life has moved. To think we were young, four year olds looking for a mud cake to splash, to now cleaning mud cake splashes... 

Nevertheless a task I enjoyed. I would get home everyday and make my way up the stairs to get my working room set up. I would turn the lights to the dimmest level I could manage and begin crafting my passion projects. Some days I‚Äôd spend hours twisting and tying components together to make these intricate designs. I‚Äôd carve and lure reeds together making each sturdy knot bring about a new sense of security to the one before. 

But I guess I never saw it coming. My wife got cancer and she was taken from me within a few weeks. My son worked himself into a deep depression and committed suicide. My little girl was all I had left. I hugged her and kissed her every moment I got. I was ashamed and aware of the thoughts I had where God would not take her away too! He got her. Thankfully he got her. She was my angel. A mud splash from her would have given me ten joys. 

But now what? I‚Äôm growing older and the more I breathe in the air the more I remember. I sit down in my workroom gripping my arms around the seat and sigh. Sometimes I wonder if the sigh is an invitation to a deeper meditation. I‚Äôm scared to see what my mind is like when the constant flood of thoughts has stopped. 

I walked outside. Dropped to the ground. Pronounced dead at the scene. Fulminating heart attack. Age 42.

Last week was a good week. We visited their home and gave them a moment to let us appreciate them for what they do. 

We come by starved in the winters. There‚Äôs not much seed as the air is dry and the plants are coming back to life. We do well in this winter surprisingly but it takes a bit of planning to get it all together. Last week we had a couple encounters with a potential freeze but the vast sections of town holding warm exhausts and tubing to rest in keep us together. Literally and figuratively. 

Im guessing it‚Äôs not so bad. Something magical happens on this planet. Not even magical. Transcendent. You look at your life and come to gaze at us not understanding what we see inside. It‚Äôs you who doesn‚Äôt see. We‚Äôre the same you and I. You make reeds into a crafted bow. I do it too. Just takes me longer than it would have taken you. 

You gave me my family and a home. You‚Äôve fed us everyday. It‚Äôs the least we can do. Please kiss her more than once before you leave. I wish I had done that when I could. L√∂Crows don‚Äôt have lips. Hey"

Flavor was excellent. Delicious, lime and pine.

These are 2 .5g containers totaling 1g. 

The package was relatively harmless and you could not smell anything at all due to the thick glass and PU top on the glass. The packaging is a box and the label is super discrete. 

Comes with notice to law enforcement that the person receiving this has no interest in getting blasted and binge eating baby carrots while watching futurama. I‚Äôm not 24 anymore. However I am interested in a tasty,
