It's about the Gleb Morgue in Sydney Australia. 


I've been suicidal since I was about 12. And a book about handling people after death and the family viewing the body for the first time seemed like the last thing that would help out.
The stories stuck with me were the ones where the person has killed themselves. The families always had the worst reactions. It gave me a bit of perspective on how my actions and my mental health affect everyone around me.

I wouldn't recommend it if you're extremely sensitive however, it mentions child death (murdered) and the authors  own experiences with his suicidal thoughts which is brought up for a chapter."

I suggest you attempt to meet your mum in person, tell her your point of view and that you couldn't hide that from your best friend. If she persists then maybe a bit of a break from her, until she calms down at least, will be good.
