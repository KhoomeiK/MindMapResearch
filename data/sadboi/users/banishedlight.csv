3DS,fo3xo3b,t1_fnngz2f,1587494699.0,Mario Kart DS is the only one I have but I still play it to this day. The game is awesome and balloon battles were my favorite part of the game. I've played countless multiplayer matches against my brother and sister but they don't take care of their DSes as well so now I just play alone.

ImmersiveDaydreaming,fm56neo,t3_epwa4i,1585767303.0,When I was little I would sometime daydream in cartoon art styles occasionally but noe my daydreams are ultra realistic to the point where I will spend days researching to make sure my mermaids are realistic and stuff like that.
ImmersiveDaydreaming,fm55w3z,t3_eub7iw,1585766903.0,"I'm kind of the opposite. Whenever I see a nice looking person or people having fun or something in real life, I get super sad knowing I will never feel what they do. My daydreams are the closest thing I can get to that but yeah. I hate knowing my daydreams are just my imagination and I will never be able to actually live the events I imagine."

SuicideWatch,fm4xscx,t1_fm4wx7k,1585762713.0,I feel like I could fix the things wrong with my personality and stuff if I still thought it was worth trying but my physical self is stuck like this. My only hope that keeps me alive is that technology may one day advance enough to create a virtual world(like in the matrix) and maybe then everything will be ok.
SuicideWatch,fm2ovrs,t3_fsjj1d,1585702053.0,"I have been feeling this every year for the last few years. Don't listen to the feeling. You're age is just a stupid number.

MaladaptiveDreaming,ezf9mkx,t3_czjn4k,1567874804.0,I used to pretend to be characters from my daydreams in online games and even reddit.

depression,ez6gpu8,t3_czt00k,1567712056.0,I get you. I wanna just kill myself now. It's how it's going to end anyway.
depression,ez6e93n,t3_d05aec,1567711463.0,Pretty much what the other guy said I guess. Drinking isn't really helping. It's screwing you up worse. Also don't cheat on someone who loves you. Remember how it felt when that happened to you. I dunno what else is going on in your life but just take care of this right now. Start fresh. Maybe several times but don't give up. Maybe you will still feel bad but at least you won't also have to deal with this. Just take it one step at a time.
depression,ez6c9nu,t3_d05bmq,1567711161.0,Good luck :) I hope it goes well for you
depression,ez68eoc,t3_d04xz8,1567709927.0,Yeah sorry :/ This sub is more of a pit where we can all be sad together and not feel alone. We probably don't do much to help though.
depression,ez670s0,t3_d04sm8,1567709564.0,You aren't weird. I know exactly how you feel. I kept having that feeling until the day I drew blood for the first time. Then I felt bad that I wasn't doing it deep enough. Just don't start. Everybody kept telling me not to but I did it anyway so maybe you will too but it really doesn't help. It just form a weird kind of addiction where you know it's stupid and hate it but feel drawn to keep going. Good luck bro.

depression,eyz1nsr,t1_eyxrb91,1567607451.0,It's hard to help when you feel the same way any anybody who doesn't can't really argue against it as they don't know what we are going through :/

Minecraft,eywhj1a,t1_eywgx59,1567529634.0,I'm not as I only play on mobile and even on this I am not 100% sure as I don't really have the need to go up to the limit very often. If you want to check for sure. Just build a tower until you reach the limit and check your coordinates(how you do so will depend on what you are playing it on).
Minecraft,eywgq6a,t3_cz79im,1567529102.0,"Bravo my friend. I find the subtle creativity quite pleasurable and your take on the ""grass block"" and it's relations to players is portrayed in such a way that has never been seen in the artistic community. Looking closely you can see the slight irregularities in the lines which shows the thought and devotion you put into this. The symbolism between it and the many deficiencies of strengths the block possesses is simply superb, yet the empty background is almost certainly meant to portray the incontrovertible fact that the dirt really is what makes Minecraft what it is and that while the game would maintain its integrity with only dirt, it simply could not thrive the way it has without this underappreciated block. Again I congratulate you for this wonder piece of culture that will certainly be looked back in history and remembered for the ages to come."
