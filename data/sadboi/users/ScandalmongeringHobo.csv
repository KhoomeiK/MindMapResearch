I'm so sorry to hear he's doing this.  This is abusive.  Don't let yourself make excuses.  For every time he brings you down, affirm the truth that you deserve- you do- respect and good treatment as a human being.

Be careful.  He'll try to wear down your self worth.  Don't let him, even in the hard-to-notice ways, as best you can.

Try therapy, both couples AND for yourself.  Keep in mind that while couples therapy has a chance of helping, it's also a potential opportunity for him to gain more knowledge about your vulnerabilities to hurt you (if he's indeed abusive).  If he's a decent man who improves in therapy with you, great.  If he starts to use the information in those sessions to hurt you, you know his nature better.  Guard yourself adequately.  <3

If his ass isn't making an effort to improve, leave him.  Separate finances now.  If he IS an abuser, he will try to degrade your self worth and trap you further, making you feel like you can't leave him.  I'm so glad you're questioning these things early on and seeing how fucked up they are.  Don't let him do this to you.

Also, enlist people you love as support.  Tell them, ""I love so and so but he's started to do some unkind actions that I'm registering as potentially abusive.""  Call it out, say openly what it is.  Don't let him isolate you or let you think this is normal."
