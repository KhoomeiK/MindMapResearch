But I would really suggest you trying to be more open-minded towards the dog and maybe bring treats for it.

IKEA,flxphjj,t1_flxp7yd,1585587359.0,How exactly is making people self isolate putting them at risk? It's more risky having your employees constantly contacting many strangers throughout the day just so they can get money. if people are deciding not to self isolate when they got told to go on furlough then that's on them not the company. But it is on the company to treat all employees fairly and the fact that they're choosing to put the hand out team at risk is not treating all their employees fairly.

And you mentioned that you don't have a good diet so even if they did eat better then you, they could still have a bad diet. either way when I mentioned that they should look at what they eat, I meant pay attention to the carbs they eat because most people can't process carbs easily without doing a lot of exercise to burn those carbs. Or maybe processed sugar in certain things like normal ketchup. I'm not saying that they have a horrible diet but maybe something is affecting their body poorly that hasn't always been considered unhealthy food. Just maybe their bodies have a hard time processing something they're eating and they just don't know. But yes just because the people you know are trying doesn't mean that a majority of people that are overweight all try.

Maybe, their bodies don't like the type of foods that are putting in their bodies.  And I highly doubt they're exercising to actually get rid of it from what you told me. did you ever wonder why boobs are one of the first things to go when you lose weight?
