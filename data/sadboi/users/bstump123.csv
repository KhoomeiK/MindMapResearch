benzorecovery,fqpycbc,t1_fqpvrra,1589556203.0,Will do thanks again I appreciate it.
benzorecovery,fqpvngx,t1_fqpga9f,1589554811.0,Thanks I will.
benzorecovery,fqpg59y,t1_fqovpme,1589545537.0,Thank you. I will do that. I appreciate the help.
benzorecovery,fqnto12,t3_gftywc,1589501189.0,I have been on Klonopin for a total of 3 years now. At first was prescribed it and only took .5mg a day. I now take it without a prescription. I slowly over 3 years have worked my dosage up to 1-2 mgs a day. I sometimes do skip days between if I can without getting too much anxiety. Just wondering how long I should wait between lower my dosage and by how much (for instance weeks or lower it monthly). Also so I donâ€™t have prescription I canâ€™t swap to a different benzo to help with the taper. Mostly want to make sure I donâ€™t have a seizure. I think I can handle the withdrawals as I have went sometimes without it since I couldnâ€™t find any to get.
suboxone,fqezzl2,t3_gijsxu,1589316420.0,You can vape if it has no nicotine but my doctor told me nicotine is one thing that will make it not work as well as it should.
suboxone,fq7llh5,t1_fq7jqmb,1589148017.0,"No problem. I am doing a lot better getting energy back, sleeping better and yes sex drive is back to with my husband. Yea I know me too. Iâ€™m excited I am done with them as well. Thanks for asking."
suboxone,fpvo6z5,t1_fpvn4kr,1588948672.0,Thanks Iâ€™m going to and you do the same. Girl by the way hehehe. Last few days have been a lot better just some sleep disturbance as well.
suboxone,fpq8hck,t1_fppwe31,1588817298.0,Yea for me the first 6 days werenâ€™t bad at all. Yesterday was horrid though which was the 7th day. Felt really bad. Today has been better so hopefully just the one day was the worst. We shall see.
suboxone,fpoeh3a,t1_fpo9x7y,1588783132.0,Thank you I appreciate it!
suboxone,fpo968e,t1_fpo79p7,1588780540.0,Going good still not taking suboxone. Yesterday was a tough day though felt crappy all day. Kratom helped some but not much. Today seems to be a little better. Thanks for asking!
suboxone,fpelsaj,t3_gbkc31,1588550020.0,"So Iâ€™m on my 5th day now with no suboxone. This has probably been the worst day thus far for being low energy, muscle cramps and headaches. It was way worse at the beginning of the day. By around 7 pm I was feeing a lot better and am hoping tomorrow will be betterðŸ˜Š"
Anxiety,fpel2ic,t3_gczeuf,1588549619.0,Me. Gad here. Panic attacks.
kratom,fpcterc,t3_gcjjp8,1588512186.0,I stopped suboxone 4 days ago and this is for the second time. The first time I used kratom and am this time as well. Kratom is so much better than suboxone. On suboxone I always felt tired and unmotivated but not with kratom. I donâ€™t like suboxone at all makes me feel worse instead of better. You definitely are making the right choice with using kratom imo.
suboxone,fpb3na6,t1_fpb09yv,1588461423.0,"Well this was my second go around at taking it.  only reason I got back on it in the first place was due to a relapse I had last year except my dosage wasnâ€™t nearly as high this time. I got back on it for 3 months just wanted to use it long enough this time to get clean from opiates and make the cravings for them go away. I decided when I started back I wasnâ€™t going to be on it for years like before. Yes part of the reason I stopped was due to bad side affects. The first go around I didnâ€™t have them. I had a really fast heart rate, got headaches extremely bad, and it seemed to make my legs and joints swell and hurt. 

I thought about trying to switch to subutex but figured I would just go ahead and stop instead of prolonging it. So far I have felt better. Today so far has been the worst day but I know it will pass. I was clean before for 2 years before I relapsed."
suboxone,fp9x225,t1_fp8hzuo,1588436338.0,Yes I definitely wouldnâ€™t jump before you feel comfortable doing so. So far on my day 4 not feeling too bad just fatigued and body aches. I also have klonopine to help me as well which has been great at helping me sleep.
Anxiety,fp9m6a5,t3_gc6zrc,1588429626.0,Yea I agree 100%. Iâ€™m always afraid Iâ€™m dying anytime I have a weird pain or tightness in my chest.
suboxone,fp9ghdz,t1_fp8v2o2,1588425545.0,Yes the withdrawals do suck. I am glad to be off of it and I know it will get better. Good luck!
suboxone,fp9ga4y,t1_fp8h9rx,1588425391.0,I keep it to twice a day once in morning and once in the afternoon. Drinking a lot of water makes it work better for anyways.
suboxone,fp8h272,t3_gbzyak,1588392106.0,It does get better. This is my second time coming off suboxone. I jumped off at 4mgs and this is my 3rd day and it will get better for you. I also use kratom to help. With kratom usually less is more I take 3 grams at a time and it helps a lot. Hang in there you got this!
suboxone,fp86cfb,t1_fp85rym,1588384656.0,No problem lol. I figured it was your phone acting up. Hehe
suboxone,fp85o15,t1_fp7gir1,1588384163.0,Glad to help! Yes it definitely is a beast for sure!
suboxone,fp85lpj,t1_fp7zcg5,1588384113.0,Yes I know seems as though it does. I know a lot of mine is mental but yes I agree it doesnâ€™t feel like that.
suboxone,fp85c6q,t1_fp7gzxx,1588383918.0,Yes it definitely is!
suboxone,fp7hwb0,t1_fp7hgw6,1588370934.0,Thanks for the encouragement! I definitely am going to try.
suboxone,fp7gy5k,t1_fp7gq94,1588370423.0,Will do. Thank you for the encouragement!
suboxone,fp7gvuc,t1_fp7gfba,1588370389.0,Thanks! Glad to be inspiring. Yes I agree I wouldnâ€™t jump too quick if you ainâ€™t ready for it may make you relapse and take some every 6 days or so is better than doing that.
suboxone,fp7b0bb,t1_fp7a32c,1588367256.0,Thanks for the encouragement!
suboxone,fp79wgn,t1_fp783cu,1588366684.0,Yes I used it before coming off of suboxone and am going to make sure I am careful and donâ€™t become addicted to it just cause I have an addictive personality. I keep my dosage once a day so far at 2grams and thatâ€™s it. Thanks for the encouragement!
suboxone,fp79p9w,t1_fp77d6d,1588366580.0,Yes I am going to. Yes a lot of it is in my mind for me definitely so I need to just think positive and exercise and take some mood supplements for sure. Thanks for the encouragement!
suboxone,fp76gaz,t1_fp768qs,1588364917.0,Yes and I hope so. Thanks for the encouraging words!
suboxone,fp6yiq2,t1_fp6wvnu,1588360826.0,Yes itâ€™s definitely been more uncomfortable today than the others. I had some bad side affects on suboxone so I actually so far feel better off of them. I was on them years ago for 3-4 years and didnâ€™t want that to happen again was only on them for 3 months this time.
suboxone,fp6y5z8,t1_fp6wffq,1588360647.0,Will do. Thanks for the support!
suboxone,fp6y37r,t1_fp6rm6u,1588360610.0,Thanks man appreciate it! Yes I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll get worse but weâ€™ll see. I do feel better off suboxone than on it.
suboxone,fp6pg8t,t1_fp6i85k,1588356323.0,Yes I was on them the first time for 3 years and didnâ€™t want to be on it that long this time. This time I was only on them for 3 months and only got up to taking 8 mg in the beginning than went down to 4 and decided to go ahead and jump. I had a lot of bad side affects from it this time as well. So far I feel better off the suboxone.
suboxone,fp6p7c9,t1_fp6mkld,1588356201.0,Yea I just didnâ€™t want to be on them for years like before. I only slipped up for about a year with opiates and wasnâ€™t using near as much as the first time. The first time I lowered my dosage way down before stopping. Seems so far withdrawals havenâ€™t been that bad even though I jumped at 4mg. Also I never went higher than 8 mgs a day and was only on them about 3 months this time. Usually withdrawals for me have to do with length of time taking and how much I was taking.
suboxone,fp6edq1,t1_fp6e890,1588350897.0,Yes this is my second time stopping so I know everyone is different. Thanks for the advice!
suboxone,fp6e467,t1_fp6beca,1588350768.0,Yes I know the worst is yet to come unfortunately. Thanks!
suboxone,fp6e1xf,t1_fp68lm2,1588350738.0,It was planned I stopped at 4 mgs a day. Could have gotten myself lower on dosage before doing so but was ready to be done with it. Thanks!
suboxone,fp6dxlg,t1_fp67vwp,1588350679.0,Thanks I appreciate the support!
suboxone,fp67gee,t1_fp62y0y,1588347448.0,Maybe try GoodRx to help with the script. That is what I did and it is a lot cheaper than not using it.
Anxiety,fp00oi1,t3_gaicst,1588200289.0,Yes I have this all the time. Usually I lay down though and canâ€™t sleep even though I am exhausted.
suboxone,foyrbx2,t1_fosc57p,1588177742.0,So didnâ€™t stop on Tuesday like I had planned either but did today. So far of course donâ€™t feel any withdrawal just a little fatigue. Iâ€™ll let you know how 3rd day is cause thatâ€™s usually when the worst sets in.
suboxone,fosc0un,t1_fos9g8l,1588027767.0,I wasnâ€™t successful in not taking it today. I got in my head about it too much this morning and took my 4mgs. I plan on trying again tomorrow to not take any or at least take less. By Sunday at the latest is my goal to not take anymore again. The first time I stopped I used kratom and it worked wonders to help me get through it. Iâ€™ll let ya know if I am successful tomorrow at not taking any. Most of mine seems to be in my head figured I would feel bad if I didnâ€™t take it today hopefully I am stronger tomorrow.
suboxone,foop5yh,t1_foonyza,1587943522.0,"Yea mine was exactly the same as well, didnâ€™t use as much during the year when I relapsed. Thanks I do have some left so I may do that. I have an 8 year old I stay home with hehe. Not nearly as hard to take care of as a 1 year old though. I just know I donâ€™t want to be on suboxone as long as last time for sure. Seems the first go around my side affects werenâ€™t as bad. Yes I donâ€™t look forward to the sleepless nights. I just think I will feel better now off of them. Thanks so much for the advice."
suboxone,fonieye,t1_foncuj2,1587920095.0,Yes I know thatâ€™s what they act like around here as well. My insurance doesnâ€™t cover mine anyways have to use GoodRx. Mine seems pretty strict but we will see. Will do.
suboxone,fon16fc,t1_fols9kc,1587909767.0,Thanks!Yes I hope so too! Canâ€™t continue on the suboxone too many bad side affects.
suboxone,fon140w,t1_folp3zx,1587909718.0,Well I donâ€™t have a rash but am going to talk to him about it maybe without a rash having the side affects will be proof enough.
Anxiety,folc6j5,t3_g8414i,1587859118.0,Me to a t.
suboxone,fol9e3u,t3_g81a2z,1587857491.0,Yes I get nasty side affects just like you are talking about on the suboxone. Iâ€™m gonna talk my dr. Only problem is in TN I think they can only prescribe subutex to pregnant women but we will find out.
Anxiety,foksp4n,t3_g7vvs5,1587848210.0,Me too. Mine is always about my health too. I always think Iâ€™m having a heart attack or have some deadly illness. I try to just sit down and breath in and out and tell myself itâ€™s just the anxiety. This helps sometimes but not always. A lot of times it actually makes me have a panic attack. You are not alone. Sending good vibes your way.
suboxone,fok772w,t1_fok5ezm,1587836672.0,I am 38. Part of it I am sure has to do with my age hehe
suboxone,fok525l,t3_g7pcdz,1587835543.0,Yes I get this as well I think it is the sub. I am going to try lowering my dose.
suboxone,foh2k0u,t1_fogxjik,1587759800.0,Right now I take 8mgs a day. 4 in morning and 4 in the afternoon. I find I don't need the full 16mg but I  just save the extra. This time I have been on it for 2 months but I was on it probably for 3 years in 2015-2018. Got off of it but unfortunately went back to opiates after being clean for a year and had to get back on sub. The first time I took it I was not as overweight as now so I am guessing maybe that's why I never had the blood pressure problem first time. Which I could be wrong of course just seems to be connected.
suboxone,fogwkzd,t3_g7c1wo,1587757795.0,"Yes I think suboxone makes blood pressure high. I never had high blood pressure except when I was pregnant, even with being overweight but since starting suboxone I have been put on lisinprol because its making my blood pressure high. I also think it causes poor circulation as well."
suboxone,fodftv1,t1_fod9wmw,1587684159.0,Yes I feel the same like wtf. Hopefully it'll change after taking longer or so I am hoping.
suboxone,focxm3z,t3_g6pabs,1587677219.0,"I believe it is the naloxone as well. I took subutex a few years ago and got off of them for a year maybe and than started opiates again and had to get back on suboxone instead of subutex. Now they only give subutex in TN if you are pregnant. The first time I took it, it made me feel great. This time low energy and feel shitty all the time with depression and anxiety. Also here they will no longer prescribe gabapentin with suboxone."
suboxone,foct2nc,t3_g6gb8k,1587675469.0,I never get refills have to do monthly.
suboxone,focssky,t3_g6tc9x,1587675368.0,I'm on pill form it doesn't bother my stomach either except for constipation but I think pills are stronger in my experience.
suboxone,fo7pd4v,t1_fnu9y4d,1587582241.0,They will not give it with sub anymore in TN.
Anxiety,fo4pd9k,t1_fo4o72f,1587508647.0,"Thanks for the reply. I have been prescribed 5 mg twice a day. I am starting tomorrow, I was taking klonopin and wanted to get away from a benzo due to the chance for addiction as I was addicted to opiates before. Hopefully it helps me as it has you."
suboxone,fo3kjjb,t1_fns02er,1587488441.0,Maybe it is a law in TN that's where I'm from. Psychiatrists wont even see me because I'm on sub and my pcp won't prescribe klonopin. My sub dr told me this week it's because in TN it's a law that they will not prescribe them together.
Anxiety,fnzz3mq,t3_g4u8u4,1587403248.0,"Yes my anxiety is mostly about my health anyways, so I always think I'm having a heart attack. I take benzos, wish I didn't have to but it is the only thing that works for me. The non-benzos dont seem to make it go away at all, as I have tried them way before starting benzos."
Anxiety,fnxuhxc,t3_g3z40y,1587346605.0,"You are not alone. I wake up everyday and always think I have it. My anxiety is mostly health based anyways, always feel like I have something really bad wrong even though I am not sick (just super bad allergies and my anxiety.)My husband always tells me I would be super sick if I had it but most days with my anxiety it makes me feel like I am dying."
Anxiety,fnx8xqx,t1_fnuhdwn,1587333825.0,Thanks for comment. Mine is psychological anxiety unfortunately so it isnt helping.
Anxiety,fnwyy0j,t3_g4dr6i,1587328201.0,Yes I have this most days I don't even want to get out of bed because it is so bad. I feel like I am a different person than I was years ago. I have mostly health anxiety and always think I'm dying.
Anxiety,fnwy99j,t3_g4elqt,1587327813.0,Yes I am same way anxiety sucks. Hopefully you start to feel better. Sending positive thoughts your way.
suboxone,fnugiyj,t1_fnuagss,1587261565.0,Yes I am on suboxone and want a non narcotic. Hopefully the clonidine will kick in and do the trick.
Anxiety,fntzfa1,t1_fntz9d2,1587251545.0,Thank you. Does it take a while before it works fully? I just started it today and so far doesn't seem to be doing anything.
suboxone,fnswntp,t1_fns40u2,1587230214.0,Thanks I will check into those two and talk to my dr.
suboxone,fnqogp8,t3_g1h0ub,1587168751.0,I have oral thrush from the pills as well. I think it is just suboxone that causes it because I was off of it for a year and it went away. I went back to suboxone again to get off opiates again and now I have the oral thrush again.
suboxone,fnqhlmu,t1_fnqhfu3,1587164768.0,Yes I know I am no longer going to get illegally I will just have to try and manage until I can find someone. Thanks so much for the help!
suboxone,fnqgu17,t1_fnqg34o,1587164329.0,Yes the place I go is supposed to be specialized for addiction but he is the one who said only a psychiatrist could prescribe it. The other dr that did prescribe it was in another city that is part of the reason I stopped there I actually stopped suboxone for a few years but eventually went back to opiates and so had to go back to a suboxone dr. I was getting the klonopin illegally but want to get it legitimately because I have such bad anxiety.
suboxone,fnqg3d7,t1_fnqbli6,1587163918.0,Yes I was on celexa for years but it made me gain so much weight and I thought I no longer needed it so I stopped taking it. I may need to start it back and see if that helps along with clonidine or maybe ask my dr about the propranolol.
suboxone,fnqethf,t1_fnqdt4n,1587163199.0,Thanks I will talk to my dr about those. I have never been prescribed either of those so maybe I can have luck with them.
suboxone,fnqe5e5,t1_fnqde7z,1587162832.0,I am in the Tennessee area and seems here they are a lot stricter on prescribing benzos. My primary dr can't even prescribe them to me. I never start out asking for benzos I always try the other ones and than tell them they don't work which they never do. Hopefully I can figure something out or find someone understanding.
suboxone,fnqdp1t,t1_fnqczpk,1587162579.0,Yes I was thinking of doing the same because honestly I need something for anxiety more than needing suboxone. I have been told now only psychiatrists can prescribe klonopin as well.
suboxone,fnqcrmt,t1_fnqcc82,1587162081.0,Thanks that is what I will have to do and can hopefully find someone. Yes I have tried xanax and it works so much better than klonopin but klonopin is the only other thing I have found that helps because I have tried several non-benzos with no luck. I also have severe anxiety and panic attacks unfortunately.
suboxone,fnmv00f,t1_fnmuhxj,1587078678.0,Maybe I will try with pills that way than since you have had success with it. I agree they do taste very bad and take forever to dissolve. I mostly get pills over strips due to price difference.
suboxone,fnmsjsx,t1_fnmr0u0,1587077338.0,Thanks I may have to try this after I swap to the strips. I would be afraid to with the pills may end up swallowing it by accident or something.
suboxone,fnl16sd,t1_fnkggal,1587044863.0,Yes that does help thanks. Yeah unfortunately here it has naloxone in it but must just be suboxone I will drink more water and hopefully that'll make them stop. I'll also try splitting my dose as well.
suboxone,fnjwwuq,t1_fnjn4s2,1587008938.0,That maybe what brand mine are I'm not sure I'll have to check and may try swapping to strips to see if they work better.
suboxone,fnjwrad,t1_fnjo349,1587008831.0,Yeah I believe it is the naloxone as well. I was on suboxone before for like 2 years and stopped but had to start back. I didn't get the headaches before so I would think they hopefully will go away after using longer. I wish I could get subutex but they only give them to you now if you are pregnant.
suboxone,fnjwl9m,t1_fnjj66v,1587008717.0,Yes mine is side of my temples as well and smoking seems to make it worse. Thank you.
suboxone,fnjd1jc,t1_fnjcsb1,1586996514.0,"Thank you, my doctor let's me choose as well. I may try this method with the pill and see if it works better."
NoStupidQuestions,fmu3q26,t1_fk9ac4d,1586384003.0,Why am I weird? You don't even know me.
