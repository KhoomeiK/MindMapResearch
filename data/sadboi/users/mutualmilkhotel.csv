BipolarReddit,fpw8n7o,t3_gftmhn,1588959139.0,"i‚Äôve got bipolar 1 and a restrictive eating disorder. i also have a friend who has bipolar 2 and bulimia. 

i already had an ed before i was diagnosed with bipolar, but i restrict a lot more whenever i‚Äôm hypo/manic (most of the time without consciously restricting and it just being what happens). when i‚Äôm depressed i tend to eat more, but am aware and constantly track it and feel worse. 

my ed also got really bad when i was on zyprexa bc of how easy it is to gain weight, so i just stopped taking it even though it worked great. i also cope with a lot of my daily bipolar symptoms through my eating disorder habits too. kind of like a comfort thing?? who knows lmao"
