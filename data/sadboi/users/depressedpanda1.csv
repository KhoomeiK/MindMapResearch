sonos,fr358sc,t1_fr2skv7,1589850207.0,Will the microphones on the Sonos Ones still be usable along with Sonos Beam?
sonos,fr2tc7m,t1_fr2skv7,1589843499.0,Thanks! That's so dumb...
zoloft,fpxairj,t1_fpxablo,1588978843.0,I know exactly what you mean. Ride that wave!
zoloft,fpxaew9,t1_fpxa46q,1588978784.0,It's kinda a vicious cycle. Depression drains your energy and motivation to keep track of daily routine. The more depressed you feel the worse you are at keeping track.
zoloft,fpwen2g,t1_fpweet1,1588962109.0,Honestly taking your meds at the same time every day really helps balance all the mood more.
depression,fpbrq9v,t1_fpbrcg8,1588477065.0,So true!!!! But I've learned to not give a shit about what other people think. Combating depression is really hard as it is. Putting any weight on negative opinions about myself is only gonna make it worse. As long as I am kind and fair towards other people then I'm just gonna ignore other people's opinions about me unless they actually have some merit.
depression,fpbkob2,t3_gcheox,1588472220.0,This is one the of truest posts I've seen on there. It is a constant battle. The trick for me is to accept that it's okay to not be okay. You really can't win every time.
graphicscard,foz9mlq,t3_gaf1r1,1588186986.0,I'd go with RTX 2060 Super. Chances are your rig would bottleneck a RTX 2070 or above.
zoloft,foj5pmk,t3_g7p28d,1587809423.0,So true ðŸ˜‚
depression,fnpb23b,t1_fnpanuv,1587142370.0,"You have to understand that people are not always in the right headspace to offer support, especially depressed individuals. If you become dependent on their support, you both could end up in a really bad situation and ruin your friendship. I had to learn that the hard way."
depression,fnpacji,t1_fnp8bgr,1587142013.0,"I think you might be mixing fun energy with positive energy. Somone can be fun but negative. Someone who is positive and fun is rare to find but they do exist.

I find watching Sam Cushing's youtube channel super helpful in keeping a positive attitude and mental state at times of depression: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCckxTseOtNqU0oipfiviMkQ"
depression,fnpa5uf,t1_fnp7ubh,1587141920.0,"My honest opinion would be to love yourself first. I know it's REALLY hard to do when you are depressed but try to find ways and things to do to validate yourself. In my case, it's extremely mentally detrimental to seek validation from people who don't give it."
depression,fnp8okf,t1_fnp5hr9,1587141173.0,"I actually used ""exhume"" on purpose because a person would have to dig positive emotions out of me when I'm depressed."
depression,fnp3c2k,t1_fnoznlg,1587138495.0,"I resonate so much with the ""keep yourself afloat"" philosophy. We all have to practice self-love first and take care of ourselves before we can help others."
depression,fnoz9uq,t1_fnoz161,1587136417.0,"So much truth in that! It just sucks up all your mental and physical energy as well as your ability to think and socialize. Depression also does not discriminate. Everyone is at risk and you never know when it's going to hit you and it's a constant battle to keep it at bay. 

Hang in there! ðŸ’ª"
zoloft,fn6oa75,t3_fzxvz6,1586703962.0,"It really works differently for everyone. I had a burst of hypersexuality when I first started then it dissipated after the first 2 days. I generally have a lower libido and sex drive on Zoloft. It does take longer to reach climax when masturbating but I don't have any trouble with getting an erection. You might want to consult a pharmacist regarding taking additional medication with Zoloft. I wouldn't trust anyone's opinion on Reddit.

Hang in there! ðŸ’ª"
depression,fn6kmy0,t3_fzov76,1586701637.0,That's such a stupid statement. Obviously there is no reason to be depressed. As if that's a choice. Depression doesn't discriminate.
zoloft,fm7v0zq,t1_fm7utjn,1585837349.0,Huh. Never seen it in capsule form. You can probably just take the particles out of the capsule and divide it up quarterly.
zoloft,fm7uoen,t1_fm7se32,1585837137.0,Get a pill cutter. Just take a quarter of the pill to start and slowly ramp up.
depression,flydjqz,t3_frqbpi,1585600146.0,Depression causes bad perspectives not the other way around.
depression,flp1f2h,t1_flp0joz,1585349730.0,Fuck depressio man
depression,flmm1zy,t3_fpnaid,1585287869.0,Dude. That feeling is so real. I feel like my default solution to deal with anything upsetting is just to watch a sad tragic movie and cry my eyes out.
depression,fl7mtq6,t1_fl7me1r,1584905008.0,I don't think that's selfish. You have to take care of yourself before taking care of others. Helping someone when yourself is in a comproised mental state could do more harm than good. Self-love is important. We only have enough headspace to process so many things. Battle with depression is a long and constant one. Hang in there!
depression,fl4l3y9,t3_fmgn5f,1584815860.0,The only thing I would say is to learn to be kinder to other people. If you don't feel like texting because you are going through depression yourself then say so so the other person doesn't think you are ignoring them.
zoloft,ffs1yr1,t3_euttx4,1580171158.0,I think what you are describing is Depersonalization/derealization. That tends to happen to me whenever I have a day of depressive mood.
depression,fdpfgvv,t1_fdpf9zw,1578627258.0,Thank you. <3
depression,fdpemlx,t1_fdpeedj,1578626656.0,I feel like us being flaky is almost out of consideration for the friends. Most people wouldnâ€™t want to hang out with someone who just mops around. I havenâ€™t found a friend like that and sadly I donâ€™t think I ever will.
depression,fdpdx69,t1_fdpdkbv,1578626160.0,I honestly just want to lay in bed all day and not talk to anyone most of the time. When I do feel like hanging out or contacting a friend then itâ€™s too late because I have ignored everyone for too long. It take so much effort to even pick up the phone to reply to texts sometimes. Depression can seriously be paralyzing physically and emotionally.
depression,fdfenyw,t3_ekw3j2,1578359918.0,What a bitch. You deserve better than her. If that's all it took for her to leave you then you probably dodged a bullet. Hang in there. :)
depression,famka8t,t1_famfoiv,1576205907.0,There is always adoption...
depression,f9h66tx,t1_f9h640l,1575309736.0,Seriously! It feels like OCD almost.
zoloft,f8vn1ld,t1_f8vmh34,1574873115.0,That's awesome. I have the same problem. I tend ruminate on negative thoughts nonstop. It was debilitating but I'm somehow able to block out those thoughts with ease right now. I'm currently on 25mg and going on 50mg after a week. It's just nice to actually feel happy again. I hope this feeling of happiness lasts for the both of us.
zoloft,f8vm4n7,t1_f8vm03o,1574872537.0,"It feels strange to be finally happy and not have that brain fog, isn't it? What dosage are you on?"
zoloft,f8ti9ik,t1_f8tgwgs,1574803953.0,I'm starting with 25mg and increasing the dosage to 50gm in a week.
zoloft,f8tfc8c,t1_f8tdwle,1574802196.0,I didn't expect Zoloft to take effect this quickly but I'm glad it did. This is a pleasant surprise I guess. haha
zoloft,f8tdquq,t1_f8tdn3e,1574801257.0,Yes! I had a cup of coffee this morning. Does coffee make you horny while on Zoloft? lol
zoloft,f8tcsev,t1_f8tc7ny,1574800689.0,You are correct sir. It had been a while. I just hadn't had the desire to until today. lol
depression,f8nmpx4,t1_f8nmg1a,1574647758.0,"Honestly, 2 great friends who are willing to be there for you are so much more than a bunch of ""friends"" who vanish as soon as shit gets hard. I wish you a swift ride to real happiness."
depression,f8azxwp,t1_f8azurm,1574421053.0,Kudos to you. I finally couldn't fake it anymore and basically had a breakdown in front of everyone. Now I just wanna curl up in a corner and die.
depression,f8au9fz,t3_dzy2m5,1574412211.0,"I have definitely struggled through the same scenario. The thing is everyone is just too busy worrying about themselves to have the mental bandwidth to notice someone else's problem. 

Everyone has their own shit to deal with. Sometimes it's not personal. It's just hard to look past the surface behavior of everyone. 

Depression fucking sucks. It makes you focus on all the negative aspects of any interaction you have with anyone then you just go home and ruminate about all the little mistakes you made afterwards. It's a vicious fucking cycle that's impossible to break out of."
depression,f8at8em,t3_dzrccf,1574410695.0,Too numb to care about anything half of the time and then too depressed to formulate sentences to communicate to other people what it's like going through depression.
depression,f74oq56,t3_duda1u,1573405802.0,Happy birthday!
