witchcraft,fqg99lr,t1_fqb7wiv,1589340748.0,"The theory goes like this:

A) As crystals/stones are physically far simpler and have no need to modify the world around them, they have considerably less magickal power than humans do. This means it is extremely easy to fool yourself into thinking it does anything at all by placebo. Books like the crystal bible make this the norm, not the exception. Second, that lack off power means they are harder to perceive the energy of, and will have far lower success rates magically than say a Rune. This explains why not everyone can feel their energy, even among psychics. You need to be more sensitive and perceptive to pull it off. Also, this is why they seem unreliable as heck, unless their power is amplified.

Amplification Occurs mainly through 5 methods; charging with sun/moon/earth energy, charging with your own power, resonance with your nature (a Crystal that resonates with your true nature will cause both you and the crystal to be more powerful when you interact, often to a significant degree.), crystal grids (though almost no one does these right,, I'll get to that later), and enchantment (which isn't really amplification, but bears mentioning.)

You'll notice that witches and crystal healers frequently suggest using these methods.

B) Crystals are chemically vastly simpler than humans. Between our varying biology, highly variable psychology, and v spiritual nature we cannot entirely predict what effect a Crystal will have on any given person, though science can yield workably accurate predictions. Lithium crystals tend to be beneficial for individuals with bipolar disorder, and individuals with iron deficiency are likely to benefit from Hematite (pretty much pure iron.)

You can also figure out the elements a Crystal has through science extremely reliably. All crystals and stones are the earth element, as they are literally pieces of earth. In the eastern system,, some would be metal. And usually they are earth with a second, third and sometimes fourth element though they are distinctly less powerful an alignment than earth. Labradoritr is earth and fire, limestone earth and water with a little death energy-it is made of the skeletons of microscopic creatures after all!

However, because they have little power its way too easy for humans to project the elements they think it should have on to the stone, and they experience that instead.

And while we can accurately determine the elemental alignment, we can't yet say what a Crystal absolutely will do. Only what it might do, between its elements, physical composition and the user. Ultimately, most humans need to figure this out for themselves and the crystal can affect them differently as they grow.

Crystal grids are not done right because most have nothing to move the energy between stones- you need at Least ink,, Ideally copper wire. (copper is an ideal conductor of electricity, so the same holds true for stones or any other type of energy you might use.). Just arranging stones in a pattern is totally insufficient.

Second, you need to have a sufficient mastery of geometric and numeric magick; shapes and numbers are more powerful and effective than stones by far, so they can effectively harmonize, amplify and change the stones energy If used right.

But you'll want to use basic designs at first, and stay away from more complex/flowery ones.

Finally, you need to use stones that actually resonate. Again, science is the best predictor here- Ruby and Sapphire actually resonate very well, because they are essentially the same- Corundum, just slightly modified.

Those are some basics, I need to shower and I feel like it's probably better if I let you process that before I go much further. The next subject is how Crystals teach you about the earth element, and how that affects the ways in which they manifest.

I also need to explain that crystals do not necessarily stimulate Chakras or benefit humans in the slightest.

They are best used as a path to wisdom more than a direct magickal tool, based on my research."

Out of curiosity, what bothers you about tumeric lattes? I've seen them but they aren't handled in any way other than ""hey, tumeric is good for you.""

Personally, I define cultural appropriation much the way you do; it's ripping away small parts of the culture and trying to utilize the Cultural connection to promote it (this is exotic! This is the wisdom of another culture you think is wiser than you!)  but without actually understanding or respecting the culture. Its a shitty version of cultural integration.

I do have to ask, because India really brings this aspect of cultural appropriation into clear focus; does it ever bother you to see black women drinking those tumeric lattes? See black women or men doing yoga? They can bel every bit as culturally appropriative as white people. Does that bother you? Would that bother you? What about Chinese or Japanese appropriating your culture? You speak of white people only, but they are all equally capable of appropriation, are they not? Realistically, Indians like yourself would also be capable of appropriating other cultures too, correct? You could in theory appropriate Haitian Voodoo, as an example.

And it's not true that white people never need to fear for their lives, or fear being murdered in broad daylight. That's -generally- true, but not always. A white person in parts of California will be swiftly mugged and beaten, often to death, or just shot. There are places where white people do live in fear, even in their own homes. And have you heard about the Irish, by any chance? They have suffered horribly and I believe Irish still live in a very unstable situation.

You mentioned the colonization of India; do you blame white people as a whole for that? I'm sure you are aware that it was Britain that colonized you, not white people as a collective. 

Personally, I suspect, especially based on the examples you shared, that cultural appropriation is not done by race, but by business. Appropriation makes money, and anything that makes money, no matter how heinous, will be done. If you looked, I'm certain you could easily find members of other races appropriating your culture ( which is a very rich culture, I'm sad it's treated the way it is by so many. It has incredible depth and beauty!) and often for the same reasons."

SASSWitches,fq8s58u,t1_fq8bayx,1589173993.0,"I agree that racism is a problem, and that words and definitions do migrate over time. I also agree that the conflict between racists and inclusive pagans is causing a divide in the community.

I enjoyed the article too, but I don't believe it addresses my original point; Racists are not -intending- to divide the community, that's what they are doing. Its not their goal, but a consequence of their actions, the opposition's actions, and the circumstances. If there were no one to oppose their views,, there would be no division and that is the state they strive for; peace and unity under their banners.

None of the racists in the article were expressing a desire for division, but for unity and purification. Conflict with other races, yes, but not within paganism.

You do make good points about TERF, but I have to admit I find that definition something of a redefinition itself. Precise, which I like, but TERF is undoubtedly an insult and is used that way; it need not be any more true than calling someone a shithead, but it has a more powerful, social stigma attached to it.

And while I can see how ""gender critic"" might sound bizarre to you, TERF sounds objectively more bizzare. If someone had no knowledge of either terms meaning, and they walked into 2 people having an argument, if they heard someone called a ""gender critic"" to condemn them it would make sense far more readily than ""TERF"" which would require explaining the acronym, probably what radical feminism is, and trans exclusionist. Which is part of why its being misused to demonize; it's been established that, throwing loaded language (short terms that have a great deal of data/concepts behind them) at people causes their brains to get bogged down processing it, and this is in fact a commonly employed tactic of cults. That's not to say calling someone a TERF (especially correctly) means they are cultists; just to demonstrate that its not exactly above board.

I believe it is important to distingish Between definitions evolving/migrating and being misused. A good example is recent use of the term ""violence"". Violence for a very long time meant physical harm; if things got violent, health was impaired and lives/property were damaged, taken or in danger.

However, a relatively small group has begun using it to mean ""anything that causes emotions that are less than pleasant"". So when they talk about ""violence"" people initially react to the situation as though physical Violence was Done, Which is often advantageous to attempts to gather sympathizers.

The overall definition has not has not changed, but it's still used in an inaccurate way by a small group thanks to how it Manipulates human psychology.

And why did TERF drift? when you get down to it, they drift because they were misused repeatedly, and that often does happen in an effort to demonize someone. At one point square was a good thing, it later became an insult.

Finally, at no point did you address the point I made that people who are not gender critics do get labeled TERF's, which establishes clearly it's a tool by which people are silenced, marginalized and demonized. Its emotionally charged as hell, so it makes a great tool for using the ""ad hominem"" logical fallacy."

SASSWitches,fq7jhv2,t1_fq46yi4,1589147208.0,"Quoting American sniper? Nice. Interesting movie, even though I almost completely disagree with it. The quote you shared is certainly problematic- there are far more than 3 types.

The thing is, I don't think TERFS are an exact equivalent to these people; for 2 main reasons. 1, the label TERF strictly speaking should only apply to radical feminists, but it's applied to people who are not radical feminists or feminists at all. 2, More troubling, it's not even applied only to those opposed to Trans, but to anyone that is sufficiently disliked by pro-lgbtq individuals. Exactly like how the JoyofSatan neo-nazis call anyone who doesn't 1,000% agree with them kike's/jews/infiltrators. 

There are similar problems with antifa labeling people they merely dislike as nazis; in a way, it's doing the same thing the original quote was doing and trying to force everyone into categories that demonize them instead of trying to honestly engage with them.

I've rarely, on the other hand, heard the term ""sheep"" used without at least some validity. Mainly because most of the population, and even American sniper, doesn't consider sheep really bad. I mean, yeah, you Don't do much, but sheep are still useful, contributing members of society. Nazis, racists and TERFS are treated like the scum of the earth in contrast.

Also, they aren't ""trying to divide"" communities. That's a very gross mischaracterization of their intentions, which are either more complex or simpler, but almost never to Divide a community. The goal is usually to simply persuade others to adopt their way of thinking, which is what their opponents, much like yourself, are trying to do. 

But that mischaracterization is a symptom of how badly you and others are demonizing your opponents; if you really respected them you'd at least try to accurately ascertain their intentions. 

Instead, saying they are ""trying to divide communities"" makes them sound like they are agents trying to accomplish a sinister master plan. It sounds like something out of a conspiracy theory.

Now, it is true that dividing the communities is an -effect- of their actions, but it is not the goal. They don't want the community divided anymore than you do, you both want a unified community... Just unified according to the ideals you cherish."
daemonology,fq6exrf,t3_ggz76y,1589130208.0,"Welcome! Thanks for asking!

First, daemonology is not entirely safe; no magick or spirituality ever truly is. That said, there exist 2 schools of thought here on how to stay safe. The first is the solomonic methods, which basically involve creating a huge geometric design with the names of God in it to keep you seperate from that daemon,, and repeatedly using those names to torture/threaten that daemon to try and Force it to obey/appear/talk.

I do not agree with this approach personally, I follow the other school of thought: Treat the Daemons with honesty and respect. If you believe daemons are able to do What you cannot, it's more logical to treat them respectfully instead of being an abusive asshole.

Still, Mages report success and danger with both methods, and you'll hear about both so it's important to let you know about both off the bat.

The thing is, neither method is totally safe. The solomonic method has Andras angry enough that he got a reputation for killing the ones who ""summon"" or coerce him to appear via these methods. However, I've used the More respectful methods and I've had a wonderful relationship with Andras- He has taught and guided me greatly in magick.

Now, as to your question about what evocation is- evocation is calling forth a particular possibility, working to increase the likelihood it will occur. After all, any daemon could in theory appear at any time to you, but evocation is about calling out to one particular daemon and requesting their presence. Evocation is external and polite- your efforts are meant to aid them in appearing or entice them (with a favorite food, drink or maybe a ciggarette) to appear.

Invocation is internal- here you invite the daemon inside yourself, merging with them or letting them posses you to some degree. This is not without dangers, as it gives them total access to you, but it's also extremely beneficial if done right. Explaining it is almost a treatise in itself.

Summoning is often considered the same as evocation, but I prefer not to use the term as it involves force/cumpulsion. Getting summoned to court, for example, is not something you want to do, but it will have a bad consequence if you do not obey. So when using the Solomonic method/schools of thought, you are absolutely summoning the daemon, often to you detriment imo.

3- Well,, What do you want to learn?, Daemons are teachers, First and foremost. So think of what you wish to learn and seek a daemon who will be able to teach you. You can also look at all the sigils of the goetic daemons. You'll find some that call to you, some are silent, and some You'll get an averse/bad feeling about. Those you should avoid for the time being, but if you get a good feeling that is an indication this particular daemon wants to talk/interact with you, And is an excellent place to start.

If you can't perform that exercise, I recommend Asmodeus; Asmodeus is an excellent Daemon to call upon at the beginning, I've worked with Asmodeus personally. Be very respectful, Asmodeus demands complete respect, but he gives it in turn. If you know how to Be respectful of Asmodeus, you'll be well prepared to respectfully and reasonably safely interact with any other daemon.

In my experience and research, Daemons are divine beings close to Humanity that want to help us grow and improve. So in that regard I consider them ""safe"" where I would consider the fae/good folk ""dangerous""- daemons are fundamentally Benevolent towards Humanity amd very deeply understand us, so even if a daemon inflicts pain or suffering, it will be beneficial on at least a few levels. The Good Folk,, on the other hand, are alien to us so their favor isn't necessarily beneficial to us, and they aren't fundamentally invested in our growth and improvement the way that daemons are so I'm more trusting of daemons than other entities.

Kik, discord, all are pretty great.

The other thing you should do is get a good grasp on how to find a good coven.

Being a skilled witch and being a good leader are by no means the same, so it's common to find very power hungry witches. Or just very shittily run organizations that make everyone suffer.

Covens usually deal with More intense magick, so oaths of secrecy and never to harm each other are commonplace; however,, while they are necessary ( I'm not about to teach people how to curse without a few assurances and safeguards in place, and covens can get pretty intimate so even if you don't need to worry about social stigma at being outed, a pissed off coven member can do a lot of damage by spreading info.) It is important to realize those same safeguards can also enable a fuck ton of abusive behavior.

And you'll almost never know how bad it is until you've gotten in too deep.

Soo... Taking time to figure out watning signs and cult mentality are quite helpful.

If someone doesn't really have an opinion of you, and you cast the spell, it can influence them to have a positive bias towards you- they will observe and pick up on traits they like/love about you, and ignore/miss traits and details they don't like/hate. Takes a Little time but works very well; unless they are already in a relationship, but that just takes more time.

The trouble with targeting a specific person is that usually we have tried other means of getting with them and kinda ""burned"" the bridge and given them a bias against us. That's harder to overcome.

It you want to compel love, it's wise to make sure it's temporary. If you make it last forvee you end up with a yandere, which is pretty scary. But you can usually indulge for a few weeks or a Month without too much trauma on either side.

It helps most if you are a genuinely good person. The better the experience they have with you, the better you present yourself, the easier it is to establish a good relationship and to make the spell work. Studying how to establish Rapport is really helpful.

The more valuable you are as a person the better, as well. By ""valuable"" I mean how many skills/talants/hobbies/experience do you have? The more you are and can do/enjoy the better you'll be.

Using the love spell to give yourself opportunities for growth is really helpful too.

If you target someone from a different walk of life and let them teach you about their life and viewpoint, you'll grow and they will like you more because you listened to them and
 Embraced their life and passions.

Also, never underestimate the power of more Pavlovian spells. With practice you can make their genitals more sensitive, or induce arousal...and you can set it to occur when they pay attention to you/you are around. Good conditioning can have powerful effects.

The better you can understand your target and what they want, the better you can give them what they want. Doing so helps a lot too.

I suspect love spells fail for the following reasons:
1)Ignorance, willful or otherwise, Regarding our basic animal nature and psychology.
2)Personal Hang-ups and delusions about what love is and should be
3)Objectifying the target
4)trying to make the spell last too long.
5)Lack of self confidence
6) believing these spells won't work/are immoral
7) letting yourself use these to justify being a shitty partner.

These are issues because, starting with 4, it's easy to make someone love you for a week or a few months, but it takes considerably more power and skill to go forever or even a few years. And if you can't let them go, your spell won't do nice things to them. Tends to make them obsessive, and you won't be able to let the spell work.

6) is obvious, if you don't think they will work or are wrong, you will get a self inflicted punishment or it just won't work.

7) Too many use such spells to circumvent the need to actually care for your partner, which is a major problem.

3)if you let yourself forget that you are dealing with a complex human who has their own wants and desires and lusts, you won't be able to influence those desires effectively.

2) if you don't understand what love actually is, it's much harder to make work because your spell will be trying to make them go above and beyond to fulfill an unrealistic notion of love.
KISS if you want a kiss- Keep It Simple, Stupid!

5) needs no explanation

1)As much as we often despise pick up artists, we also tend to wonder why they are successful. Its because they are very clear about what they want and what they are dealing with. Animals do not often spend Much time choosing mates- So, they focus on the animal aspects and master working on those, so even if you know what they are doing you'll still be attracted, far more so if you don't know.

Humans are animals, and it's the animal instincts that govern Passion in most scenarios, love and lust included. If you don't realize and accept this, you'll have a harder time making the spells work.

And, humans may very well be polyamorus by nature; it would explain why we cheat and can't stop looking around. 

I've got a few stories, but I felt like offering a more simplified list of principals to go off because it's a very different approach that has produced very different results for me compared to 99% of witches. So if you want a story time demonstrate a particular principal I've suggested, let me know- it's either a personal experience or that of someone I know."
witchcraft,fpljpt4,t1_fpkvh9c,1588713937.0,"I largely agree!

witchcraft,fpih9ef,t1_fph4vch,1588640870.0,"Meteor showers are interesting; one use of them is to charge any meteorites and tektites that you might have. (tektites are glass created from Meteor impacts- the heat and energy released turns parts of the earth into glass.) 

Arguably, working with meteor showers is a more recent magickal thing, since we didn't really understand them until recently and what we do understand invalidates old lore. These are not falling stars, but falling rocks.

Its a great time for more earth bound witches to work with void/space energy, alien and celestial energy since the earth is getting a visible influx of it. Meteors are the only genuinely alien things most humans will ever touch or see, after all.

So this is a great time to contemplate the alien, the strange, the higher, as well as the deeper origins of the universe and all.

It is a useful time to work with fire energy, as the meteors will bring more of that too.

Don't discount the effects of wishing on a meteor, you could build a ritual around the process to enhance it more. 

Meteors are a very interesting combination of void, earth, wind and fire energy, and arguably light; since they lack an atmosphere like a planet would have, meteors are imbued with the light and radiation of the stars more potently than a planet which is shielded from the light and radiation.

This is a great time for travel based magick too, as meteors are eternal travelers and remind us that we are all on a great journey. If you wish to move or go on a journey, now is a great time to cast magick to make it happen.

Finally, celestial/angelic magick will be at it's most potent thanks to this event... So anyone who works with angels, heaven Deities, high magick will find tonight quite powerful. Same with star deities Thanks to the deeply embedded notion These are falling stars, And they certainly bring us closer to the stars than normal.

It would be very beneficial to carry a Meteorite or Tektite tonight if you live In the northern hemisphere too.... Though these energies can be harnessed from anywhere In the World If you know what you are Doing.

Any galaxy based magick would be more effective tonight too. Not necessarily planetary magick, but it might be depending on your mindset.

This is a great time for magick intended to catalyze Evolution, particularly of a massive scale, as meteors are the catalyst for evolution par excellence, causing massive change very quickly, precisely ending and ushering In a New era and way of life- they thus correspond to the death and judgement cards of the major arcana.

That makes meteor showers excellent times for initiation, of most types, but especially highly powerful and geared towards higher/celestial and deeper magick.

As for baneful magick, this is an excellent time to wreak unparalleled destruction In your enemies life, ending it of not completely, largely, ahnihallating it with elements and events they cannot fully predict and cannot defend or prepare for, just as we cannot fully predict meteor and comet impacts and still do not have truly effective contobencie or safeguards against a Meteor impact.

This is not a good time for bindings, as Meteor showers are all about movement and change. The meteors don't get stopped. They continue moving, albeit on a vastly different course and In a very New form, or they cease to exist altogether.

I'll make this a seperate post too, since this isn't a commonly discussed application of magick."

realwitchcraft,fpfk4vb,t1_fp2wja0,1588573731.0,"Well, we don't have any data to support the notion that her ex was or was not abusive, do we? We only know what the OP has -claimed- about the situation. She might actually deserve the curse, hell, she might deserve a lot more. 

No one here knows., what we do know is that break ups are often extremely emotional and that humans are less likely to report the truth when emotional, much less to recognise it.

This isn't to say her ex isn't being abusive, or that she does deserve this curse. 

What I am saying, is that no one here knows enough to justify attacking another person for offering what is actually sound advice,, though not really always practical. People don't only curse because they are abusive, sometimes they see things the wrong way or are just emotionally unstable. Making things right can help a lot, and a non-mage does not have many options. And if op is actually deserving, this would be an excellent step to resolving things.

Next, doing good deeds is in fact a great way to be protected from curses. Not only will the gods be more favorably inclined towards you, but so will the ones you help,, and their goodwill can do a lot to improve your life.

I've known many people who feed missionaries when times are tough,, and despite this making no logical sense from an atheist point of view, they somehow always have things turn around right after that.

Doing good in the world is a magick we often forget, and it's one accessible to anyone.

So, given the fact the op doesn't do magick, this was actually some of the best advice anyone has given her here.

But you know what? Even if you disagree with it, you have no reason to be an ass, because the advice certainly was not far off enough to Warrant that level of reaction.

I wonder why you did, actually. You struck me as a very reasonable person and a knowledgeable practitioner, so this seems a bit out of character."
witchcraft,fpfj8oe,t1_fpfi5fu,1588572922.0,"No, but I do believe what can be researched in the quaran And what can be found by cross-referencing different sources.

Of course, if all you have is a comment like that, you really aren't proving anything except that you don't understand logic.

What you've posted is known as a logical fallacy. ""Ad hominem"" to be exact.

This logical fallacy is where you don't offer any real evidence to support your claim, instead trying to make it seem like the one making the counter claim is somehow bad or flawed. 

If you wanted to disprove my assertion, you'd need to prove that there are absolutely zero Muslims who practice female circumcision. 

If you can do that, I'll change my position.

However, all you've done is basically call me gullible, but -and here is the thing- you haven't provided any evidence to prove that assertion, or to dis-prove my assertions.

I could say you are a rapist; I could call you a child molestor. I could call you an idiot. I could call you too easily offended. I could call you brainwashed. I could call you evil. 

I could call you a lot of things; however, it's just words unless I provide facts to support those claims. And if you can't be assed to support your own claims, you aren't worth the time or effort.

And here is the other thing, the really big thing; making claims about the kind of person someone is without any evidence other than ""they disagreed with me!"" is a great way to cause problems that no one needs to deal with.

I have no evidence to support calling you a rapist, a child molestor, brainwashed, easily offended, evil, etc... So I won't call you those things. But, if you won't offer me the same Courtesy, it does prove you don't really care about the truth, which while it means everyone should be really skeptical of anything you claim, doesn' disprove anything you say. You could be right or wrong or lying about anything.

You've proven no one should give you the benefit of the doubt, ever, but you could be right. 

That's why I'm not attacking you; it's a logical fallacy that just blinds people to the truth. I worry you probably don't care about truth if you are willing to use a logical fallacy to try and attack someone instead of offering proof. But I'm not going to attack your character.

In any case, unless you have evidence, do everyone a favor and shut up."

That creates a current of underlying and ever growing negativity, which causes more division than anything. This is a large part of why we are so divided.

Sure, there are good reasons for controlling these, but let's face it- everyone who exerts or attempts to exert power over other humans regards their reasons as good, worthy and ideal.

witchcraft,fp8pto3,t3_gbr5o7,1588399115.0,"This is a beautiful message, thank you for sharing!

I do think something important needs to be pointed out:

""All of us are inquisitive and curious people. People who look to a higher purpose, who feel a connection to the world around them and the earth beneath their feet. People who search for answers within themselves, and people who are empowered by their inner strength and beauty. 

We all practice differently,""

If everyone here was inquisitive and curious, if everyone searched for answers within themselves, we would have -far- greater diversity in the subreddit.

Also, this subreddit simultaneously encouraged and discourages individual practice.

We say you can't tell someone what stone or herb or meditation they should use (small details) but exert control regarding the Larger aspects of one's practice (no cultural appropriation, nothing too dark (or at least don't talk about it) don't Aim -too- high.)

I don't object to rebuking cultural appropriation, but it's important to note that not only is this evidence we are not all doing our own thing, but we are actively striving in many cases to impose rules on what people do and think.

Another is discouraging people from thinking magick can heal the virus, prevent it or diagnose it- and condemning them severely for trying.

I largely agree, but this is a direct imposition of how to practice on members of the subreddit, and we not only don't look for answers within, we insist that we do not, and ban any who do not demonstrate compliance. Not without good reason, but still.

Positivity is great, but not at the cost of accurately understanding the problems, which is crucial for a new beginning to properly occur."

Besides, it's nowhere near that many splinters, and Wicca, Asatru, Catholicism all have splinter groups. Hoodoo and Voodoo Also have splinter groups, and who is to say they were not started by a single guy who wanted to be king of an occult power?

Mormonism is just very easy to see the origins of because it's very recent; however, many have made similar claims and Gerald Gardner who started wicca. I understand the theory of doing rituals skyclad, but an old guy starting that and recruiting females heavily looks pretty sketch.

Unlike typical cults, however, Mormonism has endured enough to become a people. It survived the death of the one guy that started it. To say it's a cult is frankly demonstrative of a fundamental misunderstanding of it; and it's a point of fact that among indigenous people, especially in much of the equatorial regions, being a shaman held greater political power than the king/chieftain/chief/leader- if you honestly think theses religions were not to some degree started as cults, I suggest you read the golden bough.

Further, who's to say a given voodoo Sosyete is not a cult? Many are. Many Hongan seek only wealth, sex and power and -get- it. It's absurdly easy to form cults in closed systems.

It is a matter of fact that Pretty much every system of belief has been or produced Cults at some point, or had it's existence maintained by cults made in their image.

 To say Mormonism does not equate because you accuse it of being a cult is either logically invalid, or that means you need to logically hold that any cults, regardless of how much oppression the people starting them suffered, must be forced open to everyone and cannot practice racism or exclusion."

witchcraft,fp8mja6,t1_fp8l9uj,1588396345.0,"Maybe because I'm not operating from the same assumptions you are?

Racism is racism; if being opressed means you can subject others to racism in your spaces, then that should logically apply to all opressed minorities. Native Americans are minorities, and Mormons never hurt them or opressed them. Mormons literally had to settle in the shittiest part of the West after their exil. Many died from the conditions.

They were opressed by the American government, which then went in and literally took their lands by force, or would have if they had not capitulated, and this was land so terrible no one else wanted it until the Mormons cultivate it through blood, sweat and tears. 

They were demonized and still are mocked and demonized by whites and other groups- blacks, Hispanics, Asians, etc. Its not as bad, but it still occurs. Many Mormons must live in secret because they Will suffer for if not their heritage, their beliefs.

At what point is a group opressed enough that it gets to turn around and be racist towards another? 

The fact is, all races are on different levels of opression. Did you know the Irish were pretty badly opressed?  Or did you even know that because they are white?

So at what point is the opression bad enough to justify more oppression based on race?

Blood is powerful. You give a daemon your Blood, and state it has complete permission to do whatever it wants, and you will see how real they are, really fast.

The other methods are safer, but require more work and skill, and they will be very difficult to get results from if you are as close-minded as you've behaved.

Daemons tend to give you what you -ask-. They Answer the questions you -ask-.  They grant what you -request- If you prove worthy. If they like/respect you they Will often volunteer info you didn't request, but by default you'll get exactly what you ask. So be very careful what you ask for; if you get rude with a daemon or critical of them for doing as you ask, but not more, you'll lose respect at best, at worst you might find they decide to make you suffer a bit, especially because if you are this bad at asking questions you'll give them a lot of leeway to fuck you and those in your life up.

If you wanted more info, you'll get further if you A) be grateful someone took time to give you exactly what you asked for, for -free-. You May not agree with what I say,, but don't disregard that I'm still taking time to help you, -after- you were a rude, obtuse little twat on another board. Be grateful, even if you don't agree. Next, B) politely request more info,, instead of criticising someone for only giving you what you asked for. I did what you requested, I'm not obligated to read your mind- if you think anyone is obligated to do So, you are gonna have a really bad time in life. 

For your sake, I really hope you act better in real life; you are behaving like a rude, ignorant, ungreatful, entitled twat here, and that gets you pretty miserable places in life. What are you, 13? No, I've met better 13 year olds that you."
demons,fp3mung,t3_gar9xr,1588282100.0,"You have 2 main ways to begin.

First, you choose between either using the solomonic ""summoning"" method, or the Modern evocation/invocation methods.

You can find proponents of each. And you'll find people who advise, sometimes vehemently, against one or the other.

There are people who get fucked up using either method, and there are people who experience great success using either method.

The real question, is what is a daemon? If you define them as fucked up entities you should never, ever let influence you, then you'll be wanting/needing the solomonic method.

If you regard them as greater/tutelary entities/deities, (for which there is much greater evidence- it really depends on if you view daemons solely from a Judeo-Christian worldview or if you strive to study all faiths/religions/paths/cultures. Viewed from solely judeo-chri theology, they are not entities you want to Deal with, though some debate exists about that. A larger view indicates that they are benevolent/divine entities who are predominantly teachers.) then you'll want the modern approach.

Once you've done enough research and soul searching to figure that much out, you then figure out which Daemon you should/want to evoke first. Follow the steps indicated by your chosen path. Nothing says you can't try both, but you should start with the one that makes the most sense.

Also, don't assume your psychic senses are sufficiently developed to perceive them; they may not be, which requires greater work.

Or,, you can take the simple but incredibly risky approach; pick a daemon, draw their sigil, put your blood on it and give them full permission to do anything they want to you. Watch what happens.

You'd also be wise to consider approaching King Paimon first. That could be very beneficial for you.

Give at least 6 months to see what will Happen once you begin actually evoking the Daemon.

You should consider studying magick and getting a background in that, it will help greatly.

Oh, and keep an open mind. If you close your mind, you will be far less likely to experience results, unless the daemon decides its ok with breaking your mind a bit.

There is a difference between being skeptical and having a closed mind; you've evidenced that you have a closed mind more so than being skeptical.

Anyways, best of luck and enjoy the path!"

witchcraft,fozplqf,t1_fozoooe,1588194649.0,"You misunderstand; it's not me requesting.

Its advising. If you get that kind of feeling writing about an entity, it's pretty much always a warning that you really should not be saying that.

To say it anyways can lead to problems depending on how much they take exception to you doing it anyways.

You very clearly did express that op should not get the book, it doesn't help your case to try and pretend otherwise. You even shared that sensation in your stomach to reinforce that point; you just didn't seem to realize it was meant to tell you not to write your comment, rather than to tell op that buying the grimoire was a bad idea.

You don't think what you wrote warranted negativity, and That doesn't surprise me if you could so blatantly ignore a clear sign you were doing wrong. 

Nonetheless, you actually wrote one of the most negative comments here; more than the people attacking each other. I'm surprised you can't see that.

witchcraft,fozkfhy,t1_fozjo1m,1588192145.0,"If a vastly superior entity has a reputation for killing humans that summon it through a given method, it's not fear mongering to point that out. It's basic caution and common sense- Like a warning label on hair spray that it's flammable and that puncturing the can could make it explode. 

Its also not really fear mongering as its not saying that Andras is a murderous bastard, never interact with him. Its saying that he has demonstrated a distinct and very clear distaste for a certain method being used to work with him, and a distinct preference for the method you are advising against.

I've never known any practitioner who works with Andras in the modern, respectful way to have anything but positive/neutral results, which indicates that A) there is a lot of validity to the new approach, and B) something is wrong with the old one.

Now, if I -only- stated he killed people who summoned him the old way, that could be reasonably construed as fear mongering.

However, I did no such thing. I also pointed out that Andras can be worked with safely, you just need to use a different method. That's not fear mongering, it's just saying there is an evidently better way to do this.

Also, your accusation of fear mongering is a straw man argument; you just complained about someone using one on you, so please do everyone the courtesy of not using them yourself.

Actually, you'd almost be wise to modify or delete that comment; you are treading upon the domain of forces you cannot hope to comprehend or deal with. Benevolent ones, but ones a bit tired of being demonized, especially by those who literally have no understanding of them.

1) the color in no way indicates the Crystal/stones properties or wharf chakra they will help, yet this is what almost all claims on the matter are based on.

2) every stone more or less affects each person differently, with only a few exceptions.

3) combining more than 3 crystals, or combining 3crystals that don't mesh always produces chaos energy as a Rule. Useful stuff, but not helpful for chakras unless you really know what you are doing with magick.

4) a Crystal or stone may work on no chakras, or multiple ones. Selenite cleanses, so it benefits all chakras. Quartz (clear quartz) can be programmed to benefit any, but inheriantky does not help any of them.

5) stones and crystals are much weaker than humans, so they need to be amplified, either by blind belief or focused application of energy/will.
