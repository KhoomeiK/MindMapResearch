askatherapist,fj0hnq6,t3_fadqdc,1582900193.0,An honest comment and not trying to push you one way or the other: I think you may want to talk to your doctor about your concerns with medicine. You may have not found the right combination. I’ve seen the most growth and successful management of BPD with medication and face to face therapy (together). An online therapist willing to treat BDP with suicidal ideation might be hard (not absolute) to find as it’s tricky navigating suicidal ideation via internet and the therapist’s license is at stake if something happens to you. I say this as a therapist who does online therapy in the evenings and I do not take BDP clients for the liability and instability in care over the internet.

askatherapist,fc5g9sl,t3_efzzq8,1577456741.0,"When in a relationship with someone who is not well, it’s more about how to manage yourself and your own emotions than them and the relationship.

askatherapist,fbg9mfb,t3_ed2tjp,1576841398.0,"A valid concern. Your supervisor will/should help you with this. When in a therapeutic environment, a lot of actions and emotions come out that are raw and need to be processed. Depending on the client and the severity, I process the gesture made. Often clients are giving me a real view of their outer world through transference. 

However, I was consulted by a colleague to help her with a situation to where her client began pleasuring himself after hitting on her. That’s much different and was approached differently. 

While you’re working towards licensure, build a network of other professionals you can call on to consult with on cases. Document you consulted with them and put it in your consent that you consult with other therapists. When situations with clients happen, it’s helpful to get insight from other trained professionals.

ETA: i see you’re not in grad school yet. You’ll have training with this. Good luck."

How are you modeling correct interactions with him? Seeing what to do in life will go further than giving him advice. If he has a school counselor or social worker, reach out to them to see if they are running any counseling groups. Contact your pediatrician for referrals for outside help within your network. Join parenting groups online or in your community to get support for other parents going though similar situations with their children."

askatherapist,evc1xvd,t3_cj7e13,1564403800.0,"I work with children. Not only do you need a therapist who specializes in treating children, but one who can also work with a family therapist to approach family dynamics systemically. If your son has a school counselor, loop him/her into the process as well. Children rarely behave this way in isolation. The extent might be different, but the response to his sister might surface at school socially as well. The more adults in his life speaking the same common language to help address his behavior the better. 

One of the common themes I see with children who have reactions that do not match the situation is a lack of emotional regulation, lack of resiliency and poor social skills. These are two areas that the therapist would need to provide strategies for and help coach you through what to say/do at home. Another step to take while you’re seeking treatment is a safety plan at home. This is a simple plan that may involve locking up sharp objects, monitoring, and checking in on him during unstructured times at home. This plan will need your son’s collaboration. A proficient child therapist can also help you with this and one for at school (if needed). 

Hope this helped."
