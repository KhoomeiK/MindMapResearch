depression,f910azf,t3_e35bhi,1574980156.0,"You just described a regular day for me. It is almost time to go to bed. I was home all evening for a long time. I did basically nothing.

There are a ton of things I could have done but I just don't have the will to do them anymore.

I keep thinking that I have to do something to solve this current problem I have, but no solution comes to mind. I spend hours on the Internet trying to find such a solution, but I don't get anywhere. After a while, I realize the the whole evening was wasted."
depression,f90xzvd,t3_e2wpqd,1574979026.0,"Yes. I usually can't remember things that I did that made me feel good. It has happened that I experience something that makes me feel good, and only then do I remember that I've done something similar to it before."

depression,f90wzxr,t1_f8xi4kq,1574978571.0,"This happened to me a few years ago. After years of feeling depressed, I finally snapped and started crying when I said I was very depressed. From there, if we spoke about this, she would either yell at me, or interrupt me and one up me saying she was worse.

I eventually stopped talking about depression at all and went back to simply hiding it from her. Eventually I got therapy and things got better.

All that was years ago, and I never told her about therapy. And I do not talk about depression at all with her."

Repeating meetups are the best, because one would usually want to see the same people more then once."
CasualConversation,etdcqbb,t1_etd8658,1562704002.0,"For some people Social Media really is everything. I recently had guest in my home, a small group of people in their early twenties. They came to my city for the first time and literally all they did was tak pictures to post on instagram. That's it.

Nothing else was interesting. Restaurants, the history of the place, some important locations (either for social or historical locations), nothing. I only knew one of the people before and didn't even get to know the others. I could barely say a sentence before they were looking at instagram.

For many many weeks after the trip, they still posted pictures, videos, and edits, to instagram. They say they had a great time, and I'm just confused looking at this."
