Not because I didn't like him or anything, it was just exhausting thinking about having to entertain a ""guest"". I knew something was deeply wrong with the way I was feeling about his presence. It's normal to have those feelings when you have lingering issues but there was nothing I could pin point and put the blame on. I knew I just fell out of love and told him so when he came back from work, all happy to spend another night with me.

It sucked, but I basically had to have the ""it's not you. it's me"" convo. There was nothing he could've done and nothing I could do.

He begged for me to try and get those feelings back, but it was hard for me too. And I've tried to hard by myself already. I actually *wanted* to love him still.

Who effectly owns that dog? If it's not exclusively yours, you and your family should come up with a solution together, it shouldn't be just you having to care for it. Being in Australia is not a reason to ""I can't because I am on the other side of the world"". My fiancé went to pick up her dog from USA to Japan, all the way back to Portugal.

I hate my fiancé's dog with a passion - like yours, it barks at everything, pisses all over when nervous which is 1) when we get home 2) when visits show up 3) when scolded, etc.; goes after my cat and so on.

I already told my fiancé though, I would *never* want us to get rid of her baby. As much as I don't care for that dog, if she ever thought about giving it up because it's a pain in the ass, I would see her in a very different and horrible light.

Ultimately, the dog is that way because of her. Full stop. She comes up with excuses like you do, but the truth is the dog is different when it's just me. They know their limits with different people, and that dog knows damn well that the limits with me are WAY different, and acts accordingly.

wemetonline,etwkx21,t3_cdn8vw,1563275377.0,"Hey! 

I think some of the things you've said are fundamentally wrong.

1) Regarding the girl that was murdered, from what I understood they weren't neither dating, nor was their relationship online.

2) [This study from Standford](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=12249853) shows more and more couples are meeting online, the media is not just showing the bad stories, it's just a fact that gruesome stories gain more interest than love stories. Amy Schumer [met her husband](https://swipelife.tinder.com/post/10-celebrities-who-have-used-dating-apps/) on an App.

3) Finally, and this is just my opinion, the fear surrounding the internet is that it allows people to hide their true identity *if the other person is not careful enough to properly check the information given*, but the truth is that *same* very thing can happen offline. And, also regarding my experience, I find it easier to ""track"" a person online than offline. 

&#x200B;

Plus, if your own family have spoken to this person, and hell, his own family, what are exactly their concerned about? Why would bringing a random guy you bumped into in the street be, automatically, a ""safer"" bet?

&#x200B;

They're just nervous about you meeting a stranger, but I'm sure their concerns are more about the first time you guys meet up in real life rather than the whole relationship itself.

&#x200B;

Good luck for next week! Hope you guys have a blast."

I'd say you meeting some of his family members through chat only makes things worse, not more credible. They're usually pretty conservative and would not want to be involved in a web chat with a random girl they no nothing about. So, I'd say they're pretty invested on making it seem very welcoming and supportive. Either they're absolutely over the top and all around great people, or a little sketchy to say the least.

&#x200B;

Let him come to you. His location is more dangerous than yours. His age makes the meeting more dangerous to you. He's a male, you're a female. Seriously, let him come to you."

90DayFiance,esol9p2,t3_c8muut,1562169783.0,"I'm from Portugal and my fiancé is American. She is currently living here, but eventually wants to move back to the States.

Altought I would say she has a harder time here than I would have there (not knowing the language and culture), the truth is: no one considers her ""lucky""; and they see her coming here as a sacrifice in the name of love, people are understanding and are constantly making sure she feels welcomed and supported.

When watching this show, most people assume the foreigner is *lucky to be in the USA*. Period. So they don't give them the right to complain about the culture, the place, the people... anything. Because they should be thankful.

That's the part I sympathize the most with the foreigners, because a lot of people (even from outside the US) just assume the foreigner is there for this great and amazing country, and not for the spouse. 

God knows how I will react if anyone implies that I'm in a country I don't want to be in in the first place just for the sake of having the *privilege* of being there. It will incredibly difficult for me to leave everything behind and not a privilege at all.

I love my city to death, I will miss my crazy family so damn much... and the thought of being looked at suspiciously while making this huge sacrifice scares me a LOT."

AMA,esh382x,t3_c7q4kw,1561980533.0,"They're recruiting in my country for that exact same position and I actually applied. It sounded very easy and chill, altought yes - they told me right away the type of content I would be watching and filtering.

The main reason I didn't go was the type of contract and pay, but the job sounded interesting.

&#x200B;

I have some questions if you don't mind:

1. Do you always have to watch the entire video? If you see something that goes against the policies right at the first second, do you still have to sit and watch the whole thing? If yes, why?
2. What type of videos would you inaccurately flag? If everybody struggled to get past 90% of accuracy, there's probably still a ton of videos where the classification could be ambiguous. What types are these?
3. You're saying that there would be disputes about the classifications... are you telling me that you flagged videos, and then another person would double checked your decision? isn't that pretty much 2 people for the same job? 

Thanks!"

AmItheAsshole,es97k1p,t3_c6dlvw,1561729457.0,"YTA.

I'm somewhat in the same position. I bought a house with my own money, and it's in my name only. My fiancé is a foreigner and is still illegal in my country, thus I cannot legally have her in the papers. I came up with the money for the house. She will be paying me back for years, and altought the house is mine, it's really ours. 

&#x200B;

I've expressed clearly to my family that this is 50% hers, and in case I die, they give it fully to her. My law does not allow me to do this, and that's why I will leave some kind of paper expressing MY will. They keep telling me ""They'll see about that"".

&#x200B;

Altought the law is not on my side (can only give away 1/3 of my assets to people outside the natural line - sorry english is not my first language lol), I will leave my request behind and hopefully they will respect MY decision, regardless of their own thoughts about it, right or wrong, it would be my choice.

&#x200B;

Maybe your mother was an ass to leave it to him but it was still her choice, and it's my opinion you should respect it, regardless of how you feel about it.

&#x200B;

I am sorry for your loss."
