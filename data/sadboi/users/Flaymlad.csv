Also, I understand that it does get kinda complicated so I am planning to spread out giving this information throughout the story.

But if I had to make it more simple then I guess this should do, and for all intents and purposes I'm gonna use the word ""bender"" similar to ATLA since I can't really find another synonym: ""Benders have the ability to manipulate one of the four elements, the other two are manipulating plant life and possessing characteristics of animals in addition to one of the four elements, and in rare cases the powers over light and dark."" That's it basically, so I thought if I could expand it also a little bit to cover some other stuff without info dumping too much.

And I understand if it did get a little bit complicated but for me personally, I like the idea of the important parts of the story fleshed out and detailed to make sure no inconsistencies develop in the story which would otherwise detract the reader and ruin the experience."

changemyview,fn9e3bs,t3_fzr5og,1586769398.0,"Agree, and before I type anything, I hope I don't get much flack for this since this is my personal experience with gay people but gay people are some of the most toxic people to ever exist, they are the ones who promote body shaming the most and are very superficial and judgemental. 

For context:

School began to start and almost everyone of us were new to the school save for three students, soon enough I found out that three of my male classmates are gay, while the two were okay with some flaws here and there but then there's this one gay guy.

This gay guy seemed to like me and was very forward about it to say the least, he was very insistent to invite me to hang out in a milk tea shop, he was very forward about feeding me (what I mean is by hauling food to my mouth) and insisting I try his drink, at first I didn't really mind since this was how I act around my male friends before (and they were very open about being touchy so I just assumed this is normal for most guys), until one time we were walking around the mall and found the ""perfect"" opportunity to approach me (he tried to separate me from them as they told me later) and so he told me how he liked me ""more than a friend"", I rejected him since I'm not really into guys and the fact I barely know him and it just have been 3 days since school started. He was very bitter about it the following days, months until school ended.

Then a new guy came in who was 1 week late from coming back from vacation so this gay guy found another one to hit on, and tbh it's not his fault, he was attractive and like me, he also rejected him, and he was not happy about it either. The following weeks he started calling us ""homophobes"" for rejecting him.

So he moved on to the lower levels, we were 11th graders so he started hitting on every guy from the lower levels (there were a lot of ""hot"" guys at are school tbh and we started joking why x school? because of the hot guys), he was very forward about it too even buying two of them milk teas, the other one was very clearly not interested and was even trying to ignore/get away from him as much as possible and he even went as far as hitting on a 6th grader calling him cute and asking that they take pictures together. Even antagonizing the girlfriend of this one guy how she was just ""x's flea"", ""we're so better together than he is with her."" I'm actually happy that the gf wasn't a push over and reversed the cards on him.

Then this one time where me and four other people (me and the new guy from before and 3 girls) were talking during our free time, somehow our conversation steered into sex and other such topics, one topic in particular: ""spit or swallow"", he overheard that and approached one of the girl and told her to ask him about the earlier topic and he said ""I like naughty boys"" and ""if he's handsome--swallow, if not--spit"" (referencing to the new guy given he was a bit explicit, I don't know the exact word but he's a good guy tho) and so she told us about it.

In other words, of all the three gay guys in our class he was the worst, he was very very forward to the point that it's clear what he's after (a running joke is that he will pursue anyone who has a dick), he was not shy from initiating topics about sex, stalking the lower years and chatting them and taking their chats very personally (even tho everyone agrees they were just messing with him), excessive body shaming, nonstop complaining and bitching, and very passive-aggressive. It's no wonder that I caught about how nobody in the class liked him due to his personality. 

He is the very definition of ""gay is a personality."""

You could say the same for bus drivers, why do you think school field trips are not allowed anymore, probably because of frequent news of buses driving off of a cliff, and because of their size they are more likely to cause traffic in the metro compared to jeeps, taxi drivers (via airports especially) also have a habit of overcharging and on the off chance drugging someone to steal from them.

Each mode of public transport have their own advantages and disadvantages so I don't get **why do people keep singling out** **jeepneys** as if getting rid of them is a fix-all solution, you can't fix things by getting rid of things that you think is the cause w/o absolute certainty, people keep treating them as the bane of the road when other modes of public transport also have their fair share of incidents.

But if all the issue is jeepneys belch smoke etc etc, then replace the engines, raise the saloon roof, and widen the frame so the passengers aren't knee to knee, add a door at the back side or move it to the front, install an AC, instal paypal or something for the e-money, maybe change the seating arrangement like those of buses, then problem solved, instead of spending a few million in designing baby buses that are called jeepneys for nostalgia."

Philippines,fn20871,t1_fmzqffy,1586574462.0,"Well, first of all, I'm sure the people of r/Ph is sane enough to allow for a diverse political opinion, if only the politicians of our our beautiful nation aren't mostly corrupt and incompetent f\*cks, save for a select few, that continually to f\*ck up our already f\*cked up nation, then people would be less likely to downvote you.

I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you are a new user here, but your slightly triggering comments and replies might be the reason for you being downvoted. Shall I maybe perhaps copy/paste one of your previous comments just to make you remember why people don't like you?

And fyi, you are suggesting I be banned for using one of Reddit's features? It's like saying I be banned from fb for checking out my friends fb page one or two times. Tbh recently I also started seeing you at the bottom with your comments hidden and a lot of downvotes, so perhaps that's telling of who you are here on the internet. The fact that all of your comments here in r/Ph are mostly negative is also not helping. And given that the majority of the complaints here are about the gov't not doing their jobs properly, well maybe the gov't isn't stepping up to what people expect of them, instead you just defend the gov'ts lack of thought on how to handle this pandemic, it's their job to serve the people after all and people elected them to be where they are now so it's not to much to expect from the gov't.

I also read somewhere that there a black troll and white trolls, white trolls are more diplomatic(?) or at least not as vulgar as black trolls are, so perhaps you're one of those white trolls."

Philippines,fn1unnz,t1_fn0bzwn,1586570519.0,"Aside from proper subways and a more modern MRT/LRT, yes, I think everyone agrees. But to suggest to remove jeeps out of the picture is a big no, especially since they actually serve as public transport and do their job of transporting people. I think what needs to be done is to maintain jeepneys, give them new engines so they don't spew smoke and excessive noise, discipline the drivers or perhaps not f\*ck their income so they can actually afford to maintain their jeepneys in top shape. 

To suggest putting them out of service just because they look ugly is very pretentious and not look modern, then you just lack imagination and appreciation of vintage"
Philippines,fmznlmb,t1_fmz5hhj,1586525416.0,"Probably because the authentic Reddit users have accounts that are at least a year old. 

Also another red flag which is easy to see if you take your time is that all of their replies or comments are all to dissuade a topic and or promote whatever it is they are promoting. Not to mention that their account probably have negative karma. Authentic users at least somewhat care of not going that low."

I've been reading a lot around here and it seems people advise others to use the appropriate servants and ce's for your support set up for the event (if I'm making sense) to get the best out of something. I got to play a few Saber Wars quests (that Star Ears themed event) and I noticed that Fergus and any other sabers had an atk up. 

Since in the past few days I got notifs that my support servants were used 4 times. Is there anything I should do with my support set up, most of my servants are currently at lvl 40 and gathering mats is not easy but hopefully they'd still be of some use."

Philippines,fmb62jd,t1_fmazqe9,1585919294.0,"In case of possible pandemics, I think it's best to prepare for the worst instead of just dismissing it and saying that it will pass, Duterte once said that the veerus will die a natural death yet here we are now, as more testing kits become available, turns out there are more covid cases than before now that there is a massive testing. Poor implementation of laws causing dissent among peoples in Manila hence the recent protests and various complaints of people who lost their daily income and still not given relief goods. 

Besides, anyone who litters their arguments with insults usually has nothing worth wasting their time with as you rely more on shock value than presenting us with worthwhile arguments.

Also I'm pretty sure Duterte is doing his best by ordering the PNP to ""shoot to kill"" people. If a certain someone accused Leni of competing with the gov't then it either means she's doing a better job or the gov't just isn't doing their best amid this pandemic."
grandorder,fma119h,t3_frb9p8,1585881198.0,"Question about banners (if that's what they are called)

Whenever I pull up the Summon tab there are four screens from where I can do a summon, but what are their advantages and disadvantages over the other. Is there like a higher chance summoning better servants and CE's in one banner over the other, since I keep noticing with the free 10x daily summons I keep getting mediocre 1\*-2\* CE's and servants I wasn't aiming for anyways.

Also is it better to save your st. quartz's to do a 10x summon than a single summon, I've heard you have better chances of getting 3\* and above servants and CE's that way, and since I kinda blew the st. quartzes that I saved trying to roll for Emiya, Cu lancer, and Medea (If one can wish; tho I got a consolation price of a few servants I was hoping for plus Enkidu and a dozen 5\*-4\* CE's) so I don't regret it that much.

Also what do you do with your excess 1\*-2\* CE's, do you use them to enhance your better CE's, do you feed any excess servants to other servants?"

The fact na hinahalal ang mga pulitiko para mamuno,

The fact na kinukumpara mo ang simpleng tao na nanlalamang (which is maliit na istorbo lang sa isang maliit na lugar) sa isang pulitiko na ang bawat desisyon naaapektuhan ang lugar na pinamumunuan niya,

Pag-isipan mo kaya kung anong pinagkaiba ng isang simpleng tao na nagnanakaw ng \~1kphp sa isang pulitiko na halos milyon-milyon ang ninanakaw.

Ang isang small time na magnanakaw maliit na problema na pwedeng-pwede maaresto pag nahuli, pero ang isang pulitiko kahit na red handed na, kahit na nakulong na (that is, kung makukulong) may kakayahan pa rin mangialam sa labas gamit ang pera na nalikom o nanakaw nila o ng impluwensya nila.

Isa pa, hindi binabayaran ng mga mamamayan ang mga magnanakaw at hindi rin sila hinahalal, tbh, pwede mong sabihin na ang sweldo ng mga pulitiko ay galing sa bulsa ng mga mamamayan, san ba sa tingin mo nanggagaling ang pondo ng gobyerno, sa bulsa ng mga senador? Para saan sa tingin mo ang buwis?

In fact, nakakabahala na hindi mo mawari ang pinagkaiba ng ""simpleng tao"" sa isang pulitiko.

Ano bang pinagmamayabang mo, kung makapagsalita ka feeling mo may logic yung pinagsasabi mo na para bang eureka moment na magkapareho lang ang simpleng mamamayan sa isang pulitiko?

Sa madaling salita, ang stupid ng logic mo na wala namang sense, kumbaga, ikaw rin. Pa-English-English ka pa tanga ka pa rin, halata na dyan sa ungas mong tanong, paalala ko lang sayo, hindi porke nag-English ka ibig sabihin may timbang na yang pinagsasabi mo o may kwenta man lang.

Good day to you too, may iba pa kong abalahin at sa totoo lang, hindi ka importanteng pag-aksayahan ng panahon, lamang pa ang garapata ng aso ko sayo."
