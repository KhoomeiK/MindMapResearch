Or I tend to dream something and i do research on what it could mean and it happens every time. I see numbers almost everywhere that reappear over and over again. People flow to me like water and so do animals and babies. I think they see my aura? They always smile and love to be around me with only knowing me for a couple minutes. It amazing, yet a lil draining. I‚Äôm a natural healer so a lot can exhaust me. Point is, is going through an awaking kind of uncomfortable?
