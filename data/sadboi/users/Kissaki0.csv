videos,fqwew9k,t1_fqts3d5,1589701957.0,"I don't think those are the only alternatives. The problem is that reddit expects all users to curate content when that is in fact impractical in its current, simple implementation.

It is too easy to vote, and voting is too easily misinterpreted in what it is. The reddiquette is not enough to make the masses follow the premise.

I would envision a system that would provide different forms of voting so that the 'misvotes' (in the context of curation) are guided into other numbers.

Another approach is who gets to vote with the goal of limiting the general masses not using voting as curation, and curating without expertise in the topic or subreddit goals. A subreddit could also introduce a short description and agreement describing their curation policy - which of course only gets you so far. A participation requirement could also help. Like having been subbed for some time and somehow, presumably, getting to know how to curate in the context of that sub.

Topic specific subs could separate curators from other participants. Those that have expertise should be curating. Not the general masses that are interested but have limited knowledge. This is not easily implemented of course and needs some kind of selection process which is not without risks of misuse. But we already have a split between user and moderator. And the discrepancy between user and curator is one that is not handled and modeled in reddit. They are expected to be the same role but it's obvious that doesn't work especially at some point of growth.

/r/science has a very strict moderation policy. Which I think is interesting in this context. I think it's for the better of it. You can have higher confidence in what you read being meaningful and reasonable."

In the middle of your big paragraph I got a little confused. Afterwards I thought I had a grip again but by the end of it I feel like I don’t have a grasp on what you described and look for anymore; I am confused.

It looks like you wrote a bunch of stuff from the top of your head. Which is fine in and of itself. But very difficult to read, especially if you do jumps, and jump back and forth between thoughts.

More paragraphs would greatly improve readability. And structuring it in paragraphs may also aid you in putting your thoughts into categories of what you want to say and describe.

Formalities aside for now I will just answer the last questions you wrote; feel free to provide more info or ask questions or reword if you want my input on stuff.

Should you ever tell her? Yes, absolutely. But not necessarily right away and in every context, and not necessarily all at once.

Sharing troubles and emotions makes us vulnerable but allows the other to understand where we are coming from, our view point and reasoning. It depends the connection and allows them to interpret and understand things in a better way, and allows them to support us better.

If you have trouble in a relationship being open (while being validating and voicing stuff subjectively) is the best way to set a common understanding and improve it. Communication is the most important thing here.

I’m not sure I get your second question correctly. Because of course you can be happy without lying. But I feel like I lost your point here.

You can establish and work with on aspect and mask of yourself while at the same time working to improve either how you interpret this or how you handle it specifically.

Being supported and and feeling happy because of others is not a bad thing. There is value in being mindful of how much you depend on it and that it is not the only thing, but it can and should be one of them."
internetparents,fpzp88c,t3_gg2wxf,1589021539.0,"Hey, that sounds great. You had many experiences and tried many things out.

It certainly is an interesting question to think about. We are generalists and can learn and become proficient in many things. Whether and what we specialize and stay with depends on many things, and mainly the decision to do so.

Being employed has the aspect of commitment. But it often also provides some certainties that improve consistency and what we can plan for. It can also be overall monetarily productive then being your own boss. This is a trade-off.

That being said jobs can definitely be a great interaction between boss and employees as well, forming a team rather than a strict, split boss and subordinate relationship.

Switching a lot has the advantage of gaining many insights and experiences. At the same time it means you do not establish yourself in a profession as much. You will also not experience deepening proficiency in the field (if it provides it) and making use of your experience.

There is value in both, which may be a reason why you struggle with it.

A regular job that you stick with can also allow and support you to pursue general and varied exploration in other fields.

Nowadays we definitely have many things, opportunities and choices that can make it very hard to decide and stick. We have many more things to choose from than we could ever fulfill and chase.

This is when I like to remember the concept of prioritization list and dropping the bottom 80%. In many things we have so much that it is necessary to just discard much of it because we simply can not tackle it all. And keeping onto too many things will cloud our mind, will trigger us as more unsolved or wishful things.

It is important to at least keep this in mind. And when thoughts arise for me of things I would like to do I simply (try) to accept that I can not do them all."

Can you reduce how much she sees of what you do and with what?

Do you know or can you find trigger points and weaknesses she has? Can you deflect and focus on them to control her reactions?

Otherwise a single or few very simple, low effort responses is what I would go for.

Like “fuck off with your toxicity” or “you're being unfair/stupid/making me worse” or “I do not listen to yelling”.

And if responding with it once does not work just repeat it, calmly or strongly if you will, until she stops. A low effort response to her yelling is much more energy reserving than her yelling.

If you feel bad do not try to please him and use hints in hopes of him picking them up. By now it is evident he either does not take up on them because of a lack of introspection or mindfulness, or does not care. You have to raise your concerns and frustrations explicitly.

Define and draw clear borders of what hurts you and is unacceptable to you. Establish an environment and interactions that are at the very least acceptable to you. And if the other party is not willing to compromise cut those ties and interactions.

You did invest and did put in effort, but past that you do not owe him anything.

This may be frustrating and hurt because we have expectations and wishes, but sometimes we have to accept that those are not realistic and will not happen.

No matter what happens after you stand in for yourself and you well being you did the correct thing because this is about you and taking care of yourself. You have an interest in others but should not forget yourself over it. And you should not invest wasted effort.

The best thing you can do for your father is be open and upfront with him. Validate that he is important to you but clarify that his actions and your interactions are hurtful and unacceptable to you, and that you have to protect yourself.

videos,fpffwb1,t1_fpfd9og,1588570051.0,It's not a question of hope anymore. It's evident he's a victim of abuse. Ignoring that is just embracing ignorance and unfair.
videos,fpffon8,t1_fpfa2w0,1588569872.0,Presented evidence will not change. But yes before court it could be put into question whether his personal records are honest. It's not necessarily a good strategy though.

While interaction would be helpful once they calmed down to normalize right after getting them out it may be bad triggers. It may still be worth though.

It's fine that there are more women shelters than for men because women are more likely experience abuse. That doesn't mean there are enough men shelters of course, or focus and publicity on that. In fact there's even too few women shelter as well (at least where I live)."

For example Johnny Depp has multiple exes who attest to his non-abusiveness. Amber on the other hand has documented history of violence.

Questioning whether he is part of the problem must feel very frustrating and hurtful to him."
internetparents,fpcwyig,t3_gaqpda,1588514828.0,"Support can be in many forms.

Generally encouragement and enabling. Earlier teaching and routing.

Do you feel like you know what it means for friends to support you?

What kind of support do you feel like you need? Where are you missing something or are insecure?

Ultimately you will probably not get it from *your* parents *now*. So maybe the better question is what would support you now and how can you nurture this?"
internetparents,fpcwk9r,t3_gasu4j,1588514556.0,"Were you looking to just vent, or do you want some input or suggestion, or have questions?

The most critical part of working together is communication and merging work together. This is where most issues arise.

Sometimes work sucks and you just have to stick through it and make it work one way or another.

In this case raising subjective concerns and expectations earlier may have helped. But either way now may be the time to raise concerns or at least communicate frustrations with the mentor. Ask them how to handle this situation. Depending on their personality and work ethic they may make it worse, but hopefully be understanding and either provide a work-solution that is acceptable (even if it is “just get through it” - because even then it is communicated and agreed upon) or improve the situation."

internetparents,fpcvee1,t3_gb6q0m,1588513704.0,"It seems you bought into the most negative stories about work-life and focus on them selectively both in the context of work but also life in general.

Neither are you forced or locked into overall and continuously bad work situations nor is that the only aspect to life.

Many people can be happy despite a shitty job. Not because of the job of course but because of other things in life. Things that their job allows them to do.

Whether you plan a disconnected, self-sufficient life or a career path is not that much different risk-wise. Both will have risks and struggles. Neither is a path of certainty.

On a more general and philosophical note life is absurd. It has no meaning. We tend to focus on negatives and absence which makes it a negative and troublesome influence. I feel like accepting and affirming it as absurd can help. But generally there is no use in diving too deep in thought because ultimately there is nothing to find here. So if it gets you in a negative state of mind you should stop and focus on and think of something else.

I’m not sure if you are open and receptive to this but given that you are only 15 I want to say this: Drugs may be a numbing tool and effective short term, but they are only that. They can be self-medication. But they do not resolve underlying issues nor are they effective mid- and long term or without side effects. And given that your body is still developing its adult state rapidly, with big shifts in the brain and hormones, I strongly encourage you to think about the risks and consequences you unknowingly accept by doing them. If you feel like you need coping mechanisms look for other things. Try to prepare a toolbox of coping mechanisms that are less risky or damaging. Many things can be coping mechanisms. And what works can be very subjective and personal. Be it sports, talking, drawing, an ice cube, a warm meal, tactile input, focusing on work, a social interaction or whatever."
internetparents,fpcu8n6,t3_gb7qiu,1588512827.0,"The hardest part is saying anything/initiating contact. So what you say does not really matter that much.

It could be brief with a sorry and you're okay and hope she is too.

Or what I would do is write what you wrote here. Show her that you are aware of the problem, that you do care for her but that the situation just resulted in this. That it was nothing negative or dismissive towards her. That you are aware of the problem and feel guilty for it.

And maybe you can offer some way to improve this in the future. Or pose it as an open question. Either affirming to each other that it is fine to not be in constant contact, or find a different form of communication that works better."
internetparents,fpctqxc,t3_gath1e,1588512448.0,"It’s only natural you feel sad and disturbed. And the cause for it is quite obvious and immediate.

We grow up depending on and learning from our parents. But you are grown up now with your own job and even moved countries for it.

You can and should set boundaries and not accept her yelling at you.

Battling someone who is like that is for the most part futile. I don’t know your mother and am not sure if she is open and receptive to criticism. But not answering any of her concerns, blocking off any of her initiations and yelling telling her that that is unacceptable for you, that you need to work, and you can talk another time is absolutely valid and critical in your situation. You do not have to answer to anything she yells. And you do not have to answer to anything she pressures you on.

Did she move in to your apartment or did you get one together? Because if it is yours you can definitely have stronger demands, and if she does not act respectfully and does not leave when you ask her to you can call the police on her.

You need to draw clear boundaries. Because she will use and manipulate you otherwise.

You are free to write down some rules and present them to her as well. As long as she lives with her or you live together you can make requirements for yourself. You can also differentiate between must and should if necessary."
internetparents,fpct0k4,t3_gbcgoh,1588511872.0,"Communicate with them. Regularly communicating each of your viewpoints, situations and feelings allows you to gain a mutual understand and to adjust accordingly.

If you have possibly needy urges it may also help to just tell them and/or ask if they are fine with it or would rather not. Reaffirming that no is a fine answer is important as well then."
internetparents,fpcsp8b,t3_gbkc79,1588511618.0,"Write them a letter/postcard. Even just a short note.

While passing it on, or reading it, or just seeing them read it may still be a hurdle it is not nearly as big of a hurdle as doing so unpracticed in conversations. Conversations and social interactions are often less constrained and uncertain. Writing can give a safe context, time and thought to consciously formulate what you want to say. And giving it to them is a single act you can do without much thought or potentially doing something wrong. So it can be and feel easier.

Generally whenever you notice something positive or appreciate something is an opportunity to voice it as a compliment. Even after the fact if you met them or did something together closing words of appreciation or just that you enjoyed it are meaningful. And if not as closing words, a text message after the fact is just as valid.

Given how you look up to and appreciate some I think writing them an honest letter and voicing these feelings would be great for yourself, for them and your relationships. Also because it shows them another side of you. And that there is something in you you do not typically show."
internetparents,fpcs6k2,t3_gbrxut,1588511195.0,"Hm, that sucks and hurts, but there is not much you can do.

It may be better to cut contact and dissociate. For your own well being.

Because you are investing a lot but nothing is coming back. You have to invest a lot for any change or response. And even then you are in an uncertain and sorry state just like your ex is.

You can not save everyone. While your ex is certainly not some random person sometimes circumstances just make it impossible or impractical.

If she does not and can not allow you to help then there is nothing you can reasonably do. Other than mentally handle the situation for yourself."
internetparents,fpcrm40,t3_gc0uu9,1588510732.0,"You are free to point these things out. Formulating them as subjective views and feelings rather than accusations can help as well because they will not get as defensive or aggressive.

Asking for a serious talk you set up in a situation where things seem calm or at least not heated may also help. Changing a culture like that is hard, but if you can voice your views, how you see it, how you feel unseen and offer an alternative and inclusive approach and if they care for you then they may at least see the problem and maybe agree to efforts to change in one way or another.

You can just block off any screaming argument and leave that. And you can open it up again later. And you can try that as often as you feel warranted, needed, or have the patience for.

If you do so for minuscule things it may help to provide context as in that you want to open this topic again because you feel like not just this but anything just ends up in jelling and unresolved, and right now you want to discuss this in a civil manner and find a common understanding or agreement.

If you feel like the explosion into jelling about meaningless stuff is warranted you can block it off by “it really hurts me when you start yelling like this” and leave (the situation/argument)."

AFAIK ADHD shows earlier, as a kid, as well. So I’m not sure about that. But of course things may change in teen years.

You should talk to a doctor about it. They will have some more definite and practical possible reasons and be able to check for their conditions or send you to the appropriate professional.

Are you over-strained? Are you tuning out because your mind is overexerted? Does the degree to which this occurs change in correlation to something like situation or stress or as a consequence of triggers?"

This does of course feel shitty when you are left in the dark. Because uncertainty allows for negative interpretations.

Focus on the positives. You had a few good and positive dates. Obviously he was interested in you and did not see the blatant negative images you imagine about yourself now after it stopped. When these negative thoughts and feelings arise all you can do is accept them appearing but then putting them aside and making a conscious effort to reaffirm yourself that you had a positive connection and interaction, that these feelings of inferiority are not warranted here.

internetparents,fpcp601,t3_gc8x8i,1588508603.0,"When you address him and want to provide suggestions for change or voice concerns always open up with assertions of your care for him. Point out what already went well like how you appreciate and are proud of their cutting back on drinking. This prepares a setting of not attacking him personally.

Always voice what you see and feel subjectively from your point of view. Never state them as facts. This makes it clear you do not attack him as a person or deny him his view.

It also allows you to give it much more importance/significance from your subjective view because of that. (Because otherwise you would have to be very careful how strong you word it.)

Your goal is not primarily to convince them but to lead them to your conclusion. If they will do stuff *for* you that works but not as well. The best result of course would be them themselves agreeing from their point of view and coming to the conclusion themselves.

As for the sleeping, for example, it seems pretty obvious that that is detrimental to their health and productivity and energy. So you will have good arguments if you span out the greater context of nurturing multiple good influences to get in a sustainable or better overall and enabling state. If they agree with you on that (or maybe even if not) you can offer more or less strongly to support them with things. You can offer to remind them to go to bed. Or to wake them at a certain hour. Or take a walk with them early in the morning. Or other smaller things that may not be interpreted as hostile and consequently do not require explicit agreement. You can also differentiate between “I want to and it would mean a lot to me” and “I am willing to if you want to as I feel like it is a good idea to make it work”. If you think about how important it is to you, how much bother, how much effect it could have, and how much you want to put this important into your wording there is a wide span of how you can formulate it.

Of course just voicing them less thorough-thoughtful and planned is also fine and better than not voicing anything. Just keep the initial points I made in mind - affirm the other, and formulate subjectively."
