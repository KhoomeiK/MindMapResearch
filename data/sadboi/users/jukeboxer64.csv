LateStageCapitalism,fq9tl8j,t1_fq9ig7c,1589206775.0,"I'm conservative (and from Australia) but your ambulance statement is entirely false. A quick google search will show you that in many states, tax paid by the people actually covers the majority of ambulance rates and the cost, if any is  $400-$1200 + mileage.

Source :  [https://www.google.com/search?q=cost+in+america+for+ambulance&rlz=1C1GGRV\_enAU766AU766&oq=cost+in+america+for+ambulance&aqs=chrome..69i57.4508j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=cost+in+america+for+ambulance&rlz=1C1GGRV_enAU766AU766&oq=cost+in+america+for+ambulance&aqs=chrome..69i57.4508j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)  (feel free to click the first link which gave me the answer)

Also, while I used to think the 1996 gun buyback in Australia was extremely beneficial, its not! And it's shown in statistics after 1996 only reduced by 2 people every 100000! That's a 0.002% decrease in ALL gun deaths after 2 years. Moreover, since 1996 to 2015 ALL gun deaths had only reduced by 0.002% every 100000. The statistical article goes on to say "" *The government-funded buybacks in 1996 and 2003 cost $700 million. However, research shows these have had no effect in reducing the number of firearm deaths.* ""

While the stat says otherwise (0.002% decrease) it is utterly ridiculous considering the fact that the lives saved by guns (merely brandishing them to prevent attacks from criminals and other harmful sources) far outweighs the cons that guns have had.

I'm a tad confused by your healthcare professionals statement, since tax is lower in the US in comparison to Australia, it's only natural that healthcare professionals in US will be paid more. Additionally, I think it's rather flimsy to make a statement since almost all US hospitals are private, that means they're not government funded (typically meaning they are paid more than they would if they were private). Private hospitals also mean you won't be waiting 5 hours at a hospital for a sling when you break your arm (like I have... TWICE). Privatisation of our hospitals allows more jobs through the expanding of private business, faster and more high quality medical services.

In conclusion, I'm not trying to change your mind, but I just think it helps to diversify knowledge from many sources so  that you can form your own formulated opinion on these subjects :)

Best of luck to you and I hope you become as educated as possible when you vote for your next PM! :)

I mean, if you go to emigrate to another country you should uphold the standards that country has and the language would be one of them. Sure family table talk or private talk is perfectly fine, but imo speaking different languages in front of people you know won’t understand can come off as rude."

imo and ive seen others have this point. 
the left is too stuck in to changing society, trying to improve it and not themselves. rather than self improvement and striving to be the best they can be, they sit in content denial that its “societies pressures and faults” that slow them down. and the moderate right, strives to improve their weaknesses and better themselves rather than society

2. How is “voting your ass off” an excuse for losing an election? voting is your birth given right, a chance to give power to who you choose, power to who you think and if the republicans and “alt right” as you say do as they’re supposed to (voting) then I hope they shall continue to win because they’re are expressing their voice and their beliefs rather than throwing tantrums over an election they played no part in.

3. What the hell do you consider alt right? conservative and republic? Because if you do thats the funniest thing i’ve heard all day!

Conclusion, if my tone sounds rude here, pardon me, but nonetheless i think these points you’ve made are rather irrelevant to my original question in this discussion about the subreddit being more liberal. If anything its more liberal because the left is ironically less tolerant and constantly harrases those who differ in opinion, evident to the many celebrities who have lost their careers because some 400+ lb whale was offended by a knock knock joke..."
