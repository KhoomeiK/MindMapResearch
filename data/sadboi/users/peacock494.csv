If you want to lose weight find some motivation within yourself to make small changes. If you can't, maybe your body doesn't want to. You and your body deserve love, good nourishment and healthy movement. 

I feel like you should follow some fat body positive people to see how they are. Here is a great Instagram [Fuller Figure Fuller Bus](https://www.instagram.com/fullerfigurefullerbust/?hl=en)t where she often wears a corset to define her shape but also talks about fat bodies in general. See also [Bethany Rutter](https://www.instagram.com/bethany_rutter/?hl=en) and [Megan Crabbe](https://www.instagram.com/bodyposipanda/?hl=en)
