Do it! 

Putting up a mohawk is a bit of work but totally worth it. 

You don't want your hair to be clean before styling it. I usually put in a bunch of whatever holding product you will be using and then drying it in the desired shape, don't worry if it looks good yet just get close to the shape you want. Once the product is dry mess it all up, you want your hair to become workable again. You will notice it kinda holds it's shape now making it easier to work into a more refined mohawk. 

Not all mohawks are sharp tipped though, your style might be the more wider teased out type of mohawk or some liberty spikes. Google up punk mohawk and check the images for some inspiration. 

So basically once you have dirtied your hair and it's close just put in some more product and holding the hair in place use some sort of implement to dry in place. Practice makes perfect so put your awesome hawk up as much as possible!

Happy hawking!"
