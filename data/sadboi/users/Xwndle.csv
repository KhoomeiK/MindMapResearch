mobilelegends,foexeqz,t1_foblwwr,1587718177.0,It's rough. I just came back from the game and realized it happens in other game modes as well. I feel like they're using solo queue players as fodder for premade squads. I'm pretty sure premade squads are plenty enough so they can match against each other as I get them in almost every ranked match.

mobilelegends,fo5kqqy,t3_g5j6jl,1587528063.0,Why does the game match premade squads vs pub squads in ranked? So the devs think its fair to match uncoordinated solo queue players vs a  coordinated premade squad just for the sake of fast matchmaking time?
