No it was not a rebound it was a plan b and emotionally cheating while still with me so that tells me I dodged something"
relationships,fp07qa5,t1_fp06vbc,1588204051.0,"So you feel happy that my ex had a plan B lined up and emotionally cheated huh welp from you're advice I take, if someone emotionally neglects me or pushes me away in a committed relationship I should pursue someone behind their back.

I'm not a narc before my relationship I was single for 4 years being happy and I am currently making myself happy. 

You make me out to be the bad guy but I know many relationships that have chase in them it's natural"

relationships,fp016t1,t1_fp00sfc,1588200561.0,"So let's say I didn't emotionally neglect her this past year, so in 10 years we are living happy etc then you know life shit happens and I emotionally pull away. For sometime like normal people do, in that time I pull away she emotionally cheats and sets up a plan B that is justified? 

Maybe I count myself lucky before I wasted to much time with her to only be hurt years from now.

If ever I mean ever my partner went through a hard time or emotionally neglected them, I would not set a plan B I would not go behind their back and pursue someone else I would have a clean break up face to face look we aren't working. And I would take time being single"
relationships,fozzuxu,t1_fozx45n,1588199853.0,"What I am trying to say is
If that person that commits suicide does not use the gun owners gun they still will find a way for suicide 

So in my case if I did not emotionally neglect her would she still find a way to emotionally cheat and have a plan B?"
relationships,fozzb7j,t1_fozx45n,1588199565.0,"So in a way you are saying monkey branching and emotional cheating is okay, when your partner is trying to work on the relationship then you up and come and break up. Then within 3 days of breaking up you post it on Facebook new relationship, bringing this person around your family etc, I'm not stupid I know this was going on building up when we were together. 

I feel it would of been a better outcome on both sides to just break up forward without a plan B? Like I said I wasn't a bad partner just not always available and me being 20 I do have a lot going on to where I can't always make time. 
The only part I blame myself on in a way is emotional neglect but she even said herself she is not ready to open up to me again, so I continue working on it while her ship is sailing. 

I think you say stuff a little harsh if a person commits suicide with the handgun of a different owner is the suicide the gun owners fault to?
I think it's already hard enough knowing the person might have caused some of this outcome but never expected them to kill themselves, and you put the blame on them for killing themselves you are going to make the gun owner kill themselves. 

It's not just black and white"

relationships,foz565g,t1_foz46yy,1588184866.0,"Okay maybe not a full year but I'm guessing it was 8 months, it was slowly not just out of no where. We got through her brother dying and her taking her grief out on my which I pushed through for her, then slowly I just started not hanging out as much and needing more time for my personal growth. Which she knew I was 150% loyal I wasn't cheating. Maybe she as a person changed after her brother's passing which is totally okay but she did have some bad arguments with me that I pushed through and I felt I showed her I'm not gonna give up on her. So slowly I became less available and doing my own thing while we still talked daily.  Maybe I was going through a grief myself I liked her brother and I felt I lost the girl I loved. 
What I said probably seems like im going in circles.
We had our Valentine's date weekend then the Friday after we broke up, she immediately dated someone else I don't pay any attention now on media or anything. But I know her family is accepting of this person which I feel sorta betrayed by the family for just encouraging this behaviour, like I said I wasn't necessary a bad boyfriend just normal arguments occasionally and doing me
I don't know I think personally if I just started bringing someone new around my family after a longterm relationship I would get some put down"
relationships,foz40bo,t1_foz3fd4,1588184307.0,"I'll look into more help on it or something, personally it also makes me feel more secure in a longterm relationship knowing someone won't just up and leave and I been through hard times with and for her. I know I'm not completely in the wrong here, but what a shame I was actually starting to brighten up and see past it.
Personally I was still there for her and helping her sometimes with money and emotionally being there, but I sorta emotionally neglected towards the end then when I wanted her to try building this up emotionally she would disagree and I'd continue to wait"

I beat every single boss alone never with online help an played online the whole time so I got invaded a lot plus I knew about the target lock on thing since ds1 but I never used it so I beat all the ds an BB without target lock. If I didn't get lost in that area an wasn't getting lost I wouldn't need to use the help. I didn't even know until blue smelter demon that attument (I think) upgrades roll speed, so I was pretty clueless in this game an used my knowledge from other DS an me doing it how I did to beat the game all the dlcs an etc took me 134 hours around which is very long an longest dark souls game I played which was worth it.
