PublicFreakout,fjk0klv,t1_fjjpf6b,1583417251.0,"People really don’t believe this until they experience it themselves. They will say you must have been doing something to warrant those interactions. There aren’t things you could do to warrant harassment or Robert by cops...but it happens too often! Happened to my brother too but it’s impossible to prove.

There are many innocent ways you might have to interact with police and many ways for it to go wrong. My neighbors called police to our house suggesting there was domestic violence happening. I was caring for my crying infant and my husband & his friend were moving a new tv. Not sure what she heard in the middle of the night but it wasn’t us. They made me bring my infant out into the cold and separated my husband and questioned us repeatedly like they didn’t believe us. I get making sure but we were both treated like criminals. My husband is 80% deaf and because it was nighttime and they were shining flashlights at us, he couldn’t read lips. They were so angry about having to keep repeating themselves and acted like he was purposely not answering them. It honestly felt like they were trying to get him to freak out so they could just arrest him. And I could see him getting angry and was worried that would happen. I’m not sure what finally convinced them we were fine but eventually they left. We weren’t doing anything at all that night, completely sober, hanging out in our own home and still were treated like criminals. That whole “if you’re not doing anything illegal you have nothing to worry about” crap is bullshit. And you aren’t protected because you’re white or middle class. Although I bet in this same situation a minority would have been falsely arrested or worse. 

Middle class, middle aged white lady here & had a disassociative episode one night due to PTSD that ended with me being arrested for DUI (I couldn’t participate in the field sobriety test due to my mental state and left my gas cap open). When I tried to explain my condition they refused to listen and when I tried to explain I care for my severely disabled child that needs medication and gtube feeds and my husband (who is extremely hard of hearing) couldn’t understand the directions I was giving him, they refused to let me speak with him again. They were just laughing about how my family just really has it rough with all these disabilities. When they put me in a solitary cell with no windows and wouldn’t tell me how long I’d be there my mental state deteriorated so fast, I went from panic to ripping a sheet and attempting to hang myself. A couple of them came in and started cursing at me for doing this shit on their shift and jerked me up by my arms behind my back but lifted off the floor and pretty violently threw me into a chair and strapped me down. I had bruises up and down my arms and never regained feeling on my left thumb (this was July 2019) and still have extreme pain in my left shoulder. Nobody would say a word to me about anything. Still refused to believe I was anything but drunk. 

It took 7 months for the blood test to come back and prove I wasn’t drunk. It was a horrible 7 months with repeated court dates, repeated bond officer visits to where they act like you’ve already been convicted for the crime you’re on bond for, repeated drug tests where I was threatened with a violation twice because I couldn’t pee from the anxiety, money for a lawyer, money for court fees, money for the bond officer, money for the drug tests, constant feelings of worthlessness (that innocent until proven guilty nonsense is out the window, you are treated like a convict from day 1).  I had PTSD following an abduction and rape I experienced as a child. Now a lot of my therapy is actually about this whole experience. I now drive with a note from my doctor regarding my mental health status and saying if I have difficulty communicating during an interaction with police to please contact him. Every time I see one of our local cop vehicles my heart races and I feel sick to my stomach. The case was dropped after the blood test proved I was sober and I provided my medical records to the judge. But I have flashbacks all the time and will never say anything more than, “If I am under arrest, contact my lawyer & if I’m not, I am not discussing anything with you.” I don’t care if all they say is “How about this weather we’re having?” 

Police continue to make more and more people distrust them everywhere. Which increases hostile encounters, which makes police more aggressive and citizens more aggressive. They are spending more effort on feeding citizens into the justice system economy than actually helping the citizens they are sworn to protect. I think a start would be making it illegal to arrest citizens for victimless crimes. Nobody in society benefits when a young person gets arrested on a drug charge because a cop who pulled him over for not using a blinker noticed a grinder on the floorboard. That arrest actually harms all of us. And there are so many more unnecessary arrests just feeding the justice system economy and encouraging police to have aggressive and potentially dangerous interactions with citizens. Fight crime, not fun. Don’t cage the mentally ill, connect them to the help they need. Treat cooperative citizens as innocent until proven guilty and don’t try to provoke them to becoming uncooperative. One day there will be nobody left respecting police and then it will be really impossible to police our communities and protect citizens."

Also something I am sure Kody really  appreciates out of her since it’s a financial contribution. The other wives are almost completely dependent on the family focus for everything. And I don’t mean just to get by. Their self-worth is tied into their family situation 100%. Meri would clearly be much happier just moving on but then she would feel completely alone in the world. She doesn’t see herself as a whole person outside the family. Christine and Robin both seem to want to feel like they are living a special monogamous relationship with Kody & are just friends with his side bitches. Who they are in the family is literally who they are as people. Janelle is okay with her alone time and doesn’t feel competitive for more than her share. She’s completely on board with polygamy and doesn’t need to pretend something else. And she knows if it came down to it, she can take care of herself financially. She’s a big part of the budgeting and financial planning so she always knows where they stand now and in the future without ambiguity. She just isn’t living in insecurity and fear of the future constantly like the others. 

I think Janelle is a bit of an introvert and misunderstood  by outsiders but also within her own family. They don’t seem to respect her request for privacy and not making  a big, embarrassing display about things. I relate a lot to Janelle because people mistake me for being rude or uncaring and I’m not. I just find all that intense socializing to be emotionally and physically draining. She just prefers things stay chill and low-key in a world (especially their world) that is a big production. Team Janelle!"

But most every person that becomes an addict starts out a person suffering a mental health problem and self treating it. Using the criminal justice system to further traumatize people who need mental health care services hurts all of us. Just like preventive health care keeps people from developing diabetes, heart disease and cancer, preventive mental health care can prevent drug addiction. Anyone who still thinks we can just punish drug addiction away simply doesn’t understand addiction is a symptom of a mental health problem. 

And it is maddening to no end that we are still keeping naturally growing plants illegal and using the legal system to punish citizens for accessing plant medicine. For thousands upon thousands of years people used what naturally grows on the earth to treat physical, mental and spiritual ailments. Then suddenly in the last 100 years the earth became off limits to us? That is absolutely insane! 

Governments have made it illegal for citizens of Earth to access the medicine the Earth grows for them. Why aren’t more people pissed off about that!? Whether you choose to use plant medicine is your business. But how can anyone believe it is okay for a government to make naturally growing plants off limits to anyone? 

Just look at how many people have suffered from that? Look how many sick people went without treatment that could have helped them. Look how many people lost their freedom, how many children have grown up without a parent because of oppressive laws. Look how much time has been lost to research and development of effective treatments to 100s of conditions using plant medicine. 

And still, we are prosecuting people over plants and preventing people from accessing plant medicine. It is absolutely insane and I don’t know how anyone can see it any other way.

The goal should be trying to prevent people from driving under the influence. I know some shitty people who would just encourage drunk/high people to drive just so they could call them in for a reward. Maybe the reward should be about if you stop someone from driving you can be rewarded. People are recording everything else in life, they could show video proof of that. Prevention needs to be what we figure out as a society. Expecting intoxicated people to think clearly enough to just not drive doesn’t work. They are intoxicated. They aren’t thinking logically about the law or the risk of killing someone. Really wish I could think of a good preventative measure that would actually save lives. DUI charges prevent nothing."

No, it would not be the man’s fault legally that these addicts hit the rode and killed someone. But since he could have easily just taken the keys or flattened a tire, or at last resort called police or an ambulance (they needed an ambulance and probably narcan honestly) is he not morally accountable if he does nothing? 

If someone is drowning, you’re not legally required to help, but are you not morally accountable if you just watch them die instead of throwing a floatation device, calling for someone else to help or jumping in yourself? If there is something you can do to prevent someone from dying and you do nothing at all, you have some moral accountability there at minimum. 

It’s really sad that anyone can see this and not feel like bystanders owe it to society to stop them from driving when they easily can. And maybe it’s because I don’t see people that far gone often, but they probably could have been calling an ambulance or fire department to get the couple some narcan.

They were focused on the funny part of watching addicts drool on themselves for the video. They didn’t consider at all that if they managed to drive that car away they could hurt someone. 

I get most people in their right minds don’t need to be told not to endanger other people. But these people did actually need to be told."
tooktoomuch,fiy5wjj,t1_fiwjekp,1582833144.0,"Is there a law requiring bystanders to stop them? I don’t know where they are or if any state has bystander laws. I know actual servers of alcohol are supposed keep customers from getting drunk and driving. They often don’t and are rarely charged. But not sure what the law would be here. I’m interested to know for sure. Morally they should at minimum take the keys and hide them. Legally, I’m not sure what the laws are. 

Maybe that’s where some DUI laws should happen. The whole charging a drunk/under the influence driver after the fact doesn’t keep anyone safe. Once a person is inebriated they are kind of on autopilot and not really reasoning about the threat of legal action or risk of hurting others. I don’t know what laws could safely get bystanders involved in preventing someone from driving. Morally we all should do that if we can. But with some people, especially strangers, that could be dangerous or deadly.

Maybe we need an actual service to prevent intoxicated driving. If someone is intoxicated there could be a particular number to call and that person can be immediately connected with a ride. Maybe some counties have their own vehicles, maybe police fill in to actually prevent crime instead of waiting until tragedy happens after, help people avoid arrest instead of sitting across from bars waiting to punish them, maybe they route it to Lyft or Uber or a local taxi driver. Something preventative is the only way to save lives.

If we really wanted to prevent deaths we would put our tax money into something like that. Instead we have built up businesses around waiting until a driver has already driven under the influence. Make them pay for attorneys, DUI classes, MADD shame panels, Interlock, dependency counseling, drug/alcohol testing, etc. That stuff prevents nothing at all & is really a joke. People don’t learn anything they didn’t already know and it prevents nothing. It’s just money going into various dui related businesses connected to the courts. 

I know I went off topic here but the way DUI has become profitable for so many people under the guise of preventing intoxicated driving is MADDening. MADD has done very little to prevent intoxicated driving (maybe touring high schools?) but has done way too much to turn DUI punishment into a business for others."

My party acquaintances who I had seriously mistaken as friends had been partying more and more to where is became almost every night. This one night I was staying at a friend’s house because we were taking her daughter to her first day of Kindergarten the next day. But she couldn’t even take a night off for that. By the time 3am rolled around & the coke was running low my friend started really freaking out because she “needed” more coke now because she couldn’t fall asleep and miss getting her kid to school. I’m sitting there watching this train wreck happening and just looking around at all her so called friends scrambling to get her more and clearly thinking, “yeah, I think the party is over now.” I wasn’t even talking about that night. It was just clear all these people were so far gone that it had become a never ending party that was destroying each one of those people’s real lives and it wasn’t just fun anymore. A few hours later I was getting a little girl ready for her first day of Kindergarten with cokeheads in the next room and it just dawned on me that these weren’t my friends at all and I really shared nothing in common with them than the party. I had to go with my friend into the school because she was so coked out she begged me to keep her as under the radar as I could. I was basically doing all the meetings of the teachers and showing this little girl around her school while dragging her mom around who was too high to even participate. I am very sure school staff could tell she was wired and it wasn’t just a cold. The whole experience was like a bad trip in real life. Parties aren’t meant to last. 

Not sure exactly what happened after that night (that was it for me) but I kept hearing about this person overdosing and that person getting shot by a dealer and this other person in rehab and clearly the parties had ended. My friend had gone from a great nursing job, two great kids and a great apartment to losing everything. Within the year she was an unemployed felon (for fraud to get money for drugs), one of her kids went to live with his dad and her other kid went to live with her parents. If you’re sober enough at one of those parties, as the coke supply begins to run out you can really see that the “friendships” have run out too."

I had a pretty abusive childhood where you spoke about only what you were asked about & you didn’t ask questions. That kind of stuck with me into adulthood and it’s one thing I’ve been working on in therapy. I still feel so wrong and guilty if I ask someone anything about their personal life. The voice in my head tells me if they wanted me to know they would tell me so clearly they think their personal life is none of my business. My family is still like this. Nobody asks anybody about things going on in their lives unless someone offers up information first. It’s a very weird & fucked up dynamic that I didn’t even know was a problem until I got into therapy for other things. 

Anyway, I talked to the one friend I actually share personal conversations with about it so now if she has something she wants to talk about she’ll just share one thing about it as a signal to me that it’s okay to ask any questions about it that I want because she is comfortable talking about it. That has worked out great for us and really eliminates the insecurity I feel about “getting into someone’s personal business.” Because she’s helped me out with “lubricating” the conversations that way it has increased my confidence in our friendship and made me work harder to fight the insecurity I feel about asking about her personal life. Just knowing she’s okay sharing has made our friendship much stronger.



TLDR: Sometimes people straight up don’t care about your life. But sometimes they may just not know when it’s okay to ask questions about your personal life because it’s a social skill they struggle with. If it’s a person you really like and would like to deepen your friendship please don’t automatically write them off if they aren’t asking you much about what’s going on in your life. Maybe try directly telling them it’s okay to ask you about your personal business because you’d like to talk to them about it. If they still aren’t reciprocating interest in conversations then you know that friendship will always be a one way street."

When I finally did get a new doctor she was pretty surprised I was able to just stop a drug like Xanax without any withdrawals, especially at that dose, because she said most people need to taper down over time. My body just processes things in such a weird way that I skip most of the negative side effects but also lots of the feel good effects that make people become dependent. In some ways a blessing, others a curse."
kratom,fick9o9,t1_ficheld,1582349907.0,I’ll try out the red.  I don’t know that I need 30g because sometimes that dose does nothing at all (like today). For what I consider minor pain and to help me get motivated to clean my house I was taking 12-15g for awhile and it was working fine. But I don’t take it every day or even every week & after not having taken it for months I had another flare and this time that lower dose wasn’t working. 25-30g works sometimes. You’re right. It’s a weird drug. I’ll try rebooting starting at lower doses and see if I notice a difference. I never take it two days in a row no matter how bad the pain is so just might take awhile for this experiment. Thanks for the info.

While it was happening I kind of had that placebo effect going on because I’ve tried everything and they really made me believe it was going to change my life. Once it was over and I started to realize that it wasn’t going to work it was kind of devastating. I sunk deeper into depression and the PTSD/anxiety that had been under control suddenly reared its ugly head again. I’m not saying the actual TMS caused all that but having such high hope come crashing down really was painful on many levels. Also my TMS provider said they could only treat the depression with it (not the PTSD/anxiety or ADHD) so he was already expecting to see an increase in those symptoms as the depression faded. It’s hard for me to know so many people had great results from TMS, like I personally failed at it.

I was seriously considering trying ketamine treatment but if I sank more hope and money into another “proven” treatment and it didn’t help, I’d be crushed.

There are so many places to save money where healthcare is concerned and cutting the red tape around access and payment for Medicaid would be a better way to save in the long run.

drphil,fhahlm4,t3_f24xv1,1581410954.0,"Yeah, I was wondering where Robin was on this one. Usually he pans to her to talk about her charity work for abused women. Also, the “I was drunk” defense is lame from the get go. This was not a one time thing. People might get drunk, get sloppy and hit/slap/push/punch somebody. But a person who isn’t usually violent doesn’t just continue on beating a person almost to death. You can lose control on alcohol but nobody learns a new skill because they got drunk. He’s had practice beating someone! He didn’t miss a single step chasing her down, kicking her or dragging her off. I think it’s sad her kids were taken and I think they should be together away at a safe house in some type of therapy program. But men who show this level of violence typically finish the job. That means the likelihood of him tracking her down to kill her is increased if he is free. Without him being behind bars, it isn’t just her that would be at risk but the kids in her care. Dr. Phil is always saying “no “yeah, but’s” so it was weird that he was pretty much not just allowing it but also saying it himself. 

As a trauma survivor it seems like he doesn’t get that this woman has a lifetime sentence. She was definitely overcharged. This will play a roll in life functioning for the rest of her life. The prosecutor went hard on the charges because they fear this woman could be murdered if this man is not put behind bars for a long time. And they know he will plea bargain to less time or have the punishment reduced in the end. Almost nobody actually gets convicted of all charges in cases like this and almost nobody gets all of the time/punishment prosecutors request. If he is “overcharged” that’s for the judge and jury to decide, not Dr. Phil. I didn’t think Darnell was remorseful or felt sorry for anyone but himself."

loveafterlockup,fh6wpsr,t1_fh6cjdw,1581308054.0,"I’m in trauma therapy for a lot of things but one of those things is the confusion and fear I felt as a child when my mom kept telling us to watch out for anyone in my dad’s family driving by while we were outside playing because they might kidnap us for him. Then at the same time complaining that he never came to see us and never bothered calling us and had no interest in us.  Truth be told, the man had his own life and just didn’t want taking care of little kids getting in the way of that. So I have no idea why my mom made us afraid of getting kidnapped by him. Surely she knew I’d he wouldn’t even bother calling or visiting he sure as hell wasn’t going to raise us 24/7. When I did speak to him or see him he was very loving and affectionate and would buy us whatever we wanted so of course I loved my dad. So that little girl learned that people she loved and who loved her were to be feared & not trusted. And I’ve gone through life unable to feel safety and security in love. It’s fucked up & I still don’t understand why she did it.

I mean, Michael’s life is not compatible to raising those girls and I don’t believe he would ever want that. I know Sarah doesn’t want him taking the girls around his various hookups and she’s right about that. But she knows he isn’t going to try to kidnap her kids. He wants as little contact and responsibility as he can get away with while still calling himself daddy. Like she said, he’s treating her just like he treated Sarah. And he sure as hell wasn’t fighting for more time with her. 

What we all have witnessed is a child experiencing trauma in real time. That has long term implications. Sarah should have her in therapy immediately. The therapist can also help Sarah with deciding what involvement Michael should have in the girls lives and those recommendations can be used in court to should she request visitations be monitored at a centerfold supervised visitation. That would have the added bonus of Sarah not having to interact with Michael, especially putting an end to the fighting and awkwardness around the kids. If Sarah is truly only worried about Michael’s role as a father, she should be disconnecting from him in any other way and getting the courts and good therapists involved right now. Get parenting plans drawn up with lawyers so that he can’t just pop in and out whenever he wants and child support will be enforced. Don’t let her daughter’s think the way their dad treats them and all women is normal and okay unless you want that for them when they get in relationships.

Ok. Off my soapbox on this one. But one more thing. Michael telling his pretty girl that there are things she just doesn’t understand right now is pretty much gaslighting a 4 year old. She will get older. She will understand everything that happened. And that will not make Michael look better to her. Worse. Much worse. “There are things you don’t understand right now pretty girl but when you’re older you will understand that I’m a soulless monster.”"

I think it would be good for you to go ahead and see an RE. They may say come back in a couple months to a year, but probably would prefer to follow you more closely than that. The reason I suggest this is because with all 3 of my pregnancies I had to have lots of monitoring and blood testing and then required progesterone and estrogen supplementation to maintain those pregnancies from as soon as I got a positive ovulation and for a few months later. I also required very regular checks of my thyroid levels. On Clomid alone, I never got pregnant. With the hormonal supplementation while TTC, I got pregnant and maintained those pregnancies from the very first cycle.  

With one pregnancy I began heavily bleeding early in and was absolutely sure it was a miscarriage. It was early enough I didn’t even want to go to the doctor confirm it but my husband made me. Turned out my baby’s heart was beating away but I needed immediate hormonal support to avoid miscarriage. If I hadn’t been monitored so closely and medically supported, I think it would have been a very different outcome.

Her break with reality just isn’t that of a mother that went through the thought process that would allow her to purposely kill her baby. Her actions following that keep Jericho the center of her daily life so why purposely kill your baby to be free of that burden if you’re not going to let go at all? I just don’t think it was purposeful at all. 

I’ve been in that exhausted and overwhelmed place right after having a baby so I know how easy a tragic mistake can be made. We want to think that as long as we don’t do anything purposeful to hurt our child that they are safe. But the horror of it is that isn’t true. Tragic accidents happen. And yes, sometimes those errors can be our errors. 

She should have had more help. Sean should have listened when she was visibly overwhelmed and sleep deprived. But that transition while hard for him was not  like what Dorothy was experiencing with the utter exhaustion and insane hormonal shifts so he did not realize the urgency until it was too late. He failed to help or get her help but I wouldn’t say that was purposeful or put him at blame for what happened. Dorothy’s overtaxed brain/body connection just finally glitched and the timing couldn’t have been worse. Jericho had two parents and neither one purposely failed him but he died anyway. 
 
I think maybe the blame can be placed on modern living in today’s society. Where were all those people, family and friends from the baptism during those early weeks? They came for the fake religious performance and party. But nobody seemed to be offering any help to a new mom. Once upon a time people were connected enough that new mom’s had some help from loved ones when needed. Now it’s so isolated and we expect super moms to do it all and look good doing it. Dorothy was so locally famous and seemingly beloved but yet she was really alone all the time. She only performed a persona of herself and that is what people really knew of her. Kind of like people live on social media platforms and share a fake performed version of their lives for “friends” who don’t really care about who they really are as a person. 

I don’t know everything that happened in the Turner’s world leading up to the loss of Jericho but I can’t just persecute Dorothy for it or believe it was anything more than a tragic accident."

I had a Coke Zero habit until I tried to stop drinking it and now I realize I have a Coke Zero problem. Straight up addiction."

It would be nice to have just a few solid answers in the mix but I think having to decide for yourself what all the different signs mean is a purposeful nod to the overall nature of faith. 

“Everything happens for a reason” isn’t a true statement. That reason is dependent on the meaning ascribed to it and that meaning is created within the individual based on their belief systems and life experience. 

Whose viewpoint are we to understand everything from in the end? Every last detail will be defined from that person’s viewpoint. Otherwise, should no single experiencer ever be determined, all of it will remain undefined in the end.

Although not related to anything religious or faith based, I think Joker was kind of like this. You did get to see things from a jumbled perspective of a man experiencing mental illness with a few clarifying glimpses from the outside looking in. But nothing is ever truly defined leaving the viewer to make their own meaning. 

I enjoyed Lost. I enjoyed Joker. I can enjoy this whatever route they end up taking."

I don’t know how sensitive you are to it but a handful of gummy bears with sorbitol was enough to have me in the ER thinking my appendix was going to burst...until the poop explosion happened and I realized the cause of it all. Just be warned if your sensitive to sugar replacements, you wanna plan for that."

raisedbynarcissists,ffavmns,t3_ese2us,1579745534.0,"We were getting ready for Thanksgiving dinner at my house and my mom wanted to help. I asked if she could make some fresh iced tea. Instead of making the tea she decided she wanted a more important task and would get the dishes out of the China cabinet and set the table. She jerked the handle on the cabinet and tumbled the whole thing, breaking nearly everything that was inside. Now I had to stop cooking, clean up that mess and get new dishes for dinner all while ensuring Mom everything is fine and I know she was just trying to help.

Once I got back to cooking in the kitchen mom wants to help again. She clearly wasn’t going to make the iced tea so I asked if she could peel potatoes while I was icing a cake. Not long after the fire alarm starts sounding and I rush into the kitchen and see flames. Grabbed the extinguisher to put it out. Mom explains she wanted to heat up some bacon grease to add flavor to the mashed potatoes but it spilled onto the stove and then she tried cleaning it up only to catch the rag on fire which turned into a grease fire. But she was only trying to help.

I don’t really care that she claims she just wanted to help. If she just wanted to help she could have helped out in the ways I needed. Instead she ignored what I needed done so that she could do the tasks that she enjoyed for herself, making it about her and not about “helping” me at all. She made everything about that day way harder for me than it needed to be. And to top it all off she managed to criticize me for getting upset and being all anxious when all she tried to do was help. 

And that’s a good descriptor for how she has always failed to show me she loved me in any way. She would post inspirational crap on Facebook about how much she loves her kids and would do anything for them...but never said “I love you” or offered a hug. When I really needed her to step up and be there for me she was too engrossed in her own drama to show up. But god forbid I try to decline a spa trip or say no to spending my day off shopping all day, things she knows I hate, things she loves, when she just wanted to spend time with me. 

Mom might have said she wants to help with Thanksgiving dinner but what she did was ruin it.

Mom might have said she loves me (to FB strangers, never me) but what she did was use me, a living breathing human being, as a prop to meet her own needs...and inflict significant psychological and emotional damage simultaneously. 

Love isn’t some mystical feeling you can’t quite define. Love is a verb. Love is identifiable actions taken to meet another person’s need for love and support. You may not be able to prove love in a court of law but you should be able to provide evidence of it. I know my husband loves me. I know my kids love me. I am capable of receiving love. So if I don’t feel loved by someone, that failing is not mine to own. If my husband bought me flowers and gave me jewelry while simultaneously abusing me, nobody would keep telling me “but he really loves you!” So get out of here with that “she really loves you” nonsense because I have to go pick up my antidepressants and get to my 5 year anniversary with my therapist!

Don’t let anyone make you question your own ability to define your own mistreatment. You own that. Nobody gets a free pass to hurt you by using the love card. By definition that’s not love at all."
