bipolar,euvyoys,t3_chmvys,1564067369.0,"It sounds like your doing it or else you wouldn't be making an effort. I feel like a failure quite often it's debilitating but we are fucking trying and that's what should count. If you're making your doctor's visits and taking the meds literally it's just living after that...

I hope this bump in the road isn't so debilitating to you as we all make mistakes. I think it's how we handle them after the fact that helps in the long run, especially if your family continues to be there to support you regardless of what was done. And I know that can also be a slippery slope when you don't really have someone there (besides doctors) looking out for you. So I guess what I'm trying to say is I hope you do have someone in your corner cheering you on cuz by that last little paragraph you're trying and I can feel it."
