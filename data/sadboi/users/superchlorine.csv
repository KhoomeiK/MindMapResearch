day6,ewm9do7,t1_ewm87zy,1565546231.0,"Yeah! DAY6 is giving us an opportunity to explore another city! ;)

My friend and I got P1 tickets! We couldn't get seats together though, so after we get inside, we'll also be all alone. :( How about you?"
day6,ewm4p77,t1_ewlkpnk,1565543141.0,Hi fellow Torontonian! I'm in the exact same situation LOL! The one year DAY6 doesn't come to Toronto is the one year I would like to go see them... so I'm going to Boston instead.
day6,ewm44yl,t3_coqylb,1565542765.0,"It took an hour and a half to get tickets. At some point, I think Ticketmaster blacklisted my IP, because whenever I selected seats on their website or on their app on my wifi network, it gave me an error, but if I selected seats over my mobile data, it gave me the standard ""someone got this ticket before you, try again"" message. In the end, my friend and I ended up with twice the amount of tickets we needed, because better seats opened up at the very end. So... If anyone needs a P1 ticket or two, DM me!

This is my first time seeing DAY6, and my first time in Boston! So if anyone has any recs on where to stay and where to go for some sightseeing in Boston, I'd really appreciate it! :)"

- [GOT7 - Page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6Np5u_xYUA). Best song on their latest album, IMO.
- [JB (GOT7) - Rainy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuEVcRpekG8). I saw GOT7 recently on their current tour and JB stole my heart, so listening to his solo is work is in order. [Sunrise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-LW6orzzOI), another of his solo songs, is really good.
- [GFRIEND - Fever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zll7O1v63aY). So different from their prior releases, but still very good.
- [Chungha - Snapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deV_DmHKwjc). The attitude in this choreo üíØ

Got7,esaxy63,t3_c67vz7,1561772159.0,"I got the ones by EarPeace, which you can find on Amazon. They work really well! They reduce the volume overall, so they don't really muffle the quality of the sound. They have different inserts you can put in to change how much volume gets reduced, but I've only tried the inserts that were already in the earplugs by default and they have been fine for me so far at several concerts."

kpophelp,erwjtf8,t1_erwbwbc,1561345781.0,"Ooh yeah, I get that. I hate pins getting caught on stuff and falling off. You can get locking pin backs separately though, which at least keep the pins securely attached to your jacket.

Hopefully patches become more of a thing in K-pop!"
kpophelp,erw5kyr,t3_c4662g,1561333870.0,"I haven't really seen patches for K-pop groups, official or not, but pins are a big thing! Some groups sell pins at concerts, but there are some great fan artists out there who make really nice pins. Often the artists will be on Twitter instead of Etsy though, and you have to pre-order because they produce in batches. On top of that, the artist may not be based in your country, so there might be a group order manager (GOM) who will take orders within your country, and then mail the products from the artists after receiving them to you locally. This helps you save on international shipping costs. There are a lot of really great GOMs out there; just check to see if they have a good rep first before joining their order.

...That probably was not the answer you were looking for, but I hope it helps anyway lol. You could also look up some of the fan artists for Twice/fromis_9 and see if they're interested in producing badges! Good luck!"
kpop,ertf8h7,t3_c3k9sl,1561240695.0,"In the past few years, I mostly just listen to K-pop. Once in a while, I throw in 90s/00s pop (e.g. soulDecision, S Club 7), smooth jazz (e.g. Jeff Kashiwa), and easy listening (e.g. Patrizio Buanne). I also went through electronica and J-pop phases years ago, but I never went back to those afterward haha. I don't really keep up with current English-language pop releases, despite being surrounded by it. There's so much variety in the kinds of music you find in K-pop that I don't have to venture much beyond it to find something that fits my current mood."
