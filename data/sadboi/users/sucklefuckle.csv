SuicideWatch,fb2w54g,t3_eb4tae,1576458851.0,I (16 F) can relate on a certain degree. It looks like we have similar situations in regards to our parents. I also have very poor social skills due to not being able to go out. I still hold on to the fact that things will change when iâ€™m able to get away from my parents. I donâ€™t know if talking will help but my messages are always open in case. Iâ€™m rooting for you :D
StarWars,fau8me0,t3_eaip4m,1576345668.0,omg this is amazing!
SuicideWatch,fahl48o,t3_e96j49,1576088076.0,Iâ€™m a girl so I donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to have a small penis but I can tell you that it doesnâ€™t matter to everyone. I can imagine it being a little tough to live with but youâ€™ll eventually be in relationships where the person wonâ€™t care. Iâ€™m rooting for you man!

SuicideWatch,f9od7u9,t3_e679rv,1575501784.0,Iâ€™m sorry this is happening to you. I hope you can get back on your feet and find piece. Iâ€™m rooting for you.

SuicideWatch,f8r1nya,t1_f8r1fm1,1574729727.0,I donâ€™t know why I just donâ€™t have a will to live. It makes sense to me to just end it because if iâ€™m dead then I wonâ€™t know iâ€™m dead. Iâ€™m having a terrible time so Iâ€™m just gonna say goodbye. Iâ€™m planning on doing it tonight because I finally worked up the courage to do so.

SuicideWatch,f6vnbtl,t1_f6vmgz4,1573191969.0,why do you say itâ€™s not worth it?
SuicideWatch,f6vm516,t1_f6vl1kf,1573190684.0,i guess itâ€™s because thereâ€™s so much pressure of doing your best now so that you can do good later (like doing good in school)
