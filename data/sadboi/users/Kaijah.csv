Laser, when you get the money, it’s honestly life changing. Almost one year for my facial hair on laser and it’s very very thin at this point. Will continue until everything is removed of course, doing legs (almost none now), face, and pits, will continue with body after especially nips and navel. Hope this helps! I promote waxing because it grows out better, and you get to enjoy it for a longer period of time."

BipolarReddit,fh7n0cc,t3_f1c9c3,1581338659.0,"Currently on seraquel, rivotril, and valporic acid. Honestly if I wasn’t going through heart break right now I’d skip seraquel. It makes me sleep well, but I smoke weed for that for now, I like how well rested I am when I take seraquel, it’s almost impossible for me to get at least 4 hours of sleep without seraquel or smoking.

Valporic acid and rivotril has made wonders for me. My previous combo was seraquel and abilify, it honestly turned my brain to mush (I’m currently doing my masters and speak 9 different languages), I dropped from honours from almost a perfect 4.0 GPA, and I kind of mish mashed languages for a good while. Took me a while to get the right combination of meds. I wish you all the luck.

Note: day time seraquel just kills my mood for the entire day, also zero sex drive. So my doctor just moved it to just night time maintenance."
