My suggestion would be to maybe make Sundays about something else BESIDES the work week coming up? Maybe make it your known movie night? Or gaming night?

Stay inside if you want, but the SIP orders were never to eradicate the virus. It was to give hospitals time, which they have accomplished which is why some states with even liberal governors are moving towards reopening. Tons of people cant work from home and are HURTING financially, like not having food hurting. I feel like so many people on reddit just don't understand this. These people have to go back to work, especially in blue collar paycheck to paycheck jobs.

&#x200B;

We need plans to get back to work. If you're still scared and worried no one is forcing you to go to the parks, restaurants or anywhere else.  The phased reopening's are great I think. You do it in stages. And for all the belly aching going on, Florida and Georgia haven't seen any noticeable uptick in cases from their ""armageddon' scenario of GASP OPENING BEACHES!

I'd always recommend this first if you're not already in some sort of treatment. Sometimes even a simple phone call with our regular doctor can go a longggg way :)

If you're already in some sort of treatment, maybe make another call to your doctor or mental health professional about these new found fears about the virus?

Secondly, I'd reccomend reading this article. Someone posted it on here and it's very helpful.

You're getting mad at different viewpoints and fake internet points. You've made multiple comments about downvotes. I honestly don't know what you're seeking. We're all very scared it's why we're on this thread. You just seem to get mad if people aren't agreeing with your exact worries at all times. Once again, I don't think what you're seeking is on reddit or this sub reddit. I think you just want someone to listen and frankly we can't do that on here because it's a discussion forum so people will offer opinions back.

Your anxiety and fears aren't invalid nor are they wrong to fear. Getting mad at people is wrong and getting mad at people who just trying to converse with you is wrong and getting angry about downvotes is useless.  I hope you get what you're looking for. I'd like to suggest the NAMI crisis text line. Text NAMI to 741-741 to be connected to a counselor you can talk to.  It helps me when I'm feeling the walls close in.

Anxiety,fmy5xl6,t1_fmxza4n,1586478817.0,"This article is incredible. Thank you for sharing. This could be a game changer for me, honestly. Some of the stuff in there really hit home."
Anxiety,fmx08s3,t1_fmwztso,1586456152.0,"People who are claiming they can self quaratine for the rest of the year must be in incredibly lucky situations.  Financially and family wise. They have no idea how anyone else is any situation slightly or much worse than their own function.

&#x200B;

The ultra left has just as much of a lack of empathy as the very right. Reddit is just full of fucking assholes everywhere except very few places. Thankful for this sub."
Anxiety,fmwzt4e,t1_fmwy086,1586455931.0,Reddit is full of fucking assholes. Holy shit.
CoronaVirusPA,fmwwjzd,t3_fxv0wx,1586454294.0,"The hospital dashboard is very reassuring right now. If we are nearing our peak or close to it, we still have tons of hospital resources left. Even in Philly.  I haven't looked into rural areas though, unfortunately."
Anxiety,fmumj9g,t1_fmu53ca,1586394339.0,"I actually plan on donating to NAMI (the national alliance for mental illness) because i've used their crisis text line quite a bit. 

&#x200B;

It's not much about the staying home, I feel guilty for feeling...joy? You know what I mean? It's so strange."
Anxiety,fmtym22,t3_fnz5n3,1586381326.0,"Has anyone been dealing with feeling guilty for spending time doing hobbies right now? I feel like it's so wrong to enjoy myself by watching a movie, playing a game, etc.

&#x200B;

How do I get over this feeling? I know it's incredibly irrational. This is such a hard time right now for everyone and for me personally, it's making it double hard I can't turn my mind off for a videogame or movie even."
Anxiety,fmtyiun,t1_fmtwygu,1586381280.0,"I'm struggling with stepping away from the news as well. A big part of it is ""reassurance seeking"" I just want to find any little sliver of hope I can so I go seeking it and end up becoming overloaded with anxiety due to the news. I click one article in the AP news app and then I'm down a rabbit hole of anxiety and sadness.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to set a plan to only watch my state updates from the governor and follow my local reps and hospitals  to keep up with what's going on. 

We can't fix this by checking our news apps. We have to realize this. The key is to stay informed with what is going on in YOUR area (state, city, county) and you can follow official social media accounts for that or just visit your local websites."
Anxiety,fmqachk,t3_fnz5n3,1586295873.0,I'm so sick of every decision carrying so much weight. Going to the grocery store. Ordering takeout/delivery. Pressing a button on an atm. This is so exhausting.
Anxiety,fmq7v6o,t1_fmpus4a,1586294513.0,Why would your professor say that to you? He sounds like a psycho.
CoronaVirusPA,fmpigca,t1_fmpg4jv,1586281414.0,Yeah but our deaths will fairly below their numbers for the days prior. It's still shown to be the most accurate model so far either way. The CovidActNow model has been outrageously wrong it seems.
CoronaVirusPA,fmpfnve,t1_fmpdxek,1586279995.0,I believe you're reported in your hometown numbers. Not the hospital you're in. That's what the Monroe county hospital president said in his presser a week or so ago. Believe it was called st lukes or something?
CoronaVirusPA,fmpf307,t1_fmpdxlg,1586279701.0,"Yeah people will be focusing on the 78 deaths which is awful yes, but today hasn't changed my general feeling that PA just needs to keep doing what we're doing.

&#x200B;

Easter Weekend concerns me. Family gatherings (large ones outside of direct family) have shown to be a petri dish for this thing. 

&#x200B;

No Easter dinner unless it's at your own home Sunday...please PA...I beg you :("
Anxiety,fmpesbp,t1_fmpem88,1586279549.0,Well I'm sorry if I made you feel that way wasn't my intetion. I also said it's perfectly right and normal to feel everything you're feeling.
Anxiety,fmpdpst,t1_fmp5an5,1586279003.0,"You have to keep in perspective. Yes all your anger and negativity is OKAY TO FEEL. This is the worst situation the world has faced since World War 2. It's okay to FEEL EVERYTHING right now. No one alive HAS EVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THIS. The entire planet is dealing with this and there is no ""right"" way to feel personally. 

&#x200B;

However take a step back and realize your particular concerns about online art classes, not seeing friends or bf and the lockdown are so tiny compared to people losing loved ones right now.

Basically, it's okay to feel everything you're feeling it is not wrong but you also need to keep perspective.

We just have to live day by day now, hell...hour by hour. It's all we can do."
CoronaVirusPA,fmpczgd,t1_fmp7ttv,1586278638.0,"While all deaths are truly awful, death is really the most lagging indicator...even with testing backlogs. Dr. Fauci and our dear Dr. Levine have said this. People are sick for awhile with this before they pass typically. We may see some spikes these next two weeks but it doesn't mean social distancing isn't working. These are people who were already sick and are now dying or test results coming back on already dead.

&#x200B;

I hate hate hate speaking of the dead like this in such cold numbers but I felt I needed to add context a bit. 240 is also still within the ""cone of uncertainty"" in the IHME for total deaths of today. At the higher end of course but it's still within their cone."
Anxiety,fmnmaeu,t1_fmnm3b1,1586229414.0,No problem! How is the new luigis mansion btw?!
CoronaVirusPA,fmnl3pt,t1_fmmgpj6,1586228582.0,"Gotta be. I seriously doubt they would just CLOSE them because. I'm guessing hopsitals are saying ""we can handle testing right now in the way we are doing it"" and thus the resources go somewhere else."
