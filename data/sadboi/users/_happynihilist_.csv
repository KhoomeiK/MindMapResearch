MMJ,fr4y0je,t3_gl4pm7,1589899012.0,"Thank you for asking this! I came here just to ask about people's experiences with tinctures. After years of smoking herb and vaping herb and oil, my lungs can't take any more inhalation of particles. Not to mention smoking isn't very discreet, and although I'm legal, my profession keeps me from being too open. I havent found capsules where I live, but I'm thinking about trying a tincture."
MMJ,fq1vbdz,t1_fq0nny6,1589049875.0,"It usually takes around 30 minutes to an hour for me to really feel it kick in, and lasts a few hours. How long it lasts is kinda hard to tell, because I take little puffs throughout the day as opposed to sitting and having a session. I picked up some Northern Lights that's Indica, but instead of mellowing me out I now have a super-clean house. It's weird how things affect people differently. It's just about finding what works for you.

My best results have been with Mimosa, Star Dawg, and African Kwazulu. And now, oddly enough, Northern Lights.

I wonder a lot about my exhaustion being psychosomatic since I can smoke and feel so much better. I honestly think mine comes from an inability to recognize and process stress so it builds up and becomes toxic. I know it sounds new-agey, but nobody can seem to find any physical reason for me to feel like crap."

I tried seeing a Dr last year, but after 8 months of tests and referrals and specialists and more tests, all they could tell me is that it isn't arthritis. So I got my MMJ card to see if it would help. 

Sativa strains definitely help pick me up when I have these ""zaps"". I've stayed away from indica because it's more of a melty feeling, and I don't need help being couch-locked. But last trip to the dispensary I picked up an Indica strain and I really like it. I'm not as productive but it's better at stress relief and seems to be very effective with pain management."
vaporents,fpwq2bm,t1_fpwpagh,1588967891.0,"The Arizer line is on sale now for around $160, and while that's steep, I think they would be worth it. But instead of spending any more on dry herb vape, i decided to upgrade my oil cartridge pen. I don't like carts as much as herb, but being stuck inside with family, it is certainly more discreet. So I made the leap and bought a Vessel. I'm glad I did. If I'm stuck with oil vaping, it's nice to have a slick tool to make it a little more enjoyable."
vaporents,fpwkso5,t1_fpwgimm,1588965200.0,I think the next one I purchase I'm going to look for a bigger chamber. Truthfully the v5.0s Pro Mini's camber is too small for me without using the pod. The pods are just so damn convenient. Especially when you can't just turn and dump - I don't pack tightly but I still have to prod it out with something to empty the chamber. Also the pods are way more discreet for reloading.
vaporents,fpvzu1m,t1_fpv8vjt,1588954786.0,"Thanks for the tip! I ordered a white silicone and a glass mouthpiece off of a vape supply website for $10 each.

I'd rather have a pre-filled set of pods and just change them out. But they're nowhere to be found online.

I've been using a $12 EVOD Twist, which I still recommend for a bargain buy, but the Vessel is a smooth machine. The airflow, the weight, the design, the performance, hell even the LED indicators are pleasing. IMO it's like any other tool - you can get something that does the job for less money, but if you spend the money, you won't be disappointed."

I just upgraded to a Vessel. Yes, they are worth the money, as long as you catch one of their sales (and there are ALWAYS sales). I got mine for $60 and it's worth every penny. But I kinda miss my trust $12 battery sometimes - it's an EVOD Twist and I highly recommend it for a starter pen!"

We've been married 10 years, and he always has my back, but he struggles to understand my depression. He didn't think depression was a real thing until he saw me have a major breakdown 4 years ago. I usually am functional enough in life to hide my issues, but 4 years ago I had a spinout so bad I almost landed myself in the hospital. And it was then he realized there was no way it was all fake. 

Now he understands my childhood trauma has left deep scars that affect my daily life. And he's very sympathetic, but he really struggles with the fact that beyond those scars, there is no real reason some days I randomly feel so heavy and sad and worthless that I can't get out of bed. I don't want to go for a walk, no matter how better it will make me feel. And yes, I need to eat everything in the pantry in one day.

I said for years I wasn't affected by how I grew up - I'm OK, have a good career, mentally stable(ish), happy marriage, etc. Now I think the only reason I'm as OK as I am is because I never realized how bad it was.

There isn't anything else at this company that I'm qualified to do without taking a significant pay cut,and I knew that, but I needed to buy mysf as much time as possible to line up something else. I lucked out and 5 days after telling my boss I wanted out, I received a very luctative offer from another company for a less stressful position.

Ive never ever quit a job without something else lined up, so it was pretty terrifying. But it all seemed to work out for the best. This Friday is my last day, and I have begun training my replacement. Next week I begin a new adventure!"

Now that you mention it, I do remember the pain. It's almost like how people describe fibromyalgia. Like every nerve in your body hurts. I also had the brain fog. And probably memory loss, but my memory is bad anyway so I might not have noticed. It's hard to notice everything when you're in pain like that. After I told my Dr I couldn't do it anymore and if I was going to quit it needed to be in a hospital of some kind (I was ready to check myself into the psych ward), he put me back on them, said my brain receptors just weren't going to work right without medication, so I would probably be on it the rest of my life and I should count myself fortunate that I don't have any major side effects from taking it.

I haven't heard of Trintellix tho. I just wish I could go back to when Cymbalta worked. It was the right one for me. Worked so well I was convinced I didn't need it! ðŸ˜†
antidepressants,fhd8vb7,t1_fhcznd7,1581479917.0,"I have no idea what I want to try next. I've had years of trying something, hating the side effects, quitting it until I realized I needed to be on something, trying something new, and repeating the cycle. Cymbalta is the first I've tried that helped (initially) with almost no side effects. So of course it's the one I develop tolerance to. ðŸ™„"
antidepressants,fhcxhcb,t1_fhcujus,1581472911.0,"I don't go to one, either. My PCP has always handled my AD meds. But my Cymbalta isnt working so I'm thinking I should see a psychiatrist to help with the transition to something new, because the withdrawals almost killed me last time."
antidepressants,fhc7msr,t1_fhc70i1,1581457832.0,"Thanks! Maybe a problem was that I wasn't transitioning to anything else - I was trying to quit antidepressants because I had convinced myself I didn't need them anymore (haha).

How is/was Zoloft compared to Cymbalta?"

I wasn't sad, I wasn't happy, I was just a shell. It was OK for those 3 months because I'd just gone through a nervous breakdown, but eventually I had my shrink take me off so I could try to assimilate myself back into real life. I had no lasting side effects once it was out of my system."

CongratsLikeImFive,fh0hfw2,t1_fgxo74l,1581203929.0,"Kinda what OP said. I was upfront about what I needed - required - to work for them. I make more than my spouse, and I carry the insurance for me and my stepdaughter, so I couldn't - wouldn't - take a pay cut or go without insurance for 3 months. I also interview well, so that helps. My favorite line is ""I know I'm asking for a lot in terms of salary, but I'm also confident I have the skills to back it up."" I don't have a degree, and almost every job at my pay grade requires one (even though I'm just administrative support), so I didn't think I was going to get my ask. But they called less than 24 hours after my interview and offered me 1500 more than my current salary plus bonuses and they're kinda flubbing the paperwork to get me benefits sooner while I'm working out my notice at my current employer.

Go in with confidence. Be pleasant and make eye contact, ask questions. I was interviewed by 3 people and at the end of their questioning I asked them why they were interviewing me and how my role at the company would relate to what they do. They looked shocked in a good way. But be upfront about what you need. The right company will make it happen for you.

Honestly, I wasn't going to accept this position. I knew they were going to make me an offer - one guy told me my interview had been ""a really awesome experience"". But it's corporate and I have 2 other interviews scheduled with non-profit orgs that I really wanted to work for. But they bent over backwards to meet and exceed my requests for me and my family. To me its more important who you work for than what company you work for."
CongratsLikeImFive,fgulpsp,t3_f0jthe,1581123944.0,"Every damn day I can't believe I've made it to 43. I began contemplating suicide when I was 12. I was pretty sure I'd never make it past my 20s. All I can say is it really does get easier. I mean, shit still sucks sometimes, and I still contemplate suicide, but it's nothing like it was when I was younger. And hell, I've made it this far, might as well see this ride through...
Keep going. If you're feeling suicidal, I know it sounds dumb, but take a nap. When you wake up, remember that you just made it through 2 more hours (or however long your nap was). Somehow that dumb trick has saved me numerous times..."
