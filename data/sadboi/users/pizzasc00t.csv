selfharm,fpq3u9w,t3_gejcvi,1588814621.0,"Ugh stuff like this happens to me all the time. At first it’s so hard to deal with. I really hope as time goes on you’ll get more comfortable bc let me tell you, it’s your body and your life and you deserve to wear whatever the fuck you’re comfortable in. People that have anything to say about that are stupid. We can’t be afraid to put them in they’re place. Tell em to mind their own business. It’s hard. I hate confrontation personally. But we can’t let other people take control of us like that. It really will get easier. But for now, take your time. Sending you love."
SelfHarmScars,fpq30i5,t3_genc6r,1588814153.0,It won’t go away necessarily but my scars used to look a lot like yours and now they’re barely visible! It’s just going to take time. Sending you love
SelfHarmScars,fpo1urq,t3_geh54f,1588776860.0,"I did all of my arms around 14 and continued to cut only my arms for years. When they were fresh, I mean they were really prominent. I’m 24 now, I have a few tattoos and they’re not nearly as noticeable. It will be difficult for now, but in time they’ll fade. Stay strong! You’re not a freak. You’re a person who’s going through something and this is how you cope. Some people won’t understand but honestly fuck those people, they don’t deserve to understand. Much love ❤️"

USPS,fow0mcm,t1_fow0a9m,1588110836.0,It’s normal to have a disclaimer like that on an official usps email?
USPS,fow07xh,t1_fovzvrj,1588110629.0,It’s literally just the persons name @usps.gov just like that in lower case. The original topic was about how I was not getting mail for a week and it confused me so I told her what the real problem was. I feel like such an idiot. But can she do anything with the tracking and recipient’s address?
USPS,fovzkvu,t1_fovz4t2,1588110306.0,"I’m not so sure, there was a disclaimer(yes I know I’m stupid) that reads “caution:this email originated from outside usps. Stop and consider before clicking links and attachments” is that normal?"

Just to kind of add on I have colored hair, piercings and tattoos and it makes me so sad when older women tell me that they love my style but are too old to pull it off :( it’s simply not true!

Depop,fn6fdgn,t1_fn3scjl,1586697756.0,I’ve filed requests and nothing happens :/ people just lying to me. The last scan was literally in a distribution center and the other was in the fucking post office. I know the packages are in there.
Depop,fn6f93i,t1_fn3cxmu,1586697659.0,I actually worked for UPS too and my partner has been a UPS employee for a long time so I know how the system works. I was just wondering if anyone uses anything different. The post office has literally been refusing to look for my shit tho. The last scan for one of my packages was in the fucking post office and she lied to my face and said it isn’t there. I appreciate your input though and I thank you for clearing up that even the discount sucks(bc I could get that too). So thanks!

Depop,fmqvhi7,t1_fmqnofw,1586307948.0,Yeah I think it was from the actual bank account before because I’m not getting notifications for that. But it’s really inconsistent which is weird. Sorry that this don’t make a whole lot of sense here but thank you for your reply
Depop,fmqm862,t1_fmqb46d,1586302386.0,I guess I’m questioning why my PayPal receipt says $14.26 when that’s not what I’m getting. They should show the final number being transferred not the number before fees.
Depop,fmql6jw,t1_fmqb46d,1586301789.0,Before I was guessing depop is taking their fee out anyways so it like cancels out. I’m sorry I really don’t think I was clear but idk any other way to explain this
Depop,fmql2wr,t1_fmqb46d,1586301729.0,Yes! I totally understand this. However it’s just weird to me because before (for example) I would get the $14.26 transferred. I know I don’t make money off shipping. Like I said this is hard to explain. I’ve audited my books like you wouldn’t believe. I have bank statements saying I got the full amount.
Ebay,fmmzrdl,t3_fw41ya,1586215228.0,I did have a package get lost recently :/ I’m trying my best to work with the customer on it but yeah it went to the first distribution center and never made it out.

Depop,fmhmzjg,t1_fmhlafz,1586086826.0,I really don’t want to sound rude but has anyone bought something after you message them? Like what would you say your success rate is with that?
relationship_advice,fmgmkj6,t1_fmgk97w,1586052364.0,Ok thank you very much for your input I really appreciate it. Me and my bf are really close but I just can’t help but be scared. But it’s really reassuring to hear about other couples with a similar experience!
relationship_advice,fmgjy75,t1_fmgiart,1586050704.0,Did she tell you specifically what pleases her? Were you offended if she told you what she needed?
relationship_advice,fmgi21v,t1_fmghvut,1586049538.0,Oooh omg thank you for this
relationship_advice,fmgi0xv,t1_fmgglfr,1586049517.0,I hope so. I really don’t want to hurt his feelings. I know I would feel bad if I were told I was bad at sex :(
relationship_advice,fmghxxp,t1_fmggl8j,1586049462.0,"I’ve shown him before and he’ll pay attention then he won’t do it :( I’ve thought about videos and stuff though. I really appreciate your advice, thank you"
Depop,fmfox6x,t3_fuxfhv,1586031809.0,There really needs to be a better system with tagging. I sell a lot of gothy stuff and the goth tags are FILLED with completely unrelated bullshit. Really sucks for smaller shops like me
CBD,fm8b8ze,t3_ftm41i,1585846219.0,"For me personally it does help but for only a span of like, 10-20 minutes. For example, I smoke hemp flower right before I drive bc I get terrible panic attacks while driving, and its enough to calm me down before the panic hits and then I’m already in that headspace so I just stay more calm. I really wish the first feeling you get would last longer because I would definitely stay more mellow. I can see how people can smoke all day every day but I really try to use it before putting myself in an environment when I know I’ll panic. I really don’t want to take pills and I do feel like this is good for me but like I said, just wish the effects would last longer. Hope this helps and good luck to you!"
relationship_advice,fm84zps,t3_ftmjk6,1585842914.0,"Honestly man, I really don’t think you over reacted at all. That isn’t a joke to take someone’s meds like that. I’m really sorry she put you through that, it’s extremely cruel. I really can’t get into her headspace as to why she would do that other than she’s just not a mature person. That definitely was going way too far. Hopefully you guys can have a serious conversation and she can understand that it’s not about you ‘not taking a joke’. It’s about her taking away vital medication and having you look for it for a whole fucking hour. I just can’t even imagine. 
Best of luck to you and sorting your situation"
TrueOffMyChest,fm6x0vb,t3_ft9fi6,1585805780.0,"Sending you lots of love, my friend. I really appreciate you sharing this, despite what people may say. The gay community isn’t perfect and it needs to be addressed. I have never once been to pride bc I know I would flip out if I saw people doing a BDSM scene because you’re right, that’s not what pride is for. Certain things within our community just really need to be talked about so thank you for opening a conversation even if it’s hard to have."
unpopularopinion,fm6wghe,t3_ftbv6g,1585805270.0,"I’m with you. Thanks for sharing. Weed causes me terrible anxiety. I smoke CBD now and it helps me but that’s a whole other thing. Someone close to me has Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. It happens after years of heavy use, at least in his case. Uncontrollable vomiting. Can only be relieved by hot showers. Super strange but it was so awful just seeing someone go through that. And he still can’t kick the habit. I try to warn all the heavy users I can about this because it’s real and it’s not good. Again thanks for sharing and best of luck to you. I hope you find good coping methods"
CBD,fm6e20x,t1_fm649v8,1585792009.0,Not a bad idea. I’m really interested to see how that plays out. You should keep us updated! :)

Yeah I mean like I said, I only smoke a bowl a day. Sounds like you smoke a little more than me so that may have something to do with it"

CBD,fm5f6lp,t1_fm5efhf,1585771801.0,It’s in the pharmaceutical field. It frustrates me because testing positive for THC or any other drug doesn’t mean I would steal pills lol. And if I did test positive I wonder if I would have been able to show lab results for the particular strain I take and explain that it’s legal? Probably not but that’s what makes the testing so stupid
CBD,fm5e201,t1_fm56m3i,1585771190.0,I agree with you. Tbh I think all drug testing is kind of stupid unless you’re operating a vehicle. It just creates a whole cycle. How are people going to get clean and get off the streets if they can’t get a job? In the case of marijuana and CBD it’s stupid because CBD is legal in the US and marijuana is legal in a lot of states. I read a policy for this company that says you can’t even smoke marijuana if you have a prescription. Ridiculous.
CBD,fm56de0,t1_fm55c75,1585767155.0,You’re correct. I’m not sure exactly what kind of things they would be looking for on the drug test but I still think it’s good info to have since I have not seen a lot of information about people passing/failing drug tests while ingesting CBD.
CBD,fm4vsme,t1_fm4thyj,1585761734.0,"Yeah basically. It’s a small amount. I think you’re right, it’s when you smoke all day every day there may be a problem."

AnxietyDepression,fkni8b8,t1_fknhr2y,1584366381.0,"Right now I’m out of a job but I’ve worked in retail for years in the us. I’ve self disclosed on every application and have got multiple interviews. With the pandemic going on, it’s been difficult to confirm anything because no one is at work. The thing is, your immediate boss won’t know if you disclose. At least they shouldn’t. It’s more of a corporate thing. So say you have a panic attack at work and your boss has something to say about it, tell them you disclosed on your application and corporate knows about it. Your immediate management isn’t supposed to know. Like you said, there is still discrimination and ways around it, but if you take it up with a lawyer, the employer will always be wrong."
AnxietyDepression,fknhnr2,t1_fknhe12,1584365988.0,"Um, me? Lol I’ve been hired/interviewed multiple times after self disclosing. I get discriminated against more for being female, honestly. But if it works for you, then that’s fine! Just wanted to offer my experience."
AnxietyDepression,fknh3dj,t3_fjjzpe,1584365603.0,"I personally always self disclose, in case something should go wrong at work, then they can’t say they didn’t know I have a panic disorder. I’m still able to work, I just may have an anxiety attack and if you self disclose employers shouldn’t be able to fire you over that. If they do, you can take it up with a lawyer. It’s always good to do research on what the specific laws are for that but they basically can’t discriminate against you."
