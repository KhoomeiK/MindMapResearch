Anxiety,f304gdj,t1_f2zh95e,1570546187.0,"*potential triggers*
Mine was very productive. At one point i had a really hard time leaving the house and I felt like all I wanted to do was get back home as soon as possible. I’d have panic attacks on my drive into work which is only 30min. I couldn’t communicate with my wife very well anymore. On top of the anxiety I had depression issues. Therapy helped me get to a point where I could function again. Once I added medication (lexipro) I can almost do everything I used to. I still get overwhealmed with paying bills or doing the mail and sometimes I’ll have panic attacks while driving but all in all it has been a massive improvement. Unfortunately when I left the military I lost access to my therapist and I am trying to get back with a therapist so I can continue to work on things. You should realize that it can be a long process. I was in therapy for over a year to get where I am now. Definitely worth the effort though because I have a life again."
Anxiety,f2yxscm,t3_detn9m,1570501020.0,One thing that helps me is to try and focus on the thoughts that race through my head and type them out on my phone. Eventually the thoughts slow down to match my typing speed and I can regain some control that way. Hope this helps!
Anxiety,f2xxq8z,t1_f2xwpu0,1570483764.0,Easy enough! If they ask why you came back in just tell them it was bugging you and if someone did to you you’d appreciate them fixing for you. When in doubt people don’t usually think you’re weird for trying to follow the golden rule (which is really all you’re doing here anyway!).
Anxiety,f2xwaxh,t3_dep4yl,1570483284.0,I take Lexipro every day and I’ve had a great experience with it. I don’t get zombied out at all. It takes away a lot of the physical symptoms of panic attacks and allows me to focus on my thought patterns easier. The anxiety still exists but I can tackle it a lot easier if I’m not stuggling for breath with a heart rate well over 100 bpm. No ptsd but my anxiety comes from time in the US Navy (noncombat role and enlisted) so if you wanna talk to someone with a military background I’m here.
Anxiety,f2xv9zy,t3_depdsn,1570482944.0,"If you can get into the office early tomorrow to fix the mistake that would be my suggestion. If you can’t get in early then do it first thing when you get there. Another option is you could just appogize to your coworker and if its a small inconvenience like you said then it shouldn’t be a big deal to her. Idk how long your commute is or any of that so if you’re five minutes from work and people are still there then I dont think it would be an over reaction to go back. No matter how you decide to correct the mistake, don’t let your day be ruined by it. When I have this issue I come up with a solution and everytime my anxiety throws the mistake in my face I remind myself of the plan to fix it. That generally allows me to break free of the spiral. Hope this helps!"
Anxiety,f2xtjw5,t3_dep7d3,1570482356.0,Driving can be scary even for people that have been doing it a long time. It might help to practice thinking through how everything should work when your alone and not in the car. That way when you go to drive if you start to get nervous you can just remind yourself you practiced and take a breath. None of what you said sounds like you’re crazy bananas to me. Hope this helps!
anxietysupporters,f2xrpf9,t1_f2xo4jx,1570481747.0,"For sure. The Australian government also has some great work sheets for free online. They can be found here: https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Anxiety 
I found that the more specific links are really quite helpful as well. Those are also nice because they are already organized into a step by step process. Just move from one to the next as she gets comfortable with the current exercise. I hope she is able to work through this, its hard enough to deal with as an adult and I can’t imagine what it must be like for a kiddo."
Anxiety,f2whbc2,t3_deeeub,1570465797.0,"I hope you’re doing better. Ever since I had “the big one” (silly way to remember it but it makes me laugh sometimes when I need it most) I can remind myself that the attack I’m currently going through isn’t as bad as that one and if I survived “the big one” then I’ll survive them all. On the flip side, if I feel like a panic attack is getting close to “the big one” in severity I know to get outside help somehow."
Anxiety,f2wbx3p,t3_dek2lo,1570463886.0,Therapy is supposed to be a safe place to push your limits and work through things so crying is just part of the process! I know I’ve definitely been there myself.
anxietysupporters,f2w5xwi,t3_cey8hi,1570461719.0,I’m not a doctor or a therapist but I’ve been in treatment for anxiety the last year and a half. I’m in my 20’s so this may be different for someone so young but no one else answered so I’ll give it a go. When i went through therapy we started with just learning to recognize my triggers because everything seemed like a trigger at first and eventually i was able to recognize what was really bothering me. We got there by using a couple different exercise sheets. The best one for me was from www.getselfhelp.co.uk called thought record sheet 7 column. It helps you decide what is affecting you the most of all your triggers which helped me isolate which were triggers and which were complications from other triggers. Once i got that down then it’s about slowly building up how much information you take in. I hope this helps! I would definitely suggest looking into therapy though since there are a lot of options out there. If she’s that young her school may even have a licensed councelor she can see.

FoodPorn,f2tbigq,t3_de8abd,1570392844.0,Looks good to me! I haven’t done any tofu dishes yet because my wife isn’t a huge fan but I’d like to give it a go soon anyway.
FoodPorn,f2smvp3,t3_de6ojo,1570385034.0,That looks incredible! Im excited to see the recipe and give it a go. Thanks for sharing.

food,f2s07ch,t3_de50ov,1570378164.0,I’ve always wanted to try making something like this but I’m scared of it.
