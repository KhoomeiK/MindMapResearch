socialwork,fqghjfh,t3_girs02,1589346437.0,"Personally, I would run not walk from any potential therapist incentivizing referrals in any way. I believe you would be tainting the client-therapist relationship by even suggesting that a client refer people because clients often want to please their therapists and this could really be an abuse of what should be a therapeutic relationship/alliance. Like you, I don't recall reading about this in the NASW Code of Ethics or even on my law and ethics exam but it feels gross and I go with my gut.

Edit: I think it is comparable to exchanges that are explicity forbidden like having a client who is a painter, paint for you in exchange for sessions. It is my understanding that this should be avoided as much as possible. The only exchange we want to have with clients is therapy for monetary compensation that is agreed upon in advance."

I've taken just about every anitpsychotic and was desperate for something to work. Just be prepared for it to make you sedated. I was on 20 mg a night but in a really bad episode. I also have a good friend who has taken 20 mg a night for years now and he loves it. So, I don't think you need to fear it. Just plan on going to bed within an hour or two of taking it.

It sounds like you have diagnosed yourself with manic episodes but you really need a psychiatrist to do that. It's great if you're tracking your moods and symptoms to self-advocate but if you actually have manic episodes and you accurately described them to the psychiatrist and she found you to be a reliable reporter and still prescribed Prozac as monotherapy with no med check for four weeks, you should consider finding a new doctor."

Unless you are prepared to care for dog for up to 20 years and are able to provide the care and support they need throughout that time, I think it is best not to take them in to begin with. I volunteered in animal rescue for years and still do when I can and it is very difficult for the animals and the volunteers when people return an animal for any reason. It's a huge commitment and one that should not be taken lightly.

I saw a piece a few nights ago on the news about Sweden and their officials seem convinced that their death rate will be no higher than anyone else's in a year's time. In case, everyone isn't familiar, their approach has pretty much been to just let it wash over the population and warn the vulnerable to stay in. My issue is that if they reopen and expect even those at high risk to go into work, it will be bloodbath. Americans are not the healthiest people and even a lot of young people are obese or have health issues. We can't underestimate the percentage of our population that is at risk and they actually do not seem to know enough about the virus to even know who is at the most risk."

I do have a friend who has done ECT twice and thinks it helped a little but came with a lot of memory loss. She is as quick as ever, though! She too was in a place of just wanting to die every day. 

It sounds like you may want to discuss this further with your doctor. I know it can be used to treat mania as well as depression and mixed states and even though it is still considered the gold standard in treatment, I don't think most doctors recommend it for someone unless it's a last resort. If you feel like you have other options, maybe you should try those first. Also, maybe watch ""The Great Depresh"". He's MDD not BD but swears that ECT really helped him.

Unfortunately, our profession is rife with people who haven't done their own work and therefore don't really value themselves.

It is also widely known that when these people first start to feel better can be the most dangerous time because it is when they may be most likely to have the wherewithall to act on the SI they'd beeing thinking about. I'm sorry you have been having a rough time and hope you are able to get some relief!"
socialwork,fnu9fd0,t1_fntm33k,1587257277.0,"Excellent points!! As an LCSW and person with Bipolar, I say, ""I'm Bipolar"" because that's how I experience it. That fucking illness consumes me at times. Perhaps unlike some with Autsim, I am in no way proud of it and most definitely consider it a horrible illness. However, at work when I'm interacting with someone I am not really familiar with, I always use person first language but like the OP, when I am talking to friends it is simply too convoluted to say ""a student with an intellectual disabilty"". 

I'm glad to see an open and honest discussion of this topic because I don't think we need to be policing others. I have a freind who says, ""Language creates our world"" and I love him for it and his insistance that he himself always uses the most correct language (of the day, I would note as it is always changing) but it is not always economical lingustically. I work in a school setting and luckily none of my colleagues think twice about saying things like, ""That family is homeless"" or ""Susy is totally ADHD"". I know we're all coming from a good place and that's what matters most. As I heard the other day, ""Worry more about offending than being offended""."
bipolar,fnt8211,t1_fnt5rmk,1587236409.0,"I get what you're saying. Personally, I would never use the term ""mood swings"" to describe my experience. Swing makes it sound like some smooth motion. My mood shifts are more like a broken gear shift and it can be really painful but I'm also prone to mixed episodes. Everyone has their own unique experience with the illness and how it impacts us. I think it is more important that we focus on treatment for symptoms that interefere with functioning than our label."
bipolar,fnrie7f,t3_g3ide2,1587189899.0,"This is how you know:

bipolar,fnr2x5u,t3_g3fi8b,1587178010.0,"Wow!! This is pathological. You can also stop calling the guy ""one of our friends"" because no freind would do that.

I'm sorry."

I'd strongly suggest that you do that. I'd also suggest avoiding Aderall and coke. If you want to message me the name of your state, I can try to see if you have similar services for free. This is an emergency and don't under-estimate it."

bipolar,fnbykp0,t3_g0uyea,1586824913.0,"I wouldn't worry about it. Even if you signed a ROI, it doesn't mean your therapist felt it was necessary to act on it and speak to your psychiatrist. Your therapist(s) is only providing talk therapy and most therapists will give you the least severe dx they can given signs and symptoms you present with. I doubt your tx plan would be changed based on the dx."
BipolarReddit,fnbdi9p,t3_g0rnvq,1586813606.0,"I can't answer your question but Bipolar is considered ""highly heritable"" with genetics explaining 60-85% of risk ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3637882/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3637882/)). Like other heritable traits, many genes come into play. As a male, your genes would make up half of the genes of any child you father."

Makes perfect sense. I'm going to ask my doctor about some to have as needed."
bipolar,fn862mg,t1_fn83ijh,1586734682.0,"Wow. Thank you so much for sharing your personal experience and this information. During my last episode, I felt like my heart was revving like a driver pushing hard on the gas peddle but the wheels were just spinning and the engine making noise but not going anywhere.

So, do you take the betblockers when you are not experiencing mania as well?"
bipolar2,fn81c07,t3_g03ywd,1586731846.0,Who dismissed BD because you didn't have a manic response to Adderall? Maybe what you're experiencing is a response to the Adderall or maybe it is a dysphoric mania or mixed state. Definitely a question to ask you doctor about. You can also have MDD with mixed features.
bipolar2,fn80yyb,t3_g05l3u,1586731635.0,"Whenever you feel like it. Bipolar is not contagious. So, I don't think there is any moral obligation to disclose it to someone at any particular time. I was with a guy for two years and never told him. We even lived together. I just didn't think he was someone who would understand and my meds at the time were keeping me stable. In other relationships, I've disclosed after a couple of months. It's totally up to you and I prefer to err on the side of caution as I've had it thrown in my face a couple of times by a friend and an ex-boyfriend."
TherapeuticKetamine,fn800k3,t3_g052cm,1586731074.0,"Agree with other posters here. The only thing I've heard that might interfere with it is a benzo.

bipolar2,fn7gvvo,t1_fn7bt9i,1586720084.0,"I didn't feel attacked at all. I totally get where you are coming from as a patient as I've been through all kinds of BS with various psychiatrists--and was dx'd with ADHD and MDD at one point myself--and even worse shit from psychotherapists who don't know what they're talking about. Any sharpness you are reading in my posts is coming from a place of frustration over those who are supposed to be hleping us not really knowing their shit. How the hell are they going to help us when they don't understand us or our illness. They can end up doing more harm than good. When I was young and first saw a psychiatrist she put me on a shit ton of Prozac and Ativan and when I reported that I could only sleep after drinking alcohol, she told me I was an alcoholic and that if I didn't attend two AA meetings before my next appointment, she was going to take away all of my meds. So, instead of understanding the current literature that clearly indicated that SSRIs could induce mania in those with BD, she tried to convince me I had a substance misuse problem. Luckily, I know myself and know that alcohol is not one of my demons. So, I went to a different doctor but I know that so many of us are young and confused and don't have the wherewithall or ability to change providers or even see that some of the people who are supposed to be helping us, aren't. It's incredibly frustrating as I am 50 now and have watched closely as the understanding of Bipolar Disorder has evolved.

I think therapists should be very careful about diagnosing and should defer to a psychiatrist whenever possible because they have exponentially more and better training. As for finding a specialist, I don't know if that's always possible. Personally, I went to a therapist who listed mood disorders as an area of expertise and told her I was Bipolar and currently in a mixed state to which she responded, ""What's a mixed state?"" I wasn't about to spend another penny on someone who didn't know what the hell she was doing. I wish you the best of luck."
bipolar,fn7a0vf,t3_g016ax,1586716218.0,"Yes, both my heart rate and blood pressure skyrocket to unhealthy high numbers during manic episodes but are otherwise within normal limits. It's horrible because I can often feel my heart beating out of my chest."
bipolar,fn70x6k,t1_fn6znav,1586711147.0,"Yes, I think you just answered your own question. If you were in an episode--especially if you were experiencing psychosis or delusions--they may have wanted to keep you until they could get you stabilized on meds. 

It is also my understanding that modern cars are made to produce less carbonmonoxide and it is nearly impossible to kill yourself with the closed garage method these days. Still, I don't think they should dismiss a depression dx but keep in mind you don't know what he told them at the hospital. He may have made comments that led them to believe that he was not an imminent danger to himself."
bipolar,fn6z3no,t1_fn6xmhq,1586710159.0,"Well, how exactly was he trying to kill himself? They will take the lethality of the attempt into consideration. I work as therapist in the school system and have kids who say they are going to climb to the top of the fence and then jump. I take this very seriously and always call for them to be hospitalized but, sometimes, they don't even take them because they send out a cop who is not properly trained and thinks that the fence isn't high enough to have caused death or simply can't be bothered to transport the kid to a hospital. There is so much that goes into the assessment and even then the risk assessments are flawed. Did you have a history of previous attempts? Would you have been safe at home in that you would not have access to your means of suicide? Certainly, those with Bipolar are more likely to complete suicide than some others with a personality disorder because those with Bipolar typically attempt suicide to actually die to escape the suffering of this horrible illness. It can also just come down to the people assessing your risk and how much space they have on their psych ward. It's not right but it's the reality I've seen play out more times than I'd like. I hate to say it but if they kept you longer than you needed to, I would wonder if they just had empty beds to fill. Nobody wants to admit that plays into the care you get but I've seen it first hand."
bipolar,fn6xg89,t3_fzur2u,1586709242.0,Wishing you well. You know we all understand. I look forward to hearing more from you as you recover and feel better.
bipolar,fn6x85i,t3_fzzmyn,1586709119.0,"In my state, they only keep you as long as you are an imminent danger to yourself or others. Protective factors like support systems are taken into account but if they thought you were in immediate danger, they would not release you. Still, I have to say that if your involuntary hold lasted nearly two months, that is most definitely the exception in my state and I've never personally heard of one lasting that long. Sectioning differs by country and state. I've seen people released like your friend's dad and it seems to depend on how serious the assessing clinician thought the attempt was and, unfortunately, I believe it can come down to space on the psych ward."

bipolar2,fn6veh5,t1_fn6cizz,1586708106.0,"Yeah, I'm aware. I'm a licensed psychotherapist and even I know this because I'm required to and I'm required to take continuing education to make sure I know what I'm doing. I expect the same from other licensed mental health professionals. I also suffer from severe mixed episodes myself and they are the most troubling symptom of my Bipolar. So, I take a personal interest in this shit and have no tolerance for clinicians or doctors who can't be bothered to understand the current DSM and the complexity of Bipolar symptom presentation. If your job is to help those suffering from mental illness, it is not ok to spout misinformation about mental illness and you should even have an understanding outside of what is described in the DSM or you shouldn't be practicing."
bipolar,fn52spn,t1_fn4ktfv,1586654567.0,"Yeah, it sucks. Even if you know they are wrong or misguided, it can feel like an attack on your self-worth and your very essence. It can really make you feel like shit. I used to be good at all of my jobs but as the years have passed, I have had to prioritize my mental health over job performance. It means that people don't always think highly of me at work but I just try to remind myself that I have other priorities. 

Something of note in your post that I also relate to is what I can only refer to as ""working below your capabilities"". I know that I have accepted a profession that does not challenge me intellectually because I have to save all of my energy for bad episodes. It means my job is not meaningful or fulfilling to me and that colleagues--who are typically fucked up and codependent--perceive me as ""not caring"" because I'm unwilling to work overtime for free or go out of my way for work-related shit. I just do it to pay my bills. I try to remind myself that they have no idea what I deal with and that there are times I can barely hold down a job at all."

If you haven't checed out his work, Dr. Jim Phelps write a lot of great stuff for those of us with Bipolar and a lot of it is free on psycheducation.org."
bipolar2,fn242hu,t3_fyvoto,1586577297.0,"I totally feel you!! Not to compare myself to a psychiatrist but I do work as a licensed psychotherapist and we are specifically cautioned against sharing any information with a client that could be harmful. We can even withhold records if we believe they could be harmful to the client's well-being. I've also noticed psychiatrists not wanting to say that they think I'm Bipolar. Years ago when I was first put on Lithium, I asked my doctor if that meant he thought I was Bipolar and he said, ""yes"". I needed to know! It also caused me a great deal of distress and a minor breakdown because I just wasn't prepared to hear it and already knew about the much poorer outcomes associated with BD versus MDD. Now, years later, I can see that what was more important was that I get the right treatment but also know that it was really important for me to tell my future doctors that I cannot take SSRIs and that I probably have BD. I didn't always do the latter because I struggled with it so much. Luckily, most of my doctors did an appropriate assessment and seemed to understand that I was Bipolar and treated me as such. I'm not sure why your doctor is hesitant other than the fact that it is such a severe mental illness and one thing I recently learned is that it can interfere with your ability to get your insurance to pay for TMS. I'd say, be glad if your doctor is willing to bill you as MDD and in your personal life when you are talking about your mental illness, stick to what you experience and know about yourself because even if your doctor had flat-out told you your dx, it is a spectrum and very different for every person."
