But as a thought exercise if I win a multi million dollar jackpot.  I would hire a lawyer and financial advisor to setup a trust account so I can claim the prize as a trustee, not individual winner.  As some state laws differ, I would annonimyze myself further by claiming the prize in a giant Gumby suit, so not to have my picture taken as a winner and under the name of a random trust that had no bearing to my life. 
I would then setup multiple family trusts at community banks so that I could add family members as trustees and disperse the money under the yearly gift tax, while collecting interest on the bulk of it.  
Then buy a place with high security where nobody can find me, to live my days in peace."

https://wreg.com/news/jonesboro-officer-involved-in-accident-released-from-hospital/amp/

He was transporting an inmate to the Craighead County Jail when the prisoner, identified as 19-year-old Logan Younger, was able to slip his left hand out of the handcuff and became “disorderly and aggressive.”

Younger then used the cuff to hit the cage. He eventually began doing the same thing with his feet.

As the officer began driving faster to get to the jail, the suspect pulled out a Zippo lighter from his pants pocket and attempted to start burning the rear of the car.

The report said it was due to these actions that the car drifted into a turn lane and then hit a manhole cover and began to lose control.

The vehicle soared across the two westbound lanes and hit the concrete curb, sending the car sliding sideways on the grass where it hit two signs, a telephone wire box and then finally a chain-link fence.

It was the impact of hitting the fence that sent the cruiser rolling over on its side.

Younger was reportedly ejected out of the back window during the wreck and tried to escape.

He was apprehended a short time later.

Edit:. Thank you kind Redditor for my first ever award. 

I hope you and everyone else have taken the opportunity to see the extended video with a split screen of the front dashcam view and criminal ('alleged') view.
