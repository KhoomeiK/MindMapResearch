But to be devil's advocate not all social constructs are bad. Its just that we only talk about them when they're bad. Technically we agreed as a society to not give children drugs or alcohol and that pregnant women shouldn't drink alcohol (at least in the developed nations). 

I think most people think there are levels of worse (hahaha). Its semantics really. I think we both agree we shouldn't touch strangers as a baseline. 

But I wonder would you charge someone that touched a stranger's shoulder with the same crime as someone who touched a person's privates?

Does the fact that it is touching and not slapping matter? What about psychological damage?

LifeProTips,ey3fsux,t3_cv66q1,1566763324.0,"I actually picked this up on my first job out of high school. What matters is speaking up in the first place and setting boundaries. Typically in a inoffensive tone but phrased in such a way that implies it should be obvious.

 For example, I worked in a busy grocery store bakery where stuff ALWAYS needed to get done. The store managers would get an idea and want to try it out, I'd say ""okay, but we'll probably not have time to do z thing today, is that okay?"". Sometimes I would get a ""really?"" And then I would calmly breakdown the proofing/baking schedule (working a busy bakery is like running a well oiled machine). This shifts the responsibility to them and gets them thinking. It wouldn't take long for them to defer to me about doing what's best. Sometimes, I'd be able to squeeze half the task, but they understood to not ask for the impossible. 

I only ever had issues with one manager in 3 years (he mostly waited for me to be done with my shift to go bother my girls, aka a power tripping fool). I had other difficult managers, but for the most part, I earned their respect by being respectful in interactions and when setting boundaries."

I think it's the general spirit of your post. 
See I don't think there's any glorification at all, but I'm on the other side so I see/feel it first hand. I'm in my late 20s and the amount of condescension and criticism I've gotten about my decision from total strangers is staggering. First three questions I would get after getting married were, ""what do you do for a living, do you have children and why not"" after which a rant by them ensues.  I'm a rather respectful, reserved person and it's an absolute disrespect to question someone's personal decision in this manner. It's baffling really. 


>It's not one or the other, it's all: a great experience, and yet a sacrifice at the same time.

And I can see that, but then again, it's the same with childfree people. We don't get to have that experience for whatever the personal reason is. 


>We have the technology (birth control and abortions) to allow people who can't afford kids to never have them, so I don't see this as much of a problem anymore.  Obviously there are politicians who are trying to take away some of these choices, which is just stupid and terrible.

And that's true, but I believe there isn't a more concerted effort to properly educate women and families that want children. I feel like they have to learn as they go. That part I believe is an oversight in the US and a disservice  to it's people. 


>The west is very quickly following in Japan's footsteps.  Europe has had below-replacement-level birthrates for years.  The US just had its lowest birthrate in several decades. Immigration is fine, but you're relying on someone, somehwere, to have at least a replacement-level birthrate.

And that is true, however, this is sort of a moot point. More children does not automatically equate a better society. I know news sources make a big deal of it because of social security, but if we reduced spending in certain areas we could easily fix that. 
Actually birthrates could bounce back if we fixed our national budget. People are more likely to have less children if they feel uncertainty about the economy. 

I believe low birthrate is a non-issue meant to scapegoat inappropriate spending at the federal level. More children = more taxes, but less spending = more balanced budget. Plus there's a general myth that the economy MUST keep growing in order to survive, but that's not true. A stagnant market is bad for investors in the short term. But that's another discussion for a different day lol."
unpopularopinion,ew1vuy2,t3_cmcdpu,1565032604.0,"Hmmm 
Ufff this gave me the biggest knee jerk reaction I've had in a long time, but I took a deep breath. I'm okay. 

A lot of others have made valid points, but I figured I would make two more points I haven't seen. 

First, if we are talking purely economics, there are plenty of ways the childfree contribute more. We literally have more capital to spend, invest and donate in other sectors of the economy. 

Second, children shouldn't be treated as a sacrifice. As a matter of fact, I believe that to be a issue of perspective. No matter what there is a trade-off. If you don't have children you don't get to have that beautiful incalculable experience. 

If you do have them while being financially unprepared then unfortunately it is the same as making an ill-advised investment. It happens and it is the responsibility of the grown adult in this case to tighten their belt the same way any other person has to do in the case of a ill-timed investment. This is why more people should advocate for better family planning education. 

Btw, Japan is a VERY specific scenario, their homogenous culture led them to that, but we in the US and in the west have easier ways to prevent that problem (immigration for example). 
   
It would make sense if you're asking for, let's say, paid maternity/paternity leave which we could pay if we lowered our very inflated defense spending. But to discriminate on the basis of familial status is not only anti-american, it is I would argue borderline unethical and a step backwards in society."

At LCB, you could get either a standard Culinary or a Patisserie and Baking degree. Culinary handles more with cooking, catering ect with two baking classes and the baking degree is the inverse. 


I have issues with LCB and private colleges all together now, so I recommend everyone go to a community college instead. That is if you're really passionate about food and you can handle the physical demands of a job in the food industry. That being said, practicing by yourself, understanding baking formulas and baking methods and getting a job in the industry is equally important. 


Hope that helps :)
