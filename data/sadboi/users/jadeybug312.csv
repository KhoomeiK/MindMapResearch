bose,fmh4i77,t3_fnr3ll,1586066480.0,"I actually just purchased with them, which is how I stumbled upon your thread!

I ordered a blue switch lite with pokemon shield for around 250. I thought a great price for the bundle, especially right now when regular switches and lites are skyrocketing in price and becoming scarce. When it arrived, I only received the switch. I contacted Google to find out if it was being sent separately for some reason, they told me the item was listed as a bundle ""accidentally"" on their site and there's nothing they can do for me because they don't have the products, the seller does. They can't even give me a partial refund for what just the switch lite is supposed to cost, as it was listed as 200 bucks alone, but I wanted this game anyway so the bundle made it worth it. If I want a full refund, I can send the switch back, and that's all they can do. 

Google sent me a $10 off my next order coupon and sent me on my way after like an hour and a half. I feel scammed though. I'm currently on the hunt to find a direct contact for Nationwide Distributors and falling short."

I don't want to be a downer, but fur turning a brown color can be a sign of numerous things, or it can just be the fur bleaching from being in the sun.

My mom's cat started turning brown, and we found out it was because she had kidney disease.

 We have a store cat where I work and he's turning brown from a thyroid condition."

visualsnow,feajt17,t3_eo6gig,1578949673.0,"I have trouble playing video games that are fast paced with high detail, and will purposely lower the graphics settings (if I can) to make it easier for me to see everything. I hate driving at night, especially with all these other cars that have those blue lights. I don't love watching TV with the lights off for too long as it messed with my image burn. I've become more sensitive to bright light. I have trouble falling asleep without noise distractions because I focus on the fuzziness when it's quiet. Anything better than 1080p looks the same as such to me, I've tried to compare 4k  and 1080p and can't tell the difference unless I'm 6 inches from the screen."

He was found 3 blocks away and had been there for a while as the people who found him fed strays near by. They found my missing cat post on Craigslist, which I was surprised to hear. 
Go out searching at night with a flashlight and look for eyes glowing. Put dirty litter boxes, cans of tuna, and clothes that smell like you outside to help guide him home. Make sure every police station, vet office, SPCA/shelter/rescue, facebook group, and pet store knows your cat is missing. ❤️"

cats,f4yul5x,t1_f4vl6hs,1571885700.0,"So now other people have to spend their money to buy products TO DEAL WITH YOUR CAT because they don't want your responsibility in their yard. Whether they're being destructive or not, they don't want them in their yard. It should be YOUR job to make sure they aren't a problem for others, not for others to find a way to keep your pet from being their problem. Do you not see how this makes you sound selfish?"
cats,f4vkcs1,t1_f4vjfej,1571843801.0,"You completely missed the entire point of my reply. Great, it's not illegal. It's not illegal in the US either. BUT OTHERS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOUR PET."
cats,f4vilfn,t1_f4vfx8f,1571843030.0,"Cat poo can be dangerous too. Ever heard of toxoplasmosis? Intestinal parasites? Giardia? Coccidia? If neighbor kids have a sandbox, cats loooove to poop in them, I mean look at it, it's a giant litter box! So, now little Timmy can find your cat's turd buried in their toy. That's a fun surprise! And if the kid is small enough, he then is playing in said giant litter box, and putting his fingers in his mouth. Delicious! Or how about if a cat sprays? That stuff STINKS. Now someone else has to deal with your cat's stinky pee on their house, car, garden, shed, etc. Not to mention urine on others property can kill grass and other plants. Other people shouldn't be subjected to have to clean up after your pet. Or allergies! Someone severely allergic doesn't want cat hair around their place, or cat urine as that's where the enzymes are that cause allergies, in the urine and saliva, but who cares about others! At least your cat is happy! 

If a cat goes outside it should be kept ON YOUR OWN PROPERTY. It is YOUR responsibility. Other people should not be subjected to your pets, their waste, and the damage they may cause. Not everyone wants a pet, not everyone can be around a pet, and some people will go to great lengths (poison, shooting, trap and given to a shelter) to remove the nuisance to their home."
