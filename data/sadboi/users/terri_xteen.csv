mentalhealth,ex5tfqp,t3_crjkau,1566031623.0,Do you know of someone you trust that you can talk to?  You are not alone. Otherwise there are helpline you can call. I have felt like this before and struggled on my own. Good on you for speaking out and seeking help on here.
mentalhealth,ex5sshq,t3_crj5rd,1566031178.0,"I am 29 yrs old and struggled with depression. The support around me has been vital for part of my recovery so it's so so nice of you to be helping your mother, that you are there for her & reaching out for help. Another part which has been important for my recovery is my diet. I take omega 3 fish oil and felt better almost instantly. I still take them to help my brain - it decreases inflammation in the brain. And eating a healthy diet in general is helpful. Keep being a support for your mother. Let her know she is not alone."
