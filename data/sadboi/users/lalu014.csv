I really appreciate your perspective."

therapy,fap4vc0,t3_ea74t5,1576279918.0,"I have struggled with this on what at times can feel like a daunting and massive scale. It's so hard for some of us to feel safe in love! 

I'm still in process on this one. It has helped me to name it and address the unaddressed issues brought up in childhood, etc, when all that emotional learning took place. Be kind to yourself. You were taught your needs were not the most important, that you could be told you had to leave your home for someone else! The message you got is that you do not feel good enough. I am so sorry that the adults in your life did not show you you were safe and worthy. Its that piece.  I got those messages too and they are a doozy to debunk, but not impossible! 

Try every tool in your toolbox - affirmations, listen to anything you can find on the subject, write it out, feel sympathy for your small self that was not made a priority by your adults. 

There is a good book on this that helped me - furthering the discussion on those with an anxious attachment style called Insecure In Love. 

For me, it has been key to have a partner that wants closeness and is reassuring and patient with me and the fears that come up in partnership. Because this is a thing in me. Maybe it will always be? I hope not, but it takes work and effort all the time for me to find the feeling of safety and security I crave. 

I know there are a lot of others struggling with this, so you are not alone in it. 

Best to you."

CPTSD,faoqr7k,t3_ea7vb2,1576270439.0,"Yes. I came on this thread today to recommend a video series on CPTSD from an educational series called Medcircle. The doc describing CPTSD described issues with attention when it comes to school and learning as one of the hallmarks of the disorder. We have trouble focusing. It's a true and a real thing and now they have the research to prove it. 

Sad, because for a lot of young children actively living in trauma, who are already in CPTSD brain will just be labeled with ADD, when really its that they are carrying a body of trauma with them everywhere they go that makes it very difficult to focus. 

I'm going to post about this video series because it was soooooo good for me to watch. It truly blew me away to hear someone talk about me and my struggles with such empathy, awareness and compassion. If you have an extra $20 lying around for a one month membership, I'd highly recommend it."

If you haven't read this book I'd really recommend it or listen to it. Audibles got it. Sorry you are going thru this."
relationship_advice,fahtsaw,t1_fahg18o,1576093337.0,"This. This is no way stating that OP should take the abuse, live with it, make excuses for it, etc. 

That said, Postpartum (in whatever form it presents) is real. Lack of sleep really affects mental health. Is your wife getting sleep? I imagine that is a relative question based on caring for a 4-month-old. 

Birth, babies and toddlers are hard on parents and marriages and postpartum can really exacerbate underlying mental health issues. 

I heard a midwife once say ""before you start a fight with your spouse, get a divorce or do something crazy, eat something and take a nap."" Meaning, ways to get some self-care while raising tiny ones has to be at the top of the list and somehow worked in. 

I am so sorry you are going through this. I am in no way excusing your wife's behavior. I would still be taking action to protect yourself legally and document everything."
raisedbynarcissists,f8whu15,t3_e2bew8,1574891137.0,"I'm sorry this was your experience. Your childhood was similar to mine. I was 5 when one brother was born, 10 when another was born, and 15 when my mom had twins. I was my mom's copilot and helped her raise the last 3 especially. 

Let's just take a minute to acknowledge that you were only 6. 6!!! and had to help raise twins. I know from experience the difficulty that comes with twins. Holy heck. It is hard. Especially when you are a sibling placed in charge of them.  

But, I am 37 yo and I feel like the damage of this type of childhood (or lack thereof) continues to come in waves. 

This is what I would tell you, knowing what I know now. Therapy is helpful and good. You know what your childhood was like and I know personally, how helpful validation feels. Like, when you look back, thinking did anyone notice this and what was happening? And your grandma is there saying, yes, I saw that. It did happen. I bet that helps your sanity! 

Your mom will probably never be the responsible person you want her to be. 

But, don't lose your mind, k? Freedom is right around the corner and when you are ready to fly the nest just focus on one thing: learning how to care for yourself. When we are raised this way we are taught how to put our needs at the very last and learn how to take care of everyone else first. Do you plan to move out when you turn 18? It might be a really good time to start setting yourself up to. The twins are not your kids and they will be okay when you go. You will get to make your own way, have your own life and choose how much influence you let your mom have. 

It is the strangest thing, the guilt that comes from being the oldest and feeling responsible for the kids as though they are *your children.* I struggled with this for years. Still do. But, you are right around the corner from getting to choose and make your life your very own. Hang in there."
CPTSD,f8bwffw,t3_e01w4p,1574446892.0,"You mentioned in a comment that therapy helped you uncover the rage.

For me, that was the thing. Feeling safe (safety for me came by way of a safe partner) allowed me to feel feelings and revisit trauma I had stuffed way down. Once I was able to feel my feelings, it was like they were consuming me. I went through a period of such rage. It was totally unfamiliar to me and it felt like it would never end and I was just likely to be an angry person now. The good news is it did start to shift and change. I do not feel as angry, but it had to burn there for a while. 

Is rage a new emotion for you? It was for me. Anger scares me. But, my biggest help was just to let it be there and let myself feel angry and not feel bad about it. Which is challenging if anger makes you feel scared. It can be a foreign thing to experience.  

When I was wanting to get better and started questioning why I was struggling so much, all this stuff came up. And, while really looking at the emotional learning that had occurred was probably good for me in the long haul, it was not pleasant at all! I felt rage at my parents, at shitty behavior, of people lying and hurting each other. I felt consumed. So, you are not alone! 

My therapist has given me a line I've found helpful. He asks me to use it whenever I am experiencing an emotion I do not like saying to my emotion, ""I see you. I hear you. I accept you."" He encourages that my rage is coming from someplace and deserves a voice. I've played with this a bit and it fits. When listened to, my anger quiets down. 

Healing trauma is no easy business and I think anger and rage are part of it. You are mad for a reason. You are feeling it. Sorry that it has been hard on you and best wishes in your journey."
relationships,f7zsvtq,t3_dy85iz,1574115622.0,"I very much relate to this post! 

Once I got sober, I felt like an alien. I found I didn't know the people close to me and they also did not know me... It has created a lot of interesting dynamics. I lost some people. But, I think of it as a good thing. I now have really deep relationships with the ones who have stayed close. 

I would sit down with your wife and just speak from your heart and tell her you realized you do not know her and want to. She probably already knows you are a little estranged from each other. As a woman, I know it means a lot just knowing your man takes interest in you. Let her know you'd like to relearn her and be close to her and get to know her. 

Ask your boys what music they like and watch their favorite TV shows with them - an easy in with your boy's age groups. 

It could be a very beautiful unfolding. 

Ask a lot of questions and listen to your family's answers. I'd encouraging asking the deeper questions, more thoughtful ones, and listening. You might surprise them, as well. 

I know this is a hard realization to wake up to but what a beautiful thing - to have this opportunity.  

You are blessed not to have died in that wreck as a lonely, disconnected alcoholic (been one myself) and getting an amazing second chance. 

You may even get to fall in love with your wife. 

Rebuilding trust takes time, but with patience and trying to keep a cool head, it can be done. 

Blessings to you on your journey. I hope you and your family can find healing together."
relationships,f796ask,t3_duvivu,1573503196.0,"""I am not planning on dumping him, so please, I would really appreciate some advice here on how to approach this issue and fix it.""

I want to point out all of your amazing qualities first. Just from reading this it is obvious you are considerate, aware of others, sounds like a lover of people and animals, you are a student studying in a different language (!!!), you are self-aware, insightful, intuitive, interesting, and a world traveler. You are also 28. Awesome. You have a whole life ahead of you.

I know that you said in the quote about you want advice on how to make this relationship work. I would really start by asking yourself why you think you deserve this kind of treatment from a man. I'd imagine it is because you suffered through an abusive relationship. At this point, anything would look like better treatment. I understand this. There is no fixing the type of character traits this man is openly revealing to you.

You know that wonderful Maya Angelou quote? ""When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time""?

I'd hit pause and really consider believing who this man is showing himself to be. This will escalate, get worse... your feelings about yourself will tank, because that's what happens when we allow ourselves to be treated like shit.

Ask the people who love you what they honestly think of him, of your relationship... I bet you'd be shocked. The people who love you probably hate seeing you treated this way, but are not trying to intrude.

This might be better than the abuse you were used to in a previous relationship, but this man is abusive just the same.

Find a way out now. You deserve someone who cares about your pet loss, isn't hiding strippers, or hitting on a woman sitting next to you.  You deserve someone who will bring you a snack from the kitchen.

I'd encourage you not to waste your time, sweet heart and great brain on this guy."
askwomenadvice,f5x36m7,t3_dpm71x,1572534681.0,"I went through this with a boyfriend. I told myself in the beginning that the contact between them would fizzle out and calm down. It did not. It got worse. And, then he was gaslighting me, acting like their daily text contact was just me being jealous... About 8 months into dating when I was really over it, he said, ""the two of you can be friends. It will be great. Let's all sit down and talk and you will see you are safe."" Sat down, and was open to being nice and friendly, and she said: ""I want him back."" Which became one of the oddest conversations I have had to date because I just get nicer and friendlier when I'm scared ;) 

We broke up 2 weeks later because he was still telling me it was my issue and to get over it. 

The truth is, their relationship wasn't done yet, not emotionally, at least. So, they just dragged me into their mess. It was really not good for my mental health and I realized I deserved a man that would treat me well. I found him. I would not recommend putting yourself through this."
ptsd,f216gou,t1_f212ysh,1569868509.0,"""I had similar feelings after my mother died. I was also by her side for a lot of it. She was a complicated woman. I miss her dearly and would trade a year off my life for one more with her."" 

You could not have said it better. I miss my mom like crazy. Took care of her through surgeries, was by her side constantly. She was diagnosed with cancer they said would take her in 3 months. She lived almost to 5 years and she died at my home. It was awful. She was complicated and beautiful and nuts and insightful. There is no simple way to put who my mom was. She was also my biggest supporter so losing her was really, really hard. Especially when things happen and I just wish I could call her. 

As for your friends - I hear ya. I have always been such a giver. Now on the other end of it I can't help but feel taken from. It is what it is, I guess. Someone else mentioned ""fair weather friends"" and that resonated. 

With all you have been through it makes sense to be devasted and hurting. 

Hang in there."
ptsd,f20zbhx,t3_dbdr4s,1569865893.0,"I am so sorry for what you are going through. 

Deep breaths, friend. 

I, too, am 37. I had a really long haul when all the trauma caught up to me. I have found the subreddit of r/CPTSD really helpful and validating. Seems a lot of members there also came from homes like mine - unstable, addicted, chaotic, fighting, abusive. 

The truth is, most people will just not get it. Your depression will be an inconvenience to them. Your diagnosis will frighten them. They will blame you for how you are doing. I feel like I am coming to terms with that people just will not understand. I intentionally distanced a lot of my friends and went more internal.

 When I was finally willing to feel my feelings, it was like I was drowning in them and there were so few that could understand. Most people made it about themselves or put forth a lot of attitudes that were victim shaming. 

I'm so sorry for your wife response. That had to be incredibly painful. 

Here are some things that helped me: 

1. **I think of myself as a trauma victim** and give myself some allowances there. Seems counter productive, right? To be the victim? And yet, just saying, yes, I was a victim of those circumstances was liberating. I try and be kind to myself as I make my way. Would you tell a war veteran just to ""get over it"" or ""no one is going to hold your hand"" ? No, and the people who would are assholes. I am a veteran of a different kind of war most people have no context for. If someone tells you this, you can kindly tell them to go piss off and take space from them.  
2. **I gave myself permission to be a wreck.** I was with my mom when she died. My mom and I had a long saga together. We loved each other very much and she was also much of the reason for my cptsd. The trauma of her death took 2 years to catch up. I have one friend I still keep close. When I told her, ""all of this is catching up with me. I can't breathe. I am drowning."" She said, ""Its about time. I wondered when it would hit you. How could you expect to walk away unscathed? You are only human. Feel it."" That permission to feel it and be sad and messed up for a while helped. 
3. **Recognized that my childhood is relevant.** It formed me. The trauma from childhood continued into adulthood. So, it wasn't just one thing I was getting over. It was a lot. Memories were repressed, re-entered, messed with my head, threw me for months at a time... and I am only human. Of course this affected me! Again, anyone who wants to tell me I am just being a victim can go f#ck themselves. They have no idea what I lived through, the pressures I was shouldering or what it means to live with my history.
4. **The Body Keeps The Score.** Buy this book today. You will feel a lot less alone and a lot less crazy. It is a scientific approach to how we are affected by trauma. I imagine you will find a lot of solace in there and stop taking on so much of the blame. 
5. **A good therapist.** Everyone will tell you this and they will say it for a reason. I went and saw 3 therapists before I settled on one. I conducted interviews, basically, and told them I was. Because I have a ton on my plate. Because I wasn't willing to go start unpacking this crap to someone that doesn't know how to truly get me some perspective. The therapist I found is incredibly validating and very supportive. 

In those photos you look back on - your life was cleaner because maybe you were doing a good job at normalizing. I kept it together for a long time, too. I was the one everyone came to with their problems. I was shocked when I finally got hit with feelings that they simply could not provide the same, and yet, there it was. 

You are not a loser. You are a person who has been through a ton of really hard things and now it is dominating. I had 6 months of being really down a dark hole. Constant flashbacks. I started really screening out the a-holes and opening up to those that could handle it and it helped. 

Be *so* gentle on yourself.

sex,eylogkm,t1_eylmkwx,1567188861.0,"Yes, just to clarify - not talking ""ticking"" as in to make someone laugh, but a different kind of tickling- using just the tips of your fingers or nails and running them very lightly and gently over the skin."

But, when someone is hurting on this level, I have found it really does help to clearly spell out how much you care about someone, how shitty their situation is and how much you see their hurt. 

Might help just to be there as her brother - even if she pushes you away at first. 

That old antic- Hurt people hurt people. 

Maybe just let her lash out for a second, don't respond or engage with her anger, and then state, ""I'm your brother. I'm here. I am worried. I love you. Can I please take you out to eat somewhere."""

CPTSD,eu84pnu,t3_ccyva5,1563549655.0,"One of the hardest aspects of abuse seems to be how crazy and isolated it makes you feel. 

For years, I would ask people ""Am I crazy, or did \_\_\_\_ just happen?"" ""Am I crazy to feel \_\_\_\_ emotion about it?"" 

I could not trust my view of anything. I needed others to tell me if my gut reaction to anything was accurate or if I was ""just being dramatic"". It meant that I stopped feeling feelings. It meant that I started to have very strange reactions to things other people could just feel - like smiling and laughing when scared or being bubbly and super nice to people who are initiating a conflict or attempting to cause me harm. 

My normal alert system of emotions went amok and in the face of hard stuff, I am that super awkward girl who has no idea how to defend herself from attack.

It is crazy-making when the adults you need protection and support from tell you repeatedly to shut down and shut up. I understand this one.
