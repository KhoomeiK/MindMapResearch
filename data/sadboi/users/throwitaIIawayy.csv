Chipotle,f99gsoa,t1_f98xyt9,1575191031.0,"That isn‚Äôt the case everywhere in the country. And before someone says this, it is not a solution to tell people ‚Äújust move.‚Äù Someone in the higher COL areas still has to do those jobs, not to mention people have family obligations, elderly to take care of, etc. and a huge cost barrier to moving that people living paycheck to paycheck can not afford. I grew up in Indiana where the COL is low, but now live in California due to a job moving me here. I lost that good paying (for Indiana - mediocre paying for California) job awhile ago (job interview on Wednesday - wish me luck!) and saw how quickly the difference can affect people who make a lower income. And I‚Äôm not even in the most expensive spot here. The expensive spots still have Chipotle‚Äôs and those employees should still be able to afford a basic apartment with bills, food, and transportation. Right now they can‚Äôt, and the increase in distance between CEO and employee income continues to increase. 

It doesn‚Äôt stop at the frontline workers. I worked in the marketing department for another well known restaurant chain and the salary was not proportionate to what someone in that role should be making in 2019. Maybe in 2010 it would have been fine, but COL is rising at a very high rate and wages (across the board) are not keeping up because those at the top profit from the increased COL at their own employees‚Äô expense; not to mention at taxpayers‚Äô expense. With lower wages, many have to resort to government assistance programs that are funded by us taxpayers. 

When minimum wage goes up, those at the top increase prices because they refuse to make a little bit less and this becomes a vicious circle. They are focused on a YOY increase and will do whatever they need to get it, even if it means forcing their employees into a YOY decrease (effectively speaking - taking inflation and hours worked into account - they won‚Äôt reduce the hourly rate - they‚Äôll run their businesses with fewer people and demand greater results from the few working, causing stress upon those that are trying to make ends meet)

Of course CEO‚Äôs and those at the top should make more than the frontline worker. Nobody is arguing that. What we don‚Äôt want is for them to increase the wealth disparity in America, which is hurting us. A 2015 study by the International Monetary Fund found that ‚Äúif the income share of the top 20% (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down‚Äù while ‚Äúan increase in the income share of the bottom 20% (the poor) is associated with higher GDP growth.‚Äù 

This is getting to be longer than I intended, but research the numbers for yourself of wealth distribution in our country. It is alarming how much the  gap has grown, and something needs to be done to stop it or our citizens will suffer (they already are) while a strong part of the population chooses to side with the top 20% because they‚Äôre convinced that one day they‚Äôll be rich and that they should think like the rich think. The problem is, the rich are one step ahead of them and will always make sure the bottom 80% don‚Äôt get what they have."
Chipotle,f98x5xc,t1_f96tsg0,1575184095.0,"I personally don‚Äôt get the circle jerk of people obsessed with looking down on fast food workers. They work hard for 40 hours a week (or however many hours they can get while their employers try to dodge fees and taxes and health insurance).The wages of fast food workers have not grown proportionately with inflation and increased cost of living. As profits have increased, companies have decided to pocket the money and leave their employees in the dust and continue to pay them less than it costs to live. It‚Äôs not illegal, but it is morally wrong and screws over people who work hard 40 hours a week. And the audacity of middle class people to say they don‚Äôt deserve a living wage is beyond me. This trend won‚Äôt stop at the fast food industry.

If an average/below average player has a good streak where they are winning some matches or have a squad that carries them to wins and sbmm puts them into a higher skilled lobby than they belong, is there a way for the system to demote them back to a more appropriate lobby? Many people feel like they‚Äôve been put into lobbies with players much more skilled than them (myself included) It really takes the fun out of the game to repeatedly get murdered upon landing every game or we end up hiding and camping out because we know we‚Äôre no match for the players in our lobbies.

FortNiteBR,f8vm0e1,t1_f8viz5t,1574872463.0,"Ranked doesn‚Äôt have fill matches. I‚Äôm not saying one time. I mean a system that sees a pattern, gives a warning first before leaving the match (you‚Äôve left X matches in the last 120 minutes before your reboot card was expired, leaving this match early will result in a 10 minute waiting weird before being able to ready up) ‚Äî something like that. I know shit happens, but it should be discouraged from being standard practice to disconnect as soon as you‚Äôre knocked/killed."
FortNiteBR,f8vjc0b,t1_f8vgmht,1574870747.0,"You don‚Äôt ‚Äúget good‚Äù by screwing other people‚Äôs game either. If you want to play until you get killed and then ready up again, play solo. You‚Äôll ‚Äúget good‚Äù by learning from your death if it‚Äôs that hard. You‚Äôre throwing a big middle finger to your squadmates when you disconnect as they‚Äôre trying to come revive or reboot you."
FortNiteBR,f8vazdl,t1_f8vacw0,1574864887.0,"If they‚Äôre trying to get you and you see them going for it, it‚Äôs respectful to let them try. It‚Äôs only 90 seconds before your card expires. If they‚Äôre that bad how did you die first? If you don‚Äôt like playing with randoms, play solo or don‚Äôt put fill on."
FortNiteBR,f8vavc6,t1_f8v9zxr,1574864799.0,"Then disconnect before dropping if you know they don‚Äôt have mics. That doesn‚Äôt bother me as much as me already putting my time/energy into reviving them. Plus, I have a mic and always communicate so that‚Äôs not my issue. It‚Äôs pussy ass bitches who cry when they get knocked or killed so they disconnect. Part of the game is reviving and rebooting teammates. Quit shitting on other‚Äôs game experience because you got knocked."
FortNiteBR,f8vamwj,t1_f8v7tqj,1574864618.0,There should be a distance rule. Like a warning/confirmation screen will show if your card has been picked up or if your squadmate is within a certain distance from your card saying you will be penalized.
FortNiteBR,f8v4cfh,t1_f8v3h3f,1574858993.0,I think he misunderstood and thinks people want sbmm undone altogether. All people want is for forced crossplay to be removed between console and pc.
FortNiteBR,f8v3vsu,t1_f8v3qb0,1574858493.0,"I leave only if the last squadmate who can get my card is halfway across the map and I know it‚Äôs impossible. Even then, if I see them turn around and go for it I usually stay until it expires out of respect."
FortNiteBR,f8v3tfq,t1_f8v3jbn,1574858422.0,"Exactly. You have found it more enjoyable not being in those lobbies. The skilled console players are asking for forced cross play to be removed from the sbmm for those tiers. They‚Äôre not trying to stick you with the sweats. If Epic implements what these players want, you will be in the same lobbies with PC players of your skill level. You shouldn‚Äôt see a change from what you‚Äôre experiencing now."
FortNiteBR,f8v3e6c,t1_f8v2la2,1574857947.0,"Please don‚Äôt take this the wrong way but if you aren‚Äôt at that skill level, you won‚Äôt be put into their lobbies. Neither will I, but I have friends that are very good console players and I‚Äôve played squads with them and seen what they mean. It only affects players in high skilled lobbies who have to make every millisecond count."
FortNiteBR,f8uykxl,t1_f8uxupp,1574851377.0,I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre the type of PC player that OP doesn‚Äôt want in their lobbies. They‚Äôre getting edited on faster than they can even see a refreshed frame and it‚Äôs a problem for many console players right now.
FortNiteBR,f8serc6,t1_f8selae,1574778799.0,Thank you. I had no clue it could be used for longer distances. I woke up still pissed off about it and decided to post. Thanks for the kind and straightforward answer. I appreciate it.
FortNiteBR,f8sdfsy,t1_f8sbh48,1574777757.0,I haven‚Äôt quit playing yet but I may. I quit buying V Bucks because if it doesn‚Äôt change I am going to quit playing and I don‚Äôt feel like wasting my money on something that I‚Äôll be dropping soon.
FortNiteBR,f8s9p4z,t1_f8s35xk,1574774475.0,Is this a hack? I‚Äôve seen it a handful of times lately. Visual sound effects on and still saw no footprints. Such a bitch.

One can‚Äôt have all  - some must come from external sources aka support system of friends/family Finding a person who lacks what you are strong in can make a strong relationship. Soulmates, even.

Work together to create actions Actions further develop personality

Helping brings joy Being helped brings joy

antiwork,f8r92x3,t3_e1oe72,1574734865.0,I was very close to joining the army and working in intelligence. I scored almost perfect on the ASVAB and they were throwing money at me. After they called my house on Christmas Day I told them to never call me again. I‚Äôm glad that happened.
FortNiteBR,f8jm7um,t3_e0ybx1,1574601975.0,DUMB FUCKS THAT DIE IN GAME AND THEN YELL THAT YOURE TRASH AS YOU KILL THE SQUAD THAT GOT THEM AND REBOOT THEM. IM NOT THE TRASH THAT DIED IN THE FIRST PLACE.
