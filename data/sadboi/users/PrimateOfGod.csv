Action- Can I in some way input action into this sequence or make it lead up to action?

Comedy- Can I make this scene humorous? Add a joke? Have something comical happen?

Romance- Can this scene have a shade of romance in it? (I’m not so great at this one)

DebateReligion,fqm62kd,t1_fqm3bx3,1589472122.0,"Keep in mind he said evidence, not proof.

I think that while it’s not inherently evidence of the supernatural, it gives good reason to think that there is something more to our existence, something greater beyond human understanding. Something that science and even human logic can’t touch.

It’s entirely possible that people halfway across the globe with no interference with each other came to similar yet vastly different concepts of our existence because of lack of understanding. It is also possible that they have came to some of those conclusions because they uncovered certain mysticisms of life, revealing that there is a reason for us being here, there is an intelligence responsible for the fabric of existence, and there is more to a person than just their flesh.

I think it’s a mix of both. Some truths were found by cultures while the details are based off misunderstandings of the truths."
