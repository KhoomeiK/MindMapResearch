My father is a cancer survivor and an amputee so he has a lot of meds he needs to take. My mom told her boyfriend and he and three other guys walked in when I was home alone and demanded I hand them his prescriptions. 

I did, of course. I was 13 and really didn’t want my head blown off. But thankfully I knew my father kept his most valuable and dependent pills in a secret spot inside of his prosthetic leg. So the guy got away with only some lousy diabetic drugs and not any pain killers. 

To clarify, my mother is dead now and no one in my family really knows what happened to her boyfriend. I’m assuming he’s still a drug addict somewhere."

Yes I’m already dropping out of the honors program. In truth, more so the people and professor involved rather than the academics. I’m pretty sure that’s just how that professor teaches as I have other honors classes that are way easier and have decent professors teaching them. I plan to drop out next semester or right after it.

From what I know, withdrawal period is over. I don’t know if they take special requests or even if there’s an office for such a thing. I’m a commuter so I’m hardly ever on campus so I wouldn’t be entirely sure.

The “bullshit” I was referring to is this: we have to attend every event and I mean **every event the honors program offers, which averages once a week in various times, locations, and activities.** No one likes them, they’re a huge time waster and I don’t understand why I’m being held accountable for events that don’t pertain to me such as internship nights (I’m a freshmen and they don’t even accept freshmen) and community service stuff.

I’m pretty sure there’s a mental health department on campus. I’m not sure how that will help me academically but I could go see them, sure. But I’m extremely not open to people, especially strangers. I’ll find it hard to open up about one of the worst issues in my life right now to a complete stranger."
