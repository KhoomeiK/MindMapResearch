Those dogs are amazing at what they do and are so smart but require so much training. In my experience (maybe I got lucky), but all it takes for a good emotional support dog is to adopt a young pup, and raise it yourself. No training required other than the normal house training and stuff. Just building the bond is enough. 

I fell into an intense panic attack the other day. Felt like I was having a heart attack. My dog was playing with a ball. Took one look at me, ran over, jumped on the bed, and laid his head and paw on me...just to let me know he was there for me.

I try to explain my opinion this way: I definitely think family history is a huge factor in mental illnesses. But I don't necessarily think that the actual action of suicide is something that runs in families or genetics. Dealing with and coping with something like depression ultimately comes down to choices. I believe its damn near impossible to break out of a depression funk and begin coping with it if you don't make the choice to better yourself. But therein lies the issue. In a deep, depressive state, one's mind is clouded. Therefore it affects the choices you make, and for some people, suicide is the choice they make. I guess what I am trying to say is that suicide is a by-product of depression, however it is still a choice. The illness itself can run in the family, but the choices in how to deal with it do not.

Suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems. The only thing is, while it may “solve” the person’s problems who takes their life, all it does is create massive (and sometimes lifelong) problems for the loved ones around them. It took me years to overcome my feelings of anger because I viewed it as selfish. And although I do still think it is selfish, I also understand that sometimes you can find yourself in such a dark place that there is seemingly no way out...because I’ve been there.

Unfortunately, even though for a lot of people, depression and anxiety go hand-in-hand, they’re almost polar opposites of each other. So I’m still navigating my own journey in finding the best strategy to help me cope. But as I stated earlier, I love this sub as a whole because just reading others experiences gives me ideas of ways to cope that I never thought of.

Anxiety,fab155h,t3_e89jb9,1575916317.0,"I struggle with anxiety on a daily basis my friend. An important thing to keep remembering is that you are not alone, and that it is often times something that is difficult to control. And most times it’s seemingly impossible to control. I’ve been a Reddit browser for years, but I never made an actual account until yesterday, strictly for the sole purpose of this sub Reddit. 

I’ve found that for me personally, a strong support structure is one of the best ways to cope. For me, I don’t really have that in terms of family. But I’m becoming more and more active on this sub Reddit, because it’s quickly shown me that it CAN become the support structure that I lack. It’s a comforting feeling just knowing that you’re not alone in dealing with it, particularly because I believe actual anxiety disorders are criminally misunderstood by those who have never personally dealt with it. 

One hour at a time my friend. Then, another hour at a time. Keep that mindset each day until you work yourself up to the point where you can take it “one full day at a time”. And NEVER just completely internalize it just because you are embarrassed, or don’t think anyone can help, or any other reason. Do you, be you, and take each day an hour at a time. 

I made my first ever post on here yesterday, and one of the responses to my post was particularly helpful to me. And I think it’s because it was an idea that had literally never even crossed my mind before. To summarize, this person basically said something along the lines of how they gradually started to view/use their anxiety as helpful and positive. When I read it the first time, I was kind of confused, because personally, my anxiety can be absolutely crippling at times. But the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. I think it’s a great mindset to take on. It’s not something that will change your anxiety overnight, and it WILL take loads of time and practice, but it’s definitely something I’ve never tried before, but will be trying to do from now on. 

Anxiety sucks, and it can completely debilitate someone’s life. And although you FEEL alone, you’re not. There’s plenty of people out there dealing with it, and the absolute beauty of that is the fact that everyone deals with it in their own personal ways...it just takes a personal journey of your own to find what works for you. 

I know that was a long post, but I hope it at least made some sense and was at the very least somewhat insightful or helpful."

Thankfully, when my episodes happen while I’m at home, I have a dog who instantly recognizes it, and will just lay next to me with his head or paw on me until it passes. That in itself is so incredibly powerful in helping me cope. He’s not even trained to do things like that, I have just raised him alone since he was 7 weeks old so he just...I don’t know...he just knows me."
Anxiety,faamwve,t3_e8auhk,1575910900.0,"I think everyone experiences their “episodes” in different ways, and with different symptoms.
However, I do think this is probably one of the more/most common ones that people experience in general. 

For me personally, while I do experience this, I most times feel other symptoms that scare/worry me more than this one."

To your one point: I have noticed that although my anxiety attacks sometimes have a trigger, I also sometimes experience some pretty frightening anxiety attacks when there is seemingly no trigger at all. For example, just relaxing on the couch watching TV, and then for really no obvious noticeable reason, I can feel a panic attack coming on. And then once that happens, it obviously expedites it and even sometimes makes it worse because at that point I start worrying about the attack itself. 

I suppose the “random” attacks I’m referring to most likely are also being triggered by something...but more subconsciously than if I am in a situation that is clearly stressful or affecting my mindset in anyway. 

That is what I find to be a huge struggle, finding out what triggers them, especially when I’m in a situation/environment where nothing should really be triggering it. 

As anyone who deals with anxiety issues can relate to, I’m just fed up of being frightened of my anxiety, because sometimes (at least for me), my panic attacks can literally make me feel like I’m like...having a heart attack and need emergency medical attention. I feel like that may seem like an extreme idea to a lot of people, but it’s a scary thing when you are afraid of what your own brain can do to the rest of your body. I hope all of that makes sense? I guess I’m trying to explain it as honestly and accurately as I can, but I think anxiety is one of those things that is just difficult to put into words."
Anxiety,fa9ft61,t1_fa9ezdn,1575872033.0,"I am actually a student majoring in Nursing. So I definitely understand what you’re saying. I definitely remember learning that in my A&P classes too. I know getting my breathing under control is a super important step to focus on, but for me, even if I’m trying to focus on controlling my breathing, sometimes it just doesn’t ease it. It kind of feels like the physical symptoms that I feel just overwhelm me to the point where even if I focus on breathing, the fear of what’s happening just continues the panic. Just a vicious cycle. Maybe there’s other breathing control methods I can explore and try them out! 

I had a pretty severe one just a few hours ago, and no matter what I tried, i just couldn’t regain control. I guess I just feel like I’m at my wits end because I feel like with how many methods and treatment options I’ve tried, I feel like I’ve made zero progress. Which as I’m sure you know, is incredibly frustrating. 

Also, thank you for the reply! I’m not necessarily new to Reddit, but I never really made an account and made any posts/comments. Just kind of used it to browse. So it’s nice to have my first comment on my first post! And thank you for your insight. I believe any insight or advice is helpful with regards to mental health."
