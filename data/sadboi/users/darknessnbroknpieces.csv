mentalhealth,fooidxu,t3_g8fq4i,1587939560.0,"I’m like this. And I’m starting to think my friends stopped caring now (I can’t blame them). When it happened before, I still get a message from them asking if I’m okay or just sending random stuff but I still ignore them. Then months later, I’m there again. Talking to them, sending random stuff. And they’re fine with it. They’re replying as if I was never gone. Then it will happen again. I think after some times of me hibernating, they lost interest anymore and move on. It’s not the same anymore these days. I feel now they’re only responding to my messages, like if I don’t send a message to them, I will not hear from them. Like what’s happening now, it has been two weeks since our last communication. And during those days, I was the one who’s always starting a conversation and I would get a single sentence or a single word reply. I can’t blame them for losing interest or care in me becase I feel like I’m being selfish, that I’m only responding when I feel like it. Because what if they need me during those times and I wasn’t there? But I just don’t have the energy sometimes. Then I would feel so alone, feeling like I have no friends anymore when in fact, I was the one who detached."

mentalhealth,fao6r6l,t3_ea10uy,1576258363.0,"I have this exact friend! We actually had a long, exhausting, bad argument about this just earlier! 
I asked her about such behavior. She just said she’s like that to the people she loves (and she can’t do anything about it because it’s her personality) and her behavior towards other people is just fake because she’s not close to them and she needed to be nice to them because she needs something from them and she likes to be friends to everyone (it literally bothers her if someone didn’t greet her when they pass each other). She told me if I want her to treat me like that, then we should not be close anymore. I thought it was kind of a twisted logic because for me, the closer I am to someone, the nicer I am to them. I just didn’t get that. Then she blew up and told me to just end the friendship if I can’t handle that. 

I just read from the responses here that when you confront or call them out, it may feel like an attack, which is truly what happens everytime I do that and I make it worse by saying “why do feel like I’m attacking you? I’m not attacking you, I’m just explaining myself/my side”. I didn’t get that because I was not really attacking her. So  thanks to the responses here, it gave me an insight and understand better why it may feel like an attack to her.

The only difference between the OP’s friend and my friend is when she sees/makes me cry, she gets even more upset with me saying why am I crying in a tone like I don’t have the right to cry."

She will always ask “do want to get away from me?” “Just tell me if you don’t want us to text!” — in a tone that is so pissed. Then, of course, I will tell her, it’s bot that. I just need a “me” time. Then she will respond with “just tell me if you don’t want us to be friends!” and it will go on and on and on and on...  I never got “me” time because I spent it arguing with her. 

So now, I learned my lesson. I never tell her I need a “me” tine. I just sneak out, pretending to be still asleep or about to sleep, etc. Anything to avoid that kind of conversation and let me recharge or have my personal space back. Lol"

I gradually restrained myself from looking at his social media accounts until he got married then I totally did not look at his social media accounts. There was one time last year, I suddenly thought of him and looked at his instagram (it’s always public), he already has a baby, but I realized, I no longer feel what I was feeling before.

And yes, sometimes I ask how do those terrible people still have friends. I just think that maybe they’re not that bad it’s just we don’t get along and I don’t like their personality but some people jive with that and like those kind of people.

Right now, I don’t know what to do with this pain. It’s harder because we’re in the same office. I would see her everyday and her other friend. I am thinking about applying for a new job somewhere else but that would take weeks or worse, months. What I also don’t understand is why do I feel guilty for leaving her. It’s like, I’m really the bad person here because I left her. But as you were all saying, leaving her was the right thing to do. I just can’t shake the feeling of guilt.

Looking back, I was fine being by myself. I am introvert and it was fine with me if I just sit alone at a cafe, for example. Then she came along. She approached me because she saw I was always by myself, quietly working, just minding my own business. She was having family problem that time (dad was at the hospital) so I was trying to be a friend to her. She told me later on that I was the only one replying to her when she needed someone to talk to. So we became friends. Then all the red flags showed. She’s clingy.

I should’ve walked away as soon as I saw those red flags but instead, I adjusted. Then... now, I became so attached.

AskWomen,ezbk9gr,t3_d0p3g6,1567821597.0,"I would like to know the answer to this, too. I recently left a toxic friendship but I feel even worse now. There’s an added guilt that I left her. That I was the one who left. I was the one who gave up. But I couldn’t handle it anymore. I just want to know that I did the right thing. 

TL;DR — I left a toxic friend but I feel even worse now.

I don’t understand why that friend always think of the negative side, always sees the bad side, always think that I am attacking  when I just simply trying to explain my side for her to understand. I know I’m doing my best for us not to fight anymore, for her to not get mad at me. I tried to do what she wants, I tried to please her but she always ended up getting annoyed. And then I will get the blame on the end — this is always the case especially when I try to explain myself. She will get hysterical, cry, will not listen anymore. It came to a point where I would need to ask permission just to do something because I’m afraid she would get mad for me for doing things without her. Even when I tried to calm my voice, calmly trying to explain to her my side, she would go mad and will not hear reasons. 

She would raise her voice and when I tried to level with her, she would get even angrier and then cry afterwards. Then I would feel the need to apologize. It was exhausting. And now that I left, she asked me if this is true over and over, and to my surprise, I said yes. Because this has happened before and I just kept on reaching out to her, trying to patch things up. So we became friends again, and the fights continues. It was a cycle. So this time, I am trying to break the cycle. I am trying so hard to keep myself from reaching out. 

But why do I feel so bad. I feel bad that I left her. I feel bad for myself because I am alone again. I only have three friends, including her. The other two were from college but we hardly talk and see each other now. So right now, she’s my only friend. She has many friends so it’s also painful to know I could easily be replaced. She has many friends but I don’t understand why she is treating me that way. I see how she treats her other friends, it’s very different. She keeps on saying I did that to her. That everytime she cries, I was the cause of it. Everytime she would go mad, it’s because of me. I am the reason for her suffering. 

I don’t understand, as I said, I was trying to do everything she wants and she’s still not happy. I tried to do everything, I even tried to change my personality just to please her. I wanted some alone time, she gets mad by that because for her it means, I’m leaving her. So I tried to avoid that. She wants to always talk, to text everytime,  I couldn’t keep up because I’m not good at making conversations and there are also times when I just to relax, not do anything. Of course, she gets mad at that, too, because communication/texting is important to her. So I tried to do that to the point where I text every little thing I do. I feel like I’m losing myself there.

And now, of course I am sad. No one is texting me. No one is talking to me. So I apologize for the lengthy post, I didn’t know to whom I could share this. I envy her for having other friends, as soon I left her, she went straight to her other friend. I wish I could have that, too. I am crying all alone, no one to comfort me. I know this was my choice. It was my choice for leaving. But why am I suffering so hard?"

lonely,ezbc0vf,t3_d0fjt6,1567817848.0,"I’m leaving for a few days with a couple. I’m going to be a third-wheel. We are not that close, I don’t know what I was thinking when I agreed to go with them. It’s gonna be exciting! (sarcasm). 

It seems everyone now is in a relationship. It feels a little less sad that I am (we are) not alone in this feeling. I am almost on the verge of giving up finding someone. I just recently left a toxic friend so now I am all alone. No friends. No significant other. No one. 

But I am still hopeful. I believe there is still a 1% chance of me finding someone (be it a friend or significant other) or them finding me. Because I don’t know how to get through this life alone."
lonely,ez8umcu,t3_czten7,1567760499.0,"This is what I wanted, too. Just one person. I only need one person. I thought I have that but eventually, we clashed. The more we became close, the more we drive each other crazy. The more we find out we’re not compatible. We came to a point where we argued almost everyday about petty things. Something I said will tick that person off. I don’t know why, but whatever I say or do, that person always tale the negative side of it, even if I meant well, which I always do. I always mean well. I thought I found my person. My best friend. Someone I can talk to about anything and everything. Someone I can share my experiences with. I love to travel so having no one to share the experiences with kinda means nothing. So I thought I found the only person I need to be a friend. Until just recently, I just had to leave. I had to let go. I realized I’m doing more harm than good. It was not good for both of us mentally and emotionally. It was exhausting. It was a really toxic friendship. I hang on for as long as I did because I literally have no one to call my friend. But the truth is, I wasn’t really myself when I was with that person because I keep on tolerating that person, I always gave in just to avoid conflict. Eventually, I got really tired. It drained me. I feel like I lost myself more in that friendship. Now, I’m all alone again. It’s hard for me to make friends. I’m so introverted. I’m not good in making conversations. That person found me,l. That person is friendly that’s how we became friends. But we are so opposite. I’m still hoping that someone out there would still find me and still wants to befriend me. And I hope that for the next person, we would be good for each other. Because, really, I only need one person."

It’s not a nice feeling, I think I’ve been able to control them long enough but I guess that is not a proper way because it’s like I’ve been keeping things inside that one prick, I just exploded."
AskReddit,ez42tlb,t1_ez41brd,1567679980.0,"It’s not just little things. I guess, I’ve been keeping things inside, this is not an excuse but that’s why. Also, I keep telling the person enough already but that person keeps pushing, keeps provoking. When I tried to walk away, I’m being chased down and still continue to argue. I am not making excuses for the way I reacted, just trying to clear up that it’s not just “little things”. And I think I’ve been patient enough and controlled enough."

This is exactly what I’m feeling! Sometimes it’s fine because I get that peace of mind but most of the time... oh boy, it makes me think what’s the point of living? Why am I doing the things I do if there is no one to share it with? I am just taking up space in this world. If I die, probably no one would notice."

Fake a smile until you’re smiling genuinely. 
Fake being happy until you become genuinely happy. :) 

Also, surround yourself with all-smiley, upbeat people. Because such energy is contagious!"

Being terminally ill would just leave you with no choice but to get worse, and you have no control over it. You will just get worse and worse and worse having an illness."
offmychest,evkc09s,t1_evjnmu9,1564579165.0,"Because that’s what people want to hear. Try telling them “no” next time they ask if you’re okay, see their reactions. I bet they wouldn’t know what to say or react because they are not prepared for that kind of answer. They just expect you to say “yes, I’m fine” all the time.

Sometimes I feel like people just ask that question out of politeness. Like if you see an acquaintance on the street and the first thing they say is “hey, how are you?” But they don’t really mean it, they don’t really wanna know how you’re doing. It makes me wonder sometimes if there are people who really cares."
