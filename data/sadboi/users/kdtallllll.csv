PEDs,fr27wfo,t3_gm8830,1589832671.0,"I guess I’ll throw in an unpopular opinion here: definitely use the SARMs to get back into it (if you will stick to good form, workout regiment, and diet). You mentioned in this thread you used to work out 6 years ago. now I’m not sure how long muscle memory lasts but when I had to leave the gym for almost 2 years due to a back injury, I used LGD to get me back into it because I’m a very impatient person. Whether this was the smartest way to come back is up for debate. That being said, muscle memory+LGD completely recomp’d my body and did a fantastic job doing so. 

If you truly know what you’re doing, and I see you saying that you do, then don’t listen to these guys saying to hold it off for 6-12 months. There’s absolutely no reason to not use SARMs to kickstart yourself. If the cycle doesn’t go well because it turns out you overestimated your knowledge of fitness then, along with maybe a few sides that can be easily corrected, it’ll just be money down the drain.

If you’re not 100% sure on proper form and resting periods though DO NOT use SARMs yet. If it’ll take a month or two to get back to that level where you feel confident in your fitness abilities then wait the month or two. People seem to think they’re super heroes when they’re cycling anything and tend to go way harder in the gym. If they’re not prepared to do this properly then this can lead to bad injuries. Don’t make that mistake. Remember, fitness is not a 6-12 week long mission. Fitness is a journey, and you need to be able to be in it for the long run.

Whatever you do, best of luck with it!

Edit: also fwiw I’d go with moderate deficit on your TDEE. Unless you’re getting ready for a competition and are already packing a lot of muscle then there won’t be much to reason to cut for with SARMs. The purpose of using SARMs is going to be to help you get stronger. It’ll be a lot harder to get stronger while at a high deficit, even on SARMs. You can always increase your deficit after the cut, but to get the most bang for your buck with SARMs you’ll want to be gaining the most muscle possible from it. Even eating at moderation wouldn’t be a bad idea imo. More muscle gains that way. I don’t know which one would help you achieve your short term goal quicker, but I never cut on any cycles anymore. In the past when I would cut on cycles I wouldn’t get as good results. Sure, I’d lose BF% quicker. But the muscle I didn’t gain would have helped me look better and be much stronger in the gym for future workouts"
