I really wanted some of your story, we have been following you for over a year and have seen your determination and your positivity in the face of great adversity. It would be great to learn more about you and where you have come from. More of your journey. How you have made life better for yourself! I think that would take this to the next level. 

Oh and totally wanted to join you! Looked like so much fun. Maybe one day aye!

Love you, Motivation Man! 

Keep crushing it."

I know he promotes himself despite opposition because he believes in what he is doing. I know he is willing to be vulnerable with the world by not hiding and literally laying himself bare. I know he is brave. I know he has a work ethic like almost no one I know. 

I know he dares greatly everyday and I know that it is not the critics who count.

I know he inspires me and I hope to be an inspiration and support to him too."

Awesome to see you‚Äôre still crushing it!"
ptsd,f70kkns,t1_f6yihw0,1573329442.0,Thank you. I really wish you all the best with your recovery too. I know there were times during my therapy where I felt like I wasn‚Äôt getting anywhere. It can take time and hard work and a therapist who can help you get to the mechanisms maintaining the trauma. Rather than just symptom management.
ptsd,f70k7vs,t1_f6wxec5,1573329291.0,"I was pretty scared at the time to be honest. However I knew intellectually that there was nothing they could do anymore, they didn‚Äôt have the power over my life that they had at the time of the trauma. Meeting with them helped be to understand that on a deeper level. It was also massive to be able to say to tell them what my experience of the events had been and that even though they hadn‚Äôt intended to hurt me (they were trying to help) that what they had done had traumatise me. Regardless of their intentions my trauma was valid.
For me this made a big difference. My therapist didn‚Äôt push for this I did (don‚Äôt think you need to worry about that) I knew it was time for me and I wanted to. 
For me it was the last piece in the puzzle and helped me get out of the PTSD. However hard and scary it was I‚Äôm glad I did it. 
I imagine it‚Äôs different for everyone and really depends on how you got traumatised. 
I do believe recovery does involve leaning into uncomfortable things. Learning to allow vulnerability in your life. Something that is definitely the first thing to go when we get traumatised."
ptsd,f6vh0xo,t3_dt7ra5,1573185987.0,Therapy helped me to recover from PTSD. I had a great therapist and this wasn't the first mental illness we had worked through together. We kept going till a bit after i was assessed as no longer qualifying for PTSD. That way I was pretty confident I could do it on my own going forward. It was hard work and I had to face my fears. I ended up meeting up with the people involved in my trauma as part of my recovery. We met for mediation so I could say what I needed to say to them. That was very empowering.
ptsd,f6nyrwz,t1_f6nstse,1573003443.0,"That last one especially ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Like we choose to have flashbacks."
ptsd,f6letes,t1_f6l2ye2,1572941042.0,Maybe if they are trained professionals and you are going through a recovery process with them and they know how what they are doing so they aren‚Äôt re-traumatising you. However I‚Äôm guessing this type of person is not that. I can imagine their response to you sharing probably isn‚Äôt going to help with your recovery. Just an inkling I have.
ptsd,f6lebup,t1_f6l2w11,1572940355.0,Can I just saw wow. That is not the sort of human being I want in my life and I think you deserve way better than this. Your trauma is valid and this person doesn‚Äôt get to define its validity. This person sounds pretty traumatising to me. Hope you have other people in your life that are supporting you through this.
ptsd,f6kw30k,t1_f6kuzla,1572922161.0,Thank you for sharing this. Does really seem to be a common one that can be so invalidating for those of us with trauma outside of combat.
ptsd,f6kvzu2,t1_f6ku643,1572922097.0,It‚Äôs also so much more to work through when you have that level of complexity. Something that is not acknowledged with this assumption. Each of your traumas are valid and deserving of compassion and understanding.
ptsd,f6kt4vd,t1_f6korry,1572920080.0,This sounds like a hard one to respond to. It‚Äôs invalidating and almost begs to have you justify and share how bad it was. Something I don‚Äôt believe you should ever feel you have to do. The thing is a person who says or assumes this doesn‚Äôt seem like a very safe person to open up to. It‚Äôs probably why they don‚Äôt realise how hard it is for you. I hope you have other people in your life who are more supportive and understanding. You deserve to have that.
ptsd,f6ksv5i,t1_f6krn1d,1572919891.0,The fact you can get PTSD from so many different situations is why I think validating all trauma is so important. You are so right that PTSD is complex and people can definitely respond in a range of different ways. That it isn‚Äôt always obvious. Part of the struggle I think is how easy it is to fall into patterns of avoidance and withdrawal. People don‚Äôt see how much we struggle and don‚Äôt get how big an impact it has on our lives.
ptsd,f6kslms,t1_f6krxrw,1572919707.0,I‚Äôm getting the impression this is quite common. It‚Äôs great there is awareness of what some war VETs go through but hard for those of us who didn‚Äôt get PTSD that way to be put in that box or have our experience seen as less than.
ptsd,f6ksdsr,t1_f6krimx,1572919547.0,These sorts of assumptions can be minimising of your experience and your trauma. It sounds hard to have that sort of violence assumed about you just based on your appearance. This shows that we all respond differently to trauma and you can‚Äôt make assumptions about how someone will respond to a trigger based on how they look. That you for having the courage to share this.
ptsd,f6kmcx1,t1_f6km1m3,1572915217.0,This is invalidating of what you have to go through now. I want to say that I agree with you that your trauma is valid.
ptsd,f6kl0l6,t1_f6kk3zi,1572914239.0,"Man that sort of belittling comment shows so little understanding of the struggle that we go through. If we could just ‚Äúget over it‚Äù (like recovery is something simple) then we would. I wonder if it is their way of removing any form of responsibility that they have to love and support you through this.
The ironic thing is I imagine they are uncomfortable with seeing others suffer and don‚Äôt want to sit in that discomfort. Not realising how much intense discomfort it takes to go through therapy and recovery for the person with PTSD."
AnxietyDepression,f0v3hc4,t1_f0ulcap,1568961705.0,I‚Äôm so glad to hear. There is hope and recovery happens.
Anxiety,f0tkhpg,t1_f0snsun,1568923819.0,I feel ya. Back when I was depressed and it felt like it just kept coming back again and again it felt pretty hopeless. It‚Äôs so hard being in the middle of it and not able to see the way through. It really sucks. I needed other people to be able to see me getting better when I couldn‚Äôt.  To believe when I felt it was hopeless.
AnxietyDepression,f0r6djw,t3_d62iqm,1568875170.0,"I just stumbled on this and I wanted to share that today was that day for me. I sat down with my therapist of 6 years and realized it was time to finish up. Not just the session but therapy. I got there. I got through the crap and darkness and hopelessness and fear. I found purpose and hope and courage and joy. 

I know life is a mixture of emotions and I can cope with them as they come. 

Life isn‚Äôt just fine it‚Äôs great. 

I hope this gives you hope that it is possible and there is a light at the end of the tunnel. It‚Äôs hard work to get here and a lot of it goes against the gain. And it is possible and it can happen. 

I had to think twice before adding this as I know this maybe hard for some to hear who are in the middle of the hardest and darkest times. However it was a family
Member of mine that shared she had gotten through it that gave me the hope to stick around. I hope that does that for one other person then this was definitely worth posting."
ptsd,ezqons7,t3_d1ibjt,1568062030.0,"The thing with depression (does sound like depression) is it‚Äôs like a hibernation. We do this when we feel hopeless. Are you having thoughts about anything in your life being hopeless? Likely you‚Äôve slipped from something your anxious about being highly likely to being certain. So feelings of hopelessness can come with that. 

This is something I found really interesting when my psychologist husband mentioned it."

ptsd,eykcn7f,t3_cx2rb3,1567145145.0,"Yeah it is. Your trauma is valid, it‚Äôs really important to remember that. That validation has helped me recover, I think it‚Äôs an important part of recovery.

I actually made a video on why validation for trauma is so important. If you are interested I can add a link."
ptsd,eyj8uox,t1_eyd5oyq,1567114304.0,"It‚Äôs really great to hear you have this support. I can understand this being a really important part of what you do. Awesome you have people who understand your situation and care about your safety, there if you need them. To know your not alone when you are in a vulnerable situation is so important for so many of us and understandably is for you."
Anxiety,ey7c23e,t1_ey716fr,1566877901.0,Yeah I‚Äôm doing great. Managed to recover from PTSD and get rid of my panic attacks! Will be releasing my first course in collaboration with my husband (clinical psychologist) on panic next month! So excited to be able to turn my suffering into purpose and help others get back control of their lives!
ptsd,ey4si4g,t1_ey4ntey,1566805717.0,I think it‚Äôs vital to recovery and something we have to keep reminding ourselves of. Even when we are largely recovered it‚Äôs still valid in whatever form it may pop up in. Whatever piece isn‚Äôt fully recovered is still valid. Also the recovery you have achieved is valid and isn‚Äôt negated by still having other things to work through. I‚Äôm so glad this message got to you when it did.
ptsd,exwfgwq,t1_exw9zcf,1566618670.0,"Yeah I feel ya. We do this to ourselves just as much if not more than other people. That‚Äôs way it‚Äôs so important to keep validating in. It is valid. It is worthy of compassion and understanding (especially from ourselves). It is worth working through and recovering from. 

Thanks for sharing this. I‚Äôm pretty sure your not the only one."
ptsd,exvt309,t1_exvs53f,1566606067.0,I‚Äôm so glad I did this then. Totally worth it!
ptsd,exvbf5r,t1_exuz2j9,1566596258.0,That is exactly what this post is. It‚Äôs what I needed to hear. What I needed to tell myself. When I got it made such a difference. I‚Äôm so glad you too are motivated to share your gems with the world! We all go through hard days and when someone says the thing they needed to hear to you as well it makes the world a better place.
ptsd,exvazwj,t1_exu67s6,1566596059.0,I find we can be the worst when it comes to invalidating our trauma. I share this because it has been my struggle too and one I have had to work through to recover.
ptsd,exvas9x,t1_extmu7x,1566595932.0,There shouldn‚Äôt be. If you suffer through the symptoms of trauma it shouldn‚Äôt matter how you got it. You deserve support and compassion and validation
ptsd,exvamak,t1_extj6j2,1566595834.0,"Exactly. This is way validation and support for everyone who is traumatised is so important. Regardless it‚Äôs so important to have support, compassion and understanding."
ptsd,exvafup,t1_exswqf3,1566595727.0,I‚Äôm really sad to hear that. I can‚Äôt see how that can be helpful in anyway. I‚Äôm so glad I could be the person who affirms it‚Äôs validity.

Your trauma is valid."
Anxiety,evrh1c9,t1_evrgehm,1564708170.0,"Happy to slap you in the face with a compassion hug anytime.  ;-) I think we need way more of that in the world. Found it really interesting Brene Browns research on compassionate people. I was blown away to find out the one thing they have is really strong boundaries. That and that they seem to believe that others are doing their best and then act accordingly. Rather than trying to manipulate them into doing differently or guilt them into change. They set boundaries to keep themselves safe and then help without judgement. We need more people like that. 

I want to be that person to myself. I want to believe I‚Äôm doing my best. And have compassion for where I‚Äôm at right now. Knowing my current limits set boundaries so I‚Äôm not expecting more of myself then is reasonable, 

Current work in progress. Being compassionate to others is like compassion practice for how I want to treat myself. Somehow compassion with others feels easier. Do you find that?"
Anxiety,evrexgt,t1_evrdptn,1564706878.0,"I wish I could change the way you see yourself. Sounds like you have way more compassion for others (not wanting them to be hurt) than for yourself.  

Man I can relate to that though. I struggle with feeling like a failure because I have been fighting anxiety, depression and PTSD for years rather than working. If I had compassion in drug form I‚Äôd definitely send it your way. Sounds like you need large dose of it.  Life sounds hard and I know your doing your best right now."
Anxiety,evrd6h5,t1_evrckav,1564705859.0,"I can understand being in that place. Been there myself in the past. I didn‚Äôt want to suffer but I didn‚Äôt want to keep living. 

Is there anything specific in your life that affects how you feel about living that if that changed you might not feel like dying?

I remember at one point it was a horrible job. I‚Äôm dyslexic and didn‚Äôt know it at the time. I was doing paperwork and i was drowning in it. I couldn‚Äôt meet the expectations and I couldn‚Äôt see a way out."
Anxiety,evrafxy,t1_evra9to,1564704259.0,I was wondering if that was the case and that‚Äôs huge! I know getting past my anxiety and mental health struggles is massive for me too. I agree that most of my life problems would be solved if I could do that.
ptsd,evmi0tg,t1_evlph5a,1564608307.0,This is awesome. I think it‚Äôs so great to hear about the growth that a person can undertake. I really admire that and the courage to share it too. It feel so happy to hear about your healing and peace. That‚Äôs awesome and really encouraging for me.
ptsd,evmhpso,t1_evjyz4i,1564608188.0,Loving this. So often I talk to myself in a way I would never talk to anyone else. Working on this currently. Thank you so much for sharing about this. So on point!
ptsd,evmhe5k,t1_evjr28x,1564608059.0,Yeah it seems like one off trauma is not as common as lots of mixed trauma. Yay for living in a traumatic world. I know that the reason I got PTSD this time was because I had past trauma that made what happened traumatic for me. That compounding effect can be hard. I do think trauma has a lot to do with how we view ourselves and that‚Äôs why I wanted to ask this question.
ptsd,evmguw3,t1_evj7xxh,1564607852.0,Thank you. I‚Äôm working on a video validating trauma and I started thinking about how I sometimes feel like a failure and wondered if others did too. It looks like something a lot of us struggle with and I really hope that this will help us to not feel so alone. Thank you so much for your message.
ptsd,evmgkdv,t1_evj7ciy,1564607738.0,I‚Äôm trying to shift my thinking to believing in intrinsic worth. That I am worthy regardless of what I do. I am valuable because I am me. That I am doing my best right now and that‚Äôs ok. It has been helpful actually to shift my thinking to believing everyone is doing their best. It helps me to have more available compassion and then redirect some of that towards myself. At the same time some days are harder than others and I struggle with shame around not being good enough. It‚Äôs a journey.
ptsd,evifu1a,t1_evi7jcw,1564541941.0,Love this. Thank you. I am currently in the funny position of feeling proud of myself and struggling with feeling like a failure. I recently found out that I‚Äôve recovered enough not to technically have PTSD anymore which is so massive for me. I‚Äôve fought so hard to get to this place. At the same time I struggle with feeling like a failure for the years of not being able to work and contribute like I see other around me doing. Like I missed the boat and I‚Äôm behind. Does that make sense?
ptsd,eviffav,t1_evi2gyk,1564541757.0,"Oh man the intelligence thing. Yes that is me too!!! When I got depressed I felt like I lost my intelligence. It‚Äôs interesting talking to my husband (clinical psychologist) about depression being like Hibernation, conserving energy. And guess what consumes the majority of our energy... our brain. So makes complete sense that this would be impaired when depressed.

I didn‚Äôt know this at the time and just felt like I had lost that most important part of myself. The thing I had pinned my value on. Man I love what you wrote about value. So so good. Thank you. Your contribution in this way does not change or impact on your value. I do really appreciate it all the same and love talking to others with this level of insight and sensitivity"
ptsd,evhwi5s,t1_evhv9mp,1564533264.0,Yeah I hate having to apply for support. Trying to convince people you can‚Äôt do stuff takes a toll on how I see myself and my abilities.
ptsd,evhw604,t1_evhv9mp,1564533114.0,"I think this is the part of trauma people can miss. Yes it‚Äôs really hard having flashbacks and being super anxious and hyper vigilant. However under the surface of that is the struggle with how we view ourselves. 

I think in a world that values what you contribute largely through work and finances people with PTSD can feel worthless. 

I‚Äôm working on redefining where my value lies. Ultimately I want to get to a place where I can see my intrinsic value. Something I have without needing to do anything. That I have value because I am me. I am worthy of love and belonging regardless of what I contribute.

I‚Äôm finding it easier to start by seeing that in others. I know you have value because you are you. You don‚Äôt have to do or be anything to prove that. You are worthy of love and belonging."
ptsd,euuebri,t1_eutvoel,1564042637.0,"I‚Äôve done a range of things. Actually did a short video on it that I can send you the link to if you want.

One thing my dog didn‚Äôt like was the trailer. That took some adjusting. I put him in a dog trailer when I get to the supermarket. That way he‚Äôs safe and secure. He really hated it to start with. However I think he learnt that after being in the trailer for a little bit he got another run so he now jumps in before I can even properly open it.

ptsd,etk0spc,t1_etjxlzz,1562886048.0,The thing is I got PTSD from the medical team trying to help me. I found the way they pushed for medication for sleep deprivation very traumatic.

ptsd,etjl6jw,t1_etieskr,1562875927.0,I think it‚Äôs great this person got what they needed to recover. At the same time not everyone does it using medication.

I‚Äôm different but I‚Äôm still me.

The depersonalization sounds awful. When you talk about your emotional pain it matches what I have experienced and hear in the research. Emotional pain and physical pain are experienced in the same way. 

I have experienced panic myself and it is scary feeling like you might loose control or loose your mind. That‚Äôs quite a normal thought when it comes to panic. It doesn‚Äôt mean you will. Leaning into that discomfort is part of the work. I am doing a lot of leaning into discomfort recently. It sucks, don‚Äôt get me wrong. However for me my illness has been in big part my unwillingness in to lean into painful  and uncomfortable emotions.

I agree that it‚Äôs easier if you get treatment early and start by moving in that direction. I disagree that that is the only path to recover.

It sounds like you are having a really rough time. That life is lonely and you feel really angry. It‚Äôs understandable to feel how you feel. Sadly you are not alone in the way you feel. Many people feel the way you do. I have felt the way you do."

Not all people see you like this. People with compassion and understanding of what you are going through can see your value. They also see your strength. 

I can see your strength and bravery in being vulnerable enough to share with people that you have trauma. That takes a truck load of courage. I feel angry that after you showed that much courage they couldn‚Äôt see your incredible strength. The intelligence of not keeping your shame hidden but speaking it out. 

They are blinded to your true worth and miss out accordingly. 

Know not everyone is this blind and judgmental. 

When we are courageous and vulnerable, sometimes if blows up in our faces. However it can be the path to real connection and acceptance. Letting people see who you are is worth doing even if sometimes it hurts like hell. At least you are true to who you are and are valuing yourself."
ptsd,esmt6y4,t3_c8ha3u,1562114107.0,"Sounds like your doing pretty well on self care if you are managing those things in my opinion. I personally eat healthy nutrient dense food, try to exercise most days, work on getting to bed moderately early and trying to get 8 hours sleep (bit of a mission with a toddler). Dressing each day is important and the showering every other day. I find the odd massage is a nice bonus self care treat. What treats do you do just for you that make you feel warm and fuzzy?"
ptsd,eskd011,t1_eskcurj,1562060284.0,Thanks. I‚Äôm learning the bravest thing is letting myself feel uncomfortable emotions. That‚Äôs this exercise in a nutshell. All sorts of uncomfortable emotions. It‚Äôs taken 6months from suggesting the possibility of this meeting to being actually ready to do it.
ptsd,es530ds,t1_es52w70,1561600449.0,I love the name Panda! Dogs are awesome. üëçüòÅ
ptsd,es50j38,t1_es500gk,1561598718.0,"1. Thanks so much. We really want to make quality videos to help people. I‚Äôm so glad you liked it. 2. Hehe.. that would be what I call my kiwi accent üòÅ (I‚Äôm from New Zealand). Toned down by voice lessons and drama. 

So I‚Äôm Becky and Momo is my awesome dog. He pops up from time to time in our videos. He‚Äôs the massive white fluffy guy. He has helped me so much with my PTSD."
ptsd,es4umrr,t1_es4udsz,1561594343.0,"Yay! I‚Äôve popped a link to my latest progress video:
https://youtu.be/1djpKmlWp_0
I‚Äôd love to hear any of your thoughts about the channel and your own journey.
Feel free to private message me if you would like."
EOOD,es4tqsy,t1_es4q0gk,1561593672.0,Exactly. There is so much we can learn from our 4 legged friends!
ptsd,es4h73t,t1_es4g6v2,1561584755.0,I‚Äôm so happy this got to you. I agree it can feel so bleak and lonely having PTSD. It‚Äôs actually part of why I works so hard to overcome it. I want to know for myself it‚Äôs possible and I want other people to know that too. Hope is such an important thing. I‚Äôd love to have you join me on my journey. It makes it so much more meaningful when it‚Äôs shared. I have a YouTube channel where I share my journey. If you want I can give you a link to it.
EOOD,es4eito,t1_erq6r01,1561583040.0,Agreed they really are!
EOOD,es4ehll,t1_erpxdns,1561583019.0,It so is! Something really primal about traveling with your dog. Seeing him running along so happy.
EOOD,es4eei8,t1_erp9c07,1561582964.0,I really agree with this. He really helps me get out and when I do I enjoy it that much more cause he‚Äôs with me
ptsd,es4demj,t1_es3uhww,1561582355.0,This has been one of the best the best things I‚Äôve shared and one of the most valuable things I have learnt during my struggle to overcome PTSD. I‚Äôm so glad it has helped you. You are so welcome
Anxiety,erdvjws,t1_erdvb68,1560759969.0,"I think it‚Äôs so important to hold to the validity of your trauma. Your trauma is valid. Male or female it doesn‚Äôt matter. You need and deserve love, support and understanding. It‚Äôs so vulnerable to admit when you feel weak. I think especially with how males are viewed in certain cultures. The mistake I think people make is thinking vulnerability is the opposite of bravery and strength. I believe the willingness to be vulnerable is bravery and strength. It‚Äôs also so important for healing. Brene Brown talks about this a bunch and I find her stuff so helpful. You are brave to share your feelings of weakness. I admire you for that."
Anxiety,erdv6y6,t1_erduvjh,1560759364.0,I really hope so too. I think if each person with anxiety can validate and support others suffering with anxiety that would be an awesome start. We aren‚Äôt going to do it perfectly. That‚Äôs ok. I think it takes practice to do. Anything worth doing does.
ptsd,erdkmeh,t1_erdkfq2,1560745329.0,You are so welcome. I‚Äôm so glad it has helped. I know it something I have to keep in mind for myself too!
happy,erbbvyd,t3_c14am1,1560671237.0,I‚Äôm so happy to hear you are being kind to yourself. You deserve love and kindness. Sometimes one of the hardest things to give ourselves. You‚Äôre awesome!
Anxiety,erbbgf6,t3_c10zpe,1560670577.0,"No dumb problems. All problems are valid and deserving of compassion, empathy and support."
ptsd,eqsi6ho,t1_eqqxv9m,1560285456.0,You‚Äôre so welcome. I know this is something I need to hear. So easy to invalidate our own trauma and recovery
Anxiety,eq7uars,t1_eq7tl6r,1559853354.0,You are so welcome! I‚Äôm so glad. If you had been the only one to see this it would have been totally worth putting out there. I‚Äôd had a hard time with another post and was wondering if I should keep posting. I‚Äôm so glad I did. Hang in there. You got this. I know it doesn‚Äôt feel like that sometimes. If you are having another hard day. Feel free to message me. Been through some dark days myself.
Anxiety,eq7t49y,t1_eq7eedp,1559852774.0,Know the feeling. It‚Äôs hard to hold onto our value in a world that wants to reduce us done to our productivity. I try to think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a human being not a human doing.‚Äù I‚Äôm glad this found you!
Anxiety,eq7sv0b,t1_eq6uwhf,1559852644.0,"Remembering our value doesn‚Äôt come from what we do does seem to free us up to focus on what we need to heal and get better. I think we need to remember our value to prioritize ourselves. By the way I think that can be the most productive use of time. I think you are brave and courageous for doing this. Going to therapy is a challenging, vulnerable thing. I think a lot of people hear would agree what your doing is important."
ptsd,eq7s7s9,t1_eq5qvfi,1559852323.0,"I think it‚Äôs understandable to have that hope. It sounds healthy to let go of it now with what has happened. However there are other people, more healthy people out there who can admit when they are wrong. I have learnt to surround myself with those sort of people."
Anxiety,eq5jhis,t1_eq5jfd8,1559803260.0,I‚Äôm glad I posted it then. I need this often myself. It‚Äôs so easy to forget our value or pin it onto our achievements.
Anxiety,eq5g4av,t1_eq5dh8y,1559800056.0,You are so brave. It is hard getting exposure to our fears. I find it easier to do these things if I start with acknowledging my worth. You are good enough regardless of whether you face your fears or not. Don‚Äôt underestimate how big this is for your recovery. Doesn‚Äôt change your value either way but big for recovery!
Anxiety,eq5fv8n,t1_eq59egd,1559799856.0,I‚Äôm so glad you were the brave person who wrote something first. You have done a lot of good for others here and it really touches my heart. Your awesome. Hang onto your worthiness. You got this!
Anxiety,eq5fljk,t1_eq5dba5,1559799673.0,Hang in there. You have a lot to offer even if your new boss can‚Äôt see that yet. Hold onto your intrinsic value.
Anxiety,eq5fhev,t1_eq5cnf6,1559799591.0,Totally agree. Others won‚Äôt always see your value. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not there. You are valuable and worthy. Hang in there!
Anxiety,eq5fcif,t1_eq5f78i,1559799501.0,"That‚Äôs amazing. I feel honored you shared this with me. I wish you all the best. It can be a challenging journey, so worth it though. You got this!"
ptsd,eq59g6j,t1_epytc2l,1559795632.0,"I‚Äôve spent some time thinking about what you said. I think ongoing abusive relationships and what I went through (a one off trauma that is now over) is different.

I think it‚Äôs huge that you are identifying and working through this. It sounds very important to your journey and your ongoing wellbeing. I‚Äôm sorry if what I said communicated that what you were doing isn‚Äôt valid or necessary. It clearly is. 

I think I over simplified. I did process my original trauma. I had to see my own part in it. I‚Äôm now at the stage where I need to accept it and move on. So what I said was helpful for me and clearly unhelpful for you. 

Thank you for sharing this with me. I can imagine it wasn‚Äôt easy. It helped me to rethink what I said and re-examine it. I appreciate that."
Anxiety,eq58snd,t3_bxccsq,1559795232.0,It‚Äôs really vulnerable to be in the middle of happy times. It‚Äôs hard to allow yourself to enjoy them. To be grateful rather than fearful. To let the walls down and open yourself up for the possibility of being hurt. I don‚Äôt think we have happiness and joy without that vulnerability. I‚Äôm working on leaning into that vulnerability myself. Letting others be a part of my life even though I can‚Äôt know if they will always stick around. Letting myself desire and want. It‚Äôs uncomfortable to be vulnerable. It‚Äôs important thought. I learnt that from Brene Brown. She has some good stuff to say on this.
Anxiety,eq56m8v,t3_bxc6zk,1559793908.0,One last thing. You are enough even if you don‚Äôt get upvotes when you post. Even if you post something and someone else disagrees or says something hurtful. It doesn‚Äôt change your value. You are enough.
