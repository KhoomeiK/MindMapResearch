Even though I had some kind of picture in my head as what I would see, it was not enough preparation.
I can say it scarred me for life and made me feel some type of way about humanity, knowing theres actually people like that in this world.

I started becoming more introverted, I honestly didnt trust anybody, even while walking outside, I would look at people and be like ""Does he look like he could be one of them?""

Its a very eerie experience, and it can stick to you your whole life."

As an atheist myself, I must admit that having multiple gods is much more creative than one who does everything.

Another thing is that much of these gods, even though there were multiple, they more or less represented a personality of one god, mostly seen in hinduism."

Ive been thinking of getting into astrophography and space exploration in general, Im interested  buying a telescope and perhaps a dslr.

Is there any beginner tips you could give me in terms of which telescopes are good for beginners and what to look for when buying?

And is it complicated when you first start off?

Beatiful picture btw,keep em coming."
