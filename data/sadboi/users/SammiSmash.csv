Red. Flag.

As a woman, regardless of previous trust issues that may exist, this is to the point of over the top.  Every person is allowed to have friends of the opposite sex. Most of mine are male, MANY are and have always been strictly platonic. 

If you were still friends with your ex, sure - I'd be concerned.  But if she's getting that worked up over strictly platonic friendships with the opposite sex to the point of demanding to read texts I'd think there are more underlying issues at hand. Has she MET any of these women that you are friends with? Would that potentially ease her anxiety about them? Knowing them and meeting them and their partners (if they exist) to see that it is only platonic. 

Have you talked to her about WHY she feels this way? If you're wanting to keep her as a girlfriend, there has to be a point of compromise. And it being that you are NOT required to give up friends for her, because that should not happen. Ever."

When I was with my BF, we'd have sex basically every other day. At the beginning was everyday, but we decided too much as we have fairly lengthy sessions. We are no longer together, however, we have still maintained almost the same schedule, a) because it was mutually decided to end things, and b) because the sex is amazing, so around every 2-4 days. Kind of our agreement until one of us finds another, or starts sleeping with another."

AskRedditAfterDark,fgsctjd,t1_fgs9xcx,1581080675.0,"Honestly, if I'm on an r4r, I just search by my city, see who's posted and check out their profiles for photos. NSFW are usually a good sign if you're looking for something fun.. just reply to the post and see what happens.  OR, post your own and see what happens.  Wont know until you try!"
AskRedditAfterDark,fgscpg0,t3_ez74kq,1581080573.0,"I 100% have a type, and even when I'm dating online, I pick the types that I like based on looks. Online dating has made us shallow.. 

Being tall, and slender \[5'9 & 135lbs\] I tend to attract all types, but given that, anyone I'm not into I will flat out explain why.  May seem harsh, btu honesty is better than anything.

My preference however is over 6'0 generally, though I do *sometimes* make exceptions, athletic to lanky with med/dark hair. No beards and no bald (like, to the skin Bic'd) heads. 

However, I do notice a pattern of Fuckbois that match with me.. LOL"
AskRedditAfterDark,fgs9lfe,t3_eys9dn,1581077597.0,"Yep! I had posted on an r4r for my city, and then messages happened, and numbers were exchanged. Invited him over.. Still not sure if he told me his name or not.. Oh well. It was good."
