What’re your sources for the lockdown not helping? This is basically a partisan stance that they are important.

I’m 100% open to discussion about if our measures are hurting more than helping. And in all honesty I have a small family with no older folks, mostly younger friends, the Coronavirus (selfishly) is not a concern to me. If anything I’d like to buy a house in the next couple years so the timing could work out great if a ton of Americans drop.

I agree that we need to be careful about who we choose as martyrs. But also this only became a story when the video was released. If these two guys were arrested and awaited trial or bond (like most people suspected of a crime, much less one that involves the loss of life..) this would not have been a national story. The process needs to apply to everyone and not make exceptions for people with previous police ties ect.   


Anyways, I think we should all agree more clarification needs to happen on citizens arrest and we need to prevent cases like this and Trayvon Martin from ever happening again. There is no reason that citizens should be arming themselves and trying to apprehend suspects off of their own property. Do you think these laws should be changed or clarified?"

AskTrumpSupporters,fqauru6,t1_fq92wa1,1589225636.0,"interesting. I have also become increasingly more critical of liberalism during Trump's tenure but I find myself on the other end. I find myself constantly annoyed by the gotchas and think pieces that hit the top of r/politics. Everyone is more concerned with optics than actually helping americans.   


In a lot of ways I agree with you, but those same criticisms I'd lobby at the right as well. I would go on TD for the same reason I go on here. To familiarize myself with opposing views. I was banned from T\_D because of a comment I made. There was a post that essentially boiled down to ""liberal women are fat and ugly"" which like, I get it, it's hard to find people attractive when you disagree with them, (as well as conservatives/liberals just having different aesthetic prefs) but I then pointed out red states/conservatives were actually more likely to be fat, with sources, and was banned. In the same way r/politics is an echo chamber, TD, r/conservatives, ect ect all are as well. There are so few good faith places for discussion and I'd argue that while this subreddit tries, it often fails and just parrots r/politics headlines that I know TSers won't give a shit about.   


The unfortunate thing is most people don't get involved locally and we posture online and lose sight of the fact we often have more in common with folks in our community than things that are different. I'd love for a viable third party to emerge that focuses on working class (I think the left and right agree on low/middle classes being squeezed right now) and how we unify to collectively bargain for better wages, access to healthcare, ect.  


One last anecdote and something that helped me understand TS was my friend (leftist/socialist) went to a trump rally in st. louis early in his campaign before he had any traction. My friend asked me what I thought the most repeated words/things were in his speech. I said ""lock her up"", ""emails"", ect.   


My friend quickly corrected me and said ""Love"". Trump was preaching a message of love and energy that really resonated with these folks. Then as soon as they left the stadium they were confronted with leftists calling them racists ect and things escalated. I truly believe the powers in the left and the right have a vested interest in keeping us divided.  I'm tired of left/right conversations and want class consciousness conversations.   


Anyways sorry for the long rant, but I absolutely get where you're coming from and hope that one day we can have more conversations about our common struggles. I have mostly liberal friends and the ""Drumpf bad"" sentiments are boring as hell. Do you wish there was more bipartisanship in this country?"

vegan,fh8euhb,t1_fh7yr1w,1581358243.0,I understand it's usefulness as an umbrella term and use it myself that way. But I think i'd personally be weary of normalizing it's use especially by straight people. I grew up with queer being used as a slur and having straight folks throw it around makes me wanna vom.
vegan,fh8ejs1,t1_fh7nt1k,1581358064.0,"Not for everyone. As a bi male I honestly loathe being called queer especially if it's from a straight person.  


The rule of thumb is if you don't know how someone IDs it's not a word you would use for them. It's used as an umbrella term because there isn't anything besides long acronyms that have been deemed inclusive enough."
hiphopheads,fh8b9so,t1_fh88a13,1581356062.0,"no, because billie did not include herself in that statement. She punched down a genre she's taken so much from. I'm honestly disappointed but not surprised by her words We've seen it time and time again from pop stars.   


Example: We as artists often construe and exaggerated image. > fine statement  


Billie: rappers talk about guns and bitches ahahah what guns and bitches??? > ignorant statement. It's dumb and hypocritical and a literal boomer take."
hiphopheads,fh7ckbj,t1_fh7cg4r,1581324775.0,"Yeah I mean, some think pieces will get dropped and it will be off the news cycle in less than a week. As much as cancel culture is talked about, people who are widely liked aren’t going to be phased. Louis CK could drop a Netflix special tomorrow and he’d make a shit ton of money if it was any good.

What I’m getting at is that it’s not a big deal if Billie gets called out for a dumb take. We should be open to criticism."
hiphopheads,fh7asuy,t1_fh7a7s2,1581322306.0,I don’t. I don’t make sweeping statements on black culture and I definitely don’t preach respectability politics in hip hop. I enjoy the music and even that comes with the understanding that I’m an outsider and won’t ever fully grasp the complexities of black art.
hiphopheads,fh79nim,t1_fh77g23,1581320792.0,"Liking rap, especially older rap, is not indicative of your ability to understand rap culture. You can listen to ATCQ and still show your ass. Bhad babie works with actual rappers too, is she exempt from being a fucking joke too?"
hiphopheads,fh73t60,t1_fh71brr,1581314130.0,It’s a stupid surface level observation that offers no insight. Like a literal rap is crap middle school take. She should get dunked on for taking parts of black culture that she thinks is cool and then shitting on that same culture that she has no understanding of.
hiphopheads,fh1s08q,t1_fh01k3p,1581222485.0,Hi bich
phish,fgpy2zk,t1_fgpgddk,1581014211.0,I agree with all of that - I did already outline why my dept chose to unblock it. We’d rather have people looking at their computers and not their phones. We haven’t seen FB as an attack vector for our company. The risk was balanced vs having people checking their phones. I agree that if I was dealing with that amount of money or sensitive data I would go that route but that’s not the reality of our environment.
phish,fgpeq45,t1_fgosih7,1581003315.0,Soo the same risk as people using their email? Infected/phishing links are everywhere. We can reduce the amount of them but not eliminate them. If your users are clicking random links on Facebook they’d probably do the same for their work email. That’s a user education issue.
phish,fgnwpn8,t1_fgmwbrz,1580954553.0,what are the security risks to your internal network associated with someone logging into FB or Reddit and browsing the site?
phish,fgmtsx0,t1_fgmhy8c,1580931908.0,"Feel that. If that were the the type of org I worked for I would make it happen, but we found users would just use their phones so we stopped blocking Facebook. If you’re not doing your job a manager might ask us to check out something but otherwise the company recognizes that not every minute of the day needs to be productive and that most folks can manage light browsing while doing what they need to."
phish,fgmhsld,t1_fgmcuqz,1580924834.0,Any good IT department isn’t micromanaging end users. We have better things to do than look at who is browsing Facebook and Reddit. (Obviously though if the request comes down to look into it we have to)
