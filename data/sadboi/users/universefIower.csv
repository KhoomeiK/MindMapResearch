I often get completely ignored by my family when I'm talking too so it just becomes like talking to a brick wall. 

I've been called spoiled and bratty constantly pretty much my entire childhood so confiding any problems instantly makes me starts thinking they aren't valid because Nmom made me believe I am.  

I just deal with it by not sharing any personal problems with her anymore and isolating myself however much I can although its very difficult since I still have to live with her."

Main: 6-15 A/S: Chapter 3 for JK, JM, Tae, Jin, Joon and Yoongi. Haven't started for Hobi yet..but it's because I was hoping to get better cards for him first. ;v; (I think I'll make it for his first 2 chapters now that I have 2 4s of him, but I'll need an upgraded and/or maxed out 3 for chapter 3..probably.) 

**Number of cards collected:** 162 (I have to clean up alot of unnecessary 2*s and 1*s HOOO BOI)

**Card levels:** 2 5* max level, 1 5* unmaxed, 22 4* w/ 14 at max level!

**Group stats:**

- Empathy: 14

- Passion: 14

- Stamina: 14

- Wisdom: 14

**Photo album:** 94ers Set: 80% complete..Just need duplicates of Confused, Confession and Only the Best Days Ahead for the 1st set.
The rest are still pretty incomplete..
For Roundy and Little Puppy Set I managed to get a duplicate of Shocking Visual and just rolled Taekwon Boy today so hopefully I can get a duplicate of him one day. Dang..Really struggling to get those 3*s though. ;v; 


**How much have you spent?:** 43$ I was going to be strictly f2p and not spend a single dime but the Summer event broke that :"") (thanks). I put alot of effort in it and was nearly at the 45k mark, but wouldn't have made it in time without spending so I figured what the hell. But I felt very dirty and pathetic about it afterwards. rip"

I'm finding it cruel because of how many memories we have from that house and how it's practically like a childhood home to us, like her's is with my grandparents' house. It would hurt to see it so heartlessly get rid of. 

My brother used to be very emotionally attached to it as well, and was against selling it, but now he doesn't care either. I actually have somewhat mixed feelings in some ways. It feels like a ""cursed"" house when you consider how many things have broken in it over the years and how many other bad things have happened. But I'm shocked all the good times we spent there wouldn't mean anything to them now."

Wow, why should she care about your own money like that first of all? (Unless she's just interested in it herself, lol.)

Assuming every other person will be as shallow as them, such as choosing whether or not to date someone based on the car they own..That's just sad but not suprising."
raisedbynarcissists,eongg63,t3_bsbjlu,1558711902.0,"Definitely. My mother has mocked the fact that I'm still into Japanese things like manga and anime, saying things like ""You're still into those animations? Aren't you too old for that?"". Same with Japanese movies..She refuses to watch a single movie I recommend to her if it's Asian. (But this is a very racist/white nationalist Nmom we're talking about that just recently told me to stop applying to jobs on the right side of the street, and to apply for the left one instead because ""there's more white people there"". She's also complained we're the only white people there when I went with her somewhere once...) 

She's always tried to instill more feminine interests in me, but I never cared because I've always been more naturally tomboyish.  She would call me a slob and that I'm like a guy, just because I have had no interest in girly things like doing my hair or nails, makeup, etc. I think I am starting to feel a little bit more interest in some of them, like makeup, but I'm scared I'll just be living through my mom if I do them..because she told me things like ""No guy will like you"" if I don't. 

Since 6th grade, I've liked to write but she never seemed to care other than passively commenting things like ""I know, you're a great writer"", ""You have a gift for writing"", etc. without sparing a glance when I wrote something for her. It was more something she just wanted to show off to other people on her Facebook wall. Yet she would always send me links of articles and videos of other authors who had gotten published, like she's once again comparing me to other people and rubbing it in my face. For a woman who has supposedly read so much in her lifetime and cares so much about the work of other writers,  she pretty much gives no shit about the writing of her own daughter (Who has, not to boast but, been praised and noticed for my writing skills by multiple teachers and even had a piece get district-wide acknowledgement once when I was in middle school.) 

I've realized my mother has just always wanted me to be an extension of herself, not for me to have my own individuality. She would only accept me if I was like her clone. 

It's sad that Ns feel the need to enforce stereotypically masculine or feminine interests in their children though..So what if a boy is into fashion? So what if a girl is into comic books?"
