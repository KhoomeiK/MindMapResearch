depression,fpeudxp,t3_gczi8c,1588555141.0," what I have learnt from depression 

1.  you are never alone even when you feel like it 
2.  having depression doesn't make you broken, useless or worthless / having depression means you have more hurtles in life than most
3. depression does not care how rich / poor or what gender you are etc. It come's to try take every part of your life 
4. text book knowledge can only help you so much. each person is different  some can see a health professional  other's anti depressants etc
5.  social media is beyond toxic  we spend to much time comparing our lives to others that it hinders us and make's us  more depressed and constantly questioning  life 
6. admitting you need help does not make you weak. it make's you stronger. 
7. eating a healthy balanced diet is important and avoiding junk food is important as it contains things that kills something in our body that makes us happy
8. never treat  other's like they don't know what your feeling"

depression,fowe0eq,t3_g9ua1j,1588117948.0,Hey I am sorry your dad is  in hospital  It must be scary.   people can be cruel and those people don't deserve your time. I know how it feels to be hurt . it's why I don't have in real friends . that and the fact I  have anxiety  making friends . being human  can be a tough thing.  but be a better human being than those people
depression,fowd78m,t1_fowcvx0,1588117510.0,"Yeh I posted some stuff on the forum a few minute's ago and one I wrote with a friend who's struggling , writing songs or just writing can be an outlet"
depression,fowd12a,t3_g9vvkj,1588117415.0, there is always something to live for. it's just depression is a darkened cloud that always hangs above you and clouds your view  and make's any thought of Joy fade  and people tell you not to give up because  you shouldn't  and it's hard to not give up when it feels like the whole world's against you. trust me the world can suck .Take each day one day at a time . And when it come's to college did you loose interest or passion in what your studying?
depression,fowbt34,t1_fowbf5c,1588116751.0," that's life  we find it hard to believe things will get better. and people saying it  will get better can be damaging. getting better is about getting help, support  and working towards things we want in life .  but at the same time it take's  hard work and the first step is always going to be the hardest"

depression,fow8jf8,t3_g9r9zh,1588114992.0," Sounds like she's in denial . parent's don't want their kids to go through  Hell  and want to believe their kids are healthy and happy.  some parent's don't know how to deal with it .I am so sorry that you had to deal with that . depression can bite at any age . I was 10 when it bit me  due to an accident which destroyed  Not only the life's of the young boy who lost his life but everyone involved .And yes I did go to councilors although they did a lot of damage trying to get me to sue my parents ( Aggressively ) I screamed at them ""I don't want to f....kn sue my parents ""they Just kept saying but you can.. I left in tears . So I kept quiet  Didn't get help didn't tell my mother or father or anything . It took me 12 years to admit I need help and when I did my whole family were trapped under this cloud of depression. it make's me mad and sad when people deny that someone is struggling with depression because of age , religion  or  finical status . Depression doesn't care  about anything  like that. I hope you get the help you need ."

depression,fow4iuy,t1_fow0s21,1588112870.0," for me it's what I do daily I have always love helping people but all the hardship taught me to be tough and not let people take advantage of that kindness. but I will never stop reaching out to other's because each life matters . were all intertwined in the crazy thing we call life . and each person you help  could mean life or  death for someone's sibling, child or  friend etc ."

depression,fouh45m,t3_g9h952,1588083961.0,Hey I am so sorry you had to go through that at such a young age . I lost my mother 6 years ago  my brother was about your age at the time  and I have other siblings too. but just know your father wouldn't want his pain and him ending his life to take yours's too. I will tell you. there will be time's you just want to cry other's you will get mad thats normal to go through grief . Losing my mother I cried  a lot and felt numb  for day's it felt un real . I'd suggest you talk to psychologist. Also remember all the good time's you had. Maybe one day you will be a father your self  and you will have good memory's with your son or daughter . I also feel the same with my mother I was mad at her that night  because I was sick and I gave her money for soup and she brought coke instead =(

depression,fouasne,t1_fou7fwb,1588080320.0,"I took everything day by day . My depression started when I was 10  I was in the car that hit and killed a young boy who was 11-13 years old at the time . I saw him die and when I was tossed into counselling they  aggressively tried to get me to sue my parents . because of them I  had trust issues and didn't talk to anyone . I'd smile around people and cry into pillows' I faced almost dying in fire's  and my mother's mental state went down hill from the accident . we faced finical stress due to my mother hiding bills she didn't pay ( a voice told me to clean my parents room which is how I found the bills) I  remember now going to places you pay bills to talk about things and holding my dad at 10 telling him we will be ok we will get through this.  I think my faith and my family  are two factors as to why I am still alive .  but now I also live also because I know the Live's ive impacted. and it all started because a gaming friend reached out when I  3 day No sleep  gamed . and He was in a bad place I spent 7-8 hours supporting him . some may feel a burden to others  but to other's  people  are someone's brother, mother, father, sister , cousin friend etc. I hope you can come through this tough time"
