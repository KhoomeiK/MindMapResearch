I was on a trip with class and got out of the bus to go to the bathroom and such. On that trip I had these wireless headphones that go around your neck (OnePlus Bullets) and they're in-ear type. After I went outside I noticed that the eartip from the left ""speaker"" was missing and was a bit worried that I wouldn't find it. The rest of the day went without it, but in the evening we went to the hotel and headed to our rooms. I went to mine, got undressed and there it is laying on the ground behind me (not someone else's)

Probably easily explainable but at that time I was confused and happy I found it."
