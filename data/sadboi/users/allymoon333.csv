I think it bothers me more than it does him. I'm just tired of constantly being on edge, and not being able to watch a good majority of all the movies and series that are popular lol"

I occasionally leave out red wine and dark chocolate, and I have done a couple new moon rituals for her. And I would need to do some more research before I worked with the Qliphoth because i don't know much right now lol"
realwitchcraft,fpqe2yb,t1_fpqd549,1588820723.0,"I've done research, but I've never really worked with Odin. I've been trying to work with Lilith for a while because I love what she stands for, and she basically screams self confidence lol. I call out to her while I meditate and I leave her offerings, but I've only felt her once. Maybe she didn't feel drawn to me  or something? Maybe it's time to try calling to someone else. 

Thanks :)"
Anxiety,flc2nsf,t3_fkq88w,1585018370.0,"YES YES YES. My boyfriend and I closed on a house in MS literally 3 days before all this started to happen. Perfect timing right? 
I'm a hairstylist, so 5 days ago the owner of my salon decided to close shop for at least 2 weeks, if not longer. I'm stuck in my house all day just freaking the fuck out because I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills. And on top of that, we haven't even been able to get the bare essentials grocery wise because everyone is hoarding EVERYTHING. This is the first time we've been on our own so we literally have nothing and I'm FREAKING OUT."

witchcraft,fih03k5,t3_f7wzqd,1582405096.0,"It honestly doesn't bother me. That might have something to do with me being into that certain style before I even began to practice though. I don't really like that it portrays all witches to be these evil, satanic beings, but people come to that conclusion on their own no matter what you wear. 
I'm a firm believer in letting people wear whatever they want though, even if it's just because it's in style or they look cool and edgy or whatever. 

So yeah, I don't mind it, but I guess I could see how it can offend some people."

writers,figaka0,t3_f7w0dg,1582397657.0,"I feel like you could go about it a different way. Maybe, instead of pausing to look at her before the action, describe her during the action. If she's been through the things you've mentioned, I'm sure she wouldn't want a man to dissect every flaw with his eyes before they get intimate. So maybe during foreplay, you could describe how the stretch marks and scars feel beneath his fingertips(or lips, depending on how steamy you want to get). Instead of making her sound broken, try to use her imperfections as ways to make her appear stronger in the man's eyes. She's very strong to go through all that and still be willing to be vulnerable in front of a man. Make him realize that, it'll form a deeper bond between the two."

realwitchcraft,fi1jaj3,t3_f5xsdl,1582058861.0,"I second the podcasts 100% and youtube! It's difficult for me to stay focused when reading because I have ADHD lol, so podcasts and youtube taught me A LOT. BS-Free witchcraft and witch bitch amateur hour are my favorite spotify podcasts. 

Some more advice that I wish I had when I first started: ALWAYS second guess others' opinions and go with your gut. There will be people that try to tell you their way is the only way - stay away from them. Witchcraft is called a PRACTICE for a reason, there's no wrong way to do it. Sometimes it's trial and error. Just find out what feels right to you, and go for it!"
witchcraft,fhzch7j,t1_fhzbg83,1581995991.0,"That would be a good start! I talked to my boyfriend about crystals a lot in the beginning because I always have at least one on me, so I would always tell them what they were for and all that. That kinda got him interested because he thought they were cool lmao so I just went from there. So maybe just tell him stuff about your craft that he would find cool or interesting, that way he'll be curious about learning more!"
witchcraft,fhycozr,t3_f5b59d,1581973242.0,"My advice is to wait until he comes to you saying he wants to be involved. My boyfriend has known I was a witch since we first got together and he's Christian. He asked a couple questions here and there, but he didn't really think much of it. He has a whatever attitude about most things though haha. It took him a whole year, but he finally came to me and said he wanted to try a spell with me. So keep informing him about stuff(I wouldn't start with anything that might make him back off though obviously) and just show him how passionate you are about it. I'm sure he'll come around and become curious before long. Good lucküñ§"
