I dont think i will ever  confess and tell her because i dont have the courage yet and afraid that i will scare the shit out of her but even if i try and she said yes thing will not go anywhere because i'm too fucked up right now! Fuck my life, I have never had a crush on a girl this big and the thinking in my head is just killing me. It's so hard to get over like i used to."
