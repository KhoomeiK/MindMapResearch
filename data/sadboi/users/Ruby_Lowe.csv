depression,fqxgdqo,t3_gl8he5,1589731881.0,"I have been thinking about that for a long time. I came to the realization that it wouldn't make a difference whether I went back in past or not. Just like how if I redid a course or subject I still wouldn't understand it as well nor have the motivation to study diligently through out the term/semester, the same is with life. 10 years ago I still would have been depressed, 10 years ago I still would have been bullied both inside my house and at school. There are certain embarrassing moments I might have been able to curb but the core problems would still remain. That is because to this day I haven't learned to maturely and correctly handle these problems. Also, I am slowly learning to handle them because of situations I have been put in recently like in the past two years. The people who I needed to protect me 10 years ago didn't, the people who protect me and help me grow into a better person are here now. I don't want to give that up to fix minor mistakes in the past or in the hopes that I deal with being bullied better. Truth is I am more powerful now than I was then despite still battling with depression."

Christian,fq9svzt,t1_fq9if6r,1589206365.0,"We can carefully pick our partners. We need to make it a matter of prayer. We also need to look in the bible for qualities that make a good wife (Proverbs) or husband (Accounts of husband and wife in the bible). Then we compare those actions to the person whom we are dating. I understand what you are saying. People can be manipulative and if we become infatuated with them then it may be hard to see their bad qualities. Infatuation comes from vulnerability and insecurities. It isn't love but obsession with the other person so we are so comfortable that we do not want to be away from them. Given that, someone who loves blindly when they become infatuated is immature spiritually because they arent using God's words to reason but relying on their own understanding and emotions. Additionally, if someone keeps apologising for things you think they should know better on then they are also spiritually immature and I read some where that ""Apology without change is manipulation."" Remember that. If you are so easily manipulated then may be you need to look within yourself and see if there is anything about you you need to change so that people dont manipulate you easily. I had to work on it too. Dont worry. You can do this.

I touched on your last question in a comment in this post about becoming Christian after marriage.

""Well, having both in submission is pleasing to God. That is ideal but some people come to love and know God after being married to an unbelieving husband. The bible also touches on that. 1 Cor 7: 13-14 **and** **if** **a** **woman** **has** **an** **unbelieving** **husband** **and** **he** **is** **agreeable** **to** **staying** **with** **her,** **let** **her** **not** **leave** **her** **husband. 14. For** **the** **unbelieving** **husband** **is** **sanctified** **in** **relation** **to** **his** **wife,** **and** **the** **unbelieving** **wife** **is** **sanctified** **in** **relation** **to** **the** **brother;** **otherwise,** **your** **children** **would** **be** **unclean,** **but** **now** **they** **are** **holy.**

Also, another scripture speaks about how to act in this case:

1 Peter 3: 1 & 2 - In the same way, you wives, be in subjection to your husbands, so that if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives, because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct together with deep respect."""
Christian,fq8vi1z,t3_ghg3ua,1589176723.0,"Well, you believe in God and Jesus and so does Satan and his demons. Believing doesn't automatically make you a True Christian. 1 John 5: 3 **For** **this** **is** **what** **the** **love** **of** **God** **means,** **that** **we** **observe** **his** **commandments; and** **yet** **his** **commandments** **are** **not** **burdensome.** 

Based on this scripture, real love for God means observing his commandments. To observe his commandments in this context means to obey. That means doing what he asks. John 14:23 **In** **answer** **Jesus** **said** **to** **him:** **“If** **anyone** **loves** **me,** **he** **will** **observe** **my** **word, and** **my** **Father** **will** **love** **him,** **and** **we** **will** **come** **to** **him** **and** **make** **our** **dwelling** **with** **him.**

This scripture means we must do everything Jesus asked us to do while on earth. This is why learning the gospel is imperative. No one can go to the father except through the son. We need to understand Jesus in order to know and develop a personal relationship with the father. 

If you don't feel guilty, it is good that you are so self aware and can acknowledge when you feel bad and when you don't and be truthful about it. That is a great quality. Since you know that you don't feel bad or kind of feel bad about something that you think God may hate then follow these steps:

1. Find scriptures that may help you understand if he hates it or not. Find God's full view on the matter. This may involve looking at various scriptures based on the topic

For example:

Colossians 3:8

**But** **now** **you** **must** **put** **them** **all** **away** **from** **you:** **wrath,** **anger,** **badness, abusive** **speech,** **and** **obscene** **talk out** **of** **your** **mouth.** 

N.B Colossian chapter 3 seems like a good read for you if you have the time. 

2. Find out why he hates it. 

For example

**Ephesians 4: 30** 

**Also,** **do** **not** **be** **grieving** **God’s** **holy** **spirit, with** **which** **you** **have** **been** **sealed** **for** **a** **day** **of** **releasing** **by** **ransom.**

If you read the full context of the chapter you will understand that it said that rotten words grieve God's holy spirit; it hurts God basically. 

3. After understanding why it is bad, pray for the strength and courage to stop doing it and apologise for doing it. N.B. God may be loving and forgiving but he is definitely not an idiot so if you ask for forgiveness about something you don't feel sorry for, he knows. If you want to pray for help understanding why you should feel sorry for your actions then by all means go ahead. 

4. Then work on putting practical measures in place to stop. 

Used to curse, I had to unfollow the social media that had a lot of cursing and I also had to tell my friends not to curse in front of me. It was hard confronting my friends you really need courage for that so I advise you pray for the courage."
Christian,fq8s51l,t3_gh9ykd,1589173989.0,"Honestly, the way how this paragraph was written sounds so biased like you aren't looking at the situation objectively but you have a victim mentality and are trying to make everyone else seem like the enemy. It also shows how insecure you are. It is alright we all have insecurities. The bible gives great advice on what a true friend is. I will add the scriptures at the end. Also, maybe they aren't the problem; you are. You crave attention from people who don't seem to give you the kind you want nor are interested in the same things you want to talk about. Maybe, you give too much of yourself (time and energy) to people who expect to take it without giving anything in return. Those aren't true friends. Also, you sound really judgmental and entitled. Look within yourself and make sure you are a good friend and then you will attract good friends. Also, quality over quantity. If you lost friends one by one maybe they weren't good for you. I hate that people are in the comments saying that maybe they aren't true Christians because you said you don't like how they treat you. If they really are your friends you would call them out on it individually and tell them how you feel. You said it yourself that they only treat you like that so maybe the problem is your insecurities or your unrealistic expectations of them. If you cant see confronting them going well so you hesitate then you become the problem because you see the problem yet you dont try to fix it. You just put up with it in hopes that it would go away. That isnt being a true friend.

Please don't be quick to offense when reading but really examine what I said so you can see for yourself the real reason why they treated you like that. Scriptures:

Probs 17: 17

**A** **true** **friend** **shows** **love** **at** **all** **times**

**And** **is** **a** **brother** **who** **is** **born** **for** **times** **of** **distress**

Provs 18: 24

**here** **are** **companions** **ready** **to** **crush** **one** **another,**

**But** **there** **is** **a** **friend** **who** **sticks** **closer** **than** **a** **brother**

The bible says at Hebrews 3:4  ""Of course, every house is constructed by someone, but the one who constructed all things is God."" 

Now as Christians we take the bible as law so those words in the bible first and foremost prove that he created us among others mentioned that point to him creating the earth and humans. 

However, that only answers the question in a spiritual since. People usually doubt his existence based on practical reasoning such as the theory of Evolution. So you have to tell me specifically what reasons people have given you for believing that God does not exists so that you and I can reason on it using practical evidence as well as the bible. 

Do you have any examples?"
Christian,fq8cykl,t3_gh9sw9,1589163389.0,"The bible doesn't specifically say curse words. It says abusive speech. Something such as calling someone Stupid, idiot, moron...hurtful words like those are included. Keep that in mind. The main bad words you are talking about are like swear words that time to be universally bad. You know what I mean. If you think it isn't kind even if it is used an expression, don't use it. All abusive speech is unkind and makes God disappointed when we use it,"
Christian,fq8chc7,t3_ggvpm0,1589163084.0,"You must remember that as a Christian, your aim is to align yourself with God's purpose for mankind. That involves observing his word the bible. God loves all of us, yes. However, especially in the letters to the congregations written in the bible (1 Cor, 2 Cor, etc) it constantly warned us to be on guard against bad associations. Proverbs 13: 20 **The one walking with the wise will become wise, But the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.**

God constantly warned that bad associations could be our undoing. He even considered some people in the congregation to be people not to associate with. You could read 1 Cor to understand what I mean. An extract of it says: 

1 Cor 5:6 -8  -  Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough? 7  Clear away the old leaven so that you may be a new batch, inasmuch as you are free from ferment. For, indeed, Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed. 8 So, then, let us keep the festival, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of badness and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 

Paul acknowledged that having bad associations could affect our spirituality too. He not only warned about the detriment of hanging around non believers but about hanging around people in the congregation who had unchristian like traits. He feared they would rub off on the rest of the congregation, hence the little leaven fermenting the whole batch of dough. That letter was to warn everyone in the congregation meaning no one was immune to the detriment it would bring if they continued hanging around those people. 

I am not saying that you should break up with him or anything like that. That is your decision, but discern for yourself if what you are doing is something that benefits you or if it is something that God would be proud of. God wants everyone on earth to be saved but he has standards and a method we must follow to do that. 

I am saying this because I have been there, falling for someone who was unbelieving and thinking that I can get him to love God and make him someone God would want me to marry. It took too much out of me spiritually, mentally and emotionally."

If you got hit, you would have been in the wrong for not being careful, well that is the case where I am from. If you had actually got into an accident and the person speeding died then you would have blood guilt on your hands. So please always be careful."

Christian,fq87f3p,t3_ghbgf6,1589160022.0,"I guess this is why choosing the right marriage mate is important. We need to search out their true personality to see if they are someone who will treat us well. Even if we do that, sometimes  people and circumstances change and that may make the husband or wife hard to deal with. They may become extremely toxic and disrespectful. If they are emotionally abusive and of the opinion that their way is the best (cant stand a narcissist sigh) then you have to decide for yourself and for your children (if any) whether you can put measures in place to change your husband such as talking to him, taking him to counselling, speaking to a spiritual person in the congregation whom may get through to him or showing him scriptures that bring out the point that he should have respect for you. If that doesn't work then you may also have to decide to separate yourself from him for a while. Jesus when he was preaching said that marriage is sacred to God so no one should divorce except in the case of sexual immorality: 

Matthew 19: 3-9:

 And Pharisees came to him intent on testing him, and they asked: “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife on every sort of grounds?” 4 In reply he said: “Have you not read that the one who created them from the beginning made them male and female 5  and said: ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh’? 6 So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has yoked together, let no man put apart.” 7 They said to him: “Why, then, did Moses direct giving a certificate of dismissal and divorcing her?” 8  He said to them: “Out of regard for your hard-heartedness, Moses made the concession to you of divorcing your wives,but that has not been the case from the beginning. 9 I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on the grounds of sexual immorality, and marries another commits adultery.”

&#x200B;

Hence why I say separation rather than divorce. What I am trying to say is God treasures women very much. So to say that you must accept emotional abuse from a husband because that is God's request is disgusting. Try working on creating a more personal relationship with the father through examining his son Jesus Christ and other scriptures as well as other scriptures such as Psalms and Proverbs in order to understand what our God truly stands for."

However, look at the information objectively so that you don't scare  yourself into thinking you have something you don't. Websites such as PsychologyToday really helped me.

So constantly remembering that I am human and I am going to make mistakes and no one is perfect helps me to push through despite depression. Your life isnt a waste because of it. Some days will be hard and other even worse but your life is important with or without depression.
raisedbynarcissists,fp4xo05,t3_gaylb2,1588310148.0,"Don't compare your life to other's. You will always feel cheated whether emotionally or physically if you do. Your life was tough but don't dwell on it. It is what made you the person you are today. You know how to cook, you are independent and no doubt dependable. That is just the few I gathered from what you sent. Look at the positives that came out of it because dwelling on the negatives will force you to live in the past."
MaladaptiveDreaming,fp0ynmu,t1_foz2szn,1588219940.0,You are speaking about a completely different situation yet our reactions are the same. You described exactly what I do and how I feel. It feels great that you worded it so beautifully. You even added a solution to it. I need to figure out how to address my insecurities and whatever else that makes me obsessive.
depression,fowyeeh,t1_fow9y4v,1588129848.0,Very insightful. Thank you. I still dont know what to say to someone who is sending me a cry for help like that. I dont know how to help i guess.
MaladaptiveDreaming,fow1awm,t1_fovmjxo,1588111184.0,it doesnt help  mine. I find it makes it worse. My daydreams are a curse.
depression,fovk9dc,t1_fovjgtx,1588102738.0,I get what you are trying to say. You arent bad at explaining
depression,fovf5z6,t1_fovcb82,1588100281.0,Good. I believe you. What helped me in that regard is googling ways to set boundaries. There are also some therapists on instagram that post about different scenarios and how to set boundaries in those situations.
depression,fovbqyw,t1_fov6cjh,1588098666.0,"Yeah it is easy to feel that way. My sister would always only speak to me when she was extremely bored. Other than that she ignored me like I was nothing. It hurt because as my older sister I looked up to her. My life got better when I stopped seeking her attention. I didnt hate her but I didnt acknowledge as my sister either. She was someone who I live with and should get along with for the sake of everyone's sanity. I had to understand that her actions weren't because of me but it was a reflection of her. The more I reacted to it, the worse it got. When I stopped giving her the love attention she so desperately loved and always mishandled, she started treating me with more respect and being kinder. Classic narcissist. She was only doing it so i would go back to treating her like before. It never happened. However, i will say to you to not let their actions make you stop being kind. Dont stop caring about their problems and having an interest in it. Otherwise, you'd be just as bad as them. Wanting attention and love from them but not thinking they deserve it from you. Also, stop trying to use them to fill voids they cant. Look for new methods of filling the void of wanting your brother to hang with you."
depression,fov3amr,t3_g9qrox,1588094685.0,"This is so me. I went off on my sister the other day. She has always been a horrible person to me so it isn't that I was in the wrong for calling her out for what she did but I don't usually do it because I have more patience. I feel like my patience evaporated.....I miss it. I feel like I am spiraling out of control with rage, frustration and sadness."
depression,fov2kr2,t3_g9qxy3,1588094356.0,"Rather than living, you are existing. Your body is here but your mind isn't connected to it. Nothing excites you or brings you joy. Maybe that is why addictions are easy to slip into for people like me who feel empty. That burst of endorphins when taking substances or in my case sugar is the closest I can get to what I would suppose living is like."
depression,fov0z05,t3_g9kfwx,1588093614.0,"Honestly, I had a friend who hurt me really badly. I confronted her on it then tried to distance myself from her. Then a couple days after she asked me to meet her and we were talking and she started crying and showed me that she cut her wrists for what she did. She didn't really seem sorry for what she said just said that I got mad at her for it. I didnt actually get an apology either and she still continued to say remarks that made me feel like I was being belittle. However, I couldn't tell her anything because I was afraid she'd cut again. So I still feel like she did it for pity. So from that day on, I assume that people cut themselves for attention. If you do something wrong then put measures in place to fix it and make sure it never happens again. If you cut yourself for something and then continue cutting yourself every time you do it without actually changing then it doesn't change anything but the amount of scars on your body. You don't grow as a person. I find it is also manipulative. Apology without change is manipulation. However, maybe I am wrong. Please help me to view it in the correct light if that is the case."
depression,fouzfsq,t3_g9n2mc,1588092901.0,"I feel the same way. It has happened with many different friend groups too. Truth is maybe the people you are attracted to being friends with tend to be toxic however they are the only type of friends you know how to be comfortable with so you stick to them. I realized recently that because of my narcissistic sister who constantly abused me emotionally and my narcissistic dad who constantly lied to me, I am attracted to people who have narcissistic tendencies. So that is why I always had such awful friends. I also realized that sometimes I did have good friends but I too was toxic from being exposed to such toxic people so I would be a bad friend to them especially when my depression got severe. I have toxic tendencies which I have to constantly be on a look out for. It is even harder when you meet someone and they see your toxic nature and decide to leave. I understand that now because I met a friend who isn't afraid to identify my toxic traits and who is also willing to stay despite it (as long as I am working hard to fix it). That friend also makes me want to be a better person so I could be more deserving of their kindness. He isn't someone I thought I would ever be friends with in a million years because he isn't the usual friend I gravitate towards. So that is why I am telling you to try opening up your heart to other types of people. It will definitely be difficult finding and tolerating people outside of your comfort zone and the friendship may not even start off good. However, try. Also, please don't mix up opening up your heart for being a pushover. If someone is acting a way you don't like (toxic or bad), politely tell them you are uncomfortable. If they don't change then distance yourself from them in a polite way rather than compromise. Also, the situation you are currently dealing with with your group of friend is something I am currently going through. You can do one of two things, comfront them on the matter in a polite and genuine way or distance yourself from them politely and clear away any resentment you may have. There is one friend who I was closest to in my group that I want to confront and I also want to distance myself from all of them. Now I am trying really hard to clear the resentment. Know that their behaviour isn't something you can control but how you react and handle it is in your control. Sorry this is so long LOL"

depression,foseenf,t3_g92rsa,1588029087.0,Truth is I have people that love me dearly and I  still contemplate dying somethings. So whether you are someone who doesn't think you are loved and no one will you or whether you have people who love you the real problem stays which is the feeling of worthlessness. So try to fix that instead. Give yourself a purpose worth living for

AskWomen,foptlzv,t1_fopt4k2,1587971718.0,"I know being a lesbian is extra common but i still find that it is easier for a boy to fall in love with a girl than a girl fall in love with a girl. So the amount of things you can do with a girl are different to what you can do with a guy friend. I find that the dynamics are always a little different. Like, I can sleep over by a girl but I wouldnt sleep over by a guy."

Christian,fok6c0r,t3_g7ulvq,1587836203.0,"Well, as you can see by the numerous differing answers posted to this question, you cant ask just anyone. You need to pray about it, additionally you need to do unbiased research on it. There is only one true answer. The bible encourages us to seek out accurate knowledge so you need to go do research rather than relying on reddit for this question since various religions are answering and rather than getting an answer based on religions you should get an answer based on only the bible. Also, many of these people used scriptures to make their point but still came out with different answers so you need to really dig deep ask your self What Who When Where Why. I hope you find the accurate answer."

Don't delete the post and dont feel bad because someone doesn't agree with your opinion. You can't help that they arent mature enough to understand everyone has their own perspective and therefore their own opinions on matters. Don't let the bad comments get you down.

mentalhealth,fmfm8to,t3_fuqk4s,1586030203.0,Go see a therapist before you go to HR. HR will look at you differently because you cut yourself. It is the sad truth but them looming at you differently will only make working there harder. Try to work on yourself mentally so that you can deal with this problem. You can also talk to your therapist about this experience. No doubt you are battling more and heavier inner feelings after that incident which need to be handled internally. A therapist is best. You need to build a strong mentality for situations like these.

AskWomen,flgj6u1,t3_fofrcp,1585143887.0,Set boundaries so that you can be kind to others without giving people a straw to suck the life out of you. Being kind and empathetic is good. The problem comes when you meet manipulators who take your kindness and abuse it turning yourself into a pushover in the process. That is why boundaries are needed for you to keep your dignity. You can do some research on boundary setting. Follow millennial.therapist on instagram. They have posts about setting boundaries. There are other pages dedicated to helping people set boundaries and create stronger coping mechanisms.
