I literally explained to you the proof. I was going to send you a link to wikipedia of the metric system since it explains that indeed people did switch system, but I thought it was unnecessary because you have to be idiotic to believe the rest of the world would have never changed system.  


Some examples to show you that no, they did not all switch in 1790:  


India: 1956 (from imperial and various regional systems)  


South Africa: 1970 (had a variety of systems before 1922 when it switched to Imperial, and then 1970 to Metric)  


Greece: 1954 (from a greek system, and of course once upon a time had a different ancient greek system)  


Japan: 1924 (from Shakkanhõ)  


Iceland: 1907 (from an Icelandic system)....  


Last one happened in 2005 for fucks sake, Saint Lucia.  


Or 2013 with Myanmar (from burmese system, however not complete adoption)  


People have been able to throughout history, now is not different. Pretty much all ancient civilisations had their own systems and I can bet you that no, they did not use metric then... And neither do we use biblical and talmudic, or mesopotamian systems.  


Indeed I did, and if you'd read my point you would understand. They are far far smaller than both India and China, and yet both have implemented Metric. Then I showed Indonesia which is of similar population who have also implemented Metric system.  


It was an argument in case you'd try to say it's not about population but money instead, since I have proven it's not about population."

MURICA,fr22mqd,t1_fr193g4,1589830094.0,"It doesn't matter if x is a threat. When Germany was Europe's threat Germany was still a part of Europe. And Nato is not Europe, so it doesn't matter what allies there is in Nato. Belarus could be considered an enemy of Europe considering the fact it's the last surviving dictatorship.  


Additionally using NATO as an argument is stupid when Russia is a partner country of NATO.  


Russia is definently European. Yes, it's debatable how much can be attributed but to claim you know better than a European about what Russia belongs to is stupid. Yes. I am very aware most of Russia is indeed in Asia. BUT, and this is a very big but, 75% of Russia's population is in Europe. So if you go by population, which you should, since it's the population which create the economy, then Russia does belong to Europe.  


Then, Turkey... Again, most of it is indeed in Asia, no debate there. However. There are multiple reasons to allow them to be added to European statistics: first of all there's the facts that Turkey were one of the first countries joining the Council of Europe (pay attention, EUROPE) then the fact that Turkey wants to join the EU. Since 2005 they have negotiated to join the EU. So yeah, kind of telling they are at least in some degree European.  


But okay, let's be fair and halve the GDP per capita amount and add it to the European sum.  


First of all you've tried to sneakily manipulate the numbers by removing the 0.8 digit on Europe sum. That needs to be fixed. So by your calculations Europe would be without Russia and Turkey at  20.37 (22.8-0.7714-1.658=20.3706)  


I checked up USA GDP again and I'm getting a lower number in fact: [20.5443](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&idim=country:USA:CHN&hl=en&dl=en#!ctype=l&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=h&met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&rdim=world&idim=region:ECS&idim=country:USA&ifdim=world&hl=en_US&dl=en&ind=false)in 2018 which was the year I think all those I checked on were from. And the US GDP has only risen.  


So that means that already Europe is very close to the US, even without Turkey or Russia, which undeniably add to European GDP.  


So, lets take half of Russia and Turkey's GDP, so 0.7714+1.658/2= 1.6004.  


Let's add that back to the European GDP: 20.37+1.6004= 21.9704 and thus beating the US GDP whether my US GDP number is right or yours is.  


So, since you're being a dick, here we have discovered the person accusing someone of being illiterate is in fact the illiterate. Additionally, my perceived errors were not that of math, but facts in your opinion. Which I have here tried to as clearly as possible prove to you are not as wrong as you claim.  


Finally the point of me not knowing Europe or its history.... Really? Fuck off mate. I've lived and learnt about Europe since my conception."

So you honestly believe that all of the world except USA\* have always used the metric system?  


The fact that the metric system was developed in 1790 tells me that there must have been other systems before, such as the imperial system, which those now using the metric system used.  


It's evident you did not learn much of the outside world. Did you learn about the French Revolution? It was the foundation for the reform of archaic system of weights and measures to be made from.  


And then your argument of population. The USA is third. Both China and India have a much much higher population.  


1. China is at 18%  

2. India 17.5%  

3. USA at only 4.23%  

4. Fucking Indonesia is closer to the US than both second places at 3.43%  


The fact that these three countries with circa the same, or much higher population managed to switch to metric system while also in general being poorer tells me that the US has no real reason.  


Or if you think it's about being rich, since now the population argument has been handled, then you take a look at [this list](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/07/07/richest-countries-in-the-world/39630693/), which shows you that there are many countries far ahead of the US.

People were fighting against the rise of nazism and fascism both but it doesn't matter because they don't fight fairly. Men like Giacomo Matteotti tried passionately but were silenced (often murdered) just so they can gain more power.  


Matteotti were one of three party leaders during the 1924 election where Mussolini used the Acerbo law to manipulate the votes to gain a staggering 64.9% of votes. And since Matteotti continued to fight against Mussolini, both in parliament, and by releasing a book where he exposes fascism, he was kidnapped and murdered by the Camicie Nere.  


The point is, doesn't matter if he's unpopular. Dictators often gain the power by combining illegal and legal strategies to manipulate their way to gain absolute power.  


You're doing a dangerous thing by claiming it can't happen. That's how it happens, by underappreciating enemies you allow them to grow to power and then surprise you.

I looked at a table on wikipedia on the temperatures in Minnesota and I've experienced all of those both the warmth and the cold, and what I know Norway is the same, perhaps colder even.

Furthermore if you're going to be petty we can bring in the fact that you do need outside help. The success of the American revolution is partially because of France's contribution in finances, troops, equipment, leadership, and naval support.  
And then the fact that the US - ""The Worlds Mightiest Military Power"" was defeated by and got their pride wounded by Vietnamese farmers.  


Yes, the US is big and mighty, but don't think that you're invincible or all powerful."

Here, just maybe 10 minutes of research and I have debunked one of your claims.  


And for your UN budget thing, look at this picture: [link](https://things.qz.com/2019/unga-funding/assets/qz-medium.png) taken from this article: [link](https://qz.com/1712054/who-funds-the-united-nations/)  


Yes, the US is a significant player, however by combining Germany, UK, Sweden, Norway, Italy, and France together you go to around 11 billion, if my approximation is correct... and that is just 6 out of perhaps 44 countries.  


It is okay to be proud when your country does good, but if you lie and ignore facts you have to be knocked for that. Stop spreading false statements.  


However, is it really strange that a country with less than half of a continents population compete with that continent? It's not like comparing a regular small country like Italy to Sweden, comparing USA to a European country is wildly unfair simply because of the massive size differences in population."
MURICA,fqz0f6u,t1_fqg8qog,1589757690.0,"Which is why Americans are dying because they can't afford insulin or healthcare. Which is why people are so greatly uneducated because higher education essentially puts you in a too great dept for many people to be able to deal with. Which is why there is such a massive homelessness problem. And so on and so forth.  


Yes, the US have good things. Your entertainment business is awesome. You can't deny the US produce a lot of great movies and television, games, and music. But to claim you're the best is just pathetic. Any country who claims they are the best is likely not the best. My country, Sweden, is not the best. However I can see objective reasons it is a better place to live in."
MURICA,fqyzwqf,t1_fqgtn9n,1589757430.0,"I think you're giving them too much credit sadly. I think it's obvious that's the meaning behind the original, but many people use this meme template without that context to it."

It's dangerous and so sad because it comes at that persons expense. They should realise that we're not some sort of bully towards the US, the fact that so many people are passionate I think means rather that we're worried and wish the US would treat its people better. But they often decide to ignore this because of all the brainwashing in how great the US is. It's sad."
MURICA,fqyzdop,t1_fqxb4n1,1589757173.0,In fact! I care a lot about the US. I know how influential that country is so I really wish it would try to be a better role model and to be good to its citisen.
