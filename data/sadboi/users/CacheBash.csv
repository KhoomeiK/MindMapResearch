SuicideWatch,fmgjuph,t1_fmg8tru,1586050645.0,"It means that you should look at the cup as half full as to half empty. For example; If I have a brother and our dad is a drug dealer, he might follow the same path as him and either end up or in jail and say “That’s all I ever grew up around, how could I be any different?” Me and him are in the same situation right? Ok imagine that. I could be using the negative things to fuel me to be positive and do good things. I could end up being successful and say “Well all I ever grew up around was negativity, so I wanted to better than what I saw.” It’s just about how you’re looking at your situation. It’s not as bad as it seems. There is always someone dealing with bigger problems. Not saying that yours don’t matter, but it’s nothing to kill yourself over. It’s never that serious to end your life."
