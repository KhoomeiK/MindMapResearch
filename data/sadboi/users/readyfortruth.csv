depression,fe88i39,t3_enrs4c,1578923710.0,I do. Full stop.
depression,fdngkwi,t1_fdmpiu4,1578585357.0,And me
depression,fdng3d1,t3_elycos,1578585062.0,"It’s so easy for people to say just “cheer up”
or something along those lines.  Depression feels to me like a state of being.  It’s not a choice.  I haven’t taken the time to read the other comments on here but I can relate to your post.   It does feel like there is no point to it.  It feels like it’s rigged somehow.  I’m not sure what to make of it.   If I could make one person feel better it feels like I’m worth something- only to find out that they don’t appreciate It because they’re literally dealing with the same vicious cycle.   I hope your feel better."
depression,f2ego9v,t3_dd2zgf,1570194755.0,"This is a common problem i found.  The solution i developed is to become a better listener and to be a better friend.  A lot of people seek me out for advice and obviously it’s time consuming.  The real connection isn’t really there like i have always hoped it would be.  For the special times I really felt I had an amazing connection- it ultimately led to disappointment.  People can not maintain your happiness.  For me it’s a complete illusion to have a friend I really love and trust.  I feel your pain. 

To love oneself is a real choice.  I hate myself for being this alone.  

Good luck!"
depression,f1ip27a,t3_d9f2m4,1569513234.0,For me as well.
depression,f1ba5pr,t1_f1au6v2,1569328991.0,This speaks truth.
depression,f1ba24t,t1_f1aur4d,1569328904.0,Yup
depression,f1ba0vc,t3_d8i2u7,1569328873.0,I miss it too
relationship_advice,f1490b7,t3_d7padx,1569171142.0,Try.   Give her that.
SuicideBereavement,f11pzsy,t1_f0ukz0t,1569128944.0,You’re brave to share this with us.  You’re not alone.  We are all here.
SuicideBereavement,f11p47v,t3_d6mo25,1569128581.0,"I went once at a very vulnerable part of my life. It did more damage than good.  I could not get it off off mind and subsequently created a great deal of anxiety.  I went it with the attitude “what could it hurt”, but j was so susceptible to suggestions that it ravaged my mind.  The imagination could not be controlled.  Bad idea to go. Bad idea.  

Please don’t. 

Nothing about the reading was factual it was all reaching. (( “I see someone around a bed....”. Is it a relative?  ))

 (Seriously crap like that). Please don’t go it’s a set up for sure."
SuicideBereavement,f11o4nv,t3_d7hwpf,1569128194.0,I’m am really sorry you’re feeling this.  I have no words. I wish you could cry. I wish you could.
BreakUps,f0ylh2p,t3_d77uux,1569072767.0,This sounds similar.  I hope you’re ok.
depression,f0xffhu,t1_f0wmb3b,1569030947.0,It’s pretty tricky to make ends meet. That’s the reality for a lot of people.   Obviously we want to think it’s easier for someone else and we play games in our minds.  Then realize we are stuck.  I like coming to this sub because I don’t feel like I’m the only crazy one.  It’s a community of problems here.  How do we move forward?
depression,f0xf6da,t1_f0x1z5k,1569030723.0,Pretty much.
depression,f0s56c3,t1_f0rz9ig,1568899051.0,I appreciate it.  I don’t think people can really understand it’s literally not a choice. I completely bury all of it internally.  I have a family and I have to be responsible. And yet it’s impossible to function not knowing like hey I’m normal and this is just how I am.  But I do.  I’m really trying and I just need a little hope to know I’m not totally nuts or crazy. Thank you.
ForeverAloneDating,f0q8qrh,t3_d5mxmv,1568855783.0,Yeah good luck bro
Trufemcels,f0q03rd,t3_d61a96,1568851299.0,"You got to drop some weight then.   You can’t get taller. That’s just not possible but dropping weight you can.  It’s hard as heck but it can be done. 

Step One: stop thinking you can attract women for a year.  Maybe 2 even or more. You’ll be 27 (not too late)
Step two: Exercise.  Work out. Lose weight set a goal and do it.  (Not saying it’s easy)
Stop eating any crap. Period. 
Step three: Read.  Turn off social media, then off the games. For 2 years!
Step four: walk everywhere possible, ride your bike, walk the stairs. Refuse to use elevators etc
Step Five: work on your skills at your job.  Get to every class you can on time etc. 
step 6: no drinking etc. cut it out completely 
Step 7 : remember to eat well.  
Step 8 : start saving all your money all of it
Step 9: read books. 
Step 10: work on your self confidence 
Step 11: write your goals Down. Do them daily for a month!  Yes a month 
Step 12: add some good habits in there. 
Step 13: improve social skills. Takes time 

(Generally what I’m saying is if you want a quality partner you have to be a quality partner). There’s work involved.  I’m sorry if I seemed arrogant- I was just trying to show that a plan is all you might need.  You can do it!  

You’re not hopeless.  You’re worst trait is you might be  lazy like the rest of us and think someone owes us something.  Nope. 

Good luck!!!! I believe in all of us!"
depression,f0mawp0,t1_f0m2d1w,1568740816.0,I appreciate the comments.  Really. It’s very generous of you.  I don’t actually think I’m stupid but I feel it.  It’s on the inside and I bottle it all up.  Literally.  And it gets to you.  People do not understand depression if in fact I am.  And it’s literally not a choice or a mood swing. I relate to the people on here.  You’re all my heroes.
depression,f0lp7xx,t3_d5f6a8,1568725859.0,Or that you’re in debt way over your head
depression,f0lhqjq,t3_d5c56m,1568718518.0,Good night
depression,f0kxlh9,t1_f0jp914,1568690961.0,Oof.
depression,f0edoas,t1_f0e43dz,1568566725.0,You can and you are helping.  Even me. Thanks
depression,f0edjom,t3_d4l4qc,1568566663.0,Please please don’t.   I wish you would reach Out and PM me - I own a business and been on with it for a while. I will tell you I can relate to your posts.  Please don’t give up.  Please.
depression,f0e7dx6,t3_cwl19g,1568564180.0,I read like two of the post and comments and I can already relate.  Is this horrible?
BreakUps,ezecm6t,t3_d0un3r,1567862128.0,Assume you get back together how will it ever be better?
survivinginfidelity,eyxku8d,t3_cz3rpn,1567555895.0,Take a step back.  It’s over.  The details don’t matter and the sooner you get over this the better you’ll be.   It’s legitimately not you or anything logical.  It’s how women behave. It can not be fixed.  Good luck.
