relationship_advice,ezdmoq4,t1_ezdkov2,1567852164.0,"I’m going to tell you something that I wish someone had told me when I was 19-21 and dating someone who struggled with substance abuse and emotionally abused me - You deserve better. It sounds like you are making excuses for him, and that’s exactly what I used to do. I constantly doubted myself, and thought the way I was being treated was acceptable. 

If your boyfriend acts like this now over minor things, what is the future going to look like? Would you like to be married to this man? 

How can he care for you and be a supportive partner, if he can’t even look after himself?

My boyfriend (at the age of 19-21) was jealous, manipulative, controlling, and physically punched walls. He displayed behaviour similar to what you have described your boyfriend has done. 

One day it escalated into domestic violence. And I still stayed, because I thought I had done something wrong. 

Leaving him was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. 

Now I am happily engaged to my current partner of 4 years, who treats me the way I deserve."
relationship_advice,ezdjdy7,t3_d0u6fz,1567850837.0,You did absolutely nothing wrong. Your boyfriends behaviour is 100% irrational and unacceptable. His actions should be a huge red flag on whether or not you decide to continue this relationship.

Anxiety,evujicr,t1_evsrilq,1564797030.0,"I’m from Australia, and a lot of the time the grocery store is inside a big shopping centre (mall). The worst thing for me is hawkers. Or anyone trying to get my attention to sign up for this/buy that. The sheer act of them trying to get up in my face (sometimes even just shouting out hello) when I’m already stressed - is enough to give me a panic attack."
Anxiety,evuixrq,t3_cl3624,1564796569.0,"I understand how you feel OP. Yeah going to the store is really hard for me, but I want to be proud of other things instead of regular daily activities a lot of people have no issue doing. 

Hopefully one day, the more you take trips to the store, the easier it will get, and you’ll have a nice stress free routine."
