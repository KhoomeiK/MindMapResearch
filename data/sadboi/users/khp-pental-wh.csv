Opposing gay marriage in general takes away the agency and freedom for LGBTQ+ folks to marry whomever they love. They just want the same rights, that's all. Pre-martial sex includes all races, sexuality, and gender. But opposing gay marriage is specifically targeted at LGBTQ+ people. This in itself is against Christ's teaching to love everyone.

AskReddit,f28fae4,t1_f27hj42,1570060102.0,"yeah I see what you mean, but I feel like there's a bigger cause and reason why young/teenage girls try to dress or act older. I don't think it came from their minds to dress and act older. 


I don't think pointing fingers at them or being overly shocked will make it any better though. Sometimes even in girls clothing ads the girls are dressed way too mature than the boys that are in the same ad. And this is for children ads. 


If a guy still dates a girl even after knowing she's underage, that's messed up for the guy to do as well. Girls are often seen as ""emotionally mature for their age"" but that came from letting boys fooling around and being a kid (as it should be) while girls are indirectly/directly told to act more mature faster. 


To me it evokes more of a sad feeling that these girls feel like they have to dress and act like adults, than feeling creeped out or humoured for how they present themselves.

Everyday there was yelling and hitting, and everyone in the house was fearing for their safety because my biological father would threaten to kill us if we told anyone. Thankfully they're divorced through the help of social services and the police, but the trauma is still present.

If you have any reliable guidance counsellors at your school you can ask them for resources in which you can reach out, without your parents knowing. If the people know that telling your parents about your suicidal ideation could compromise your safety, they're legally not supposed to tell them (at least in Canada that is how it works. It's taken seriously). Resources where you can speak to mental health professionals (e.g. psychiatrist, therapist, social worker) to have the type of therapy you'd want (long term with high intensity or low intensity, etc.) 

&#x200B;

If you trust your school guidance counsellor you can tell him/her you've been feeling suicidal, however they don't have the knowledge (or level of education) so they aren't well equipped to do therapy sessions with you during school. Plus their job is to **refer** **you** to a qualified mental health professional when a student comes in and tells them about suicidal ideation or conditions where bringing in a specified professional is needed(school guidance counsellors and therapists are very different, have different levels of *training* regarding this, etc).

&#x200B;

Learned this the hard way, sometimes school guidance counsellors do *not* understand how mental illness and/or suicidal ideation works so they can be quite insensitive and dismissing to what you're going through. 

&#x200B;

Know your rights when reaching out to guidance counsellors: they **must** keep confidentiality (whatever you tell them while you're with them, unless there is a risk to your safety. However, if the risk is your parents or home environment, they should **not** be informing your parents bc the situation can get worse. They're job ***is to make sure you get the most help possible***.) **They should not shame you or guilt-trip you for feeling suicidal.** That is **not** what they're supposed to do. See a different guidance counsellor if they do *any* of this, or if there isn't anyone at your school, maybe mental health centres near your community or searching Google for phone numbers, addresses, or anonymous chatlines are a way too.

&#x200B;

DM me if you have any questions or just want to talk, I'm all here for you. You're not alone in having these thoughts and feelings, and the home environment you have to live through daily. This whole community is supporting you and can relate to things you're going through, although it might not be exactly the same. Don't feel bad for being suicidal, or that being bullied is your fault. It is not your fault, people pick at others' differences and target them. I didn't learn that until several years later after being bullied. There are no justifications to their behaviour, even the fact that they might be going through rough times too. It is wrong and very hurtful for anyone to let out their anger on someone else.

selfharm,f1qm8f2,t3_dae6sk,1569703241.0,"Even if I heard that I'd be sorta annoyed or like ruin my day. I think it 2as out of place for someone to say that s/He knows what you exactly feel and tell you to stop. We all know in this sub that it's not as easy as ""just stopping"", and that the reason why we self harm is complicated too. 


Self harm scars aren't something to be ashamed of, some do regret harming because of the scars they have but for me personally, it is the only thing I can do to cope and let out my emotional stress or insanity out. I have definitely tried very hard with other coping methods, but some things are just do hard to handle by listening to music or drawing(although it's a useful coping mechanism). 


When you do have children (or have other kids) asking you why you have scars, you can say what makes you comfortable. even saying stuff like ""it's my battle scar from fighting the white witch from Narnia"" can be a good excuse bc kids have a lot of imagination and most of the time don't think further about it. Maybe if they're older you can explain to them what self harm is, why one might use them to cope, and how it is not something to be mocked on or ashamed of. 


18 y.o. girl here and I'd be sad too if someone that didn't know me (or even if it was someone I was close to) said this. It invalids what we're going through and why we turn to self harm, and showing empathy or understanding would have been better than telling you what to do and say that they understand, when they might not."
selfharm,f1ovcl4,t3_da8wbh,1569663950.0,"From a medical standpoint only doctors (MD; eg. psychiatrist or GP) can ask to see your scars, check a part of your body for any injury, etc. I'm not sure about psychologists(since they have PhDs), but I have been told in the past from multiple mental health + medical professionals that I can decline or refuse an answer to a request or question I am not comfortable with or don't want to answer to therapists, and even doctors (unless it's essential for your health and safety).


However, I have heard that ""it's not that bad"" frequently from my therapists, not regarding my scars but the severity of my experiences and symptoms of my mental illnesses. It really does trigger me and makes me almost feel like I need to get worse to get help..? Anyway you should switch out/no longer see therapists that invalidate anything you tell (or in this case show them), it's just one of the major signs they aren't going to be great therapists. I sometimes regrettably did give multiple sessions and more time thinking that they are actually good therapists, they just said that one thing wrong, but sadly they always bring invalidation up in other ways (such as their tone of voice or reaction when you say something very vulnerable)."

SuicideWatch,ewu2snb,t3_cpy5ew,1565762102.0,"""Unfortunately, a life like this is almost impossible for the mentally unwell...knowing you'll have these illnesses for the rest of your life.""

You know, I've thought this exact thing countless times. Sometimes I said to to therapists and psychiatrists hoping they could understand..or just listen, but sadly, all they ever told me was that ""it would get better"" or that I ""had lots waiting for me."" 

I also have an extreme fear of rejection and abandonment. Truth be told, I can't even manage any kind of social relationship longer than a month. I also distrust people, and put an emotional guard up. 

I don't know what to say...I guess we both know there are people who experience these experiences and emotions too, although it may not be exactly the same. 

To be honest, I won't stop you from suicide, bc when people did that to me, it never got to me, and if I really wanted to die, I know no person or thing could prevent me from doing it. I hope that you can capture and witness your last moments in peace. That it'd be something you carefully thought about before going. If you do go, I think I'll see you there soon enough, bc I too, am planning to kill myself soon. Isn't it so devastating sometimes that mental illness is such a lonely and personal battle? I wish it would be otherwise, but unfortunately, with the medical information and development we have now, there seems to be a limit to how mental illness is understood."
selfharm,ewlazfx,t3_cng4uq,1565514797.0,I personally look at them as scars that remind me I went through hard times and it was real. But calling them as battle scars does give me the idea that people are romanticizing self-harm/self-harm scars.
selfharm,ewlavlz,t3_coihvk,1565514632.0,"If you develop a trust with your therapist you could bring up the topic of self-harm, probing on what he/she thinks about it. If you trust him/her enough, you could tell about your cutting. 

&#x200B;

Just bc your cuts aren't deep or don't leave lasting scars doesn't invalidate the pain you're feeling inside, and how you're using self-harm to cope. Telling your therapist or doctor (or both about self-harm) could aid them in getting to the root of reason why you self-harm, and will be able to help you better with that information.

&#x200B;

I don't think you're an attention seeker, or any other person who self-harms. I know that it's a coping method to mask our internal (mental and emotional) turmoil we're facing inside. I self-harm too, and trying to get better. You might need to switch between therapists until you find the one that you can trust and understand you, because the therapist-client relationship or that ""click"" is important in opening up and them being able to give you the proper support. 

&#x200B;

even posting on here is a step forward, although you may be anonymous you're taking the step to write about your feelings and thoughts and seeing if others feel the same or have words to let you know that there are people who care about you and we know you're here. thanks for sharing your secret with me, and we can work towards together. that's what we're for, aren't we? to vent, listen, and we ourselves bc we can understand each other the best."

Unless they see physical evidence of suicidality and illness with their eyes, they don't take my words seriously. 

&#x200B;

I've also only gotten help when I've risked taking my life or were close to it; other than those times, they considered that I wasn't seriously suicidal or mentally ill enough to be helped. Because of this, I purposely sometimes dress or speak or behave in a certain way to show that I'm experiencing in my mind is real, because they always have their skeptical faces when I'm talking to them."
AskReddit,etqp63l,t1_etqo6hx,1563095903.0,"I do know that some girls do things for themselves and some girls do it because of their insecurities, while many do it for both of these reasons. Yes, the comments from these men and their intentions or tone behind it was my personal judgement and assumption, but the way they word their comments and use phrases such as ""ew"" or ""gross"" shows that their intentions weren't to say ""don't do that for others"" but ""don't do it because I don't find it attractive"" or ""I disagree with it so I discourage people to do it."" There are negative implications that can be detected in their comments, and I don't mind if they have personal preferences on what they like, it's that they push their preferences (which are arbitrary) so strongly that it conveys a message that their personal opinions should be heard more loudly than the women's (or any other person in any given situation on how they like to physically express themselves).


Oftentimes the question ""what do guys find attractive/unattractive in girls?"" is more heavily highlighted, answered, and told as if to indirectly teach girls or women how to dress, behave, and talk. There was one redditor that commented on how he ""doesn't like fake laughs"" when another dude ""wanted girls to laugh at his jokes."" So based on these two answers (which comes up quite often--about how girls are superficial yet when they're not they're considered uptight or boring), girls need to laugh but not too obviously or loudly so that the guy(s) don't notice she is fake laughing.


I do see what your main point is though, and thanks for bringing that up in a polite manner and initiating conversation instead of an argument. However, even though OP didn't directly ask the question to reflect themselves, some commentors could've realized halfway through their comments that they didn't need to word things a certain way, or see how they could possibly be nitpicking at others' insecurities when they wouldn't appreciate it when they were given the same kind of treatment."
AskReddit,etqlp8j,t3_cctsng,1563090771.0,"This is the most judgmental thread I've seen on Reddit...some of the things girls do (ie. fake nails, plastic surgery, makeup, etc) are because they want to do it for themselves, and I don't see why they shouldn't do it because some guys don't want that. Instead of judging people for being themselves (ie duck face), I think many people commenting on this post should look at themselves instead. We have have traits that might be attractive/unattractive to others, or in this case, *specific* *genders*, but too many of these comments seem like somehow they've got it all figured out and think they can set their personal opinions as standards that should be obeyed. 

&#x200B;

I genuinely wanted to read this post without getting the idea that guys/men are judging and criticizing women and what they're comfortable with, but seriously, so many of you are missing the real reasons why some women do these things. Also, it's quite ironic how people are pointing things out that are unattractive of others yet doesn't take a second to reflect on themselves."

I read this one thing around the internet once though, and it’s that life is not something I can show you why (or how) to live, but you can learn to see it for yourself as to why you would want to live—not for others, not bc they’ll be sad, or bc it’s expected of you, but putting yourself first and figuring out your own reasons. I didn’t quite word this greatly (since it’s been a while), but it did open my eyes when I was contemplating suicide. I’m still suicidal. But many times in my life I thought of reasons to ‘stay alive’ for someone else, some other reason that didn’t include how I felt and thought, and knowing that I can learn to figure it out while my support system (whether it’s your therapist, psychiatrist, friend, this sub, pets) is right by me, did change the way I saw things. 


If you do have a chance, “How I Stayed Alive When My Brain Was Trying To Kill Me” by Susan Rose Blauner is a book that helped me when I was (still am) alone. 


And I also did worry that I was going to hell for killing myself (since I was raised religious), but if God was real and what we were taught about Him was real, He wouldn’t be a person to punish you for going through all of life’s shit, He’ll be embracing you with warm hugs and tell you that you’ve went through enough, and let you know that it’s not your fault."
