You're not an asshole for saying no, you're an asshole for saying ""yes, if you can cough up $5k"". If it was really an emotional boundary issue, putting a dollar value on it is pretty callous, and reads like ""no you can't have my precious baby, unless you cough up some cold hard cash, then igaf"".
She's an asshole for not accepting ""no"" straight away, especially if you expressed that it was an emotional boundary.
Everyone else is an asshole for telling you that your boundaries are wrong, but then you have to remember that you made it about money and they probably assume you only said no from a position of greed.
