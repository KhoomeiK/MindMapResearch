For one thing I'm a bit older and this all went down in the 80s which is a time modern mormons try to pretend wasn't like it was.  But OBVIOUSLY the things that went on are still in the older generations.  

Children are accessories, props, goals to check off on the way to godhood.  They aren't really people like parents, who are always subordinate to anyone older, especially since you don't appear to be mormon, you will never really be a full fledged person with full rights to them, you are mentally defective for not seeing the way.  Children become token people if they survive to 8 to be baptized, but not really regarded with real value until they are large, and then they must serve elders perpetually until they are the grandparent age. 

Children, particularly girl children, needed to be broken if they didn't come out of the womb nice and meek and submissive.  This was spoken of in my earshot as something I needed on the regular.   

I was deprived of air quite casually, as an amusement, beginning I don't know, infinitely since the beginning, I know I was still breastfeeding age.  ""Look at the dolly squirm!""  This went on until I was ~11 and was ""beginning to form memories"" laawwwwlllll...  And all the while I was of course not allowed to have feelings about it because it was an uproariously good time for my parents, or a deserved punishment, either way.  So there is a very strong culture in the older folks of literal torture and refusal of the impact.  It can't matter to the lesser being because the dominant being found it appropriate.  

Mormons introduced waterboarding as an enhanced interrogation technique, air deprivation is just THAT ingrained in the culture.

Google ""mormon waterboarding cia"" to get plenty of other results.  My parents, these grandparents, and lots of abusers in the church have what is known as a temple recommend.

Children's birthdays stop having extended family involvement at some point, usually before 12, you are fine to leave her out, in general public perception.  Stopping by granny's for a card, present, and cake in an after the fact manner is *normal* and usually happens within a week or two afterwards."
JUSTNOMIL,f1i3qmm,t3_d9gehj,1569505489.0,"I'm so glad you got yourself taken care of!  It is a horrible shame that she neglected to take care of you properly herself.  

I can relate, although mine has no medical training.  She got herself a diagnosis of dysmenorrhea, which she felt meant worst cramps.  So when I got mine starting at 11, and wound up puking every month, sobbing in agony, and some months unable to get off the floor due to graying out from the pain, she decided I was an exaggerating whiner.  After all, she already had the worst cramps, so OBVIOUSLY I was just making a big deal out of nothing.  

The reason I think she exaggerated her own situation and therefore projected that it was ME doing the exaggerating?  She was prescribed real pain killers for her cramps.  She didn't like them, they made her feel ""floaty"".  

I would have killed for some relief.  I wasn't allowed.  I was going to lay on the floor in agony but I would have happily laid on the floor feeling floaty.  Since she always said it to me, I think she had normal cramps and was a whiner.  

The second I turned 18 I got some birth control.  OMG, something that worked!!"

Probably they used up the session and won't get any feedback until the next week.  Hope the therapist wrote down some reactions, I know mine forgets everything in two weeks..."

Easy to swipe the notification away while only witnessing a few words...  I mean, that's an android thing, but it ought to be a universal thing...  

And yeah, I would bet money there's an app that does even better, no notifications at all.  

Anyways, on android I believe it is found under the three bars doohickey at the top right.  Mute/unmute should be there.  (Depends on your version, app, phone probably)  I've seen the three bars called settings, menu, and hamburger lol!  Might even be three dots or a gear wheel.  Can we get some consistency?"

I guess if you and he can't get distance from her and depending on her, he seems a lost cause or currently not worth how much she is enmeshed in his life and triggering your past issues while you are her captive in the car.  :(  

Original comment:It's going to be super awkward, but if you walk in and find her there, excuse yourself, ""Oh!  You already have company, let's do this again some other time.""  

She really does want to push you out.  So... how much does he want you?  Will he make the effort?  It's on him to tell her not to be there on date nights."

JUSTNOMIL,f1c0pub,t1_f1bqbsz,1569347271.0,"Yup, and I think it is highly likely they told him while at work BECAUSE OP was busy with her own things and not catering to them.  They felt ""pain"" at not being top importance, so it was urgent to pass that ""pain"" along.  Sad people. :("

JUSTNOMIL,f1br46o,t3_d8kc0l,1569341078.0,"My JNMom still has a relationship with my very first boyfriend from high school.  She's nuts, absolutely.  That was over 20 years ago now.  

The only motivation I know of was that he promised to ""ruin my life"", which no, my life is rocking.  What he probably meant was he would tell my JNMom we had sex, and the fact that he would provide inside info on me to her is what keeps her in touch with him.  She did send him to me after a break up, and again when I finally stopped being a nomad, so I think she always wanted me back with him, probably BECAUSE he could be counted on to tattle on me.  

Sounds like the motivation is different in your case, but ultimately probably the same, you could have served a purpose for her that her child wasn't fulfilling. 
Deep confessions/insight, emotional punching bag replacement and household servant, ultimately the same thing to a JustNo.  A tool.  You made the right move, she's crazy, not you, you were smart to get out."
bipolar2,f1agu4i,t1_f18zros,1569293628.0,"You are maybe a quarter of the way through your life, optimistically.  Think all the way back to your earliest memory, how long ago that feels, and add a few more years.  

Do you want to spend three times that long with this guy?  (Optimistically in many ways.)  

I am halfway through my life, and I am SO glad I waited until my late twenties to marry.  All studies on age of marriage suggest late twenties is best, your brain has finished growing (around 26), you've had time to find your way into a decent job probably.  And that enables you to pick a better life partner.  Not just ""like him, helps make rent, good sex"".  

Reach higher.  Keep up his charade of engagement until you can go look for greener pastures.  If you think abusive guy and neglectful guy are the sum of your prospects, you need to move!  Have you ever traveled?  I hope this isn't ""all my family is here, I can't ever leave"", those are some of the worst places to be stuck, yeah the guys will suck."
