i read this poem as a case of a couple being together at the wrong time in their lives. the love and effort seems one sided as well. this reminded me of my first serious relationship. i was 19 and he was 20. i was not in the right place to be in a relationship, and he liked me more than i liked him, i think that's why the break up didn't hit me until over a year later.  your poem reminded me of it. it all feels like a distant memory now"

enfj,fq8foet,t3_g50uc2,1589165145.0,"Honestly, I’m an ENFJ and I will say that unless the ENFJ in question is super self-aware, we tend to be pretty shitty listeners.

We are empathetic in nature and we don’t *mean* to hijack the conversation. I have realized I do this sometimes unintentionally. No one has told me or ever complained about it, but I feel self-conscious of it because I have witnessed it in the other ENFJs I know, and I have caught myself doing it. I have a lot of friends who listen to me when I need them, but I really need to be a better listener for them. 

Like I said, no one has ever complained to me about it but I know I do this and I am trying to be cognizant of it and just listen to people, as well as have a decent amount of seconds go by after their last comment before I say something else or start a new conversation.

So, I don’t know why your mom got mad that you called her out on this. Frankly, I would love to be called out on this because I know it’s hella annoying when others hijack a conversation, especially when they know I am coming to them to vent or for them to just listen."

ticktick,fpnlkq9,t1_fpmwry9,1588766699.0,"Thanks for your comment. I appreciate you sharing your method with me!

I think I am a little confused, though. Here is my example for why an ""incomplete"" option is necessary: 

Say I plan to wake up everyday at 5:30 A.M..

Let's say I was able to complete that task on Monday, however, the next day I woke up late. So the task for Tuesday is incomplete because I wasn't able to wake up at 5:30 A.M. There is no way to ""redo"" this, because unfortunately I'm not a time traveler yet. 

So now it's Wednesday and I was able to complete the task. However, thee way it works on TickTick's to-do list and calendar is that you are not able to check mark Wednesday's wake-up task as ""complete"" unless you either 

1.) Mark yesterday's task (waking up at 5:30 A.M.) as complete. Which is incorrect and thus does not allow you to reflect on the days you have missed (as you mentioned, reflection of incomplete tasks are beneficial), nor does it give an accurate representation of your overall tick-tick statistics

2.) Press the ""skip the occurrence"" option from your to-do list or calendar, in which it  doesn't show that the task was ""incomplete"". Rather, it removes that task entirely from the day you didn't complete it as if you never created the task for that day in the first place. Again, this does not allow you to reflect on the days you have missed nor does it give an accurate representation of your overall TickTick statistics.

&#x200B;

I hope this example made sense. If this is easily fixed by your method, or an existing method, then let me know. I just don't think I'm following your example quite well for a case like this, which is ultimately why I believe the ""incomplete"" option is necessary."
