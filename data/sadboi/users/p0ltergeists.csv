If I can't bury, I keep all spell remains or offerings in a specially marked bottle with my sigil for Hades on it. When I'm able, or when the time of year, moon phase, etc is best, I find an appropriate place and bury then. The flower pot suggestion I've seen people make is pretty great too. Good luck!"

dementia,fggwq46,t3_eua4mm,1580771266.0,"I think it has a lot to do with their eye movement/inability to hold eye contact like before, and their facial expressions/lack of a use of facial muscles in the same way. My mom can sometimes look very different to me than she used to and its because she doesn't use her facial muscles as much any more, so he just looks kinda neutral all the time, and her eyes dart around the room all the time and she can't make eye contact for long, so she looks lost all the time."
dementia,fggumc0,t3_exud25,1580769925.0,"I'm 23 years old and my mom is 57, she has frontotemporal dementia. She started getting bad symptoms around 8 years ago. She is not as far along as your mom, she can still form words and sentences. She does require help with bathing, feeding, dressing, and many other daily activities, though. The struggle is very hard for someone as young as we are to be having to deal with something like this. We are supposed to be in the prime of our life, forming our OWN lives, and it can seem impossible to do that when we are having to care for someone full time like this. I know how tiring it can be.

I just try to tell myself, especially on a day like today which has been really bad for me, that it's not her fault. She's not doing this on purpose, and if she was in her right mind, she would not want me to be doing all this and suffering in this way. I just try to remember that she took care of me when I was a babbling, helpless child who needed help with everything and couldn't communicate my needs either. I know it doesn't take any of the frustration away really, but it at least puts me in a better headspace."

&#x200B;

One particular instance I remember is back from when I was maybe 12 years old. I had a dream that was the exact same location and scenario 4 nights in a row: a clown was chasing me through the woods near my old house trying to murder me. Each time I had the dream, I would remember ""I've done this before!"" and try to change what I did in order to beat the clown, but the first three nights, he found me and killed me and that's house the dream ended. Night four, I managed to outsmart the clown and kill him. Then, the dreams stopped. Pretty strange, but super satisfying to finally kill the bastard!"

BPD,ert46tr,t3_c3j8pi,1561231978.0,"That's the biggest thing: most of us don't consciously manipulate people. That's part of what makes it so dangerous. We don't do it actively or on purpose, it's ingrained in the way we treat people and interact with them on a fundamental level. It's fuck up, and it's not our faults, but it's true. 

Some examples of how I know I can manipulate people is that I will over-exaggerate the bad things that happen to me for sympathy and the good things for praise, I'll try to flirt with someone or seduce someone to get what I want from them, or I'll put someone in a situation that makes them feel afraid to leave me alone. Typically, I do all this without actively thinking about it. Only after the fact do I recognize how shitty the behaviour actually is. In my past, this behaviour has even escalated to doing things like threatening to hurt myself/kill myself in order to gain the desired outcome from people in my life. Usually it's to keep someone from ""abandoning me"" or to have someone give me the kind of attention I seek in the moment, but occasionally it's monetary/physical outcomes as well. 

I personally do my best to catch these behaviours in myself before I do them, or while they're happening. But sometimes, it's just so much a part of the way I interact and socialize that it's hard for me to realize it's even happening. The way I try to combat this is that I sit down with my friends and loved ones a lot, when my mood is stable and head is clear, and I try to talk to them and remind them what kind of behaviours to watch out for in me. That way, even if I personally don't recognize it, they can recognize it and remind me ""hey, you're doing that thing again, stop it."" Honestly does help - it's sobering and helps to kinda bring me down like ""oh shit, I am doing that thing aren't I."""
BPD,ert318l,t3_c3r8n7,1561231074.0,"Feeling like my partner isn't listening to me is a MAJOR trigger for me, oof. The ""thinking something is stupid"" thing is something that gets on my nerves, but usually not exponentially. But regardless of the situation, I usually don't hurl insults at my partner/friends over it. Sometimes I throw a tantrum or get angry, but I don't attack anyone over it. My fiance has told me sometimes he feels like he has to walk on eggshells around me, for fear that I'll freak out (though I'm more of a cryer than a yeller). I have the capability to do something like that and I have in the past, but I guess I just don't have it in my heart to purposefully insult my fiance over something like that. I wish I had some advice for you in that regard. But I offer you my support, friend."

I love him to death, there's no reason I should be distancing myself the way I am. I've been talking to him a lot less, and I blamed it in my head on him. I guess I just convince myself I'm gonna do something to drive him away (like what has happened to me in the past).

Please, if you need to talk, message me privately. If you're feeling suicidal, call the national suicide hotline. (1-800-273-8255).

Maybe try talking to them about it and seeing if there's anything the two of you can work out to help you while they're gone?
