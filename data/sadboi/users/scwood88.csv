iPadOS,ew17z1q,t3_cgf2u7,1565017337.0,"I use the Spark app on my Mac, iPhone, and iPad.  The email templates are great for me! I also like the swipes.  It has quite a lot of options to make your business life easier.  It's worth using.  I think it's the best email app I've used.  

&#x200B;

I do have a question and if anyone knows the answer, I'd love to hear it! When I get an .ics calendar invite emailed to me, how can I select which calendar to send the event to?  Right now, every event goes to my default calendar.  If I change it to a different calendar, it wants to send that change to everyone on the list.  Anyone else stuck with this?"
