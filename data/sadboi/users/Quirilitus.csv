Unrelated - I totally disagree with the change. There is no reason to fix something that isn't broken. This is a subreddit with a relatively small audience and I, as a regular browser, wouldn't say that children or adolescents on this sub has been nearly a dramatic enough issue to warrant putting the sub on NSFW/18+. r/shrooms, r/lsd, and other similar subreddits have no such setting enabled. 

Nobody is going to admit to being under 18 on reddit. Nor are they going to voluntarily stop browsing this sub because its 'age-restricted'. If you are so concerned about harm reduction, allow teenagers, who will use DXM whether you like it or not, to read the harm reduction info on the sub, which is plastered everywhere. 

This is also not first and foremost a harm reduction sub. That's like saying r/cars is first and foremost an accident prevention sub. It's immature and condescending. This is a subreddit to discuss DXM, the world of DXM, the effects of DXM, and yes, harm reduction as well, but it isn't a harm reduction subreddit before anything else.

NoStupidQuestions,eulijjx,t3_cflz37,1563901659.0,"Hispanic and Latino aren't racial or ethnic identifiers anymore (if they ever were). I think a misunderstanding of these terms is contributed to by American ignorance of South American and European history. People seriously don't understand that Spanish is a European language brought over to South America by European conquerors, not an indigenous language of that continent.

Hispanic and Latino in common parlance are generally used to refer to mestizos, which make up the bulk of most Latin American countries and generally include people of mixed European and indigenous American ancestry. The ratio of ancestry is variable so you can have people who are 90% white 10% Indio (indigenous american), 75% Indio 25% white, etc. There are also significant populations in all of those countries of 100% Europeans, and of 100% Indios. 

So no, I don't think that most Americans are thinking of Spaniards or white Latin Americans when they say Hispanic. I'm Spanish (from Spain) and my girlfriend is a white Argentinian and we are never considered Hispanic or Latino.

As I came to, I would slowly lift my arms and it would feel as though there were sandbags lying on them. I never felt that I was 'falling' or 'dropping'. Even when I first felt the effects after smoking the plant, it was more of a sort of conscious force obligating me to lie down to 'enjoy the experience' than a physical impulse. I also felt a tremendous and indescribable body high. Almost exactly like a THC body high - right there on the border between pleasurable and irritating.

DXM seems to cause more of an 'in-motion' feeling - for me, being on a high dose of DXM made me feel as though my room had taken off from Earth and was soaring through space.

Salvia,erdhmdd,t3_c1c1yl,1560742319.0,"I've never broken through, but my salvia experiences heavily involve the location in which I am at that moment. I think that this is a common theme with psychedelics - the environment heavily defines your experience. I have experiences in the wilderness that led to a renewed appreciation of love of nature and of the planet Earth, an experience in my childhood bedroom that caused me to think back upon the first girl that I ever loved, with whom I had shared that room, and recently, in the same room, a salvia trip, that picked up on the colors of my bedsheets and incorporated them into my tactile illusions. 

The most curious thing that occurred to me on salvia was that I felt that my 'point of reference' had become my bedroom, rather than the usual 'area behind your eyes' (I think Alan Watts writes about this in one of his books - our assumption of a bodily 'point of reference'). So everything was observed in motion relative to the still room, rather than to my body. 

I have never felt a 1950-1960 environment - perhaps because I have no special attachment to it; I have never experienced anything like it. Mind-altering drugs seem to bring to my mind landscapes and places that I am either already familiar with or, especially, those that were once important to me that I have now forgotten.

The most iconic 'place' that I enter on high doses is an undefined, indescribable 'state of mind' that, like a dream, I forget the subjective reality of which as soon as the experience is over, while usually at least remembering that such a place exists. What is it like? I think of it as an electric highway, or a sort of senate, in which all of the different constituents of my mind are engaging in rapid dialectic - a sort of continuous, high frequency, incredibly complex conversation that occurs at all times, my psychedelic experiences being only brief sojourns, touristic visits, into a place that has always existed and will exist until I am no longer around!"

I don't feel like the salvia actually affected my mood very much (during the experience), other than making me more anxious (I was already anxious going in). I don't think salvia really has a great effect on mood either way. I definitely felt a ton of crazy stuff (you can read my post history if you want to see my report), but I never forgot that I had taken a drug or that I existed. 

Mushrooms definitely helped me out on a standard dose (an eighth) (it was actually one of the most significant and beautiful events of my life), but my higher dose experience with it just brought me to the same crazy psychedelic realm that I've been to on LSD and salvia and what it taught me had very little to do with the mundane affairs of my Ego's life

Have you tried DXM? That's the number one thing I would recommend to you. It's the only substance I've ever taken where I feel that it actually works toward making you happier and more at peace. The best part is that it isn't a purely physical, opioid warmth - it involves recalling memories and appreciating things that you thought you'd forgotten. Especially because you have a gf (you get an incredible urge to talk on DXM and it gets lonely and sad if you don't have someone to share with). Though be wary about extreme doses, because, while they're certainly worthwhile and interesting, they take you so far out into the universe that your emotions and anything that you can relate to now, sober, go out the window"

Salvia,er8md3i,t3_c0l844,1560607542.0,">1. The strong sense of deja vu (""oh yes, how could I have forgotten this"")

This has definitely happened to me on high doses of LSD, shrooms, and salvia. I first entered the place I'd later 'recall' in deja vu when I took 600 mics of LSD, and spent a ton of time there (at least that's how it felt). It's a bizarre place that I could not describe and that I don't even remember while sober. Like something out of a dream, but it feels real while it is occurring. It's not a physical space, but a sort of symposium or collection of dialectic thoughts that are rapidly discussing various things in a way that is so efficient and rapid that it gives me a headache. This place isn't at all pleasant to be in, though it is interesting. To me, it feels like the inevitable stop for all psychedelics; like, you can't go any farther than this, and trying to go farther and 'answer the question', find 'It', is utterly impossible. My high-dosage experiences with DXM have, however, led me along different routes to different places, utterly unlike this one (i felt a sort of extreme disassociation; as though i were floating in a purple-tinged space, every one of the atoms of my body separating and vibrating together). 

*oh yes, how could I have forgotten this*  - I must say something just like this to myself every time I reach this place and feel the familiar though alien feeling again lol

> 2. Feeling that you have been tricked/pranked (""now you've gone and done it, you weren't supposed to come back here!"")

I've really never felt this, though I'd say that salvia definitely had a more mischievous vibe than the other experiences, although weak. I am always welcomed back to the realm mentioned above and not mocked for being there; it is in fact as though I were observing myself, just a different part of myself. I have met a negative entity once, but it was definitely an evil and malicious one that genuinely wanted to hurt me, and not just trick or prank me.

>3.Presence of entities/beings located behind you to the right, who can communicate with you telepathically

What I get is some sort of strange woolly 'forest' entity that feels like it is centered in my line of vision, like perhaps literally on my face where my nose is. I don't actually see it, but I 'feel' its impression. It's sort of a sign that I've re-entered the psychedelic realm. It has a greenish-brown, earthy color to it and seems to change the rest of my field of vision as well. During my salvia experience, I heard a lot of internal speech, but this entity never chimed in.

>4. Visuo-tactile synesthesia, experiences of the ""reality factory"", ""lego people"", ""the wheel"", ""conveyor belts"", ""zippers"", ""slices"", ""the parade""

I've never *literally* seen any of these things, but I would 'feel' similar phenomena, if that makes sense. Though the whole experience was strongly influenced by what I *thought* salvia would be like, what I was expecting, and what I was hoping for after reading this sub for a while. The common 'being on a turned page' never happened. I think I even tried to bring it on, but I never felt it. I never felt a reality factory, wheel, zipper, slice, or conveyor belt either, but I did get a sort of toy house feeling, in which I felt that to get 'beyond the veil' and reach the 'true salvia realm', my room and I had to be 'torn off' like a sticker; this was never achieved. Later on, when I was 'deeper in', I felt as though I had accessed the uppermost, most superficial layer of my subconscious and felt another entity - it felt like a factory floor manager, for some reason - was ordering around 'the factory' (i didn't physically see a factory) to produce and distribute various thoughts to my consciousness

> 5. Becoming an inanimate object


Hasn't happened to me on salvia or any of the psychedelics, but I definitely felt this way on DXM. The closest thing on salvia was that I became very 'associated' with my bed sheets and with my room, so that I felt that we were moving together, and that the whole room was now the 'point of reference', not just me."
Salvia,er8kop9,t1_er8kfmz,1560606558.0,Okay. The smoke was just so awful that I felt like I had to cough. How long should I draw in the smoke? How do you know if you have  'broken through' on S?
Salvia,er8jxf6,t1_er8je7c,1560606110.0,"I took it for the first time yesterday (20x) - smoked it out of a very small pipe; i took three hits (holding each one in for about 10 secs), lied down, and then would take another few hits about 5 mins later. Did this about 5 times. It felt like it just kept getting stronger lol and I felt no afterglow or otherwise negative effects, though I felt anxious as hell the whole time"
Salvia,er7u0ow,t1_er7ntl0,1560587567.0,"Interesting thoughts.

>It's better just not to try compare salvia to psychedelics as they are clearly very different drugs acting on very different brain systems.

Hm. The experience to me felt very much like a psychedelic experience, and the overall ‘feel’ was almost identical to my higher dosage LSD/shrooms experiences (high dose DXM still stands completely apart from the LSD/shroom/salvia category). I felt like I was approaching the same interconnected highway of subconscious communications that I’d entered into with those substances. However, I never felt that I was in contact with the divine. Perhaps this is because I’ve experimented and am accustomed to hearing voices or feeling the presence of ‘higher beings’, but I never felt that I was being ‘possessed’ by some greater animating spirit, but rather that I was going ‘a level below’ and taking a ‘tourist trip’ to my Id/subconscious. But it certainly still felt psychedelic.

As for the objects thing, or tactile synthesia - this does remind of DXM, though on DXM it was less visual though more powerful. My DXM delusions involved little to no evidence. I felt that I was a ‘bean’ that had to ‘bean out’ with my friends and it made perfect sense without having to actually visualize beans. Whereas on salvia I would sort of see the colors of my sheets transforming or being incorporated into some extension of my body, and my entire visual exterior would be assimilated into my point of reference (so that the colors and shape of my room - violet and burgundy - were no longer things that I as a separate point of reference was *in*, rather that room was now the point of reference, as it would be if you were to be focusing on it from a 2D view of a dollhouse.)"
Salvia,er7exg6,t1_er7e8as,1560576160.0,"i have depression but didn't really feel more or less depressed before or after. just neutral. shrooms on the other hand killed my depression for a while the first time i took them. i felt like DXM is the best for depression though, even on low doses. especially because it isn't as bizarre and world-altering as the psychedelics."

Salvia,er7bdj0,t1_er7aqfq,1560573493.0,"have you taken any other serious mind-altering substances? do you feel that you've ever entered the 'true' realm? don't know how to describe it. if you have, you'll know."
Salvia,er6a0ai,t1_er63odz,1560543117.0,thanks man
Salvia,er5sz4y,t1_er5nopv,1560532866.0,I’ve researched a good amount and survived & learned from heroic doses of other mind-altering substances. Just asking on reddit because i find actual human feedback better than the million blog posts or fake erowid stories that come up on Google.
Salvia,er5sst0,t1_er5jouo,1560532761.0,I won’t have a trip sitter. My psychedelic experiences have always been alone. Thanks for the advice.

NoStupidQuestions,eqq0xvz,t1_eqay3uu,1560209250.0,"literally, ‘that one’. Similiarly, ‘um’ and equivalents of ‘like’ are not common fillers in Spanish. It is more common, especially in LatAm, to say ‘ese’ or ‘este’, which mean ‘that one’ or ‘this one’"

Minecraft,epwiah6,t1_epu449r,1559576533.0,"I never understood people that called MC ugly. Just the fact that the things you saw in the game were either completely randomly generated or created by you or your friends gave them a significance that couldn't be replicated in any mainstream game. And that you could actually explore and create whatever you want. And how intuitive the game is. I never even thought the graphics were ugly - they were ideal for the concept behind the game. Of course now I look back at early versions and think that they look ugly compared to the current version, but that's just because I've been spoiled lol. My log house would look boring in plain included in the background of any other game. But because I built it myself, with resources I spent significant periods of time collecting, on 'natural' land, I take pride in it and find it beautiful."
