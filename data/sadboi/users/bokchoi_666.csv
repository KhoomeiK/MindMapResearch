BPD,fo47xmg,t1_fo4695s,1587499731.0,"I understand exactly what you mean... i feel like i’ve been able to self-introspect myself a lot since getting clean, and i guess “self-heal”. My subconcious wants me to get off my meds, but my concious mind always ends up getting me to my psychiatrist the next month, just to get more of my meds “in case i need them” if that makes any sense haha"
BPD,fo45v3z,t3_g5l1dj,1587498715.0,"This is exactly my dilemma. Constantly mixed my meds with drugs, alcohol etc for years. I know i’m addicted to them (as much as i hate admitting that), i hate being on them. A part of me feels like i’m better than that and that i dont need them. But another part of me is scared that i do need them. I just dont want to be hooked on something for the rest of my life"
BPD,fo44i8l,t3_g5l2ci,1587498057.0,"I used the drugs as an escape to deal with my reality and my disorder.... probably made me more dysfunctional at one point, but i am almost 2 years clean now. There was a time period where I just caved in and avoided any human interaction while sobering up. Everything just hit like a tidal wave, i was emotionally unstable, having massive episodes and i was just in a dark place. I guess at the time i knew there were things i had to deal with interally, but i kept on procrastinating and chased highs instead. Felt good at the time, but even after 2 years being sober I still feel empty."
