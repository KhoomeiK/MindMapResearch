depression,f7og9ep,t3_dx2la6,1573926948.0,"I talk to my therapist weekly and I always forget how my moods where. For example one time I forgot I had been really mad ,like about to break everything in my room, and it had occurred the previous day. I have to journal my emotions or thoughts or else I will forget. But I have no motivation to write. So I either have to write my emotions done despite how much it mentally hurts or risk loosing emotional memories."
depression,f792o0p,t3_durnrx,1573501762.0,"A doctor has diagnosed me and i still struggle to accept that I’m depressed. I tell myself, “your not depressed you’re being dramatic”. I don’t remember a time where I was happy but I was happier when I didn’t know I was depressed. It’s easier for me to lie to myself and tell myself I’m fine. At some point mental pain became so common I denied my own depression."

death,f55rp7t,t1_f50ngzf,1572012613.0,Every time I failed it’s like there’s someone in my head laughing  at me saying “you idiot you can’t even kill yourself”. The minutes after the attempt hurt the most where you just sit there cry and think.

depression,f55e403,t3_dmst8i,1572005737.0,I’m young and I’m told I’m in one of the best words of my life. It’s hard to believe that when I don’t feel like I was ever meant to be alive or be here. Sometimes I think god put me here to watch me suffer. I deny my own existence I don’t think my life has the value to be acknowledged. In an emotional breakdown I will yell at “god” for putting me here when he knows I wants me at to be alive. Not feeling like I was meant to be is everyday now.

death,f50ldea,t3_dmeu95,1571929170.0,Nothing really keeps me alive. I’m only alive because my suicide attempts always fail. Being alive after a suicide attempt is one of the worst feelings I’ve ever gone through.
