Sherlock Holmes are Poirot are pretty tame if you read the books, but get wacky with every iteration (which is also annoying). And some other guy trying to manufacture an eccentric detective just for flavor is kinda nonsense. 

The mystery also doesn’t seem very interesting, the conversation where Chris Evans’ character has a conversation with Anna De Armas’ character immediately creates most of the suspicion on him.

One total cycle of 24000 yes divided into two 12000 yr cycles i.e descending and ascending cycles.

Descending satya yuga to descending kaliyuga after ascending kaliyuga to descending satya yuga .

Our Earth undergoes 24000 years of descending and ascending cycles.

Period of Earth cycles 4 YUGAS

Golden age -400 dawn + 4000+400 twilight = 4800yrs

Silver age -300 dawn+3000+300 twilight= 3600 yrs

Bronze age - 200 dawn +2000+200 twilight= 2400yrs

Devs,fl2l5n7,t3_fm519q,1584753642.0,"This is a brilliant interpretation in so many ways. Let me expand. 
“Maya” has many meanings in Sanskrit, all loosely pointing to “Illusion”, but a Vedic interpretation of ‘Māyā’ also means “illusion of reality” or “illusion of the status quo”
This is important in a few ways.
Firstly, this show is science fiction in a relatively close future and Alex Garland has drawn religious references. 

The Hindus believe that we live in the “Kali Yuga” (name of a periodic cycle of time that has 4 ‘Yugas’ in total) and each ‘Yuga’ has its signature characteristics

In Kali Yuga,
the knowledge and power of man is confined to the world of gross matter and his state or natural caste is Sudra, a menial or dependent of Nature.
During this Yuga, his mind is centered on the problems of material objectivity, the Avidya (lack of knowledge) of the Atomic Form.

Interestingly enough the next future Yuga (cycle in time) is the Dwapara Yuga, man gains a comprehension of the electrical attributes, the finer forces of nature and more subtle matters of creation. The Dwapara Yuga is also characterized by the shattering of “Māyā” which is also called Amaya :)
Where man shatters the illusion of reality."
Devs,fl1qxzk,t1_fl1deeh,1584734467.0,That’s a fair point and I get that! What I’m confused by is would you be just as motivated if you found out your partner was working for a malicious government and lied to you the whole time you’ve known them?
Devs,fl1qkdf,t1_fl1h4y7,1584734249.0,"Yes I can, and sure if the actress were switched maybe the immersion wouldn’t be broken so much but my criticism is still valid because I was questioning the motivations of the character. My title says so itself, I’m having trouble understanding the motivations and the drives of Lily Chan the character, and I find that annoying. 

This isn’t about hating female characters and your comments about me not liking the character because she happens to be female are juvenile. 
But if I must clarify I would have had the same problem if the roles were switched! 

Let’s imagine for a moment,  Lily was the Russian spy who got caught spying for a foreign government and got killed in the process and Sergei was the protagonist, I would have had the same problem because it doesn’t make sense why would someone want to commit treason or get obsessed with finding the killer. “Because she loved him” isn’t good enough reason when you find out your partner was lying and playing someone else the whole time you knew him. 


Alternatively, I would completely understand if DEVS team were doing something unethical and Sergei was a whistleblower who got murdered.. I would have even understood if lily didn’t find out Sergei was a Russian spy and that’s why she’s out for revenge. 
All I’m saying if my girlfriend was a spy for a malicious government and lied to me all her life, maybe I wouldn’t be as invested in getting revenge for her and participate in treason."

(Not that I know much about philosophy, it’s just a fun exercise to ponder on the premise of the show) 

I think the actress is bad is perfectly fair criticism. Everyone watches TV for the immersion and her acting breaks an otherwise immersive and stimulating show. 
Maybe people aren’t able to articulate WHY they feel the actress is bad? let me share my view. Remember the scene where she faked mental illness to get her friend to steal the security footage? 
When Lily started to freak out, I sorta cringed at the performance because it felt fake...but late it makes sense because she was indeed faking it! 

However after the car accident and the during her arrest, all her mannerisms and body language was very similar to the time she faked a mental illness but this time the stuff happening to her was real, so it broke the immersion and I left thinking that her performance fell in the uncanny valley. 

There’s still the directors choice... maybe lily has an ulterior motive and this will make sense in the end.. 

Or maybe she was a dancer all her life and hasn’t received much training or practice in acting."

Devs,fl1n8lg,t1_fkzrwka,1584732346.0,"My response to that would be that there are many actors who are delightful but play assholes or straight up horrible people. 
For me it’s the immersion, when the main character acts, it falls into the uncanny valley for me. Watch the 4th episode where she gets arrested, the facial expressions or the body language just doesn’t seems right and that breaks the immersion for me. 

For example I didn’t even know the person playing the boy genius Lyndon is a 23 year old woman. 
I just got lost in those characters, Stewart for example has just 10% of screen time, but we already get a rough sketch of what kind of a person he is...warm, caring, optimistic. 
Katie has very less screen time but we know (or at least for the moment comes across as) pragmatic, bold and a leader. 

Lily comes across as whiny, annoying and indecisive sometimes and bold and strong at others which is completely fine!  because that’s maybe how her character is. But the actress who plays her doesn’t have the range. 

She’s not a trained actor, neither does she have a background in it...she’s a dancer by training and profession..and she hasn’t got a lot of practice.  


There’s still hope in terms of the story requiring her to be deceptive, maybe she’s conducting an espionage operation of her own and is acting all the time. But if not, then she’s just a bad actor."
Devs,fl1cml2,t1_fl1byjc,1584726357.0,"I agree, the character Lily isn’t a great person. To me, it’s the acting that breaks the immersion.

I don’t understand the actor’s choices to portray they character that way. 

It’d would be cool if she has an ulterior motive to deceive.. maybe she’s a spy for China? Who knows. But on the surface level, if lily is supposed to be the character we see and nothing more, then I’d be very disappointed."

She’s not a trained actor, and the last role she played was literally a mute and emotionless robot (which she did well) where we couldn’t see any range. 
The whole police arrest scene was cringeworthy, I’d love to be wrong dubs want Lily Chan to have a deeper agenda which requires get to fake everything because she’s got her own ulterior motives.

He boyfriend was working for a malicious government and as any spy’s job, carries risk. In my personal opinion, he knew the risk when he became a spy and what happened to him was fair game in the domain of illegal espionage. 
And Lily knowing all this still tries to fuck up the pace of the show. 

And no offense to the actor but her acting is so bad, it’s either the part of the story we don’t know or maybe she needs some additional training because it’s breaking the immersion of an otherwise engaging show."

bestof,fgfw5mw,t1_fgfsfhb,1580748923.0,Oh Long Ball Larry is just as much as a narcissistic asshole too believe me. But he always meets these bigger morons in his journey and that makes great comedy.! Consider watching the show!

Maybe forge had some experiments gone wrong with him that left him almost dead, loba (simulacrum engineer) broke in, rescued jimmy and made him into revenant. But Hammond don’t want the bad PR so they clone/body double forge. And revenant is going about killing the doubles."

tenet,ffagj4u,t1_ff8hcsq,1579735223.0,"there was never a secret soundtrack in his movies. There have been changes to a soundtrack after the movie has been released.   
For example, the original rendition of ""one simple Idea"" (my fav in the album) isnt available in the post release album because there is a different version. but you can find it on youtube.

Similar to that was when interstellar OST came out first before the movie, it didnt have the same version for ""no time for caution"""
tenet,ffaft85,t3_es16a5,1579734740.0,"I think tenet will have just as much of a human element as Inception, Interstellar, Insomnia, The Prestige or any other Nolan film. That has always been the backbone of his movies. Even the action heavy Batman movies had tons of ""human elements"" to it. I'm sure you wont be disappointed."
tenet,feuumx0,t3_epvid4,1579390104.0,"Well said!   
Just like inception and the suitcase, it's a plot device and a visual tool used to move the story. People are reading too much into the mechanics of how the gas mask would work and I think that's a little silly. 

Did you question HOW the inception suitcase worked? HOW did the machine allow people to share dreams? NO, it required some artistic liberties and by all means let Nolan have it to tell a great original story. 

Side note: If I hear someone say ""tenet is the sequel to inception"" one more time, I'm going to loose it lol!"
