2) Others will offer more content... if you contribute substantially more than the subscription price. They call it ""tipping."" This is rather a misnomer... tipping is given freely *after* a service to show appreciation. This is the exact opposite.

3) The resolution is higher, but that benefit is crippled by the OnlyFans platform (can't download photos, can only view in a lousy display with sluggish zoom/drag).

4) The lack of downloading also means you lose content if it's removed or you unsubscribe. An artificially ephemeral product is not a good value proposition.

`gpg --edit-key 5069A233D55A0EEB174A5FC3821ACD02680D16DE`

Where the alphanumeric string is the fingerprint. Then type ""trust"" into the prompt

`gpg> trust`

You can assign trust levels from 1 to 5, 5 (""ultimately"") being the highest. Assign the trust level to 5. Press `q` to exit. All you have to do now is download your installer of choice and it's PGP signature. Use the verify command, with the signature (.sig) file as the first argument, and the file to be verified as the second argument. For example 

    gpg --verify veracrypt.tar.bz2.sig veracrypt.tar.bz2

The output should look something like this. If it says ""good signature"" from the Veracrypt key, then you're good.
