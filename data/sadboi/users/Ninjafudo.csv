My ma didnt know an ex was an alcoholic until after they were married and both in a steady place financially. 

He refused to give it up and lost it all. He CHOSE alcohol. Its a choice. It might be a hard choice. But you can empower yourself, seek help, remove temptations, find a friend or family to sponsor you and check and balance you.

Dont make the same mistake again. Gambling is about odds sure but your odds are terrible. If gambling is risky to your familys future you need to cut it out of your life. Period.

Forgive yourself for the money you lost *on the condition that you dont do it again.*

Burn that guilt into your mind. Rededicate yourself to providing a future for your kid. Maybe give them a chance but at a cheaper vocational skilled trades kind of job. Here in the states there is a high demand for plumbers electricians machinists etc.

Good luck and keep fighting the good fight."

1. They dont understand unless they themselves are equally depressed.

2. Everyone's knee-jerk reaction is to call in the authority because if they dont and you did yourself in, they would never forgive themselves and they dont want that on their mind or in the back of their mind for the rest of their lives.

3. The authorities usually cant help unless its almost too late or already too late. 
     3a. The stress of an inncident on you just makes it worse
       3b. They waste precious time that could be spent de-stressing/relaxing/sleeping/eating large amounts of ice cream or pizza  etc... Or even time spent on dealing with important duties or deadlines or responsibilities.
       3c. Authorities do not actually fix whatever the root of the problem that exists in this world..... Which is bothing you.... Their answer is always to fix yourself with drugs.

God gave mankind free will and he binds them to it. Poor choices are the reasons this world sucks. Maybe some evil persuasion as well. 

I think better things happen if you believe and pray for guidence, but even I am suffering greatly right now in the middle of a lonely and painful seperation from my wife as we try to sort out some things.

What always got me was that we exist on this planet. We didnt ask to be put here yet we are all claimed to be sinners, imperfect and unable to get to some paradise of eternity without the monopoly of salvation himself , JESUS Christ. Talk about jo  security. Make people, make them imperfect, tell then to worship you ...or else.

And instead of having the option to be like... Ok God glad you made a thing... But im not interested in eternity OR hell, so id like to cancel my subscription and have my brain box turned off and just not exist.....

Idk if that exists but i wish for it from time to time.  That would be like making par at a golf game. You dont deserve to be eternally punished. You try and you seek help frok Jesus Christ but in the end your faith is never strong enough so you settle for just not suffering forever.

idk about you but with how much i suffer in this life, im  not confident I want to live forever. That almost sounds like hell.... Maybe thats what hell is. If you live an unwise life and do not follow the guide of Christ and do not seek salvation through him, maybe yourlife becomes thw hell your spirit eve tually gets trapped in? Idk"

depression,f5lliwp,t3_do9ixo,1572280071.0,"I also feel like i have no one to talk to. (31M)

My problem is that my wife and I are seperating due to some previously under the surface stuff. 

I have cheating ocd where I constantly overthink im going to get cheated on regardless of how well she treats me. And lately some other guy is in her life. So for the past 6 months ive been overanalzingand crazy.

I broke down and spied on her phone and broke her trust. She wasnt cheating.... Is not. 

On top of that this ocd thing means i made her avoid, and persuaded  her not to do certain things, adopt certain friends, or hang out with this guy friend of hers.

She made a couple empowered female friends and finnally in the middle of a fight (on a sunday night before bed of all times) she found the courage to tell me what id been unable to see these 6 years. I have been inadvertantly controlling her with passive aggressive behavior becauee she does not or did not stand up for herself and open up about how she really fealt. 

She built up resentment and suddenly after a vaction i thought our normal problems were bandiaded...and then it exploded.

I feel like shit. Im no good and i keep failing to keep these feelings in check. She doesnt want to talk to me beyond short messages. Then she ignores them. And she is downstairs but doesnt seem to feel love for me and my heart is breaking so i cant sleep anymore and i dont know how to make the empty void go away and i have no one to talk to... Not her least of all and im not close to anyone else.... We have always been a team and kind of introverted. But the new her has like 4 friends she texts all the time  now. We are going to try counciling but i just have a feeling that her lack of love for me now is indicitive that we will not stay together?

Ugh. Im trying not to drink the alcohol next to my nightstand but i dont know how else to sleep or dull it all. I keep thinking about the other method. I cant see anything hopeful about the future.

I can understand his unwillingness to work... Taxes are bullshit and theft. Before my wife wanted seperation working was my number one compaint about life... But it has to be done. Its probabky not fair for him to ride on your hard work. But maybe you could give him an ultimatum. Tell him to set a goal. Give it a concrete time frame. Tell him if he doesnt find any job by 20xx or by a certain month... You two are seperating. And if he doesnt like that job tell him he needs to find another job BEFORE he quits that first job.

Good luck depressed penpal

Your story sounds tooooo close to my wife's. Except im the mental one wishing for death.

She moved here for me . but its been 6 years dating,  married 2.

We both have problems. 

I found out 3 or 4 days or so ago, reading a website with symptoms of ""cheating ocd"" that i have it....the kind where I obsess over images and situations in my head of my wife cheating.  I was so happy to have a name for it! Knowing your enemy is half the battle! I was so positive i could defeat it now but then she shot me down. I wanted us to hold each other again... Thats the only way i feel like i can breathe any more in  this life.... Now she is so close but so far away. 

She wants to seperate.

I always thought these thoughts were just rational possibilities i was rightfully worried like in past relationships but now i see how irratonal they are. She has always deserved my trust and faith... Buti blew her statements away.

And apparently my irrational fear caused me to try to control scary situations and reduce their frequency..... Which was only possible by demanding information i didnt know, and by being passive aggressive. I was like this with nonphysical  punishments of sorts in the form dissapointment and visibly anger fora lot of our relationship....

This made her feel controled and like she couldn't be her real self.... I didnt realize i was doing it but several people tried to warn me. I blew their statements away because i thought i could defend my reasoning easily enough.

 But now i feel like such an asshole! She resents me and doesn't want to be close. She never told me how she felt this strongly about it all. i cant escape the guilt and cant fix it. I have so much emptyness. She is downstairs and i want nothing more than to go to her but i love her and want to start listening to her desires better. Because i have not before.....

I dont know what to do either.... My room and the house is so cold now. Its no longer a home. Its a house with no warmth for my heart.

I dont know how to get over this hole in my chest. And this unbearable feeling of uselessness to change any outcome
