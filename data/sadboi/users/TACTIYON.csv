Those fins need to be D shaped as much as possible, this applies to plakats and halfmoons mostly. Unless you're raising a spade tail line, then that's different.

Anal fins are the fins below the bettas body that stretch across the bottom. Needs to be distinct and pointy.

Ventral fins are the fins in front of it sticking out, and in this betta's case, it's almost non existent and very very vague.

I'm a Singaporean looking to travel to Calgary during the period of 3 September - 15 October to visit my long distance partner whom I haven't seen for nearly 300 days. It will be nearly an added 400 days before I can see her again, leaving the grand total to 700 days.
