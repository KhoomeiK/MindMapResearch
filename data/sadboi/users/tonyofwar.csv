I'll follow back dude :D"
guitarplaying,fei39va,t1_fei2nax,1579129322.0,"The guitar is hooked up straight to my roland quad-capture and PC, the tone is made with neural dsp's archetype: abasi (great piece of software). Then I just play over the original track and adjust the levels. No more editing after that. Mainly because I don't know how to master/edit audio, and as it's only for the purpose of displaying riffs, it's good enough. 

Do you have a youtube channel where I can check out your stuff?"
guitarplaying,fehz5xg,t1_fehy0i9,1579126825.0,"Couldn't have said it better. I noticed that since that started, Manuel Fernandes (Unprocessed's guitarist) has been putting out videos of him playing with camera quality audio just to prove he can play.

It's kind of sad because it takes away from the quality. Hope this trend ends soon. It took me about a month of practice with my free time and countless takes just to get one that I thought was worth sharing. 

Thank you for supporting rather than jumping on the bandwagon!"
