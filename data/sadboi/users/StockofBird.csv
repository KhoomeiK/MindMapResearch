If you don’t want to ask your neighbor (or cops because they will laugh)for access to the backyard because you two don’t get along then I’m not sure what you can do that isn’t trespassing. I was gonna suggest you put something on the other side of the fence so the cat could use it to jump over to you or maybe a cage trap and then you could pull it over with a string but the fence is too high(got access to a ladder?)

Maybe dig a hole under the fence and leave some food or litter box out on your side so the cat can get through?"

Pets,fr3xcdw,t3_gmifjy,1589868964.0,"Kittens biting while playing is pretty normal. They would do it with other felines but she’s clearly getting to rough(maybe over stimulation from playing) or doesn’t realize her own biting strength. Either way, you could try only playing with string toys on sticks, keeping your hands and feet at a distance from her. 

When she starts biting your flesh, try firmly saying “no”(no hitting. cats don’t respond to that well or finger wagging that will just entice her) and withdrawing from her. If she tries pouncing at you or bites you again stop playing with her, moving toy away from you and ignore her. You don’t want her thinking your hands and feet are free toys. So you want her to associate that once she bites you play time no longer continues with you.

Hope that helps and hope things work out well with your new kitty."

I just love being single. I never have to worry about someone’s else’s opinion or share anything. I can sleep how I want. I don’t have to deal with anyone’s drama. The long term of romantic relationships just doesn’t out weight how happy I feel being single. 

Growing up the idea of having a partner was in the same ballpark as kids. Everyone in your life has done it so obvi you will too(realized at 16 that you don’t have to have kids). It wasn’t till after I got out of my long term relationship(I was 19 then) that I realized wow I hate being in a relationship.

He would rather move in with some other women(does his new place have space for his gym?-bs excuse honestly)then figure out changes in life to be a family with you. If uni is a big deal to him then how about, changing uni’s/online classes/long distance travel? He doesn’t want to even try and talk to you to figure out where his things could go in the home. He doesn’t even want to talk about what the future holds for you and the baby.

Sounds like he rather back burner you and the child so he can continue doing what he wants all the time. But since you said he wasn’t exactly happy about the pregnancy he’s probably avoiding moving in even harder to avoid being a father.

Why would you want to be with someone like that? You clearly care about his feelings but he really doesn’t care about yours. “Jokes” that are at the expense of someone else (specially someone you care about) are bad jokes.

Pets,fplghqx,t3_ge4z39,1588712283.0,"So thinking about it, it sounds like he’s choosing to poop outside because something is effecting him(mentally or emotionally) or it’s completely accidental and his butt keeps going over the side.

Do you clean his litter every day? Are the litter boxes covered? Are the litter boxes to small? Do you have any stray/neighbor cats roaming around your home? Has he always had these pooping mishaps? Maybe his butt hairs are causing issues?

Since he’s willing to poop in the new litter box at first maybe after that first try something unsettles him. Be it another animal or he’s being picky about the box.

I would try moving the boxes next to each other, just to see how that goes, since if he wants to poop on the floor he will. 
Also maybe try adding more litter or getting a deeper box/pan? Might not be enough for his liking to bury his poop.

He’s causing the behavior he hates and he knows he’s at fault for leaving the treats out, maybe he will grow up and change(I doubt and wouldn’t want to risk my animals lives) but watching him take my animal and choke them or beat them would disgust me.

Being calm around her and showing her you aren’t a threat, give her treats(I wouldn’t suggest getting close enough for her to bite you ) to show when you are around her good things happen.

You could try getting some activated sprayer. Some shoot out water and some shoot out air or maybe try one of those fake owls(or something scary with big eyes) that might scare it off if it thinks a predator is there. 

Not much else I can think of other than the owners keeping the cat inside at night, I have a pesky neighbor cat that stresses my cat out at night(attacked my closed window one night when my cat was sitting there) and since I can’t control how the neighbors keep their cat I just keep her out the one window it’s being a problem at."

AmItheAsshole,fo0mbcd,t1_fo033z8,1587415695.0,Thank goodness. My sister is a T1 as well so reading that your gf was weird/not letting you put your much needed insulin in the fridge was stressing me out. Hope it all works out for you.

ac_newhorizons,fn2pfgz,t3_fyyind,1586597962.0,If you want to tt back to the morning it won’t affect the event at all. Any progress you make will be saved in game even if you go back a day or a couple hours. So if you changed back to your normal time and day anything you won will be saved.

This would be a terrible decision and you can 100% back out. 

People have already said why this is bad but I’ll repeat and add some others.
The child would be legally yours if you don’t do an implant from your sisters eggs. It can take months of legal work to try and give up parental rights if you don’t go through some agency or lawyers. You would have to have physical sex with your brother in law(could be multiple times for months). Your brother-in-law could demand certain things from you during sex to “help” get you pregnant or your sister could want to be in the room to help her husband(or may even become jealous). Your brother in law could be interested in you sexually and using this as a way to get his desires. Hell he might even fall in love with you. This could also destroy your relationship with your sister. You could ruin chances for yourself of having children in the future. 
So much can go wrong. They could go through an agency to find a surrogate. The fact that full sex with your brother-in-law is required for them is bad. You aren’t bad for backing out.

Pets,flzopyu,t3_fs46wb,1585629075.0,"Pets are normally seen as property in the states. So unless this guy took the cat into his home and got the cat chipped with his information and paid for veterinary care he really doesn’t have much to stand on.

 Like you said you didn’t take the cat off his property, you didn’t break into his home. So in my nonlawyer opinion he has no claim over the cat since he doesn’t sound like he did anything but feed the cat occasionally or pet it a few times. Even if police did get involved they would need evidence of a crime(like trespassing or breaking and entering) and since you have photos and vet care proof I believe police would just leave you alone and say it’s a civil matter."
vancouverwa,flt0eoh,t1_flsxrhg,1585455593.0,"The stock isn’t too bad, I was able to get everything that I needed this time. If you are looking for paper towels or tp, they had no tp stock at like 3pm when I went and only had a few rolls of their paper towels and some bounty left over. It seems like if you want anything like flour or tp you will have to arrive much earlier. They still had a good stock of bread, meat and eggs when I was there, things like bacon and hot dogs were pretty bare tho. They seem to do pretty well keeping everything stocked up."

I encountered a man and women(they weren’t together)in winco a few days ago who did not think this was at all necessary and completely ignoring social distancing while standing in line and openly talking about how people need to stop worrying."
WTF,flroje6,t1_flrdy2n,1585424507.0,I never saw the movie as a child and only saw the commercials so that turtle scene was super funny to me. I was so disappointed as an adult when I actually watched the movie and realized the movie was nothing like that scene.
