hoarding,fr5dwsz,t3_gmkrxf,1589906961.0,"It took a while, but I eventually learned that even if I actually throw away something I need one day, I will be OK.  If it’s a document, it can likely be replaced.  If it’s a photo, either the image is forever in my memory or I didn’t know I had it in the first place, so I would never know the difference if I threw it out.  If it’s an item, I’d be using or displaying it if I actually felt I needed it, and if it’s a thing I’d use once in a while, I can get a similar one when I need it.  

It’s tempting, but I would highly suggest NOT going through the bags.  You have to learn to trust yourself.  You decided at some point that whatever’s in the bags is garbage.  Just go with it.  Right now, you are ok and have everything you need.  The same goes for tomorrow.  If there was anything in those bags you needed, you’d be using it.
