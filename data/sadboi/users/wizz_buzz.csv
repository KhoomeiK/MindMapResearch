Then Iâ€™ll head to my bedroom and set up my bed (have particular way of doing it depending on the temp). 

After this I take a shower and listen to my audio book (I have fairy lights on rather than the main light to try and reduce exposure to light). 

Once Iâ€™m done I get a treat for my dog and fill up their water bowl. 

Then I go into my bedroom and turn off main lights and put on night lights. I put on my face creams, spray my room with lavender and get into bed. 

In bed I write out three priorities for the best day, plus any other reminders I can think of. After this I write a list of things I acknowledge I did that day/that I feel grateful for. Then I play more wizards unite/ look up Harry Potter stuff. After this I set my alarm. 

I go to the toilet one more time and then head back to bed and off to sleep/ just lay and rest if I canâ€™t sleep! 

This has really supported me, but it really didnâ€™t support me when I tried to enforce set times to do this, it made me a tonne more anxious and pressurised - instead I have a rough guideline time but I know I donâ€™t always stick to it and thatâ€™s okay!"

science,et1ytpr,t3_c9lnfq,1562407147.0,"Why is neurodiverse research so misfocused. This is not new information, adhd brains are in constant search for stimulation, hence difficulty focusing, fidgeting and so on. Adhd brains have different motivations, such as extremes, urgency, passion etc as opposed to delayed consequence etc. Due to needing such a high level of stimulation, sex is an clear place to reach that. This is nothing new, however itâ€™s also misplaced in that it of course â€˜mayâ€™ lead to that at higher rates than NTs, however thatâ€™s obvs not a given. Also, due to the different need for stimulation, we must take into account if weâ€™re comparing the level of sexuality to neurotypicals, rather than other adhd people. A big majority of adhd activities could be considered â€˜hyperâ€™ from a neurotypical perspective, what really needs to be considered is sexuality amongst adhd people. Neurotypical is not the neurology from which neurodivergent people are defective, itâ€™s merely a difference so research that continually examines the difference as problematic/defective, claiming neurotypical brains to be the only â€˜correctâ€™ functioning is very demeaning. Itâ€™s creating an automatic assumption that one neurology as superior, and everything must be compared to that, if the comparison sees a difference that that thing is automatically inferior and wrong. Of course this is not true, neurodiverse people are just neurologically our numbered - so when doing adhd or any neurodiverse research for that matter, please can we consider the importance of comparing this to other people with adhd."
science,esp8eyl,t3_c8n59d,1562180461.0,"Weightloss needs to be tracked over a longer period, at least 3 years to be classed as maintained. 95% of people who go on restrictive diets and rigid exercise routines resulting in  weight loss do not sustain this when you look beyond a year. People with eating disorders are very good at exercising at exactly the same time - why isnâ€™t this considered? Framed in this way, treatment would suggest its prioritisation of habits to induce weight loss leads to further rigid habits in other parts of life, that can be obsessive, leading to an overwhelming sense of control as well as anxiety when missed. This paper needs to account/screen for eating disorders to be consider viable."

The thing thatâ€™s been by far the most helpful over the last few years is giving up attempts at control over trying to stop of the need to feel in control. I have found acceptance of where Iâ€™m at in each moment really beneficial, using daily mindfulness practices to help me cultivate this more accepting attitude. Itâ€™s hard cos some days I feel like I really canâ€™t do the things I need/want to do but the more I fight it, the harder it gets to do these things. Accepting that â€˜right now, itâ€™s like thisâ€™ has let me tolerate the times where things seem impossible and bounces me back into action much quicker and more level headed than when I tried to push away the PDA stuff.

aspergers,eplegon,t3_bv2hox,1559293840.0,"This type of comment on empathy grates me. I feel empathy, my family say I am the most sensitive and empathetic person among us. 

&#x200B;

When autistic people are termed as lacking empathy please remember this is mostly referring to lacking ability to connect and empathise with the neurotypical experience. This subreddit is a super example of this, we all take to here when something happens that we think we can share and relate to among others who are also autistic - that is a form of strong connection and empathy.

&#x200B;

In the UK, the main charity for autism don't actually refer to autistic people as 'lacking empathy' so singularly anymore, they instead use the concept of the 'double empathy bind'. This is the idea that neurotypicals find it extremely challenging to empathise with people on the spectrum and vice versa. This is because DIFFERENT types of neurology find it hard to empathise with different types of neurology. 

&#x200B;

Also, as autistic people our emotions present differently from how we may have seen or learnt of the majorities presentation of emotions. This means, whilst others can use social info to work out what their own emotions are, we may not have access to that secondary path learning. An example of this is I often laugh when I am intensely sad mixed with confusion, I thought this meant I was insincere or not actually sad as I had a very clear idea this wasn't common, but learning to sh my self doubt, I really have come to accept this is the way my sadness mixed with confusion presents. Now, I have been called unempathetic for this presentation, but I am still feeling - it's just not communicated in a way that lets an NT readily see what it is I am feeling"
