I see patriotism as acknowledging that this is where you live, and it's your job to fight to make it the best for everyone else living there with you. I see it as being proud of progress, but never allowing yourself to be satisfied when there are people being oppressed or who are disadvantaged. It's knowing that perfection is impossible but always striving to be better. It's striving not for equality, but for equity, making sure everyone has as fair of a starting point as possible so that success depends on effort, not race or economic class."

In middle school I waited and waited for my face to break out and it never did. That was something I was legitimately upset about for awhile. To this day I still think acne looks cool.

 I graduated high school two years ago and while I don't exactly want to go back, it's going to be a breath of fresh air for you. These assholes will still be there but you'll be spaced out and and an amazing phenomenon happens when you enter high school. Suddenly all the cocky 8th graders are squishy little freshmen. And they start to shape up. There's a new world to get to know and stuff like that from middle school becomes boring. I have bipolar disorder (type 1, the most severe.) I've been stable and doing really well for awhile now, but when I was 13 I had a manic episode that lasted almost the whole year. I thought I could fly. I would not shut up. I hallucinated shit. People thought I was crazy, and technically I was. When I came out of the episode towards the end of the year I realized what I had made of myself and was sure I'd never recover from it. The first day of highschool, it was over. A lot of people from my middle school weren't really actively trying to talk to me, but no one ever said a word about it again, at least to my face. If kids can get bored with the weeb who saw things, they can definitely get bored with your emetophobia. 
I wish I could give you more help than to tell you to hold on and wait, but kids are assholes and when you ask them to stop something they'll do it more. However, the best news I have for you is that unbeknownst to them, these bullies are helping you out in the best way possible. This is your first session in exposure therapy. The more they do this, the more desensitized you'll become to it. First it's being able to tolerate stupid classmates imitating it. And then, you're going to want to push yourself more. A few years ago I started listening to people v*ing on YouTube. Then, I started watching it. It's awful. It takes time and discipline. You just have to tell yourself over and over and over that nothing is hurting you. But now, I can see it on TV. You have the strength in you to take this. Right now, worry about keeping your cool when they pull that crap. Focus on how much of a dirtbag they are. Eventually, you'll become desensitized to it. When all of this started for me I wouldn't eat anything. If the girl who grew up drinking pediasure for all of her nutrients can make it, you can too. You WILL make it out of this and nothing will harm you along the way. Feel free to message me as well."
