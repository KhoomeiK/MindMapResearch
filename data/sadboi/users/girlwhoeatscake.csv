I felt super lost without that crutch. I would panic before bed and overestimate everything I was eating. 


Eventually it became super normal and I stopped worrying too much about calories, and managed to lose weight at a much slower pace. 


However, I also started purging more when I realized I ate something that definitely was not a safe food, or was definitely more calories than I needed. I’d sometimes even purge after a normal meal. 


Recently I started heavy restricting again but without counting and it’s a great/weird feeling. Part of the obsession of creating and recreating meals throughout the day is gone, but I’m still super into my eating disorder at the moment. 


Overall, not sure if any of this is helpful, but not counting calories saved me. Truly. There’s been a learning curve for sure, and even though my anxiety and depression are manifesting through my eating disorder at the moment, I swear that not worrying about the calories is the most freeing thing."

fatlogic,ewa1052,t3_cnfq55,1565234594.0,"So perhaps the textbook definition of anorexia does include underweight; however, individuals who are not underweight can still partake in restricting beyond safe levels. I know because I was someone who got down to a healthy size by eating 900 kcal a day for 9 months. I lost my hair, I was tired, I was angry, and I was not healthy. My compulsive eating manifested into compulsive restricting, and while I never once was diagnosed with anorexia, I portrayed all of the behaviors with the exception of being thin. 


While I don’t think this was intended to be offensive, for individuals suffering with eating disorders, as I still am, Bulimic, but not underweight, this kind of content is triggering and unhelpful. Overweight, normal weight, and underweight individuals can be ignored for the manifestation of their eating disorders. I know. I am one of them 


I may get a lot of backlash for this, but I am tired of everyone thinking overweight and normal weight individuals aren’t valid in their disorders. It took me a long time to admit I had an eating disorder, and this commentary isn’t helpful."
