supper interesting different aspects of medicine."
premed,ex3wkxz,t3_cn8o4s,1565993099.0,Just email AACOMAS and let them know. You have to provide a course description from your schools catalog with an explanation why it needs to be counted as English
premed,ex3jm83,t1_ex33np4,1565986605.0,"some of the DO schools screen based on sGPA . Some want both the cGPA and sGPA to be above 3.00.  AACOMAS miscalculated my sGPA bellow a 3.00 by not accounting for some science classes I had taken. I had to email and get it fixed. I got rejected for secondaries from the schools because my sGPA did not meet the requirement even though my MCAT and cGPA did.  After my sGPA was recalcualted I received secondaries from the school.  I don't know if taking online science classes UNE is helpful or not for your application, but that could be a way to boost your sGPA. I have not taken classes from them, i've just seen this discussed on here and other forums.

Good luck on your MCAT! As one music buddy to another, there is a lot you can do with music and psychiatry. If your fine with large classes and overpriced ice cream, then also consider the Caribbean. But the cost of the Caribbean is super super-pricey. If your willing to go to Caribbean, what about international medical schools? (have not looked into this either)"

Okay will do thank you"
Mcat,ew4xguy,t1_ew4wt7w,1565120664.0,Not as prerequisite! I already took those and did well except too and retook those and did well. I was like nutrition and other science courses
