Antipsychiatry,fqzbn5t,t1_fqsviyw,1589763978.0,"Yeah, short-term psych wards are primarily ""crisis stabilization"", not for any long term treatment or in-depth stuff, and I obviously get that...... except when it comes to the fact that snap judgements with no nuance made in these places can affect you for the rest of your life.

If they decide you have xyz illness based on a 2 second assessment (or even based on nothing at all), look into it no further, and give you a med that interacts horribly with you...... you could end up with after effects of that Forever, or be put in a position where you want off the meds, but whoever you go to after the hospital is convinced you MUST need them/MUST have xyz illness, because The Hospital Said So, And They Cant Be Wrong. 

And if the hospital diagnoses with someone, like say, psychosis, with no basis and no real assessment, that diagnosis can haunt you, and bar you from desperately needed resources. Other doctors will read that diagnosis and decide to never believe you about anything. Housing programs will ban you before even meeting you because that diagnosis makes you a 'risk' or whatever.

Not to mention how stupid the system is of 'stabilizing' people for like, a couple days, and then tossing them back out into their previous circunstances with little to no guidence, aftercare, consideration for surrounding circumstances......... and even that 'stabilization' is often nothing more than sedation, while inside the person is just as bad as before. 

And don't even get me started on active patient abuse and medical trauma that happens in those facilities. More than people realize.

The idea of ""well, we're/they're just a short term place to stabilize, you cqnt expect real assessment or treatment"" distracts from the point that maybe these places should be more than that then, that the way these places function can be far more detremental than helpful and can have long-term consequences, and that even if we held them to the simple goal of 'stabilizing' people and nothing else, they often fail at even that much."

Hit the nail on the head. That's EXACTLY something I see again, and again, and again. I see this with both medical doctors/nurses/ect *and* psychiatric doctors/nurses/ect, but it's a lot worse with the psych ones. 

So often they just cannot accept that they might be wrong about something, or misunderstood, or could be miseducated, ect, and they'll go to any lengths to discount the possibility of it. Imagining made up threats or danger from you, spinning Any resistance/criticism as ""proof"" that you're ""in denial"" or ""simply defiant to be defiant"", spinning anything even slightly ""off"" about you as ""proof"" that they're right to force you to do things or right that you're ""unstable""........

(personal example, once went to a clinic for a PHYSICAL issue, got sectioned for *7 days* because of my unrelated mental health history and my easily explainable behaviour with obvious causes. Apparently I was ""clearly unstable"" because I paced around a lot. I'm an active runner, was bored out of my mind, and also had restless leg syndrome as a result of the physical illness I was suffering. wtf)

And with psych doctors specifically it's so easy for them to do this stuff. They can basically do whatever they want, say whatever they want, claim whatever they want about you, and if you protest or complain or seek outside help, they can just say ""well, this person is crazy because i say so"" and bam, suddenly no one believes you and you have no rights, no recourse. It's dangerous, it's bullshit, it's traumatzing, it's stupid, and it's a huge mess. A huge mess that actively draws in the worst types of people on top of it all, draws in ""bullies"" and abusers actively looking to EXPLOIT that power over people."

Food has been an extremely contentious topic my entire life, and has brought me a lot of pain. People screaming at my mother that she's ""spoiling me"" by cooking me meals I could eat (and even then, I ended up malnourished in the end), plenty of mockery of my eating habits sprinkled in there, lots of deep shame and embarrassment, and then a year of homeless where I was literally starved.........

That may not seem relevant to this situation, and I'm unsure of the severity of your girlfriend's pickiness...... she might have ARFID, she might have some condition like I do, she might be a super taster......... or, maybe not, and she is just ""picky"". My point is, there is truly nothing fun about being a ""picky"" eater, it brings a lot of shame with it, and you feel you miss out on So Much......... one thing including having people enjoy cooking for you. 

I understand that you're not enjoying cooking for her, that it's not the way you want to cook, and her ""pickiness"" frustrates you....... and tbh I get it,, I do. But I would ask that you try to think of it from a different perspective........ and to also communicate with her about both your feelings and her OWN feelings on her ""pickiness""/your cooking for her, without saying she has the ""tastebuds of a 5 year old"". 

Y'know what, maybe she truly is just picky, and she has no shame, and she doesn't see your cooking as the gift it is but as an obligation........ but skip the insult, and Talk to her about her perspective on this first. You would not be the asshole is you stopped cooking for her, and you're not an asshole for being frustrated, but YWBTA if you stopped because she ""has the tastebuds of a 5 year old"" without first talking to her about her own perspective on her ""pickiness"" and your cooking for her."

It took a few months for all the symptoms left over from these drugs to finally vanish. To be fair, I was lucky to only be on them for a little while, and my particular symptoms were very quantifiable and easy to tell when they went away, so..... YMMV.

Mental illness is when your brain is built to function in a certain way, designed to function is a certain way, but something went wrong with the wiring, with chemicals, from injury ect that has caused it to function differently (usually in a detremental way). Neurodivergency is when your brain is Designed to function a certain way, and does so, but the way it is designed to function is ""different"" from the norm. 

I have a deep, burning hatred of my autism, but my brain IS functioning how it was made to, at least in that respect. And nothing can ever change it. And to be fair, a lot of the issues that come from autism are actually only ""issues"" because of the society/enviornment we live in, and would have even been advantages in older times.

The consistent thing though is that it lasts much longer. Poli is basically extended release HBr, so the effects come on slower, and take much longer to fade away. You should be able to reach the same sort of 'peak' as HBr, but it may feel different because of how the come up to reach there is stretched out. At least, it feels different for me.

Experiment some to get a gauge on how it effects you and how much you like it compared to HBr. For me it's best when mixed with HBr at about a 1:3 ratio. Strong peak, long-lasting 'peak', and extremely long come down and afterglow."

They don't want to help, or really *talk* to you, or help you figure out the root of your problems, they just want to throw meds at you until you're ""stable"" (or sedated into non-functionality) and then wash their hands of you.

And despite working almost exclusively with poor people, they are very dismissive of the trauma/anxiety caused by extreme poverty. Last time I went in, the psychiatrist saw I was anxious and insisted on me taking anxiety meds, that I ""needed"" them, and when I explained I was anxious specifically because I was job hunting and in extreme poverty, she dismissed me with a ""oh, thats not a big deal"".

She was accompanied 24/7, had a room with nothing in it, and when she would 'act out' in any way, she would be tackled to the ground, dragged through the halls, and strapped into restraint chair. Whenever this would happen the nurses would laugh or scoff, about how ""she's doing it for attention, ugh, she needs to go home to her mama, stupid babies like that need to go home to mama"".......... she'd apparently been there for Years. What mama? How can she leave if she's locked in here anyway?

[CW: sexual assault] A guy on the men's ward was getting up at night, walking right past the nurse's station, and going in the womens' rooms to masturbate over them.

The husband because no matter the reason and the extreme difficulty of coming out, he shouldn't have gotten married, or should have revealed it to her in private and had a serious talk, instead of trying to keep up this charade and string your step sister along. 

You, for not saying anything to your step sister when you should've known what a huge impact this secret would have on her, and known that she was being strung along. 

Your step sister, somewhat, because while the shock is extremely understandable, and so is the anger, she probably should not have publically outed him on facebook, and it would have been better if she'd instead vented privately and waited until they could both have a serious conversation, uninvolved with other people, before bringing them into it.

That secret was gonna come out eventually, it had too, and honestly it's good that it did. I sympathize heavily with not wanting to be out, with the fear, but your poor step sister was trapped in a loveless marriage, being lied to, having no idea who her husband really was. 

~~Also you left it unclear whether the husband was sleeping with anyone behind her back..... and if he was, and you KNEW about it, I'm sorry but the both of you are HUGE assholes. In that case, he was also cheating on her, and could possibly have infected her with something is he wasn't having safe sex.

I've known a handful of people now that acted exactly like this; being super into LGBT culture despite being ""straight"", claiming they're straight and just want to ""be included"" when confronted, being as ambiguous as possible in order to be treated/thought of as an LGBT person without having to explicitly say it..... I've even had an acquaintance say she thought going down on a girl was ""gross"", and then realize she was bisexual years later.

Your sister might be LGBT and in denial, convincing herself that she's just ""super into"" LGBT culture, and trying to have others think of her as LGBT without having to think of Herself as such or examine why she wants that. OR she could be insensitive and using LGBT culuture as dress-up and basking in the attention. It really could be either.

YTA...... tentatively? I don't know. I understand your frustration, but maybe it wasn't a good idea to call her out publically....... but if she's really just using the culture/vague language to garner attention for herself, maybe it's better you did...... but then again, it might just make her more defensive and unwilling to sort her shit out either way, and also if she does turn out to be LGBT and trying to figure it out, that ""call out"" was not a good move...... but then again......... ;;"
