Everyone else has already brought up a bunch of good points but I'll add one I didn't see. You seem to have a good relationship with your doctor. If in any way your doctor gets tied up in this where he can't deny he knew he can lose his license. The DEA and medical board don't mess around. I assume he has permissions to write suboxone, vivitrol, etc for substance abuse these take additional permissions and audits. Him not knowing about a potentially shady nurse who may steal a pad to write for opiods/narcotics/etc could put his practice at risk.

I think you're right. Focus on your symptoms and how to feel better. If diagnoses follow let the doctors deal with that. Having a label doesn't let you wake up happy and symptom free but learning how to deal with your own unique brain does.

I know the Dave Ramsey method and trust me he is NOT following it and neither are you. It's great the debts being paid but he is not learning shit. Why? He still get what he wants. He's not sacrificing. No one really sacrificing to pay off debt is driving an expensive car and adding to their debt and you know this. 

As soon as it's paid off he's bringing it back because if he can pay if off once he can do it again!"

I start by shorting my hand as much as I can into the 'crappiest' routes I can - the low point ones no one wants and I never look at them again. Remember any routes in your hand you don't complete go against you.

I build all the long tracks asap even doubles, making everyone else get creative on their routes. Then I purposely take small strategic tracks blocking them and making them block each other.

Since I'm not working on routes I don't care if my trains connect, it's literally a sabotage game. The points from trains and few negative routes with lots of negatives on opponents means it almost always wins.

Did play against someone who knew my strategy and it was half fun. They were sabotaging my sabotage. Build train in line, oh no someone is in my line is just boring to me but I know it's a super popular game so I try to just abstain from it to NOT ruin people loving little trains."

AmItheAsshole,fogux4d,t1_fogjl7a,1587757254.0,Yeah I would have just sat and shot the shit.

Not to look a gift NTA in the mouth."

BipolarReddit,foe30kn,t3_g6zco8,1587695017.0,"Two things and I'll try to keep it short. 

1. For your meds. YOU call your doctor. First never be complacent relying on other people when it comes to your health, even professionals. Secondly for whatever reason some doctors respond better to patients calling them then pharmacies ESPECIALLY if it's a med that was previously written by a specialist.

How do I know this? Leads me to point two. I'm a pharmacy tech. 

2. Don't think essential workers are better than non. Sure we have 'essential' functions but at the end of the day we are slaves too. Being treated like shit, usually for shit pay, long hours and neglected too. I was yelled at for over 10 minutes today by a doctor because it's 'not my job to check doses I'm just supposed to dispense what's written' and her script was 'perfectly fine'. Dumb bitch didn't know difference between ml and mg and was asking for 10x the dose the patient needed and BTW making sure a dose is safe is EXACTLY a pharmacies job otherwise doctors could dispense directly and just kill people. No I'm not paid awesome. I get seizures from the stress from my job. You are no less important than essential workers like me, the check out girl at the grocery store or even that asshole doctor."

At the moment I'm helping another team which requires a few phone calls to patients, my team never talks or sees patients, but even when I worked on this team I've only had one bad experience with a specialty patient and it was understandable. A different world than retail.

Doctors/ nurses/ receptionists can be assholes in all worlds as far as I can tell."
AmItheAsshole,fo5dxii,t3_g5ncns,1587523338.0,"NTA but in my experience when asking for disability accommodations you need proof of disability and how accommodation is applicable. Normally this is to discourage what your friend is talking about, people taking advantage of the system, or people lying about disabilities. You said you're not in treatment so you have no one to back you up that relocation would aggravate your OCD. Talk to your manager and see if you need to get into therapy."

We also bought a pizza.

BipolarReddit,fnsha9w,t1_fnr6ice,1587221596.0,Like the other person said take it before bed and see if that helps. I take mine literally right before I climb into bed. If I stay awake through its initial sleepy feelings for whatever reason like my husband talking to me I will stay up. Not tried eating with it personally so can't speak to that but taking it at bedtime may help. You don't need to eat with this medication.

He sucks for needing to be asked 4 times but maybe he's learning too and he sounds like maybe he was talking/arguing and not intentionally triggering you so yes he needs to LEARN too.

You suck because you need to learn impulse control.

This from someone with PTSD who used to throw shit all the time. You are both learning. Don't blame him for not automatically picking up on your triggers if you're just now figuring them out and you live with them it's of course going to take him time to figure out how to approach things. 

As for who to clean. Stupid question. YOU. You throw something, you clean it. Be an adult. Just because you're sick doesn't mean you're blameless. Take responsibility for your actions. It's how you heal. 

Good luck."

Don't give her the satisfaction of jealousy or anger, don't lower yourself to insults and most importantly MOVE ON - don't let her pettiness stick to you for any longer than it takes to finish the call.
