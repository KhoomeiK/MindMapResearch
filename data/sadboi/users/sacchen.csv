suboxone,fqc9ep8,t1_fjyurkq,1589252919.0,"I would consider taking magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) daily. It's helped me tremendously with constatation, and maybe a bit with GERD while using both kratom and subs.

Most people (purportedly) are deficient in magnesium due to soil depletion so we get less of it in our food than we used to.

Magnesium citrate tastes better and is more bioavailable iirc, and I just generally prefer it, but costs more per dose.

I take roughly 5 grams (about a tablespoon) a day, which contains 500mgs of elemental magnesium. I take more, and up to about 20-30 grams if I'm actively constipated, just make sure to drink a ton of water with it when your ass becomes a fire hose.

It also helps relax my muscles a lot and makes RLS and any kind of withdrawal much more bearable for some reason.

Oh yeah, and it also seemed to have a positive effect on my depression when it was ***really bad.***

It's cheap and easy, so try it out! Maybe consult your doctor, but it's pretty hard to get hypermagnesia (too much unexcreted magnesium), though if your organs are becoming less efficient it could *maybe* be something to keep in mind.

I heard car tires moving on the pavement outside over and over again, different sirens, radio chatter, and it's like I could see the room I was in, and somehow the hallway too but it was all weirdly warped and borderline incomprehensible. I was fucking *TERRIFIED*, trying to figure out what was going on. Woke up and suddenly all was still, pretty quiet, sort of ""looked different"" as if I came back from a slightly different version of reality, and as I slowly woke, i eventually crept around trying to be quiet and look around.

Everything was fine and ""normal"" but I was still mega sketched out.

Plus, I still remember when I was practically a baby, I would fall asleep looking at a fan above me and I would gradually get tunnel vision with the fan in the center and it would morph into something like a face. The most terrifying part was that, (iirc I was like 3-5 at the time), it would speak directly to me in a garbled, very deep and gravelly voice in a language I didn't know, speaking directly to me, it was fucking crazy. That was the most common one as a kid. Demons, basically, whispering dark secrets to me, a small human child.

It happened with pretty much the same template when I was in a swing set with a little seat I was hooked into, facing my house and the woods behind me. There a highway past the woods so there's usually whooshing noise. So instead of a fan, the woods turned into something dark and demonic and spoke to me then.

Hasn't happened much since I've gotten older, but I still have fucking nutzo crazy dreams pretty often.

science,fnzzgfx,t1_fnzktah,1587403426.0,"Well, depending on how it's prepared, it will vary in bioavailability and composition, but it will almost likely be more potent per mg than smoking for a number of reasons. 

You're not degrading cannabinoids into other stuff/destroying them, there's no smoke floating off with wasted cannabinoids, and your GI tract is more efficient in absorbing all the cannabinoids and terpenes. IIRC, THIS IS largely because it moves pretty slowly and that longer duration of contact with blood vessels allows for better bioavailability.

However, you also have to contend with first-pass metabolism (occurs before the which also iirc, involves moving drugs through the portal vein to the liver where they are metabolized into other chemicals. Supposedly, you can bypass this a little by, say, eating a small snack so first-pass metabolism is a little less efficient and more goes to second pass where the mostly unaltered cannabinoids can get into your bloodstream, and travel about to activate CB1 & CB2 receptors in your body and brain. Of course you have to make sure it's only a small snack, otherwise it's liable to be diluted by the food, and not absorb as rapidly/efficiently.

Part of the issue with edibles too is that they *can* be unpredictable, especially for beginners. I've had times when I thought I made something really strong that was actually pretty mild, and times where I had only a sliver of edible and I got absurdly baked and could only sleep in this weird quasi-psychedelic twilight. It sucked.

An empty or most empty stomach is ideal for edibles, especially when you're learning to titrate, i.e. figure out your dose.

Edibles also feel a bit ""heavier"" than smoking it, and maybe that's from a better absorption of CBD relative to the THC and the more sedative cannabinoids, or perhaps just a bigger, more bioavailable dose, I'm not sure. My bet's on the latter though.

They can also take longer to kick in, but that's variable too. I've noticed an average of 1.5-3 hours for them to kick in, but there's been times when it took 8+, and a few times where I ate a weed-nuttella smore first thing in the morning and I felt pretty high after only like 15-20 minutes 

Smoking also involves a lot of burning plant material, which while less carcinogenic than cigarettes, is still definitely not ideal or healthy.

Edibles and cannabis-infused drinks also have the advantage of being really delicious, especially when done right. If you don't like the spicy/earthy taste you can water cure the herb and get quite a lot of the taste/smell out of it. The smoke is nearly flavorless too (you know, besides smoke that is). The only problem with water curing is that you run the risk of developing mold if done poorly.

(Btw, try bhang sometime, make it yourself of possible - it's an sweet, creamy, milky Indian weed smoothie type thing, and it's actually awesome even without the weed; also just throwing cannabutter into some turkey stuffing is surprisingly tasty - the spices and the weed flavor go together surprisingly well. Same thing with chocolate and chocolate/strawberry ice cream. Straight delicious.)

I'm absolutely loving it! I've had more than a few days where I got nearly hypomanic because I was so damn excited and proud that I was finally learning programming, feeling normal, and just being productive. I sleep like a fucking log, and when I wake up I'm actually groggy. When I was on kratom, I would wake up edgy, nose runny, sore, ""too awake"", and just generally miserable. Of course that is only when I *do* sleep, and am not enmeshed in learning ""one last thing""  - sound familiar? It's almost as if since my brain's craving for sweet, sweet numbing opioids has been replaced by a cravings for the things I already loved doing before I got addicted. It's kinda fucking awesome to get excited about an idea and then actually have the energy to pursue it, instead of barely being able to keep up and then giving up, leaving me feeling like a hollow husk of myself. I'm still having ups and downs, and my sleep (which has always been insane, probably non-24 or something) being unpredictable has made it nigh-impossible to do normal people stuff at normal people times, and my ability to keep appointments bc of is is just atrocious, but that's a fine trade-off. And honestly, that's a problem that I had before I was an addict so maybe that's just me.

In short - my life has gotten so much better than it was, I feel *substantially* less suffering than I did before, and it's has been so ***UNSPEAKABLY NICE*** to have a chance to live my life the way I actually want to, instead of being dragged down by my kratom-altered neurochemistry.

Low-dose, responsible kratom use is nice, but high daily doses while addicted are fucking hellish.
