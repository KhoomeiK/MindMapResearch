LifeAdvice,fikeh0a,t3_f879ld,1582478827.0,"You shouldn‚Äôt have a problem getting hired at fast food places, restaurants as servers or retirement places as well, go to grocery stores even sometimes little mini marts will allow you to work for them 21 or not. So it‚Äôs kinda all what you want to do and get into. I suggest finding something with customer service. Because that‚Äôs something all places are looking for. Just you being able to talk to customers and either help them or solve solutions to the problems they have. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find something. The tip I have is stay at this first job for awhile just to show you can keep a job ,and follow rules, and work with a schedule. It shows you are able and capable of working, also if you don‚Äôt get a call back, either go in or call them and ask what the status is on your application it shows them that you are eager to start working. Most places like that."
