Clearly- posting it is a signal that it was very important to you. Once you get into a safe place- I would work on the courage to confront them. If you have BP, you need to be kind with yourself. This is an emotional attachment to your childhood. It‚Äôs a memory that‚Äôs significant and meaningful. Nobody can say that your parents purposefully recorded over your speech with the intention of being selfish.

I believe that all therapist have their modality to supporting and helping clients. You might need a different person, but equally consider that they have your best interest at heart. It‚Äôs trust and respect that therapy is built upon and if you don‚Äôt feel those aspects are being met for you, you might need someone else."

Best thing is to ask her way she did it and if it‚Äôs getting her the results that she wanted. It‚Äôs not healthy for relationships to cheat and it hurts the trust for you.

therapy,fnl93fl,t1_fnl21gc,1587049327.0,I might place some boundaries with her on the matter. Like make a schedule for yourself and what you need and let her know your schedule for self-care.

I recognize you‚Äôre juggling many thoughts and concerns in that post, but it‚Äôs going to destroy you if you try and solve all of it at once. I think that you taking inventory of your addictive habits is a great first-step. Clearly, you want to change and you need to work towards something healthy. Maybe take on a hobby or passion or something that makes you feel fulfilled through meaningfulness. Exercise is always a great way to redirect poor behavior or an activity that you can share with other. I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt super helpful but usually the best way to go is one step at a time and accept that not everything will go perfect.

I do hope that you find a better, healthier way to handle your anger. My suggestion is notice any changes leading towards the anger- feelings, thoughts, and Physical. Once you recognize those triggers- you will have to routinely remove yourself back into a calm state. Deep breathing exercisers has shown to lower stress and place us into a state of relaxation. Controlling anger takes tremendous effort and I applaud you doing that."

TwoXChromosomes,fmwjah3,t1_fmvutq7,1586447592.0,"Ah- that 3rd option makes sense. I have little hope that would work. Although the person is suppose to be a registered sex offender in their state, it doesn‚Äôt prevent them from doing such a crime. New York or some state just ended an absolute sex offender list that lasted the lifetime of the offenders, yet it was found to not be helpful, so if there‚Äôs a third option, it needs to be comprehensive. The problem is that rape cases are handled poorly or mismanaged. It‚Äôs a three step-system at least- victim, community, and rapist. All these need to be addressed. Nobody can trust the offender, the victims usually have serious trauma, and the community is harmed. It‚Äôs such a complexed issue that it needs to be comprehensive action to resolve the matter."
TwoXChromosomes,fmvs9e3,t3_fxk5bd,1586428946.0,"Honestly- our justice system is backwards with crime and punishment. It usually doesn‚Äôt hold water to these cases. Often times- laws are written to protect crimes or maintain status quo. The United States is the only country that incarcerates men faster for drug crimes than any other country. Our sentencing for punitive crimes is up and our sentencing for serious crimes are down and usually without substance. We have enough people in prison and jails to start another country. Although we have this occurrence, crime hasn‚Äôt fallen and things are worse than before. We still have rape and assault in communities. It‚Äôs a question of suffering and punishment and if the judicial system is meeting that requirement. It‚Äôs money and it‚Äôs always been a major problem in guiding the hand of justice."
psychotherapy,fmvrhij,t3_fxmu7x,1586428100.0,"I would explain to minors that they had confidentiality unless there where a few legal circumstances that required me to break it. I would always affirm with invasive parents that seasons where confidential and that if it was legally necessary, I would have to let them and the proper agencies know it, too. If parents persisted they have rights to know, I would show them the binding confidentiality laws with clients. If that didn‚Äôt work- and they still persisted- I might say ‚Äúyou care and need to know that your child is well cared for during their time with me. My job is provided a safe and comfortable place for them to share how they are doing. If you can trust me, and allow me to honor their privacy, it will make the healing process better for them‚Äù. Usually, this is my variation with disarming them. However- if they still persist- and they might, I would inform them as you mentioned, that it would be completely on the client to release information and they would need to work towards it."
mentalhealth,fmgxktl,t1_fmgr9hl,1586060579.0,"The goal of suffering would be to integrate that experience and find meaning in it. Depression is a common phenomenon for many and the aim of healing it is through a process of self-actualization or making meaning from it. Another way of conceptualizing is to live life or do a sequence of opposite actions. I think that there are multiple right answers to your question, but I think this is better understood in anxiety and depression group work. Reddit doesn‚Äôt exactly connect well enough."
mentalhealth,fmg9qec,t3_fv1fik,1586044260.0,I‚Äôve been to IOC units which it seems that mental illness isn‚Äôt necessarily necessary nor is a diagnosis of cluster-criteria for them. I‚Äôve always found that everyone has the capacity for anxiety and depression and the determining factor for clinical support was if the client was impaired or unable to conduct daily life as they would normally. I know that most people deal with depression and I know that most people have the capacity to integrate their depression.
therapy,fmg5oy3,t3_fv27bi,1586041803.0,"I connect with you on many of the feelings that you‚Äôve brought up. Anxiety and depression have always existed for all humanity, yet the capacity to adjust to them is different for all of us. Trauma is something that isn‚Äôt totally avoidable and yet many types of situations that cause trauma are tragically unnecessary, like one you‚Äôve brought up. There is a famous Jewish man that talked about suffering and the ways he survived the internment camps of nazi Germany. He is a pivotal example of the human capacity to overcome trauma and suffering. I don‚Äôt think there is one answer to your feelings but you aren‚Äôt alone and you‚Äôll find ways to integrate your trauma into strengthening yourself."
therapy,fmdrpl0,t3_fudu5m,1585975893.0,"It seems like there are many great suggestions on your post. However- your original problem is learning to move through the wrongness that you feel about your friend. It seems that you consider her a friend but you‚Äôve lost trust in that person. Once you have protected your work or feel that your work is safe, it might be helpful to consider that those wronged feelings are you wanting to balance that injustice done on you by her. 

It might be more helpful if you consider her actions of mimicking your work as attempts to balance her own life problems. Consider that your own actions of allowing yourself to give attention to her makes you upset. Be aware of those markers that arise before it makes you upset. Be aware that you haven‚Äôt accepted that injustice nor found peace in your own actions. If you attempt to confront her, consider your intention as well as your ability to communicate the problem to her. If you‚Äôre too indirect or unable to fully articulate the problem and what you wish from her, you‚Äôll only find further struggle with resolving that injustice.

I guess that‚Äôs my suggestion- at least for external conflict. Your feelings are not necessary real and you have to find your own way to accept that you are miserable on your own account and that it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with her now. I hope that some of what I said rings true for you but I know that everyone deals with internalized problems in no single way."

therapy,flj9uwb,t3_fp3p0v,1585203831.0,"It seems like you‚Äôre focused on your past. The trauma of drugs and their impact on your relationship has hurt you. Firstly- you‚Äôre still considered a minor unless your emancipated, so don‚Äôt write yourself out of childhood yet. Secondly- there‚Äôs no one way to deal with trauma- especially CT. You‚Äôre still very young and you have even considered yourself unable to handle the reality of events in your past. Anger seems to be a way of you dealing with those memories and feeling as they come up. Maybe take notice of signals of anger- physical, thoughts, feelings, and emotions. It takes practice to control anger and be present instead of letting the past take our awareness. Lastly- trauma isn‚Äôt unusual in life. Everyone has trauma in various forms and it‚Äôs important to integrate it and harness the power from those experiences- no matter how terrible or tragic. This makes you more resilient if you can accept it. Otherwise, it‚Äôll keep taking over and you‚Äôll stay angry. You‚Äôre young so don‚Äôt expect to solve this immediately.

You mentioned having some mental and physical health problems and taking Praxil to reduce symptoms, yet issues like this pregnancy scare will only get worse if you don‚Äôt act.

therapy,fjxu4tm,t3_ffct1z,1583683397.0,"I‚Äôm no expert. However- it really depends on how often you smoked and for how long as well as the conditions you would smoke in. If smoking was your way of dealing with stress, it‚Äôs possible that your perception of those events would be mostly negative. Paranoia is part of the anxiety tree. It‚Äôs something you can control and change with. You seem hurt by the past and now it‚Äôs the present and you still feel that people don‚Äôt respect you. It comes down to choice and how you approach it. Your person is giving you a choice and throwing the possibility that you aren‚Äôt seeing everything because ‚Äúparanoia‚Äù is perception of belief.

Not an expert but that‚Äôs my reasoning. I hope that you find peace with people because although we deal with suffering alone, we need people to help us in dealing with suffering along the way."

It‚Äôs not uncommon to have thoughts of self loathing or awfulizing situations, especially in school. Look into distress tolerance or mindfulness skills. It takes practice but it‚Äôs beneficial in the long hall. If you feel like you are having trouble concentrating or controlling thoughts or thinking of harming yourself, reach out to professionals for a deeper reflection."

If you can do this, you might be able to focus on the better parts of the relationship, too. This can be difficult because our self has many parts and whatever one is the strongest will be your perspective. Be kind to yourself and accept all feelings you have because true validation comes within beforehand. Our parents are human, so they‚Äôll make plenty of mistakes.

If you signed a consent form, chances are you agreed to a disclosure. It‚Äôs common practice under HIPPA law that psychotherapy notes are secured and clients do not have a right to them.

I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll get access to those notes- especially if they were legally taken to court. That‚Äôs an entirely different ball game. Check your state‚Äôs law and your client consent rights. You might be able to ask the office about their policy."

therapy,fcu32uz,t3_eixepp,1577971073.0,"I think you‚Äôve already made your claim. If you‚Äôre bargaining with yourself, you‚Äôve already made a decision. My insight would be to stay focused on the present- breathing, feeling, and awareness of your body. Anxiety is our worry of the future. However, our imagination and that anxiety go well together and create perfect storms. Telling yourself not to worry or it isn‚Äôt real is a great starting point, but simple actions like opposite reaction, mindfulness, distractions, etc are useful skills to combat anxiety. 

Therapy might not be for you. However, you seem to have specific childhood history that was stressful and possibly traumatic. Maybe you haven‚Äôt integrated those experience into yours adulthood and you want to resolve them. Finding someone we trust, that cares, and gives our story meaning is powerful in healing our suffering. Be vigilant in your self-care. Sometimes these things can be resolved through community.  However, if an agency is extending their hand, it might be wiser to connect with someone professionally.

I commend you on the steps towards helping yourself and sharing your concern and experience. Reddit is a tricky place for support."

However- it is horrifying if such a disease is present in places that could prevent it‚Äôs arise. Now- do I want measles in my community- no. Should vaccines be used collectively- sure.

Futurology,f9c8sj7,t3_e41uxz,1575220542.0,"Working in schools has shown me that students by 3rd grade, who have regular access, use their phones either for entertainment, social media, or and research. I believe that phones are the new era of digitalization for younger generations. However- I do see similar patterns in older gens, too, specifically the Boomers, X‚Äôs, and Millinials. Maybe it‚Äôs unhealthy pattern or maybe it‚Äôs perception of maladaptive behaviors.

If the student is lower-socio economic status, they will have a high observable count with their phones from peers. They‚Äôll use their phones at inappropriate times and in dangerous ways. However, higher SES does not mean they will not be at risk for using their phone in ways that leaves them vulnerable, too. This is all my own experiences with observation and I didn‚Äôt read the article. I think it‚Äôs possible that phones are a sign to help further understand the health of people and their own experiences."
Futurology,f9c5g23,t3_e4go2q,1575219477.0,"Eh- it‚Äôll be just as ineffective as the current camera systems. If anything, it will influence behavior.

Most newer phones have specific anti-driving apps that make it dangerously hard to access your phone while driving. More advanced phones and vehicles lock or restrict cellphone calls while in motion. There are many options for people yet people are creatures of habit. Either- they will change their behavior because the cameras exist or they will not change their behavior because of some impulse to use it."
