It's a horrible shitty feeling to have someone you care about treat you as if you aren't trying, you're always lying, or that you aren't worth basic human dignity.

OP, you're not a horrible person and you deserve to be with someone that's willing to accept you the way you are and make an effort to understand you. I went through a very similar situation with my ex wife. She gradually became more and more manipulative as I tried to do more and more to make her happy. Meltdowns were abusive and I needed to be in control of myself. The gaslighting and degradation got so bad that I was seriously considering suicide. I picked a straight road with huge trees close to the edge and was going to hit a tree going as fast as I could. 

Any change I made wasn't good enough and if I truly cared, I'd be able to just change. The last straw was when she refused to listen. I know it probably isn't what you want to hear, but your relationship doesn't sound healthy and you'll probably be happier once you're no longer under the weight of negativity and start believing yourself again. Don't let anyone tell you that you're a bad person because you struggle with things that come easily to others."
