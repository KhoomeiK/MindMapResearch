Does this mean that, instead of starting with 5 reps for a progression and moving up to 8 reps before switching to the next progression, I should start with 8 reps per exercise and work my way up to 12 before switching to the next progression? 

For instance, I just reached 3 sets of 8 solid reps of dips. I was planning on buying a weighted vest soon and moving on to 5 reps of weighted dips. However, it sounds like I should keep progressing until I reach 3 sets of 12 reps before moving to weighted dips. Does that sound right? Thanks for the help"

me_irl,fpv2yxo,t1_fpv0atu,1588933020.0,"I think it's more than just spending time with friends and other extroverts. I used to have horrendous social anxiety to the point where I dropped out of college to avoid the social expectations, and while I still get anxiety about social situations occasionally, it doesn't really hold me back anymore. Part of it was because I started putting myself out there and interacting with people more often, but a bigger part was that I started learning how to accept that it's okay to look stupid and make a fool of myself and be embarrassing. Literally everyone embarrasses themselves. People are just stupid, imperfect creatures. Anybody who can't see that and judges you for making simple mistakes isn't worth your time anyway. Screwing up and acting like an idiot is funny! Just laugh at yourself and move on. Most people don't give much of a shit about the stupid stuff you do, and if they care enough that they'd judge you negatively for it, they're not someone you'd want to be friends with anyway. 

As long as you are kind, you will find people who will like you. If someone dislikes you for any reason other than you being unkind, they just weren't meant to be your friend in the first place. You may think there's nobody out there that would like you, but even Hitler had friends. Everyone has people out there that will like and accept them. You just have to learn how to like yourself enough to be comfortable waiting until you find those people. It's just an inevitability of life that some people will dislike you. No matter what you do, you can't please everyone. So, you just have to figure out what pleases you, and do those things for yourself. That, plus a little more outgoing-ness, is gonna be your key to overcoming social anxiety. It's certainly challenging to accomplish this, but the rewards are so worth it. It's the difference between being trapped in fear and self-hatred your whole life vs. truly living your life. Your whole life will be better if you can learn how to overcome your social anxiety. You just need to keep up some perseverance, courage, and faith. Hopefully that helped at least a little bit. Good luck out there friend. Hope you learn how to unlock your true, incredible self as soon as possible"

I've been slowly losing my faith in this country every day over the last four years, and when Americans reelect Trump in November, my fears will be confirmed. This country will not do the things I want it to no matter what I do. Quit beating your head against the wall and accept reality. America is dying. It's time has come.

That man can barely even form a coherent thought anymore, and now there's some serious sexual assault allegations against him, too. Trump may be on a similar playing field with the dimentia and sexual assault, but there's one thing we know Trump is good at: talking shit. Trump will absolutely dominate Biden at every opportunity. 

Did anyone see the way Biden acted during the debate with Bernie? He could barely keep himself together and looked like a hopeless moron. Now just imagine him debating someone who isn't too polite to hold back and will attack at all costs. I hate Trump, but I'm enough of a realist to realize that the chances of Biden beating Trump are less than CNN's chances of Trump beating Hillary. 

It's time to focus on the Senate, then get the hell out of dodge. America is clearly dying. The republic is collapsing in front of our eyes and being replaced by some kind of horrible, ugly, distopian, fascist state. The only real chance at saving America died when Bernie lost. The only possible hope will die if the Senate is lost again for another Trump term. We need to focus up and make sure the Senate is flipped, and if that isn't successful, it's time to get the fuck out. I'm moving to Europe ASAP if Trump gets reelected and the GOP keeps the Senate, and I suggest you all do the same. 

The future is not going to look very pretty in America if there's another 4 years of a Trump presidency/GOP Senate combo. The damages from the first term would take decades to repair even without the interference from the right. Now just imagine what Trump could do to this country if he wasn't concerned about reelection. 

We had a chance to save America, and we lost it. Now we have one last opportunity before it's all over. If we win the Senate, we're still in this fight and we have a chance. If not, it's time to accept reality and escape while we can. Your national loyalty is not worth the atrocities you will experience while living under a dying republic with unlimited power. Save yourself while you still have the chance."

My main piece of advice: make mindfulness and meditation your best friend. I've basically devoted all of my free time for the past couple years to finding the most effective way to achieve peace and happiness. By far the best thing you can do for your well-being is to meditate regularly. All I do is 10 minutes a day (I recommend starting with 2-5 minutes and working up) and that makes more of a difference in my mental health and general well-being than eating healthy, exercising, sleeping regularly and all that stuff combined. Meditation is unbelievably powerful for treating addiction. 

Also, if you wanna take your meditation to another level, check out The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle. It may seem strange at first, but trust me, that book will transform your entire life if you really listen to what he has to say and apply it to your life. Good luck on your journey forward friend. You just started a new chapter of your life, and you're going to start loving your life like you never knew was possible. I'm really excited for you! There will be struggle and hardship, but I promise it's all worth it if you just keep pushing forward. Keep it up homie. You've got this!"
