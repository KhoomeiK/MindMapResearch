Anxiety,fezfc61,t3_eqszok,1579456761.0,"Wow, really didn‚Äôt expect this. I‚Äôm actually crying. THANK YOU. This, all these interactions with this post, this is proof that maybe sure we‚Äôre alone with our anxiety, but hey, we‚Äôre alone together. If that makes sense?  We share this with multiple people. Strangers. 

It‚Äôs like watching the world go ablaze, panicking, looking to your left and for once, someone else sees the world on fire too. And you‚Äôre kind of just, hyperventilating together. Which is better than freaking out alone."
Anxiety,fezcvrd,t1_feycg27,1579456005.0,"Maybe that‚Äôs your OK for now. Being okay with not being okay. Cause even with the chaos you kind of end up looking at it and being like ‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù

Anxiety,ewwu0r0,t3_cqhm5e,1565835334.0,How about asking for something to tide you over until you get used to the mask. Or maybe practicing techniques on the day time to help yourself adjust to the mask.

Anxiety,ewwtdxy,t1_ewwt4mf,1565834857.0,"Well ask your therapist about CBT and lexapro or Zoloft. Just literally say what you said here. And that a stranger replied to your comment with this. There would be no reason for her to discredit anything. If she ends up saying that she thinks you don‚Äôt need medication but you still feel like you do, then yeah, like I said, set up an appointment with a psychiatrist. Only psychiatrists can prescribe medication anyways :)"

However, you mentioned therapy.  In my insane state, my cousin and her boyfriend who both suffer from GAD and MDD brought me straight to his psychiatrist. So since you said therapy I assume you‚Äôre only seeing a therapist? Psychoanalyst? Why not find  a psychiatrist and book an appointment and take it from there."

I was terrified, lack of sleep raises your cortisol levels which aids in your anxiety. By week 2 my cousin had to help bring me to the doctor. They couldn‚Äôt give me sleeping meds cause I was frantically explaining that it would shut down my body not my mind and I‚Äôd be stuck. After an hour they finally gave me something. I slept for 18 hours that day, and woke up still scared, but at least not desperate for sleep."

Anxiety,ewvyn20,t3_cqdicd,1565816722.0,"Meds do have a stigma, and it isn‚Äôt always forever.. with cognitive behavioral therapy you could be off it in a year if all things go swimmingly, not always the case but yeah. I was scared of meds too till I hit a point where I couldn‚Äôt function and I thought I was losing my mind. I started on Leda-or and seroquel, with Xanax for panic attacks. Now I‚Äôm on Zoloft, with seroquel only if I can‚Äôt sleep. The daily meds I take as instructed, but the ‚Äúas needed‚Äù meds, sometimes I don‚Äôt take them even though it‚Äôs obviously a time to take it.
We‚Äôre still trying to figure out what works best for me. There, that‚Äôs some solid advice I can give. Every human being is unique, some drugs work, some don‚Äôt, some work when paired with something else, and some leave you zombified. The important thing is to TELL YOU PSYCH EVERYTHING. Helpful to keep note on how you feel each day when you start on it too. Easier said than done. I told her once that I felt a certain way and she switched my meds. I had an anxiety attack at Starbucks cause I was wondering if I did the right thing, what if the lexapro was fine and now I‚Äôm being switched to Zoloft because of something not entirely accurate that I said? But they‚Äôre professionals, it‚Äôs not an easy thing becoming a psych. Also, I can‚Äôt stress enough, as hard as it is to find the medication right for you and the dose, the most important thing is finding the right psych. See 7 psychs if you have to, you need to find one you can trust.if pregnant women meet 10 gyros cause they‚Äôre worried about their baby, we. An see 10 psychs cause we‚Äôre worried about our minds."
Anxiety,ewvxqh4,t3_cqajxu,1565816170.0,"Always. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm up now at 4:55am... my body gets tired, and I know my brain is tired too, but every time I close my eyes I feel like I‚Äôm just pretending to sleep. Then I get scared I‚Äôll get sleep paralysis if I stay still for too long."
Anxiety,ewuc7uy,t3_cq0d01,1565774598.0,"I had one boyfriend take me out for ice cream and say mid-meal ‚Äúcan you stop loving me so much?‚Äù

So now I put a cap on my feelings.. and I‚Äôve seen it reflect badly in other relationships. I‚Äôm a distant lover for that reason and because of such it doesn‚Äôt last so I‚Äôve sort of stopped. 

I‚Äôm also distant cause I also have experienced before in another relationship how much of a burden I can be. 

We were living together and every time I felt and anxiety or panic attack coming I‚Äôd smile and politely say I had to go to the bank, or the bathroom, or that I was going to buy snacks, and I‚Äôd go break down in the parking lot, garbage area or bathroom. After two months of living together I was silently crying in the bathroom trying to control my breathing when I heard him on the other side of the door. He said ‚ÄúI think my shoulder is more comfortable than the toilet bowl. You don‚Äôt have to hide, you can cry on me.‚Äù That was the first time someone ever said something remotely like that to me, and the last time I‚Äôll ever believe it. Fast forward a year and we break up cause he can‚Äôt handle me crying all the damn time. He says I‚Äôm irrational and that I have no reason to be scared as much as I do.  And while he was yelling this, in my head I was just saying ‚ÄúI knew it. I fucking knew it. I should have never, and I will never do that again.‚Äù

So yeah, I avoid relationships cause like most of us, I can‚Äôt handle risking that amount of vulnerability. 

Sorry.. that was long."

Anxiety,ewacvwu,t1_ew99w4o,1565241062.0,Just wanted to say thank you. I was able to sleep after this back and forth. Will be on this more. Is this a good place to come to when your having an episode? I don‚Äôt want to be annoying if that‚Äôs not the case.
Anxiety,ew97pqg,t1_ew97dv6,1565220948.0,I never thought of that. No ones gone insane from anxiety? Really? Couldn‚Äôt it develop into something bigger? Or worse?
Anxiety,ew95spr,t1_ew95e2z,1565220093.0,"I‚Äôll keep that in mind the next time it rises again. 

Can I just ask, do you ever feel like you are losing yourself? I think that‚Äôs the part that terrifies me the most. And to know that others get that too and are still somewhat themselves will be comforting."
