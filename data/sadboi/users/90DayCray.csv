I too believe someone in her family may have been involved, but that girl wasn‚Äôt. I am so pissed she is sitting in prison over a partial print on some duct tape that actually could have come from her grandfather. Her grandmother was a more likely person to be charged or at least further investigated. I‚Äôm just shocked."

By 40 my mom and dad never went out with friends and did things for themselves. These days we maintain a social life, even when we have a significant other and children. 

The good thing about your 30‚Äôs is that you really start to find yourself. I suffer from severe depression so I understand there are bad times, but I am way more comfortable with who I am now than in my 20‚Äôs. You will meet someone when the time is right, and that is different for everyone. Your life isn‚Äôt over, it just feels that way sometimes. Just push through those feelings. Get outside and breathe in the fresh air, go for a walk, talk to a friend. Right now everyone feels isolated but we aren‚Äôt. Friends and family are a phone call away.

I just have to let it go and so do you. Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future. No one is perfect and in our 20‚Äôs we are extremely immature and still trying to navigate life. The fact that we are older now and can reflect and feel shame or embarrassment just means we have matured. We have grown up and obviously we are better people now.
