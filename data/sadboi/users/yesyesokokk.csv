BPD,fovkfwf,t1_fouw3hr,1588102825.0,I 100000% percent agree with you bipolar is easier in a sense and borderline is a bitch. I’m able to know when I’m manic or depressed but with borderline I’m a hot mess I just got diagnosed a few days ago and even the diagnosis alone it’s stressing me out.

bipolar,fokujkb,t3_g7ykur,1587849216.0,Unpopular opinion: lamictal and most mood stabilizers suck. Maybe go back to a lower dose and try an antipsychotic like rexulti or abilify ask ur doc!
bipolar,fokuctl,t3_g7qoxc,1587849113.0,Have you talked to your doctor about borderline personality disorder? I am NOT acting like a doctor or diagnosing you I am just wondering because I had the exact same feelings of high emotion to feeling nothing turns out I had borderline as well as bipolar which is really rare but possible
entj,fokg0pk,t3_g7yjvr,1587841379.0,Advice? Communication is key. They’re blunt so keep in mind they aren’t trying to be mean it’s just how we are. Also do NOT lie. We have intuition and can tell when you’re lying. I’m a female ENTJ btw
ptsd,fokfrht,t1_foje7ro,1587841247.0,I’ve said this before and the person told me I was being dramatic HAHHAHA. People suck sometimes. But overall this is very good advice thank you.
ptsd,fokfhoe,t3_g7qupp,1587841104.0,It’s so fcking annoying. Like really???? You wanna hear about my childhood trauma??? Take a seat.
relationships,foi4oyp,t3_g7e89b,1587778648.0,I also had relationships with older men when I was young due to sexual trauma... I wish I told my parents because things would be a lot more understood. You’re not alone. Just because we fight different battles doesn’t mean we can’t be there for one another. Stay strong love. We need you here.

bipolar,focogh8,t1_focno65,1587673802.0,I feel this. And same I found a med that works. My mild mania is mostly super super productive and sleep doesn’t even cross my mind but then it becomes kind of destructive mania and  an uncomfortable high idk if you know what I mean but ya
bipolar,focndce,t1_focm8nw,1587673415.0,Ah yes I know that feeling all too familiar. If you don’t mind me asking are you bipolar 1 or 2? Because I’m bipolar 1 and I only feel the deterioration at day 3.
bipolarart,focn6vq,t1_focltrb,1587673351.0,You’re welcome. What would you name this piece? Also I think the main reason I don’t do art is because I don’t feel inspired by objects but rather emotions so that’s why I write instead of paint. Both are good outlets during these weird quarantine times. I work in the hospital so I don’t have much time because I am taking care of patients but you’ve given me some thought in attempting to paint!
bipolarart,foc9ymt,t3_g6put6,1587668841.0,I hope you know how lucky you are to have the gift of creativity. I wish I could paint or draw. I’m a writer but not a very good one at that haha. How do you get inspiration to create art?
entj,foc9ayp,t3_g6l9dw,1587668616.0,Yes I feel like becoming a doctor I chose the correct path because it’s the only path I have ever wanted. Yes I’ve thought about other options but they never suited me.
bipolar,foc8z61,t3_g6j0uj,1587668506.0,If you wanna sleep but can’t it’s not hypomania that’s insomnia. If you can’t sleep and have a decreased need to sleep it’s hypomania or mania.

relationship_advice,fo8jmcp,t1_fo8jdhq,1587597837.0,I’m not being shallow. I’m saying it’s something that SHOULDNT bother someone but it’s bothering me so that means something is wrong. I’ve dated short guys before and didn’t care about their height the problem is that I’m finding problems with things that don’t matter.
relationship_advice,fo8hfkg,t1_fo8h75n,1587596614.0,I didn’t think about the whole healing part. That’s really smart of you. I just jumped into the relationship and I don’t think I ever truly processed my previous relationship.
bipolarart,fo8h88z,t3_g676j0,1587596500.0,In a mixed state right now. I have them more than mania or depression alone. It’s terrible
relationship_advice,fo8grpq,t1_fo65ygx,1587596251.0,"It’s so much more than low self esteem though. I was in a toxic relationship purely because you become addicted to the toxicity. I left because it got way too abusive, but for most people yes low self esteem and self image are why they stay with shitty guys or girls. Also, if you grew up with abusive parents you’re more likely to want to stay with someone abusive because it’s what you’re used to and don’t understand real love it’s sad but true."

bipolar,fo2zf3s,t1_fo2z0pl,1587477534.0,I felt punished too! I’m sorry you had such a tough time :( it really sucked for me too. I’m glad you’re doing better though and knowing you’re diagnosis too. Sometimes good things comes from darkness
bipolar,fo2z2hd,t1_fo20ksj,1587477328.0,I told my doc my symptoms and she was actually super hesitant to diagnosis me with BPD but eventually did. All my doctors have been really great but one or two have been kind ofnshitty so ya I agree

bipolar,fo1jwvq,t1_fo1jmny,1587434898.0,I feel like to them it’s all just liability issues. I just had to hide them from seeing me cry every day because to them that would add a day. It was terrible I felt like a prisoner I’m sorry you had a bad experience too.
bipolar,fo1juek,t1_fo1jmci,1587434854.0,So more mental health based places were better than the hospital? Like an outpatient center? I wanted to go to one of those I hear some of them let you keep your phones
entj,fo1jkk1,t1_fo1j9e0,1587434683.0,Not sure if that helps but it’s just a simple slightly detailed description of the entj and personal growth. I am an ENTJ female btw
entj,fo1jh2p,t1_fo1j9e0,1587434623.0,"ENTJ people are realists, in the most basic sense of the word. Not only because their thinking is based upon a clear view of how things actually are in the world around them, but also because their ideas and strategies are structured around those unambiguous, ""down to earth"", commonsense beliefs which sum up the obvious and undeniable in life. But while ENTJs might be pragmatic about the immediate situation before them, they are scarcely satisfied with it until it can be made more productive, useful or valuable. The ENTJ's reasoning on such matters is always clear and generally unemotional. If action can improve an item or a situation then it ought to be taken, and the ENTJ will always be found in the midst of such action, organizing, planning and leading the way forward until the best result possible has been realized. This makes success for an ENTJ something that can be clearly seen, a real world result which can be measured. And whether measured in dollars, bricks, bread or just happy people, the successful ENTJ knows the result is due to their belief that it is just plain commonsense to try and make the best of every situation and get the most out if it for the most people. - http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENTJ_per.html"

bipolar,fo1j1lp,t1_fo1ir7g,1587434359.0,The no phones thing really bothered me because I use my phone to journal and help with my mental health so it was actually really bad for me. I kept my art pieces too but then I threw them out because I realized how sad I was at the time and didn’t recognize them.

I once wore a dress that went past my knees and still got called a whore for wearing what I thought they would like. Now that I live away from them I struggle finding creativity in fashion like I want. I just wear big t shirts and shorts because I’m afraid of being called a slut.

You will see over time how much love they bring and give with a simple wag of their tail :)"
