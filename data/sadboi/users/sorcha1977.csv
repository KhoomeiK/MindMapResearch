kzoo,fquw6gk,t1_fqurpsf,1589665471.0,"Oh, one more comment. If you're into history, you might like this.

It's the second-oldest apartment building in Kalamazoo. It was built in the 1920s, so you can still see some Art Deco touches in the features and architecture. It's neat to think about all of the people who lived there over the years.

There are little doors in the hallways, halfway up the wall. If you walk into your kitchen, you will see a matching door. This is how milkmen delivered milk in apartment buildings. They would put the milk in the hallway door, and then you would open the kitchen side to remove the milk. :) The counter blocked ours from opening, but it was still really cool.

There is a large drawer in the kitchen with a metal slide on top. This is an old bread drawer!

Also in the kitchen, there's a cutout area for storing brooms and whatnot, along with a shelf that has a U-shape cut out of it. That's actually the original spot for an old refrigerator. The condenser units used to sit on top, hence the U-shape cut out of the shelf to accommodate it."

The building itself was extremely quiet while I lived there (2009-2011). Most residents were grad students and young professionals in their early 30s. The rental rate tends to keep most of the young/loud students away, and since all of the apartments are one-bedroom, you don't have to put up with noise from kids. :)"

kzoo,fquk2bf,t3_gl07tg,1589660187.0,"I lived at the Colonial for two years, but they were under different management at the time.

I had an end unit on the second floor.

Pros: gorgeous apartment, tons of windows, awesome historic details, HUUUUUGE storage closet (it runs the entire length of the living room and is the width of a twin bed), decent water pressure, laundry on-site, close to everything, secure entrance, plenty of off-street parking, nice neighbors

Cons: The hardwood floors are thin. If you are on the first or second floor, you will hear every. single. footstep. from upstairs. I could actually hear my upstairs neighbor tapping drumbeats on his legs every so often.

If you do not have an end unit, the apartment is TINY. You don't get the huge storage closet, lots of windows, etc. If you can afford it, get an end unit.

The end units have kind of a weird layout. I didn't like everything arranged in a line. The massive living room and dining area (with all those windows omg) kind of made up for it, but it still felt weird.

I didn't experience any crime when I lived there. The Stuart area is pretty safe. Sometimes people wander down from the north side at night, especially since they built that Walgreens on Michigan, but I used to go for long walks at night and never got hassled. (I'm a young-ish female.)

I've lived at two of Ancora's properties, and while I wasn't completely unhappy with them, there was a ton of flakiness on their end both times I rented from them. They'll say one thing and then spin it another way when you call them on it. Try to communicate by email if possible, and keep copies of every conversation. I was able to prove them wrong three separate times. I also think their apartments are seriously overpriced, even with the remodels (the Colonial has not been remodeled)."

As one doctor said, you can't keep cancer and heart patients waiting, and you can't leave someone with severe hip pain on narcotics for too long because they could get addicted. Additionally, they have no quality of life. (I know this from personal experience. My dad has been waiting for over two months.)

Measles ranges from R0 12-16, meaning one person can infect 12-16 people at a time.

The annual flu ranges from R0 0.9 to 2.1. That's why it doesn't spread super quickly during certain times of year (summer, when the R0 is smaller) and then spreads a bit quicker during winter.

Once a virus is below 1, it basically dies out because it's getting passed to fewer and fewer people. If the R0 value is below 1, each existing infection causes less than 1 new infection. Quick math = virus with nowhere to go = no more virus.

If states keep their R0 below 1, they can reopen much faster, and we'll have much fewer sick people. Masks are extremely important when it comes to keeping that number down, along with washing your hands and sanitizing common spaces (at work and home)."

Whitmer extended our ""Stay Home, Stay Safe"" order to May 28. She said the name of the order is shifting to ""Safer At Home"", as some people have either returned to work or will be returning in the next week. (Construction, landscaping, other ""outdoor"" occupations, and real estate returned to work today.) ""Safer At Home"" implies that while some people have returned to work, it is still safer to stay home whenever possible (to both protect yourself and those of us who are working). I like this transition. Even though it's just a slogan, it shows there's an end in sight. :)

On May 11, manufacturing workers who are not already working under the ""critical infrastructure"" heading will go back to work. This includes the Big 3 (GM, Ford, Chrysler). The Big 3 plan to start phasing employees in on May 18, starting with 25% capacity at plants.

Since manufacturing makes up 19% of Michigan's economy, this is **very good news**. 4-5% have been working this entire time, so that's another 14-15% back to work! This is also extremely important to other Midwestern states, such as Ohio, because (for example) their auto plants work concurrently with ours. Certain parts made in Michigan go to Ohio for vehicle assembly, and vice versa.

It basically states that, yes, our active case numbers are still going up, but it is LARGELY due to increased testing and outbreaks in places like nursing homes, prisons, and manufacturing plants. There is very little ""community transmission"".

One really good example of this took place in Otsego County (Gaylord is the ""largest"" city, if that helps you place it). They went from 35-90 cases during the last two weeks of April, but it was mainly due to an outbreak at a long-term care facility. At least 30 staff members and 33 residents tested positive.

This shows that our ""Stay At Home"" restrictions are working. :)"

Anxiety,fpivil2,t1_fpitbqv,1588649690.0,"4 degrees Celsius is around 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

30 degrees Celsius is around 86 degrees Fahrenheit.

So that's a 26 degree difference (Celsius) from end of winter to mid-summer. Multiply that by 3.08, and you have a 80.08% reduction in cases. :) That's HUGE! Instead of, say, 40,000 new cases, you'd have around 8000 new cases.

Not all areas get that hot and stay that hot, but even my area of Michigan tends to hit the mid-80s pretty regularly during July and August.

Obviously, this won't prevent transmission in places like offices, theaters, and restaurants, which are air-conditioned, but it bodes well for restaurants with outdoor seating and outdoor concert venues. Plus, people tend to move their house parties outside to their backyard, or a beach BBQ, or whatever."

Anxiety,fpczxow,t1_fpcxd4m,1588516812.0,"Colds, flus, bronchitis, sinus infections, pneumonia - you can get those again and again, but our bodies have learned to fight them off. In more serious cases of pneumonia and the flu, some people may end up in the hospital or even die, but the vast majority of people stay in bed for a few days, push liquids, and take Tylenol for their fever.

Hell, I even had chickenpox twice.

I don't think the Covid immunity is lifetime. I believe I read it's 2-3 years, which is still great. That means no ""second wave"", and it gives scientists more time to get the vaccine out.

It will be more like getting a flu shot than getting the MMR vaccine. We'll have to get the shot every year, most likely, which is fine with me. :) I'll just combine it with my flu shot."
