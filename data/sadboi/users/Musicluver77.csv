PanPorn,fr28vyd,t3_gm90s3,1589833158.0," These had been in various conditions when I acquired them. I ended up finishing a few off as room air fresheners, because the top notes had gone off. 

-Halle Berry ""Exotic Jasmine"". 11ml. I â™¡ this!! It is super HTF now, but I will keep looking!

-Halle Berry ""Pure Orchid"". 11ml. I also â™¡ this! 

-Faith Hill ""Faith Hill"". 11ml. Very pretty white floral. 

-Kim Kardashian ""Pure Honey"". 100ml. This is a gorgeous scent, but the bottle is horrible! I almost dropped it so many times. 

-Ariana Grande ""Ari"" hair mist. 150ml. I bought this years ago new, before I went down a rabbit's hole with collecting and couldn't afford the bottle. **This one makes me particularly happy to have panned, as it brought a lot of joy at the beginning.  

-Hugo Boss ""Pure Purple"". 90ml. I received this in a swap half full. It is HTF now, but very pretty almond powdery scent. 

-Revlon ""Fire and Ice"". I think 50ml. Came to me leaked in a swap box, so this is not my actual pan. The bottom bit is hard to get out so calling it done

-Sarah Jessica Parker ""Covet"". 100ml. Came to me half full in a swap. The bottom bit has gone completely off, and smells like paint thinner, so calling it done. Very nice when fresh! Would buy again. 

-Nautica ""Voyage "". 30ml. My son's first cologne at age 12. He finished it. Very easy to wear and safe. Great alternative to Axe body sprays!

-Britney Spears ""Fantasy"". 50ml. This was purchased in 2007, and was my signature that summer. One of my first real perfumes, and I saved to afford it. I haven't tried the reformulation and honestly wouldn't want to. I will always keep the nostalgia of wearing this summer of 2007 in my heart â™¡.

ottawa,fquqd9n,t3_gl0onh,1589662971.0,"I have a nutty neighbour (""Noise Nazi"") living under me. She has been a complete nightmare.  I have had other encounters with her, as we share a doorway, unfortunately. I suggest keeping track of times she bangs on the ceiling. This is harassment in my books. You are allowed to make a reasonable amount of noise, during the day. Sounds like she needs to move. I would write a letter to your landlord and let them know everything that is going on, and include copies of the letters you have. They should be issuing her at least a written warning to knock off the banging. (Play up the angle that she is also likely causing damage to the popcorn ceilings in her unit too, if you have them in your building).  In my case I ended up having to open a police harassment file against my neighbour. I believe they may have called her too because the nonsense quieted down after. Sorry you are dealing with this."

My biggest challenge currently is trying not to buy perfume. I also have tendencies to overbuy in general... books, clothing, tea, toys from my childhood (eBay is bad for me!). I have also taken an interest in better skincare products lately, so am trying to research without becoming obsessed. 

 I would like to run this thread, for at least the duration I am still struggling. I have literally been overspending my whole life (would spend allowance as soon as I got it in childhood...yes, I was *that* person). For me I feel it is more beneficial to be hosting a thread, as I run out of steam as a sideline participant and stop posting.  The running the thread is helpful to me for sure. When (hopefully if) the day comes that I have conquered my reasons for over shopping, I am willing to hand the thread over to someone else and let them run it-keep it going! My overshopping is closely tied to my mental health struggles. I hope to get better organized after I move, to start more aggressively chipping away through my self-help resources.

However, I came to realize other people could benefit from this type of thread. I hadn't seen a daily thread of this sort, aside from the general chat thread.

Empties:

-Sephora brand Brightening eye cream 20ml. I bought this in August and it lasted until now! I honestly don't feel it brightened my eyes, but did moisturize under the eyes nicely. WNRP unless I have tried other brands first. (Already have a Tarte one waiting to use). 

-""At the Beach"" BBW super soft body butter 185g (in the tub). I am so sad this has been discontinued. It is my holy grail of body lotions...the scent, texture. Maybe I will be lucky enough to stumble upon another lot in my eBay travels. This is the third tub I have ever finished. I have plenty of other brand back ups and one of this. 

Items getting tossed:

-Sugar lip serum advanced therapy. I never liked this. It was part of a gift set. It makes my lips go numb a bit and tastes horrible.

BPD,fiqdj2n,t3_f9139h,1582641841.0,"I have trouble with steady employment for this reason. I have never been in a ""great"" place when employed and end up struggling. When I feel overwhelmed I suffer, choosing to keep it inside. Eventually it overflows and it becomes obvious I am distressed. I have met some very kind employers. They have listened when I opened up. However, it frustrates me that I can't get it together and separate from my feelings, while working. I obviously can put a game face on, but will fall apart behind the scenes. I too have felt shameful about having to tell my employer what is going on in my head. Why can't I just do my job and keep the drama to a minimum, you know? 
 I was *just* talking about this with my fiancÃ©e the other day. I am contemplating easing back into the work force later this year. However I am scared of feeling overwhelmed (did I mention I have three kids too?). My fiancÃ©e said that employers probably appreciate honesty, but he missed my point of feeling like I need ""special gloves"". I don't want my employer to know about the BPD. Walking that line is a difficult act, isn't it? 
 Good for you for even working! Honestly, it isn't easy to work living with BPD. (Hence me temporarily being unemployed). I am glad your employer comforted you. You deserve it!

You have taken the very courageous step of stepping into the unknown.

PerfumeExchange,fglzajc,t1_fgly0m4,1580914573.0,"Ok, cool. I noticed your bottle is 100ml. Mine is 50ml. I am happy to throw in a bunch of samples you might like. Or maybe I have a designer scent you might like in addition? I can send a list of what I have.

It is 50ml, sprayed only a few times. A fun scent for sure! (Hard to get in Canada too! A friend in the US ordered it and sent it to me)."
PerfumeExchange,fgl5n3k,t1_fgk5g6a,1580882828.0,"I don't know if I have any that quite fit that bill. I do have these though:

\-""Mon Numero 9"" by L'Artisan Parfumeur (Like a green, orange tree)

\-""Fleurs d'Oranger"" by Serge Lutens (though it is a partial bottle, about 40% full)

\-""Success"" by Bond 9

\-""Cinemaniac"" by Xyrena (gourmandish, with notes of licorice, coke and popcorn)

\-""Washington Square"" by Bond 9 (rose)

\-""West Side"" by Bond 9 (Boozy rose)"
