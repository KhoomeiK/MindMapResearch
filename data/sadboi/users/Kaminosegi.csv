Always ending up regretting it. Now I'm trying my best to supress it, meditation works (there's an app called headspace).
I also learned that anger is triggered and linked to fear, pain, depression, negative feelings... That's where you find the root of anger itself. 
Practice meditation everyday, and whenever you get angry take a deep breath with your nose, and exhale via the mouth. Repeat and let your head cool down first. You can practice doing this everyday with simple things that make you angry in your everyday life first.
We are humans, we commit mistakes, and we never stop learning and growing up.

Like whenever you feel you are getting angry, dont let it grow, the bigger it gets, the easier it is for it to take control of you, and end up doing things you will regret.

Right now it's really dark, but you must keep it up. The first thing you should do is fix yourself, take your time, meditate, use that time to think about yourself, what are your problems? what's causing everything to shatter? Find the root, and try to change yourself for the better. Even after that you might not find goals, but new goals will show up in time.

Had you ever tried this app called headspace, it helps a lot. You can try some meditation (I'm starting to do it recently). Whenever you get angry, let your head cool down first... You can take a deep breath through the nose, then exhale it through the mouth. There's something we must learn, to hold it. Even if they did wrong or are wrong, hold it.
