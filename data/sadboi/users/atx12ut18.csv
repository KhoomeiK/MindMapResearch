clothdiaps,f70spd8,t3_du141i,1573332135.0,"They don’t look worn out to me in that pic but they may not be as stretchy as they could be if you got them second hand. Also, the previous comment is spot on. Don’t stretch your elastics while her they’re warm or hot. Wait until they’re cool from the dryer to stuff pockets or use covers. If you stretch them while they’re got they ware out very quickly."
relationship_advice,f6pxzof,t1_f6px7pc,1573066727.0,Your absolute right. That’s a horrible situation for a 14 yr old to be in.  If it was my 14 yr old i would be devastated. But the unpopular truth is that he has no right to tell her she has to get an abortion or he’s going to kick her out.  If he has no intention of kicking her out then what? He was just trying to manipulate her into an abortion? That’s really messed up. What happened to her body her choice? Or is it only her body her choice when it fits the narrative? If she wants to keep the baby you can easily argue it’ll ruin her life and you probably won’t be wrong. But he’s an adult. He’s her father and he is supposed to support and guide her the best he can. NOT manipulate and threaten his CHILD while she’s extremely vulnerable and emotional. That’s beyond fucked. I stand by my opinion. He’s a piece of shit for handling it the way he did.
relationship_advice,f6ptr2i,t3_dsj4nn,1573064080.0,"Wow. You’re a piece of shit father. Her body her choice. HER BABY! She made adult choices, with adult consequences and that’s just the reality of the situation. Wow. I can’t even imagine kicking my child out of the house in a situation like this... wow."
NoStupidQuestions,f64ti5h,t1_f64svia,1572695988.0,Interesting. Will consider refrigeration next time I’m trying to slow decomposition.
Parenting,f59eqma,t3_dn76nc,1572086296.0,My 2 yr old loves clocks but doesn’t pronounce the l. Every morning we come downstairs for breakfast and she cheerfully says “good morning cock!” To the clock in the dining room 🤦🏼‍♀️
clothdiaps,f3q0xcf,t3_dhob6v,1571067971.0,"The ONLY thing i can make work for my girls for any extended period of time at night is 2 flower sack towels and a cover. They completely soak through everything else i tried. Now they’ll sleep 10+ hours with no leaks. From what i understand, it actually had a lot to do with how they were actually sleeping. My older daughter sleeps on her stomach and since most regular daytime diapers have the most absorbent parts at the bottom, they weren’t cutting it. The flower sack towels absorb in the front and around the hips because of how they’re folded so it works better at night while they’re laying in positions they wouldn’t normally be in during the day. For us anyway. 

Good luck!"
intermittentfasting,f2l83e4,t1_f2l5y2w,1570292790.0,Agreed!

clothdiaps,f051n1v,t3_d3t26q,1568400685.0,What kind of inserts are you using? I use quite a few Charlie banana pockets and don’t have a leaking problem but i don’t use the microfiber inserts they came with.  That may be your issue. I did notice i would have to tighten the elastics after every wash when my daughter was smaller though. Are your elastics tight enough to be snug around your babies thighs ?
offmychest,f04wlz6,t1_f04tmtn,1568397305.0,"A financial planner is a great idea. We’ve talked about paying off our house first, along with a couple smaller debts and then investing the majority of the rest. I already told him i don’t want any of my family to know either! It’s hard to assume the worst of people but i wouldn’t put it past people to get really needy really quickly. 

Thanks for the advice!"
clothdiaps,f04prkz,t3_d3ro61,1568392866.0,You should be able to your finger up into the bottom snaps. That will make everything line up a little better and look neater. Other than that it looks correct to me
Parenting,ezq15ja,t1_ezq0h85,1568053114.0,Thank you!
Parenting,ezq154u,t1_ezq0sev,1568053106.0,That’s a good idea. Thanks !
Parenting,ezq13bd,t1_ezq0jjr,1568053073.0,That makes me feel better. My daughter is late to talk as well. Maybe she is just frustrated she isn’t getting her point across. Thank you!
breastfeeding,ezk7lt8,t3_d1b28o,1567956265.0,So i was in a similar situation after i had my first baby. A few days pp i fell and badly shattered my ankle. Like... my foot was hanging from my leg. It was terrible. I had to have surgery to completely reconstruct the ankle. Since there was so much swelling we had to wait about a week for the swelling to go down before the surgery to make sure they’d be able to close the incisions after the operation so i was able to pump a ton of milk. I also got a lot of mixed answers about anesthesia and pain meds while nursing. I’m not sure what kind of anesthesia i got exactly but the anesthesiologist told me the day of that the general rule was if i was awake enough to hold the baby i could nurse her. So i did. I was away from my 12 day old for a full 24 hours. She drank pumped milk from a bottle during that time. I was given a lot of morphine afterwards so i did decide to pump and dump until i was off the morphine but that was a personal choice. She didn’t have nipple confusion. We bonded just the same as we would have otherwise. We actually probably bonded more because i couldn’t walk at all for 8 weeks so the kid literally didn’t leave my chest haha you are gonna be ok mama! That baby will be ok! You’ll be able to get all the baby snuggles afterward and bond with your little one just the same.  I realized afterwards i stressed about it way more than i needed to. I was a mess being away from my baby that long but we survived.
Parenting,ezdvb2f,t3_d0t1v9,1567855537.0,"I’ve gone back and forth on if i should comment for too long so I’m going to. Reading this literally made me cringe. Stop calling it a nut house/ crazy house. That is beyond messed up and cruel to say. As a teen i was hospitalized twice for my mental health and guess what? I’m a functioning adult who has a job, is happily married and has two kids who are loved and cared for. You may not understand what your son is going through and you may not be able to support him but i can speak from experience that if you are not sensitive to the situation and at least try to be sympathetic you are going to cause to many issues for that poor boy. He deserves so much praise for seeking help and being vocal enough to come to you about it. Be an adult and educate yourself about whatever issues he’s having, the appropriate treatment and how to speak about it appropriately."
bipolar,exszj32,t1_exscq8r,1566560028.0,"Thank you! Kids are so fun aren’t they? Haha my oldest is a firecracker so i can’t even imagine her as a threenager yet. My heart goes out to you! 

You do have a good point about being able to handle more for our children. It’s just completely terrifying to imagine so many so little! I’ll definitely look into other contributing factors for the back ache."

AmItheAsshole,evchn4y,t3_cj8qg9,1564415431.0,"Unpopular opinion but i don’t think locks on bedroom doors are appropriate or safe for children 😬 i grew up in a home where people knocked on the door. Privacy was a big deal so i wasn’t being barged in on and if i had a lock on my door i would have gotten into 10x more trouble easily. My husband and i have also agreed when our kids are old enough to want privacy that’s totally fine, you always knock on a door before entering but there won’t be locks on bedroom doors. ( there are locks on bathroom doors for anyone wondering, not not bedrooms) 🤷🏼‍♀️"
AmItheAsshole,ev2fj12,t3_ci2e9b,1564175950.0,This made me laugh out loud because my husband literally does the exact same thing. He stands there letting the water run longer than he actually showers. It makes me crazy. Fortunately i work from home so it doesn’t really matter but my heart goes out to you! NTA
clothdiaps,eudzf7u,t1_eudx0ou,1563731412.0,"I can’t speak to the ammonia problem because i haven’t had that particular issue, although my heart goes out to you because that sounds super frustrating! I do actually use a mix of cotton prefolds and charcoal bamboo inserts on my 19 mo during the day though. I definitely prefer the FST! They’re literally the only thing she doesn’t leak through at night and I’ve never had a blow out during the day using them. ( i have had blowouts with my pocket diapers ) they’re also super cheap to buy, so if you decide to give them a try and don’t like them you won’t be out much. Even if you don’t love them for your 3 yr old i bet you’ll love them for your baby. I use them exclusively for my almost 2 mo. Regardless, if you’re at your wits end I’d say they’re worth a shot!"
clothdiaps,eudntn7,t3_cfzyue,1563722788.0,"In my experience, microfiber anything sucks 😬 for a 5 week old i would definitely use flower sack towels. That’s what i have used on both my girls and they’ve been great. Good luck!  A Lot of cloth diapering is trial and error."

lds,epr8cg5,t3_bvnkvm,1559420028.0,"I don’t know that divorce is the best option for y’all or not but i have a feeling that most people that comment will tell you to try counseling, fast, pray etc. While i believe those things can help you come to the best decision, I’d just like to say that IF divorce is the best option you should not feel guilty for it. You won’t shame your family or bring dishonor to your house. Unfortunately because everyone is free to make their own decisions, it is a totally real possibility that your spouse can take a different path than you and the only real option is to go your separate ways. There’s a big stigma in the church surrounding divorce but please don’t let that sway your decision. I know the Lord will guide you through times like these. They’re hard but you can absolutely figure it out! Marriages fail, and that’s ok. It doesn’t mean you did anything “wrong” or that you’re unworthy of finding the right match for yourself."
IDmydog,eop73ct,t1_eop3fa9,1558756395.0,It was a vet that actually suggested the breed but they aren’t as tall as i would imagine any Great Dane mix to be so I’ve been skeptical. They’ll definitely be big though. When we got them in January they were only 5 lbs. Pit mix definitely makes more sense!
IDmydog,eooz0ke,t1_eoovad2,1558751047.0,Definitely makes sense. The black one is built like a tank. Just solid. And they’re both pretty strong willed
IDmydog,eoov9ea,t1_eoonrei,1558748651.0,Oh i could definitely see some pit bull in the face now that you mention it. Thanks!
latterdaysaints,eogb2vk,t3_brqpzq,1558554369.0,"Whatever you do, please be kind and loving to the girls. I would strongly suggest praying about the best way to reach them. The girls aren’t the problem! 

When i was in YW my parents were inactive and i only ended up at church occasionally. There were only 2 laurels. Myself and a girl i didn’t get along with who attended every week and was very active. When i did come to class or activities there were always comments like “for those of us who were here last week” or “who can help catch up the rest of the group who has missed some activities” This pushed me sooooo far away from the church and i ended up being inactive in my adult life for years. I’m not implying this is happening in your ward but please me especially mindful of how you’re coming across to the girls when you invite / reach out etc. You have no idea why they don’t attend or what’s going on in their home/ personal life. 

Good luck !"
