In highschool and during my bachelor's I'd spend my summers out camping and exploring the wilderness of all the lakes in Far Northern Minnesota. Large scale logging hasn't been a thing there for at least a hundred years, but there are still old logs floating vertically around in the lakes that you'll come across sometimes. They are called deadheads and the process of sitting in water for decades at a time does some to the wood that allows you to turn the lumber into beautiful furniture. Or that's the basic understanding I have. If you can manage to haul one off those fuckers out of the lake (which is illegal in some areas I'm fairly sure) you can either sell it locally or on ebay for a ton of money.

When I was 16 I spend a day trying to pull one onto shore, but all I had was a shitty paddle boat, a shitty rope, and my sister who isn't so great at outdoorsy things. So yeah, that didn't happen. Those logs drag like crazy in the water though and require a ton of energy to move. And once you get close to shore, the one end of the log that likes to float lower beneath the surface will start to drag in the sand and silt that exists on the shorelines in most Minnesota lakes. Then you need like 10 times the amount of energy to move the log any further and most people just give up at that point and let the log just drift back out.

[Also, apparently they can fuck your boat up.](http://www.ganache.ca/2005/12/11/the-risk-of-deadheads/)"

The only reason I say that is that it doesn't seem like any of his press conferences prior to this have put any emphasis on blaming other countries for what's happening in New York. If anything, I think it could be possible this is a stab at Trump since whenever it's mentioned to Trump that he failed to adequately prepare for the pandemic, he always goes back to saying that he banned travel from China. And perhaps this would be Cuomo's push back, bringing up that Trump failed to take seriously the global aspect of the pandemic and failed to proactively stock PPE since he didn't consider the spread of the virus from a region besides China as a possibility.

Idk, thoughts? There's definitely anti-European sentiment in the US, but that tends to originate from right wing or colonial reparations groups. And I don't think Cuomo fits either of those"

If you haven't been following the medical literature coming out of the Covid related research world, it's fucking insane right now. So. Many. Studies.

Basically everyone and their mother is trying to publish their data right now. And that's great, but holy fuck, no one has time to peer review anything since all of the experts who'd be reviewers are also the people who are currently on the frontlines/sick due to being on the frontlines. So it's kind of like the Wild West in terms of publishing standards. Other researchers and medical professionals are aware of this and being cautious in how they interpret results and everything being published. I'm not sure how aware the general public is of any of this though, since there's usually a information disconnect with this type of stuff. 

If I had to use an analogy for current state of research, it would be that Covid data is currently like wet sand. And doctors and researchers are like people at the beach, dumping buckets of wet sand onto an already huge mound of wet sand, thinking to themselves ""Maybe somebody will have time in 6 months from now to turn our clusterfuck of wet sand into a sand castle""."

When you spend enough time slowly sounding out the words and then trying to say them more quickly and naturally, however, eventually something just kinda clicks in your brain like ""oh fuck, that's English"". And then it's way easier to read signs and texts written in those languages. It's like one of those optical illusions, like the duck-hare image, where you stare at an object until it morphs into a completely different object and you can't switch back and see the object you'd originally perceived it as anymore.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fpgto95,t1_fmfusjh,1588609317.0,"Reading the comments on this post is so weird given the state of the world now, especially in regards to nursing homes and assisted living facilities. I forget the name of the facility, but 2 weeks ago there was news about an assisted living facility in Québec that had something like 31 of their residents due of Covid. This was supposed to be a bougie facility catering towards the rich. Turns out the owners/management were terrible human beings and left the staff to fend for themselves. 

Most of the staff either got infected or stopped showing up out of fear since they were essentially being expected to perform as ICU nurses, minus the training, PPE, and compensation. And for those unaware, ICU nurses, or the broader category of Clinical Nursing Specialists, have a significant amount of additional education and training compared to a RN, who has significant amount of additional training compared to LNPs, CNAs, PCAs, Techs, and other types of lower level care providers, who all have varying degrees of education and qualifications from eachother. All of these staff are needed to help meet the day to day needs of their residents, but they are painfully aware that they are not specialists and demanding them to perform as though they're running an ICU is completely unethical towards them and their residents, especially when they are just making above minimum wage. (Med school students going into residency would agree about the pay part in particular since hospitals abuse the fuck out of them) 

This particular facility is only one of many that's collapsed during the pandemic and it's absolutely heartbreaking and disgusting when you see what exactly the staff and patients have been forced to endure. The patients of this facility in particular were starving to death while lying in pools of their own waste, saying that they weren't dying of Covid. Since the staff barely had the proper protective equipment, they weren't fairing much better.

So much is going to have to change in how we think about caring for the elderly and vulnerable."

Coronavirus,fpb6fxm,t1_fpaurw0,1588463103.0,"Yeah that's why I still have really mixed feelings about the strategy even after reading about it more indepth. It wasn't a knee jerk decision they made, but like you said and the article you linked stated, they based their decision on a lot of assumptions about the virus based on the data we had early in the pandemic. I understand that they had to act quicker than I'm sure they would have liked since Europe got hit harder way earlier than the Americas. But it was a huge risk they took. 

Also, I'm not a Swede and am not living in Sweden, so I'd like to say my academic background helps me understand their situation a bit better, but I'm still an outsider. 

While it hasn't turned into a complete disaster, it's still not great obviously. Idk, I need to read more about the data that Norway and Finland were basing their decisions on. And since Sweden made this decision in order to play the long game, it's still too early to say if the strategy was truly a failure since apparently the benefits won't be realized until the later waves, or that's the idea anyway.

The more I've read about it, the more I understand why they made the decision they did given the information they had at the time. I posted a bunch in this thread since this topic is particularly interesting to me, but I want to be clear that I'm still pretty unsure on my personal feelings on the decision. Especially since it was based on the idea of long-term immunity; which, if false, will be a complete disaster for them.

Their strategy wasn't the herd immunity strategy of the UK. And their worries about the economy, in general, aren't motivated by the greed like you see in the US. It was made out of evidence that the medical system and key sectors of the economy wouldn't be able to survive a long term lockdown, so basically conditions that are specific to Sweden, not everyone else."

That's been my observation anyway. It's like they hadn't been paying attention before, so now they are trying to reinvent the wheel and report on the virus while being unaware of all the information that's been compiled and shared by the international community that had been affected well before the US was."
Coronavirus,fpal0et,t1_fp9zt3b,1588450342.0,"They were reporting about it plenty starting from January. They can't force you to read it though. There was a huge time lag in how long it took for information to desceminate in the US compared to Eurasia and Oceania. If there was proper leadership in the US I'm sure that would have helped, but still, the current administration is fairly representative of the longheld general mindset and attitude that a lot of the US has towards scientific literacy, embracing protective social policies, and cooperation with the international community. 

Even if people were proactively informing themselves about the situation earlier, I don't think they would have been able to counteract the culture anti-intellectualism that's been stoked and nurtured in the US for who knows how long at this point. Right wingers still would have said the whole thing is fake, and since they are the ones in power the federal response would have been a useless as it has been. The protests would have still happened and been encouraged by Fox.

One of the more telling signs of this is how many people in the US still are misunderstanding why Sweden took the policy they did. They didn't do this to show the world that everyone was wrong about the virus and they certainly didn't intend to provide an example for how every country should act. Sweden made a very risky decision because they did take the virus seriously and realized that this wasn't going to resolve itself in a few months. 

They looked over their resources and various strategies for addressing the pandemic and realized their economy and medical systems didn't have the resiliency for a long term lockdown that larger countries had. Sweden has a small population, but it's still large enough that their healthcare systems could become overwhelmed and collapse, especially during the later waves. So they decided that it made the most sense, given the options available to Sweden, that this would be the least harmful option while fully recognizing that they didn't have any good options really. Their decision gambled on long term immunity being a thing, and if that proves to be wrong then this could backfire. 

I had been a lot more critical of the thinking behind Sweden's response until I sat down and fully read everything their public health officials were saying went into making this decision. I'm still not sure if I support the decision, but I understand why they made it.

But the one thing that Sweden has been very clear on is that this response has been misrepresented a lot by people from other countries who want some evidence that all of the scientists were wrong and that their respective countries should reopen everything immediately. Only if a country has a similar situation should this approach be considered, since this approach was chosen due to an open admission that Sweden had no good options. The US absolutely should not attempt anything like this as a general policy across the country. And, returning to my original point about the US, the fact that so many Americans don't understand this and are still pushing, sometimes successfully, for their states to take this approach shows that the US's overall mindset doomed it to it's current trajectory before the virus ever reached its shores.

Edit: I should add that I do agree that a lot of journalists have done a terrible job of trying to compress an extremely complicated situation into a single system when they write about this. At least in the US, that has been going on since the virus started spreading across the US and actually scaring Americans. American media that had seriously been reporting on the virus from the beginning, barring Fox and other associated media who rely on a perpetually terrified audience, did a much better job of reporting the situation as it was playing out in other countries. I'd imagine this was because their audience had a more global mindset and was more accustomed to digesting and understanding complex issues that weren't yet directly impacting their own lives yet."

Fucking everyone lives in a self reinforcing ideological bubble these days, but it's the far right's bubble that pushes people into radicalized violence. Disagree with me if you want, but this is my experience.

Another important thing to note is that far right and Republicans are not synonymous despite the overlap between members of both groups. That's a really important point because one part of progressive ideology in the US that I think is really toxic is the belief that all Republicans are far right and any attempt to reach out to have civil conversations about contensious political issues with these people is evil.

It plays some role in SARS-2 nCov transmission but we still don't have a good understanding of the specifics of it. There's papers coming out, but it's really messy because the peer review process has kind of fallen apart at the moment and is occurring after the papers have been published. This leads to papers being redacted, but the general public usually don't hear of or pay attention to the redactions. For example, a paper last week that was claiming to have proof of airborne transmission occurring due to a fan dispersing the virus across a room was redacted for methodological issues. Does that mean that the idea that this type of transmission occurring is false? No. It means we still have to do more research to know how much of a factor airborne transmission is and under what conditions it occurs.

Coronavirus,foq583k,t1_fopmdda,1587983447.0,"If you combine mass testing with social distancing and mandatory facemask requirements for the general public, you can control and trace clusters without having to wait until people are dying to identify that there's a cluster. If people do get severely ill, it's much easier to treat them and provide the best odds of survival since the hospitals won't be overwhelmed meaning that the ratio of ICU nurses/doctors to severely ill Covid patients will be much lower. This is important since Covid patients are very fragile and need constant attention to keep them stabilized since their vitals tend to crash and just go all over the place. When ICU staff is overwhelmed by a flood of patients or is unequipped with proper PPE they can't keep a close eye on these patients, which means that they can't respond in time when their patients' condition tanks.

For example, I live in a dense neighborhood of an already densely populated European city and it's impossible to not be aware that there's a pandemic going on. You hear the constant ambulance sirens, you hear people coughing in the row houses around you, at the beginning before the lockdown measures you would see really disturbingly sick people in public from time to time.

I'm not sure if you are a researcher but I am, and it's disgusting what type of position they've been put in. They need the support of the medical and scientific communities behind them, they need more health experts on their task force, and they certainly don't need people criticizing them for not being able to control a madman that congress hasn't been able to deal with for 4 years now, all while trying to address a global pandemic.

I'm sorry, but this pisses me off so much because if you look at Dr. Birx's facial expressions over the past week it's so obvious that she's terrified because she now fully understands the position she's in and that Trump is blatantly trying to use her as a political pawn to push out figures and data obfuscing the truth.

They look visibly uncomfortable when he says these things but they know if they grab the mic from him they will be replaced by loyalists who'll support whatever comes out of Trump's mouth. Is it worth it to die on that hill when other medical experts can contradict him in real time and they can spar with him later? Especially when their real jobs on this task force should be to formulate effective federal responses for the president to enact, which currently has morphed into trying to find ways to convince Trump to not take actions that will potentially kill hundreds of thousands of Americans.

What would you do if you were an ICU doctor who had to decide which of the two critically ill patients you'll have to turn away since there's only one free ICU bed?

What would you do if you, as a medical professional, had to decide between sacrificing whatever policy influence you have in order to tell a madman, who congress had the responsibility to remove years ago, to fuck off for spreading pseudoscience medical advice that, in this case especially, people don't take seriously, knowing that your action result in your removal and will change nothing? Or potentially sacrificing your credibility in the eyes of people who only watch these press conferences, so that you can remain in a position to prevent the president from enacting insane policies that could lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people?

If anything I think that medical professionals and scientists should be publicly reaffirming and supporting Fauci and Birx each time they spar with Trump. It would show that they aren't two random experts, but instead leaders in the scientific and medical communities that we have to rely on to manage this crisis. So by disagreeing with them, Trump will hopefully be perceived as disagreeing with those entire communities as a whole. I think the symbolism of that will give a lot of his non-core supporters pause as they see the true gravity of what his suggestions imply."
politics,fogkf7n,t1_fog5yxf,1587753690.0,"They're left with a shitty choice, but I think they're trying to play this as best they can tbh. If you've been watching, they will contradict him, just not while he's speaking. I'm pretty sure everyone knows what would happen if they ran up and grabbed the mic from him. Given that they'd be replaced by some right wing pushover, I'm pretty sure they realize that dying on the hill of telling people ""not to drink bleach"" isn't worth it, especially when everyone with a brain is coming out of the woodworks to make public statements  warning people of how dumb of an idea that is.

Yeah, if Trump wasn't completely nuts I'd say go for it and call him out at the moment he's saying this. But I'd imagine that their strategy is to make the trade off of letting Trump show the world he's an idiot so that they don't get removed from positions where they have the power to attempt to stop him from acting on what crazy impulsive policies he wants to enact. Last month Fauci made it very clear in his public statements that Trump's idea of reopening the country on Easter and packing the churches was a horrible idea. There's plenty of similar examples of how they've done their best to redirect Trump's decision making. Dr. Birx was responsible yesterday for convincing Trump to call out Gov. Kemp for reopening Georgia too early.

This is a situation where there appear to be only terrible and less terrible options for how they can react to him spreading dangerous health information. And if I was in their shoes, I'd feel pretty bad about the idea of rage quitting over this particular instance while full well knowing that I was the only thing preventing Trump from enacting policies that would lead to the needless deaths of potentially hundreds of thousands of people.

Besides, Congress should be the one reigning him in at this point. His madness goes so far beyond not understanding basic health concepts. They shouldn't have to sacrifice themselves and ultimately others to call him out when everyone knows he's wrong and presumably everyone also understands that the two of them don't support or condone any of the bullshit he says. Judging by how they've looked during the past few press conferences, they seem to be painfully aware that they risk having their reputation destroyed by continuing to be associated with his task force. I've seen plenty of research conference talks in person, and I've never seen a speaker look anywhere near as uncomfortable as Dr. Birx did during the presentation she gave Saturday when Trump continously interrupted her to stir up anger against Iran and China. But the fact that they've stayed on this long, to me at least, shows that they're willing to take that risk to prevent significantly greater evil. Especially considering that these press conferences make up a small fraction of their actual roles on a task force that was doomed to fail from the beginning. It would be really nice if more medical professionals and scientists were vocally showing solidarity with them when they are able to contradict Trump, since it shows that Fauci and Birx are representatives of those larger communities, which would illustrate that this administration is telling that community as a whole to fuck off.

I truly believe that once the dust settles and the investigations into the response are completed, a clear picture will emerge of Fauci and Birx doing whatever they could to attempt to address a political disaster that all of congress hasn't been able address over the past 4 years. They need more support while they have the influence they currently do, not to resign. Think of the doctors who are making the impossible decision of who lives and who dies due to lack of medical equipment. Fauci and Birx are making the same decisions on a much grander and gut wretchingly fucked up scale but due to lack of intelligence in the White House. If they quit, the last buffer of sanity will have left the task force. The lack of coherent federal response is occurring despite their best efforts, not because of them. If they leave, the new response will definitely become more swift and effective. But it will be solely aimed at improving Trump's election odds."
Coronavirus,focmpnk,t1_fo9ehza,1587673180.0,"Important consideration though is that you are correct, for most critically ill patients require ventilators for a few days. And this is important because mechanical ventilation is a very invasive procedure that can cause damage in and of itself. They are also notorious for causing increasing amounts of damage as you continue to keep patients on them beyond the first few days. The **average** Covid patient who require ventilation will need their vent for anywhere from 1 to upwards of 3 weeks. This is a massive problem and Gov. Cuomo illustrated it very well in his first few press Covid press conferences when he said that his concern about thelack of ventilators was amplified by his concern about the incredibly long duration of use by Covid patients. Specifically he was concerned that this unique feature of Covid would create a second bottleneck one ventilators and ICU availability, and additional he acknowledged that this meant the majority of people getting intubated for ventilators would never come off of them. 

At the time, data from Italy was showing a 50% mortality rate for ventilated Covid patients. As this article and the governor said early this week about the death rate in New York, our data shows at least a 80% mortality rate for ventilated patients. So things turned out even worse than expected.

A few reasons might explain why Italy's numbers looked better. Both are emotionally striking in their own ways. First, health care protocol differs from country and Italy in particular has historically used those hyperbaric helmets you may have seen in the videos from Italian hospitals. Besides looking creepy as fuck, these helmets create a positive pressure environment in the patient's airways that allows for more oxygen to cross into the blood stream.  This allows for doctors to administer less aggressive mechanical ventilator settings which preserves more alveolar function, meaning less lung damage occurs from the ventilators themselves. (When I checked last there was only one company in the US making similar equipment, a small business in Texas. In recent weeks major companies have been offering them anything they need to scale up their manufacturing. It's important to note that these helmets are some what finicky to make, so companies aren't pursuing a buy out since it's essential to preserve the institutional knowledge of the people who've had experience making these things. New employees tend to be local, trusted family, friends, and neighbors who will understand the importance of not cutting corners during manufacturing.)

The second factor that kept Italy's rate at 50% is that they were eventually forced to implement medical triage, meaning that the sickest and oldest patients had to die at home while the younger patients were the ones receiving ventilation. This can also illustrate that low odds of survival still apply to young patients who are ventilated"
politics,fo7zvj3,t1_fo77jbi,1587587417.0,"Yeah I don't doubt you at all that the China shit that politicians and people on social media are spewing is veiled if not explicit racism, especially in the US. My point was that without understanding the context under which the sub name was created, it is very reasonable to imply that the sub was created to explicitly have a racial bias against China. But with the context I gave you, which is my personal experience as well as the experience of others who participated in the sub, it would be inaccurate to say that the intention of people participating in the sub was to foster anti-Chinese sentiment. When the virus spread beyond China, so did the topics of discussion. Again, that is just my impression but I think it would be shared by the majority of the other users who participated in the sub at that time based on the tone and quality of discussion that took place.

You can make the valid argument that still, regardless of the intention and poor wording, the name would imply implicit racism and could be perceived as offensive. I would agree with you that using that name could unintentionally encourage the anti-Chinese sentiment, but I since don't think that was the intention, I believe that the actual intentions are very important to consider in this particular case based on the assertions you're making. The reason I'm saying that is that very few Americans were participating in the sub at that time. Users from Europe, Asia, and Oceania made up the bulk of the sub's followers. I took a quick look at your post history and, correct me if I'm wrong, but you appear to be American. I am also American and from a very progressive part of the US, but moved overseas a few years back. The reason I bring that up is that, after my experience of living outside of the bubble of America culture (it really is a bubble, even the progressive multicultural parts), I've realized it's imperative for more progressive Americans of all backgrounds to be aware that the concepts of implicit/explicit racism as well as the significance of intent vs. perception are talked about very differently in progressive circles outside of the US, and the level of exposure to those types of conversations isn't as prominent as in the US. This isn't inherently good, bad, or whatever, it's just the way things are at the moment and as an individual I cannot change it but I can use that information to help me understand the context behind people's intentions. And it's even more important to keep in mind when deciding how to respond to things you might find problematic in a way that is actually effective at fostering a conversation instead of a shouting match. 

Look, I know this is a long winded response, but this specific example of this sub's name is part of a larger topic that I think needs to be acknowledged and discussed more. Regardless, if Reddit allowed the option to change the names of subreddits, then I would be of the opinion that the name should be changed. But we don't have that option.

So whatever your thoughts are of the current sub is up to you; again, I have no idea if the culture of the sub is different now than before. I'm just trying to give you what my experience of what the culture of the sub was when it was created and why that experience leads me to believe that it would be erroneous to extend the current cultural context of the name retroactively to make assertions that the people involved with the sub at its creation had explicitly racist motivations.


And for the record, I am not right wing, I am not a Trump supporter, I do not use the term China Virus when talking about SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. I just think that your concern about the sub being named that way is a valid and good concern to have. But I also think that illustrating that these types of things aren't black or white and understanding the history and context for this stuff is also very important. If there is an ability to make corrections to make something less offensive, then that should happen. If there are not, then that's a different more nuanced discussion, but I firmly believe that it's wrong to then go back and label the people who were involved in the sub as knowingly promoting racism when that wasn't the case and it doesn't help make you right or the world a better place."

It was just kind of a sarcastic name that in hindsight wasn't a good idea, but there wasn't an malicious intent as far as I was aware. It was just the largest sub at the time related to COVID-19 (a name which didn't even exist at that time) that people were using to try to share info and get a clearer picture of what was going on. The first few weeks of the outbreak were very opaque in terms the quality of info coming out of China. It was a mostly international community and a lot of people who were in China at the time.

Idk, I haven't checked out the sub in over a month so maybe rightwingers took it over when Trump started pushing the concept himself. I know that's happened with other subs in the past. But at least in January and early February when I was visiting it, it was just normal conversation about what was happening around the world, albeit not all the people commenting where the most scientifically literature. But it wasn't like there was far right misinformation going around, more like people who didn't have a lot of prior knowledge about biology/epidemiology who were having trouble interpreting some of the initial primary medical literature that was coming out. Which was itself really messy since no one in the medical field knew how this would play out and a lot of the literature was being posted before it could be peer reviewed since news was moving so fast then."
COVID19,fo67x59,t1_fo3ma2i,1587549888.0,"Yup, the scientific community seems to be going for quantity over quality at the moment, which is understandable.

It was nice having some real data to look at but none of it had been peer reviewed so it was hard to make anything concrete out of it besides that people get sick, cough, are really infectious, their lungs have seen better days, and when they do die, they tend to all want to die at the same time and need a fuck ton of medical care throughout the process of trying to save them, so people should maybe be concerned about that and start preparing.

If data were wet sand, the scientific/medical community studying Covid right now would be the equivalent of a bunch of people throwing buckets full of wet sand onto a pile as fast as they can with that hope that one day someone will have the time to come and turn their giant wet sand pile into a sand castle."

COVID19,fo2h6mt,t1_fnzjyhm,1587462288.0,"Yeah, it will be nice to see some real data to confirm what most people following the epidemiological aspect of this have been assuming for a while, which is basically that the amount of mild and asymptomatic cases have been more widespread than what our data has been able to show so far. I'm guess the undercount is mostly due to lacking of resources for widespread testing, inaccurate tests, and people with mild to no symptoms not wanting to go out of their way to get tested when they felt it to be either unnecessary or a waste of medical resources. And then getting a better picture of what factors, if any, help predict some of the more unexpected symptoms the virus causes; neurological damage being what I'm personally most curious about. 

A lower mortality rate would also be nice to confirm, though it still seems that the mortality rate is very dependent on the availability of medical support, and I'm worried what the death toll will look like in developing countries where there aren't a lot of options to help critically ill patients.

In regards to the psychological aspect of the pandemic, mainly the challenge of convincing people to take precautions against something that they may feel will not have obvious, direct impacts on their lives, I am worried that if people....say angry conservatives in the US...start to hear that the mortality rate is lower than what they were originally told, this is just going to reinforce their thoughts that the social restrictions were all an overreaction or plot against them. I think that will lead a lot of people with that mindset to stop listening to and trusting any of the public health information they're being told, and they'll basically abandon any attempts at social migration strategies since they will be under the assumption that such actions aren't useful or that the virus is ""fake news"". This should be good news but I hope this doesn't lead to a shit show in the US, especially if certain politicians start criticizing medical experts."

If you remember back in February when there was that huge right wing gun rights protest in Virginia, a few days beforehand federal authorities arrested and seized weapons from a bunch of white supremists who were planning a terrorist attack during the protest to incite civil unrest. In the monitored communications and legal statements the members made, they stated their plan was to start shooting at Trump supporters (who they even called mindless idiots), the Antifa counter protesters, and the police monitoring the whole thing. Their aim was perform the attack covertly so each group would think that the rival groups were the ones attacking them, causing them to all turn on eachother. They also mentioned that the current political climate in the US is like a tinder box waiting for a match, and I think they are completely right about that, unfortunately.

I'm concerned that similar groups will take advantage of these protests to do something similar. I guarantee that 95% of these militia idiots are going to immediately regret their decisions if they actually try to overthrow the government and disrupt society. I'm pretty sure their ideas of what civil unrest and societal collapse are like is all based on disaster movies, and they picture themselves as the seemingly invincible protagonists. Turns out that in reality, destroying your society really fucking sucks and isn't like the movies, but once you open that box it's really hard to shut it and just go back to normal again.

But on this particular topic, I also am pretty familiar with benzo withdrawal....and even with cold turkey withdrawals, bilateral pneumonia that requires a medically induced coma and ventilation for 8 days is not consistent at all with benzo withdrawals. I know the dude travels a bit as well as his family. Based on the timing, I'm wondering if he got an early case of COVID-19? I know it's a stretch, but we do have evidence, based on strain lineage tracking derived from following mutations, that the disease had been spreading undetected outside of China through asymptomatic carriers during January on the West Coast and Europe, outside of that initial cluster in Germany. Also there were pneumonia deaths during that period that in hindsight look suspicious. It's important to note that none of these were confirmed cases, besides the initial German cluster. It's just based on the timeline that mutations in the virus occurred and were passed onwards, which allows you in draw conclusions on when the virus was introduced into a new region of the world. 

I've been following the whole early Covid spread hypothesis with caution and only going off the peer reviewed data provided from accredited institutions, especially since a lot of conspiracy theorists are pushing the idea pretty hard with unfounded claims and saying they had it back in November, which is completely unfounded. But January? It's unlikely but not outside the realm of possibility.

Edit: The neurological issues he's still experiencing could be explained both by cold turkeying benzos and by being on a vent for so long. It sounds like he was on it for 8 days, which again is consistent with Covid since most ICU patients are only on vents for 1-3 days, but Covid patients are notorious for being on vents for 1-3 weeks, if not longer. Being on a vent for that long creates a lot of neurological issues down the road for these patients since the longer you keep patients on vents, the higher the risk of developing post ICU delirium. This condition being seen in critically ill Covid patients who've recovered at the rate and level of severity that physicians were concerned about.

Hell, I even thought I was further along with addressing my own insecurities.

 Instead, I learned that moving half way around the world to a foreign country  where you don't have any prior connections, support system, or fluency in the local language, for a very competitive graduate school program, and then proceeding to fall in love, start living together way too soon, breaking up half a year later while *still* living together beyond that for an additional 4 months due to a housing shortage, during which time she starts fucking around with other people while trying to keep you emotionally close as a fall back option, all at the same time that all of your new friends are out traveling for the summer, is an amazing way to learn whether you have any type of insecurities or unaddressed psychological issues.

The spread, if the lung do get infected enough to develop severe pneumonia, typically starts at the base of the lungs in the alveoli (the little clusters where oxygen and CO2 transfer takes place) and creeps upwards towards the upper parts of the lungs, progressively get more and more dangerous. Obviously there are individual differences so, if hospitals in your area aren't overwhelmed, at least call a primary care physician and see if it makes sense to go to the ER. 

That being said, this if you're at the point that you are pretty convinced you have pneumonia, do not attempt to treat this on your own. Severe COVID-19 is way too dangerous for that. Around the 1-2 week mark after symptoms first present is when severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome tends to set in, and some patients even report feeling better in the day or two prior their transition to this stage of the disease. This situation is very serious and requires urgent care since patients can deteriorate extremely quickly, meaning within hours. Treat getting help with the urgency you would a heart attack

So if you are really having a hard time breathing, call an ambulance asap. It's better than having someone drive you unless the hospital is literally right around the corner and the ambulance will be delayed significantly. But check with whoever you're speaking to on the 911 line about this and see what they would advise; they will give you accurate information that pertains to your specific situation. I'm just an internet stranger trying to give an overview on all of this. 

The reason I caution against having a family member drive you there is because at that stage of the disease your condition will be very fragile and unstable and things can go from bad to worse very quickly and unpredictably. So making the transition to the hospital, without medical support provide by EMS/fire responders can be very destabilizing. I can't state enough that things can deteriorate extremely quickly and too many people have died from trying to wait an extra day, just to see if things improve on their own.

Researchers are discovering that the mind-body connection is a very real thing, despite the amount of pseudoscience floating around on that topic, and we're learning more and more about this by studying people like him and Buddhist monks, as well as the somatic symptoms that have historically been reported by patients suffering from mental illness that physicians had been dismissing as nonsensical. 

I'm not sure if he's aware of it, but a lot of the techniques that Wim Hof has developed are very similar to techniques that monks have used for centuries to alter their physically state at will. This obviously isn't magic or like crazy superhuman powers stuff that a lot of pseudoscience people claim it to be, but it's still a significant and meaningful phenomenon that should be investigated. I'm happy that more reputable researchers are researching the validity of this stuff, rather that fringe ""scientists"" and armchair conspiracy theorists."
Residency,fn4g1cg,t1_fn0oc44,1586640639.0,"Would it be possible for you to stay at an AirBnB if you get called in? I know in some countries AirBnB hosts are renting out their units at reduced prices for health care works so they don't have to risk infecting their families. The tourism industry is obviously dead at the moment, so it's a way for them to help and get some income. I think in a few areas they will rent them for free and get reimbursed by the government, but I never looked into that more.

I feel you though. I'm doing graduate school in Germany but I'm from the US. My research is medically related so even though I'm not in med school to be an MD, our program is a part of the med school at my university and I would spend all my time in research labs at our Uni Klinik collaborating with MDs. So I'm at least more familiar with the this whole situation from a medical and epidemiological standpoint than your average research person. A lot of my fellow international colleagues went home before it became difficult to travel, but me and my fellow American friends here are all riding it out in Europe since Germany is very safe right now and the situation in the US is...I mean I'm sure you've been following the news. 

But anyways, even if things were better back home, I have the same type of worries you have and really feel for you and your family. I have no place to stay back in the US besides my parents' place. My sister has an autoimmune disorder that she can find meds for anymore (fuck you Trump for encouraging people to hoard that shit). And my dad has hereditary heart disease and hypertension. He's very healthy and active, not overweight, and his condition is well managed, but still he's high risk and I can't imagine the guilt I'd feel if come home and infecting them. I think it's hard for my family to understand why I won't come back since the miss me and are worried about me. 

It's hard for me too. It's been over 18 months since I was home last and I lost my grandpa, who I was close with, while I was living here and couldn't get back for the funeral. My grandma who I'm even closer with is 93, has a pacemaker, and lives in an independent assisted care facility. Besides the pacemaker and her age, she's a strong, physically active woman who in normal times has a better social life than I do. But still, I'm hopeful but realistic about how this might effect my family and feel helpless to a certain degree. I wish I could have made it back for Christmas this past year to see everyone together again. 

At least I was able to convince them to self isolate way before Trump started to take it seriously and no one understood serious the whole thing was. My family was actually planning on fucking flying through a major international airport to go see and stay with my grandma for a week, staying with her at her apartment, just as the cases in those Washington assisted living centers popped up. I wasn't aware they were planning on traveling until I called them after I watched Trump give an crazy interview that made me realize this pandemic would slam the US, like way worse than I'd originally thought. My original intention was just to call to check in with my parents and tell them not to listen to the president, to follow updates from the Cleveland Clinic and Mayo Clinic for accurate info (Fauci and Brix weren't in the picture yet), and to tell my dad he needed to start working from home asap. Then they told me about their travel plans and if it was safe, and I literally started screaming to cancel that shit asap. I called them back every day for the next 4 days to make sure they actually canceled their flights. My dad's boss was pretty proactive also and the day after I called my dad, his boss said he was worried about him and while he was going to be moving the whole company to work remotely over the next week, he wanted to have my dad back at home after their meeting. Luckily he does IT consulting for a major biomedical company that specializes in human biological specimen testing, so at least he should have job security.

Sorry, that was a huge tangent but I guess I needed to vent more than I originally thought I did... I'm really hoping the best for you and your family"
Residency,fn3v7qx,t1_fmwddxw,1586628560.0,"Isn't Austria going to be easing social restrictions soon? I'd be really concerned about a resurgence of cases, except this time more evenly distributed across the country since the only thing preventing active carriers from starting new infection clusters is the social restrictions. And I'm guessing that infected people were traveling around the country to get to whatever little small village they call home while they still could so they could quarantine with their families. Idk, so you see this as a possibility or do you think the infections are still mostly contained to the hotspots that were active before the lockdown?

I'm currently living in North Rhine-Westphalia and obviously the infections are pretty widely distributed here. For the two weeks before this past week, at least in Köln, everyone got really serious about the lockdown and you could tell it was having an impact just based on the amount of ambulance sirens and people you heard hacking their lungs up outside or from within their houses (I live in a very densely populated part of the city). Also, way less young people who were obviously sick walking around outside,which is good since they are the most mobile and most likely to spread the virus. This past week though the weather got nice though and people started going outside again. Now the ambulance sirens are back, as well as the coughing, including from younger people again. I'm concerned that this is gonna kick up the number of infections again, but I guess we'll see in two weeks."
facepalm,fn3piqw,t1_fmljaaf,1586625391.0,"The reason why everyone in the US (and the world, it just seems like the US is struggling with this concept still) is staying home right now is to space out the spread of the virus so that cities and towns all across the nation aren't peaking all at roughly the same time. Instead, it will spread more slowly at a hopefully more controlled pace so that the healthcare system doesn't collapse. You do realize that this is the reason why every hospital isn't overwhelmed right now, right? Please tell me you realize this..."

I also had a student janitor job that I'd work from like 6pm-12am each night, and I was doing a round in the old Mathematics department building on the coldest night of that year. There were 4 or 5 floors in the building and each had a bunch of smaller classrooms. I was working alone and when I'd walk down a hallway every now and then you'd see someone dip down the stairwell or something like that, just as you were walking around the corner. The homeless on campus were basically hiding in the buildings to stay warm and playing hide and seek with the custodial crews to not get kicked out"
