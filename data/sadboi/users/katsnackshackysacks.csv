If you are not a picker, you might get through it. Everyone’s body reacts differently though and you might get through the transition with minimal or no breakouts.

My skin did eventually calm down, seemingly on its own, and today I still get one or two mildly painful zits around my time of the month but it is not nearly as bad and very manageable with a healthy lifestyle and skincare.

vegan,fr4pqr3,t1_fr4lda6,1589894325.0,"I think you are offering a valid explanation as to why people treat dogs and sheep are different. But as you said, that’s not a moral justification.

 People in this group are concerned for the welfare of animals at the expense of human luxury. Why should anyone care if a caveman took his dog went hunting for antelope with him 5000 years ago? The perpetuation of animal agriculture and it’s toxicity is rife with excuses. Yes, human existence depended on the domestication of farmed animals for a long time. But today, no one *needs* bacon or an angora wool sweater. If you care for your dog but eat hamburgers, you don’t actually care about animals, you just like how they make you feel.

I understand why people eat meat and how the cognitive dissonance has allowed many generations of genuinely well-meaning people to eat animals that they would personally never want to kill them selves. I really appreciate you taking a stand with these facts and I’m sorry no one else is on your level. You bring up a lot of important points, even from a vegan perspective.

Rosacea,fr4n50w,t3_gm35qm,1589892632.0,"Coola fragrance free. I’m honestly not sure if it’s chemical or mineral but it applies really nicely and light enough to layer moisturizer. I’m pretty sure they have a sweat-proof formula.

Also I tried Purito green level fragrance free from yesstyle. I stopped using it because I broke out while using it, but it didn’t sting or flare up my redness at all like a lot of sunscreens do. It doesn’t have comedogenic ingredients, just didn’t agree with me or maybe another product I use. It feels very nice on the skin and I know a lot of people love it, so it’s worth a mention.

If anyone is in my situation, I’ve had some luck with The Ordinary and the any fragrance-free item from Cosrx. For people who like Cerave moisturizers for the body, Ceramidx (sp?) is another fragrance-free option with the same ceramides without questionable animal stuff.

EatingDisorders,foctvcz,t3_g6i33m,1587675801.0,"Don’t be hard on yourself. No one really asks to grow up with 99.9% of their headspace taken up by thoughts of shame, poor body image, and calories. I get what you mean about your nostalgia for your eating disorder and wanting to be hospitalized. You want all of that effort and that part of your identity to be fully realized. Since you are never happy with your body, it’s the only way of knowing that you’ve pushed as hard as you can. I’ve been in a very similar position. But I am also in a rare position of being able to say that after 15 years or so of dealing with ED I have finally come through to the other side. Once you have both feet on solid ground, you don’t miss the ED any more. 

It is still a part of my identity because every day I think about how much I used to struggle, but I am so distanced from those memories. It makes me appreciate life more. The fact that I can even go on this sub without feeling triggered is huge. This freedom feels like laying in the sun. I don’t know how else to describe it.

I think the best thing you can do for yourself and your sister is keep focusing on your own recovery. Try your best not to engage with her disparaging comments and get better. Work on creating a household climate where eating healthy and enjoying meals is a norm. Don’t let her see you cry or pinch parts of your body that you’re unhappy with. Just stay aware of your behavior when you are out and about. Maybe one day you can show her that life doesn’t really start until you’re done with your eating disorder. All that self loathing, obsession, and energy spent thinking about what to eat/not eat is really destructive to relationships. You can’t expect to help her if you can’t help yourself.

PM me if you want to know about my recovery. Professional help never helped me much, at least not directly so I am happy to lend insight. I’ve cycled through a few different diagnoses."

abortion,fnnc7kq,t3_g2qy7l,1587089065.0,"Sorry you are feeling this way. But reading your thoughts it sounds like you made the right choice. You and your partner are both unsure of whether you want kids. Also, I think it’s worth pointing out here that you list primarily selfish reasons for wanting a kid... for your own fulfillment. To provide a vicarious experience through your child. For someone to love and look up to you. Don’t get me wrong- that doesn’t mean you can’t be a great parent. But if that’s really what you want, I think you should evaluate your mindset before you decide.  Your feelings are not a good basis for bringing an emotional, autonomous and sentient being into this world. I think a lot of people have families because it’s what they want, or because they think it’s just the norm, without really thinking about how they want to raise their kids and more importantly, why, and it can be problematic. It’s just not fair to hold kids accountable for our happiness, even if that isn’t our intention. Just food for thought.

Also, you are not old! Maybe you won’t have 8 kids but you don’t need to start right away if you want a family. You still have time to conceive, *and* time to think about it too. Don’t compare yourself to your happy pregnant friends. Everyone makes their own choices at their own pace and that’s fine! It’s okay to grieve, but you don’t have to feel like all is lost if all you *do* want as a family. You can still have that. Or you might not. That’s all what the concept of family planning is for.

YES, we live in a society where sex is overly valued and poorly portrayed, especially for confused/naive/hormonal/impressionable teenagers in need of social acceptance. Everything is sexualized and young people these days have a warped sense of healthy relationships. 

But teenagers naturally have curiosities about sex, which is normal and healthy. Sex positivity can also be used as a tool to have more open conversations about how to treat partners, how you should expect to be treated, how to balance a sexually active life and keep a healthy mind and healthy boundaries, and learn how to be honest about what feels right for every individual. Sex positivity just means it’s okay to have and enjoy sex- nothing more and nothing less. I would not construe every message that is “hyper-sexualized” as “sex positive.”

I think if young people are raised with awareness on what realistic, healthy sexual relationships actually look like, then they might be better equipped to know what they want and seek that out- whether that be one or few serious relationships or many casual ones.


Besides, how do you suppose we get rid of promiscuity culture? It’s not okay to pressure anyone into having a lot of sex but it’s not any more fair to stop them from exploring sex either.

 
I am happily married to my husband and he is enough, but that alone doesn’t make me regret or resent any of my past experiences. People’s wants and needs change and everyone is entitled to that, so long as they aren’t harming anyone else.

It’s also not anyone else’s obligation to avoid topics that make you uncomfortable either in many social settings. That includes sex stuff. 

Honestly, I had a lot of casual sex in college. And a lot of those experiences put me in situations where I didn’t feel like I could defend my boundaries and I did things that I wasn’t comfortable with and with guys who generally treated me badly. It messed me up for a long time. Instilled some really self depreciating behavior and exacerbated my depression. But the fact is that I allowed to get myself into those situations. I made choices about the people I hung around and I willingly subscribed to the idea that being desired by men would make me feel better about myself. No one “made” me do those things and the culture in general did not inflict my trauma.

To be clear, the partners who gave me the worst time left the most immediate and hurtful impact. But after I healed for a while I remembered that I had many other partners who I really liked and was even friends with. I consider my time with them to be valuable. I’m sorry if you had no positive experiences, but many other people do.

A lot of people don’t like promiscuity culture and I think there are a lot of valid reasons why. But I don’t see how it is solely or primarily responsible for your trauma. I just sense a lack of accountability on your part is all."
antifeminists,fmfse9f,t3_fux248,1586033859.0,I don’t think “promiscuity culture” gave you emotions trauma. That is separate from sexual predation.
BodyPositive,fmepp5n,t3_fpitvt,1586010655.0,You look soooo cute and glowy
BodyPositive,fmep8pb,t3_ft8ugk,1586010338.0,"Keep it. I didn’t used to love body hair but I love to run my hands through my husband’s chest hair. For me personally, when I find the person attractive, stuff like body hair hardly matters. I love that you like keeping it natural."
PurplePillDebate,fmemeqr,t1_fmekjvf,1586008272.0,"That’s something I think on often because it’s kind of what I strive for when working, but I don’t think it’s quite possible. “Put together” for a woman also means being bright-eyed and clear complected, two conventionally-pretty qualities that my pastey face doesn’t have.

I do think that makeup can be soooooo subtle that you can tell there is a difference but can’t quite pinpoint what it is. That doesn’t mean the prettiness isn’t there though."
PurplePillDebate,fmejyld,t1_fmejkvx,1586006284.0,"I have a kind of unconventional job that requires traveling to many different facilities and public venues. I do think makeup doesn’t just look pretty, but also more presentable/put together, which is something I want to achieve since I represent my organization to the public. I do 100% choose to do so, but it still *feels* like an obligation."
PurplePillDebate,fmeivvn,t1_fmeg2kc,1586005346.0,"That’s kind of exactly what I mean. I personally can go many days without makeup to give my skin a break and so I don’t lose sight of what I look like, but I also often experiment with makeup at home and wear it around the house when no one is there. I also routinely leave my house without makeup probably as often as I put on makeup at home. The one time I feel obligated to wear makeup is for work, but I keep that to a pretty minimal 5-minute routine. Otherwise it’s just fun/creative/whatever."

medical,fmdeeit,t3_fukhow,1585965731.0,"I know you said you eat well, but no specifics. Some causes can be overeating, an excessively fatty diet, not enough fiber, dehydration (to name a few). I think you should try to talk to a doctor since this seems to be an ongoing problem. In the meantime, try eating some more fruits/veggies/whole grains and drinking some water. Not too much caffeine but some green tea or something else gentle may help. Laxatives might offer temporary relief but be very careful NOT to overuse, maybe reserve for the last resort. Again, these are suggestions to try for immediate relief. Try visiting your doctor."

EatingDisorders,fmdbpop,t3_fu8zzd,1585963874.0,"Absolutely. I think there should be more awareness as to what eating disorders actually look like, because they don’t often fit neatly into categories. They are very complex and sometimes can be very hard to identify, let alone treat. You are not alone!"

PurplePillDebate,fk9iezb,t3_fh80ec,1583976700.0,"Literally has happened to me and I did not care. Also, someone being upset about their man having been with another man does not equate a woman having many sexual partners and I don’t see how it is supposed to."
