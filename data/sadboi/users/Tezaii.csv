Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fmcrdat,t3_fu4o79,1585951297.0,"I'm in the same boat as you. I have witnessed things changing or being out of place, as well. I committed suicide 3 years ago. There is no way I could have possibly survived taking over 400 psych pills that night, but I woke up the next morning . I had another instance of dying in a car crash, and got this weird feeling I was in a coma elsewhere. It used to be really difficult and traumatizing to remember that somewhere else I'm in a coma and my family is grieving because I havent woken up from it yet."

BPD,fjbsvje,t1_fjbsccg,1583200687.0,"Ending the friendship? When reading your posts, and having recently left my relationship, I realized i should have never ignored the red flags in the beginning. First one was that she wasnt very open with her communication to me. If you're already seeing red flags with him,  I wouldn't pursue dating or being a couple. Those behaviors I learned from current ex, usually will not change. 

So, I would say just do what you need to for your own peace of mind."

Also, I'm like 98% sure my girlfriend is a narcissist. She has cheated on me 7 times,.and I cant leave her long enough to actually move on. I love her to pieces. The sad things is, I have been questioning if I am a narcissist too. I've been diagnosed BPD, but it makes me wonder if I was misdiagnosed and instead I am a narcissist."
