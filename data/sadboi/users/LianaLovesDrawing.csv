splatoon,fr3grei,t1_fr3glgp,1589857081.0,Nah everytime it's happened at least one person tries to actually get the objective. My team fucking lost when the other team had 3 members because they were so shit ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I guess some people just hope for a fluke like that to happen

splatoon,fr233f0,t1_fr1sbf7,1589830320.0,I am because I'm sick wasting my time on a battle I'm guaranteed to lose. And it's kinda not fair that the opposing team gets an easy win js
splatoon,fr22ztm,t1_fr1ygpm,1589830271.0,Because it's pointless wasting your time on a match that you're going to lose as it's near impossible to win if someone dc's. And it's not fair because the winning team still gets the KO bonus and points if they win
splatoon,fr22u5q,t1_fr21ms5,1589830193.0,Omg no i would've actually rage quit and get banned before letting it take my s+ rank
splatoon,fr1lhfb,t1_fr0545i,1589821795.0,No because team A worked harder in the 5 minutes provided to get the win. You can't expect to piss about doing a shit job during the run then having over time to fall back on so you can put in your all for the last second and steal team A's victory. If team A worked damn hard to win yet team B snatches their win last second then how is that fair to team A then? Basically disregarding all their hard work. If they couldn't beat them in the 5 minutes provided then why do they deserve another chance? And if they wiped them out last second but couldn't during the 5 minutes then obviously that was a fluke and they don't deserve the win.
LuigisMansion3,fr1kjar,t1_fr1gllg,1589821315.0,Maybe but I didn't use it when that guy found the room and couldn't find the key even though it was right next to him. Then again scare scraper is really glitchy

splatoon,fr11ine,t1_fr0kynn,1589811417.0,Yeah it's hard being at the bottom when you're stuck with the new players who most likely didn't read the rules. But yeah you just have to stick with it for a bit and get higher so you can hopefully get a better team

I'm the one who goes around and gets a football and throws it but has my team mates not follow me to the post to throw clams or get the football off me incase the enemy gets me.

Personally I like to use the bucket weapons, I just got the explosher and I love it because its got an amazing range so you can move fast using ink but it's got a large surface area when you hit directly below which is awesome for hitting enemies below. But to be honest idk what happened with that team, I've never had such an awful team like that but like I said I think one started screaming boo ya and the rest must've died and respawned by them or something. But it doesnt really matter, just frustrating"

I feel the issue with the team mates I described is that they weren't even after the tower, I think one shouted boo ya for some reason and the rest followed. The opposing team was average if I'm honest, just the fact that it was 1 against 4 for a bit that made them so strong."

But yeah I mainly skip them because I'm the kind of person who can do it but I need to play the level a couple times to get used to it (I just got my first console ever last christmas) but because you have to pay, it's just easier to pay to win than waste all my credits building up to a genuine win."

Or if you want to try solo it or have another friend who can join you, just go onto online then friends and create room then get your nephew to join it. But unfortuately you do need an nintendo membership to play online scarescraper, the DLC pack is pretty shit, all it does is let your Luigi change outfit and sometimes it changes the room to the theme of your outfit but it barely even happens."
