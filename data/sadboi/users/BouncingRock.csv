So they're being mean and nasty to get national attention? Sound like if that's their reason, then they're not doing it because they are bitter/jealous."
changemyview,fprcrup,t1_fprbpil,1588850416.0,"Agreed on the first point, and I would like to change it to include men/non-binary: ""People will talk shit about how anybody and everybody looks, irrespective of their age/weight/gender. People are mean/nasty and speculating about why they are mean and nasty is a much bigger conversation than the specific example of Adele's weight loss.""

For point #2: To quote Rob McElhenney (from ""Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") about his weight loss transition, this is how he described it:

""Look, it's not that hard. All you need to do is lift weights six days a week, stop drinking alcohol, don't eat anything after 7 p.m., don't eat any carbs or sugar at all, in fact just don't eat anything you like, get the personal trainer from *Magic Mike*, sleep nine hours a night, run three miles a day, and have a studio pay for the whole thing over a six to seven month span.""

A good test would be to see how these internet haters respond when they see someone who is not a rich celebrity (just a normal person) losing weight and see if they are mean and nasty to them as well. Given the circumstances, I don't think you have enough evidence to support your claim that they are bitter because they are jealous. You would first need to rule-out all the other reasons people on the internet might be mean/nasty towards a someone who has lost weight, and look at how they respond to non-celebrities who lose weight as a control group."
changemyview,fpray6i,t3_gf3pqa,1588848689.0,"I don't want to speculate too much about how people feel or why they say the things they do, but I could try to provide a slightly different perspective.

First - People love to talk/write about women's appearances. (Good, bad, ugly.) Even women working in politics have to answer questions about their hair and wardrobe *from reporters*. It doesn't matter if a celebrity gains weight/loses weight/gets a boob job/wears a hat/has shoes/etc. There will be people who will find a way to be mean and nasty about their appearance. I think we can just agree that people can and will be nasty about how a woman looks regardless of the situation.

Second - Assuming that people are being nasty specifically towards Adele because they are jealous (and not just because that's the internet).

We can probably agree that Adele has access to more resources than the average person on twitter. She can hire a personal trainer, has a lot more access to delicious and healthy food, could hire a personal nutritionist, has a big support structure, etc. With everything she has, weight loss is much easier and attainable goal for her than for your average person.

Praising her for weight loss could be seen as praising a billionaire for building a huge mansion. Sure, there's some work, planning and sacrifices involved, but at the end of the day it's totally achievable with the resources they have.

Now look at this from the perspective of someone who *doesn't* have all these resources. They could think, ""Oh look, another wealthy person getting praised for using their wealth to get something they wanted."" Bitterness doesn't just stem from jealousy. It can also come from inequality. Granted, attacking someone personally is never the right way to open up a discussion about inequality and access to resources. But that could be the root of their discontent."
changemyview,fpr8rqa,t1_fpquo82,1588846510.0,"Just a fun add on: The show on Netflix ""100 Humans"" had an episode where people were taught a skill (plate spinning) and then before their first performance the judge was randomly assigned to praise them or criticize them. They were then given a few more hours of practice before their second performance. What happened is the people who were praised improved from their first performance, while the people who were criticized *performed much worse* than they had originally*.*

Obviously this is not a scientific experiment, though they did bring on an expert who explained that yes indeed, people respond and improve much more when given praise (*Good job! Keep up the good work!*) than when given criticism (*You suck, if you don't improve you're gonna die*).

I think it just means that there is an extra layer of trust that needs to be established on case-by-case basis. Even during the Holocaust you had Germans helping Jews. The best way to change the situation is to recognize that there is a problem and become an ally. I personally feel like male allies to ""female"" causes can have such a huge impact because it show that this is bigger than an ""us versus them"" issue.

Before there can be any sort of recovery and healing, there first needs to be 1) An end to the violence 2) Acknowledgement of the violence and 3) Some sort of reparations made to rebalance the power dynamics within the society.

changemyview,foue1ma,t3_g9kspy,1588082266.0,"Instead of thinking about this from a discriminatory/racist perspective (which is largely based on stereotypes), I think it's better to consider it from the point of view of power dynamics.

For instance, instead of talking about women and men, let's talk about the dynamic between black people and the police. The police have a tendency to use more violence on black people than white people - this has been known and shown multiple times. Does this mean that black people who are extra cautious around police are discriminatory? No. It means there is a history of violence and abuse of power, and they are responding accordingly because they want to live.

Now, is there a history in the US of muslim men in positions of authority using systematic violence and abuse of power towards, say, white dudes (with the only excuse being, ""they were white and I don't trust them."") Nope, that's not the case.

But there is a history of violence and abuse by men against women. Not all that long ago, domestic violence and beating up your wife was considered kosher by society. That's not to say that all men are like this, and it's not to say that women can't be propagators of violence and abuse against men.

Your story could just have easily been about a rape survivor who was disowned by his/her family when they came forward about being raped and committed suicide as a result.

I think there is this misconception that the rape ""accuser"" is treated like a brave and heroic warrior while the ""accused"" is treated like an evil malignant demon. But this is often not the case. It can just as easily be reversed. (""Him? But he's such a nice young man! How dare you say something so nasty about him. You wanted it, and even if you did't, then you deserved it for always dressing like a slut and tempting him. He would never do something like without being provoked."")

Based on what I know and what I've read, I have no idea why someone would want to ruin their life by accusing someone of rape unless it actually happened. Granted, there are crazy people out there who do insane things, and false reporting is a crime. But your proposed policy would just be further discouragement to victims (especially child victims who come forward as adults) who are still unsure how to characterize what they experienced. Not only do they have to be worried about getting disowned by their family, but now they have to worry about getting prosecuted for the crime they endured."

You were the messenger. Have you ever read the book, ""Trauma and Recovery"" by Judith Herman?

When he published these findings, Freud was strongly shamed by his colleagues for suggesting something so icky (""how dare you suggest that these women from such good families were sexually abused!"") Freud retracted these beliefs and replaced them with the much better accepted, ""hysteria is just latent female sexual fantasies"" (turns out....he was right the first time...)

It's funny how 150 years later....things haven't changed all that much...

I'm a person with PTSD and I'm in a relationship. I have triggers, and I don't like to be touched while fighting.

I need an hour before I'm less mad and feel OK talking."" When I don't feel good because of my mental health, I let him know. (""I'm having a bad trauma day,"" for instance.)

My mental health has never prevented my partner and I working through things constructively. I have never used my mental health as an excuse for my actions and behavior. I've never used getting triggered as an excuse to blow-up at him more.

We cannot control how we feel, but we can control how we react when we feel those emotions. We cannot control our thoughts, but we can control our behavior and how we interact with others.

Third: The things she says to you are not ok.

Their reaction has nothing to do with you or what you experienced. It only speaks to them and how good they are at handling difficult news."

And, when people do bad things, isn't it ALWAYS the fault of the person on the receiving end? (sarcasm. But legit, a lot of people think this way, and its infuriating.)

It's crazy to me how often people will blame the person who received the abuse for the abuse. I think we (as humans) want to live in a world governed by justice, and it's hard for us to understand why someone would be treated so badly....if they never did anything wrong. (Exactly what you experienced.) It's tough to accept that people do bad things, and there is no rhyme or reason. Just...they do bad things because that's how they are.

She's essentially an ostrich with her head in the sand believing that if she doesn't acknowledge what happened, life can continue as is. Acknowledging the abuse would force things to change, which she doesn't want.

The problem with that is... it happened. If you remember it, then it happened. Your mom being in denial doesn't make it go away. (Like how when someone dies,  certain loved ones will be in denial and refuse to acknowledge the death happened. But denial doesn't change anything.)

This is the shitty part people don't tell you about when you come forward about abuse: just how many people will deny your experience because it makes them uncomfortable and they don't want to deal with something so awful. But that doesn't mean you should give up; there are good and supportive people out there, and you just need to find them.

Do you have other people you trust (outside your immediate family) whom you can talk to? Or a counselor?"

Kayaking,fm800wk,t3_ftm1ep,1585840191.0,"Looks like you've been initiated into whitewater! As someone (30F) who flips frequently, here's what I can recommend.

1. Get comfortable flipping and escaping your boat. Start in flat water (like a lake) and wear a snorkle mask so that you can see when you're underwater (and don't have water coming up your nose.) Try to stay for \~10 seconds before getting out of your boat. Bring a friend who can roll you up just in case!
2. Learn how to roll a kayak. It's a bit weird at first but actually not that hard once it clicks (and super empowering when you get it!)
3. Every time you go out, intentionally flip and roll (weather and location permitting.) I'll almost always start my trip by doing a practice roll in an eddy. That way if/when I flip accidentally, I'm already acclimated to the water temp.
4. When paddling a river, always go in a group of three minimum (that way if someone swims, there is one person to rescue the swimmer and another person to rescue the gear.) Paddling moving rivers alone can be very dangerous, even when there's no rapids! (And always, ALWAYS wear a life jacket and helmet when paddling moving water.)

And if you want to do rivers, consider learning some whitewater 101 (which I saw another person posting about.) Whitewater kayaking is awesome and a great confidence builder!"

changemyview,flqd9d3,t1_flp7p3y,1585389771.0,"On the other hand, I think it's dangerous to tell people that everything will go back to exactly as it was before the assault. We're always growing and changing as people, and we need to recognize the gravity life events have on us in our personal growth. This can be both good events, and bad events. And just like all good and bad events, the impact is dependent on the severity (As an example, a fender bender might make you give more space between you and the car in front of you, but a terrible crash might make you reconsider your life priorities.) Or many not, but I can't make generalizations for billions of people since everyone is different.

As a personal example, the reason I didn't seek help for so long is because people told me that what happened shouldn't have any impact on my life. I was even shamed for going to therapy! People wanted life to continue like it had never happened--unfortunately, it did happen and ""business as usual"" was no longer possible.

You can heal from something. You can move on from something. But that doesn't diminish its significance or impact. And recognizing and appreciating that significance is a necessary step for many people in their journey to heal from what happened.

For the second point....well, it's true in most cases. I would hope that it would encourage victims to fight harder. The mistake I made is assuming that my friends and company would be on my side. If I had known how these things work in the real world, I would have taken a different approach.

I should add this is all from personal experience, books I've read and what I've learned from other victims. Again, a few billion people is hard to generalize for, and it's not my intention to make survivors think that they'll never heal. But I don't want them to feel bad when part of their healing means many aspects of their life have to change, including themselves."
changemyview,floh9c7,t1_flny5jp,1585338274.0,"Yes yes yes and yes. The thing most people don't understand is that getting sexually abused changes everything, forever.  And the predators can just continue to live there life like nothing happened."
changemyview,flo2t4q,t1_flnvluu,1585330570.0,"I should have specified the ""social"" consequences.

Source: I came forward, was shamed/blamed by all my coworkers, had to change jobs and lost all my friends. The abuser face no consequences. I was even shamed/blamed by women who had also been sexually assaulted by the same manager. (I only found out years later that they were also victims.) I've heard many other stories like mine and read a few books by experts about this phenomenon.

The ""Believe Women"" mantra does not pertain to actual legal proceedings; I don't think anyone would argue that the judicial process should be different for victims of sexual assault/rape than for other crimes. Rather, it means that sexual assault cases should be treated more like other crimes.

Imagine a man who was robbed at gun point being told that he deserved to be robbed because he walking around at night, or wearing an expensive watch. Imagine him being told to not talk about getting robbed because it made the gunman look bad. Imagine him being told that getting robbed at gunpoint made his friends like him less, and that he needs to see things from the gunman's perspective. Told ""the gunman's a good guy, he would never do something like that. And even if he did, he probably didn't mean it or you probably deserved it.""

Imagine getting robbed at gunpoint and being told, ""You wanted it.""

Victims of sexual assault are told things like this all the time.

Edit: Grammar and added the ""you wanted it"" line since that's the one that hurts the most. And oh so common."
changemyview,flnqkp7,t1_flnet7x,1585323973.0,"Yes Yes Yes and Yes. The consequences for a woman who chooses to come forward are often significantly worse than what the predator will face....*even when she has mountains of evidence and witnesses.*

This phenomenon of punishing and shaming women who come forward is an excellent example of a psychological phenomenon called ""the backfire effect."" (Basically, our human tendency to shoot the messenger when they provide us with information we don't like. In this case, the 'messenger' is also the survivor.)

Our first reaction is to place the entire burden of blame and guilt on the victim. ""Believe women"" is a reminder that the victims should be considered innocent until proven guilty.

""Innocent until proven guilty"" is the same courtesy we give to people accused of crimes. Unfortunately, it is **not** extended to the victims of sexual assault, who are often told that it was all their fault for x, y, and z and retaliated against for ""poisoning the well."""

relationship_advice,fl0iup3,t3_flew19,1584707803.0,"Sounds like trauma bonding. When someone is in a verbally/emotionally abusive relationship, a great divide grows between the abuser and the abused, in which the abusers becomes almost god-like due to the huge amount of control they gain over their victim through gradually gouging their self esteem away. (Think, Old Testament vengeful and wrathful god who demands worship and obedience from his subjects. Their best chance for survival is....worship and obedience.) The victim also looks of ANYTHING to hang onto (like, Oh, well they were attractive) so that they can feel like the had a bit of control, when really they didn't have any.

There's a few books about recovering from abusive relationships that go through this phenomenon, which seems counter-intuitive but is actually a survival mechanism. (Fight, Flight, Freeze and Faun). I'm sure there's also literature for people who are now in relationships with someone who has been abused in the past."
