BPD,fqgas4q,t3_giltnk,1589341725.0,"my husband said this to me as well, and it hit me hard. I even passed by this post not wanting to read it because I knew I had to. when I think I have come so far, I realize I haven't come far enough. I  love him so much, and I have to work so hard on this. my frustration is toxic when it happens, even though its very rare these days. I know in my past it has been bad. I have had years of therapy, but I still need to keep working hard to really change these behaviors."

BPD,fpt7om8,t3_gf2xyi,1588886313.0,"I have absolutely NO friends at all. I have one that I talk to every month or so, and she basically tells me her problems and that's the end of it. Other than my Husband, I don't have one single friend. No social circle. And I have been unemployed/working from home, for about 6 years. I sometimes think I want a friend, and then I remember all the shitty things ""friends"" have done to me in the past, and I decide I don't want any friends. I know I'm supposed to keep trying, and put myself out there, but I can't do it anymore. I couldn't be honest with anyone, and then why present my inauthentic self to another person. It just feels wrong."

DBTskills,fppphe4,t3_fzjt5j,1588806638.0,"hi and thanks for posting this... I get small snippets of this feeling, the ability to understand that now, nothing bad is happening. I keep dipping into the past in my mind, and I do it all day long. I try so hard to stop thinking about the bad things, and I think you're right about the association with boredom because I was left alone ALOT as a kid, and when my mother would come home, she would always be yelling and screaming at me, so the stillness, and the sudden noises, like hearing the garage door opener, meant she was home, and my whole body would tense up, waiting for the fallout. I didn't do the chores right, I didn't empty the lint out of the dryer, why is this here, why is this there, I thought I told you to wash the floor. What do you mean you did it, this doesn't look clean do it again. omg. you're right. I sometimes wish there was a pill for bad memories. So, yeah, loneliness is good and bad for me."
BPD,fbzax7m,t3_ef7fzs,1577240641.0,"I feel you on this. It’s like a racecar it goes so fast you don’t see it take off. I clench my fists wanting to punch someone or throw something and scream. I have after years of training myself, been able to at least 70% of the time, to breathe my way out of it. To tell myself firmly to deescalate. The trigger being past emotions, exacerbates the current one. So I also tell myself that, you know, it’s not all about this. Yes I am allowed feel a certain way, but breathe or something dangerous and bad is going to happen. And I can usually slow it down."
BPD,fbza90p,t3_ef0vwb,1577240017.0,I’m so sorry for your loss. So very sorry. This time of year is the worst. Sending love.

BorderlinePDisorder,fbve31g,t1_fbtnztq,1577129481.0,"I went to a six week treatment center for my BPD (after a bad triggering incident) to try to get a better grasp on myself, as my therapist and psychiatrist both recommended a “higher level of care” because I had attempted to take my own life, and was taken to the hospital by the police. I went to the treatment center and had a slew of doctors and psychiatrists and therapists of varying methodology. One common thing I heard the entire time I was there, was to separate from my family. They used words like enmeshment and narcissistic and scapegoating and I was overwhelmed with discovering my reality was indeed what I thought. That I wasn’t a piece of crap, it was these people who raised me. But it didn’t sink in then, and I didn’t heed their advice and kept communicating with my family. My family would literally say things like “I think it’s a waste of $20k” and “you’ll forget everything in a month” and “ I think you just wanted a vacation” - no one visited me on family days. I was the ONLY one who had no visitors. I didn’t get cards or letters of encouragement. My therapists get together before release, and tell you what they think. They said we are worried that you’re not understanding that these are toxic people and you need to stay away. They didn’t get it lol, that I couldn’t. Literally. I was so programmed to be their slave, I just couldn’t do it. I even donated eggs to my sister to have a baby. Then she blamed me for the kid having a bad disposition. It took me until age 50 to break away from them.  After they all went to my own granddaughters christening without calling me or even texting me to say are you ok today or hey I’m thinking of you. No.  They went to my granddaughters christening where the baby’s own grandmother wasn’t invited, and didn’t even think twice about it. That’s when I got it. That I was on my own, and I didn’t really have a family. I’ve had more therapists and doctors try to drill into my head, after hearing the horror stories - that it’s not me. I get it. It still hurts. But I’m learning to live again. I feel like I have to make an entirely new life, in order to survive."
BorderlinePDisorder,fbvbow1,t1_fbsubm3,1577128475.0,"I am trying so hard to do just that.  But it’s so hard. I was a nanny most of my life, and I love children (and puppies) more than anything. But after losing out on the granddaughter that was right in my grasp, I would tear up every time I saw a child, walking in the mall, at the park, out to dinner, I would see grandmas and kids, and baby girls, and I’d just bawl. I felt like she had taken away the joy that I used to find in interacting with children. I didn’t want her to have that power over me, so I made sure to sort of wipe that feeling away and recall that children bring me joy, not sorrow. It’s so hard, but I can now play and laugh with babies and it brings me happiness. I always say wistfulness is my enemy. Because in reality, if I were in her life, I would also have to deal with my daughter putting me down in front of her, and it wouldn’t be the peaches and cream ideal that I have in my head. It would be reality and that’s not that pleasant. I have to use radical acceptance in this situation at all times. It is what it is. And here I am, so yes, I need to live my life. We have moved across country, and I’m alone here, I don’t know anyone. But I’m exploring, and trying to focus on what is right for me, and my loving husband. We spend time together when he isn’t working, we walk and explore towns and restaurants and parks together. We enjoy our dogs. There will always be that underlying unease. Mother’s Day. The girls birthdays. The baby’s birthday. Christmas. Easter. Thanksgiving. Anything that reminds me of them, and the deep love I have for them, and always will. It brings tears to my eyes, but with DBT techniques, zen techniques, meditation and the help of a therapist, a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst, and staying on my meds, I haven’t harmed myself, and I haven’t given up, although I have wanted to many, many times. I lost a lot of weight, I look a lot older than I did five years ago, but I’m not going to let this kill me. I have a loving husband and that’s more than many people have, I am grateful. It’s a very thin wire to walk on sometimes."
BorderlinePDisorder,fbth792,t1_fbsf1kv,1577078762.0,"It has been horrible, especially in dealing with my own issues. I was improperly diagnosed and not medicated for most of my life. Until my diagnosis ten years ago, I have been steadily in therapy and on meds,  She once said to me that she was angry because I kept trying with my ex, her dad. He was in and out of rehabs and I of course came from having no father and my greatest fear was my girls not having a dad. So I went to Nar Anon meetings, Co dependency groups, women’s group therapy, marriage counseling. I did anything to keep him sober and keep us as a family. Even when he came out of jail into a halfway house, I waited til he had been clean a year before letting him come back home, and again he eventually went back to drugs. My daughter said she was angry at me for trying so hard. I apologized (my therapist says I should not apologize because that was not her business) saying I’m sorry that it affected you but I was only trying to keep our family together. Then she remarked how her dads NEW wife left him PROMPTLY after he got high, and never went back, immediately filing for divorce. She said that the new wife was a “very good mother for putting her kid first”.  While that’s fine for her, bravo, it wasn’t my choice I wanted him to be my husband and him to be the kids dad. She didn’t want to hear me. It’s been like this always. I can’t do anything right by her. I threw her a huge baby shower for 50 people and spent months planning it. I  bought her furniture for the baby’s room a rocking chair to nurse and my husband painted the baby’s room for her. I spent thousands on clothes and things from pottery barn. But I have realized nothing I could ever do will satisfy her. I don’t know why she is like this, but as a BPD sufferer, it is so very devastating to me."
BPD,fbtfv9y,t3_ee8ups,1577077449.0,"A dog. What is it? Just another animal? No, we who have loved a dog, know better. But what does the dog want? All a dog could ever want is a family, or a person of its own. To be needed and loved, and fed and walked, and to have a home. You fulfilled everything on his wish list for all of his life. That’s pretty incredible. He never spent a day in a shelter, or homeless, or hungry. He was happy. He even had the honor of sitting beside your mother when she suffered, he did what he knew he was there for. He was incredible, and the life he led was incredible. Imagine being wanted, loved, needed, cared for, respected, and encouraged to be the best you could be, all of your life. You gave that to him. A dogs life is short, but so very full. You were so very lucky to have him in your life, and you will always remember that. It is shocking to lose him so quickly and without warning, but his life had a very deep and resounding meaning. And not all of us are so lucky, as your dog was. I am sending love to your heart and soul, which are richer for having had him in your life. Xoxox"
BorderlinePDisorder,fbtedg3,t3_eed5g3,1577076074.0,"I don’t know your age. I am 52. This has been happening to me for many many years, especially in times of deep depression or anxiety. The dreams were terrifying, creatures and animals chasing me and biting my flesh, and other horrible things like that. After many years of ebb and flow with the night terrors, I realized that one of the things was my hormones were exacerbating the situation. Once I passed menopause completely, they stopped. I haven’t had one in over two years. Now idk if this is scientific or not, but I do know that hormones have a lot to do with our moods and reactions. Just food for thought. You could start to track your cycles and the nightmares and see if there are any coincidences."
