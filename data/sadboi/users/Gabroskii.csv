depression,evze7r5,t3_clue8y,1564955409.0,Im on the same boat. I've been doing a lot of work on my mental health lately by the doing the standard things people tell me to do (therapy/speak-up). There is always that one thought though that makes me feel like one day its just going to happen. I want to live and I want to grow and improve my self and well-being but it's hard to believe that I will die any other way other than suicide. It's a tough mindset as it feels like I'm my own angel and devil simultaneously.

TrueOffMyChest,ev4qm66,t1_ev4617p,1564219390.0,"I agree, I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for a very long time and I think I finally caught a break to be able to breathe and think about my life for a second and the choices im making. Im currently out of the US and I come back in 2 weeks so doing this freed up a lot of unnecesary stress and problems that could've risen once I'd be back."
TrueOffMyChest,ev4qeq5,t1_ev3v2q5,1564219264.0,When I finally let go it felt more like relief than anxiousness. I know now I don't have to worry about hearing from them or seeing them any longer. Ofcourse it sucks because they ARE your 'friends' but you need to care about yourself and that includes who you sorround yourself with. All of our situations are different ofcourse but I wish you the best of luck.

depression,eugdeio,t3_anh7tv,1563805596.0,"Im really scared what my future is going to be. I'm 1,000 miles away from home where theres someone I wish I could just hold and be with, sadly I don't know if I ever will get to do that again. It pains me so hard to believe my life is what it is today. I made a mistake and it spiralled me down to an endless world of anxiety. I don't have many friends and the ones I see the most are the least helpful. I know they care but they don't understand what struggling with mental health is so I can't even bring it up to them. My parents aren't 'believers' in depression or understand on why someone would take their own life. What hurts the most is the fact that I can't do anything from here to help my situation as I want to place myself in a better path for my future yet all I'm capable of doing right now is work on my mental health. I have limited resources and some days get very bad. I just recently started writing things down in an attempt to feel better which does sometimes. I also listen to audiobooks on mental health and things I can work on for the next two weeks before I return. I have my next semester coming up soon and I'm very scared as I dropped my last semester's classes due to having a drug and drinking problem. I tried to use substances to burry myself into the ground almost everynight in an attempt to either kill myself or numb myself forever. Im very scared what these next months are going to bring as I just want to get better and feel better for once. I've been suffering from depression for years and every year its gotten a lot worse. I have lost control a couple times now in an attempt to actually killing myself and I'm afraid it will happen again soon. Im trying my hardest, I just hope I get out of this one day."
