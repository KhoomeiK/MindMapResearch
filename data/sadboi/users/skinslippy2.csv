CPTSD,fah51u0,t3_e910fg,1576079321.0,"35 yr old son of a (now deceased) ex-cop/ex-marine who loved to look for conflict. As a kid, it made me nauseous and feel terrible for the person he would “dress down.”

As a teen, I’d still avoid conflict but learned how to de-escalate through humor. 

Then I grew up and started playing in biker and redneck bars and Dad’s “bullshit big headedness” helped me out a couple times, along with humor. 

Until I met who is now my wife of 13 yrs and have an almost 18 yr old step daughter and 9 yr old son. 

Now i act like my dad..... i smell an issue i want to stomp it out before those embers become a huge flame, but my (default) way isn’t right, and can do more harm than good. (PTSD amiright?). Through patience (my family’s), trial and error (all me) i’m correcting myself. 

You keep standing your ground. Draw your line- hold it- and it will get easier. Some people hate conflict, or are scarred by it. It’s something I’ve learned you have to expose yourself to it in order to deal with it.

You spoke up for yourself! Fuckin A! Good Job! Keep up the good work, the nerves and other feelings afterwards will ease the more you do these things! The situation can, and usually DOES, suck, BUT you can look at yourself and go, “I said my piece!  We’ll see what tomorrow brings because i did my best today.”"

As a kid- Fawn/Flight: I’m 35 and just realized how emotionally and psychologically abusive my dad was. My mom is/was a good manipulator. Both were bi-polar (“looking back as an adult and I’m now formally diagnosed because of a recent unintended “stay”) and my 23 year old brother (at the time) shot himself when I was 16 and I had to be the “rock” for mom and dad’s crumbling marriage.

Anyway the other pics of that scene was where he took a picture of the base of the neck where the head was decapitated, and his not says, “Jesus in the vertebrae” or something, because you look and you eye “matrixes” our an image of a bearded man with long hair- as a part of the deceased’s spine. 

Also two kids (teenage boyfriend and girlfriend) found an old dynamite storage building. Broke in stole a stick and didn’t realize it wasn’t stable AFTER it went off between them. There were pics but, you learn how fragile we are.

I did read the Great Woman Chief’s name and si-oh literally translates to “Hello”. I know it’s not spelled the same but when I read it in my head, I heard “God Hello”. Which in the tongue (I’m not fluent but I try to keep up- my cousin keeps me limbered up on our Cherokee- my dad grew up speaking cherokee and had to learn English in school-) you say what you are talking about first, then the verb and rest of the sentence.

  Then, he tries to gas light you, and pull all the tricks like he’s on the yard, and you set back and think, “Do you really think you’re that ‘many moves’ ahead of me.” I brush it off but, I also don’t keep my back to him.

to do.”  As if services is all they need, when really it’s the parents’ choices making it harder on these children... 

  I live in Oklahoma btw, so mental health and public schools are on the bottom of the priority list. To me sex is an animalistic/primal urge/need. If that urge or need can be removed, why not seal the door so it can’t be opened again?

  My personal opinion is to remove that urge in whatever way necessary.  If someone were to do that to my daughter or son it would be life changing for me, as a dad, because I would want justice and the guys wearing badges better find who did it first. Cuz daddy would go hunting lol. 
  
 Again, my own opinion, but it’s nice to see another Redditor who acknowledges both sides of an issue. Hope you have a great day, and feel free to hit me back if you disagree or talk further about it!"

I’m no expert, but from what I read he was one of the few who tried to use what media there was at the time to get his side of the story out. Only problem was...most reporters/journalists were all white and didn’t care. The ones who did care were not listened to because of bias. But, Geronimo did make some strides at de-escalation when things were winding down and his band’s numbers were dwindling. One of the few War Chiefs to be both fierce and grow old. 

I just know what I’ve read from Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (the book), and whatever tid-bits I find historically interesting. Feel free to not listen and to criticize me. I know what Reddit is..."
