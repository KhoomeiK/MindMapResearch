degoogle,fr2yxbe,t1_fr2xraa,1589846592.0,"Yes exactly my point. GrapheneOS is not Android. It’s android based. When I said pick one, I said android or degoogle. Not graphene or degoogle. OSX is built off freebsd but we consider them different operating systems, just like GrapheneOS  and Android are even though one is built off the other. Take it from GraphenOS official site: “GrapheneOS is an open source privacy and security focused mobile OS with Android app compatibility.” Notice how it even differentiates itself from the OS claiming it to be “Android app” compatible rather than saying a privacy oriented version of Android"

TheOfficialPodcast,fqoiede,t1_fqod2vk,1589515938.0,"There is no drama nor a weird accusation, this is how most companies work. If something if free, you are the product. Honeys coupon system works by you agreeing to give them your data. Same with most services like Facebook and a google account for example. While honey says they agree not to sell it (which I truly do believe) at the end of the day your data is being collected and stored and processed in a database somewhere that you do not own. Regardless of how much you trust honey, when you are installing the honey extension you are trading your internet browsing history to save maybe a couple bucks. Sounds like a horrible trade right?
And it goes further. Your also trusting honey to not get hacked. You are also trusting honey to even know that they got hacked if the did get hacked. You’re also trusting them to take the encryption of your data seriously. Also keep in  mind even if a company agrees not to sell your data that doesn’t mean they cant process and learn from it and sell that information.
To sum it up I do not believe that honey has any malicious intent. However I do not believe giving a company access to your online activity is a fair/reasonable/smart trade to save a negligible amount of money.


Back to kaya and the boys tho he’s so vocal about privacy and such issues and will dickride a vpn for its privacy features but meanwhile praise honey. No hate tho I love the guys just an observation"
