CPTSD,fmnvbx1,t3_fwazn7,1586236339.0,"This post and all of the comments here have been incredibly helpful and enlightening to me.

I always thought that what happened to me during my childhood doesn't count because it was mostly emotional. However, I can say that what happened in my childhood led to some severely messed up stuff happening in my adult life - stuff I would never have put up with if I didn't believe I deserved it because I am somehow ""less of a person than anyone else in the world"" (something that my mom drilled into my head at an early age). But by mentally putting myself in a position that is less important than everyone else, I've put myself in some really bad positions in life.

Since I am poor and have no access to mental health help, I try to cope by coming to Reddit occasionally, and also by writing horror stories. Because I believe that there is room in the horror genre to figuratively explore topics like this in a way that (hopefully) can help other people, too. I'm haunted, but not by any ghost. I don't have to be haunted by a ghost to suffer the kind of anxiety and panic attacks I go through frequently, but writing about a ghost or a haunted house or something like that can be sort of a therapeutic way for me to explore my own feelings about stuff like this. So that's what I do. I'm sure it's not for everyone, though."

My roommate (who also suffered significant abuse during childhood) has often suggested to me that the physical pains I have are connected to my anxieties, which stem from my experiences during childhood, but for whatever reason, I've always found it hard to believe that. However, as time goes on, and as I develop more and more weird physical issues that have no apparent physical source, I just start to wonder more and more about this stuff. It sounds like this book addresses that kind of stuff, and I am interested.

An example follows, but it contains triggers, for those who are sensitive to certain topics.

So... TRIGGER WARNING AHOY:

When I was under the age of ten, my mom woke me up during the unholy hours of the early morning one night and unloaded a bunch of her molestation experiences onto me whilst crying on my shoulder.

I held her and tried to comfort her, and then she yelled at me for not being supportive enough. At that age, I didn't know anything about anything sex-related. I thought I was a bad child for not being able to handle the situation better than I did.

Later on in life, after I had a certain ""bad experience"" of my own, she chose to mock me for it and tell me that I deserved it, instead of trying to be there for me like I tried to be there for her back then.

It was only much much later on in life that I realized that healthy mother daughter relationships are not like the one I experienced. Until then, I thought that my mom was great and that I must be the problem. (That ""realization"" was a slow process. It took years for me to actually ""realize"" that things at home were dysfunctional.)"

I saw the movie and didn't feel scared at all. I was mostly angry at the main characters and I personally sided with the Alice Krige (ghost) character.

I tried reading the book, but was extremely put-off by something that happened in the first chapter or so.

Is this a book that is just not scary if you feel that the ghost (or shape-shifter) deserves to have revenge?"

I mean, I've even found it to be difficult/impossible to even make or keep friends interested because of this kind of thing. But that's probably partly because I've learned not to talk about this kind of thing to people I don't know well enough - because otherwise they might make fun of me...

SPOILERS AHEAD:

Didn't the ghost kill himself in order to go after his step-daughter, who he abused?

And wasn't it explained that the reasoning for this was because he didn't want her to ""tell"" anyone, because he wanted to avoid going to jail?

Why was killing himself to haunt someone better than going to jail? Didn't the ghost defeat his own ends by making himself a ghost?

As someone who has been quite suicidal (most of my life), it's a scary thing to ponder. And pondering it for as long as I have (and I still consider suicide on an almost daily basis), I'm pretty sure that I would regret it in my last moments, no matter how sure I felt that I didn't want to be here.

Here in America, it's hard not to see failings as personal problems - not societal problems. After all, this is the country where (supposedly) you can go from rags to riches... right? At least, that's the mythology of America. I'm not so sure it's as true as it used to be, if it ever was true to begin with. In America, the story is that if you've failed, it's your own fault. And maybe it is my fault. But it is hard to look at those around me who feel the same way and not go.. ""Hang on, do we have a problem here? Like, as a society?"" Because there are a lot of people talking about suicide (and, unfortunately, committing it). And some of the people I've known who are now gone because of that - they are the last people in the world I expected to take their own lives.

And on top of feeling hopeless and pathetic as a human being, it's hard for me to ever be sure of my own objectivity, because given my usual mindset, I tend to see the darker side of things overshadowing the positive.

SuicideWatch,falsdn5,t3_e9eihw,1576189649.0,"I know what you mean (I grew up in a Christian homeschooling support system as a non-Christian and have been preached at a lot), but I guess I tend to see it as people with a completely different belief set than I have who are trying to help. So I do appreciate that - that they are trying to help. At least, I hope they are trying to help. But to me, it doesn't mean anything because it's not what I believe in, so it doesn't help other than to know that someone out there is trying to help.

SuicideWatch,f4rjp33,t1_f4rek1e,1571768378.0,"Yeah, I agree. I haven't found a single therapist who has helped me one bit. And every therapist I looked into who came highly recommended turned out to have left the practice because the work was too hard for them to handle. I can understand that, but it doesn't make me feel like getting help is feasible.

And I mean, if even the GOOD therapists can't handle it after a certain number of years, it doesn't make me feel better about sharing my traumatic stuff with others. Like, it's hard enough for me to share my traumatic stuff, but if it's also hard for the therapists to hear about it, it's like, well damn...

People still tell me to get help, and I would if I could, but I can't right now because I'm not well enough to get help on my own. It sucks. It really does. :/"
SuicideWatch,f4rjemg,t3_dlior3,1571768271.0,"I can so relate to this.

First of all, there is a lot of ranting ahead and I'm sorry about that, but the most important part of all of this is my roommate (I'll explain why later).

Everyone tells me to ""get professional help,"" but I can't afford it. And the free help is a joke.

To get the free help, I had to go to a center and wait all day for 3 days in a row, not knowing if they would be able to process me that day, or if I would have to come back. Meanwhile, spending every day around people who are arguably more ""troubled"" than I am is too much for me to handle. The only reason I got some help a couple years ago is because my roommate made a fuss because he saw that I was falling apart and that I wouldn't be able to come back for another day of that. 

After a few months, I was dropped from that therapy for ""not making enough progress."" So, they gave up on me? Great. That felt worse than no help at all.

On top of all that, I had an appointment for a social worker to come to my place - she stood me up.

I also had an appointment to see someone about medication. Had to wait 6 months for that appointment, and when the time came, my roommate and I both called to confirm and to make arrangements (because he had to take time off work to help me get there). Then they cancelled my appointment the day of, saying that we never called to confirm the appointment. WE DID, but it's our word against theirs, and there was nothing I could do except reschedule for another 6 months into the future. Spoiler: I never did reschedule. I just decided to forget the whole thing. It was causing me too much distress to watch myself fall further through the cracks in the system.

It's like, the system of free help is so hard to navigate, you're right. I'm right where you are at. I need help navigating the help system. And at this point, believing that I can find a therapist who can help me feels the same as believing that I'll ride a dragon/unicorn one day - I can't see how it's ever going to happen in this reality.

Also, the only reason that I'm in debt and my credit is ruined is because I called a suicide hotline and they took me in. Then, like an idiot, I tried to pay off my bill and when I couldn't, it was sold off to debt collectors, who hound me to this day. 

Like, okay, getting help made everything worse. Where can I go now? My own mom won't even help me or acknowledge my existence. Literally no one in the world can or will help me, ***except for my roommate***. And if it wasn't for him, I don't think I'd even be here now.

Now about my roommate - he has also been suicidal in his life and he almost didn't make it through that time of his life, and this is why he has helped me out as much as he has. He gets it. He gets what it's like to feel depressed and suicidal. If he hadn't made it through that dark time in his life, I'm pretty sure I would have been gone a long time ago. 

So, my main reason for staying around is: if him staying around saved my life, then it's possible that if I stay around, I could help others out who find themselves in a position like I'm in now. (I mean, I hope. I only hope that I will be in a position to help others one day. At this point in time, I can't even help myself, though.)

Anyways, sorry for ranting. I hope that helps in some way. Sometimes, I feel better just knowing that there are others who get me, and I just want to say that I totally get what you are saying here, especially when you say that ""help comes at cost that only sane people can afford."" I have had that same thought run through my mind, as well."

SuicideWatch,f43nibe,t3_djabxv,1571343406.0,"I know what you mean. This place is often my only source of help and support and everyone here in this subreddit gives me reason to keep going. There are so many people like me who are here and struggling, and I want to help everyone here because I know how hard it is to just keep existing sometimes.

I don't know you, but I don't want you to die. I want you (and everyone else here) to stick around! And I know it's hard to do that sometimes, especially when it feels like no one ""gets"" it.

Personally, I'm here because I also feel suicidal today. I opened up to people about how I feel and had them tell me that I need professional help. It's like... yeah, I know I need professional help, but I don't have access to it. All these people who tell me to go see a professional - they don't understand that that is not an option in my current situation. I know they are just trying to help, but it sucks when people talk to me as though I have the freedom and ability to do these kinds of things. I need help in getting help. But I have no one who will or who can help me. And when people don't ""get"" that and just say ""get help"" and then they walk away, it makes me feel so much worse. I feel written off by the world.

One of things that causes me pain lately is; I see other people have moms who ""come to the rescue"" when life gets tough. I don't have a mom like that. My mom is an abusive, narcissistic alcoholic bitch. But in public, she presents herself as the perfect mother - like Stepford Wives, except she is the one doing the controlling. She doesn't give a crap about me. But a lot of people don't understand this, and that hurts for me because it hurts that so many other people have had loving mothers, yet I don't have that. But other people who know me THINK that I have a mom I can go to. My mom is there for everyone but her own kids, so it makes sense that other people wouldn't know that she treats her own kids like crap. 

My neighbor has been going through hard times, and her mom comes over to help her out every day. It makes me feel so sad and so jealous. Why can't my mom be like that? Why can't she be there for me? Why is she there for everyone EXCEPT her own kids? The answer is that she feels she has rotten kids. It fills me with despair, hopelessness, and self-loathing that my own mother doesn't have enough time for me in her life because she is too self-absorbed to care about anything more than herself. And since us kids are failures in her eyes, she doesn't like us because we aren't giving her anything to brag about to her friends. On top of that, she will demean me if I *am* lucky enough to be able to have a conversation with her when I'm having a hard time. So, not only does she not help me out in any way, she also puts me down. I don't worry that I'll make my mom sad if I commit suicide - I know that me committing suicide would make her day. She would be rid of me, and it would give her something to get her lots of attention from other people, which is the thing she loves most in life. Knowing that my mom would be elated if I committed suicide kind of keeps me around. Because I don't want to give her that satisfaction.

Since I don't have a mom to talk to about stuff like this, I often come here. I get more help from this subreddit than I get anywhere else in my life. I don't know what I would do without all of you guys because you all ""get"" just how tough this stuff can be.

Everyone please stick around!"

unpopularopinion,f2x4vme,t3_deig8l,1570473796.0,"First of all, I'm actually a female and I can definitely understand this.

I have a lot of resentment towards my mom (and grandma). But there were a few instances of really supportive women in my life, as well. Unfortunately, my mom was/is so good at lying and presenting a false reality that no one knew what really went on at home, and she drove away many of the supportive women in my life or turned them into her friends instead of mine (so, it would never be safe to confide in these people without whatever I said to them getting back to her). Even I didn't understand that what went on at home was wrong and dysfunctional - at least, not until late into my 20s.

My brother was treated worse by her, but he is far from being anything close to a misogynist. He is one of the kindest people I know.

I still have a lot of anger and resentment towards my mom, but it will never be resolved. Communication with her is impossible unless it's totally on her terms. And according to her, nothing is wrong with our relationship. It's like living a lie. I know the truth of things, but on the surface, things have to look all happy and totally normal. But it's never been normal or happy. It's just been messed up. She has said and done so many hurtful things, things she often claims to not even remember, or accuses me of making them up.

Everything has to revolve around her. She is alcoholic, verbally and emotionally abusive, often absent, and refuses to address or even acknowledge any of her issues. Even after getting a DUI, it isn't her who made a mistake by getting behind the wheel drunk - in her opinion, it's the system that's totally corrupt. (Before the DUI, she was fine with the system and against drunk driving.)

Probably the hardest part is, despite all the crap that's gone on, I believe she actually loves me in her own way - that she is just incapable of showing it in a normal and healthy way.

But all of this crap is hidden - everyone else perceives that she is this wonderful person, who I am so lucky to have for a mother. And I just have to be like ""Yeah, I'm so lucky. I have a great mom.""

Now that I'm older, I do think that there are a few people in her life who can tell that ""something"" is up, but they don't know exactly what that ""something"" is. Some people in her life keep her at arms length, I've noticed. And you have to, because she invades boundaries like crazy. I'm still trying to build my own personal boundaries and learn to defend them. I grew up feeling that I didn't have the right to defend my own boundaries because I wasn't allowed to. That one issue alone has harmed me so much in my adult life. Though, it's only one of many issues I have because of my dysfunctional upbringing.

&#x200B;

I'm so afraid of my mom, and so angry at her, and at the same time, in a messed up way I also love her because she is my mom and I want her to be my mom. I want her to be there for me like I've seen other moms be there for their kids, unconditionally loving them and supporting them. As opposed to telling me that I need/deserve to suffer because I've had it too good for too long. According to her, I've had it ""too good"" since I was a toddler, and I suppose in her eyes, I'm supposed to forever work off that debt of growing up more well off than she did. What she doesn't realize is that, though my material needs might have been taken care of, I lived in an environment of pure fear and walking on eggshells all the time in my own home. Since I was partially home-schooled and extremely socially isolated, her influence was the primary influence I had while growing up. And this has dramatically impacted my life in so many negative ways.

&#x200B;

I know this post is long, but it's so hard to describe this stuff... and there is so much still left unsaid. And whenever I talk about this stuff, I feel like I'm just whining. Like, so I didn't have a perfect loving mother - so what? Why can't I just get over that fact already and move on with my life? But it's so much more involved than that - it's the way she made me feel about myself and the way she made me feel about the world. My psyche has been negatively imprinted and I spend so much of my time and energy fighting the bad thoughts and negativity that she has bestowed on me. I'm pretty sure she didn't mean to do harm, but it doesn't fix the pain and the damage done. I sometimes wonder if I'll ever really be okay."

My mom is the master of minimizing feelings of others and being raised by her was incredibly damaging to us kids.

Something she said several times about my brother being suicidal: ""I wish he would just go ahead and do it and put us all out of his misery already."" What kind of mother says that about her own child? Seriously...

She hasn't been very supportive of me, either, needless to say.

But I know that if either of us ever does end up ending our own life, she would be eagerly soaking up all the attention that it gets her from people around her.

When I complain about her, people are like ""what a bad person for talking poop about their own mom,"" yet no one sees or hears the way she treats us in private.

I was 17 when I was hospitalized for trying to OD. At the hospital, the doctor asked me why I did it and before I could answer, my mom started to answer the question for me.
