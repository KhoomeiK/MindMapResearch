Of course this must have upset my mom but I was young and didn’t fully understand and I never talked to her about how it made her feel or asked her about it. Fast forward 15 years and my mom now does that same shit. Getting these messages from my mom KILLS ME and she HAD to have felt the same way when it was happening to her right?? So why does she do it??? Me and my 2 siblings are more than 100% sure none of us will EVER be like her. It crosses my mind at least once a day to never be like her.
