Assistance,etckozv,t1_etck3jv,1562686947.0,WOW! That's the last time I come here for help. As someone struggling with depression and borderline suicidal do you honestly think talking to me this way is helpful? What is the point of asking for help and support when you get this as a response????

MentalHealthAndMe,etc8zxa,t1_etc7nwx,1562678845.0,Thank you for your response. I'm sorry you are also going through something similar. I do feel it would be alot easier if I had the support I needed but I guess the only person that can help me is myself..
MentalHealthAndMe,et9dupc,t1_et9d7df,1562594344.0,"Thank you for your response. However, I don't live with my parents I'm 40 years old. My family don't even live in the same country as me. I have already been to see a doctor and sought help. That's not the issue. The issue is my family not being supportive."
