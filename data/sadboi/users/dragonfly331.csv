selfharm,fnlux9r,t3_g2df6o,1587060158.0,"This reminded me of something that happened with my friend, when her dad saw her cuts he straight up told her to stop doing that at that they’re ugly. When my friend told me this I was disgusted. I am sorry your dad said that to you it was very insensitive."

selfharm,fn8epi9,t1_fn7v0gp,1586739969.0,That makes sense and feel very similar
selfharm,fn8efb7,t1_fn7fcvu,1586739792.0,I’m the same way and I feel like if I don’t have any scars then it’s almost like I am faking the way I feel or that the way I feel is stupid.
selfharm,fn4t1ac,t3_fzalqz,1586648336.0,This is exactly how I feel and you explained it so well so thank you
selfharm,fmyb3fy,t1_fmy78ag,1586482067.0,but cutting is a form of self harm

selfharm,fmvjqlo,t3_fxjtvs,1586419467.0,"This is me most of the time when I cut and I don't know why either. I don't really understand it but it is probably just become a habit for me, maybe it is the same for you?"

selfharm,fmfgk7c,t3_fuycsp,1586026788.0,This is exactly how I feel and I don’t really understand why. But I can never cut that deep and I think part of the problem is that my knife isn’t that sharp but it’s really frustrating. It almost feels like I am even a failure at cutting.

selfharm,fjt2zsu,t1_fjt2mb4,1583603158.0,Well if you decide you want to get help and give it another chance hopefully things will work out. But I do understand somewhat how you feel because I honestly don’t know if I want help but I think that’s simply just because I am too scared.
selfharm,fjt2kb9,t1_fjszhwg,1583602883.0,"Thank you for this, I will definitely consider it and I hope everything goes okay for you when you ask for help."

selfharm,fjsu9rf,t1_fjs0ojg,1583600528.0,I was honestly thinking it would be better if she found out herself but you’re probably right. I still am not quite sure how to tell her but thank you for this.

donorconceived,fibalz9,t1_fiba15m,1582317981.0,Yeah my donor said he knows for sure about 75 but this was back in 2011 and he suspects there to be around 140-160 kids

selfharm,fhrfsun,t1_fhqky13,1581825111.0,"This has also been happening to me too, I have been cutting everyday for the past two weeks and I wish I would just stop but I can’t."
selfharm,fhk7fyc,t3_f3jogr,1581670424.0,I do this all the time and I still don’t really understand why because I don’t want scars because I don’t want anyone to see them but at the same time I do kind of want scars. This makes no sense and I am just very confused with myself because I cut again tonight for absolutely no reason.
AskReddit,fhibzmj,t1_fhhdqgo,1581621792.0,"This is the exact same for me but it can be really hard sometimes because so many people think I am really boring and it causes me to start to think maybe I am really boring. I don’t have many close friends but when I am with them, I am very loud and talk a lot. My friend always tells me that I should act the way I do with her and show that side of me at school. But she doesn’t really get it, it’s really hard for me and it doesn’t help that I have social anxiety."
depression,fhfa6xk,t3_f2qwaw,1581539325.0,"I relate to this so much, especially the memory part. When I was younger I used to have an excellent memory but up until recently I can’t remember anything for the life of me and it’s really frustrating."
donorconceived,ffrekr2,t3_esv4vr,1580156495.0,I went/am going through a similar situation. I recently found my donor on the donor sibling registry and figured out he ended up doing a documentary about his experience. The video no longer exists but there are tons of websites that talk about it and it was so weird. I had always wondered what he looked like and then there he was. But the most shocking thing for me was how many half siblings I have. I had no idea I had that many it was insane.
donorconceived,ffrdjxc,t3_eticpr,1580155874.0,Congratulations! I recently met my brother and sister and I had an amazing time. I hope everything went well.
donorconceived,fb5hl2p,t1_fb5h8m4,1576527746.0,That’s smart but also unless I have more then 2 half siblings (which I don’t think I do) I know who they are and I’m actually planning on meeting them soon!
donorconceived,fb5h0wm,t1_fb5gosg,1576527466.0,I’m pretty sure he only donated at one clinic and I don’t  know if they had or have a limit of how much you can donate. But I think it’s really important that they do because there’s a chance I could date one of my half siblings with out knowing we’re related. So hopefully that doesn’t happen.
donorconceived,fb5gh0f,t1_fb5g1ss,1576527178.0,Yeah it’s pretty rare to have that many and honestly I don’t really understand how my sperm donor was able to donate so much. But what was cool/really fucking weird is that I found the donor because he was on a reality show talking about this and I was shocked.
donorconceived,fb5fwjs,t1_fb5fh3b,1576526873.0,"I ended up finding out on a website called donor sibling registry that I have at least 65 half siblings which is insane to me and it took me forever to process that. But now I think it’s pretty cool, still trying to process but I also found out I have 2 full siblings because my mom donated her extra embryos."
donorconceived,fb5535w,t1_fb54n70,1576521136.0,I recently got my results and found out that I have several half siblings and I find it to be really cool!

Anxiety,f8ai7pf,t1_f89ib70,1574398054.0,"That's interesting, I have never heard of that but thank you for this I will definitely try this next time."
donorconceived,f8ai2co,t1_f5ir46i,1574397928.0,"yeah, I am going to do an ancestry DNA test and if you're worried about them not being aware that they have any half siblings I would suggest doing ancestry DNA because I am pretty sure it would just go under a section called close family."
donorconceived,f8ahqfm,t1_f81giz3,1574397647.0,Well I don't know what it's like to be adopted but I would assume it is pretty similar

Anxiety,f2bla5w,t3_dcs97z,1570127924.0,This happens to me whenever I’m super anxious I hate it because I’m trying to continue my day but it makes it so difficult.
Anxiety,f2bd529,t3_dctwc1,1570124883.0,Something kind of similar used to happen to me except it wasn’t real and it didn’t happen that much out in public but specifically in the bathroom. I knew no one was there but still I was constantly paranoid that someone was watching me and it got to the point where I would be brushing my teeth and be pretty much spinning in circles the entire time to make sure no one was around me. But this started to get better one I went on medication.
depression,f28zq01,t3_dcknzd,1570075389.0,"I know it seems this way now and no matter how cheesy this is, it will get better so please don't give up hope. I am sure there is at least one person who loves and cares about you. So just remember it will get better and life will be worth living for."
depression,f1ni8af,t3_d9zbj7,1569617888.0,I resonate with this so much and I don't even know what to do anymore I have felt like this for years now. One year I thought I was getting better but really I had just become completely numb to life and I have been like this ever since.
