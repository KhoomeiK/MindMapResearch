For local government, its probably similar. I know that Buncombe relies heavily on sales taxes for part of its operations.

Cities and towns are generally determined by population (cities are larger, typically around 50k population or more), and even though they will have a legally defined border, often the people living there will have their own understandings of where the city outskirts are - for example, a city with sprawling suburbs, where the outer suburbs are not within city limits, but are still considered a part of the city.  

Heres an example:   

In my state, there is no legal distinction between cities and towns. A town of 1,000 people is incorporated in the same way as a city of 1,000,000 people. The only difference is the name.  

I live in Town A, which is about 15 minutes outside of City B, where I work. Both Town A and City B are contained within County C.   

My home falls under the legal jurisdiction of County C and Town A, while my workplace falls under County C and City B.

In English, most of the time, that structure is the natural flow of the sentence, but occasionally, like in your first example, it flows more naturally to move the preposition to the end of the sentence.  

All three of your examples are technically correct, but the first example will the the most common, and the other two will only show up in the most formal types of writing.

bipolar,fo3cm4p,t3_g5au8w,1587484595.0,"YES. I feel like been hovering around this in-between spot for a while now, and its weirdly disconcerting. I dont have the boundless energy and euphoria of mania, but I also dont have the soul-sucking drudgery of depression.   

When I tried to explain to my (non-bipolar) wife that I wasn't feeling either of those, she reacted, as any reasonable person would, by saying ""oh, that's great! That's good news right?""   

And I really honestly didnt know the answer. Yes? I mean, not making rash decisions because I'm impervious to consequence is a good thing. Not being confined to the couch or bed for a week straight because I just dont have the energy to do any more than lay down is also a good thing.  

But also, No? I don't know who this in-between person is. He's got, like, responsibilities and a capacity to follow through on them. He has more measured emotional responses to things. He gets tired at the end of the day, and can actually sleep for 6-8 hours (not the 2-4 of mania or the 9-10 of depression). I feel like I'm doing a terrible job at being this person. I feel like this person should really have their shit together a little more.   

My anxiety has been through the roof -- even before the neverending staycation -- and I think it's because I feel... normal? and I don't know what normal is supposed to mean. How do I just go through my day-to-day on a normal basis? How do I form habits and routines that stick? Any attempt at that before was thwarted whenever my mood shifted. I feel like I should be accomplishing things on a daily basis, but what? How much is reasonable? What do normal people do all day?   

Ugh.
