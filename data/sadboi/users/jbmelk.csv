1. Original communists found the things that exploited the workers the most are companies. A company had almost no opportunity for a non-profit revenue-sharing model because anybody that would be propped up at the top would inherently seek more power. That’s why communism in general is a failure, any person who comes into power of a communist state wants power, especially if they weren’t the ones who were the figureheads of their countries’ respective revolutions (take Xi Jingping, Stalin, Maduro, etc). People are inherently power-hungry and leadership of companies will inherently be greedy. 

2. Lenin proposed a « dictatorship of the proletariat as a prelude to communism ». In that time, McCarthyism wasn’t around and Communism was recognised as Marxism, which is different from Stalinism that McCarthyism groups all factions of Communism in under that type of policy. Lenin wanted a short transition period to rid the people of companies, then institute Marxism. 

3. Fascism is an economic theory, and it’s original creators had nothing to do with race. Nazism is actually a subsection of socialism (National Socialism), albeit quite far away from most types of socialism, where the struggle of the proletariat is replaced by the « struggle of the German race ». Economically, Nazi Germany was incredibly far away from most Fascist countries, but Italy and Japan saw a potential anti-Communist ally militarily. The Axis never had shared economic resources even close to the level of the US-UK-Canada alliance (I’m leaving the USSR out because they were more military and less economic aligned with us three)"

canada,fqm7bvb,t1_fqjd7v4,1589472733.0,"But the thing is, the PRC is state capitalism. Basic communist theory concludes the solution to capitalism and the exploitation of workers is the lack of companies. The PRC has countless companies where they exploit workers to the max, and allow American companies to either directly produce there (Nike) or outsource the labour (Apple). I’m not a communist in the slightest, but actual original communism is how Lenin proposed originally (which is just as shit). The PRC are fake communists who use government’s power over corporations to exploit workers even more than a communist or capitalist society would. 

Side note: I completely agree with everything else you said outside of the first paragraph. China doesn’t even deserve to have the acknowledgment of being communist, they’re a completely different monstrous type of system, just like how in the books Nazism is differentiated from Fascism because they were ideologically different. Both just as horrible, but still different systems."

For me, the town I live in is not dense in the slightest, however only around 30 minutes from a huge city.

I’m not too sure how complicated refugee status is to get from the US. Not to get political but objectively, the president had banned all immigration from many middle-eastern nations.

I can’t explain it without sounding like I’m madly in love with a woman, hell, in real life, I saw disturbing images on my fathers phone that made me almost physically unable to show physical affection. Ruined at least three relationships that way. Made me think I was gay or something along those lines for a while. But I felt happy for the first time in a long time. Not happy from getting something in the mail, not scoring a goal in NHL happy, but a different type of happy. It wasn’t a sensation like how people would describe it, but my soul, my heart, it was joyous. It was the best feeling in the world.
