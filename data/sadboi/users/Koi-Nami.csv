Did the doctor stop it or did they? Try to get them back on it since it seems like they were doing better. Gentle nudges help, but they might need to be in another ward for a little while just to be put on the meds again or to get more help. But speaking from experience, do your research about the mental hospitals your family member ever gets sent to. Some are pretty disgusting. I wouldn't cut them off.

yuumimains,fcxron3,t3_ejdf16,1578069533.0,"' About items I **always** go Athene's Unholy Grail as first items (after buying the support one of course) it gives you everything you need, it helps with mana, and it boost your heal. Again, your job is to keep your teamates alive, with the right items and E maxes you can heal anyone full HP with an E and enable incredible teamfights. Actually, before unholy grail I usually buy dark seal. Only if I see we are doing VERY poorly I don't buy dark seal, with Yuumi is easy to max your mejaa '

&#x200B;

That is bad advice. Why would you always go Athenes when Ardent is great for your team? If you have an adc? If many on your team would benefit from the attack speed? Like, no. Ardent and then Athenes is preferred for me and majority of people tbh. You're not going to have a mage bot lane all the time. And plus, she builds ap Yuumi. That is not recommended anymore.

I'm a 74% wr+ top10 Yuumi main and I usually build ardent first unless my botlaner will not benefit from the attack speed or I need a mana item first like Ludens. After Ardent, I'll go athenes and probably redemption, crucible, ghosts, or whatever fits. I like to build Ludens a lot for mana so i might do that second instead.
