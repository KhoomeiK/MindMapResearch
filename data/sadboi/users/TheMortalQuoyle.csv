Divorce,fc5miiy,t3_egbz2z,1577461502.0,This is one of the most insightful and poignant things I've read about amicable divorce. Thank you for putting it into words. I'll be sharing this with my stbx later today. Thank you.

Divorce,fbrszlz,t3_ee7xsv,1577046037.0,"We are in the middle of an amicable divorce and spending holidays with both families. Everyone knows what's going and have for a few months. Both families have been understanding and supportive.  It's rough knowing that STBX's family, who have been an integral part of my life, will soon play a much smaller role.   While I will likely have some contact with them in the future, this is my last Christmas with them. I will savor the day and mourn the loss afterward."

Divorce,f7715kw,t3_dujmwo,1573441109.0,"We had the talk on August with the plan to live together until we both secured housing. This has been an amicable and agreeable situation as we agree that we make better friends than a couple. It worked out that I'm staying in the house and buying out her equity. We both assumed that she would be staying in the house until spring when the housing market picks up again. As luck would have it, she found a house and will be moving out in December. It's actually a bit of a relief. Even though I was ok with her staying, I'm ready to start living my new life. She is ready too."

Relief is the only word to describe it. We're also cohabitating while we figure out our living arrangements. Our marriage is ending, but we saved our friendship. It's confusing for friends and family because there is no anger or animosity, and no sides to take."

Divorce,f0munb4,t1_f0mi1b2,1568753530.0,"There is hope as long as you're both willing to be be practical and pragmatic adults. For us, the awkward transition of becoming platonic happened over years, but didn't really come to a head until a year ago. That's when we started therapy and began actually taking about the issues. Once we had things in the open, we needed to figure out what we wanted. We talked about the options (continue and be miserable, domestic partnership with an open marriage, or divorce). This discussion went from what we could do to what we will do without deliberation. I think it took so long because neither of us wanted to be the one to suggest divorce. Once the decision was made, the weight was lifted and evening else had been easy. The only hard part was telling friends and family and explaining that there's no blame or animosity. Most people don't understand how that can be. The best answer is that we sacrificed our marriage to save our friendship."
Divorce,f0kllfn,t3_d596t1,1568682062.0,"I consider myself lucky. After 23 years of marriage (no kids), my wife and I have decided to divorce. However, we saved our friendship. It took a year of therapy and some hard conversations, but we made the right choice. Without the burden of maintaining the marriage we've become friends again. We're still in the process of getting divorced, but it's been very easy to divide the finances and possessions. The hard part was trying to wear the mask of a couple."
