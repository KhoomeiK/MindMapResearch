bipolar,ey5dpji,t3_cvd0yk,1566829065.0,"I am bipolar 1, and it has pretty much robbed me of everything. I have been married and divorced 3 times, had 2 daughters that now have nothing to do with me. Have lost all the friends I've ever had,  and my parents who are now dead were the only ones who ever stood by my side. I'm 61 years old now and in a nursing home for the mentally ill, and live with some really crazy people. The good news is my medicine is straight now and I'm no longer suicidal and I'm somewhat stable. I've lived a life of depression, drugs and alcohol abuse, and several attempts of taking my life. Up and down, constantly a battle in me mind. Trying to be happy is a daily struggle. Somehow I'm able to do it. I'm a pretty good guitar player, I write music and poetry, I'm an artist. Bipolar and creativity, who would think? For now I'll love my girlfriend, we have been together for over a year now, she's also bipolar and we get along well, and do the things I enjoy."
bipolar,eu9w8wa,t3_cf8hjb,1563592679.0,"My bipolar disorder has been horrible for the past 3 weeks or so, and I have really been struggling. All I can say this really sucks having this!! My medicine keeps getting adjusted, I sleep a lot, I'm super depressed all the time, and I have no desire to do anything. I've been set up to meet with a psychologist to talk to, but my mind is so confused I don't know how that's going to go. I've been feeling great for the past year or so, and this just came out of nowhere. I have no emotions, no feelings, no desire to do my hobbies, and cry for no reason. So I  guess that has to be an emotion. I just feel worthless, lifeless, and hopeless. How much more I can take I don't know, but this is not like me at all. I can't feel like this anymore, but I refuse to be overmedicated. I'm sick and tired."
bipolar,et0id7u,t3_c9jmne,1562379699.0,"Latuda is extremely overpriced if you ask me. I was on it for a long time and it worked fine. When my insurance changed to Medicare it was no longer covered, my psychiatrist switched me to 200mg of seroquel at bedtime for my bipolar disorder and I'm back to normal. It also helps me sleep. Latuda is ridiculously priced and out of reach for many insurance companies to cover. It's a shame, because it works so well."
bipolar,es7xmg0,t3_c6aa9m,1561682723.0,"I'm bipolar 1 and also in a very healthy relationship with a woman who is also bipolar. Our recovery is always first, and we are always there for one another. We have been together for over a year, and are getting married in September.  We live in a retirement home for people like us. We take our own medicine, are responsible to go to our groups and counciling. This relationship has helped us both grow in our disorder. Love is the best healing therapy! Don't let anyone tell you anything different. Compatibility and recovery is most important! We are very much in love, and show it to each other all the time. IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP!!"
relationship_advice,ero283w,t1_ero1wwf,1561066501.0,days like this before. Hope this helps . We are getting married in September and will continue recovery and counseling together and love each other as we have been doing.
relationship_advice,ero1wwf,t3_c317m9,1561066287.0,"I have mental illness, bipolar disorder 1, manic depression, and I am engaged to a woman with the same diagnosis along with schizophrenia. We have been together for a year and have learned to help each other with our issues and have been able to help one another through our episodes. Understand that mental illness is like a roller coaster ride. It has its ups and downs. Some days will be better than others. Most days we are able to function fairly normal and Express our thoughts and feelings to one another without problems. If this is an abrupt change you may need to speak with her therapist and get a professional involved. However it could be nothing as we have had"
relationship_advice,ernsub1,t3_c2zwu0,1561060284.0,"I also have a panic attack from time to time, and have been ignored by my ex girlfriend before. That is why she is my ex girlfriend. Supporting people are good to be around during those times as I do know how they are. Feeling like the world is coming to an end is not a comfortable experience. I've been through it alone before. I feel for you. Internet hugs!!!"
bipolar,erj3wnt,t3_c247c0,1560914959.0,"I'm bipolar 1, take zoloft, Topomax, atavan, and seroquel at night. My sex drive is through the roof!! I just have to do it before I take the seroquel though. I'm 61 years old and can still do it two to three times a day. My wife is 43 years old. I take no supplements."
relationship_advice,erdjxyd,t3_c1eh4x,1560744614.0,"I  found someone who truly cares and loves me after getting out of a toxic relationship. I was in a very toxic relationship for 5 years abused verbally,  financially and emotionally while battling a mental illness. A woman that promised to stand by me, let me down in all the worst possible ways and instead of loving me and getting me help put me away in a room alone feeling like life was no longer worth living to deal with my depression she was causing and suicide attempts. I was finally rescued by my brother who got me the help I needed. First I had to heal, then learn to love myself again. Prayed real hard, and the good Lord sent me a woman to first be my best friend. We fell in love, been going strong for a year now! Getting married in September!! I've learned to trust again, to love for real, receive love, and be a true friend, and partner. YES IT DOES HAPPEN!!!"
relationship_advice,erc7r0f,t3_c1b8f3,1560704976.0,"She could possibly have a serious mental illness. My girlfriend has bipolar disorder with schizophrenia, and argues with a certain woman in her head from time to time and has these episodes that I have to help her through. She takes a lot of medicine and goes to a lot of counseling, and I have been coached on how to handle her under these episodes. Drinking and drugs is a definite no no. That will only escalate the situation. Get her to a dr. Our relationship is fine, however we both work at it, and it takes love, understanding, and patience. Good luck!"
bipolar,eqjqcbi,t3_b9rax3,1560109536.0,"I have bipolar 1. The more severe form of the disorder. I also have acute schizophrenia, which causes me to hear voices telling me to hurt myself. However with proper medication, I do not hear these voices. I live in a nursing home where people like myself are treated for mental illness. I do know that bipolar disorder alone does not cause a person to hear voices. That is a delusion caused by schizophrenia, which is really your own voice you believe is someone else. I've been locked up in special hospitals for this, and have been through many hours of counseling to deal with this condition. I will be on medication for this the rest of my life, as there is no cure. I am now fully functional, and live without help, have a fiancee, getting married, and life is good.  If that helps. There is hope!! Get her help. I've gotten the help I've needed and to meet me you would think I was normal. I just have to keep my life in check. Hope this helps."
relationship_advice,eqjlsrh,t3_byf7dg,1560107236.0,I am also bi-polar and the drugs and alcohol definitely HAS TO STOP!!! Mixing that with the medication is the worst possible thing she could do for her self. She is just completely disabling herself from any chance of reality to take care of herself or her child. Do your part and get a professional involved before it's to late! This is a recipe for disaster!!!
relationship_advice,eqj6kos,t1_eqhg999,1560099788.0,"Thanks for your comment. When we do move we will be around people like us and will continue treatment for schizophrenia with meds, counseling, and groups as we are having now. We both understand the long road ahead of us and are prepared to tackle it together as we have been. Since we have been a couple, our mental illness has improved for both of us. It's like love has a special healing therapy. Thanks again!"
