However in the context of deaths from stroke or other acute events that were facilitated due to being ill with covid, I think that is murkier water and there can definitely be a case by case ruling made on many of those that death was brought on by a covid related complication. 

But that is the issue, a case by case decision cannot be made because there are too many cases to decide on and not enough resources allocated to meticulously analyze each death. Nor would there be an incentive to do this because resources are being directed to managing this situation.

I guess I'm using a lot of words to say that while you are right that ODs should not be attributed to covid, there are other cases of death that can be, and that is likely why Fauci and others say we are underreporting."
