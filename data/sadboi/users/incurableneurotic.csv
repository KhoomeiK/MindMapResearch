I'd cry myself to sleep and not understand why.  By my teens I was a sad, fucked up kid wanting to die.  No one talked about mental illness in the '80s unless you were making fun of a ""bag lady"" or ""hobo"".  I didn't know what depression was.  I just knew that I hurt, that no one else seemed to understand me, and that no one else seemed to suffer ""for no reason"" like I did.  

By 17 I gave up, bought pills and OD'd, hoping to die.  I woke up in  a hospital with tubes in my nose, and my stomach sore from being pumped.  FINALLY, I heard the term ""depression"".  FINALLY I got treatment (inpatient in a psych unit for four months, given meds and counseling).  

Once back out in the real world I realized my family was still clueless about it all.  No aunts or uncles or grandparents or cousins even acknowledged what I'd been through - to this day none of them have offered any support.  People I'd known in high school could give two shits about me.  I was getting psychiatric help, but ultimately I was totally alone.   

Over the years I sought out happiness like we all do.  Got a degree, a career, married, traveled.  Antidepressants glued me together and kept the deathwish at bay, for the most part.  But I still have bad days, and thank god there's Reddit now where I can vent and hear from other people who understand me.

depression,evn3l36,t1_evn3cf0,1564618140.0,"Right, I had no idea what depression even was.  And I honestly believed I was the only one in the world who felt what I was feeling, because no one else in my small world understood my pain.  It was excruciating."
depression,evn3a50,t1_evn28oa,1564617989.0,"My life is immensely better than it was decades ago.  But depression is depression.  It hurts.  I need to try a new med because I think my SSRI just isn't working for me anymore, but it's so scary to taper off and experiment with something different.  

I'm sorry to have discouraged you.  I just wanted to be real and put it out there.  It's a lifelong struggle for a lot of us.  You can end your life or you can keep living, it's a powerful choice and decision.  

Before meds I was ""only valleys"" as well.  Once I started on Norpramin, one of the original antidepressants, it was like everything suddenly made sense.  I had a disease, and this pill made it bearable.  That's how I knew that peaks actually existed.  Unfortunately, meds aren't a cure-all.  Some work, some don't, some peter out after a while.  I'm not giving up yet, I just haven't found the right treatment."
depression,evn2f8h,t1_evn17f4,1564617561.0,"I understand it all feeling pointless.  Depression makes it hard to pretend life is wonderful, and hard to block out all the shitty things in the world and in my head.  I don't know what keeps me going sometimes, other than promising my best friend that I would not hurt myself.  I could take control and end my life in a matter of minutes and yet I haven't done that.  I guess just knowing that I could is relief enough sometimes."
depression,evn1z7w,t1_evn1g4r,1564617336.0,"/r/depression is great.  When I was a teenager there was no Internet.  I don't know how I survived those years.  I couldn't talk to anyone about what I was going through, I had no understanding of what was wrong with me, it was just pure pain.  I only got help once I attempted suicide."
depression,evn0fh9,t1_evn05i0,1564616554.0,I'm glad you're on /r/depression.  You'll find a lot of people who can relate and you'll learn more about what you're experiencing that way.
depression,evn01gd,t1_evmxauf,1564616356.0,"That's what my SO tells me!  We went on a hike once and climbed so high that we were above the clouds.  We talked about how it was just like depression, and that not being able to see sunlight because of the clouds didn't mean there was no sun up there."
