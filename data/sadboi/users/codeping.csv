In your opinion should Dr's be so adamant about the cause of your psychosis? What I have heard dr's say about the cause makes me upset. I don't feel actually understood, when that is the whole purpose I see Dr's in the first place. 

Benzodiazepines have been useful for me because of the lack of Euphoria--While still being able to be social, without alcohol. But I don't feel Dr's take the time to understand my Benzo use..

One thing is take your anxiety seriously and self advocate well. It's a legit problem and you are an adult at this point with life experience behind you. I dont want to sound scary but you can reach a breaking point where you would need a benzo on hand and it makes me upset how scared docs are to give it even as a PRN.

Me tapering off klonopin so easily, i am getting more agoraphobic, but it also just makes me think the medication isnt nearly as dangerous as whats said. Personally I'm really against antipsychotics like Seroquel I'd rather take a benzodiazepine for sleep or anxiety, i view the antipsychotic as disabling and the benzodiazepine as enabling.. do I have a bad perception of drugs?

Nothing is that complicated about tapering and I actually dislike people emphasizing it so much, when SSRi's you also need to taper off of, if you cut off antipsychotics as well, you can get delusions as a side effect and not a symptom of a mental illness. So, all these pharmaceuticals you have to taper and be careful to use but everyone is viewing benzodiazepines as so much more dangerous. 

I wish, benzodiazepines weren't viewed as so dangerous when it's honestly been safer in my experience than any other drug ive taken. What makes its safe is that it's actually RELIABLE and WORKS, there's no need to try messing around much once you are above a certain dose."

insomnia,ey33exa,t1_ey2lq0e,1566754406.0,"Basically, I started developing a substance abuse disorder and in my brain, it's dumb to put effort into something that I can just take a pill for that then makes me in the mood to do that activity. Even something like cleaning my room, it's weird how different SSRIs will effect that, and different off-label medication I've had for anxiety has gotten me engaged in cleaning my room and other tasks I would never think I could be in the mood for.

With these experiences I don't think I can ever use CBT.. Well, I do for exposure therapy, but not for sleep. Breathing suggestions i've heard, and different things, make me pissed off to say the least. I fully give in to sleep hygiene but skeptical of certain research methods they used to reach their conclusions. Bit of a tangent at this point, but how can they say doing any activity other than sleep/sex is bad to do in the bed? To me, accidently putting on headphones and listening to a long boring podcast in my bed with proper dim lighting, i do not see how this doesn't help me get more comfortable with my bed. I think in their study must have been people with the T.V and sound on all night or something.. Anyways, I don't  see how CBT can be better than even someone who just enjoys watching all the senfield reruns and has that to fall back on those bad nights."

What's funny is, joke answers like yours being upvoted but at the same time being *GASP* at benzodiazepines.. it upsets me.. Alcohol, definitely in my experiences causes an euphoria that even Alprazalam doesn't have at all. There's not a point in abusing benzos to me unless you want to be black out then you have a serioues issue on your hand as-is.

Thanks for responding with a clear-point perspective of how mental health system works, if you are able to self advocate a mental hospital is good, but when so much of it is out of your control and you begin being physically restrained and in your mind its for no reason and you wake up not even thinking earth exists anymore, which effects me the most

Honestly the doctor pulled specific answers out of me that were too confusing to directly say, I still don't know if I heard auditory hallucinations or not. Most of the time, when I thought i had auditory hallucinations, it was random sounds like you are saying, and nothing specific.

I have heard with schizophrenia, the voices and sounds you hear are very distinct.

edit: I've abused alcohol a lot, which led to my psychotic break and a state of extreme stress. Im not all anti-alcohol, many doctors stating benzo treatment is like treating someone with alcohol is so wrong though. Alcohol gives you way too much euphoria to have your head straight. If you are having states of acute stress, I think a benzodiazepine pill available over alcohol is way better for keeping your head straight, but it will lower your mood for sure over time."

There are positive studies showing ketamine for treatment resistant depression and then MDMA has a  lot of positive effects hypothetically for social/agoraphobics.
