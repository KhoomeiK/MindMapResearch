To clear things up a bit re. my experiences: Im from Australia. We are a social democracy but certainly have a healthy dose of capitalism within that. Its constantly changing with new governments as they bring in and cut off things they generally state  intent of before an election, especially if its big, so they can say they have a mandate. Ive also spent years working for the government, also in private versions of the same industry later on in life. Australia is not perfect (good to include an example: racism/white australia government policy in the past), nor is the government. Ill try to include examples of where thats the case during this so it doesnt appear like Im just US bashing.

The only reason I brought that up was you stated some things and I wanted to explain how my experiences are different.

BTW your brother sounds a nice bloke. It makes the difference between an ok and great job sometimes.

I guess my experience with the government was a bit different. Both working for them and later in life. I mainly worked in the disability field. I dont buy that the government is doing it for just power, though like with any organisation, public or private, you can get dickheads who try to maximise their benefit. In the disability field and broader community we had organisations that abused clients, sometimes systematically. When this came to light the government brought in some laws to protect clients because enough of these organisations did bad things to clients. Out of this came mandatory training requirements, funding increases, legislative requirements, independant auditors, etc. Without going into too much detail this has changed the amount of abuse incidents by a large amount I believe. The field and organisations were left to mainly self manage and they came up wanting. If the sector had done the right thing it wouldnt have been an issue. So the gov stepped in and dragged the field into the modern era. 

That being said, this costs money. Corruption is an issue but we are trying to get an ICAC federally, NSW had one not too long ago. Checks and balances for fraud are crucial and we dont do enough there.....yet.

As for priests being arrested for not reporting child abuse to secular authorities if local laws now require that to happen, this was in response to the churches failure to self regulate. They have no one to blame but themselves. Its a secular country, the whole country was pretty much horrified at what came out. Its a bit of a stretch to blame that on socialism. Thats just moving the church into whats required of general society: mandatory reporting laws apply to many in the public eyes, thats not singling out christianity. They should have self regulated better over here when they had the chance.

You wrote:

"" I wonder how much of it comes from a genuine desire to help people, and  how much really stems from the fact that those of us in the first world  have such a life of ease. We now have a whole plethora of professionals  and technology to do the work that we used to have to do ourselves, and I  think a part of us now looks to the government to to relieve us of some  of our responsibilities. I'm guilty of feeling this way myself. It's  kind of like how we shuffle the elderly off to nursing homes. ""

Thats my argument in a way: how much of it is a genuine desire to help people? Or let me rephrase. I think capitalism, when mixed with the prosperity gospel, is not at all about a desire to help. Its twisted ""help"" into this bizarre, morally and ethically bankrupt, system where getting rich is inherently a good thing."

I remember seeing a graphic earlier showing life expectancy increasing dramatically over this last hundred years, the world over. I think one of the points youre making is that a good economy is needed to make some of these changes. Hospitals that are well supplied, doctors at the top of their game, so an education system that allows training and development of staff and resources.

And you are right. You need a decent economy to do these things.

I will argue strongly that that does not make a pure capitalist system the best option........by a long shot.

By economic opportunity we could break that down. You have the 1% but how is Joe Average going? Surely thats a better way to look at it from a Christian point of view? Not whats best for the rich, but whats best for the whole of a Christian society? We can talk about wage disparity? How its not managed to look after its citizens during a shocking time of fear and horror the world over with that bloody pandemic? How unadulterated capitalism cant source enough testing kits and PPE from a globalised economy that has other countries generally putting protecting its own citizens above the economy?

You say ""certainly *very important* to help those who are in need, but it doesn't make sense to want them to stay there"" as if thats the only option if you dont support unbridled capitalism. (And thanks for saying you werent implying I did think like that because thats simply not true, I wonder who youve been talking to to hear that) Its not black and white like that. There are other options such as having universal health care in a pandemic, maybe not ripping apart your previous POTUS plans for what to do in a pandemic and funding of organisations to be ready. Its not ok to JUST think about an economy. Pretty soon capitalism becomes cult-like and people start advocating eating their family members for some billionaires ability to maintain their wealth at the expense of their workers, and their families, lives. Its absolutely macabre.

And who is the benefit to?

[https://inequality.org/facts/income-inequality/](https://inequality.org/facts/income-inequality/)

Trickle down economics is a false concept in the real world. It doesnt work. Look at that first graph that shows how much wealth the 90% has versus the next 10%. Economic opportunity? Ok, if you are successful you win the lottery of life, but does the bible really support that sort of winner take all mentality? When its built on a skewed concept that poorer people lives and well being is ok to expend for the 1%? 

Capitalism is fine, it is great to get the economy going and that is important, very important, but it needs to be tempered with something else because its got no heart, no ethics, no morals, and there is more to life than making money, often at others expense.

Pure capitalism is morally and ethically bankrupt imho."

Whats he said thats wrong? 

I reckon hes right on the money for audio engineering, not bedroom producing, but audio engineering, for sure. IMHO. Not gonna call you delusional......but hopefully we can have a chat. This is actually a big part of tracking in studio work.....where audio engineers tend to work, yeah? You could learn something here by the sounds of what you wrote mate. Its nuts and bolts stuff.

Quick google-fu brought this up. Hes not the only one with opinions on mics being important:

audioengineering,fq8nry1,t1_fq30z2u,1589170650.0,"Whats incorrect? 

Given what you said, part of me feels I should tell you where I studied seeing as that seems important to you, but on the other hand I think thats a crap argument to make and a snide comment tbh. Knowledge beats where you studied or if youre self taught. 

So dazzle me with your knowledge good sir.

Assuming you are talking about audio engineering, not bedroom producing of ""beats"", what did he say that was incorrect?"
audioengineering,fq8nr4p,t1_fq3a4lp,1589170633.0,"Bollocks. Thats where most audio engineering was done for years. Its only in the last little while bedroom producing has gone off as tech has got cheap enough.

Hes talking about basic audio engineering theory that applies if you have access to tools. Hes said other times that economics comes into decisions. If you dont have the tools you have to take short cuts. 

Its better to learn the basic theory than just reach for a 57 because thats all you know from your bedroom, better to understand why you should go for the cheaper one, or more expensive one, based on solid theory and experience, not economics, otherwise you need to learn all over again once you have the money and cant just paint via numbers. You can get good CHEAP mics that have these tonal differences so you dont need that U87 to start this process. When I was setting up me and some mates covered different bases re mics to give us options and we'd lend them to each other.

As for coming off condescending, maybe a couple of times, but he also said he worked in sweden (?) so english is probably his second language so maybe cut him some slack. Apart from the odd strange word choice hes been right on the fucking money with his audio engineering theory and hes getting hammered for it. But hes right. Reddit is fucking bizarre sometimes."
audioengineering,fq8g5ut,t1_fq3ghwk,1589165453.0,"Oh, for heavens sake mate. Hes not saying that at all.

Where do sound engineers often work? In studios. What do they have lots of? Mics. If you spend too long EQing you lose money because thats time the studio could be rented out to someone else and you have to pay for your time.

Simply put, its an economic decision. If you use all those things you mentioned as being nonsense, pretentious at that too, which a skilled engineer learns over time using the tools of their trade, you need to EQ probably fuck all because youve got it right at the source. Cut that head fuck out of the EQ job, save money. Simple economics.

&#x200B;

His comment is sound engineering (this sub) based on having the tools you want for the job. If people are reading here and calling someone pretentious because they came here instead of the bedroom producing sub, well, thats on you mate. It sounds like English is his second language given where he said he worked (Sweden or switz? Cant remember), so maybe he hasnt put things perfectly, but mate, if youre throwing around words like pretentious, unreasonable, etc. that should be directed at you maybe? Regarding audio engineering, not bedroom producing, hes on the fucking money. You could learn if you were interested maybe?"
audioengineering,fq8emmz,t1_fq0pbnt,1589164469.0,"True, but EQ introduces artifacts, so if you record it without needing to EQ you'll have less artifacts in your audio, yeah? Which is a good thing?

I was taught to use the EQ as little as possible to preserve the integrity of the track.

Which is great if you are in a studio that has a huge selection of mics, less useful when Im at home with my 57's.

It also is an economic decision in a studio you pay time for. If you have the knowledge about what mic should give the best capture aimed at what you want to record, then you EQ a shitload less and save time and money because of that. Doesnt really matter what type of music, use the mic that suits your creative decision, then youll save time and money by EQing less (get it right at the source, you can polish a turd but it takes time and hence costs money/time). Nothing wrong with recording 5 different mics (if you can get them in the right spot) to get to learn how they change the capture, or to give you more creative options.

So yeah, my understanding is, like you say, so it sounds good. Artifacts are bad. Use least amount of as possible hence use the mic that gives you the closest recording to what you want. If all youve got is a 57, well, thats gonna be whats used.

&#x200B;

Eq to make it sound good, sure, but EQ inherently brings artifacts (well, did when I learnt) so EQ as little as possible too."
castiron,fq5s52a,t1_fq4ucuz,1589115966.0,I try to never put my pets in the oven. Good advice.
audioengineering,fq5g5sp,t1_fq3a4lp,1589104134.0,"Not OP: Ah, theres always economics to consider, but its much quicker (obviously if you have the money) to chose the right mic for the job as you dont need to spend much time agonising over EQ decisions.

Obviously bed room producing at home I work with what I have coz I cant afford everything. But if you hire a studio for a band recording and you know which mics/pre amps to use from their wonderful selection youll save yourself heaps of time cleaning up tracks because they dont sound as you want.

I think EQing introduces artifacts to the audio too, so the less you need to EQ.....

But under all that is economics. I have a few 57's BTW. Also have used studios with a decent selection. Which mic you chose becomes a creative choice depending on what you aim for sound wise. When its a job and you need to get through jobs quickly to put food on the table.....that choice of which mic becomes an economic decision too, because then you have more time to spend with your family instead of trying to EQ tracks that dont sound right. Getting it right at the source can save you heaps of time/money when this is what you do in and day out. Economics."
