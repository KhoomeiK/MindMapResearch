Anxietyhelp,fqti4t5,t3_gkqz3v,1589639463.0,"I've done therapy and I've read several anxiety books (4 or 5), and I can honestly say the two teach a lot of the same techniques. Individual talk therapy is ideal but reading books will at least help you change your perspective and it's a fraction of the cost.

Betterhelp has financial aid you can apply for and get quite easily, but it's still pretty pricey. There are a ton of other therapy services out there, and many offices offer sliding scale pricing. If you can find any way to afford even 2 months of therapy, it can go a long way.

[K Health](https://www.khealth.ai/anxiety-depression) does anxiety treatment (medication) with chat consultations and messaging for $34/month, including the medicine shipped to you. The service is a little wonky but it's the cheapest price I've seen for such a thing without insurance.

Plush Care accepts insurance if you have it.

[Alpha Medical](https://www.helloalpha.com/mental-health/) also has a mental health membership (medication) for $120/year, and it accepts insurance for the meds. If you don't have insurance the cash prices are still quite low.

I guess my point is yes there are ways to treat yourself via books, meditation, lifestyle, mental techniques/exercises. But don't write off professional help because some ways are more affordable than others. You'll have the most success with a combination of all of the above."

Finally talked to a psychiatrist about medication, expressing concerns I had RE: SSRIs/SNRIs. We landed on buspirone. After just 2 weeks I felt a huge shift in my daily mood/anxiety. I started to relax and enjoy things again.

I also quit all the supplements when I decided to talk to the psych, and I have to say they are not without side effects. It became obvious when I stopped them. 

All this to say, if you are willing to try prescriptions, I'd recommend having a discussion with a doc rather than self-medicating with combinations of supps. It's more controlled, an expert is advising you, it's often cheaper, and....well frankly none of that would matter to me, but for the fact that the supps didn't work. YMMV."
Anxiety,fpg1iga,t1_fpfs2j3,1588591291.0,"Going to offer a quick alternative view to both of you. Anxiety can also talk you out of ever making big, scary, like-altering changes. Us people with anxiety tend to shrink our worlds until they are only the most comfortable, familiar settings possible. And even then it can creep in (when it's 'generalized') and you can feel anxious just sitting on your own couch. 

The idea that you should be able to be happy anywhere is nice, but if you think you'd benefit from relocation then seriously consider it. The cons *and* the pros. I moved 800 miles north to a liberal metro area after 28 years in the deep red bigoted south, and I feel a peace in my soul here I never knew possible. The year leading up to this move was absolutely horrifying due to my anxiety but it was 110% the right thing for me in the end.

Learning a new area is not a bad thing, becoming a resident is not impossible, staying in touch with family is something people do every day, etc. It's just interesting because I read your post and see a list of fears, very much like inside my own mind. You very well made the right choice for yourself, but I wanted to offer this perspective for anyone else reading this.

It's called diurnal swing. The tl;dr is your cortisol levels are at their highest first thing in the morning. It's thought to be for the purpose of waking us up, but obviously to people with anxiety and sensitive to cortisol, it feels terrible. It's even a separate section of the [cortisol wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol) page.

Obviously the usual things should help; exercise, mindfulness, healthy sleep and diet, therapy, what have you. Possibly ashwagandha because it has been demonstrated to lower cortisol levels over time. But what works best for me with this specific type of anxiety is noting it, and constantly reminding myself it will fade. This will pass. I will feel different by 10am, lunch, etc. And I do. However if I allow myself to get swept up and catastrophize over it, then I can spin out and ruin a whole day.

Sickening."

StackAdvice,fgf92bb,t1_fgf394m,1580730662.0,"Second vote for ashwagandha, particularly if you are someone who'd benefit from cortisol reduction. It's affordable, safe, and has a promising collection of research to support anxiety reduction that many other supplements just don't have (yet).

I'd also throw out Silexan (lavender) because the research behind it is impressive and it's about $10-$12/month. I only stopped taking it because it made my stomach hurt."
StackAdvice,fgf8xh1,t1_fgf34uq,1580730493.0,">has a high success rate in helping with anxiety

Do you (or anybody) have any more info regarding this? I've considered NAC a few times since I see it mentioned here, but it has ostensibly no research supporting anxiety relief according to [examine.com](https://examine.com)."
politics,fg0oyto,t1_fg0omv5,1580412190.0,"It’s pathetic. If it were closer to 2016, he’d just say “they’re trying to overturn the election” (hell, they do say that). Closer to 2020, say “it’s an election year”. Eat shit."

Rhodiola is more of a stim/cognitive supp. You'd probably do better with something more studied for depression like St. John's Wort, vitamin D3, fish oil."

Anxietyhelp,fffdecl,t1_ffd0tr8,1579881503.0,"I do agree. Exercise is so vital to regulating countless functions of the brain and body; it’s not up for debate. 

Which made me feel even more hopeless, as someone who developed anxiety after years of running, working out, eating a healthy diet, and sleeping well. I would give anything for my lifestyle to be the problem, lol. But I cannot imagine the dire straits I’d be in without all those locked in place. 

Now I’m working to rewire my brain through therapy, meditation, mindfulness, etc. It’s so much harder than getting in shape because you can’t guarantee it or quantify it. Just rambling for anyone who is in a similar boat as me and needs to hear they’re not alone. ✊"
Nootropics,fffckj7,t1_fffagd7,1579880980.0,"Wholeheartedly agree. I never felt like myself on BC, across several different types. It was disturbing to experience. This needs to be talked about more."
Meditation,ffexxo6,t1_ffdgs0i,1579869878.0,"It's a paid subscription offered by Amazon where you get unlimited access to a huge library, rather than having to buy books individually. I don't normally have it, but they had a deal where you could get 3 months for 99 cents so I jumped on it."
ChicagoSuburbs,ffcl171,t1_ffc9bz9,1579801714.0,Yeah reporters always seem to have trouble with this. Just say making DST permanent!
Meditation,ffchp1j,t1_ffcftrr,1579799691.0,I probably shouldn’t have used the word traditional. What I’m trying to say is I don’t typically connect with methods that rely on some kind of ‘spirituality’ (magic?) to work.
Meditation,ffceg9u,t1_ffcbtcn,1579797700.0,"Thanks for the recs, I feel the same as you. The Mind Illuminated is on Kindle Unlimited so I’m going to read that. ‘Written by a neuroscientist’ is much more up my alley than the traditional approach. My therapist has me doing meditation and mindfulness to re-train my brain out of years of anxiety, so I love any extra credit I can do to understand/implement it better."
politics,ff6cvak,t1_ff6a0ds,1579624432.0,"Agree with you both. When Warren came out first (of the candidates) for impeachment, that’s when she became my #1. It was a huge bold move at the time when everyone was still “should we, shouldn’t we”ing. Of fucking course you should do your constitutional duty. 

Conversely, Bernie’s delay and some of his comments during that time stuck with me. 

Obviously I’ll vote blue no matter who. But Warren is my gal in the primary."

Mindfulness,ff45ruo,t1_ff3indo,1579556155.0,"This is my problem too, the more I think about eating the more anxious I get. It’s not the food, it’s just that my appetite goes away when I’m anxious and I also get nauseous. So over time I’ve associated that with anxiety around meals. However if I’m watching TV or something it’s usually fine.

I will also add that “eating mindfully”, putting utensils down between bites, etc. are techniques I used to use so that I’d feel full and ultimately eat less when I was younger. Probably super useful for your average adult, but I want to gain if anything so I can’t really do it these days. Bums me out, I hope we can overcome this."
StackAdvice,ff373a3,t3_er96co,1579535251.0,"Adding to the feedback you’re getting here, lavender (silexan) is one of the promising supplements for anxiety per Examine.com. It performed as well as Ativan and Paxil in studies (6 weeks). Anyone tried it?"
