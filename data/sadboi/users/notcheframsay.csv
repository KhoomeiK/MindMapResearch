Needafriend,fowmtoz,t3_g8vuq9,1588122898.0,I‚Äôm interested! American F24
AMA,fokcc1s,t1_fokanum,1587839418.0,lol No worries!
AMA,foiasiy,t1_fohvam6,1587782377.0,Oh yeah. There‚Äôs a whole array of apps and websites. Some better than others
AMA,fohv1n5,t1_fogkdr3,1587773189.0,"At the time, yes. If he had given me the option when we split up to stay together, just without ""and arrangement,"" then I'm sure I would've done that."
AMA,fohurbs,t1_fogle98,1587773030.0,"It really depends. There are so many reasons. Some people are just lonely and feel like they need to compensate someone in order to spend time with them. I think for other people it just makes them feel good to support someone. A lot of the time (at least in my experience) people of significant means tend to go for much younger sugar babies, so it could be that a younger person makes them feel young. And other times I think high rollers might just like to feel powerful/like they have control or influence over someone else. The latter is obviously a more nefarious reason for pursuing the lifestyle but it definitely does exist."
AMA,fohu6zr,t1_fognkvq,1587772724.0,Nope
AMA,fohu6e5,t1_fogwo7q,1587772714.0,"I guess I can kind of see why people might say that, since it seems like it's just an exchange of material goods for sex. But I think there is a distinction. Being a sugar baby is more about being compensated for your time than specifically meeting for sex and being paid for that."
AMA,fohtoi7,t1_foh20j0,1587772442.0,"I honestly used to joke about it with some of my friends too. At first I kind of just made a profile out of curiosity, not necessarily planning on acting on it. I started out on Seeking Arrangement. So once I started getting offers for decent amounts of money just to go out on a date, that's when I started seriously considering it."
AMA,fogk9rp,t1_foghv22,1587753634.0,"At one point, yes, on my end. I think that also may have been a contributing factor to why he broke it off."
AMA,foghmxm,t1_fogfat0,1587752695.0,"I come from an average middle class family and I had my eye on a pricey lifestyle that I couldn't afford on my own. I also just happen to like dating older men, which is a plus."
AMA,foghj5j,t1_fogf4rv,1587752656.0,"He was 54, and I was 20. He wold give me $4-500 US weekly, not including gifts from time to time."
AMA,fogheao,t1_fogeip7,1587752607.0,"We met online on a website specifically for the purpose of linking up wealthy men with attractive younger ladies. It was a very good relationship and I enjoyed the experience. Unfortunately he broke it off due to a mix of factors. He was separated from his wife, but the divorce was a long, drawn out issue, which cost him a lot of money. He also was getting really busy with work as a surgeon and so he didn't have as much time and money as he would've liked for the relationship to continue."
AMA,fogh268,t1_fogdnoh,1587752485.0,"I don't mind at all. I'm currently 24, but at the time I was 20. I only had one sugar daddy, who at the time was 54."
AMA,foggyqu,t1_fogcefn,1587752451.0,Designer handbag
AMA,foggxid,t1_fogcbt7,1587752440.0,It ended amicably. He was the one who broke things off though. But he was very kind about it and told me to keep his number and call him if I ever wanted to get together and meet for lunch or something just to talk and see each other.
AMA,foggp0e,t1_fogcaoj,1587752357.0,"Hey! We met online. Not on Seeking Arrangement but a similar one. Some are better than others. If you mean reputation in the context of the quality of the site for actually connecting, I'd give it a B. There are definitely plenty of men on there who really do want to share their wealth with beautiful women. On the other hand, there are also a lot of sleezy guys who think of it as an escort site."
AMA,foggedj,t1_fogc6r3,1587752246.0,"Ice cream, duh"
Needafriend,foe83tv,t1_foe13yp,1587697953.0,Sounds swell
bipolar,fo4j1uu,t1_fnwaiey,1587505320.0,Good to know. Thanks
bipolar,fo4j036,t1_fo08p1d,1587505294.0,Agreed about the weather. Thanks for the inspiration!
bipolar,fo02rl2,t3_g4g2jb,1587405068.0,Looks great. Happy to hear you‚Äôre doing better.
bipolar,fnw4a9k,t3_g47nf3,1587311139.0,Good for you! Any tips for quitting? I use it as a coping mechanism for stress unfortunately.
bipolar,fn7keu5,t1_fn6q4ly,1586722091.0,Thanks a lot
bipolar,fn6kzl9,t1_fn3hqt8,1586701872.0,"I‚Äôll bring it up at my follow-up this month. I was frustrated by my last visit because his recommendation for a low carb or keto diet doesn‚Äôt really align with my lifestyle. Not to say that I‚Äôm not trying to cut out junk and eat more Whole Foods. I just feel that if meds are the cause of me gaining weight, how am I supposed to counteract that purely with diet changes alone?"
bipolar,fn3npjv,t3_fyv24r,1586624371.0,Thanks for the input
bipolar,fn3di0k,t1_fn34g6g,1586618482.0,Thanks for the advice. That's super helpful.
bipolar,fn3df73,t1_fn34omh,1586618434.0,"I'm on a few different meds. It took a while to find a combo that really worked for me. Most recently, (February I think) my doc added Abilify. Before that I'd been on Zoloft and Lamictal (anticonvulsant) for about 2 and a half years.
I brought up weight gain to the psychiatrist but he was (and really, so was I) hesitant to remove any meds since I've been doing well with the combination of the three. Just kinda sucks but maybe it's a necessary evil?"
bipolar,fn33wvn,t1_fn33to8,1586612193.0,Are you doing it as a long-term lifestyle choice or just to take weight off? Just curious. Thanks
unpopularopinion,fn2rfth,t1_fn2fhm4,1586600301.0,I definitely agree that they‚Äôre both bad
unpopularopinion,fn2rclv,t1_fn241xl,1586600198.0,It‚Äôs wrong and traumatic regardless. My post is not meant to downplay anyone else‚Äôs trauma. I agree that you should seek professional help
bipolar,fn20ef8,t1_fn1zyz8,1586574585.0,That‚Äôs super helpful to know. Thanks
bipolar,fn201nm,t1_fn1zi48,1586574329.0,Good to know. Thanks!
unpopularopinion,fn1xllh,t1_fn1xeee,1586572568.0,Sorry you have to go through that. I think some people read into my post differently than how it was meant but what you‚Äôre saying is exactly what I‚Äôm talking about.
unpopularopinion,fn1v1ii,t1_fn1my5d,1586570782.0,I‚Äôm referring to common usage of the two terms
unpopularopinion,fn1uyuk,t3_fymswm,1586570731.0,Thank you
unpopularopinion,fn1uwrx,t1_fn1l3r1,1586570691.0,Couldn‚Äôt agree more
unpopularopinion,fn1urhk,t1_fn1iodr,1586570591.0,That‚Äôs a valid opinion to have
unpopularopinion,fn0vbo0,t1_fn0uhuy,1586549449.0,That‚Äôs a valid point. I didn‚Äôt think of it that way.
unpopularopinion,fn0u73w,t1_fn0tkey,1586548818.0,I would say not
legaladvice,fn0qugu,t3_fe6v1u,1586547006.0,Thanks for the responses.
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fn0nmac,t3_fyh2p7,1586545267.0,Bless your soul üôè
RandomActsofCards,fiuz7db,t3_f9x3it,1582750912.0,That‚Äôs so cute I‚Äôd love to send a card. Pm me address please?
RandomActsofCards,fiuz2ry,t3_f9w60h,1582750847.0,Pm me where to send! Kind regards
Needafriend,ffzsedg,t3_ew46od,1580391540.0,Aww that made me actually LOL so thanks for that üòÑ
lewronggeneration,ffzsbel,t1_ffzbeph,1580391471.0,Maybe if you consider 24+ old. I also have all and I like it that way
Needafriend,ffzn5t7,t3_ew46od,1580386690.0,"Honestly most of the feedback has been from men but I‚Äôd be open to as long as you‚Äôre not going to get off on it (nothing personal, disclaimer due to other responses)"
Needafriend,ffzmli5,t1_ffzlk18,1580386080.0,"I‚Äôm not comfortable giving that out, sorry"
niceguys,ffpzmhy,t1_ffplxsm,1580112515.0,"Honestly same. I know some other countries have different laws but smoking is so restricted in the U.S. it feels almost impossible to in public. It just seems like so much less relevant of an issue nowadays that I agree it doesn‚Äôt really affect other people.
Sorry just annoying for random people who think it‚Äôs appropriate to judge my entire life for it"
AskMen,fdpdwsp,t1_fdouwx5,1578626152.0,"I‚Äôm sure your actions are very much appreciated. I always try to be vigilant and do the same when possible. It couldn‚Äôt hurt to ask, IMO, and I feel sad that more people feel too awkward/nervous/whatever the case when in a potentially sticky situation."
