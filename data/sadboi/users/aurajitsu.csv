infj,fcj25kv,t3_ehbhw0,1577675401.0,"This is so great that you are posting about an INTJ trying to get close to an INFJ! 

I have a similar story, though we met online, my now INTJ boyfriend was very intent on playing all his cards right. I could tell he had thought out a lot about how to ask me out. 

We‚Äôd have very deep conversations over the phone, he was the only one that actually called me (our of the guys I marched online with) and I started to look forward to it. After a fun conversation-he‚Äôd ask me out and it would always work.

I fell for him through our deep and personal conversations and the way he talked about his career and passions. He was very thoughtful and set boundaries very clear and gently in the beginning. I could tell he wanted all the right things and it made me realize I wanted it too.

By this I mean he would say ‚Äúin time, I‚Äôll get to know you better.‚Äù Or he‚Äôd say ‚Äúthe more I hear you talk- the more I like you.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need someone that is dependent of me emotionally. I need someone that is very independent.‚Äù He made it clear of his needs and wants.

He was very respectful and open to a lot of things. It was a win in my INFJ heart.
