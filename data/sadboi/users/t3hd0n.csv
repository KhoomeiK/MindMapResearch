I also assumed they didn't have an (unsupported) opinion about how each girl felt about them.

With those assumptions, imo it's fairly black and white. Add in other factors and Tom still wouldn't be ""unlucky"", but not an irredeemable creep deserving what he got based on this interaction in isolation."

relationships,fqj42m2,t3_gj3oea,1589404763.0,">So my question is, would guys do this much for someone they just wanted to bang?

possibly yes, but he'd be ghosting/slowghosting/breadcrumbing you after or would otherwise be grooming you into an abusive relationship. make sure he's not love bombing you, and otherwise build trust by looking at all of his actions and not just the ones revolving around sex. basically you want to be at a point where you can trust that the words he's saying match the intent of his actions so that when your anxiety is getting triggered you can say ""i trust him to say what he means and mean what he says"".

with anxiety, there's a line between ""healthy boundaries"" and ""unrealistic expectations"". a common one for example is when someone has anxiety about being cheated on. their ""boundaries"" aren't reasonable, like making their partner cut whole groups of people (ie, the ppl they'd be attracted to) out of their life.

i see way more posts where people are coming from this guys perspective, ex""my partner/person i'm seeing/etc is has high anxiety issues about <thing>, *how do i not trigger them*?"" in those cases their person is setting unrealistic expectations instead of healthy boundaries. effectively the person's anxiety is becoming so much of an issue that its affecting their ability to have healthy relationships, *which is a clear indicator of when someone should be seeking therapy.*

> I feel like there’s something missing on my end

from my perspective, i'd see that as an inability to connect with your wants/needs/emotions. therapy certainly would help with that. tbh dialing down or removing the sex isn't going to change the things you have problems with, however ""in a relationship i need to have a romantic connection to someone i'm having sex with"" is a perfectly healthy thing to say."
