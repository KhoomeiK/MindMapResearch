depression_help,fn9oa2j,t1_fn92l4n,1586780073.0,"When I'm still on college things get pilled up or I got some sort of feeling getting overwhelm when I failed to learn something and if I learn something quite behind from others, I know there are stares that tells you that you're dumb or they knew they are superior. Or my ego can't accept the fact that I'm dumber than what I expected. Also felt embarrassed when others have learn something and you have to make ways for others to tell you how so you may catch up."

MentalHealthPH,fj5eg2o,t3_fb9rkh,1583030709.0,"Can relate. Hindi nila ako siniseryoso, usually ibabalik nila sisi sakin, usually sasabihin nila kakacelphone, lagi ka nagfb etc (partly true but just a symptoms of the big sad/anxiety). 

Boomers parents ko usually pag nagvent out ako na mga depressive taughts usually sagot nila idaan s dasal or faith based sagot lagi, pero kung ako tatanungin walang talab s depressive episodes ko (not proselytizing atheism, if prayers works for you then continue). Kaya sa mga mh group na lng ako nag vent out kesa sarilinin ko sobrang bigat parang di ko kaya.

Laban lang tayo."

Most of most of my peer are earning 6 figure by now, some are travelling the world, doing strides in their chosen field. Though I was lucky having a job but most people my age in the office are having expertise in their chosen field, it's pretty hard to feel happy in a ultra competitive field wherein I'm feeling left out, slinging feces on everything I do. Sometimes even answering the phone becomes a tedious tasks, even replyong to an email. Fuck I sling feces on simple task at the office.
