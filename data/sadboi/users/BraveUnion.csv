GetStudying,fqnakgy,t3_gjour3,1589491472.0,biggest tip I can give is to start early. I find personally as the day goes on I get more inclined to procrastinate but when  I start early I am in the study mode a lot longer. another thing is having a study group. I used to go to the library with my friends for my final secondary exam which is basically college entrance exams. Lastly making it a habit is everything so reassure yourself every day that the next will be even easier. good luck bro.
