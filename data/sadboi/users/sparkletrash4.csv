AmItheAsshole,fqzburj,t3_gleeti,1589764106.0,Stop this now. My mom always comments on ANYTHING I made myself or ate. I have a HUGE food problem to this day and still don’t like eating in front of her and don’t like to eat in front of people I don’t know that we’ll. I even went to culinary school and she would almost mock me about it. I graduated and she didn’t come. I let her win though and worked in the front of the house instead. Never put my coat back on. Please don’t be like this.
oddlysatisfying,fqz9zxp,t1_fqysyd0,1589762999.0,Literally best part of this video. I’d look up kingdom hearts lofi that’s what it sounded like to me.
oddlysatisfying,fqz9x77,t1_fqyem3c,1589762954.0,Thank you! I was like are we not going to talk about the lofi kingdom hearts banger that was just playing!?
ContagiousLaughter,fqa0u9h,t1_fq9zao7,1589210773.0,Yea tyler can get it.
relationship_advice,fq4za6f,t3_gcez2h,1589087903.0,Oh lord I can relate to this. To immediately get defensive and angry. Someone really must have made her feel so bad for he hobby at some point. You are amazing for being kind and understanding and giving her a safe place to do as she pleases. Not to mention admitting you were wrong for laughing. I wish you two the longest and happiest marriage. I can only hope to be as lucky and find ANYONE even a friend to be so understanding.
insaneparents,fpvvfzl,t3_gfkq2z,1588952550.0,Maybe some science and biology too.
PublicFreakout,fpvvc98,t3_gfsikn,1588952498.0,Sometimes I get really embarrassed about shit I’ve done. Sometimes it makes me not go to a party If someone is there that made a fool of myself in front of or whatever. But this. Jesus. At least I never did anything like this.
AmItheAsshole,fpvu7ix,t1_fpv6ttq,1588951917.0,Right wtf I just have anxiety and this would fuck with me. Not only then but much after cuz I would honestly think my friends don’t like me or something to collectively fuck with me that hard. I was gas lit about something pretty small once and even that wasn’t a good feeling I felt insane and didn’t know why I didn’t remember something cuz I KNEW it didn’t happen. Even as a prank or something light hearted I can’t see enjoying that feeling. Especially SEEING something other people don’t. Yea no this isn’t a “prank”
AmItheAsshole,fpvthan,t3_gflupe,1588951536.0,Absolutely NTA Ew who the fuck does that!? This is super messed up. I’m not schizophrenic but just have bad anxiety and his would really mess me up. During and after because I would have realized my friends are collective group of utter assholes and honestly I’d probably spiral for a bit. I’m so sorry you had to go through this. I’m glad your in groups and know people in your own community so you still have friends outside of this group of douchebags.
Anger,fpt6xfa,t1_fpt3c87,1588885932.0,I did end up commenting that of some sort. I know it sounds silly. I’ve just been trying to get away from my “crazy angry persona” so anytime I go on a rant I just feel so much shame after. I’ve been self isolating a few months before all this to wait for insurance from my job to get a therapist. I also realized I should have went to r/offmychest so thanks forgot being cool and saying something kind.
MomForAMinute,fpl1ld7,t1_fpkouij,1588704763.0,You’re literally the best the whole thread makes my heart full.

Can you be my mom? lmao I’m almost 30 but still lmao I live on my own and will bring good Thanksgiving side dishes! Motherhood is very hard and I’m trying to forgive my own mom because she did the best she could but girl you are killing the game. Your kids are very lucky.
MomForAMinute,fpkhfvm,t3_gdhpiu,1588694758.0,Thanks for letting her express her self and do this I’m literally tearing up and what a cool relationship you must have. Even she’s just chilling eating an orange and letting you take a candid photo of her seems simple enough but to me says everything about your relationship.

AnimalCrossing,fopuyko,t1_foojobu,1587972995.0,I think that’s what really gives it that sky scraper city feel and I’m obsessed and must see what was done with the surrounding area.

fightporn,fop36xe,t1_fop30j6,1587952072.0,That’s a good way to put it. I really relate to that. That’s awesome you stuck with your trade.
fightporn,fop26fk,t1_fop1sk1,1587951438.0,Oh same! That’s what job corps is like a trade school. I did culinary. They paid for it so that was nice and I got to live in sf for free for 2 years. I wasn’t a “bad kid” I was goth in a place that wasn’t that normal. I grew up in the hood. So I was defending myself but I LOOKED like trouble. Idk my whole highschool career was very strange they put be straight in continuation school right out of middle school.
fightporn,fop1ky0,t1_foontwv,1587951061.0,You coulda gone to job corps and got a diploma that’s what I ended up doing. But they only let in certain people.
fightporn,fop1g0n,t1_fooxh3f,1587950976.0,My favorite teachers were in my continuation schools. You’re awesome and your attitude in this comment just let’s me know you’re one of the “good teachers” you’re gunna impact a lot of kids to turn their life around. Thank you.

MadeMeSmile,foi6t7m,t1_foi1ama,1587779916.0,We have a shop dog in my store and she’s not very friendly and keeps to herself in the corner.

AmItheAsshole,fofotr2,t3_g72ody,1587740151.0,Saying what you did was the fucking truth!!! My mom also did this to me around that age. I’m 28 I still think I’m fat and the scale says I’m fat but all my friends and people I know say otherwise and I have a horrendous relationship with food to this day. My mom was always putting me on diets and calling me fat. I can now not eat in front of her and am constantly aware of people seeing what I’m eating. I’ve been bulimic on and off for YEARS and can’t bring myself to tell a doctor to see if I’ve made serious damage. Please don’t let her keep doing this.
AnimalCrossing,fo9eafa,t1_fo9e1nh,1587617157.0,I thought as much but I just had to hear it from someone on here lol thanks.
Anxiety,fo76ry8,t1_fo6zhyy,1587573226.0,Im literally just Commenting in any cbd comment to further reiterate This is what everyone should be looking into that thc hasn’t helped!
Anxiety,fo76ks0,t1_fo6lk7f,1587573128.0,Yes yes yes cbd has amazing anxiety properties as well as so many more. I smoke thc everyday but have a cbd vape for when I’m feeling over whelmed or just off at all and it helps a lot.
Anxiety,fo76ann,t3_g5zaev,1587572992.0,cbd is actually amazing for anxiety and they have actually flower in cbd as well as capes edibles and topicals. Cbd is also totally legal and can be sent most places please hit me up if you have a hard time finding it and would like some.
chinaglass,fo3z2eo,t1_fo1ubjq,1587495391.0,I definitely got mine from dhgate not that long ago and was here in 5 days. It’s not impossible. I also figured they had a warehouse of this and that in the US.

AnimalCrossing,fno362t,t1_fmx1q1y,1587110362.0,Omg yes! I was saying this to someone recently that the music is different in that movie. I was so excited to hear the songs again thank you so much for linking that.

Dabs,fnaut7h,t1_fnad9gm,1586804202.0,I have so many glass jars. What do we do with them!?
Whatcouldgowrong,fnaaxye,t1_fn9rg49,1586794276.0,Yea she definitely tries to get her to stop grabbing her instead of putting down her drink and helping someone that obviously needs help. She probably could have at least prevented her from hitting her chin on the table. But at the same time they are all probably drunk so I can understand.
Dabs,fn7bc6g,t1_fn6c7xf,1586716966.0,I was afraid it would get even messier like that. I ended up scraping most of it up though. I said it was fire earlier but the more I smoke it the more I’m “meh” about it. The grape tart was better
Dabs,fn5k7r1,t1_fn5k2s2,1586667121.0,I just scooped up and dabbed what was on the lid. I was careful and got most of it up. Orange creamsicle. Fucking delicious. Thanks for the tip though.

Anxiety,fmpearp,t3_fwm9rl,1586279303.0,"I understand this. I’m freaking out right now about how I jokingly was super upset someone said water is wet. And someone laughed at my joke and was like “why are you so passionate?” And another person saying “haha you’re so animated” like totally going along with my joke and they probably think I’m funny since I made a joke. Nope I’m freaking out they thought I was serious and think I’m super fucking weird for being actually angry at “water is wet” I need fucking help 

I did see that post where the girl said “when you’re embarrassed like that try to remember someone else’s bad choice or embarrassing moment and you probably can’t and that means people arnt thinking about you’re either” that helped me a bit"

BeautyGuruChatter,fm6mkks,t1_fm5bh93,1585797584.0,Same! I was allowed to do it but thinking back never actually achieved it and was more cringe than anything. But I definitely still listen to the music and wear tribute pieces of clothing like when the checkered slip on vans came back. YES

Dabs,fm1xalx,t1_fm1wzb5,1585686682.0,I’ve switch it already for sure but with all the stink about Silicone I was curious about people’s opinions on companies using it. You apparently lose terps when sitting in silicone for too long. And was wondering if it’s packaged like this and sitting on the floor for a long time if it would in fact lose terps or if it’s more of a problem for more saucy concentrates.
tooktoomuch,fm1tbk7,t1_fm1qeiy,1585684632.0,Oh yea definitely. but I wasn’t making them too strong and when I say they had some I mean they tasted a BIT of the dough lol and was saying they were really high.
