I’ve had an unhappy relationship with my mother. She’s been one of the primary reasons that led to my developing, and still being unable to move on from, an eating disorder. She doesn’t legitimise mental illness, has slut shamed me for even my walk, laughed me off both times i broke down in front of her and told her i was suicidal. Since then she’s made it a point to judge every suicide we hear of as a coward’s way out, in my hearing. In seventh grade, she called me a prostitute for talking to my friends in class. She’s used me against my father, mocked me in front of the family, in front of my friend’s parents when i was in school - in my final year I’d gone through severe depression and I’d lost all ambition - she reminded me I was worthless and when I’d gone from anorexia to months of insomnia and late night bulimic episodes she’d go on triggering. Over and over, every night. 
I saved myself, made it to one of the best colleges, fulfilled her dreams - and of course she takes credit. Is sweet to me for weeks. I don’t blame her, I’ve not been easy to keep. They’ve been good days. Days we don’t fight. Days we dress up. Days we love a little. 
I just try, it’s hard for me, I’ll be honest, hurts my pride - i let her in. I try. Over and over again. Isn’t this supposed to work? She’s my mother, after all - but it just doesn’t. 
Sometimes i miss the idea of her, by god, and being forced to come back home for quarantine makes me see how strange we are to each other. Wrote her poem on sunday to try to fix things. She’s not acknowledged it. I just don’t understand. I’ve gotten so cold I don’t even know if i want to save anything now. But what I wouldn’t give for what I’ve missed"

You’ve allowed yourself the regret. Fine. Now move over it - and remember you’re in berkeley! That’s incredible! It’s a chance people die for - look at how far you’ve come, and of how proud your parents are. 
You were offered a chance you turned down for reasons that still apply today. Remind yourself of them, and where you’d be if you hadn’t listened. As for all the success of the graduates there: who says you can’t make it for yourself? You’ve got a great platform to work from. Trust me, you’ve got this. 
Don’t beat yourself up - you didn’t MISS an opportunity. You made a decision and you’ve got to come to terms with it. And do not throw the rest of your life over thinking what could’ve been. There’s a lot of stress rn, but trust me, it’s all going to pay off. And really, truly, your college doesn’t put a cap on where you end up on. Or even a lower cap - who says the stress in the other college wouldnt drive you to a worse place mentally?"
offmychest,fo9l44i,t3_g6heyz,1587622709.0,"Hey, first off, hugs to you. 
Not loving yourself is one of the hardest things to undo. 
Speaking as someone who’s just finished a week recovering from anorexia/bulimia, I’m telling you: this is a spiral in. If you’re having thoughts like these, starving yourself is NOT the answer, it’ll make it worse, I swear. You’ll be trading with little moments of happiness and love and harming your body beyond belief and not even feel successful about it. 
And keeping this aside, to be frank, crash diets really don’t work. Forcing weight loss just justifies weight gain later. 
If you really wish to lose weight, I’ll be honest and tell you that starving might get you there. You might end up skinny. Go through hell for it. Become someone you don’t recognise. Hurt people around you. And either die of it, or recover  and hit this happy stage you can reach NOW without starving. 
If you’re working for better health, IF is pretty good, but do ensure you’re getting all you need. Exercise is lovely, does help with the self love. Research and find what works for you. 
Remember you’re worthy either way. If you ever don’t feel this, feel free to text me anytime!

I can’t really explain it very well, but there’s just so much to come. So many days of sunshine and happiness and late nights up with the people you love. Okay, maybe you’ll get two, three good days after a hundred bad ones. Most of us do. Yes, life is repetitive (probably aggravated due to the lockdown) but I’m guessing you’re still in school. It’ll be over soon, and whatever excitement youre looking for, i promise you you’ll get. 
You’re still so young, remember of what it’ll cost your parents, your friends, and us strangers if you give up too soon. My younger brother’s 13 this year - and the thought of losing him is just the most terrible thought I’ve had to address. 

I’m telling you: don’t give up. Don’t lose hope. Try little things you can do... pretend.  Find a schedule. Take up something new, something healthy. I can’t really offer you anything new, but I’d love to talk to you, help you out in any way i can. I was suicidal at 13 too, and I’m so glad I stayed. You’ll realise it doesn’t get easier but there’s just so much that makes it worth the fight ❤️❤️❤️"

I use music to drown them out when I’m working, do my chores, sit with work in the middle of the house so they think I’m “spending” time with them, and everyone’s happy.

The rest of the days, I really cut. Only tomatoes for lunch and dinner, and no breakfast, so logically I don’t see a point and I don’t feel the need to. Of course anytime I eat ANYTHING extra i need to purge - so i try to avoid getting to that point. 
Also, one thing that stopped me doing the 4-5 times daily purge thing is the effect it was having on my body, my hands were ripped, i used to vomit blood and injure my mouth pretty bad, and I was terrified of passing out or idk popping something - I’ve heard of people whose lungs collapsed. I didn’t want to give bulimia that power. Also binging- I’m in college, so I keep myself pretty busy and broke enough to avoid binges. It’s very weird. We’re all still groping our way i guess.
