DecidingToBeBetter,f4v7wio,t3_dly1u6,1571838079.0,"For me has helped to think if I would say the same things I tell myself to a friend or a loved one. Kinda like ""Imagine you are your own best friend"". I learned to notice when I had negative self talk, realise I would never say that to my best friend and then say to myself what I would tell my best friend instead. Overtime it gets easier, at first it felt very tough. I am far from perfect in this, but it has helped me."
Journaling,f26u487,t3_dbz04k,1570023419.0,I second the blog. You can use WordPress or wix.com for it. There are also plenty of other tools for that in the internet.

I am very happy for you that it has been of so much help :)"
selfimprovement,f0vixe8,t3_d6tso3,1568983165.0,"This is great advice, thank you for sharing.

I have been trying to do this, but it's very difficult. What has helped has been thinking ""What would you do/say if you were your own best friend?"""
DecidingToBeBetter,f0virao,t3_d6tesd,1568983011.0,"That's great you confessed, but unfortunately it is only the beginning. If you confessed today, she probably is still trying to figure out everything you told her and understand what is going on. There will be a rollercoaster coming and I hope you will do your hardest to make it up to her and help her heal. 

I suggest you check out r/asoneafterinfidelity and r/survivingmyinfidelity

They are great resources for reconciliation and working on the relationship.

Best of luck to you and your partner."

Very cool looking journal btw!"
AsOneAfterInfidelity,er4n3g4,t3_c0gssr,1560499510.0,"I think you just have to support your BS best you can and show her through actions and consistency that you are becoming safe partner for her. Eventually, when reconciliation is far enough, you could try to gently encourage her to try to make new friends, who don't associate with AP. For now though,most likely all her energy is going into survival, that's how it was for me atleast.

I am bit confused by the lack of evidence. Don't you yourself have evidence of the affair? Maybe you can talk with BS and suggest that you provide (or BS provides) all your evidence to APs spouse? After that it would be up to that spouse what to do with the info, but then you can have peace of mind that you did not hide it from him. It might be that with lack of evidence AP manipulated the spouse to think your BS is lying."
