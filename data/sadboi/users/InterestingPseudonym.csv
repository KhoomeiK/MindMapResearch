I've been searching for miracles for my hyperpigmentation when all I needed was sunscreen. I was adamant I didn't need it unless I was going out and there was sun or a chance of sun. I thought people who wore it all the time were ridiculous, that it was too much and they were overreacting, like it was a second skin or something. Fuck me was I wrong. 

I've run out of almost all my serums and the thing to make the most difference in over a year has been just wearing sunscreen. I've been doing it every day for the past few weeks and I'm already seeing a difference. Even when I'm just at home. But my flat picks up all the sunlight so.. 

If it's cloudy and I'm not going out I tend to skip it otherwise every morning I use Altruist 50+ spf which is also super moisturising so I don't need my actual moisturiser. But even on cloudy days, if you're out, stay protected."

What I was getting at and couldn't find the words was creamy or milky cleansers. But others have mentioned oil cleansing which is great for dry skin. I'm not very good at explaining this, words are not my forte, but essentially it lifts away dirt and impurities without stripping your skin bare of the natural oils you produce. Theres also TONS of oils you can use. A lot of people have recommended almond oil so maybe look into that but maybe also have a look into hemp seed oil?

Hemp and cannibas have been branded massively for being soothing, calming and generally restorative for a reason. I'm not clear on the terms, but cannibas/hemp is so good for healing because it's so in tune with our bodies. There's some kind of synergy basically.

Or if you get a lot of sunlight in the morning, just have the blinds closed then and vice versa. Really hope I'm making sense lol

As for curtains, they don't need to be black out, just as long as they're keeping the sunshine out. I've since switched to light grey/off white ones which do the trick.

I've always heard oil cleansing is better for people with dry and dehydrated skin because they don't strip away too much oil. 

I know some of the attraction to oil cleansing is because it only strips away the excess oil but then if you're cleansing again after, it sort of negates the purpose because you're stripping away more oil and moisture. You spend a lot of money that way too. 

For me, it's great for make up, but otherwise unnecessary."
SkincareAddictionUK,foq4jjl,t3_g8xs4o,1587982743.0,"You've started out with the essentials and it really looks like you've done your research. However, double cleansing on oily skin is not a necessity. I have oily skin all over so I feel your struggle, but I've found my best results are from cleansing once a day, particularly in the evening if you're wearing sunscreen. You might find that breakout on your cheek was because your skin was irritated from all the washing. Imo, you only need the one cleanser. If you feel better cleansing twice a day, do that. 

A water-based cleanser is better for oily skin, so you're on the mark there. If you do prefer the micellar water though, make sure you're still rinsing your face after you've used it. Have a look into a salicylic acid serum that you can apply to your affected areas. I've had a lot of luck with the Boots one but there are tons you could try. 

Otherwise, your routine looks good. Sometimes it's a bit of trial and error with the products you use. It's taken me ages to find a moisturiser that doesn't turn my face into an oil slick or cleanser that doesn't strip me down to the bone."

And with the pandemic, while more people are being made jobless, unable to pay their rent and therefore homeless, the number of people on benefits has just sky rocketed which will make the renting market even more difficult. 

This is only based on the UK. You can share your stories about how great your landlord is but you're lucky, you're an exception. The truly good ones are few and far between.

Now I'm not going to say go and stop paying rent, especially if your landlord has kids and a family, we're all in a place of need right now and I'm not even sure if the government here has banned any evictions, so now isn't a perfect time for a rent strike.

SkincareAddictionUK,fltra4o,t3_fr4p7a,1585484587.0,"Their Salicylic Acid is great imo. The pump is awful but I can deal with it for better skin. My skin has been looking clearer, not to jinx myself, blackheads are gone. I still get the odd pustule and minor blackhead but that's more to do with having a treat once in a while."
SkincareAddictionUK,fls8bdq,t1_fls4wwt,1585436500.0,"The Granactive retinoid emulsion 2%. I got it from Boots last so should check their website, their delivery prices are just ridiculous when you look at sites like Beauty Bay. Beauty Bay are out of every retinol/retinoid as far as I can see. I've not had great experiences with Cult Beauty but may have to go with them if they have it too. 

I'll sit down tomorrow and do a proper search."

NoMansSkyTheGame,flnslhp,t1_flnpx2k,1585325078.0,"I've seen a bit of that from google. It makes total sense, I'd also rather my game loaded, didn't freeze and just worked but it just seems like another one of those things where they had such a great idea but didnt have the technology to make it work? 

I stopped playing for ages because of that bug in the Artemis quest line and have started a new game where there's all these new features  which I love, but I'm still coming across bugs from years ago. I know no game can be perfect but when they've put out all these updates, with few of those bugs, from my perspective, being fixed, it just feels disappointing. Especially when I spent 3 almost full days on a planet and now all my discoveries are gone...

Ugh, it is what it is."
NoMansSkyTheGame,flnp1j9,t1_flnlctl,1585323127.0,"Same here! Just positive notes I guess. 

It is a bit demoralising, like what's the point in it if you're just going to lose the progress?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,flnh61r,t1_flngtkc,1585318510.0,"At least you can get nanites and units from them still.. but, as I said, 3 days. And I'm sure people have spent so much longer on a planet as well."
neighborsfromhell,fllpmu4,t3_fpj8ih,1585265197.0,I wish my neighbours were happy.
britishproblems,fllox6h,t3_fplr8r,1585264795.0,None of my neighbours clapped. I only heard about it just minutes after otherwise I would have been the crazy sod leaning out her window clapping at the empty road.
MakeUpAddictionUK,flkedop,t3_fpdwop,1585239348.0,Make sure it's a cold wash or you'll melt the glue. I wouldn't do it personally but you do you.

MakeUpAddictionUK,flhy0ur,t3_fove6w,1585171633.0,"So this isn't entirely unheard of, it seems to be making the tiniest resurgence, but have you tried just using your hands or fingertips?"
NoMansSkyTheGame,flha513,t3_foqj20,1585158891.0,How?
britishproblems,flh9x69,t1_flg839u,1585158778.0,Same here. What's the need for it?
britishproblems,flh9oec,t1_flgbxt6,1585158650.0,That's so sweet!
britishproblems,flh9ipo,t1_flgmnxq,1585158569.0,"So are mine. They're coming and going all day, have people over all day. They're not taking it seriously."
britishproblems,flg72f3,t1_flg6z0v,1585133288.0,Me too. I resent everyone NOT enjoying their gardens.
