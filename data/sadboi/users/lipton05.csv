depression,ff90ita,t1_ff8zymw,1579701736.0,"I tried to end my life and it didnâ€™t work. I donâ€™t like thinking about it because the memory is seared into my mind. Itâ€™s not worth it ; things might be bad for a while but Iâ€™m still not recovered from that happening. I canâ€™t tell you what to do but speaking from experience  the attempt was worser than just having depression or any mental illness. Whenever things feel hopeless for me I usually spend time in my room praying to Jesus and telling him everything shitty thatâ€™s going on and I listen to music and remember the attempt. I donâ€™t know if you believe in Jesus but I know that Iâ€™ve told him some ugly stuff and the depression felt a bit lighter. Idk I care about people and it would be really sad to see you give up. The suicide hotline is also I place I vent to, and I just type anything. Last resort is a psychiatric ward. That actually was a very interesting time I had there after the attempt. It gave me some hope.. thatâ€™s really all I have to say"

depression,ff8z9f2,t3_esbfsf,1579700742.0,I think in life we have hopeless periods of time. And some are longer than others. For me Iâ€™ve have a lot of times where I wanted to stop living but I just wanted rest. I canâ€™t tell you what to do but youâ€™ll never know whaat your life will be like if you ended it now

depression,ff61618,t3_erntym,1579616483.0,Parents sometimes act weird when they canâ€™t figure you out. Especially since they gave birth to you. So try to ask her is she confused or is their something sheâ€™s upset about that made her say that because it hurt you when she said that.
depression,ff610kn,t3_erv1uh,1579616366.0,"Ok so everyday I look in the mirror and tell myself Iâ€™m beautiful even though I donâ€™t believe it. Iâ€™ll believe it one day. And my dad recently passed away so I miss his love and feel very deeply of him being gone. Maybe you can reach out to a counselor and explain your situation, Iâ€™m working with mine to talk about my dad. Itâ€™s really hard to know that heâ€™s not here anymore but one day Iâ€™ll understand why I have to keep going for him."

depression,ff5z1gg,t3_err22y,1579614793.0,My dog died too. She was the cutest puppy and sheâ€™s always curl up with me and sleep with me. She helped me through my depression. I had her since 8th grade and Iâ€™m 21 now. She was the best. Now when I think about her I try to focus on the good parts. She died in a pet hospital and had seizures but I know sheâ€™s in a happy heaven right now. Now I want another dog but we donâ€™t have the funds to get one. So now my depression is getting worse and I need to go back on meds and get a psychiatrist but I donâ€™t have funds for that neither.

DIY_eJuice,fcrt2sq,t3_eilv0l,1577906244.0,"Hi, Iâ€™ve been vaping for a few months and so far Iâ€™m really enjoying it. I use to smoke but everyone shunned me and I felt like a outsider so I turned to vaping .Iâ€™m currently using pods systems for more intense flavor, but Iâ€™m interested in getting an upgrade to a box mod. Iâ€™ve never had a box mod before but Iâ€™ve tried a few at my local vape shop and really enjoyed it! The pod systems I have is faulty because it doesnâ€™t charge all the way and itâ€™s small in my hand. When I get my first box mod I want something sleek and polished like these your offering. Iâ€™m currently saving money to buy a mod but the ones your offering look perfect for beginners like me. I really appreciate that you all give always systems like these because not everyone has the money to pay for them. Anyways yeah thatâ€™s my story. I plan to continue vaping for a while and Iâ€™m gonna build up my collection of vapes and tanks. Thanks ðŸ˜Š"
