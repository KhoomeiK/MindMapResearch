When I was 14, I was in a court case with a teacher. Long story short- I was mentally ill and called his phone a tad much.  Case went on for 9 months, eventually was told before I was charged with “malicious use of the telephone” that he was trying to get restitution for a class he failed in college.
I did not know him in college.

I got probation, the case was wiped from my record, I got clean and went to intensive therapy for a few years following/ AA."

Be your best self. Not you, but the best version of you. I fell in love with my boyfriend because there were things you’d never expect from him unless you talked to him. Got to know him. 

Dated a handful of people over the years, they weren’t nearly as interesting. 
Lonely isn’t fun- but it’s even worse when you have people around you who make you lonely. 

Find a solid group of people. Stick with them. Too many people are attractive and plain."

Trauma basically covers me living with my mom in houses and moving constantly, she drank herself to death in the end, but not without leaving some nasty scars on my brain. 

I can’t always blame her though ; she most likely had a BPD diagnoses (shitty family, too) and a husband who didn’t want to understand or deal with her.
 
Fast forward a couple years, I’ve been raped multiple times, I’ve been an alcoholic, shroomhead, pot head, self harm addict, blah blah blah

My dads a hoarder, my brother doesn’t try to understand or help, my dad likes to put problems away and deal with them when they are boiling over.

I’m sixteen, and I can’t remember anything beyond the last six years of my life. I knew I existed, I have the pictures, the videos, I just don’t remember any of it.

And the current memories and the last few years are blurred ; but more memorable. 

Anyways, I’m better at hiding it (until I pull my sleeves up 😭)
