Bright, indirect light is best but they can tolerate brighter conditions in the landscape. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer monthly.  
Use Fertile, well-drained soil.   Best in fertile, well-drained soil.   Be careful when handling your fern because it looks soft and fluffy but has occasional hidden thorns."
