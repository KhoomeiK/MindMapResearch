We will raise our kids with both religions"

ABCDesis,f94fhqh,t1_f941mn0,1575086608.0,It‚Äôs funny you said that because my fianc√©‚Äôs mom was like i don‚Äôt want him to convert to Hinduism but then they want me to convert
ABCDesis,f94fg3q,t1_f945rtu,1575086566.0,"Lol yeah but since my fianc√© is marthoma, his church won‚Äôt allow us to get married there unless i convert. Any advice ?"

ABCDesis,f93sl0e,t1_f93rzus,1575067412.0,do you think we'd be able to find a mallu church willing to marry us (hes a marthoma)
ABCDesis,f93sj8e,t1_f93rzus,1575067376.0,"he's been pretty supportive so far, his mom is just being like ""you have a choice, but i want my son to be married in our church"" lol"
ABCDesis,f93rrcm,t1_f93rmsm,1575066790.0,"that's probably why. Apparently in our culture, since im the girl marrying the guy, i have to take on his religion."
ABCDesis,f93qej2,t1_f93nwqz,1575065771.0,Yes I agree with you.
ABCDesis,f93q3es,t1_f93pcii,1575065536.0,"It doesn't bother him at all, because he really doesn't go to church much. His mom kind of tries to get him to come every sunday or so, but he resists most of the time. He isn't religious either, but he still believes in what he's been raised with. Some of his family were very judgmental towards me since I am a hindu, claiming that christianity has more structure (since hindus don't have a set day to go to the temple). I am not being forced to convert, but his mom is trying to make me feel guilty for not wanting to. It's stressful."
ABCDesis,f93pu37,t1_f93pot9,1575065339.0,"Oh wow. Nope, both of us are born and raised in America, so it will happen here."
ABCDesis,f93oxra,t1_f93onjm,1575064660.0,do you believe it would be easy to find a mallu church that would be willing to marry my fiance and i? he is a marthomite
ABCDesis,f93ogvj,t1_f93o3bg,1575064308.0,"He was brought up that way, so his parents I guess have an expectation that he will get married in their church."
ABCDesis,f93nmnb,t1_f93luqj,1575063684.0,"Yeah I definitely don't want to convert because I want to keep my hindu faith. Unfortunately my fiance's mother says she won't force me, but she wants her son to be married at their church, and she doesn't believe in a court marriage. I know I can't make everyone happy, but it's a big decision to change your religion. I know now that mallu churches are really strict, they won't even compromise. If my fiance and I get married without the church, his church said he will not be a member. I think that scares his mother."
ABCDesis,f93n84g,t1_f93m4r0,1575063383.0,fake convert so my future kids can be raised as christians? I think not.

ABCDesis,f93e2ah,t1_f93d9fy,1575056660.0,If you don't mind me asking are you malayalee? My fiance and I are malayalee and his denomination is very strict. They won't allow us to get married in his church unless i convert.
