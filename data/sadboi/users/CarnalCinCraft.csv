I think the shopping method depends on your location. I saw a person in a pickup truck drop mine off. I think the quality has been good but nothing extra special compared to the grocery store. It keeps me home and eating produce, so I like it."

I knew that would work well for me because if I feel like I‚Äôm doing just barely better than nothing, it‚Äôs not too daunting for me. Thanks for giving me a place to help with accountability."

vegancirclejerk,fown0cg,t3_g9q9rn,1588123007.0,This is kind of upsetting to me and seems manipulative. I am vegan and so are my kids. They are with me 50% and their dad and his gf the other half of the time. They feed my kids what they need while they are over there. I would never try to undermine his timeshare with them. Your hope that you will have her child more frequently due to diet feels manipulative.

I dumped green and yellow lentils in a big pot, added some water and then pur√©ed roasted veggies( broccoli, cauliflower, onions, kale, and whatever else needed to be cooked from the produce delivery box). Dumped the smooth veggies into the water and lentils and boiled for a while. Added more water as necessary till soft."

The kids and I went through every closet and drawer in their rooms and this weekend while I was alone I did all my dresser drawers. Every drawer now looks and feels as good as this one pictures."
