The neighbor said they'd seen another cat attacking him, and they'd seen him hanging out in their yard after, but his collar was gone so they didn't know he belonged to anyone or who to call.

He started purring as soon as I got him back to our house. He gulped down a bunch of water and seemed interested in the tuna and cat food, but he hasn't eaten any, just looks up at us and mews."

There's no body, so we think maybe someone took him in and decided to keep him.

It's just the not knowing that is tearing me apart inside. These last 4 days have been horrible. I can barely eat or sleep, and my stomach has been torn up and nauseous. I can't enjoy anything anymore."
