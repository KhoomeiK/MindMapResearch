The best thing I’ve done is used this rage at being me to work on myself. Thankfully, BPD is something you can work on and I use it to jumpstart things I want.

BPD,flysp0v,t3_frqhug,1585608327.0,"YES. 

I’m working on it right now (not super successfully), but the best thing I’ve done is tell my friends that I’m always afraid of it and to tell me if I can ever do anything better even if it’s small. Example: living with my best friend short term, and she told me where she likes her glasses put on the drying rack so now I know to do that. 

Another thing I do is just generally work on being a good human and the most authentic version of “myself” (whatever that means), and if someone I’m not close to doesn’t accept it, then I don’t want them in my life because they’re just going to get more demanding and I don’t need toxic relationships in my life."

I realized that wallowing on the little things would just cause more stuff to go wrong for me and put me in a negative headspace.

today I talked to my recent ex (together 4.5 years) who ended the conversation by telling me to go fuck myself. he was a FP for a long time and still is a little bit. my newer/stronger FP didn’t answer my text when I needed support. 

Usually all this would lead me to a mental breakdown. And I feel the anxiety, the abandonment problems, the splitting- all simmering.

EatingDisorders,fi24vl4,t1_fi233fm,1582071516.0,"I completely agree with this. Often eating disorders are associated with shame when you do eat, and it sounds like you’re not experiencing this - just a loss of appetite. People with eating disorders don’t always lose their hunger, they just see the benefits of not eating outweigh the benefits of eating. 

You should try to get some calorie dense foods, maybe granola bars? Or try drinking milk or smoothies- sometimes it’s easier to drink calories when you feel nauseous. 

I do definitely recommend getting help though if you’re not already! Depression is serious and your mental health is important. My PMs are open if you ever need anyone to talk to.

For me, I usually try to reach out to old friends and thank them for the impact they had on my life, at least once I’m happy and comfortable with my new friends. Often I get left on read because of how I treated them (happened yesterday, actually), but it provides me some form of closure."

socialskills,f0k5g81,t1_f0k4pmq,1568670780.0,"I definitely agree that groups help with inclusivity and social awkwardness. And that religion has problems (like my edit said, I’m not religious at all)

But also, religion literally has rules written down and made obvious. “When we take communion, we don’t talk” or something of the such. Whereas if you rock climb as a hobby, there’s no rules as to what to talk about while climbing or when you should or should not."
sex,f0juvvv,t1_f0juku2,1568663590.0,"The “attacked” part was hyperbole, but I did get several pms where people told me how DEGRADING it is to WOMEN (I.e. me, apparently?) when someone uses the word female instead of woman and that I should KNOW BETTER and BE BETTER."
BPD,f0fnkmn,t3_d4p96g,1568586273.0,"Thank you for being so open! 

If you ever want a friend that understands, I’m always happy to talk. 

I obviously can’t diagnose you with BPD, but I understand not being formally diagnosed. One therapist told me he didn’t want to diagnose me with BPD bc it would “ruin my life,” and another one said it was “too serious of a diagnosis” so I went a long time thinking I was just crazy. Even if you’re not formally diagnosed, joining this sub and talking to others and learning what you can has helped me immensely. 

You are valid and important, no matter what."
BPD,f0fmqhe,t3_d4qnci,1568585879.0,"Totally relatable. It’s almost more frustrating than the splitting. With splitting, at least I’m like “well I had to get my anger out or I’d self harm” but with the sexuality it’s just ruining relationships and causing so much harm"
AmItheAsshole,f0favr1,t3_d4lxcu,1568580577.0,"YTA. You did it out of anger without thinking about their perspective. 

That being said, I also am adopted and have birth defects. I understand all of the anger around the fact that they don’t want to talk to you or have any real conversation. 

However, you don’t necessarily know the situation around them giving you up for adoption.  Maybe they couldn’t afford a child. Maybe they literally just did not want one at that point - and this way you grew up with parents who wanted you. There is a chance they didn’t want a child with a birth defect, but you don’t know that for certain and you could have impacted their current family in a way you’ll never know."
trichotillomania,f0f6o2u,t3_d49s2w,1568578757.0,"Hi, welcome!

Of course I worry my hair won’t grow back, but then it does. I keep reminding myself that one day it might not, but for now it is and I always just have to wait it out. 

I don’t have any advice on helping it grow back faster, but I’m happy to talk if you ever want to talk to someone else about it. I don’t know anyone in my life who has trich either, I’m also 22F, and also about to move across the country for a grad program :)"
Trichsters,f0f623e,t3_d4fbu9,1568578492.0,"I completely understand the stress you’re feeling after pulling :( but you need you remember that not pulling is HARD. You are trying your best and you will be beautiful either way. 

I get it though - I’m currently telling my boyfriend NOT to propose bc I want to have real eyelashes when he does. I’ve been worried about that for going to friends weddings, and the anxiety must be so much higher since it’s yours. 

But honestly, worst case scenario, you use some fake eyelashes. People do that on their wedding day anyway. The most important thing to do is breathe, remember you have a fresh start right now, and that it’ll be okay. Stressing about what you did will only make you more likely to pull again. Spend some time practicing self-care and relaxation techniques. 💓"
AmItheAsshole,f094en8,t1_f08xk0m,1568493742.0,"I’m not sure about what her family was like, because I’ve only heard it from her side as her friend unfortunately :/ 

She told me all this one night when we were hanging out and drank a little too much (we work together rn) - she has since apologized for opening up so much, but I like to hear it and she’s glad she told someone. 

I agree that it’s not the most healthy friendship. I know her from a serving job and we don’t hang out too much outside of work but she literally asked me “an I the asshole in this situation?” So I had to bring up this sub"

sex,f07k1sp,t3_d3z6tv,1568463619.0,"I’ve always liked most kinds of freaky, but my SO was fairly new to sex in general and I didn’t want to push him to do anything kinky until he was ready. 

We were in college at the time and studied abroad in different countries. One of the first times we met up after a few months apart, we went to this awesome spa on top of a ski mountain. 

The setup was pretty open, and everyone could move freely between baths, showers, saunas, and hot tubs. We were in the outdoor hot tub as people were skiing by, and he kept moving closer to me until there was nowhere for my hand to go except on his dick. I used my hand and mouth to get him hard, and kept going for a bit. 

He wanted more, but I wasn’t about to let him cum in a hot tub used by a bunch of people so I said no. We then went back into a cold shower (i thought to help ourselves be less turned on) and he pushed me against the wall and fucked me hard, with the chance that at any point someone could come in during this freezing shower sex. 

This is the first time HE initiated anything kinky, and it was the start of some great times.

Edit: spelling"
