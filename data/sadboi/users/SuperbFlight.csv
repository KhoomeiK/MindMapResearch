I notice that when I am awake early (like right now) that I absolutely love it, but it is near impossible to go to bed early enough to stay awake for the whole day. I have been contemplating trying it to see if I might like an earlier sleep schedule but it seems incredibly difficult to go to bed early enough to still get the 9 hours sleep that I know I need (although maybe earlier sleep is more restful so I'd need fewer hours...). I do love the dew, the birds, my part of the earth slowly and gently waking up, the peace before the day starting in earnest. I might really try to get on this schedule soon!"

Even with my most recent former partner, I felt uncomfortable with nudity unless there was a sexual aspect to our interactions first! Going straight to nude without any sexual aspect felt really disconcerting and uncomfortable. I'm guessing because I am only used to nudity being a sexual thing so the unfamiliarity didn't feel good! I'm also wanting to see nudity more as just humans existing as our natural selves, just bodies! It definitely takes time and effort."

This is so well-written. I've really been struggling myself with feeling like I'm not worthy of existing unless I'm being a ""good"" person, which is often in the capitalistic sense of producing economically because I'm so sensitive to societal messaging. And my parents' love felt conditional on me behaving ""well"". I have been spending the past year trying to change that belief to the belief that all humans are worthy of existence because we are all marvels of the universe just by coming into existence and by being human. It is taking a while to change :) Words like yours help with this. If you have any more thoughts on this, I would love to hear, if you feel like sharing!"
emotionalneglect,fqtl67e,t1_fqsvymg,1589641145.0,"Ah yes! Hear hear, yes, that does feel like the way! I'm lucky enough to have had a therapist that modeled it before I truly realized what would help -- they were very knowledgable about CPTSD and said that they expect that mistrust is the default and that makes sense, and they would never tell me they were trustworthy, they would only try to earn my trust over and over again. That that's the true only way to be trustworthy. It really resonated and it helped me approach my own parts and inner child the same way. I have been able to feel them all relaxing more because they don't sense that I'm going to force them to be different, I'm going to just be here doing my best trying to honour them and earn their trust by acting in trustworthy ways. Because I love them and they are worthy of that care and love."

I feel similarly, I can see little me in memories and see her cowering in terror and sobbing with our cruel father standing over us yelling and shaming us... Feeling so unseen and *bad*. 

I try to spend time with her now to become worthy of her trust. I used to think I should forcefully offer her comfort because that's what she needs, but I soon realized that that perpetuated the abuse and neglect. I respect her wants and *listen* to her to try to understand her more, and offer things she approves of first. I feel so honoured whenever she feels safe enough to let me be around her and try to understand her. I will not give up on her, ever, because she is fundamentally lovable and deserves all the love and attunement and respect that she didn't get."
CPTSD,fqskjnb,t1_fqrxzah,1589609895.0,"I wish the shaming didn't happen! If that's your safe place then there's a very valid reason for it. I wish others could respect our experiences. 

It's been interesting to note that my safe place also involves no other humans around and with no way for them to reach me. What immediately comes to mind is being high up in a tree, with a one way mirror box surrounding me with so no one knows I'm there but I can see out and enjoy being in nature surrounded by animals, but I'm untouchable and completely safe. A deep fear of mine is someone invading my home and bedroom to harm me while I'm sleeping and vulnerable."

And yeah that was highly illegal on their part, that could definitely help your case if it goes through any type of system. 

I'll also add that I'm furious about how you were treated at the hospital, that they didn't believe you and didn't give you the care you needed. You deserve better."
COVID19_support,fqq0icc,t3_gk73f9,1589557296.0,"I wrote this in response to a comment that was just deleted that was giving advice in what I think was a very unhelpful way, so I'll just post it as a parent comment: 

While I think there could *possibly* be some merit to this advice, you're also talking to someone who is so severely depressed that they were worried they might actually hurt themselves. OP, I believe you deserve compassion and empathy before offering advice.

That all sounds like so much to go through at once! I'm so sorry to hear. Any one of those things would be rough to deal with. My heart goes out to you. I don't have advice, just want to offer that you are heard and I really hope things can get better for you soon. I believe that we all deserve to have a safe place to live and to be able to survive, despite the unfortunate reality of capitalism. 

Oh I would actually offer that while it sounds like it *would* be a challenge to live with roommates, I've found it can actually possibly be quite helpful for mental illness. Regularly interacting with people can be helpful. So that's a possibility! I'd suggest being careful and thorough in which people you choose to live with, if you can, to find a well-fitting place."

CPTSD,fqnrv56,t3_gjsqmu,1589500232.0,"Yeah I hear you. I hope that reading all the replies might help you feel not alone, not crazy, and accepted!

It's taken me years to find forms of meditation that actually work for me without being re-traumatizing. I've reframed it as mindfulness, myself, but it is key to pair it with compassionate acceptance. 

I usually sit and just notice what's going on for me. I actually ethically disagree with instructions to try to clear your mind -- I think that's actually extremely invalidating since the brain's purpose is to think. I've loved trauma-informed meditation that is about just noticing what's present, and reassuring that it's all okay, that it all makes sense. Because it all does! My racing thoughts make sense because that was a way to cope with a chronically-threatening environment, to stay ahead of a potential threat, and to anticipate how to keep myself okay. My difficulty in feeling parts of my body is because my body was abused so it didn't feel safe, and the part of me that kept bringing my attention away from it made sense.

It *all* makes sense. Every single part of me developed to keep me safe and well and okay. Approaching meditation with the goal of trying to notice what's going on and feel curious to learn more about all my internal goings-ons and body sensations has been the key. 

I **strongly** reject any meditation instruction that implies you *must* do specific things or you're doing it wrong, or that demonizes certain very human behaviors (like racing thoughts). Healing from trauma has involved learning to honor my autonomy, so now if someone suggests something during yoga or meditation and it feels bad or I just really don't want to do it, I don't, because respecting my needs in the moment is better than trying to achieve whatever the instructor is trying to get me to do. 

I hope there might have been something helpful in there!"
CPTSD,fqnqyha,t1_fqncw8z,1589499764.0,"UGH wtf is wrong with these counselors! Why can't they just accept where we're at and work with us from there instead of judging us for our coping strategies and what helps us actually feel safe. 

I have heard so many instances like this that I feel so furious about it. I wish there was an article about the harm that invalidating and judgmental counselors can do, that I can point people to when they feel terrible after therapy, like ""look this is why your experience was so terrible, it's NOT YOU, it's a failing of the COUNSELOR"".

If it helps, what's been helping me is making a point to talk to a friend or close one on the phone or in person (safely!) every. single. day. I always feel way better after I do. But it really does need to be every day or my brain starts to think that we're isolated and feels hopeless about getting the connection we need.

I would also offer that there's a lot to grieve right now, and grief that isn't allowed to be felt is very powerful and can keep you stuck. Feeling into the grief and offering myself compassion for what I'm going through has really helped me.

I don't think I've encountered that exactly, so I'm not sure if this would be helpful, but something I've found useful is to frame it in terms of what *you* need, not in terms of what *they* need to do. So maybe communication something like ""I'm sorry, I usually love chatting a lot but right now I'm noticing really needing some space to decompress"". Or something like that?

E.g. guys, ""man"" the booth, fishermen, workmen, dudes. I can't think of an example of a gender-neutral term that started female, which I think is because at the root, it's seen as a compliment for women to be compared to men, and an insult for men to be compared to women, and I think the cultural root of *that* is that female is inferior to male. 

I find that it's hard to not be reminded of all that when I hear guys as a gender-neutral term, especially since it comes on top of experiencing sexism in my everyday life. I do use it still because it's so common but I'm trying to switch to ""folks"", ""everyone"", etc."

I am *so, so, so, very sorry* that they failed you so completely. You had very normal and valid and healthy needs as a child and they failed to meet them. That failure is 100% on them. You did nothing wrong -- you were a normal child for needing your parents to be loving, and accepting, and supporting.

I want to be open that I'm scared in writing this because I don't want to say something that will push you further down that road you describe and I'm not sure how best to not do that. I just know that I want you to be alive because I sense such amazing human-ness in you. And I want you to have the chance to heal from the harm your parents inflicted to see the life that is possible after. And I feel such fury at how the people who were supposed to protect you and care for you betrayed their responsibility to you so horribly. 

I see you taking steps to heal and care for yourself! That is amazing. I believe we all have an inner healer that is fully capable of healing the trauma inflicted on us, if we are given enough resources and support. I sense that part is alive in you. 

And I also see the immense pain that you're in. I'm so sorry that that is present for you. I wish I could help more. 

I hope you can call the number for a hotline in your country: http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html . I am just an internet stranger but I want you to be on this earth and to have the chance to see what amazing life is possible. I know that may not feel possible right now, but what kept me going is knowing there was a *chance* to experience the vitality of life how I wanted to, a chance of the pain going away, in the only possible life I've been given in this universe. I want that for you. 

What has kept you alive so far? 

I also offer that you are not alone in your experiences (unfortunately). There is community to be found. I have found that r/CPTSD is a good sub for that for me (it's a bit more active than this one) and they have a sidebar with great resources.

It was initiated by him, but he didn't end it abruptly so we could work through it slowly and together ish, without it being a fireball catastrophe (like many of our past ones have been!).

He is such a wonderful human being. He is so gentle and kind, as well as being devoted to self growth, healing his trauma, and we have like complete sexual compatibility. 

But it's just hard. We trigger each other a lot. He rarely feels safe with me, which I mostly attribute to developmental trauma he suffered. The things that help him feel safe trigger me and vice versa. I prefer to connect by joking, having fun, being light-hearted, and interacting at a fairly fast pace. He prefers to connect by going really slow paced, literal communication (I think; it's hard for me to grok). I really have been missing light-hearted and fun connection with a partner while I've been with him.

We've both been in intense counseling and we're both growing and a healing a lot, but it just seems like he still doesn't feel comfortable around me very often, which feels really unsettling for me unfortunately then no one feels good. I've tried so hard to do what helps him feel safe and it's never enough. 

I love him dearly and he's such a wonderful person. Unlike others here, my gut tells me that we have amazing deep down compatibility, and I can 100% see us getting married and having kids, but then I think I'm overlooking a lot of the day to day interactions that are just okay or are actively negative.

I say this because I struggled with meditation for *years* because it was literally **agony** to just sit and be with my thoughts and sensations because there was so much trauma there.

Coronavirus,fmq9fod,t1_fmpkvan,1586295371.0,"I feel you. Digestive pain is *intense*. I'm very prone to minimizing any physical distress I'm in, but one time I got digestive pain so bad that I actually stopped being able to walk, and ended up hunched over laying down moaning, unable to think about anything except for the pain, and my partner was like I think that's pretty bad and you should call the nurse line. I said nah it's not that bad, but I did it, and the nurse said yeah that's definitely very bad and you should get it looked at. Apparently any pain that makes it impossible to walk is worth getting looked at?

It ended up starting to get better soon after so I didn't go but it motivated me to see a gastroenterologist. A colonoscopy found an adenoma polyp which was pre-cancerous, very rare for someone so young, so I'm really glad I went. Then got an official IBS diagnosis which has actually really helped take it more seriously.

As another tip for communicating about hard stuff, I suggest starting with something nice and compassionate, then sharing how you're feeling and what you're needing to be different, then another nice thing (the sandwich method). It can help reduce the punch of the ""negative"" feedback. 

Maybe like ""hey I really enjoy living with you for X reasons, thanks for being a good roommate in those ways! I'm noticing though that I'm really needing some more alone time. Would you be willing to do Y to help me be able to relax more in our home? I'd really appreciate it so I can continue to enjoy living with you!""

I never was allowed to just say what I wanted with my parents, it had to be justified, and we had to mind read the others' needs and wants, so that was my default and I definitely understand where it may come from.

GradSchool,fmgu27o,t1_fmgkj76,1586057838.0,"I agree with all of this!

I also think that your experience is extremely valid, and not uncommon unfortunately. A good supervisor should be able to accept what's going on without adding to it and be able to help you problem solve. If they react badly, that reflects on them being a crappy supervisor, not you being a bad student. I've heard a similar ish experience from so many grad students.

I would also add that one thing I do that really helps when I feel like my research is pointless or doesn't matter is to talk about it to someone who isn't deep into it. They usually see it as being interesting and for me very important for the world (due to my field).

ADHD,fmgtpni,t1_fmf0m4c,1586057572.0,"Yesss I've been so intrigued by this. I have always loved power dynamics involved in sexual activity and I've only recently actually come to think that a lot of it has to do with how it instantly ratchets up the intensity. 

I find non-power dynamics sexual activity still very physically enjoyable but not nearly as mentally enjoyable, and without feeling mentally engaged then it's overall not as enjoyable and I struggle to feel really present. 

But holy crap, my partner knows that if he does certain things, it's an **instant** massive response. It feels like my brain locks in on him and the sensations and my whole body comes *alive*. It also instantly sharpens the emotional connection between my partner and I where we become intensely attuned to each other. 

I also really like pain for similar reasons I think. It just makes my body sing (when it's not too intense and is worked up to appropriately). 

I actually think that sex is one of the top activities for making me feel *alive*. It's been extremely rare to find anything else that is that stimulating. Sky diving, roller coasters, and deep intellectual discussions would be up there as well

antiwork,fmetev3,t1_fmdvjw8,1586013101.0,"I agree with the other commentor! I believe that an ultra-capitalist society inevitably conditions us to always do the ""best"" or ""most efficient"" thing because that's what it's based on. 

It conditions us to ignore our in-the-moment emotions and wants. But those emotions and wants arise from our deepest values and goals in life. They're vital information on how to live a happy and fulfilled life. We're trained to ignore them because capitalism demands that we prioritize productivity as number one, and our deepest life values and goals are almost always completely *against* that. I think that humans tend to most value things like belonging, connecting with others, caring for others and ourselves, because we evolved as highly social creatures who *needed* those things to survive in groups. Capitalism goes against all of those evolved things and actually does the opposite: it puts us against each other and makes us feel highly individual. 

I wandered a bit. For me, trying to do the best or most efficient thing feels like it only comes from capitalism, not from any natural human tendency (unless it helps you survive better -- which now that I think about it, may also contribute somewhat?). Anyway I hope this was somewhat helpful :)"

I feel extreme concern that this therapist is even practicing and that anyone with PTSD is trying to be treated by her. She will do a lot of harm with her approach. I'd even suggest looking into reporting her somehow? But I have no idea how that works. I just feel really scared about how she's harming you and potentially so many others.

I've been working on this for a very long time so I can't describe all of what I've found helpful, but I think the *most* helpful approach has been realizing that my needs for attachment and unconditional love that I was looking to meet through relationships, were very valid natural childhood needs that were not met in childhood. In my case, I suffered a lot of emotional neglect and abuse and a dictator single parent who demanded obedience (the opposite of unconditional love...). 

I needed secure attachment from my caregiver(s), and they rejected many parts of me and often didn't meet my needs, so I went looking to fill those very real and valid needs of acceptance and belonging from romantic partners. 

Unfortunately, I've learned that it's not possible for other people to meet those needs. It's too much for another person. However, there is still a way to get them met!! I wholeheartedly believe that the only way to stop the co-dependency and anxious attachment, and to develop the ability to have secure attachment with a romantic partner, is to meet those unmet childhood needs **yourself**. 

You are with yourself all the time. If you've made it to adulthood, you have what I call a wise, mature, empathetic, caring adult part inside of you. And there are many parts that you adaptively disowned because they were not acceptable to your caregivers; a child depends on their caregivers for survival, so the threat of losing their approval and acceptance of you would have literally felt like threat of death. 

Those disowned parts are still there, desperately needing to feel acceptance and love. I strongly believe that it is possible to learn how to accept and love all of your parts. It's made easier because I've found that ALL of them act to protect me or to help me in some way. It may not always be immediately clear, but I've found it to be true in every case. 

It's often described as re-parenting your inner child. I find that phrase doesn't resonate with me a lot, and I prefer ""Meeting my childhood needs that were not met"". It's all very individual :)

That is my best advice I think. Oh and that this process would be helped a *lot* by a counselor who can truly accept all of your various parts. 

I'd be happy to offer more elaboration if that would be helpful :) And I can share that I am *finally* at the point in my life where I feel like I actually have the ability to securely attach to a partner, if that helps to offer hope :)"
science,fm6rfgh,t1_fm5v5gx,1585801161.0,"I actually think the solution (at least it has been for me) is to be caring towards the part of you that feels guilty, distressed, anxious, etc, and try to see what it's needing/wanting. 

Anxiety, for example, can actually be a really adaptive emotion, in that it motivates you to make a plan to prevent future bad things from happening. Any type of fear also tends to be expressed in the body as fight or flight (an adrenaline response), so to help give it what it needs, you can move the energy through and out of your body by running or walking quickly (simulating flight), and/or punching outwards or pushing against something like a wall (simulating fight). In fact, when you feel anxious or afraid, if you are able to tune into your body sensations, you'll often feel one of these impulses. 

I find guilt a bit trickier to work with. I try to turn towards the guilt feeling and see what the source is, and there's usually a belief driving it like ""I am disappointing my boss or team or colleague"", or often ""I am disappointing myself"". I then offer caring to that part of me, and try to understand it, since at the root of *those* beliefs are *values*; I value the approval or happiness or well-being of my boss, my colleague, my self, etc. Providing empathy to that part really helps it settle.

I find that if I turn *towards* these emotions and parts instead of ignoring them and pushing them down, and try to give them what they truly need, I tend to feel much more calm and settled after and my other values emerge to motivate me. Like wanting to get a good grade so I can have a high CGPA so I can get a good job so I can have financial security, a family, ease, etc. Or wanting my boss to approve of me so I have a better shot at a raise so I can have financial security, etc. Then if the thing I was procrastinating on is in line with my deep, underlying values and life desires, I tend to feel spontaneous motivation emerge to do the thing. 

I have found that ignoring/disowning and pushing my emotions and parts away, and just brute forcing myself to do things, may work for a little bit, but leads to a **lot** of unease and dissatisfaction with life. And it also stops working if you reach a certain threshold of stress. I now suggest to anyone struggling with a block of any kind to feel into and turn towards the parts of them that they've always disowned and ignored, and magic can happen."

- reduces strain on the health and emergency systems since financially-stable people use these services much less
- it could remove barriers to working that people who are stuck in poverty face, boosting economic output and taxes
- it should be simple for folks who earn above certain amounts (in income or capital gains) to pay back some or all of the UBI in their tax returns
- more people should be able to afford to upgrade their education/skills, leading to higher income
- [this study](https://www.google.com/amp/s/globalnews.ca/news/4149318/guaranteed-income-43-billion-a-year/amp/) found that UBI would only cost $43 billion/yr (in 2018)

I am sensing from your writing that you are maybe looking for him to agree with you that he should take on more responsibility? I've done that a lot in the past and I found it really helpful to realize that it doesn't matter if he agrees with me, I can still make requests and set boundaries regardless of what he believes, because that is my right.

I offer a suggestion of first validating yourself that it's very okay to want equal domestic work loads. Then when you go to him, you could say something like ""I know you might not agree with this, but I am noticing really needing more equal work loads around the house. That would look like X, Y, and Z. Would you be willing to help me with that?"" If he says he doesn't want to, that's ok! He's allowed to want whatever he wants too. Then I'd suggest a broken-record technique of just continuing to re-state what you want without getting drawn into arguing about if your want is valid. ""I hear that you don't want to. And at the same time this is something I'm really needing so I can feel relaxed and good about you living here. Would you be willing to do X, Y, and Z?"" 

You can keep repeating until he maybe gets that you won't be dissuaded from making that request. If he doesn't want to meet it, then I suggest thinking about what you want to do about that. If it were me, I might first just not do stuff. Like not walking his dogs, not washing his dishes (if you need dishes, you could keep a set separate that's only for you), not washing his clothes. That would be very fair. And I would suggest to keep making the requests. If he says no, ""Hmm interesting. So you're not wanting to meet my need for an equal home work load?"" And then he can't deny that's he not contributing. 

If he keeps turning it around on you, I would strongly suggest to reflect on if this is who you want as a life partner. I know *I* wouldn't, but you might be willing to accept that in a relationship if it's meeting other needs of yours."
