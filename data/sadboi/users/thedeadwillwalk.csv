iphone,fr4m8zn,t3_gmhdzp,1589892022.0,"Hey guys, long time iPhone user. I recently switched to an Android (I know...). I haven't had any issues other than the fact that my dad who is an iPhone user can't send me any texts. At first I thought this was an issue with it defaulting to iMessage with my old Apple ID, but I haven't had issues with any other iPhone user. I can't get any of his texts and when he tries to text me it tells him to ""use a valid 10-digit number."" I still have the same phone number and it's correct in his phone. I don't know if this is an iPhone issue, an Android issue, or a carrier issue. Thought I'd try here first. Thanks."

starbucks,fqpihqi,t1_fqo714v,1589547217.0,It has to be requested. We can't just assume the customer wants the recipe altered.
starbucks,fqpieho,t1_fqo06tf,1589547156.0,"Unless your manager is saying otherwise, it's subjective. If they specify what size cup of ice, you should get that, but otherwise it's up to you. Sometimes we've been low on certain sized cups and told people we couldn't spare the size they wanted for ice."
starbucks,fqpf5l2,t1_fqotasg,1589544780.0,"Yep. There's this one guy, and we use a whole bag, but he's nice about it so he gets a pass."
starbucks,fqnnkw1,t1_fqnmqjr,1589498095.0,Yeah. Unless you got syrup or cream. Cream isn't as much an issue because it's eyeballed but you might ask for an extra pump of sweeter if that's your game.
starbucks,fqnk0ec,t1_fqnjl8l,1589496232.0,"14 years ago when I started with Starbucks, no one got light ice. It's picking up in speed though, so maybe Starbucks will eventually come out with a specific standard, but it's like making a cake. You accidentally added a cup and a half of flour instead of one, so now you add an egg, and then a little more milk. It's never gonna return to the same taste as the normal recipe."

starbucks,fqmu05u,t1_fqmiszd,1589483506.0,"If you order the lemonade version, there's no water. But if you think it's too tart, I recommend asking for half the normal lemonade and the rest water. It would be 1/2 strawberry, 1/4 lemonade, 1/4 water."

starbucks,fqmt4ib,t1_fqms17a,1589483085.0,It's okay. I just wanted to make people aware of why their drink might taste different than when they order it normal.
starbucks,fqmlmiz,t1_fqmkzcp,1589479481.0,"Yeah, we have new updated standards for that."
starbucks,fqmgp1f,t1_fqme0kr,1589477155.0,"In the opposite case, we just add more ice."
starbucks,fqmcdxn,t1_fqmbtmy,1589475127.0,"Cream or milk topper of any kind is always eyeballed. Unfortunately we don't have a standard, and I'm guilty of not adding a lot because default that's the way I like it. It might be easier if we did have a standard."
starbucks,fqmc29u,t1_fqmahyj,1589474972.0,"Yeah, the vanilla in it is already half of what, say, a latte would be. 3 vs. 6. Maybe do 4-5, a little extra sweet cream if that concerns you."
starbucks,fqm8rx7,t1_fqm8nyb,1589473425.0,That's why they updated the way we ring it without changing the price. Hopefully it helps.
starbucks,fqm5tje,t1_fqm5kkv,1589472001.0,"Yeah, just say that you're you don't want extra milk and that you're okay with a little room. That should save time."

starbucks,fqm2aol,t1_fqm1ucx,1589470273.0,"Yes, to clarify, if you're adding NEW ingredients to the drink, then you're going to be charged, but if you want more of what's already in there, you don't have to pay. I try to do the same with stuff like that which used to have a specific like the black and whites. (I'm so old they used to call them tuxedos back in my day.)"
starbucks,fqm1si1,t1_fqm1n19,1589470021.0,"Yeah, another shot of espresso would cost extra, but the white mocha syrup is free. What size do you get?"
starbucks,fqlzo7i,t1_fqlzfa7,1589468966.0,"Ah. That makes more sense because they're not actually Starbucks. They're ""Target serves Starbucks,"" so they have their own way of doing things. They don't have the training core stores do and that might actually be their policy."
starbucks,fqlz6j4,t1_fqlyu1a,1589468719.0,"Yeah, every evening my store's all like, ""Trenta strawberry lemonade refresher with no ice, add peach juice, 5 pumps raspberry, 2 scoops vanilla bean powder, and extra strawberry pieces."""
starbucks,fqlyvqp,t1_fqlyo5k,1589468566.0,"Yes. I'm starting to worry from other comments that some baristas are slyly adding charges, but you definitely shouldn't have to pay any extra. Ask for a receipt if you think you're being overcharged."
starbucks,fqlwzuy,t1_fqlws83,1589467610.0,"That's currently against policy. Probably annoyed baristas, but I can't imagine what button they're pushing to add a charge."
starbucks,fqlwv3v,t1_fqlwp53,1589467544.0,"Haha, probably. If you're already paying for, say, soy, then extra soy shouldn't be charged. Probably those annoyed baristas that take it as a personal insult."
starbucks,fqlwicn,t1_fqlw14u,1589467360.0,"Definitely. Sometimes though I check just because you never know what the customer has in mind. Maybe they don't want extra drink, and they don't want it watered down. Maybe they're saving it for the morning and they don't want the ice to melt and are adding their own. So I usually ask specific questions."
starbucks,fqluwg4,t1_fqlue3p,1589466520.0,"Don't worry about it! People were doing it before TikTok,  but it exploded when people could feel like they were cheating the system. Like I said, if Starbucks were hurting financially in any way, this is probably the first thing they'd ""tax,"" but instead they just gave us more precise instructions for ringing them up without charging extra. Get your chai!"
