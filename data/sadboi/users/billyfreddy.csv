Quoted from reddit user 'AluCarD3939':

""yah, when i tried to convert the price, its true this guy want so much for this adapter.

here what i found about this adapter:

this is the model number for that adapter (CY-WIUCCAD-BK). also search with this number 4544859018978 and you will find a lot of results.

https://store.shopping.yahoo.co.jp/arc-online/4544859018978.html

the price in this link is 20$, but i don't know if they ship it outside of japan or not""

Here's the thread I made if you want to look at it https://www.reddit.com/r/miniSNESmods/comments/ae8xg7/diy_wired_usb_to_classic_possible/, he has some useful information, but what I quoted is the meat of it.

ps2,ffkkbhh,t3_etojg6,1580024186.0,"Popstarter works fine for me for many games. There are a few that don't work, but overall it's not that bad. I'm using an internal HDD though, over USB or SMB it might be a different story.

Get the latest OPL **daily build** from http://www.ps2-home.com, and use a program also found on that website, called PSXVCD to convert your PS1 ISOs to VCD, the format that Popstarter uses. This program will handle everything, you can just drag and drop archive files into it, it will combine discs that have multiple .bin files. 

You'll need a few files that are copyrighted by Sony, so they are not exactly legal to share. The files needed are:

POPS_IOX.PAK [Only needed for USB and SMB]

POPS.ELF [Only needed for HDD]

IOPRP252.IMG [Only needed for HDD]

I've only played with USB a couple of times, it's a little more complicated, but PSXVCD handles the creating of the folder structure and the .ELF file that boots the game. I believe SMB is similar.


https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/Home has a lot of information about the more technical things about Popstarter, like compatibility modes, which are needed for a lot of games. It's somewhat outdated but it's mostly accurate still. Cue2Pops is not needed, PSXVCD does the same thing but better. Look into the quickstart guide on this site for your chosen method of playing.

The version listed on the above website is not the latest version, the newest version is 'Beta 06 POPStarter_r13_WIP_07_OBT__20190605.7z'
and can be found at ps2-home.

This version of POPStarter may or may not be the best one to use. It's what I use but I don't play a huge amount of PS1 games on my PS2, haven't come across any problems that don't occur in older versions.

https://web.archive.org/web/20191108225505/https://assemblergames.com/threads/ps2-pops-stuff-popstarter.45347/ is the original POPStarter thread, tons of information here."
