I also follow a sleep schedule, got therapy, take vitamins, have a job that allows me a great deal of flexibility, and use a mood journal. Meds are an important part of my stability, but living with bipolar takes lifestyle changes as well.

I have diabetes and no intentions of ever going off of my Metformin either, even with diet, exercise, and weight loss.

As far as health concerns with meds, so far my organs are good, but I accept the risk. Unmedicated bipolar comes with a very high risk of suicide. I had two unsuccessful attempts myself. 

Also my quality of life is so much higher with meds. If I get 20 more quality years, instead of 30 miserable ones, or 5 more truly unbearable ones before killing myself, I'll take that trade."

It's not an easy road to stability, but it's so worth it! Meds are a lot of it, but there's also many lifestyle changes and therapies that can help. Just getting a good night's sleep was life changing for me after years of insomnia. If you're not getting regular sleep, please talk to your psychiatrist about that.

After 26 years of untreated illness, and three years of working towards stability, I was able to enroll in and complete nursing school with honors, something I never would have been able to do before. 

I'm so grateful that neither of my two suicide attempts were successful. My life isn't perfect, but depression is a dirty liar that had me convinced things would never change.

My youngest reminds me a lot of me as a child, and I worry about passing my bipolar on to her, but she has had a much more stable childhood than I had, and if she does develop it, she'll have two loving parents to help her learn how to manage it. 

My husband is my rock, and provides the kids with fun and stability. I provide the spontaneity and handle their emotional needs. I was surprised that they come to me instead of their dad with their problems, but dealing with my illness has given me a lot of practical suggestions, and a lot of empathy.

Yes, I've had some times when I wasn't as good if a parent due to mania/ hypomania and depression. But overall, I'm a good mom, and my children can rely on me. Especially now that I'm stable."

Luckily there are many men who own their preference for abundance. I've dated them, and married one special one. 

The first time I was naked in front of a partner, it was with a man who stopped what he was doing to come talk to me and ask me out. It took a lot of courage to say yes, and believe that this hot guy was into me. But we went out, and he was fun, charming, and flirty. He put effort into wooing me, and after a little while I decided to lose my virginity to him.

He wasn't the guy I wanted to spend my life with, but he was kind, considerate, and very turned on by me. The experience was awkward the first time, but got much better after that.

It took time for me to own my body and attractiveness, but it was one of the best risks I've taken. Being confident in my self attracted partners to me, and I never felt like I had to take what I could get, I chose to marry an attractive man who treats me like gold."

BipolarReddit,ffwo9lb,t3_evdmmp,1580306903.0,"I hate what bipolar took from me in the 26 years before I was diagnosed. It's not okay that so much of my life back then was wasted. So many opportunities were missed because my mania and depression wouldn't let me pursue them. 

That said, I've had a lot of therapy, and even though it took over three years to get stable on meds, I'm at a good place in my life. I don't want to spend the energy to hate myself anymore. 

Bipolar is an lifelong illness, like my diabetes, and like my diabetes it can be controlled with medication and strict adherence to lifestyle changes.

It turned into a tool to assess what felt right about myself and what didn't, so it wasn't a complete waste, but it wasn't accurate, except for what she already knew about me as my mother's friend and generalities that apply to most people. I don't think she was a con though, it was real to her."
BipolarReddit,ffuup0m,t3_ev9n8l,1580249686.0,"I was diagnosed with BP2, but it was an antipsychotic that stabilized me, even though I've never had a psychotic break. 

When it comes to Bipolar disorder I've learned not to get to hung up on labels, if something works, then it's worth it. I'm currently on an antipsychotic, a mood stabilizer, and an antidepressant. No major side effects other than one that comes from my being diabetic. And I have full emotions. 

Bipolar is a progressive disorder. You're young, and as bad as it is now, it will get worse without meds. I wasn't diagnosed until my late thirties because I never considered my hypomania to be a problem, so I only sought treatment for the depression. But as I aged the mania got worse, and the depression was crippling. 

It gets very old, starting and restarting your life, watching one opportunity after another slip through your fingers because you're not stable enough to hold onto them. 

Don't do that to yourself, take the meds. Keep trying different ones until you find what works for you. Be aggressive and push your psychiatrist for full emotions instead of just ""not suicidal."" It took me three and a half years to find the right combo,  but it's so worth it. Since then I've accomplished so much in my life."

My recommendation is to make a routine and stick with it everyday. If your children grow up with a routine, it will carry them and you when you're not in as good a headspace.

My children are well loved, and have a good mix of stability and spontaneity. My husband provides the structure, while I provide the vacations, outings, and social opportunities.

My oldest child has some issues with anxiety, but that is likely from her dad. Neither shows any signs yet of bipolar. But if that does happen, they will get early treatment and family support. Their experience of bipolar would be much better than mine."
