BPD,fr365vv,t1_fqzffkx,1589850736.0,"Mixed in with BPD so its hard sometimes to differentiate symptoms, but usually for me (of course everyone experiences it differently) i have slight delusions, like i'll think people are laughing at me and making fun of me when in reality its just paranoia, i feel like people watch me when i'm in public, etc. mild stuff. Hallucinations i usually get when i'm struggling mentally, they often last just a few moments to a few minutes. I would hear someone walking outside my window, so realistic, crunching of snow and everything, when i would look there would be no footprints (obviously). I have heard childrens laughter many times. During breakdowns i have seen black shadows enveloping me, seen scratches on my body that weren't actually there. Sometimes i'll even get train whistles when im nowhere near railroad tracks. Most prominent symptoms have to be the delusions though. Nothing like ""im going to be abducted by aliens"" or ""im getting secret messages"" but still very paranoid. Like soft Schizophrenia. Hope this helps!"

BPD,fqteyra,t3_gkq0j6,1589637653.0,"I think thee worst for me is the spiraling thoughts, they have always been very loud and negative. The voices that tell me im worthless, useless,etc, im fat and unlovable (im in a ltr of 10 months and these still affect me). I never get angry out loud. i can never express my frustrations because my thoughts are so fast that i can rarely get out one solid feeling or sentence. Procrastination gets me hard, i have AvPD as well so it makes doing things like taking a shower, making food,, doing laundry the hardest thing i can imagine and my clothes will sit dirty on the floor for weeks before i can get up and do it. Extreme sensitivity to crying, i'm not very vocal (something im working on) about what upsets me so if im already upset about something (usually very small and insignificant) i'll start getting anxious and frustrated, moody, and anything simple like my BF commenting on my moodiness can make me cry, HARD. And then the thoughts roll in faster than i can recognize that i'm about to spiral and BOOM. full breakdown. Another one is dissociating in the middle of conversations, or eating supper, just spacing out and not hearing anything that's being said two feet away from me. Just bugs me cause i feel like everyone will wonder wtf i'm doing and think im stupid. anyways, thanks for listening!"

BPD,fpvnhhl,t3_gfspey,1588948268.0,"I live in Canada so I don't know much about American insurance/ hospital stays, but when i was binging on stims & psychedelics in university i had to admit myself to the psych ward, this was before diagnoses of BPD and other personality disorders, but i knew something was wrong with my head. I highly reccommend it. you are in a neutral environment, and obviously forced to be sober. they will give you medication to deal with withdrawals & the mood swings that come with. You will be able to speak to psychiatrists, psychologists, and make a plan on how to change your habits. It changed my life. I haven't touched hard drugs in over 2 years basically, with exception to maybe once a year for a special occasion. I don't miss them, and i'm able to apreciate life as a sober person now. A lot of the shittiness you think life is, is more than likely due to being high and experiencing such calamity, and then the comedowns, etc.   
Obviously i'm no expert on mental health and still have lots of struggles day to day with it but it is not so amplified anymore. Truly, seeing a doctor helped me fix my bad habits and set me on the right path to getting better."

This has upped my monthly profit by about 100,000 G. I was only doing starwberry wine before i set this up. I also loooooove growing wheat, its so fricking cheap and it gives you hay to feed your animals along with mass amounts of beer.

MMFB,fppxejx,t3_geiqj0,1588811014.0,"Hey there. I saw your post history. I used to be in your bf's place. My mom would take my phone constantly when i was a teen because i used to c\*t too, she didn't like that i could talk to my girlfriend (homophobic) and would punish me for it by invading my privacy and denying contact with her for weeks, sometimes months at a time. Obviously during that time i couldn't talk to my other close friends either and c\*tting got worse and worse and i dug myself deeper into depression. I'm not trying to tell you my life story or anything but i really want you to know that you are not alone. And yes, it does feel like absolute crap when you can't talk to the people that support you the most, and you feel like the pain is the only peace and escape you can find from sadness but please, please understand that it will not help. I thought it was the only thing keeping me sane when it was actually the thing driving me closer to su\*cide.   
I'm turing 21 soon and the scars are still very visible on my legs, arms, stomach, you name it. While i'm not ashamed, I do not beilieve that these are markings that make me 'feel stronger' or prove that i am 'better now'. It reminds me of the crazy strong and engulfing feelings i used to have, and still have today. Your feelings are real, your struggle is valid even if you are young.

 Try reaching out to your friends, even if they haven't reached out to you. It may save you one night of feeling that urge, save you one more scar. I LOVE YOU. i don't know you, but i feel for you, and I hope you get through this. hugs, please be safe."

That being said, the only time i was diagnosed was when i was admitted to a psych ward, and even then my psychologist was frustrated cause i couldn't open up about anything.

Best advice would be to seek out a psychiatrist. Lots of personality disorder testing (if not all) are done through survey-like questionnaires; my testing was done on a computer, alone, in a closed room as to not have human interference or distraction. Not sure about protocal outside of a hospital but it was very simple & had direct answers to my confusion about my mental health. Don't be too scared! You can do it :)

I have an ex like this and after being seperated for almost 2 years now i have come to understand she was abusing me, emotionally and verbally.

I experienced a lot of hearing thoughts, like if someone was about to say something about a song or suggest we go stop at starbucks or something, i would have a thought about said thing just before they mentioned it. Also lots of nights in UNI where we would go to parties and a group of friends would all be in the same room and i could physically feel what they were feeling. EX: anxious, i would feel very tight in the chest, and i was fine, i was just hanging out, having a good time (or at least trying to) but if i made eye contact or focus in on them i would start feeling what they were feeling.

As a result of this and sexual abuse as a child i became a drug addict at around 17 years old. Around this time my mother would steal my phone and break my trust, invade my privacy and if she found anything she thought was concerning (me talking to girls ((im gay)), talking about being depressed to friends or talking about suicide) she would call my father over and he would choke me, hold me against walls, threaten to punch me,etc. 

 Not just saying this for attention, but i want you to know you are not alone.
