She checks my levels just the right amount to not drive me crazy but also get accurate reads on how lithium is doing in my body. Overall I’m happy. She’s a smart woman who I respect and I’m grateful she is in charge of regulating my moods. I’ve been able to hold a good job, graduate with my masters, and now buy a house all under her eye.

AskReddit,fkcpjg3,t3_fhjetv,1584058211.0,"I normally bulk up on stuff. I buy hand soap twice a year, I buy shampoo in bulk on amazon, I buy 3 25 bags of pet food, 6 containers of broth, huge containers of laundry detergent, 6 month supply of cat litter, and 6 months supply of paper goods. I do this because I’m disabled and because the subscriptions I use tell me when it’s a good price I use camel camel to get the best price on cat food and broth. It’s just easier to order these things in bulk and it’s better on my monthly budget. It also makes less deliveries and less times I have to ask someone to pick them up at the office. It makes me more independent by ordering only twice a year on shipt for instance instead of ordering Aldi and shipt once a month. Shipt is my paper goods /cat litter so if I only use them twice I can spend less per buy because every time you buy you get surcharges. Plus you can cancel your membership and get a partial refund. Aldi doesn’t have good paper goods or cat litter through there app instacart. TDR: it’s less trips therefore savings to buy in bulk when you are disabled and it’s less asking of favors to pickup at office."

bipolar,fivyhxp,t1_fivydr3,1582770929.0,I feel for you! This is so much! But she shouldn’t be able to harass you anymore. Good luck!
bipolar,fivy72x,t1_fivy1x6,1582770734.0,Do you have a friend lawyer? Or a non profit law help near you? Maybe even ask a lawyer subreddit to see if you have a case.
bipolar,fivsv8e,t3_fa3sy2,1582767308.0,Can you move again? Move states away. This sounds hellish. I wouldn’t put up with it. I think I would get a lawyer and file a restraining order.
bipolar,fivjs2l,t3_fa2q0n,1582761695.0,I disclosed. It’s a corporate environment I think it’s pretty safe.
bipolar,fivjnqt,t3_fa2qyy,1582761624.0,Just suggest that she see a therapist is the only thing I can think of. Without someone harming themselves or others you can’t really force them to get treatment.
bipolar,fivgrz6,t3_fa27q4,1582760016.0,Not every bipolar person experiences the same thing. I don’t have any hyper sexuality but I do have hyper productivity. Every person is different. Plus when I’m manic I’m not totally gone I don’t get violent or physical for instance. So it stands to reason you won’t cheat if you don’t normally. When I’m psychotic manic I just start thinking magically and connecting the dots when there are none. I just get completely irrational. Not saying that will happen to you but all the things I described don’t revolve around cheating.
bipolar,fivds6m,t3_fa1x9a,1582758536.0,Suicide is the act of escaping. You want everything to stop and leave. Are there things you can do to make your life worthy of not leaving? Maybe suggest to your parents instead of a non suicide contract you make a vision board for yourself instead.
bipolar,fiv4m20,t3_f9swpm,1582753719.0,Working from home today. I have a high 96% in my ethics class. Last night I went to support group. Today I don’t have much to do so feeling good about that.
bipolar,fiv0mx0,t3_fa0a0r,1582751665.0,"No, it’s a generalization made by someone in the medical field who should have been trained not to do that. I’ve been told I’m easy to manipulate, people just have to use guilt on me apparently. I tend to fend for myself and really try not to depend on others. I’m a single female with a cat. I pay my own bills. I work and go to school and do all my own work. I’m independent as f. In today’s environment everything is monetized. So I pay for a house cleaner, and food to be delivered. That’s not using someone that’s paying for a service."
bipolar,fiuze1a,t1_fiuz3wf,1582751010.0,Maybe ask your dr if kidney issues would show up on a test or not. Maybe she can add a test that check for kidneys.
bipolar,fiuyz3h,t1_fiuyusd,1582750795.0,My dr checks my lithium levels on the regular to make sure it’s not toxic.
bipolar,fiuyqqs,t3_f9zyso,1582750677.0,My morning dosage of 600 lithium sometimes happens in the afternoon if I forget it. I usually take it as a win if I take the meds that day. But I’m not a dr I don’t know if the time of day matters. I do know drs want you to take them around the same time every day. I take 900 lithium at night and don’t notice any side effects.
bipolar,fiuwq6h,t3_f9zozt,1582749660.0,"It’s always nice to hear you are doing a good job. This illness is tough to deal with, surviving every day is hard let alone thriving."
bipolar,fiuv4w3,t3_f9xuya,1582748834.0,Wow! That’s impressive!
bipolar,fiut979,t3_f9xd1e,1582747847.0,"No cheat code, just do each assignment at a time. Once you sit down and start it’s easy to finish."
bipolar,fiuij9o,t1_fiui9m2,1582742058.0,For me it’s like a timer without meds. A timer to my next psychosis. When I take my meds the timer stops. It took two years for me to experience it.
