You being outside, interacting with people and being in large groups is giving the virus a chance to spread. If too many people are doing, people will get infected and you'll have the same number's as in the before mentioned countries. So the people that are at home are actually helping your hospitals to not get overcrowded and keeping the mortality rate low, that's why the people in the image can do stupid shit like that. Because they're a minority, on the lower side of the inteligence meter.

If i understood him correctly he also expects the virus to be with us for the next year or two, we'll just have to recognize a spike and be prepared. I also agree with him on that.

I can't even phantom how the economy will react. Goverments are already sending out injections, but how long can they do that and how long will they have to do that. There's also work from home! So some people can work, i wonder how that affects the economy. 

I'm scared as fuck, I'm scared of getting the virus, I'm scared of food supplies, I'm scared of the economy. Could that be the actuall fall of society, so worse than 2008. Where there actually won't be any security net. My mental state is broken, even tho i limit my intake of media, I still think about it.

Tinder,fgvhsbr,t3_f0na56,1581149175.0,"I guess Tinder is absolute trash, in my in and off 2 year use, I didnt get Jack shit.

But in my honest opinion it's the only humane way to do 'meeting' people. The going up to a person that you find attractive and asking the person out is whack. You don't know if they're taken, you don't know if you are attractive to them and you don't know the reaction. I get it has been done for 100s of years but i feel like it's degreding. 

One way is to first know the person (school, work, other activities). In my experience That didn't work that great either, being in software development for middle school and college, there were zero or a few girls around, so that didn't bear any fruit. 
I didn't go out with anybody, while being drunk and partying for a few years.

Oh and ofcourse no girl ever asked me out, it could be i'm not that attractive (reasonable) and a bit the social norms.


So basically that's why I like the idea of tinder. I just want ed to vent a bit i guess."
