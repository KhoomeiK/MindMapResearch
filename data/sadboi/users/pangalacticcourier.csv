You come to the understanding that she is not well. She can't take any type of criticism or even have a discussion about her actions without you being the problem. You can beg her to go to therapy. You can use logic until the asteroid hits. You can provide examples and documentation of her past actions. Nothing will penetrate. Nothing will make her comprehend are actions have been unhelpful at best, but more accurately, negative. 

When you've had enough exposure to this negativity and manipulative lying, cutting the cord will be easy. Think of how long you've dealt with her unreasonableness. Think of how much energy you've spent doing damage control over the years to keep her from erupting. Think of how many hours of your life you've burned worrying about what her next reaction will be.

There is hope, however.

JUSTNOMIL,fphfcgi,t3_gdf6pa,1588620285.0,"That she is enabling this type of behavior is seriously disturbing. That this boy is behaving like this is also seriously disturbing. You have done nothing wrong, and you should continue to call the family out on this. Nothing in this home will change for the better on its own. I hope you can remove yourself from this living situation as soon as possible. Good luck."
JUSTNOMIL,fphex07,t3_gdcw4w,1588620069.0,"Clearly, your MIL is living vicariously through you so she can enjoy some kind of do-over of her childbearing years. This is the reason she is being completely insane. No normal human pressures a pregnant woman as to which doctors she chooses. Does she really expect to be present for private discussions with a doctor regarding your health issues? Unfortunately for her, that's not how reality works, or HIPPA, for that matter.

You are worrying for nothing. You are in complete control here. Your MIL can make all the suggestions—and even demands—she wants, but this is your pregnancy, your child, your marriage, and your decision is the final word on everything. If she doesn't like it, she's going to be sulking alone for a long time.

Firmly state your choices whenever she pipes up with her manipulative nonsense. Let her wait by the phone. Let her suggest whatever she wants, then inform her of how it's going to be. Pay careful attention to how strongly your husband responds to your needs and wishes. If he doesn't shut her bullshit down and present a unified front in your marriage, you have larger issues to address than your MIL. Wishing you a safe and easy delivery. Good luck."

The only thing to do is lock this shit down fast. No passes, no excuses. There's a fucking pandemic happening, and it won't go away soon. If your husband doesn't understand, suggest he move in with her. Maybe he won't mind being exposed to the virus via her workplace. Let him think about that.

You could always call the place she works as an RN and explain she is taking unnecessary risks with family safety, etc. She is also risking bringing the virus to her workplace. Astounding."

He should call CPS. He already has social anxiety. Continued living with his woman will not help him. Clearly she will not suddenly begin ""good behavior"" as you call it. Every day he lives with her, she is doing damage to him that will only cause him difficulties later in life. Living almost anywhere is better than living with her continued abuse. Good luck."
