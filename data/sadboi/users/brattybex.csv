sellingnudes,foe1exu,t3_g6zsql,1587694146.0,He scammed me with a different name on kik. Tried to tell me he was 17 and he was going to go to the police because I sent him a teaser photo. Stay away from anyone with that photo since he seems to change his name.

stopdrinking,euek6jb,t1_euehm1p,1563746402.0,I definitely have picked up puzzling but have yet to try reading before bed so Iâ€™m gonna try that!! Thank you for the advice :-) and yes letâ€™s do this together!!!
stopdrinking,euee8ug,t1_euedzlh,1563742181.0,Melatonin has been a huge help. Learn from my mistake though and only take the recommended dosage. I kept taking more and more since itâ€™s natural and I figured if Iâ€™m not asleep yet then I need more but trust me the dreams are vivid and very crazy for me when I take too much
dui,eued3w2,t3_cfw3q1,1563741369.0,The calculator isnâ€™t exact so thatâ€™s just an estimate. Also an 8% will leave your percentage pretty high. Only time will eliminate alcohol from your system and it seems that you didnâ€™t wait the proper time before getting into your car and driving especially into a ditch. Youâ€™re gonna need to lawyer up and prepare for the consequences. Youâ€™re underage as well so your license will be gone for awhile sadly
dui,etkjt1o,t1_etdpnt4,1562899884.0,Helping you not go to jail??? So you arenâ€™t stuck with a dui on your record for the rest of your life??? There is a lot of things that your lawyer does for you and your case

dui,er9fuyc,t3_c0qx5w,1560623198.0,"Iâ€™m not exactly sure. I have stuck with the same person because going to many different people just seemed tedious. There are many intoxalock installers in every state far and wide, Iâ€™m sure you can find one close to you and become pals since youâ€™ll be going to them often."
dui,er97ym0,t1_er96q9j,1560618908.0,"I just set a reminder in my calendar that I have to get it done before the next 30 days are up. I usually get an email reminder as well from intoxalock. Yes it will drain your battery if you donâ€™t drive your car so that would be a bit tricky. Thatâ€™s usually peoples first thought, Iâ€™ll install it and not drive for that period of time but then there goes your car battery."
dui,er93j7y,t1_er93e9f,1560616587.0,Huh thatâ€™s strange. Well I live in Florida. Not sure if that state matters but mine are every 30 days.
dui,er8q4ml,t1_er8nnk0,1560609630.0,No. Where you get it installed is where you bring it back to once a month now and it usually takes around 10 minutes for them to calibrate it and itâ€™s  30 dollars every time
dui,er8ly49,t3_c0qx5w,1560607299.0,I have intoxalock for about 2 months now. No lockouts. No problems whatsoever. Itâ€™s very easy to use and get used to. Just have to take it back to the guy who installed it once a month for calibration. Iâ€™m happy with my choice
