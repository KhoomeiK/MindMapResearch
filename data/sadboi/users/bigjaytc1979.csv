Alot of it could be cognitive distortions.  Your mind could be telling you things which are not objectively true. For example

""No one loves me""
Not true. Your children adore you and always will

""I am worthless""
Not true! We all have value and worth to those we show love, compassion, and empathy.

""I would be better off dead""
NOT TRUE.  If you have children, killing yourself would scar them more then anything. Life is hard. Death is the easy way out and would FUCK them up for life üò•"
