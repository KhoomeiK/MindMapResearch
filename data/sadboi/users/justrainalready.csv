dogs,fqzi4w0,t3_glk8c6,1589767877.0,What a beautiful pup! It took my rescue chihuahua 3 months to warm up to me. I was so worried he was unhappy or I was doing something wrong and then one day it just happened. Five years later he never leaves my side!

bartenders,fqkdh14,t3_gj9xhb,1589425022.0,I‚Äôm really nervous for the first time in 4 years behind the bar. I‚Äôm trying not to jump to any conclusions and see what happens with my job (luckily I am still employed but we are not open yet). I think it would be naive not to start working out a plan B and/or Plan C.

When I was up to 15-20 I found myself getting irritated, not feeling the effects long enough, and just overall not enjoying jt like I used to. Less is definitely more with Kratom!"

I‚Äôm so sorry you are going through this. Good luck."

Mixology,fku5qbs,t3_fkh7j2,1584542826.0,"SelvaRey makes some delicious rums. My bar just started carrying the cocoa dark rum and coco white rum and they have been awesome to play with. They go well in mixed drinks and even good enough to just sip on the rocks (and I‚Äôve NEVER been a Rum drinker).

Real McCoy 3 year aged Silver rum is also really smooth for its price point."

Anxietyhelp,fi092ta,t3_f5mlka,1582030667.0,"I lost many jobs in my twenties due to anxiety and panic attacks. I would rebound and get another interview only to have a complete melt down before going in for the interview. I would then drive home and cry all day. I‚Äôm in my thirties now and have been able to carry full time employment for about seven years. One thing I‚Äôve learned is to communicate my anxiety with my employer when I feel I am suffering. I am happy to say most decent employers will support you and/or help you. 

Best of luck to you!"

datingoverthirty,eu4m0vt,t1_eu4iacm,1563457694.0,I disagree. Recently went on a date to a baseball game and he lived very close to the stadium. After the game most places around were closed so I agreed to go to his place for a drink and to talk a little more. I had been clear I wasn‚Äôt rushing into hooking up and he completely respected it. We talked for 2 hours on his balcony and he eventually called an Uber for me after one small pop kiss. He was very respectful and I had a great time. Not all guys are horrible.
