morbidquestions,femcrlz,t1_fembxgk,1579248915.0,"Usually I just think about how much anger and hatred I’m bottling up. One can only inflict so much pain onto themselves until they need to see everyone around them miserable as well. 

I want to feel power, control, or dominance. Sometimes I think about going for the most vulnerable targets, like small women or children. It’s easy to overpower, it’s easy to gain control over every aspect of that scenario. Other times I think about going for a man, someone who will fight back, and *lose*. I’m taking control of the situation and I’m also asserting my dominance. The type of person I think about killing varies depending on my mood and environment at the time. 

I try to reassure myself that I like my freedoms and getting raw dogged in my jail cell for murdering a child isn’t the lifestyle for me. I like to be a free man, I like to have control over my life. I know if i acted upon those desires, sloppily at that, I would *not* be walking the streets. 

I’ve mentioned my desires to my current girlfriend and she seems to be on board with everything. I’ve had a bit of a low bar on the things we practice though. Often I have to stop engaging in all sexual activity in fear of going too far and not being able to go back. I like inflicting pain and I also like receiving to an extent. When she gives me permission and control, I don’t truly feel like Im in control. It doesn’t quite feel as authentic as some of the videos you’d find of real snuff or abuse porn. Honestly, you can subtract the sexual aspect of my desire and I’d get off on the gore alone. I find myself on bestgore or tor sites to see real life torture and not anything rehearsed."
morbidquestions,fembe73,t1_femaag0,1579247132.0,"your questions are just fine, I don’t mind answering not one bit.

I’ve tried various methods of coping with the hand I’ve been dealt. standard therapy, exercise, new diets, new environments, more “positive” alternatives to what I’m doing now.  It’s hard to cope with an experience you’ve *never experienced before*, it’s a bit out of the element for most people. The apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree.

I would kill someone, no doubt about it. I would do it in a heartbeat. It’s all I think about every single second of the day. It’s very hard to stop the compulsion sometimes but I stop it nonetheless. I watch plenty of porn. Porn of all assortments. I am also very sexually active. You merge the two and you’ve got a little sadistic guroporn baby. 

My desire stems from my urges to want to physically harm and dominate someone AND from early exposure to some fucked up stuff. I know that you can’t just steal someone off the street (well i mean...you *can* but that is frowned upon in many functioning societies), murder them, and then finish on their face. It’s something you have to keep under wraps whether you’re comfortable with your desires or not. That’s not icebreaker material.

Personally, I’m ok with what I’m into. It doesn’t make me uncomfortable, I dont wish I was into something else. I always feel like I can fall back on gore, porn, murder, etc etc etc. I’ve tried to squash it down but no matter how hard I try, it always comes back. Why try to hide myself from myself?? What I think and feel is just the natural order of being a human with individuality."
morbidquestions,fem9wd5,t3_epx003,1579245250.0,"im into it. *all of it*.

ive always had a morbid curiosity, even as a very young child. the curiosity turned into arousal once I started to reach that maturity. 

for me, early childhood trauma and neglect forced me into corners that felt relatable, something close to the suffering I was enduring. gore sites, hardcore porn, taboo, all of it made me feel half decent about myself. I had some sort of *real* connection, but to the suffering of others.

fast forward and im neck deep in all of it. nowadays, it’s for arousal yes but also to keep my intrusive, obsessive thoughts in line. *any way to cope, right?*

perhaps luka had a contact from his escort days that suggested snuff for profit?? lukas mom said he was making an awful lot of money from the escort business so maybe he upped the stakes so he could up the income. a lot of his clients were interested in darker fantasies so maybe he got roped in too. i honestly don’t see how he’d have time to manage the kidnapping, murder, cleanup, video/editing, mailing the parts, AND escaping to Paris in such a short time frame. who knows??? maybe his mom was the right hand man."
