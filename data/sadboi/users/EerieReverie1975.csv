TrueChristian,fpizrkl,t3_gdf5xi,1588652718.0,"Thank you for creating this thread. I just recently became Christian maybe a few - 4weeks ago so my ""faith walk"" is seemingly discouraging sometimes but I been self reflecting alot and trying to figure out what I need to break away from to help ease my walk w God. I need to break away from all things w/in the new age movement, depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and also just need help to overcome voices in my head that will make me want to retract from faith in God."
TooAfraidToAsk,fpiv745,t3_gdmizk,1588649479.0,"This is exactly why I text ppl instead of making phone calls. I feel like my personality changes a bit bc when I txt I don't have the nerves that are suppressing my personality, but to talk in person or over the phone to anyone sometimes freaks me out (although I try to seem clam n collected on the outside)."

BtsMemes,fp7gd1v,t3_g90le2,1588370112.0,"""Yeah we new, and what about it?"" Lmao I'm still trying to navigate my way through Reddit (as I'm not on here much, but have bn using this as a replacement for Instagram)."
introvert,fp7deu4,t3_gbf222,1588368537.0,Lmao I laughed so hard. This is so me. I use to work as a cashier and there was times when the store front had really slow says and my boss would mention how much money she was losing (and I did feel bad but at the same time I was happy bc I did have to fake a likeable personality and act like a social butterfly).
acne,faq01wv,t1_faogkpa,1576295874.0,Cn u message me ur routine. Would be so gratefulüò≥üôè

Anxiety,f7mc4rn,t3_dwy9m9,1573859349.0,"God this person has some nerve running back to report everything as though their his private investigator. People like that are such an annoyance to me. Its Not your business to tell. . . Like let me tell it of it needs to be told, god! I feel you on the paranoia-- for someone to go and speak your truth is itching at me. I'm always careful and intentional w my wording and tone when I speak BC I get paraniod that I'll be misconceived. That's one of my fears when it comes to anxiety. Maybe even to most PPL BC we all just want to be undrstood I think. 

Hope you able to find and feel relief when it comes to easing up on n dealing w the social climate in the workplace whenever u have to go in now."
confessions,f7m6op8,t1_f7l8h1q,1573855755.0,"When your trying to keep every single bit of independence you yourself can utilize-- then someone else unconsciously takes that away from you. Degrading man. People still have alot to learn when it comes to interacting w other's. I myself can't even imagine ""grabbing someones cane!?""-- your security is now in someone else hands. I can't. Even though thr intentions of PPL like this are harmless-- its sad that you and others have to face these damaging effects of people insensitiveness and ignorance. & pleaee don't feel bad about yelling at the guy. I'm sure he has been enlightened to a new form of social behavior that he wouldve never thought to consider otherwise"
Anxiety,f1j3w7u,t3_d9el7p,1569518395.0,Lmao I purposely chose a job I knew I wouldn't run into many PPL at. But if I could id move to another state or even country where the social pressures and expections aren't hovering me. It would be like a new start to life. . . Being reborn or something LOL. I fantasize about all the time.
depression,f1j273x,t1_f1ic17p,1569517767.0,"Yo I hate PPL w tht mindset. I always say--""what's easy for one person is another persons struggle"". We all have different personal development paces and experience. You CNT just write off or deny someones own individual struggle. Some PPL are ignorant to the idea of depression."
Assistance,f0w55dn,t3_d6jqpt,1568999214.0,"Im so happy for you. Glad there's genuine good-- selfless people in the world that want to give others a hand. That alone makes me emotional esp BC its a stranger. Everyone in society is usually just so ""cold"" Towards eacth other ( ESP on a day to day basis)-- when ur passively put into indirect social situations. No one sees any one anymore . . .(seemingly). We've become so caught up or drowned into our on routine and problems that were either blind, and or desensitized to the  experiences other PPL around us are having."
depression,ezxkohu,t3_d2yh0g,1568242840.0,"Sounds like your drained mentally. I know the feeling for sure. I always try or consider putting myself in a healthy mind space and will tell myself-- you need to be productive today""( bc most of the time if I'm not, I feel even more like shit). But it's hard and I'll fall back to my same regressing tendencies. Just the same hopeless feeling."
introvert,ey41akk,t1_ey3v708,1566779168.0,"Lol ur funny my dude. Umm I'd say I have my days where I feel like the sht but that it's VERY very rare. I always tell ppl that I don't feel like I look ugly but I'm also not ""all that"" lol."
Anxiety,ey40tam,t3_cvfter,1566778829.0,"Haha ur not alone. I'll have head phones in and proceed to turn the volume down if it's too loud. Literally will pull the buds out and see if thy can be heard outside of my ear. Sometimes it depends on where I'm at too. But it's so normal you know-- it's a projection of our inner and or desired outer self. It has so much sentimental value to us, so for someone outside of ourselves to get a chance to judge it-- is detracting from emotional privacy. And I say ""emotional privacy"" bc if u think about it something as simple as looking at someone's music playlist can really tell u so much about a person. The growth and development that person has been through can also be indicated in the sequence of the music playlist we create for ourselves."
depression,ey3xrqk,t3_cv7dqu,1566776519.0,"Don't ever apologize for how u feel. About that lol: I actually always have to say to myself alot--"" stop apologizing, stop apologizing"". I always feel like an inconvenience for everyone lol so seeing u say sorry just reminds me of the part of me I try to tone down.
Anyways üéÇ Happyüéâ Birthday !üéÇ üéâ It's your day and sometimes ppl overlook the importance of events like your birth day. Even if a few say happy birthday and acknowledge your day I get how demeaning it could feel if your not showered with recognition ( and dude that's ok, your not over reacting). Sorry about your Dad. I'm glad that you have a few friend though that cared enough to say happy birthday."
introvert,ey2b7xb,t3_cv3rcf,1566733447.0,"Lmfao this is me waaaay to often. I remember when I was younger I would stare at the walls when I was depressed and or mad bc I got disciplined (most of the time it was justified punishment lol but I held grudges bc I want to keep my innocence). Anyways I   would always speak out loud asking God why me why is my life like blah blah blah and so on. . . I'd look at the walls and literally look for answers. Example: ""Will I ever be attractive?"". . . *Scans the wall*. And if I found markings tht resembled a yes or a no I would take that a some kind of sign. Lol that's how depressed and hopeless I was. Made myself delusional."
ForeverAlone,exv7wxu,t3_cu57rz,1566594285.0,"Ugh it would bother me so much to hear  ""are you mad?""-- as if your the one out of line. You don't owe them anything and definitely don't need to place yourself in an atmosphere that'll just drown your ego. I hate that social mentality people have (most frequently in groups); their basically underlying saying you need to suck it up. I feel you so much w this post . . . I always felt like I never belonged; was always in the way, and need to prove myself otherwise. This story brought back memories of how I always felt inevitably incompetent in connecting w ppl. Maybe u felt and or feel this way too (referring to the humiliation u felt)-- but it's always seems as though everyone around me already has ""their people"". . . ""their clique"", if I can say tht. That seems like the case here. They seem to have the bond and their challenging u almost. Sucks that people can't just be inviting and aware of everyone around them. It baffles me sometimes but then again u can't assume that everyones gonna feel reliable for ur feelings. But for me I find I'm always actively tending to everyone emotionally when it comes to socializing."
