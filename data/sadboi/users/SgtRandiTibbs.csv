We were supposed to hang out and play N64 but my drink got drugged and I have foggy, horrible memories. It was hard to talk about because people just seem to assume if you didn't want it then it would be easier to stop a woman or something. Plus the idiots that say ""all women are a little bit gay."" No. Some are, some aren't. Also, I'm straight and it was still horrible when I was assaulted by a male so its not like your sexual preference makes it any less of a violation. I'm really sorry for what you went through. Its possible that your spouse has notmalized it a bit to herself as a coping mechanism but you might need a different approach.

Him being remorseful and trying to live on to be a better person might help soothe your soul. Either way, if he does nothing this is not your fault. Its okay to propose that and not attend the family functions if nothing comes of it. The emotional distress is not worth it and maybe if you feel ready you can attend a future event.

labrats,f7wyjx4,t1_f7t4km7,1574041524.0,The pressure cooker is a really great idea! Ive even seen them for cheap at goodwill. Mostly just for after a bird is really sick I'd like to have a few lines of defense. In a few years one of the labs I work with is replacing their back up autoclave and I've put the shelter down as next in line to get the used one instead of a university (the school they usually donate to already has awesome ones and this thing is like a very small barrel). If I can get a UV wand donated too then thatd be great but I think you're probably right about it being not really necessary.
labrats,f7wxtvw,t1_f7rs8cr,1574040977.0,I dont think the surface is moveable and its too big to put in an oven but we do put clean towels down. The pens are probably fine. I think one of the biggest costs for the shelter is lab grade cleaning agents and they're on a rotation so its pretty thorough. Thank you for your suggestions. Maybe I'll try alcohol on a part of it and see how it goes
labrats,f7q31ev,t1_f7p9mah,1573958086.0,"Thats pretty cool that you worked with orangutangs! I'd honestly be a little scared of them, or at least of hurting their feelings. This operation is pretty small and we are dilligent with keeping the facility clean. Theres really just the one cotton surface the birds are placed on for examination that I'm concerned about. Also it would just be nice to have a second layer of defense with the non porous s.urfaces, like the pens we keep the animals in.
 I also work in a lot more strict of a lab for my day job so it's possible I'm just overthinking it and the current method is fine. I just always look for improvements when possible :)"
labrats,f7q20ur,t1_f7pdi1w,1573957681.0,"Cost factors in a lot. This is a small organization and doesn't have an in house vet. The vet that does work on the birds does use sterile tools, but I'm looking for something to use in the small lab. We have a cushioned surface to lie the animals on for applying medicine, hand removing parasites, and any other non surgical treatments. Everything is cleaned regularily but we do come in contact with pretty harsh illnesses. I'm just looking for a simple way to step up the sterility. I know some companies use uv sterilization wands thats cost ~$80 when doing water pipe set up. I'm just wondering how effective that would actually be."
