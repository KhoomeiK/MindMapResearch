BPD,f9819t3,t3_e3eytd,1575172744.0,"Thank you for sharing your story. I’m honestly crying reading this. I am almost exactly one year into my journey. I have finished DBT once and re-enrolled. I am amazed at how most days are compared to a year ago, but still struggle so much. Hearing the possibility of recovery always makes me optimistic and feel even more committed. I know it’s a long road but I’m glad it gets easier to trek."
