CPTSD,fj372b5,t3_fb63sf,1582970618.0,Yes! Watching old Star Trek episodes with Spock helped me go no contact with my ex abuser and I am celebrating 8 months no contact today. I think of his logic when I want to break no contact. It‚Äôs worked for me.
ExNoContact,fj36udo,t3_fb1yuf,1582970294.0,Congrats! Keep going! It only gets better. Hugs to you!
ExNoContact,fj365dl,t3_fb2xud,1582969265.0,"Thanks for the reminder! 
I am 8 months absolutely no contact today. (blocked him on everything, I‚Äôve moved, gone no contact with mutual ‚Äòfriends,‚Äô avoid going to any place that I know he frequents- I‚Äôm lucky to live in a big city) 
I work the SLAA program and attend Codependent Anonymous meetings and have a sponsor. This is why I‚Äôm sober from him today. I am so grateful. 
I‚Äôm still in a lot of pain, but not nearly as much as I was the first couple of months. 
I am enjoying throwing myself back into my work, enjoying quality time with good friends, not dating, and developing a relationship with myself. It‚Äôs bewildering how much I lost connection to myself during those years of abuse, and I am committed to staying no contact and healing. Sending love to you all. So grateful."

NarcissisticAbuse,fex2307,t3_eqrqv7,1579423055.0,Sounds like a narc to me. It is my firm opinion that you deserve better than this man is willing/able to offer to a partner.
BPD,fewz9qx,t3_eqrdtd,1579421775.0,"I agree. This and the anger outbursts out of nowhere. Just want to share some things that have helped me with relationships. I‚Äôve been going to Codependents Anonymous meetings for a couple years now, and it has really helped me with this. Just sitting in a CodA meeting once per week and listening and reading the coda book has done wonders for my relationships. The Al Anon ‚ÄòCourage To Change ll‚Äô book and Melody Beattie‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Language of Letting Go‚Äô are my morning reading with my notebook as I do my morning pages which helps too. If I don‚Äôt do this, my emotions build up and it‚Äôs really noticeable. I hope this helps someone."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fewya90,t3_eqnxyl,1579421344.0,"Yesss! Congratulations! 
I‚Äôve been no contact for 202 days now, except I have been renting a place on the same street as him (he‚Äôs in our old place) as I started renting from a neighbor friend close by during our YEAR long breakup. 
Still here and I occasionally see him out walking, but give him no eye contact. Of course it triggers me every time I see him. 
Can‚Äôt wait to get my own place in another neighborhood soon! Thank you for inspiring me to take that leap! Here‚Äôs to your new found freedom!"

I have mine blocked on emails, social media, phone and WhatsApp, ect. 

Much love and keep going! It only gets better."
NarcissisticAbuse,fdzej7d,t3_en7rlp,1578789462.0,"Yes, it was like a little pivot for me, a moment of clarity that night. 

I was only sober for 1 year & 3 months at that point in aa, working a solid program, sponsor, steps, in the arms of my fellows. (Still am) Unintentionally it sort of triangulated Him! He knew that I would share the abuse with my fellows and sponsor, and complain to me about it. Ask weird questions. Was worried and tried to behave more once I got into the program. 

We had been in a year long break up. I was coming out of the brainwashing whereas I would think that if I loved him, or was more compassionate and forgiving, he would see the light and heal. I subconsciously thought this was somehow my responsibility for so long. Was so tired. But was deeply into the first season of Star Trek, (1960‚Äôs) and had my program and sobriety/clarity. 

I remember that night. All of the struggles to make the plan of hanging out happen, his fussiness, the usual; him only talking about himself, his dose of poison. His word salad. Then upon getting intimate after withholding sex from me for weeks, he started a fight with me. He went to the bathroom continuing to argue, and I thought of how Mr. Spock would handle this. 

‚ÄúBickering is pointless.‚Äù
-Mr. Spock

I had just seen this episode of ST a few nights before. 

I thought of how I would always be JADE-ing in reaction to the N Ex, not responding logically like Spock. (JADE- Justifying myself, Arguing, Defending myself, Engaging the N Ex) I decided to put my emotions aside in that moment and use logic. 

I calmly got up, and got dressed slowly. It wasn‚Äôt in self-pity, it wasn‚Äôt in anger, it wasn‚Äôt done codependently to manipulate him to chase me like the many times I had done this act before. 

It was to get away from a monster. Like walking away from a wild animal with caution. 

I visualized being at home in my bedroom, in my pajamas, safe on my white fluffy bed, maybe with a cup of tea and watching an episode of Star Trek instead of engaging him. 

I dressed. He came out of the bath room still yelling. I slowly got my coat on and was already in front of his door. 

He called me selfish, and I said, ‚ÄúI am going to go home and have a peaceful night‚Äù and I started heading out his door and walking down the driveway. 

He didn‚Äôt follow me. I was relived, and felt a calmness wash over me. It was my higher power or guide. 

I looked up at the sky and felt like I was on a different path all of a sudden. It was like the driveway beneath me was like a bridge to my new life. And it was! 

That was last Summer. 

I blocked him on social media, his phone number, email everything. No Contact.

The first 3 weeks were the absolute hardest. I attended all kinds of 12 step meetings and just listened at some of the harder drug meetings, and talked to other women. 

Another fellow suggested to me that this was a trauma bond, and I looked it up and learned that the cocktail of cortisol/oxytocin is as addictive as hard drugs, and every time I had an urge to contact him or missed him I would pick up the phone and call a fellow instead, or got to a meeting, or read the SLAA book, or pray, or add a bad memory of something he did to me after reading the Why I Left list in the notes on my phone. And I made it through. Only by seeing him as a hard core drug. And a vampire, not a person really. More like a demon. It worked for me. 

I am never alone if I don‚Äôt want to be. I am loved and supported by the women of Codependents Anonymous and women‚Äôs SLAA meetings. I can‚Äôt recommend them enough. I also listen to the weekly and daily SLAA inspiration lines and read the SLAA book, and I don‚Äôt feel alone, there is a solution. I‚Äôm working aa too, and as soon as I am ready to I am going to work the steps in another program (either SLAA or Coda) after my first round of steps in aa in complete. Also, a trauma therapist and the audio book ‚ÄòWhole Again‚Äô have been huge for my recovery. 

I have a no eye contact rule. If I for some reason ever see him again, I will slowly walk away and he is a ghost to me. 

I avoid and have lost a few mutual friends that are super codependent to him (I call them members of his narc harem of women who baby him) and oh well, my life is better without the insanity of that vampire.

I just celebrated 6 months no contact. Life is still so hard, but I am alive and grateful and awake, and no longer being verbally, sexually, financially, emotionally abused! Thank God."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fdltmh0,t3_eletyl,1578532205.0,"My N Ex would suddenly hate f%*k me in the middle of sex...it was awful. I don‚Äôt know if it counts as rape. He would very aggressively turn on me during sex and hold me down and it would hurt physically and emotionally. This happened 4-5 times in our 2 year relationship. I remember quietly crying in the shower and feeling so violated. The trauma bond was so deep I would have amnesia about it and never mention it to him, as I was afraid of him and he had complete power over me. So grateful to be No Contact going on 7 months today."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fdlotwy,t3_eluuut,1578528943.0,"I‚Äôve dealt with both...

The 2 more psychopathic (high functioning) narcs would study the shit outta me and always get me the most incredible gifts. Rare, out of print books, a cashmere sweater that fit, massages, trips to Japan, a Martin guitar...but then they thought they ‚Äòowned‚Äô me....

My bpd narc mom still gives me things that she orders from catalogs that didn‚Äôt work out, or dollar store (Big Lots) crap. Stuff I have to donate immediately. She doesn‚Äôt care who I am. Period. She‚Äôs just a poor little victim."
