My main move is in regular cowgirl, lean forward so you’re leaning on your forearms, and then twerk your ass up and down. When I do this I’ll also make little circles as I twerk so his cock is hitting inside of me at every angle I can manage! I switch between that (which I do the majority of the time) sitting back and straight up until my legs hurt too much, and sitting down so his cock his completely in me and grinding down onto it. The twerking method is also fun because you can control how much you take, and just bounce on the top to tease him before plunging him inside of you. Hope this helps!"

AskReddit,fmjyr62,t3_fruade,1586140496.0,"I potty trained myself. 

I felt so guilty asking my parents to change me in the middle of then night I had asked them to leave my pull-ups in a drawer in my closet. I eventually stopped wanting to wake up in the middle of the night to change, and never involuntarily peed during the night. I was then able to change to underwear quickly after I took control over changing myself. having accomplished the final stage of potty training."

My sleep is always broken but the early hours have seemed to be getting to me. I definitely also needed a little extra TLC from my partner for the last week, but they’ve been pretty distracted with a gaming chat they’re in. Feeling like I wasn’t interesting or getting his attention in the few hours I could see them this week was a bit of a trigger as well. Thank you for your kind words and understanding!"

Revel in the feeling of pride, and know it gets more obvious and easier to identify as time goes on. Not reacting absolutely gets to someone with BPD, because they just want that reaction/attention. Keep up the good work and good luck!"

If my mom starts putting on a show I literally ignore her and keep talking or doing whatever I was doing without acknowledging her statement. You’re not giving her the attention that she’s trying to scam out of you, and maintaining those boundaries that are necessary for survival! Keep on keeping on you grey rock!"

There have been so many people I have helped suffering from similar issues, and they were truly beautiful people who deserved to be helped- just like you do! Mental health hospitals are nothing like culture often convinces us, they are meant to be a safe haven and I have seen so much beauty in my time working in one. Best of luck, and don't be afraid to invest in your mental health, your wellbeing, and your future by getting the help you need."

Including some personalized items might be a nice touch, like if she likes coffee get a personalized coffee mug or if she drinks wine get her a personalized wine glass! Things like nice smelling lotion, a book or cool poems or quotes, or even lavender scented adult play-doh is fun and helps with everyday stress through different senses. Best of luck, you sound like a lovely friend."
