Miscarriage,fmxsrcb,t1_fmxk06p,1586471153.0,Thank you so much for your reply. With all this Covid-19 stuff going on I haven't been able to see my doctor in person (he's just doing phone call appointments) so this subreddit has been very helpful!
Miscarriage,fmxslty,t1_fmxfbix,1586471068.0,Thank you for your reply!! That helps a lot.

cocaine,fmc9db2,t3_fudsst,1585941356.0,For me drinking takes the edge off of just doing straight snow which can give me anxiety in large doses! Also drinking helps me immensely with the comedown and being able to eventually pass out after.

EatingDisorders,fb9owz5,t1_fb9odtx,1576644769.0,Also just wanted to add- thank you for sharing this! This is something I've been thinking about a lot but have never really seen it addressed before
EatingDisorders,fb9odtx,t3_dzhfy1,1576644289.0,"I relate to this a lot! My last relationship was with a very overweight guy and I ended up gaining a lot of weight throughout the three year long relationship, both because of naturally copying his unhealthy eating habits and the fact that the relationship itself was very unhealthy and caused me to binge eat. Towards the end of that relationship I began restricting and lost about 50 pounds. Now I'm at a pretty healthy/ normal weight. But now I'm dating a very skinny guy and it triggers my ED and causes me to mimic his poor eating habits. I envy his bony figure and it makes me judge myself a lot. I'm not sure how to combat this besides learning to love yourself and fill your time with positive activities/ people. Best of luck!"
