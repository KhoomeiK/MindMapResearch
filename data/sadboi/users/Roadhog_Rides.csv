Anyone with a younger sibling can tell you how easy it is to manhandle them. You could fuck up 5 year olds like it's going out of style, unless you're some physically stunted weakling. One fucking wallop to the face and they're out. The hardest part would be trying to not hurt yourself from hitting so many of them, but that could be solved by using your feet and head too, as well as grappling them and throwing them around like oversized bags of potatoes. It would honestly be a cathartic power trip to fight that many 5 year olds, no holds barred. 

You'd be at such an advantage that you could fucking go for style points, comboing the fuckers and going for collaterals. I honestly cant fathom why anyone would choose to fight old people over children. It makes me wonder if theyve never interacted with a child younger than them. They are pathetically weak and helpless, especially at 5 years of age."

Lore wise, I'm not really certain he's even killable. Even Hayden says so at the end of DOOM 2016. Now, you could argue he says that not because he literally can't kill him, but because he's too useful to kill, but Hayden thought he had everything under control by the end of 2016. He had the crucible and essentially just had the slayer there for the same reason the demons trapped him, to keep him restrained and unable to fuck things up for them. If he were truly killable then why didn't the demons just drop his tomb in a volcano and call it good?

So, really, the best anyone could do in 40k to stop him is the same thing the demons had to do, trap him and keep him there."

Finally went to the doctor and told them. Instead of gaslighting me like my mom did when I told her my symptoms, they gave me an EKG and tested me for COVID and the woman I met with, who is my new doctor, went through everything with me and got me medication for my anxiety and sleep.

And what happened? I feel completely fine now. All I needed was someone to take me seriously and honestly make sure I was fine by actually checking. I left the clinic feeling so much relief. What was probably mild asthma was exasperated greatly by my anxiety getting out of control because I thought I had COVID or heart disease. 

Lesson of the story, find someone who will help make sure you're okay and reassure you of such. Don't tell people who will just gaslight you and tell you you're fine. It will make it worse."

We're only at the beginning of this pandemic, New York is a great example of what the rest of the US will look like in a couple weeks, and even they aren't near the end of it. We will not be prepared to start working by then again. 

As has been mentioned by numerous health officials, we have to level the curve. If we ignore that advice, hospitals will be overwhelmed and you will have situations like in Italy where there are having to decide who lives and dies. To say that is a horrifying and disturbing situation is an understatement. 

We are talking about grandparents and even some younger people dying, isolated, alone, unable to even see their loved ones at their bedside. They dont even get to say goodbye. It is a tragedy beyond compare. 

Yes, many people will get it, and we do need to accept that. But it can't happen all at once. And being so eager to find a point where we just start everything up again is ignorant. We have to slow our roll and get everybody in on also accepting the fact that we need to shut things down for awhile in order to overcome this without it being a massive humanitarian disaster. The economy and money are important, but not moreso than human lives and preventing suffering.
