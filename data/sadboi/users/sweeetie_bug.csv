CPTSD,f8tyaxp,t3_dx91bj,1574814310.0,"Late to the game but this really does hit home for me.  Since I went NC for ten years now I have dreamed of having a family of my own.  While I’m married, his family doesn’t really like me or appreciate me.  Which is hard as well.

My family consists of two dogs, good friends and my husband that fills some of the void for me.  I don’t miss “my family” but what I do miss are the links and traditions that no one understand except myself and my family.  What I miss is the blood relationship I had with people.  

What has helped me partially but not completely is finding inner love and inner support by taking care of myself.  I have found hobbies during this time....I go to friends thanksgivings.  While none of that is a true replacement, I find that I would rather take care of myself and my sense of peace than deal with the bullshit of my NMom  telling me I’m too fat or I don’t have enough make up on it my Edad giving me looks of disappointment for some odd reason. 

While we don’t get to choose the shit our families give us, we can choose our attitudes, our environment and our reactions to everything and anything.  It’s ok to be sad but don’t stay there.  It’s ok to miss your family and remember your sanity is important.  Create new traditions for yourself! Love yourself!  Be who you want to be!  We all ain’t getting out of here alive and we are gonna be judged anyway so who cares!

It made me fall into relationships that I shouldn’t have, made me lower my standards because I thought that all love and even friendships were just conditional.  After I found my now husband, I realize that you can have love without terms and conditions.  But what I think is the saddest is that our families are so broken they can’t see past their own conditional love either.  

While I love them, I sure as hell don’t like them.  My only issue is when they pass away.  I am not sure how I’d handle that... granted I think not one knows till it happens"
Marriage,f84acft,t3_dyxp75,1574237897.0,"This sucks!  Sorry you’re going through this!  Been married for 10 years and have had similar issues.  Spouse would do things when I was watching but instead of making things habit and helping, he would wait till I wasn’t watching/ got busy and then would slowly stop helping or doing things all together....

I had enough of it.  I stopped cleaning his clothes, dishes, anything he used I didn’t touch.  He’d get upset when he ran out of clean socks to wear or that his dirty work clothes weren’t being washed. Or if he couldn’t find his keys and shoes. When he used the dishes I had cleaned but he didn’t clean after, I used plastic forks, spoons etc and used them for me only.  

After about a month of this we had a long long talk.  I’m his wife not his momma.  And I refused to be treated like an indentured servant.  We talked about how he treats me, why he’s so damn lazy, all of it.   

Are things better? Yes and no.  He still leaves clothes in places and his socks under his desk.  But I turn a blind eye to them now.  If your stuff isn’t in the right places they don’t get cleaned.  If you don’t help out with dishes, laundry general pick up, I don’t help with cars, groceries, lawn work etc.  

You shouldn’t have to raise 3 kids on your own (spouse acting as a child).  Set your boundaries, stick to them.  If you’re the bread winner make him stay home and watch the kids!  You already work taking care of people, no one wants to come home and have their job waiting for them there too."

When I came home for Christmas I saw them for who they were.   Narcissistic, greedy, unforgiving, dispassionate people that only cared about money and power.   

After my mid 20s I cut them out completely because they didn’t want me to get married or have kids.   They wanted a cash cow to supply them with money.  Fuck that.  I didn’t get into bankruptcy, I didn’t throw away my life, instead I became something.   

My father has tried to reach out to me several times asking me to apologize for all the hurt I caused the family.   He couldn’t explain what I did wrong or why my mother had it out for me.  I told him that if he loved me he would have done something to preserve the family but instead you chose your wife over your own flesh and blood. my last words to him were “ you are not my father “.

I then started to pray that my family would come back to me and be normal, but it never happened either.  After getting into therapy, EMDR, CBT, the correct diagnosis, etc I discovered that God does answer prayers.  And it was all protection. 

If you believe in God or not doesn't really matter.  What matters is that what you're doing is a form of protection for your mind and soul.  You will miss them, cry about them, wish they would change and you can have a family again but the problem was never you to begin with.  It was never your stuff.  

It's like when an addict goes through withdrawals.  It's hard at first.  Can't sleep, eat, think straight.  But everyday it gets better.  You just have to keeping going one day at a time.  

I hope you have a good therapist and doctor to help you.  And I am proud that you made this first step.

Since I have cut off my parents, I feel freer than I ever have.  I got a second childhood back, I love and do things my way.  I love myself the way they couldn't.

What some men need to know is that they don't have to find a ""need"" to fix but rather replace that ""I need to fix"" with ""I want to be with someone that doesn't need anything from me"".  I guess what I'm saying is some men and some women should replace ""I need XYZ"" with "" I want XYZ"".
