I had mediocre grades in high school (<85) but genny gave me a chance. Furthermore, my geology experience at geneseo changed my life completely. We went to like every midwestern state for camping trips, found insane fossils, mapped out a few neat folds and formations, went to Niagara Falls like at least twice a year for various trips, etc. Each class (minus hydrogeology) had associated field trips. The professors all knew their stuff really damn well and were great teachers. The class sizes were on the smaller side, so we got individualized attention and became a closely knit friend group. Our senior seminar required us to do field camp with them, which in relatively recent previous years has been held in Iceland, New Zealand, California/Nevada, and I think Peru."

In fact, your college probably anticipates this sort of thing to happen with the newer pool of students. 

So what does one do?

When this happened to me, it was kind of a shock. I had to identify every possible reason for why I was failing, and try to fix them. I also had to propose a solution to my parents who would later ask why they received a letter stating I’m on the verge of getting kicked out. That meant: 

- enrolling for easier classes next semester, to ensure no matter what I do I’d achieve the minimum passing requirement. Since I was in my first year, I had a bunch of required general education requirement classes to choose from. At my college you had to fail two consecutive semesters to be put on academic suspension or worse. I imagine your school has something similar. 

- starting a morning coffee routine at the library 

- learned how to study. This was big; I had to completely change how I viewed the act of studying, and get tutored on how to do it. For each notebook I owned, I owned another notebook to make a carbon copy of the first. Rewriting notes slowly and with purpose helps a lot. 

- stopped going to parties, and played far less Xbox than I used to

- I learned how to make the library my surrogate home. As mentioned, I started my day at the library. I’d go to class, but afterward I wouldn’t go home- I’d go back to the library. Sometimes it didn’t matter what I did there, but being in the presence of others studying/working will put you in the right mindset. I ended my day at around 8pm, so I’d be in the library from sunrise to sunset each day. 

This was maybe the largest step I’ve ever taken in my life, and it took two painful months before it became a habit that I couldn’t break out of. PM me if you have any questions about this, I’d be glad to help."
