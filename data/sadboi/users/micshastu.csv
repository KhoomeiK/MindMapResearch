Etsy,fqq2sy4,t1_fqq25pw,1589558426.0,The last 30 days my Etsy search is up 209% and I haven’t changed anything.
Etsy,fqq2cpv,t1_fqq25pw,1589558205.0,"Oh. That’s interesting if the off site ads being on is affecting search in Etsy. I don’t have the option to turn them off but I have had a lot of sales the past month, even one week surpassing a typical Xmas shopping week. I wonder if I was pushed up in search since I have them on."
Etsy,fqq22xe,t3_gk90w7,1589558073.0,"Before the off-site ads option, wasn’t Etsy paying for them?  Maybe you were getting sales from offsite and didn’t know it. Check your past stats to see where most of that traffic came from when you would sell out."
conspiracy,fqpqzmw,t1_fqpgrd3,1589552330.0,I’ve seen posts from multiple people that are ghosting their employers that are opening back up because they want to stay furloughed. Many are making more on unemployment than they were working so they don’t want to go back. My advice to those people is that the job may not be there to go back to once the extra $600 stops coming their way and then they will be stuck. If your employer offers you work then please go back.
florida,fqmlk4o,t3_gjmxuk,1589479448.0,At the grocery store I see about 60% of people that are wearing masks constantly touching their face to readjust their mask. This is worse than not wearing one.
AskHR,fqmkkjj,t3_gjc66j,1589478977.0,If a job offers employment back and she can’t go then she is basically resigning. It sucks but it is not technically a lay-off any longer if the job is available.
Etsy,fqdjfdq,t3_gi8kv6,1589290954.0,I turned off international shipping a couple years ago because I would get complaints about customs fees or delayed packages. I was afraid my sales would go down but they didn’t. It was just easier to not have the headache of people not reading descriptions and having to deal with upset people.
AskHR,fq5zhtk,t3_ggvaqn,1589121264.0,Why are you refusing work?  Usually when you are collecting unemployment you have to certify that you weren’t offered work. If you are offered work and refuse then you don’t get unemployment. If you lie on the question then you are committing fraud. If caught you may be subject to fines. It’s going to be hard to find another job for a long time. Don’t refuse work.
AskHR,fq5z5go,t1_fq5se1n,1589121046.0, Well the employer is offering for them to come in and work. If he refuses then he is basically quitting.
AskHR,fq5z1on,t3_ggvaqn,1589120980.0,You either return to work because they are open now or quit. If you quit you probably won’t be paid unemployment because you refused work. Unemployment is for if you are laid off and can’t find work.

orlando,fp0vuyd,t1_fp00uto,1588218089.0,Most of the restaurants I go to (even the small ones) are still doing to go orders so if they are able to open 25% then it should increase their sales.  Many had to already cut their staff so if they may just have some more come back as needed.

florida,fov5xaz,t1_fov5skm,1588095906.0,Yeah I had it for the first time last year. The process was a pain then. I can’t imagine now when the website is down so much!
florida,fov4y74,t1_fov4lzy,1588095452.0,Weird. Maybe since they are processing so many they just didn’t apply it to anyone’s. I just know last year I would get $495 for 2 weeks after taxes (which was 10%) . I was eligible for the full $275. When I did my taxes this year the paperwork they sent me showed the total taxes they deducted.
Etsy,fov1foy,t1_fouxm5f,1588093831.0,"But you wouldn’t have gotten that sale at all if it wasn’t advertised outside of Etsy. If you are under $10,000 /yr then you can opt out. If you are over then you can probably cancel the sales as they come in or move to another website."
Etsy,foux29k,t1_fouvyjn,1588091810.0,"In my experience I make more with less work. You may have less sales but you are making more per sale and aren’t working as much. I guess it depends on what you sell. 

   If you were to have your own website then you need to drive your own traffic. It usually results in paying for advertising unless you already have a huge following willing to follow you over. 

   If this is a hobby then you may have low profit per sale. To make into a profitable business you should be making enough profit to make the work worthwhile. There was a video about this on Etsy awhile back. It talks about how to price your items. Some people also go with a higher priced item because they view it as higher quality. It’s a shoppers perspective depending on your target audience."
Etsy,fouocqh,t3_g9owpd,1588087673.0,I make stickers on my Dymo. I get bubble mailers from Royal Mailers and tissue paper from Amazon.
florida,foubfrr,t1_fouahdj,1588080723.0,I honestly don’t know. I know when I applied last year it asked me if I wanted taxes deducted. They deduct 10%. You can always put 10% aside as you get payment but if you can’t afford that then just be aware you may owe next year.
florida,foua8nq,t3_g9lc5w,1588079973.0,I see you didn’t opt to have taxes taken out. Just be aware when you file your taxes next year you will owe some of this money back. Not sure about the $600 but the $275 is definitely taxed.
Etsy,fou5eh3,t3_g9hdc8,1588076654.0,Yes. If not then your prices aren’t high enough.
AskHR,foqd1qq,t3_g8yzoq,1587990530.0,"When I did FMLA I notified HR and they sent me paperwork to have my Dr fill out. I never gave it to my manager. It was between myself and HR. The manager only knew when I was approved but not why. You will have to give the completed paperwork filled out by your doctor to HR. They have to make sure to make sure it was completed. They won’t tell your boss the reason. They are only allowed to say that you are FMLA approved. 
Notify HR you want to apply for FMLA and they should send you the paperwork."
Etsy,fonxihi,t3_g8hua5,1587928419.0,My sales have been up too. This past week I am close to making what I make around Xmas time. I sell bracelets and haven’t added any new listings. I think people are just bored at home shopping online.
Etsy,folfk2a,t3_g7yst6,1587861149.0,I think is fine to sell them. You are getting compensated for the supplies and your time. I am seeing a lot being made on Etsy.

self,fn5kkpo,t1_fn50m0u,1586667408.0,Yes it’s important to put some of the UI aside because even if your state withholds some taxes they may not hold enough and you may owe next year. Where I live they only take out 10% or you can opt to not have them withhold anything. It’s still income you will get taxed on.

Etsy,fk6csvk,t3_fgqnuf,1583898777.0,Since you already shipped the items the review window may open before the items are cancelled. When did you ship?  Once you cancel it takes 48 hours and if it makes the buyer mad they may try and leave a review. It all depends on timing but I don’t know when exactly Etsy allows people to leave a review.

I am curious about those so against the new ads with google. Yes, if someone finds you with a google ad and purchases you will have to pay a fee but wouldn’t that be better than no sale at all?  You should be listing your products at a high enough price to still make a profit with fees taken out. If not then your prices should be raised because you are working too hard for too little profit. 

I am not trying to put anyone down who doesn’t want it but I am very curious why not."

This past year I put my shop on vacation for 2.5 months and it only took about 2 weeks to get back to normal and my sales actually went up from what I was previously getting.

Etsy,fjefe91,t3_fd0whe,1583270900.0,Someone on here told me to extend the shipping time out before you cancel so they can’t leave a review on a canceled order. If you haven’t cancelled yet you can try that. As far as not being able to fulfill the order... don’t sweat it. Unfortunate things happen sometimes out of your control. You are right in refunding. I have had big box retailers cancel orders on me for items that went out of stock.  Maybe offer the customer a coupon if they want to reorder in the future when your mail is back up and running.

Etsy,fis9j8q,t1_fis99nu,1582680614.0,That is true. Since they are a guest I don’t think they can leave a review but they can probably still open a case. I am not desperate for the sale so it might be less stressful to cancel. If they really want it they can reorder. I will probably give them a little longer to see if they respond.
Etsy,fis1s0q,t3_f9dlv1,1582675840.0,Sorry to hear that happened to you. I have offered people a discount if they reach out and they never respond again. Maybe next time If you want to do that again make them pay for it and tell them you will refund them after they post.
