Advice,fr4c2jo,t1_fr2ckjw,1589883289.0,"I’m 52, going through a break/breakup in a relationship with an alcoholic, and this is all excellent advice. Take this time and find yourself. Not you as you related to him, not you as you take care of others, just YOU, pure and simple. Honestly I’d probably get counseling or go to AlAnon too because being with someone with a drinking problem can really distort your thinking in ways you may not be aware of, particularly if you are young. I know you’re in pain, and I know every day sucks right now. But you’ll get through it. Just take it one day or hour at a time, focus on being the best you you can be, and one day you will wake up and realize that maybe things are going to be ok."

My current MM is wildly different. We’ve been together 4 years, he has had multiple other APs during that time besides me, and if I had $1 for every time he’s sworn off me and the others I’d be a wealthy, wealthy woman. He’s completely self centered in a way my first husband never was, and never will be.

therapy,fq5v1qw,t3_ggyuet,1589118179.0,"A couple of thoughts: think about what brings you joy. Make a list - the longer the better. It can be anything. Then make a point to add those experiences into your life, every day if possible. What do you love doing, what gets you out of your own head, what makes you lose track of time? Do those things. Often. Plan them into your day, take weekend trips to do them, join a meetup group to do them, whatever. But do it. I have chronic suicidality and bipolar disorder with treatment resistant depression and deliberately adding joy has made a tremendous difference in my quality of life. 

Also, consider doing CBT with your therapist. Changing the way I think through CBT techniques has made more difference than anything. I’ve been able to cut back on the suicidal thoughts from near-constant to once or twice a week (tops) passing thoughts. Very different. Also, pay attention to your inner voice. There’s a good chance it isn’t nice. If that’s the case for you, changing that to a kind and caring voice will make a huge difference too. It takes time - it took me about 6 months of working on it consistently - but it’s life changing. 

Good luck in your journey."

It’s like taking a class, except it’s just you and the instructor and the class is specific to your individual needs. If you were trying to upgrade a skill for work or wanted to learn something new as a hobby you wouldn’t feel bad about needing to learn it, right? Therapy is the same concept.

If I’m cleaning, for example, there’s always one thing that’s making me more nuts than everything else, so I start with that. It isn’t always the most important task, or the biggest, or the most obvious; it’s just the thing that’s causing me the most discomfort, or that I’m most drawn to (in the case of a new skill/idea.)

My brain is finally quiet - I had no idea other people don’t go through life with the mental equivalent of a 100-decibel punk rock band with a mosh pit playing in their head all the time. I also have chronic stress headaches and the funny part is how the meds worked out. The neurologist gave me topamax for the headaches; it did nothing for the pain but turned out to be a great mood stabilizer for me and works better than anything I’ve ever been on (which is most of them.) Not long after I saw the neurologist and the topamax had kicked in I had an appointment with the psych and he prescribed Strattera for the new ADHD diagnosis. As it turns out, Strattera also kills the headaches and has prevented them every day I’ve taken it.

For you, maybe make a list of things you’d like to do, or learn, things you might enjoy doing as a hobby, etc. And then start doing them, one at a time. Make a point to take time for this. Meetups can be a good way to meet people to do things with (virtually now, and IRL after the pandemic), and many places have cheap or free courses, and there are many online. Creative pursuits also have the added benefit of being therapeutic, so you might be able to integrate something with your therapy.

My 12 year old also has learning disabilities, and I have bipolar disorder and anxiety, so I have been where you are almost exactly. What you’re going through is BRUTAL and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Single parenting is difficult under the best of circumstances and when your child has special needs, and you have mental health challenges, it’s even more so. 

The single most important thing for you to do is to take care of yourself FIRST. If you don’t take care of yourself you will crash and burn, and that will not help anyone. I learned this lesson the hard way. Don’t let your mother guilt you into not using the daycare. If she isn’t going to take care of your kids then she has no say in the matter whatsoever. Ignore her completely (go grey rock if necessary.) Your older child should be eligible for services (occupational therapy, ABA, etc) due to his autism; check with the local elementary school guidance counselor and social worker. Find out now what’s available so when the pandemic lifts you will have everything in place. (I think it’s called Child Find, but they will be able to tell you.) Don’t let them blow you off because they will probably try. Keep pushing. He may also be eligible for SSI, and if so that might be enough money to allow you to move into your own space. 

See your doctor and/or therapist about your depression - it doesn’t sound like it’s in check, and unless it is you will always be operating at a disadvantage. You are a clearly good mom who loves her kids. You’re just exhausted, as anyone would be. You have a heavy, heavy load, and no one to help you, so it’s critical to get some supports in place before things get out of hand. Feel free to DM me if you need to talk.

mentalhealth,floo1dt,t3_fpzajy,1585342037.0,You should consider getting screened for anxiety and ADD (which often go together.) The behavior you’re describing is very characteristic of both. See your primary care physician or your school might have a health center?
homeowners,flonnlz,t1_floj2o2,1585341821.0,Are they selling the loan to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or are they intending to keep it for their portfolio? That makes a difference in what they can require. (If they are selling it they would likely have received a purchase commitment from the secondary market entity when they locked in your loan rate.)
adhd_anxiety,flm4a66,t1_flkgl4w,1585274235.0,"It feels like a punk rock band playing at full blast on a roller coaster that goes up and down randomly and unpredictably, while 100 people are screaming and moshing and each of them represents an idea or a thought or an impulse. All of this happens 24/7/365."
AmItheAsshole,fl9ky7z,t1_fl9h2gl,1584960336.0,"He said himself that birth control was his responsibility. OP would have known when he decided to have sex that he would not be able to enforce the agreement to have an abortion if a pregnancy occurred. He chose to proceed anyway, and had sex, knowing that having a child result was one possible outcome. So yes, he does have to pay child support. He does not get to walk away from his responsibility just because he placed a losing bet."
therapy,fl89u3n,t3_fn4ykv,1584918924.0,"Sometimes when I get stuck it helps to think about what the incentives are. For example, what is your incentive to keep doing/thinking the way you do? What are you gaining by it? There’s some underlying reason you can’t let go of your way of thinking; what is it exactly about it that scares you?"

therapy,fkww2n4,t3_fl4le2,1584608394.0,"I have an alter-ego named Sabrina who is my inner badass. I have trouble with setting boundaries and being a people pleaser and Sabrina...doesn’t. So I’ve been trying to think and behave more like she would. I talked to my therapist about this and she liked the idea and has encouraged it. So if it works for you, then by all means, keep doing it. It’s also a form of cognitive restructuring - changing the way you think to be something more healthy. So that’s a good way to look at it too."

AmItheAsshole,fkqmhnc,t3_fjz18s,1584450321.0,"NTA. If Paul wants kids and his gf doesn’t he needs to have enough respect for her to let her go. She’s probably not going to change her mind, and he would be cruel to marry her knowing he’s going to try to talk her into it."
AmItheAsshole,fkqmcsp,t1_fkqgb9r,1584450217.0,"My mom and I used to talk about the fact that had she known not having kids was an option, she wouldn’t have had them. But she grew up in the small-town South in the 50’s so marriage and babies is what you did. There’s no doubt she loved us, but she just wasn’t maternal. I’m still in therapy working out the effects."

therapy,fk0glbs,t3_ffpd9b,1583756297.0,"I feel that, so very much. One thing that helps me is making a list of all the little things I would miss by not being here - the first warm day of spring, the smell of a new book, a good hot cup of coffee first thing in the morning, the smell of clean clothes straight from the dryer, the feeling of accomplishment I get when I check a long-neglected task off my to do list. Whatever your things are, make a list. Keep it where you can look at it when you’re feeling down and add to it as you think of things. It makes a big difference."

MaliciousCompliance,fjruj5c,t1_fjrqa49,1583590223.0,"Because the upswing is FUN. It’s the best EVERYTHING  you have ever had, 24/7/365. So much energy, so much great partying, so much great sex, it’s like all of life is an endless amusement park ride, all day every day, until it all comes crashing down in some horrible nonsensical implosion that generally involves medical professionals, hospitalizations, and occasionally police. When you’ve just spent weeks or months in a mental state where you’d really truly rather be dead - no joke, death would be a relief - it doesn’t take much convincing to welcome the highs when they come.

emotionalabuse,fizam9l,t3_fal5wl,1582858080.0,"Your school likely has a social worker. Go talk to them. They have access to resources that you might not. If that doesn’t work, practice gray rock. That’s when you interact with the person - in this case your dad - as little as you possibly can and when you do, you are as interesting as a gray rock. Be boring and non responsive. The idea is that eventually he’ll get bored. Abusers and narcissists get their energy from your reaction; deny him the reaction and you’ll deny him his power.

I don’t ask them to share their important things either."
