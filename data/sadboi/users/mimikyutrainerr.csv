I’m not sure how much of a match that is for you personally, but it’s always better to go a little lighter with drag because of the heavy contour too and all the other colors (at least for me). Also with the kryolan (just some advice), make sure it’s warm because it will not apply well cold. I use a hair dryer or kinda keep it between my crotch while applying my moisturizer and such. Which is another thing I definitely recommend. Moisturizer, primer, and even the kryolan make-up blend will help it apply a lot better. I hope this helps :)

This sub does kinda circle jerk the pot roast, but it is a very easy and decent meal to cook in the slow cooker. If you don’t like the roast, I’d try making like a pork shoulder or something in it instead. Always turns out so good in the slow cooker in my opinion."

Edit: I honestly don’t put powder between gluing but I’ve found adding layers, foundation, and then powder works best for me. Just play around with it and see what works for you! Also if you needed, pros aide is another adhesive people use for eyebrows. It’s a lot more water proof in my opinion and a little bit goes a long way.
