I've no obligation to give you my entire decorating history. I once was a cake decorator and would like to get back into the art-because UNLESS you have no talent nor pride in what you create . . . it is an expression of art.

I've been offered friendlier advice by strangers on Facebook, so I'll stick to that method of reaching out. I had no idea the cake decorating subreddit was such a strict and pretentious forum. What a joke.

Thank you!

Oh! And it literally says on the home page: ""All skill levels and types of cakes welcomed.""

Do you have any suggestions?

I had a very similar and disturbing relationship with a guy I dated

FOR.

EIGHT.

YEARS.

Then, out of the blue, I left him for good. Broke his heart to follow mine.

Fortunately, it was the best decision for both of us. It's been five years and the last I heard was he is now married with two kids. Surpisingly, I am happily married to my childhood sweetheart.

My husband has saved my life by opening my eyes to what a horrible person I had been. He did not put up with my abusive behavior and he fought, to his own detriment, to help me understand how to be a loving, caring, mindful, and selfless partner. He convinced me to seek help. I'm steadily recovering. I'm no longer an abusive person and have learned to control myself. I now know how to love and be loved and it's the most beautiful thing I've ever experienced.

However, I struggle with my guilt and regrets from my past on a daily basis. I wish I would have ended the cycle sooner and I hate that my ex tolerated and enabled my horribly toxic behaviors. I chased away all of his friends and controlled every aspect of his life because that's all I wanted. I was full of hatred and rage and fooled us both into thinking it was love...

One day she may wake up and when that day comes, she's going to hate herself.

Is this what you want to do for the rest of your life?

Are you prepared for the scenario where you devote almost a decade to her and she suddenly ghosts you?

This is good news to me because it doesn't seem to be a genetically inherited mental illness or chemical inbalance. It very well could be, but I would doubt that in most cases--mine, at least. It seems to be a developmental disorder and even mirrors complex post traumatic stress disorder.

BPD, from what I've found, does not have to inflict a lifetime of pain and instability. Recovery is a very real possibility if you're devoted to getting better by learning to communicate and regulate your emotions. Some type of ego-death would do the world some good, but would be especially beneficial to those suffering from BPD. It takes an immensity of self-awareness and dedication.

Maybe find more people to hang out with. Start new friendships and try to eliminate that cycle.

Just a bit of advice, pessimism is not a good quality to bring to a friendship. You could be totally right and they're trying to exclude you, though. They're your friends and you know them better. If so, why not ask them if you've done something to offend them or cause them to want space? Communication is key.

BPD,f8k6t45,t3_e0wc2r,1574608055.0,"I've heard of these ""haters"" but not sought out those subs or comments--for good reason, too. Generally, we are the abusers and they the abused.

Oftentimes, those who survive a relationship with a pwBPD end up suffering from PTSD. Also, fleas. Totally normal people that endure a pwBPD end up acquiring some of their negative behaviors, even though they'd never had any of those before.

I'm not condoning their hatred. In fact, I don't think it's healthy to their recovery to be so negative and resentful. However, many times those people enter into a relationship as mentally healthy individuals expecting their partners to be the same. What a tremendous betrayal. . . 

Symptoms of BPD aren't always evident and many of us hide our true selves. So, of course there is going to be resentment for the abuse, especially if we do not try to get better. There is nothing we can do about our pasts. There is no way to change how they feel because they are usually the ones who were wronged and left with emotional wounds that may take a lifetime to heal.

Don't read those anymore. It's not good for you; there's absolutely no benefit to your mental health.

If you are trying to be a better person and make up for your past and the terrible things you've said and done, then it shouldn't matter. We know we hurt people--I know I have--and we have to live with that for the rest of our lives, as do they. So, it's good to remember so we never behave that way again; but you don't need to go as far as torturing yourself.

You cannot make everyone happy. Not everyone hates pwBPD. There are so many people who are sympathetic to our issues and wish for our recovery. So many people who believe in us.

Find those subs and read those comments. Find the people who have survived the abuse and aren't destroyed by it and understand that people sometimes fall ill. Sometimes we slip.

Find the people who don't allow themselves to be doormats, but allow us second chances, because they know we're not all monsters...

Fight the urge to spread the flames, fight the urge to punish yourself, and fight against the desire to shut down altogether. Definitely do not act against his decision with anger, because he is hurting.

The world is a strange place and nothing is ever set in stone--not as long as you live. Maybe some time apart is exactly what you both need...? Perhaps you should take this time to better yourself and become the partner you think you should be. . . the partner you would want.

I don't believe in fate, but chance is a comforting thought because in the years to come, once you've found yourself and made peace with the mistakes you've made, maybe then you will find one another again. Maybe then it will work out like you both wished it would have in the beginning. Just don't give up, but also, don't hold him hostage in a relationship in which he is unhappy.

You know the saying, ""if you love him. . ."""
BPD,f7osu9g,t1_f7onoyr,1573933450.0,"You're welcome.

If all he's asked for is some quiet and space, you have to fight the monster within you that is tearing at your insides and screaming that you cannot be alone. You can be. The feeling of jumping out of your skin and negative energy boiling up to your head will eventually pass. So, let him go into the other room or take a drive...

I used to be so insecure I would freak out if my SO simply went to the restroom. When things were unstable between us and I couldn't resolve the issue right in that moment, the feeling intensified. But after taking deep breaths, and actively calming and distracting myself, those feelings subsided.

Not sure exactly what your betrayals or issues are, but regulating your emotions is probably a good place to start. It's made my life easier and my SO is more at peace. His patience is slowly returning because I am able to show him I can overcome these episodes. I am in control.

Good luck to you, friend!"
BPD,f7nz89f,t3_dx50tj,1573917956.0,"You cannot change the past.

All you can do is show your love and devotion--and remorse--through your actions. There will always be the pain of knowing who you were and what you've done, but you can both begin to heal once you no longer do those things. There may be some resentment, but that's part of it. Someone who is hurt or abused gets to decide when they feel safe or comfortable again. . . and you have to accept that and give them time and space. Be more mindful and focus on his emotional needs more than your own because, let's face it, his are probably more rational (at least in my relationship). The past does not define anyone, though, your actions and ability to be present make up who you are.

There are consquences to the guilt you feel. Hold on to it too long and it will destroy you and any chance you have of making things right. You're alive, and that means you can still make things right between you."
BPD,f7l41ef,t3_dwl3jw,1573832297.0,"I do this periodically.

I get a spurt of energy and do something I've not had the motivation for in the past. I say I'll keep doing it because I'm happier than when I was not doing it, but I never do. I pick up hobbies and drop them after a week.

I think about getting better every day, then just. . . don't.

If you find a remedy other than changing perspective, let me know."
BPD,f7l09an,t3_dwmxhg,1573830211.0,"If you truly wish to recover, you will find a way.

The universe is a mysterious and wonderful thing full of innumerable surprises. You never know what the future holds. One year, maybe five years down the road you may have your shit together and you may fatefully be reintroduced into one another's lives when the time is right.

You don't know what is in store for you if you try to get better. What you do know is that if you wallow in the sadness of losing this love, and make no changes due to your misery, you will remain miserable.

You need to distract yourself. If you have friends, talk to them, spend time with them or distract yourself in other ways. Think about you independently, not what you were with this person.

I would gladly offer up my ears if you need to talk to someone who is unbiased. Sending good vibes your way, friend. Remember you're not alone."
BPD,f7kxc86,t3_dworkf,1573828429.0,"Just want to say I'm proud of you for taking a step toward healing and being proactive about your recovery. Sometimes it feels so difficult or even pointless.
This has motivated me to search for some DBT exercises myself.
Thanks! Good vibes your way, my friend."
