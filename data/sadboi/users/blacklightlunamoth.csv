The public schools were only willing to put him with the handicapped kids who couldn't speak or communicate and fully label him as r*****ed and the private schools wanted my single mom to pay a whole additional tuition to accommodate him. My mom struggled with whether ppl should know about his diagnosis because she didn't want others to think less of him.

However, at least in my case, I was expected to care for most of the household duties from a young age, including mothering my older, high functioning autistic brother. So yeah, ""adulting"" is hard.
