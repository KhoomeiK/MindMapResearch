mentalhealth,fp0z2hh,t1_fp0xuu4,1588220224.0,"Aw, You’re welcome. 
Forgive my little soap box though.  I see you’ve run into the self defense mechanism of mental illness. That’s how it defends itself by making us think we don’t deserve it, that others are in worse shape. The illnesses lie to us because like any illness they don’t want to just go away. They make us compare ourselves to the worst examples so that we’ll go “well I guess I’m not THAT bad, I should suck it up.” 

From everything I read -and I think you said it quite well- you do indeed deserve and need help. Especially once you feel like you can’t handle it anymore. My mistake was I tried to power-girl my way through it. All the signs were there but because I wasn’t screaming at telephone poles or cutting myself it meant that I didn’t deserve help. I was constantly comparing myself with those worse off. The best thing I was told after I ended up in hospital was that this “wasn’t some race to the bottom”. I didn’t need to reach some arbitrary number of standard before I became deserving of help. 

It’s not always easy to get help I understand, but you’re mind is worth fighting that battle over. You don’t deserve to have to feel that way and you don’t deserve to fight a scrappy battle with an uncaring illness with one arm tied behind your back. 

I’m sorry, I hope I don’t come off as too preachy. I just know what it’s like and I’m over sensitive since it literally almost killed me."
mentalhealth,fp0vi2u,t3_gao3b8,1588217856.0,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this. It really sucks. I’ve often noticed these things get worse at night. I think it’s because there’s less distraction and our brain is just too tired to fight anymore. For me that’s always when my “voices” would get worse along with my depression and I did not deal well with any of it. I wish I knew some trick but my only relief came from my medication. 

I hope you can get the help you need and deserve. I’m sorry you have to fight this battle."
schizophrenia,fp0uwui,t3_gamws2,1588217475.0,Hugs!
schizophrenia,fp0uvsi,t3_ganka5,1588217456.0,Yessss. I always felt once I left the room people would always talk about me and how I didn’t get it... whatever “it” is.
schizophrenia,fou667l,t1_fou3ud5,1588077235.0,It’s just so tiresome isn’t it?
schizophrenia,fou61nk,t1_fou3ouu,1588077140.0,Aw thanks! 💜💜

Glad you liked the drawing btw. 💜"
schizophrenia,foqjctn,t3_g8zh13,1587994876.0,Yup. They never stop. It’s always swirling around becoming one thing or another.
schizophrenia,fod9o1r,t3_g6v914,1587681981.0,"*waves hand. 
Grimmy here, I got it at 44. It can indeed happen."
schizophrenia,foc4337,t3_g6qx9j,1587666875.0,Apart from hallucinations as a little girl my life was pretty normal up until three years ago when my hallucinations came back at 41. Even then enough other stuff seemed normal that I tried ignoring them and basically tried to change my diet and exercise and outdoor my way out of it. I got my waistline back but other than that it didn’t work out so well for me. My hallucinations increased and towards the middle of last year I started getting paranoid that something was always wrong with me- often some sort of brain parasite or something like that. Shortly after that I finally crawled into my first psychiatrist visit and immediately began to be treated for schizophrenia.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fnr9e2s,t3_g3h1fn,1587182577.0,Really awesome!

schizophrenia,fmw1qn1,t1_fmv4ag2,1586437467.0,I’m so sorry you’ve had to deal with that. You’re very right. It’s not normal at all. You’re dealing with so much!
schizophrenia,fmukze3,t1_fmukkxb,1586393459.0,"Aw you’re so kind. I saw what you had to say and I meant to comment to show that I was walking the walk. I don’t mind if those that have it have found peace and can view their own case as a gift; I just resent others who have no idea what it’s like saying that I should view it as such. You were fine, I was just really pouty last night."
schizophrenia,fmueu6a,t1_fmue7zc,1586390015.0,That’s a very good way of putting it there- it really  is delusional. Well said overall.
schizophrenia,fmue1ry,t1_fmubrm6,1586389571.0,You got that right!
schizophrenia,fmubmy8,t1_fmubi3u,1586388228.0,I’m so sorry you’ve gotta go through that; but I imagine you gotta do what you can.

schizophrenia,fmsdiri,t1_fmsdasg,1586353151.0,Oh. My. Werd. Yes that would be SO unhelpful. Dang. Well glad you shut that down.
schizophrenia,fmsdevr,t1_fmsd3go,1586353083.0,Aw you’re so kind. Most days the comments brush off; other days less so. Luckily at least on social media I’m a little more quick to respond in self defense (less so in real life). Fortunately that’s where most of these exchanges have taken place.
schizophrenia,fmsct6v,t1_fmschc1,1586352688.0,Yes I agree! The condescension ignores the suffering.
schizophrenia,fms9o1f,t1_fms3d9w,1586350511.0,Yeah and that’s a good point. These people have good intentions; they just have lousy insight about the illness.
schizophrenia,fms9g6a,t1_fms1akp,1586350347.0,I know. It just shows they have no idea what it’s really like.
schizophrenia,fms9abr,t1_fms0naa,1586350226.0,That’s exactly how I feel. Thank you. Well said.
schizophrenia,fms932j,t1_fms07g0,1586350076.0,Yup that’s exactly what I’m saying. Well said by you. Thank you.

schizophrenia,fms8hw5,t1_fmrcvp8,1586349636.0,Yes exactly that! That’s not a “gift”. It’s pure torture.
schizophrenia,fms8f8y,t1_fmracya,1586349580.0,Right?
schizophrenia,fms8b3f,t1_fmr9v6g,1586349491.0,"So nice of you to say, thank you. And hopefully this weekend."

And that’s actually really cool of you."
schizophrenia,fmr3dmf,t1_fmr32lc,1586312941.0,So very well said. And with a lot to back it up.
schizophrenia,fmqzbor,t1_fmqz8pz,1586310334.0,Really I think that’s the best way. My problem is I have a big blabbing mouth.
schizophrenia,fmqz0g6,t1_fmqyyao,1586310143.0,Probably it was just as well you did.
schizophrenia,fmqyyi0,t1_fmqyo5g,1586310110.0,Yes exactly. Thank you!
schizophrenia,fmqywll,t1_fmqxqbe,1586310078.0,My. Word. No. Just I can’t even handle that. Not sure how you did.
schizophrenia,fmqsnnk,t1_fmqsiq3,1586306196.0,Thank you so much for that. Even this has been helpful with making me feel supported. Your kindness means a lot.
schizophrenia,fmqs3jt,t1_fmqs0cx,1586305856.0,Thank you so much. I’m sure it’s just for the evening.

schizophrenia,fmqqj7d,t3_fwvwl3,1586304911.0,"I have to take some deep calming breaths because it’s happening to me right now. It’s kind of like a radio in my head on one hand but it also feels like another presence is there just warping me and taking my brain and twisting it. The voices and thoughts just take over everything and become louder than my thoughts.  

I don’t know if that even makes sense."
schizophrenia,fmqohym,t1_fmqoc8w,1586303704.0,Oh my word. Yes. Well said.
schizophrenia,fmql27u,t3_fwuq79,1586301718.0,I suspected that I was both coming down with it and probably had it for longer than I realized.
schizophrenia,fmqksag,t3_fwrgr2,1586301564.0,I usually can with my visual hallucinations- they tend to move inhumanly fast and border on ridiculous or bizarre. It’s much harder with my auditory hallucinations.

schizophrenia,fmn6z4q,t3_fwagwy,1586219514.0,I know the feeling. But I assure you it’s not. This illness is so good at fooling us into thinking it is.
schizophrenia,fml2v58,t3_fvxbz1,1586177150.0,"It definitely could be a type of hallucination, a fair amount of mine would go away when I looked directly at them (though definitely not all). What you described is enough that I probably would tell my doctor or psychiatrist. Just to be safe."

What’s worse is it can make people like you and me feel guilty for even trying to get help because there’s someone “worse off” or some shit like that. But this isn’t a race to the bottom. I don’t need to reach some low before I need or even deserve help."
schizophrenia,flm4wsg,t3_fpns0q,1585274652.0,"I mean you could be quirky, but if those “quirks” are causing you negative experiences then you deserve to feel better. I don’t like gate keeping, and I’m not a doctor, but you might just check in with a doctor concerning those hallucinations. Some people might say “those are normal hypnogogic hallucinations” I say let a doctor tell you that instead of internet experts. I understand your possible confusion with wondering how you could possibly be schizophrenic (I’ll just say it) and yet be ok at being social; but again that may just need a doctor to examine and go through. Despite my schizophrenia I’m still able to chat it up (albeit with a lot more effort since I became ill) and appear socially able. 

Mental illness can be just that varied. And you may be absolutely fine. Just quirky. But you deserve the peace of mind that can come with knowing. And if you do have an illness, having attention called to it early on can give you a better shot at recovery. 

Best of luck!"
schizophrenia,flm3nmv,t1_flm1uwl,1585273826.0,"Not too personal at all. I think what helped me to be able to believe him was two connected things; my schizophrenia was late onset, and I’d been married to him for 17 years so I’d build up a lot of trust. If there was a third thing it was how gentle he was when he told me. He calmly reminded me of all that I’d been through and helped me connect the dots. 

This probably isn’t that helpful to you though, and I’m so sorry. I wonder if in this case maybe your friend doesn’t need to hear it from his family but may indeed need to hear it from a friend. Sometimes it just goes like that. Honestly since I view my husband as my trusted friend I think that helped. I wonder how I would’ve reacted if say it had been my father or brother who told me."

Occasionally I get what feels like a big spider crawling on me; the first time I felt it I freaked out and ran to a restroom to rip my shirt off real quick- only to find nothing.

You honestly should talk to a doctor while you’re so aware of it not being real.  It’ll be easier for them to work with you and most likely if they see you’re aware they won’t try to send you to a hospital. But the point overall is that you need and deserve help.
