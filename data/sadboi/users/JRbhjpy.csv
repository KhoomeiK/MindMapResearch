ptsd,faq8ca2,t3_ea8ohm,1576299394.0,"If you’re in America this is against the ADA (Americans with disabilities act) treating her as if her illness isn’t real and not accommodating her the way she needs. If they have always treated her like this or continue to treat her this way with such little respect they can be taken to court over this. 

Seriously, if you’re in the US refresh the principals memory of this act and I’m sure she won’t have problems anymore unless the school wants a lawsuit."

If you can’t pass it once, let alone twice, that’s ridiculous and your own fault as a grown adult."
AmItheAsshole,f3f9m5j,t1_f3dblgj,1570892877.0,"She’s a 21 year old adult. Time to grow up and learn how to study simple things like road signs and how to turn your high beams on. 

She had her chance to learn this basic knowledge and earn the car, and she didn’t. Your 16yo was responsible, studied, and had the drive (haha, get it?) to learn all of these things in a reasonable time manner. 

OP, you’re NTA. It sounds like your 21yo still has some growing up to do."
raisedbynarcissists,f2oba0v,t3_ddmbkr,1570325550.0,"Absolutely incredible the lengths narcissists will go to feel they have power and control over people and their lives. 

I was in a coma because of my mother. At 15 I caught the swine flu (not aware, thought it was a stomach virus) and being a type 1 diabetic this can really mess up my blood sugar. She refused to bring me to a doctor because she thought I was faking for attention and that I was fine. I woke her up a week into being sick  one night telling her I needed to go to the hospital so she gave me water and a blanket and told me to go back to bed. 

My parents woke up that morning and I was in a coma from diabetic shock. She still didn’t want my dad to call an ambulance despite my condition. I was 91 degrees when I got to the hospital, I was so severely dehydrated they had to airlift me to a CHOP because the vein specialists at my local hospital couldn’t find any veins. 

They said if I came in one day later I would’ve died. 
She never visited me at the hospital. 
She never apologized. 

Nmoms don’t care about anyone but themselves, especially in circumstances where the spotlight is on anyone but them. 

I’m so happy you are able to take legal action against her, she should be no where near a hospital or sick patients if this is how she abuses her power as a head nurse. 

Wishing you and your husband luck with the legal process and praying for your nmom to get her ass whooped in court :)"
raisedbynarcissists,f1d1kpo,t1_f1cjdae,1569371475.0,"After going NC I was able to start seeing therapists/psychiatrists and was diagnosed with PTSD, chronic depression and generalized anxiety, all stemming from my nmom growing up. Going NC changes everything, it’s the only solution when dealing with narcissists! So so awesome you were able to find happiness after their abuse :) stay strong and don’t let them try and slither their way back into your life!"
raisedbynarcissists,f1d1bxb,t1_f1ccawn,1569371290.0,"They do but at least we can find happiness! My nmom will never be happy, no one will worship her the way she craves. I’ve been NC for 3 years and since then I’ve been the happiest I’ve been in my entire life. Congratulations on going NC! :)"
raisedbynarcissists,f1bw2o1,t1_f1b3b9c,1569344261.0,"My mother tried, and continues to try, to poison the well. I was lucky to understand she was an nmom at a very early age. Every instance of abuse from 11+ I audio and video recorded, so now she’s the one with no friends, family, or children that love her. 

She still likes to blame me, tells people how I make things up and lie about her ( I don’t live with her anymore so I don’t have the means to record anything). But with years of proof of her behind closed doors it is impossible for her to even try to lie, but of course as nmoms do, she tries anyways. 

No regrets here either :) just a sad girl with a plethora of life long issues from an insane person.

ETA: I’ve been NC for almost 3 years."
AmItheAsshole,eyqtsxl,t3_cy9jf6,1567353376.0,"NTA. I was a freshman last year with a similar situation with one of my roomates, something that really helped was my RA. She was super respectful of everyone’s feelings and helped to create a lot of solutions to the problems we were having and the rest of the school year went pretty smoothly. If an RA is available to you I highly recommend getting their guidance as it’s their job that they’re trained to do!"

I have no where else to take him besides another shelter, which I would feel morally horrible about and I have already become very attached to him as well.

AskWomen,epbkwxn,t3_bubdqq,1559144010.0,"My great aunt has three children, two of which (26f, 28m) have been addicted to drugs for 10+ years. Earlier last year one of them (28m)  got clean, then this past October started again, OD’d, and died. The other cousin (26f) is still addicted to drugs and prostitutes herself out for drug money. It never tore the family apart but it didn’t have a positive effect either, it’s just something we’re all aware of but have realized there’s nothing else more we can do to help her if she doesn’t WANT to get clean. 

My mom, on the other hand, is an alcoholic. She tore the family apart in multiple ways, she kicked me out when I was 16 because my school counselor reported her to CPS. Then she filed a fake PFA with a women’s place to get my dad kicked out of the house. This is on top of cheating on him multiple times in the house, one of the incidents I actually walked in on when I was 15. She slept with her little sisters husband while her sister was pregnant with her first child, and had little to no relationship with any of the family anymore for more reasons. But, alas, karma is making its rounds and since the house was bought before her and my dad were married he’s entitled to the whole house, which she now has to buy him out of (over 300k) with her salary that’s about 30k a year. My siblings (12m, 11f, 11f) are abused now in the same ways I was and are currently going through the process to live with my dad full time. Addiction in my family has done nothing but harm, but in the end it’s the addict who’s hurt the worst."
relationship_advice,ep1sotv,t3_btr5l0,1558995177.0,"Spare both yours and your girlfriends feelings and break up with her. If you truly want to be involved with another woman while currently in a relationship then the relationship isn’t worth it, even if you don’t open up about how you feel with this other girl. 

Also if this girl is clearly happy in her relationship with her boyfriend you shouldn’t try and come between them and hurt multiple people in the process, including yourself. 

But, if you think there’s hope for the two of you and she’s shown interest, have an honest conversation about it with her and if it goes well please make sure you’re both single before getting emotionally / physically involved."
astrology,eokgwsg,t1_eojvska,1558654370.0,Yes! My boyfriends moon sign is the same as my sun sign and he was the first person ever in my life that I instantly clicked with and had a deep connection with.
