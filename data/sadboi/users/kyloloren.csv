StonerPhilosophy,fj04hp2,t3_fasjl8,1582888666.0,"The infinite that you mentioned i like to think like a box inside a box inside a box and that last box is the first box. You know? Like the form of the universe that you can't tell when it stars or ends, a toroid. And it makes me think that all forms of life is working together to be this one life that we're experiencing individualy, so it's just like a unique universe that has no limits but the parts finds eachother in a vicius and mysterious way. I don't know. I don't get why and how we can mark when it begins and it ends (like birth and death) if we can't understand this concept in a big way like imagining the universe and in a small way like atoms and eletrons etc. So it got me thinking if this life is in some way just a constant (whatever it is)"
AlanWatts,fizmgku,t3_fanpu8,1582866976.0,You need to separate what is your ego and what you are really made off. What of this is the composition of the reality you're living and what is an invention of the self.

AlanWatts,f9oln8d,t1_f9okgog,1575507650.0,"it's really good :)

sometimes when i think about life i have this knowledge that i can not put in word so fast as i thought of it, that i cannot express it right through. but in some way, i know it all makes sense, and it keeps me going. it's a beautiful feeling. maybe it is what i saw in other post here, about knowing ""it"". you just know. the moment you try to define ""it"", it fades away."
AlanWatts,f9og46c,t3_e65t8k,1575503736.0,"i really think drugs can lead you to a epiphany and that it could have happened to you, so yes, it's all real. you felt it. you know it. don't put it too much on the drug use, it's a doubt you shouldn't listen to, cause it doesn't matter, after all. some people might have had it other ways.

the coolest thing about it is once you have it, you don't feel the need to use it again because you achieved what you were looking for. you know it's allright because you could know it all for a second and that's all that counts. and now you can see it, more than anything.

i'm very happy for you.

so, to your question, maybe this is the meaning to it all, yeah. trust it."

AlanWatts,f83yruy,t3_dys92u,1574224825.0,I really don't know. But i think it is hapiness in a pure way. Is to fall in love with the experience of a human being beyond yours. It's to accept you're not alone in this world after all. It's not feeling lonely. And i think it's a beautiful feeling to have.
