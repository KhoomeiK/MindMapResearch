Even my mom told me and I quote: ""You really don't wanna get out of this depression?""

Sad thing is probably most people have this mentality, but hey at least you'll know who's who and what's what and in the end you'll have a bit more stable image of yourself and who you are and what kind of people you want to have around you. Definitely not like the ones that I quoted above.

I have read that the soundstage is not as big as the others but everything else is spot on. They would be my first audiophile headphones so I don't think that will bother me that much even though I don't plan on buying any other headphones. 
I tried the momentum in-ear trully wireless before but had to return them because they were too uncomfortable but they did sound amazing, especially for in-ear headphones.

Music will be my mainly use for them, edm, deep house, lo-fi, jazz, classic, sometimes some alternative rock like Coldplay or Muse. Maybe try them out for gaming as well, probably end up using them more for that based on how much I will like them.

Thank you, very interesting read.
