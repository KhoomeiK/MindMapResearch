Now I am taking what is considered a‚Äùmedical food‚Äù, although it comes in a capsule, and must be Dr. prescribed: Levomefolate/Algae-S: Deplin 7.5 mg per day. June was such a disaster, it was just terrible. By July, I was much better and have been stable ever since, the longest amount of months in a row EVER! Some of you might want to look into it, although as I said, ketamine is extremely expensive and insurance won‚Äôt cover it because it is not yet FDA approved, even though it has been used for anesthesia and pain since 1969. It‚Äôs been a long haul and I hope this continues to work. Although some doctors say bad things about ketamine infusions, I have been doing it for 1 1/2 years with NO side effects. Just had physical. Passed with flying colors. Sorry I wrote a novella here! My husband did try turning some ketamine receipts in to insurance, but got back only a small amount."

AmItheAsshole,f7ap8wo,t3_dupigb,1573535392.0,"NTA I‚Äôm 60 (F) and grew up with ADHD when there was no name for it or any medications. People/teachers just thought I could be a big pain in the butt talking too much, interrupting all the time and lack of focus. Eventually, my psych. diagnosed me along with bipolar (which sometimes mimics ADHD with hypomania. But it is different.) I never mention either disorder. I have found that for the most part, people don‚Äôt believe adults have ADHD (which never goes away). As far as my bipolar goes, Other than immediate trustworthy family and friends, I never tell anyone. No matter what you hear, it still has a terrible stigma that isn‚Äôt going to go away anytime soon. Sadly."

I got my cat Sage when he was two from PetSmart. He is the best cat ever! He is 4 1/2 now. He brings so much happiness to my life. If you don‚Äôt want to go directly to a shelter, go to these stores and support their adoption program!"

He used to whistle tunelessly just to get on my nerves. Now I totally lose control over leaf blowers, lawn mowers and tree trimming. I live in a neighborhood where it literally goes on for hours, and I can‚Äôt get away from it. Use sound-cancelling headphones frequently, but sometimes need earplugs as well. We have double-paned windows. Panic, extreme anger... I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt wait to get those headphones on fast enough. My sympathies to all! It‚Äôs awful!!! üëÇNTA"
AmItheAsshole,f77rwpb,t3_dumajw,1573473106.0,"I can see I‚Äôm the only NTA one here. I believe it is never a good idea to reward bad behavior. It forms a precedent and a pattern that throwing a tantrum will get whatever you want. I still remember taking my 6-year-old son to the now defunct Toys Are Us. I was rewarding him for an ‚ÄúA‚Äù on a spelling test. We went in to get a Batman toy and he threw a huge tantrum, crying and carrying on because he wanted two. I calmly said to pick ONE. If he did well on test next week, he could get the other one. He still kept crying loudly and making a big deal of it. So I took him by the hand and calmly walked out of the store. He is much older now, and actually thanks me for teaching him that lesson."

He gives her his lower number, after already waiting quite awhile. Then a huge bruiser comes in the door, that she referred to as ‚Äúbaby‚Äù. George lost his spot and waited around for a long time until the number they exchanged finally came up. That‚Äôs what many jerks out there try to pull. (At motor vehicle.)"
AmItheAsshole,f77nd2h,t3_duk0s1,1573465914.0,"I got married in 1988 with a very simple, very elegant dress. It is timeless. Nevertheless, I would never ask my daughter to wear it. It was my style, and she is her own unique woman. If she asked, I would say to try it on, see what she thinks. Haven‚Äôt looked at my dress in a long time, but sometimes white turns yellowish as it ages. If she wants her own style, she could sensitively tell her mom, that looking through bridal magazines, there might be some other styles she is interested in. Good luck and love happily ever after!"

AmItheAsshole,f6vz021,t3_dsxwss,1573208528.0,"I can‚Äôt believe no one has any sympathy for someone making a mistake like that. Every day I drive around my neighborhood or see posters or online that a family‚Äôs cat or dog is missing. I live in an area where people keep their cats inside and dogs on a leash. Still they escape and go missing because someone ACCIDENTALLY left a door open, unlatched, or the animal jumped out of the car in the driveway and took off. I also had horses from about age 10 to 20. As someone else mentioned, one opened a latch by herself and got into the hay. I was up with her all night. Parents should have stressed, and made a big issue to the kids about locking and double checking the gate. This whole thing is a terrible tragedy, but is the whole family going to ostracize and act like they don‚Äôt love Carl anymore? It is so horrible to lose a horse. I have and was devastated. But 14 is still just a child, whether folks want to admit it or not. Let daughter decide if she wants Opie and for punishment, make Carl clean the stall. Don‚Äôt act like you don‚Äôt love him anymore. As sad as this is, Carl‚Äôs whole life will be affected by the way this is being handled. Much love and sympathy for daughter. Maybe Carl could write her a letter expressing to her how bad he feels that this happened."
