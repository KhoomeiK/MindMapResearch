It's sad that she seems to have lost a lot of passion for makeup, but I think that's inevitable when you indulge yourself constantly. The PET glitter thing is a bizarre and arbitrary restriction that gives her a way to feel involved in her purchases. When it comes down to it, the microplastics aren't ethical, the shipping isn't ethical, the mica mined by child slaves/workers is not ethical (and is probably the most egregious of them all, but white people care more about ducks than brown children, because of course they do). And the worst part is that you, me, LMB, anyone, doesn't need makeup. It's not a need. And if it was, LMB and most of the people in makeup internet circles have enough to stop buying cold turkey for years to come. But it's our escapism, it's what we're *supposed* to do, our prole lottery without even the promise of the jackpot. How did we get here? 

Fuck off with your worrying about ethical makeup purchases online and, idk, read theory. Watch The Good Place. Talk to human people. Etc."
muacirclejerk,fr4luyc,t1_fr4jqpb,1589891749.0,"What the fuck is her deal with being so conscientious of not buying PET glitter but still being subscribed to boxycharm or whatever even though she literally never likes the stuff? It really bugs me, it’s so holier than thou. If something I want has PET glitter in it I’m still gonna buy it, because I buy like one thing every six months. Do you really think my purchasing of PET glitter once every six months is more detrimental than being subscribed to multiple monthly beauty boxes? 

The ethical thing is so annoying because it’s such a privileged stance. Most people in America don’t buy new shit all the time, and then they buy stuff from Walmart/F21/H&M because it’s what they can afford. If you wanna be ethical, stop buying shit you don’t need! And spoiler, you don’t need any of it.

books,fr32857,t1_fr1ssuu,1589848468.0,"I think it’s because Holden, and to some extent the novel itself, never really questions or examines that self-centeredness. Holden is supposed to be a flawed character, but I think his ego is presented as honesty and not as his primary flaw. I’ve noticed this in a few books written from the first person perspective of a depressed teenage boy. I just read Ned Vizzini’s It’s Kind of a Funny Story and he basically says it outright — something to the effect of “we [boys] tend to have things easier than girls and therefore we assume the world was built for us and that we’re the culmination of everything that came before us.”

Catcher is just one of many pieces of media that legitimizes a straight white male’s depression itself as art and delegitimizes anyone else’s struggles in the process. If you too were a straight white male I see how that could be gratifying but for the rest of us it simply reads as privilege and ego. Catcher may be potent as a character study and insight into how Holden and his sort of type of person thinks, but I will never find it personally touching or engaging."

books,fr1fxmd,t3_gm21lt,1589819037.0,"The psyche? I don't think Orwell wrote 1984 to investigate Winston's psyche. It's not a character driven novel and Winston, to my interpretation, is ultimately unimportant to the novel's message.

I think 1984 is best read as an investigation into the theory of how language controls our thinking. The goal of The Party is to create a society where there cannot be even the possibility of dissenting thought. In my interpretation, the idea of ""totalitarianism"" takes a back seat to the far more applicable discussion of the use of language. 

Compared to many other dystopian novels, it's not well-written. If you try to read it the way you'd read those novels you won't enjoy it. It was written as anti-Soviet material post-World War II and it has a very clear and direct goal and any character driven storylines are simply a tool to achieve that goal. Again, if you read it for that, you won't enjoy it."

The fact is that those actions can never be taken back, no amount of torturing him will repair her or make her not have gone through that, there is no cosmic balance scale that can or will make his life worse and her life better. It depends on your point of view: should prison be primarily punishment, a place to keep criminals away from other people, or a place to rehabilitate? You can believe that someone is helpless and fatally flawed and the idea of anything other than torture is useless, but in the end it’s not a zero sum game. I’m not telling you what to think, just trying to explain my position further. 

But remember for every one of these extreme and terrible and apparently senseless crimes, there are thousands of nonviolent offenders and victims of the system who suffer from people who think that prison should be punishment because they think of people like this man when they think of prison. It’s a complex issue. Prisons that put actual effort into rehabilitation see much, much lower rates of recidivism. But the power structure that would be willing to torture this man would be willing to torture a lot of other people with crimes that are much less severe — there won’t be a gritty, abusive prison existing alongside one that focuses on rehabilitation, something that would be tangibly beneficial to a lot more people.

what did she do? very curious.

Also, my skin is definitely dry and it will also appear oily at the end of the day. I don't think that that's that uncommon (triple that score?)"

Gymnastics,fnr9pyp,t1_fnr6oii,1587182823.0,"From Wikipedia:

> One month after the 1992 Olympics Mitova received a serious neck injury while training on a trampoline. She was paralyzed, but partly regained mobility after a series of surgeries. [...] She then returned to Bulgaria and immigrated to the United States, where she married Artie Hutchinson and changed her last name. Currently she runs the Silvia’s Gymnastics gym in Pennsylvania, together with her husband and parents.

Seems like things worked out ok for her! But it is always important for us to see how ruthless this sport is, I think, both physically and mentally."
