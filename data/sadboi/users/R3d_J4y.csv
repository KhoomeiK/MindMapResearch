Do what you need to do to get better. When you start getting better things will clear up again. Don’t beat yourself up over not being as capable now. You can get back. 

For me the fogginess has been on and off. Getting better isn’t a straight line, but it is possible. Use all the tools available to you. Continue therapy. Try medication or change medications if it isn’t working. I highly recommend mindfulness exercises for defogging as well.

SaltLakeCity,flvbdj2,t3_fr6jv9,1585520273.0,"These laws are damaging to women everywhere. The truth is laws like this put women’s life at risk. Even if the law allows for medical exceptions, taking away elective abortion is a danger to women’s health. This includes women with planned pregnancies. There is precedent in other states with restrictive abortion laws where women have been held back from abortions because the status of their health had not degraded enough even though continuing an impossible pregnancy would cause organs to die and place their life in a precarious situation. 

Even if the pregnancy itself doesn’t directly put a life at risk it can threaten lives. Many medications taken for mental health problems can cause birth defects. These medications can be the difference between life or death for some people. These aren’t the only medications that can’t be used when a woman is pregnant that would severely impact their health or quality of life.

These laws are not written by healthcare professionals. These laws are not written by the woman who need to face the health related risks that come with pregnancy. The people writing these laws do not take into account the well-being of the female population. 

As a woman with a condition that would make pregnancies high risk this terrifies me. Abortions are healthcare."

As someone else in Utah I hope it gives you comfort that Utah has been handling the outbreak well. The actions Utah is taking is not because the outbreak is out of control. The actions Utah is taking is preemptive. Utah has taken precautions earlier than other states and we only have 5 confirmed cases so far. The virus will most likely spread, but the best thing that can be done is to delay it. The situation is bad in areas like Italy and China because of how fast the virus spread. Fast spreading causes overburdened health care systems. Even if your dad catches the virus, because of Utah’s early action, he will have a better chance of survival because our hospitals will not be overburdened. 

Im sorry you are going through this. If you need someone to talk to I’m a good listener. You can just PM me. I have confidence that you and your dad will get through this. 

It is frightening and it is ok to be afraid. Take all the time you need to process this fear, because it is not all bad. You are afraid because you want to protect your dad and that’s a good thing. Do what you need to do to keep your dad safe. After processing that fear and taking action, take some time to trust the system. There are people working all around the globe to help save and protect people like your dad.

anxietysuccess,fj5140m,t3_fbi7r8,1583021718.0,"The difficult thing is that the ball will be in their court. You can’t fix them, but you can guide them and make it easier to make the decisions needed to get better.

The most important thing you can do is focus on your own mental health. You can’t help them if you are not well yourself. If they sense you are already off it is harder for them to be open about pretty much anything. To be able to help they can’t feel bad about leaning on you or being able to go to you for help when they are having a bad day. There are support groups for those helping significant others with mental illnesses if you find that you need support for yourself. Mental illness hurts everyone. Please take care of yourself.

Keep healthy boundaries.

Make it easier to get help. Anxiety makes everything more difficult. Try to help them find a therapist, eat healthy, get out of the house, get exercise, and maybe seek medication. Don’t force anything, just help make the obstacles smaller. You can be a gym buddy. Cook healthy food. Call doctors or therapists for them (with their permission). Go to appointments with them. Etc.

Be someone they can communicate with. With my experience when others haven’t dealt with anxiety they become frustrated  when the anxiety sufferer isn’t able to do the things that seem simple. Even if you have experienced anxiety, people experience anxiety in different ways. It is important to come to terms that things aren’t going to make 100% sense. And that’s perfectly fine. You two are different people. When the anxiety gets in the way and it’s frustrating don’t get impatient. Try not to get frustrated. Understand that they are a different person and they play by a different set of rules. Observe their behavior without judgement and help them find solutions so they don’t struggle in the future. People can’t shame themselves better. I can guarantee they know their anxiety is not normal and because of that it can be difficult to discuss. You need to make sure you are someone they feel comfortable discussing these topics with. They need to be able to bring up their problems without fear of judgement. A mind is a dangerous place to travel alone. Other people can provide clarity and insight because they are able to see things from an outside perspective."

I’ve gotten pretty good at handling religion if it comes up. The best way to avoid awkward, divisive conversations is to be open about what you agree with and demonstrate that you are not completely against their beliefs. 

For me I say I’m not religious, but I’m spiritual and I find pieces of beauty and wisdom in every religion. I’m ok with some religious talk. I enjoy learning about others viewpoints and if you do it right you can have some interesting conversations. If you are comfortable with some religious talk you can go into some of your beliefs that are in alignment with theirs so that it is easier to guide them away from topics you would rather not discuss. 

There will always be people who are not respectful of your beliefs and if they can’t accept your beliefs and only want to convert you, make firm boundaries about what you are comfortable discussing if you want to continue to be friends. If they can’t accept your boundaries, it may be for the best to move on."

I spent a week in the hospital and I’m lucky I’m insured. The bill was $160,000 and I just paid my deductible. Blood clots are emergencies that require the emergency room and you got lucky you caught it before it became more serious. Had they determined your clot was more severe you would have needed to pay a whole lot more. Had you gone somewhere else and the clot was severe enough you could have died.

Besides 2,500 for the emergency room actually isn’t too terrible.... it would be difficult to find a trip to the Er costing less than that."
selfcare,fg73r44,t3_exa56r,1580583300.0,"The anxiety is too much for your friend to handle. You can still stay friends she just wants to set a healthy boundary. Your friend feels helpless. While you know that she can talk you down all she sees is your attacks and they don’t appear to be stopping. It is difficult for people who haven’t experienced anxiety disorders or haven’t dedicated their careers to studying anxiety disorders to understand what’s going on. She is in a situation where she feels powerless. It is healthy for her to set a little distance.

I can’t imagine what you must be feeling right now. It is hard to show that vulnerability to someone and have them leave. Mental health issues are difficult to talk about. It must have been difficult opening up to her and it hurts that she will no longer be in the position to support you in those difficult times. Don’t give up on the vulnerability. Don’t let this discourage you from seeking help from others. You need a community. It isn’t fair to put it all on one persons shoulders, but  if you open up to and ask for help from others it is easier.

It might be best to make an appointment with a therapist and your doctor. If you struggle with that I’m sure if you contacted your friend saying that you are searching for a healthier way to manage your anxiety and that you need a little help making an appointment she would want to help you. She has been with you this long. She cares about you and she wants you to be better. Medication and therapy are great. Even if you are scared it is at least worth a try.

We can’t control anxiety, but anxiety can be managed.

You might not be able to fully get rid of it, but you can learn to manage it. It is important to remember that what you feel know isn’t going to be what you feel forever.

Some days we are going to feel like shit and it’s ok to feel like shit. Give yourself the space to process your emotions from this uncomfortable news.

When I started trying to get better I made checklists to go through everyday. That was a bit of a mistake. I got anxious about completing everything and beat myself up about not doing everything. It has helped to use the self care list if I’m in a really bad spot. Just running through it and finding something I haven’t done and doing it at that moment. 

Therapy is great. If you aren’t already in therapy or if you’re broke or too anxious to do it just send me a message and I could help you sort it out.

For me running helps. If it gets bad enough that I’m not functioning I know I just need to drop everything and head to the gym. Yoga is great as well.

I like to carry grounding kits in my purse or backpack. Find something crinkly to focus on the sound. Find some small non perishable food item to focus on the taste. Find something that has a strong smell you like. Finally add something small but soft to focus your sense of touch on. Mine has peanut butter packets, tissues, tissue paper, and peppermint oil. I also carry around a small sketchbook to doodle if I’m struggling to get my head in order.

Everything is going to be about baby steps. Just focus on being better than yesterday and be better tomorrow than you were today. It’s ok to not be perfect right now. You will have bad days but you will also have good days.

Anxiety,f82l7zc,t1_f8228cv,1574193397.0,"Online therapy can help if she is a little hesitant as well or you can offer to go with her. I know better help has a chat feature so if she would feel more comfortable communicating with some more distance and more time to think about responses it might help and when she is comfortable she can move on to phone sessions.

Also make sure you are taking care of yourself. Helping someone with mental illness can be difficult and you can’t help her if you are struggling yourself. There are support groups for spouses of people with mental illnesses and you may get a little better information about how to help from others who are in the same position.

Im on the other side. I’m the anxious one and I know when my husband gets too connected with my anxious state it gets more difficult. I get anxiety about letting him down or disappointing him. It can make it harder to communicate what can help. If you are worried about her or stressed about her condition she can feel it and feed off of it. You can’t change her, but what you can do is give her resources and be there when she needs your help. A lot of getting better is going to be on her shoulders and she will need to move at her own pace.

I got seriously ill and it was really rough getting over the feeling that I could die at anytime. It might be a little different for you, but I had to relearn how to trust my body. I used yoga and running to get reacquainted with my body. I learned how to connect the aches and pains with their causes and came to a place where I know how to trust my body without over or under panicking.

In a way it almost turned into something beautiful. A million things could go wrong with our bodies, but everyday a million things go right and even when something goes wrong our bodies can recover. If something is wrong it won’t be the end of the world we are capable of recovering. 

If you have an ache, acknowledge it as a symptom of your body fixing something. If the ache continued thank your body for letting you know that it needs some rest to recover. If it gets worse after acknowledging it go to the doctor to give your body the best chance at healing itself."
Anxiety,f6r43i0,t3_dsovy5,1573093206.0,"I’ve had similar issues. Honestly I’ve gotten better from learning another language.

I have family members on my husband’s side who don’t speak English. I have found that when speaking in a foreign language my mind enters that anxious space where I am panicking and don’t know what to say or mess up what I say. However, people are VERY supportive and excited when you are learning a language to be able to understand them. 

When learning a language You don’t have to worry about people looking at you funny or treating you like you are a weirdo. You learn to think through what you can say while under anxious pressure. You start with very basic small phrases and build it up. It is ok to mess up and people are very understanding when you do. It is the perfect safe space to get over that piece of anxiety."

AmItheAsshole,f4s6712,t3_dlgm96,1571774808.0,"YTA If you don’t confront them directly. I was almost evicted because a neighbor falsely accused me of smoking pot in our apartment when I don’t smoke nor do I even drink. I have never smoked pot in my life. My husband and I had to deal with complaints over a couple months. I had to spend several weeks sorting out everything with the landlord after I spent a week seriously ill in the hospital. No one should have to worry about becoming homeless when they can barely walk. It turns out the pot smell came from her boyfriend smoking in their apartment. They announced it to the entire complex when they had a very loud break up outside their apartment. 

You better be 100% certain it’s them and have irrefutable proof before taking drastic steps. If they are innocent you are threatening their home and their sense of security."

If you don’t like it you can stop, but if it works and the side effects aren’t too terrible it can make things a lot easier. Medication won’t work for everyone and if it doesn’t work for you that is perfectly fine. I’ve tried two medications. The first one did nothing, but the second one is life changing. I don’t feel like a zombie, I just get sweaty and I can live with that. I was reluctant to take medication, but I’m glad I did because it is life changing.

All I want to say is that it is worth at least trying. You could be one of the lucky ones who can take medication and feel better. If the side effects are bad you can try a different one. If medications don’t work you have at least narrowed down the options of what will or will not work for you."

If you are in the US some places will offer a sliding scale. You might be able to find mental health centers that specifically work with low income individuals. It might take some time to get an appointment though. Online counseling can be an option. It is typically cheaper than in office and some can offer sliding scale for low income individuals as well. You can check for free support groups in your area. NAMI is a great resource. just try finding their local office on nami.org and they can help you with many resources"

AskReddit,eyjsqfj,t1_eyizzf4,1567127237.0,"The key here is that teenagers are specifically mentioned. You can make doctors visits free, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it will be accessible to teenagers whose parents don’t want them on birth control will be able to waltz down to a doctors appointment or pick up a prescription without their parents knowledge. The programs that expand accessibility that I have read about give me some cause for concern. Depending on where you live you may be able to get a prescription from a filling out forms provided by a pharmacist with special certification or through online telemedicine. And just a reminder that if given to the wrong person these medications can be deadly and there are many benefits to regular screenings that are done in doctors offices during visits to obtain birth control. These are medications that are not over the counter for a reason. There is a trade off on accessibility and safety that needs to be considered. Some steps in the processes may limit accessibility, but they are there to save lives."
AskReddit,eyit2lz,t1_eyhjhqi,1567107199.0,"Free and accessible birth control in theory is a good idea, but it is necessary to have some restrictions. Birth control pills are not completely harmless. From personal experience I can tell you that birth control pills can have life threatening effects if you are unlucky. I believe doctor visits are necessary to filter out those who are at most risk of the dire effects of birth control. I know this makes it more difficult for teenage young girls to gain access, but the potential harm cannot be taken lightly. Also it is important that people can be educated on using pills properly, what can prevent them from working as they should, and that pills won’t protect agains STDs.

DebateAnAtheist,eyeo4zm,t1_eyeiw54,1567036538.0,"Im agnostic atheist so I don’t get the whole there is no possible way god exists part. I don’t believe there’s a god but I don’t think it’s impossible. But living as an atheist I do understand why someone would make a hard opposing stance. Being atheist can be isolating especially when living in super religious communities. It is polarizing. It feels like there is no middle ground. You chose one side or the other. And if someone ends up leaving religion after zealously worshipping for years they want to go the other way to the extreme no god side. You can’t provide definitive proof that god does or does not exist in some form. The urge to go hardline either side on the issue I think is more political. If I could provide irrefutable evidence of gods existence or lack of existence I’m certain 70% of people would be accept it.

About the whole science argument, first just because something is called a hypothesis doesn’t mean there is no evidence and they are not meant to be proven. Hypothesises are made to be refined. They are explanations that fit all current information and they evolve as our knowledge evolves. And about there being no proof there is proof in that it is possible with our current knowledge."
TooAfraidToAsk,eyek4s6,t3_cwn4za,1567034907.0,"The biggest issue I see is how do we get there and how much will the government have control over the cost of care like insurance companies already do.

Healthcare is one of the largest and fastest growing industries in the United States. It is loaded with cash and corruption which is a dangerous combination. Healthcare companies have enormous political clout. Politicians want jobs and in many states health care is the biggest employer. They are essentially too big to fail. Wipe them out or making drastic changes would cause dire consequences to the worldwide economy.

Also it would go against the viewpoints of many people. Just to think of a few: what about abortion care, what about the healthy people paying for the poor decisions of others, and some religions are against transplants and blood transfusions.

Health insurance companies hire hundreds of thousands of people. CEOs will not be the only people harmed. Changing the system will harm many lives and government healthcare jobs won’t be able to absorb all of them. 

Doctors and nurses would likely be impacted as well. We already have a doctor and nurse shortage and people are currently not getting the treatment they need. If the barrier of cost is removed we would put more strain on an already strained system. Eventually preventative care would help prevent more serious long term health problems, but there would definitely an increased demand. Hiring more doctors would also be a challenge. Educating new doctors takes years and there are many barriers to bringing in doctors from other countries. Nurse Practitioners could help relieve some of the strain. However, there are limitations to how many nurse practitioners that can work per doctor. 

Then there is the question about how much control would the government have over an individuals healthcare decisions. It is already a pain trying to convince health insurance companies that procedures are necessary and should be covered. Decisions about what care can be covered under what circumstances would only be made by one entity. There would be few outlets if the care an individual needs is denied. 

Rich people would be harmed as well. Currently they can pay for superior care. If all healthcare is free they wouldn’t have that advantage.

For everyone claiming that it works in blank country and they only pay for blank amount for medication, that is only made possible by the cost of US medicine. Other countries have price controls on medication. Drug companies can offer other countries lower prices to accommodate their laws by charging the US higher drug prices. Other countries don’t get better drug prices because their system is so much better, they get better drug prices because the US system sucks. Fixing drug prices in the US will increase drug prices everywhere else. Changing the IS healthcare system will have worldwide effects. Not all of them would be ideal for everyone. Someone will end up paying.

The US is the top country for pharmaceutical innovation because we pay an F*** ton. If we stop gouging patients with excessive care and medication there will be less many available for innovation. I will admit there are billions in profits made, but let’s be honest, if we reduce the profit that health care companies are able to make the people at the top won’t be the ones taking the pay cut. 

The US Healthcare system needs to be changed. It is not sustainable. I don’t know the best way to change it. All I know is it is best to move slow and make incremental changes to minimize the negative impact. It will take decades to fix it. No single person can walk into political office, snap their fingers and make everything perfect. I believe Obama care was a step in the right direction, but we need more changes and we need to prioritize those who are most vulnerable. We are already paying for those who can’t afford care because hospitals charge inflated amounts because their costs are unaffordable and they need to make up for lost costs somehow."
raisedbynarcissists,ey7ksgo,t3_cvzp9g,1566887489.0,"For me it was remembering what my nmom said to me after my suicide attempt at 16 and what I overheard her talking to my dad about it. I spent years denying it ever happened, but it always came bubbling to the surface. I tried explaining away everything that happened in my childhood and doubted myself. I thought I was just overreacting. But I could never explain away what was said that day. After 4ish years I came to terms that my mom never cared. Her mind works a different way and it will always be that way. I’ve opened up to a few people I trust and I’ve been able to discuss what has happened. I still doubt myself every once in awhile, but I always have someone I can talk to that can reassure me that what happened wasn’t normal and was not ok. What has helped me with gaslighting is that what matters is how you experienced the event. People can explain away what has happened or deny that it ever occurred, but it doesn’t change how you experienced the event. Your feelings are valid and it is important to learn how to trust them. No amount of mental gymnastics will change how you feel. If you feel like what happened is wrong I’m willing to bet it was wrong."

internetparents,exvnocw,t3_cucw8e,1566603033.0,If you are truly worried about asking about salary you can contact someone who works or has worked at the company in that same position on LinkedIn. You would be more likely to obtain relevant information that you wouldn’t receive in the interview. Just tell them that you are interested in working for the company and you want to know what the culture is like and what day to day work life is like. You can comfortably discuss salary and when it comes time to interview and they offer you a substantially lower amount adjusted for experience then you have better tools to be able to negotiate on the upper end of what they would be likely to accept.
internetparents,exfmuje,t1_exffrau,1566244007.0,"It is stealing. When she paid the tuition money she made a choice to spend that money. She is taking away your money as a control mechanism. If everything was peachy she wouldn’t have taken your money. She is trying to cause harm to control you. You know this is wrong. You wouldn’t be posting here if you knew she was fully in the right. Don’t doubt yourself. This is abuse full stop.

Don’t give up. If you need a day to take a break and get your mind into a better state, take it but don’t give up. You can do this you are strong. I believe in you. 

Your parents suffering does not negate your own. Your feelings are valid. You are not ruining the relationship. You are trying to enforce reasonable boundaries. You deserve respect. They cannot control everything you do. You are not asking for something unreasonable. They are going out of bounds and if they are truly concerned about upholding the relationship they need to respect your boundaries. Relationships are not one sided. Part of being human is taking responsibility for mistakes and respecting one another.

Again, their suffering or whatever they have done in the past does not negate the harm they are causing now. 

I think you need to ask your sister to be more empathetic to you. Yes your parents may have suffered and you can look at things from their point of view. In a way they are concerned about your wellbeing. But again, you are trying to uphold a very reasonable boundary. They can respect that boundary and be healthily concerned about your well being. You are not in the wrong. Again their actions are abusive. If they are not trying to do you harm or destroy your life they are going about it the wrong way. What they did is abuse full stop.

Don’t let anyone silence what you feel. Your feelings are legitimate.

You are not complaining. You are protecting a reasonable boundary.
