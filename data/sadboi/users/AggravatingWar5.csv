Anxiety,flxn7n6,t3_fo6h6w,1585586143.0,"I'm so glad you posted this Big-Setting!  I've been feeling exactly like you.  The last two days I've been feeling tightness in my chest, constantly paranoid that I may have Covid-19.  It also doesn't help that I have mild asthma.  I did have an anxiety attack yesterday and couldn't breathe.  Once I came to the realization, it was an anxiety attack, I did some breathing exercises and felt a bit better.  I'm still have a bit of chest tightness so my doctor gave me anxiety meds.  I definitely self check my husband and I every day.  Just going to focus on staying home!  Good luck with your anxiety."
