AskReddit,evonde2,t3_ckcnsa,1564651460.0,"Im not married, nor older but for the lat couple years of my life I have had the notion of not wanting kids. I grew up in  a family with 5 kids, and as the oldest by 8 years I pretty much saw almost everything. I saw the good parts of having children but I also have seen the bad. Both my mother and my step father are busy all the time. They have absolutely no time to their selves and their marriage has had some strife because of this. Every time I go over there, my Mom is constantly running around the house, cleaning, cooking, spending her time with the kids or at work. It scared me to imagine myself doing that one day. As someone with a number of Mental Health issues, I can barely manage to get my own shit in order, I couldn't handle someone else's. I also look at it like kids are an anchor in life. I want to travel, try new exciting things constantly. With kids you just don't have that freedom anymore until you are retired and at that point you are older and may not have the energy to do all the things you wanted to do when you were younger.

I commend anyone who has kids and is a good parent to them. Im not trying to shit on your lifestyle, is just isn't for me."

mentalhealth,evcpiua,t1_evcow88,1564420387.0,"My previous therapists were very passive like you described. My new therapist makes therapy feel more like a conversation. For example a couple weeks ago there wasn't any big bad troubling mental health issue that I was struggling with, so we spent the whole hour having a conversation on video games and movies. It was pretty awesome! another thing I like is that in a good way my new therapist is harsher on me than most. When I have an issue I tell him about and there is a answer that would help fix my issue, he makes sure to tell me what I can be doing. And say the following week If I come back in and haven't tried the things he shows his disappointment and really makes sure I know there are things that I can be doing for myself. Find a therapist who fits you and find one who cares their patients and not just the job."
mentalhealth,evcoqzr,t1_evcj36m,1564419887.0,"Find a therapist that suits your personality. It sounds like you haven't found the right therapist for you yet. Be upfront with what you want out of therapy from the beginning. Maybe tell them you want specific answers of what you can be doing to help yourself. I went through years of therapy and quit because of the same frustrations you are having. I only recently tried it again and found a therapist who suits my personality, and tell me exactly what I need to hear."
mentalhealth,evcne95,t3_cjcqnv,1564419052.0,"Therapy works differently for everyone, you need to find a therapist that works for you. There's nothing wrong with finding a new one. Ive been through a couple now and finally found one that works with my personality pretty well. I've always viewed therapy as a conversation, rather than counseling. Sometimes I go to therapy and we end up talking about video games or movies or whatever for the entire hour. I don't always go to my therapist for a big bad life issue. I just go to talk. Another reason why my therapist works so well for me is that he's not afraid to be harsh. When I come to him with a problem that can be fixed, he makes sure to let me know. I often feel like if therapists try to soften your problems and make you feel better with words alone, it just doesn't resonate. Think about criticism and what forms of it you respond to the best, think about what your perfect therapy session would be like and find a therapist who feels the same way. Therapists are like doctors, every single doctor has different kinds of medicine they think is the best for a problem. Some of the medication might not work for you. Its all trial and error."
