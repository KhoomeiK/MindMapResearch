relationship_advice,fcqzygg,t3_eigdw1,1577894739.0,"I used to act like this when I was slightly younger (19ish) where I would still initiate physical contact with guys at parties even though I was in a relationship. In retrospect, my actions were thoughtless and immature because I just wasn’t emotionally ready for a relationship.
Im in a relationship with a guy now who I would never do dirty like that. I’m so cautious to the point where I tell him about any advances that other guys make towards me. I know I am still capable of “cheating” bc of my personality but I know that would not be okay with my boyfriend at all. So I actively make sure I don’t do shit like that anymore
Basically, she needs to grow up and realize her actions are not okay. She won’t learn unless you set those firm boundaries with her.

Being upfront about it is the best way to go. We still struggle when I’m going through my episodes but he has a much deeper understanding of the illness and refers back to the book often.

korea,es7wdsq,t3_c69fin,1561681703.0,I’m not saying people shouldn’t have children. It’s everyone’s own personal decision. It’s just that we are more aware and informed about the consequences that come with having children which is probably why birth rates are going down in Korea (a developed nation) compared to countries that are less developed. I was just pointing out that this trend might eventually make it so that there are few ethnic Koreans left in the future.
korea,es7t7gz,t3_c69fin,1561679170.0,"I don’t know, it was a rhetorical question. There are obviously good reasons as to why Korean people are choosing not to have children. They are realizing that trying to provide a better quality of life can’t be guaranteed especially in the face of climate change. The air pollution/smog in Korea is a huge problem that isn’t going to be solved any time soon. Why would you want your children breathing terrible air? You can’t escape that shit.
Look at China and India with their exploding populations. Their quality of life, for the majority of people, is not good. India has no more water in their reservoirs. I honesty don’t know why people would continue to have children when they don’t have the means and resources to provide for them. A lot of it is because people aren’t educated enough to think about the consequences of giving birth to more human beings. 
There are so many reasons as to not continue to have more children. 
I think the fact that Koreans are being more conscious of these changing circumstances isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The consequence of low birth rates, of course, is that there will be a dwindling number of ethnic Koreans left unless a drastic change takes place."

I was a devout Catholic until I was 12.
I’m very open-minded about my spiritual orientation. It is one that is ever-changing too. It’s a nice fusion of western and Eastern philosophical thought and gives agency to both the individual and universal powers. 
I describe myself as very faithful and my spirituality helps me gain more compassion and wisdom as a person. 
I attend a spiritualist church and becoming increasingly involved. I enjoy being part of a spiritual community.
My spiritual beliefs extend the “rational”. All I know is that I don’t know and there’s not much more to life than just hanging around having a good time"
intj,eri6wzg,t3_c25l4x,1560890786.0,"23F and resolutely childfree. I’m actually a special ed instructor and have been working with kids for over a decade. I like kids and teenagers and they like me too. 

However, I can never imagine giving birth to start a family and that whole shenanigan of being a “mommy”. Not only will birthing a child affect my professional path but also I know that there are profound environmental impacts to having even just one child at this point in time. As an intj, I am probably more aware of the long term effects of having a child that goes beyond the individual.

If I am ever at a place where I can financially support children when I am much older (late 40s or 50s), I would for sure look into being a foster parent or even adopting children who may have autism or other developmental disabilities."
intj,erfes57,t3_c1opi9,1560806646.0,"I am pretty sure I am an intj but then again, I have bipolar disorder so I have an unstable sense of identity sometimes. I think that my moods make come off a lot more ""emotional"" than I really am. There have been many moments in my past where I have given into my emotional impulses but then deeply regretted my decisions afterwards. 

Learning more about the intj type has been overall empowering though. I can learn to separate my personality from my disorder. I also like to think that my mental illness humbled me in many ways because I have more empathy for people who make stupid life decisions since I have also done that. 

As an intj with bipolar, I am a model patient. I take my prescribed medication daily, meditate, and do yoga. I eat avocados, abstain from drinking much, and ground myself through spirituality. I have a deep knowledge of my condition and am very honest with myself and others about the struggles I have. I let my family, friends, and co-workers know exactly how bipolar will manifest itself in each context and assure them that my shift in moods is not to be taken personally. I will often ask my boyfriend for space when I am feeling particularly ill because I prefer being sick on my own. My psychiatrist and therapist are usually impressed with my ability to overcome the challenges. I forget to give myself credit but I do try hard not to let my illness get the best of me. Anyways, now that I typed all this out, I am pretty sure I am an intj. I had a fascination with mbti since I was 16 (I'm 24 now) and I sometimes molded my personality into more likable ones (like enfps). lol"

It's just one small thought that can make me lose all affection for them and my brain begins to scheme about how I can escape yet another relationship. Then I really hate myself a little bit because I don't like the idea of hurting other people's feelings. 

I try and remind myself that love is an action and not a feeling. But what if you no longer want to put in the effort for someone who you have become indifferent towards? I'm 24 now and only recently becoming more comfortable with myself and in the past, I got into relationships because I wanted to fit in with my peers. I just started becoming serious about going to law school which brings a lot of doubt into whether maintain my relationship with my bf is worth my time and effort (as cold as it sounds).

Another issue is my unreasonably high expectations too. My preference for alone time over cuddling. My preference for my hobbies over doing stuff together.

Afterwards, I went over to by bf's house where we just talked about our day (he went to the driving range with his brothers and nephews). We smoked a bowl together and went to sleep.

Today, we woke up early so that he could go golfing and I went to a different coffee shop near the church I attend. I got my coffee fix then went to service by myself (bf and I don't necessarily share the same beliefs but that's no problem!). The service today was about climate change and overpopulation (I go to a spiritualist church so the topics they discuss are different from Christian teachings). The reverend discussed how food and water will become drastically limited due to overpopulation and decreasing farmland. It made me feel very grateful that I decided to be childfree at an early age (23) so that I can start preparing for a more sustainable lifestyle in the future. I love thinking about how much money I will save simply by not having children. I tend to be fairly environmentally conscious too and would love to own a tiny home one day that uses renewable energy sources :)
