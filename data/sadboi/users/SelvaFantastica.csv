So, start from realizing this and knowing your anxiety is totally normal.  That said, I've sat in a ton of employee interviews and have a few ideas of what could help.  First, about the weight (I'm an obese woman myself,) wear well fitting clothes, not too loose, not too fitted, freshly laundered and pressed if necessary.  Decent clothing and grooming builds confidence. Greet people respectfully but a small smile and and easy going attitude is always a good step to put people at ease.  Finally, try to help around when you can.  Don't ever use the ""that's not my job"" excuse but of course, don't let anybody abuse your good will.  Remember that most people are decent in general and everybody has problems as well.  Finally, you are 28, you have time to learn, make mistakes, grow.  Do that.  I'll be praying for you."
lexapro,ffx470e,t3_evmxqy,1580317383.0,"It's tough!  Once you are on meds, it is very hard to stop them.  So, take a good look at your symptoms and recognize that if you need a med, you need a med.  I never understand why it is ok to take meds for high blood pressure for life without even thinking about it and without people looking down at you.  But tell them you are on antidepressants and people will always tell you that you can ""do it"" without meds etc.  I've on meds for over 14 years and know i need them.  So I take them and have a decent life rather than being on disability.

As for the side effects, they might be worth the benefits.  There are many meds and if one doesn't work, another can be tried.  It's your health, you decide."

I don't see that you ever visited a therapist?  The trouble is finding the right one who will actually talk and not just give you a bunch of exercises to change the way you think (doesn't work for me at all.)  But you obviously need to work out your feelings towards you mother, father?, being pretty much abandoned and surviving on your own while suffering from a mental disorder.

So, if you are able, I would suggest you visit a therapist for some time.  My therapist changed my life.  I saw her for 8 months and i learned so much about myself!

A small bunch of spinach  
1/2 raw beet  
Few pcs of fruit that you like, i personally like pineapple, strawberries and apple.  But i add any fruit that i like and it's in season at a good price.  Just enough to flavor a bit.  
1 cup orange juice  
1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt (activia for the live cultures is best)  
1 teaspoon of  ground flax seed.

Blend everything and drink it.  You can play with it for flavor: change the yogurt flavor, add lime/lemon juice, cucumber, etc.  but always use the same ingredients.  The only thing you can change is the fruit for taste mostly.

Anxietyhelp,f44efrb,t3_davqa0,1571351097.0,"Hi!

I am a  14 year anxiety veteran.  I have tried everything to find a way to deal with this monster with ups and downs along the way.  At start, i went for ssris, paxil, which made me gain 40lbs i am still carrying.  I weaned myself off and started a regime of natural supplements with the help of a holistic psychiatrist.  Worked for a year until i started wanting to jump off a bridge.  I was put on zoloft after that and stay well for about 7 great years.  I was able to get pregnant and now have a lovely 3 year old.  Zoloft quit working a month ago and I was added buspar to the mix and I am still waiting to see if this is going to work or not.

That's the background.  But I am with you in that more needs to be done to feel better.  I've never good at exercising for example, maybe i should give it a try.  I've been researching Niacin as well, which might work too.  Maybe a combination of meds, supplements, exercise and meditation... I don't know.  But i know the suffering and dread.  

I just want to tell you, keep trying!  Do not give up!  Half of my mother's family have the condition and we have seen everything.  Two suicide attempts (one on a 12 yr old med resistant), people high on meds, alcohol... but we are all alive!  The final answer will be unique to you for sure.  Just don't give up.

I feel i will be medicated the rest of my days no matter what.  I don't mind.  As long as I feel better.  Choose wisely, know the risks of meds, get well.

My very best wishes!

In my experience, zoloft gave me heightened anxiety for the first 3-4 weeks.  The first week i was trembling, i could not swallow anything and i was at a point of crying all day long.  I managed with Ativan and little by little zoloft did its job.  I've been on it for about 8 years and it was perfectly ok.  It's effect is now winding down so doc added buspar to my combo and I am waiting for it to kick in.  Buspar did not give me any side effects yet but i've been on it a few days only.

Best of luck."
