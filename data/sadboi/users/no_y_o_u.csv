If this is true, even if he was being sarcastic and joking, he needs to at least own up to the fact that people are listening to him, taking it the wrong way, and doing dangerous things as a result.

TrueOffMyChest,fn6zy6h,t1_fn5pdac,1586710617.0,"Using the term braids generally is disingenuous. Senegalese twists aren’t the same as a fishtail. What white person uses crochet for the intended purpose (besides fashion of course)?

Never did I mention a pure race argument. Culture is shared indeed. But I’m talking about hair, which is in a category by itself because some black people have hair that’s only shared by other minorities. Not anything else to be used as a metaphor. Straight hair isn’t cultural, because most every race has straight hair. Afro-textured hair is part of a culture because people share experiences based on it that most other cultures don’t (then protective styles stemmed from there.) I’m not saying white people can’t put in a crochet, you’re free to do whatever as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone else. I’m saying if a white person puts in a crochet, just to be “cool,” and gets praised while a black woman gets discriminated against it for the same thing, that’s the issue. That’s the heart of cultural appropriation— one culture that had nothing to do with another borrowing from the first (which is fine, that’s what humans have been doing for centuries), pretending as if it’s new or stylish or whatever and getting praised for it while those from the original culture get labeled as weird or “others.” That is the issue. Once people stop treating black women’s typical hair as ghetto only when it’s on a black woman, then the issue is tabled. 

Until then, The concept has meaning. Now I’m not usually this intense about hair. If someone wants their hair to fall out because they used braids that don’t go with their hair texture, do what you want. I used to think cultural appropriation was dumb when I was first introduced to it as well (especially the hair issue, probably because I wasn’t into my hair upkeep as much as I am now.) But now I get it. I’m not as intense about it as some, but I get it and now I’m trying to explain to others who never have and never will run into the problem why it’s an issue in today’s age."

No there are people alive now who were or are discriminated against for their natural textured hair. Can only hope the thread helps him see why some people are pissed about this topic.

I kinda see it. Hair is hair, and in a perfect world where regardless of hair everyone was treated the same I wouldn’t care. To me at least, this isn’t about “this is our thing you can’t have it!!!” (Ignoring that braids in non-textured hair will mess the hair up/cause it to fall out, but do what you want!) But as long as black people are still getting discriminated against for hair styles white people wear as a fashion statement, there’s grounds for an issue and for people to be passionate about it."

Protective braids are however. 4c /extremely kinky hair is almost unheard of for white people, so it doesn’t even go both ways (which is why some people’s hair falls out/breaks if they put heavy braids in them)

Yes white people have naturally poofy hair, but it’s not the same as some black natural poofy hair of certain types and textures. For instance, caucasian hair doesn’t really experience shrinkage. This is where the cultural aspect starts to come into play"

TigerKing,fn2ge2z,t1_fmiynvu,1586588063.0,"So your argument is that since he was 19 it’s fine? 19 is barely a legal adult, definitely not fully formed yet (I feel like people forget, your prefrontal cortex that’s main function is for *judgement* and *decision making* isn’t done growing until around age 26 at best.) Few 19 year olds have their shit together, and if you throw a very real addiction into it of course he would stay. I’m fairly sure most every drug addict would stay if they got supplied free drugs, it’s not like they’re in their right mind. The arbitrary event of turning 18 doesn’t automatically make you a person capable of knowing all that could happen based on your decisions, especially if your still developing brain is getting bombarded by drugs. Joe exhibited predatory behavior and just because it was legal (again, turning 18 is hella arbitrary, you don’t flip a switch on your 18th birthday to suddenly be mature) doesn’t make it better because John “was an adult.”

I get that treating everyone under 30 as kids is toxic, but contextual information is important. Some people treat early 20 something’s like kids for a reason after all (again not saying it’s right.)"
