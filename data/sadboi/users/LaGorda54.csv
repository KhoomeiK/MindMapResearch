AskReddit,fqpa1ar,t3_gk2gc0,1589540292.0,"I’m not an anti-Vaxxer but my parents were. They were new age types in the 70s-80s and I was never vaccinated. I was also denied medical treatment as a child to the point of it perhaps crossing in to child endangerment, because they “didn’t believe in western medicine”. At least not when anything was wrong with me, which was often since I was very asthmatic and suffered from frequent bronchitis. I’m almost 40 now, and my kid is absolutely vaccinated and so am I. 
As a side note, neither of my parents lived  a very long life and I was an orphan before 20.  When I was living on  my own in my teens, I made the vital discovery that doctors aren’t the devil and when you get sick you don’t have to suffer for months... you can just go to a doctor and get real medicine and stop suffering pretty immediately."
Scams,fqncxy1,t1_fqnbn16,1589492641.0,"The mailing address matches the street address of the IRS office in the capital of my state. So did the address on the return envelope they included in the letter. Which also strikes me as unusual since everything I’ve ever mailed to the IRS goes to a PO BOX  number or is addressed like:
IRS OFFICE OF STATE
CITY, STATE, ZIP 
And doesn’t contain any street address at all. It’s one of the many small things that seem like red flags. 

I also found it very strange that when I told her a fax wasn’t possible for me (since it seemed less than legit) and asked for her email to send it as a pdf she told me that wasn’t possible, that she wasn’t allowed to give it out. When I then suggested I’d just hold the documents until the offices were open to receive mail, she told me she didn’t want that either and suggest I find access to a fax. (With my time machine)

I had a hard time thinking of keto friendly stock-able items, so I actually checked out some related posts for inspiration. So, after some research... for the freezer; some big bags of frozen broccoli, cauliflower, spinach,  frozen salmon and shrimp.  Canned goods consisted of cabbage, turnip greens,  mixed greens, and green beans. I bought a few cans of spam, some salt cured country ham, and a variety of flavored tuna packs since those are a lunch favorite of mine. For the occasional sweet tooth, got a stash of sugar free gelatin mixes. I also got some jerky, coffee, nuts and extra salt and cooking oils.

PCOS,fkdm1bs,t3_fhplkz,1584084298.0,"Actually, the exact same thing happened to me. After some extensive weight loss I got pregnant, something I hadn’t believed to be possible. During my pregnancy a grapefruit sized cyst was discovered on my right ovary. They took a “wait and see” approach during my pregnancy and it was closely monitored. I wanted a natural birth but it turned out to be hindered by said giant cyst, so a few days into laboring I ended up delivering via c section and my doctor addressed the cyst then. It turned out to be so damaged the whole ovary had to be removed.  That was 9 years ago. Since then my periods have never been more regular, but I have developed what sometimes feels like crippling pmdd. Not sure if that’s related at all, or just coincidence."

I have never intricately planned and tracked them as part of my overall week of eating though, and I think that might be helpful to me since allowing myself to have access to food in a compulsive, non planned or thought out way is just not successful for me.

Also recently I found a pile of undelivered fedex boxes that had just... “fallen off a truck” on our rural road. One of those boxes was 3 feet tall and 75 lbs. I called fedex to tell them... hey your packages are laying by the road. The amount of time and phone calls it took to speak to a person who could grasp what I was telling them was, frankly quite alarming. 

I hate shipping with them and will only do it by customer request. But in conclusion, fuck FedEx."
