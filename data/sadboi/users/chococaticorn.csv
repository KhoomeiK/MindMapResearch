Be aware of your stress level. Stress *will* mess with your period.

Be aware of dietary changes. Anemia (vitamin deficiency but especially iron deficiency) causes missed periods.

Investigate the side effects of coming off your particular pill. Depending on the type (esp those 3-month ones), they will also cause your period to act up while your hormones are regulating themselves again.
