FIFA,f57knvr,t3_dn3v2s,1572038046.0,I ended up with guardiola bc I cba to grind for more tokens. Plus he fits in the team and gives chem so not bad
FIFA,f50cq3r,t1_f50bzm3,1571925395.0,Would you recommend guerreiro as a LAM maybe?

FIFA,f40h2pp,t1_f40gsn1,1571298135.0,I also got cheillini untradeable ! Rest weren‚Äôt so good tho haha
FIFA,f40cs3w,t3_dj28sy,1571293989.0,Lmao. I once had a dream that I was on the pitch in fifa and the rest of the players were super tiny and I was stepping over them and scoring. Had to stop playing for 6 months after that üòÇ
FIFA,f2zqxyj,t1_f2zqw8y,1570535537.0,Thanks for the advice man

FIFA,f2qzsq6,t1_f2qan6g,1570368383.0,I like this. I used to play on balanced everything but it felt like there wasn‚Äôt enough involvement from the CAMs
FIFA,f2q7yvv,t1_f2q5s3c,1570357299.0,I do the same also. I‚Äôve been struggling to score however even though I create a lot of chances smh
FIFA,f2q4cn2,t1_f2q2mdh,1570355485.0,I might be using pukki
FIFA,f2pzjuc,t3_de0k3h,1570353153.0,"GG well played homie! Also, would you recommend Werner. I‚Äôm looking to pick him up and put him in my 4222 so I was wondering if he was a key player"
FIFA,f2e3g3j,t3_dd34de,1570178403.0,Lol  trying to complete ndombele sbc and need to score two goals with my ligue 1 striker and it‚Äôs so annoying and frustrating
FIFA,f2bsvr7,t1_f2b7ouy,1570130617.0,Hmm I would suggest maybe trying out different formations depending on your play style. If you don‚Äôt really utilise wingers that much maybe switch to 41212(2)
FIFA,f2b7jhm,t3_dctw02,1570122814.0,Happy Cake day! What formation do u use
FIFA,f203ove,t1_f203c8o,1569854873.0,What chem style did you use
FIFA,f203nn8,t1_f203f3h,1569854858.0,Yh I agree. And his dribbling is great but with a chem style can be improved further
FIFA,f203jyb,t1_f203fmg,1569854816.0,Awesome now I can‚Äôt wait to try him
FIFA,f202n7c,t1_f200p31,1569854361.0,Me three. Apart from slight input delay im really enjoying this gameplay
FIFA,f201xom,t3_dbcd5i,1569854013.0,I agree but shielding is actually near enough non existent from my experience so far.
FIFA,f201q5o,t3_dbcdl0,1569853904.0,Keep playing games. This is one of the things I‚Äôve been enjoying this fifa that you actually have to learn defence and offence etc. I would also suggest playing different formations and tactics to see which you suit you the best
FIFA,f1yvn1q,t3_db61gr,1569825835.0,I actually really love this game atm. Games where I play well and finish my chances I get the W and when I don‚Äôt create proper chances I don‚Äôt win. Defending being more manual is quite beneficial although I‚Äôve noticed some players still use one player and run around the whole time waiting for ai interception

FIFA,f1dvp0c,t3_d90gmk,1569401878.0,I think ea should increase the amount of xp.
FIFA,f172m3w,t1_f172bhq,1569233530.0,Might have to wait for the full game
FIFA,f170jg2,t1_f16y8k4,1569231361.0,I think you are right as I‚Äôve also switched to PS4. But on console I got the message saying you can now use the web app so might have to wait for full game.
FIFA,f16v3we,t1_f16v03o,1569225177.0,Are you on the companion app
FIFA,f12tcug,t1_f12t9g6,1569146324.0,Ok thanks. What time was that around
FIFA,f12t71g,t3_d7oej3,1569146240.0,"Irrelevant to your question but I was wondering what the market is like on Xbox. PS4 has around 3 mill active transfers, could you possibly tell me on average on Xbox if u don‚Äôt mind?"
