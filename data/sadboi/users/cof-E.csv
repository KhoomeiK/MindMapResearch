Stop trying to act like it’s not a big deal, you’re obviously someone who is comfortable with their body, maybe you don’t have the severe anxiety I do, but my views on nudity (for me) is that I want to be able to share my body to others when I’m in the right mindset and when I feel I can make that decision the next day or the next week. I don’t feel like it was my choice and it feels disgusting.

I mean, look at Kim Jong Un, dude may use other things to “coerce” people to do things, but at the end of the day it’s the heart of the message which the regime slams upon its people. It’s the prophetic symbol which his reign holds over the people that allows him to have so much of it.

I don’t care about prostitution or drug dealers but slavery seems to be more of a ‘pro-society’ practice.

Slavery was created in-part as a way to maintain society in every aspect, hell if you wanna be one of these anarcho-communist blah blah blah people you could argue about philosophical enslavement of wage-workers or anyone who lives in society. 

In the end, we all answer to one person or one group of people. Being for slavery, in my opinion, is pro-society.

Now if you want to argue that slavery, if benefitting only you, would be something I would accept, still it’s a hard no. 

Why would I need to enslave someone to have power over them, I can do that myself through emotional manipulation if I please. Also, fuck, the amount of effort you would have to put in to enslave people just for power SCREAMS superiority complex.

I sort of just tell him all the shit that happens to me (abuse, sexual assault, prejudice, drug abuse, etc. etc.) but I think he thinks I’m saying it because I need someone to tell me I’m okay or to not feel alone.

I just don’t have anything else to bring up, nothing exactly effects me except my bipolar disorder and even that isn’t something which I specifically feel burdened with.

Maybe you’re not supposed to but I guess, take for example, growing a garden or painting, they  require some sort of passion or a interest or something which drives you to keep doing it. You usually cash out with some sort of self-emotional gratuity but I don’t get the drive or “gift” per-say of looking at what I’ve accomplished and feeling proud or happy about it.

When I say “not knowing who I am” I mean that I genuinely don’t know who the person is that was bearer of my name. I’m not saying this to be all philosophical and edge lord I mean that my past and my memories have equated to nothing regarding an emotional maturity. 

Sure, I have become more intelligent and I’ve grown to understand things more clearly, but when you were born into a low income single-family home you take what you are given and you run with it.

I’ve run with everything I have been given and that’s all I have, I don’t feel as if I can comprehend a solid person in the back of my head that I can resonate with.

Schizoid,fcrh63k,t1_fcrfz25,1577901770.0,"I appreciate your kindness, I live in south Florida but, it’s best if I just finish my schooling and save my money for when I leave.

I’m trying to get a job so I can have time away from her, and so I can afford car inscurance.

It’s also not simple, I need my mom, she has everything, she has all of the info for my school, my insurance, everything I need for college. I know it sounds terrible to say that it’s only 1 more year but I’ve done this for years, and I’m seeing a psychologist, obviously I can’t say everything but I’m trying to work through the stuff I can say.

I’m trying to leave my parents without suspicion and I can’t go through another big event like this, I have to power through. 

Thank you for your kindness, I will update you and anyone who asks if anything happens."
Schizoid,fcl7m31,t1_fcl6jrb,1577741549.0,"It’s a delusion, well to others it is. To me for years and years of my life I thought my parents were paid actors, I thought that they had somehow kidnapped me or something and everyone was putting up this façade to keep the show going.

It’s not that I think my life is being broadcast to the world but it’s like everything isn’t real, like in derealization, when you feel as if nothing is real but you understand that it’s a feeling that eventually will subside, or others may have their symptoms of derealization become less severe when others touch them etc. 

For me Truman syndrome was my childhood, always smiling for everyone because I felt if I didn’t something and would happen, like possibly everything would stop and everyone would drop the act. It forced me to adapt into someone I knew I wasn’t.

It’s like you’re willing to go to lengths such as crossing the street without looking, wondering if the car is going to have to stop or else the show will stop. Or thinking that when you go to bed that the commercials are on and you’re constantly hypersensitive to everything. Maybe someone isn’t at school for a certain amount of time and you start to wonder if they’re getting another double. Maybe someone said something and it sounded oddly like something someone else said to me years ago and I start to think that possibly they’re reusing the same scripts.

Sometimes, because my life is so repetitive I realize that something I did today was identical to something I did years ago, and because I always feel the same it’s as if someone hit the rewind button, like you’re replaying the same episodes again and again and again and you feel as if the second that you show your suicidality to the world or to others they’ll cut the cameras, it will all be over, and maybe you won’t feel so crazy."
Boomerhumour,f8bsitx,t3_dzv3yf,1574444320.0,Isn't overfishing a massive problem and has led dangerous practices which kill off huge amounts of fish populations ultimately resulting in less fish being able to repopulate causing the rise of prices for fish and the mistreatment of the environment resulting in a decrease in jobs and resources available for undeveloped countries.  Or is that just fake news.

sociopath,f4nbe67,t1_f4kqtkf,1571687706.0,"It’s not safe do that because they’ll tell my mom and I don’t need her any more up my ass then she already is. I have a psychologist and I’m seeing him today. I’ve always had problem with authority but I’m able to keep the whole ‘young and harmless’ image but I’m trying.

It’s just hard to find the energy I had to try to keep fitting in ( I like having people to go to for any homework help or maybe parties.) I honestly don’t care much but I just don’t want to live with the consequences. I’m smart and apply myself but it’s my helicopter mom and the kids at my school who I’m trying not to fucking pop in the face that are making it not as easy as I would like it.

I do have some teachers, but I go to a private school (I’m on financial aid.) The problem is that these people have had opportunities to have therapy and resources their whole life and don’t fully understand that if DCF gets involved I won’t have any family to go to except my dad and his wife and child. I can’t do that or else I’ll lose my shit.

 I can’t share a lot the things I do as I might be taken out of school or put into mandatory counseling, which I don’t need right now especially since I’m still a minor.

I don’t know I’m just trying to control my impulses is all."
sociopath,f4jtr6f,t1_f4jq5tl,1571626144.0,"First of all, this a is a discussion you brainless cuck. 

Second of all I’m not looking for anything; not for validation or pity or any of that shit. I’m trying to have a reasonable conversation with like-minded people and ask if they have similar experiences or thoughts as I do, but it seems your self-entitled douchebagery is something you want to show off on your high horse. 

I’m not pissed off by your senseless “insults” because you obviously can’t read with such a ‘by the book’ ASPD attitude of not giving a shit and being angsty or whatever people who try to mimic every sociopath they’ve ever seen on media type of bullshit. 

This post was simply to inform others about things that I do and to ask any other ‘ASPD or neurotypicals’ if this would be something appropriate to talk about, this is so when I am ever in a position of small talk that I don’t over step a boundary... because I’m actually trying to get further in my life and I’m trying to develop at least a believable personality.

I just want to be able to get through a day without being asked if I’m fucking mental because I brought up something I did that might come off as psychotic to someone else. 

I’m trying to learn. 

Also yeah I agree that animals die everyday and it doesn’t really matter but that’s my own personal belief, others could take what I said out of context and use it for future cases (if they ever were to occur) against me and I’d be shit out of luck because I couldn’t catch on to *obvious social queues that only neuros would perceive as being sadistic or psychopathic

So thanks for commenting and lighten up ;)"
