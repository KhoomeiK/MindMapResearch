I majored in clinical psychology with a minor in English and research methods. I‚Äôm hoping to specialize in personality disorders, with an emphasis on Cluster B (Anti-social, Histrionic, Borderline, and Narcissistic Personality Disorder) Cluster B disorders fascinate me because they are theorized to be the ‚Äúnurture‚Äù part of the whole nature vs. nurture debate. Despite this, these disorders transcend time, culture, and circumstance. How could these disorders be so prevalent despite having such rigid diagnostic requirements? Hopefully, I can inch a little closer to the truth.

Honestly I‚Äôm having an entire epiphany as I write this because I don‚Äôt know why Ive never thought about how my fascination with pathologies of the human mind and the way people treat me could be related. Thank you so much for all of your advice and comments I appreciate it more than you know."

Every time emotions come up on this sub, theres such a wide spectrum of experiences and opinions that are presented. It made me think about why men have disproportionate rates of depression and suicidality, and how its not just the stigma of men having to be strong that is alone causing this, and there are actually a lot of factors that contribute to this struggle for men. It seems like the mental health system fails men all the time, and we don‚Äôt look at it. But not on my soon to be psychiatric watch!

I‚Äôm going to grad school now and keep a bullet journal and y‚Äôall better BELIEVE that I still be on that bullshit"
confessions,ffibqv7,t3_etnoks,1579970088.0,"The last thing you should feel is shame. YOU didn‚Äôt victimize anyone, YOU didn‚Äôt look at your own family and think about how to use them, YOU didn‚Äôt create this situation. So, it‚Äôs not up to you to carry the shame, because, like you said OP, you were literally five years old. Try looking at a five year old now as an adult and ask yourself if that child could be capable of concocting victimization. 

I hope it gets better OP, your cousin is a disgusting person, but there is absolutely nothing impure about you. Sending love"

It always helps to have someone of your own demographic as a counselor and because of all the stigma about men going to therapy, more men would perhaps feel comfortable"

Good for you. Don‚Äôt let people step on you OP"
AskDocs,fehn7hf,t3_ep0jgm,1579119956.0,"It‚Äôs okay to be embarrassed but I agree with everyone else. You will definitely be the only one in this situation that finds this awkward. Your parents won‚Äôt bat an eyelash, in their lives they‚Äôve more than likely had medical problems with their genitals too. And you‚Äôre their kid. You can do this!"

AskReddit,fckbrh4,t3_ehg5ac,1577721750.0,"I was walking to my friends apartment a few blocks away from mine one night. On the way there my roommates boyfriend saw me in the parking lot and we started talking. I had a joint on me and he offered to walk me there and share it with me. Keep in mind I knew this guy personally for over a year. I would have even considered us friends. 

Anyway we stop at a bench that‚Äôs surrounded by darkness to finish the joint when he tried to kiss me. I was so caught off guard and kind of awkwardly chuckled and told him that if we could just sit and talk that‚Äôd be great. Suddenly he got this look in his eye as he stared at me and I can‚Äôt explain it because his expression was somewhat neutral, but my stomach dropped and I felt like I should run. In a split second he lunged at me and grabbed me by the shoulders and then attempted to wrap a hand around my throat. But because I saw that look in his eye and realized what he was going to do, I was already tense and ready to run before he even lunged, I screamed before he even touched me, and had braced myself enough that I was able to yank myself away from him before he got me on the ground. I was screaming so loud that he started walking away after calling me a bitch. 

I truly think that if I hadn‚Äôt caught on to that one small look, I would have been assaulted. Even a second of bracing yourself can save you."
CasualConversation,fbuj8pa,t3_eejv7d,1577115337.0,"Thanks for being so kind. I‚Äôm currently struggling with setting healthy boundaries with my family, as they are very heavy drinkers and very controlling and cruel to me. I am 24 and completely independent so it‚Äôs just a matter of getting them to understand. Slow progress is still progress but by god if it isn‚Äôt unbearable to continue to deal with them. They just lose their mind when I don‚Äôt do what they say so everything has to be meticulous. Not really sure why I chose to vent here but yeah. Thanks so so much for listening and please share with us too so we can return the favor! Much love"
