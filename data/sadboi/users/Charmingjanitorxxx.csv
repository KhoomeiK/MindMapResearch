HaircareScience,fopij09,t3_fpn3vc,1587962395.0,"I've had an irestore for three years now. I've also been on Finasteride 1 mg for 13 years. Before the Finasteride my hair was thinning terribly at the age of 23. I responded wonderfully to the Finasteride and felt good for many years. But I don't want a transplant. And while no one can tell my hair is diffused thinning, because of the way I style it, I know my thin areas. 

I tried Rogaine and my hair grew back immensely. Unfortunately, all those stories you read about skin wrinkling are true. My girlfriend even commented on my skin beginning to deepen in its wrinkles. So I quit rogaine and bought an irestore. 

Irestore takes months to work. But it does. It strengthens your hair and makes it thicker and provides some regrowth. With me, it just added vellus hairs to my top. But the sides near my temples experienced significant regrowth. 

It definitely works, it just takes time. As with all hair treatments, success is really trial and error."

It's the same anxiety brain that led me to drinking in the first place. People really only focus on themselves and whatever new passing gossip is making the rounds. You're fighting the good fight.

ScareTheater,f9pj22p,t3_e682vx,1575538533.0,It’s shameful. I recently listened to a podcast by Michael Rodenbaum with Corey Feldman saying some of these interactions and behaviors he saw as a child.

news,f6kwmhd,t1_f6j14s7,1572922552.0,"Nah. There’s a lot of bible belt southerns that abhorred racism and actually fought against it. 
You can’t assume every Southern owned slaves. And you especially can’t assume all Southerns were of the same beliefs. There’s a great book called Sundown Towns that documents racism all across the USA and talks about early socio-economic practices like block-busting and other worse atrocities. Unfortunately, those that were against the racism of the time have been painted with a broad brush. There’s just so much complexity and earnestness that gets lost in history. But I’d understand someone thinking that southerns are inherently feeling a right to slavery. But the truth is where it was undocumented, especially during the civil rights movement is especially hideous. Nothing is as simple as just pointing at one region."
