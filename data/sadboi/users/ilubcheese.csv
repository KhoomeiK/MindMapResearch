infj,fq0t1qo,t3_gg4bkz,1589037265.0,When it becomes too overwhelming I have to pause whatever I’m watching to give me a moment to calm down from it. I only do this when I am watching alone and I just bear it when I’m with others. I’m trying to break out of this habit because it completely ruins the pace of a film
Anxiety,fkqi9x4,t3_fjobz7,1584446761.0,Thank you for helping me realise this. I have never posted a comment until today. I’m gonna try to work on that
