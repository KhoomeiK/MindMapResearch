Some therapists handle certain mental difficulties in different ways. Also not every therapist has dealt with every mental illness they treat. It’s not a personal jab to the original therapist.

Mental health is too important to stick with someone if you don’t feel they are able to help you on your journey. You and I don’t know the therapist or the depths of what OP is dealing with or their sessions. Also this has nothing to do with love and hate. It’s literally about what ends up being best for OP based on OPs thoughts of the whether there is still trust and it’s helpful enough to stick through."

Breathe. Deep inhale. Long exhale. Repeat.

I can’t imagine the crushing heartbreaking feeling but I do know that what happened isn’t a reflection on  your worth as a person. It doesn’t mean you aren’t enough, it means that she wanted something different. She did something extremely selfish and that’s on her. 

It’s okay to be upset and it’s okay to not want to see her right away. You will work out the details of every little thing later. For right now, be with a good friend and do something that makes you happy or gives you some peace. See if you can stay somewhere else tonight, get some of your things while she’s out of the house and take the time to gather your thoughts and let yourself have some relief from this situation. 

If you don’t have a therapist or someone you can confide in in addition, it may be worth looking for to help you heal, but for right now, take your time. Nothing needs to happen right this second. Your heart and mental health are the most important things right now so please take care of them.

Anxiety,f78buup,t3_dup9x7,1573490108.0,"It’s totally okay if you need medication type assistance to get you back to where you want to be. It can be for a short time or a long term kind of solution. You can work with a doctor to try a natural supplement or you can try antidepressants. 

If you want to go the non medical route and it’s something you feel you can do, try and get sunlight or exercise. Both will raise your spirits a little at a time and make you feel happier. 

If you need to build confidence to help battle the anxiety of circumstances being out of your control, work on raising your self esteem so that you trust that you can handle any situation that gets thrown at you. I personally have used “10 Days to Self Esteem” and it helps reframe thoughts as well as includes an anxiety checklist quiz so you can track your progress. 

It’s not something that’s going to change overnight, it’s going to be a process but I’m sure you already know that. Don’t beat yourself up either, anxiety happens and it doesn’t make you a broken person to have it. You can manage it and have a more fulfilled life and make sure that it NEVER runs your life again. You got this! You’re the boss of your mind and body!"

booksuggestions,f6xyqdz,t3_dtknyu,1573262468.0,"My favorite books are: 
The Princess Bride by William Goldman - really a must read 
The Picture of Dorian Gray - Oscar Wilde 
The Hitchikers Guide! 
Howls Moving Castle - Diana Wynn Jones - I actually named my dog after the character Howl in the book and I can practically quote it to you 😂

Good Omens - Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman! Super fun read if you enjoyed the banter of Hitchhikers Guide.  

If you’re wanting to start discworld, I personally started with “Mort” because the character of Death was super interesting but my partner has read like every Discworld Novel and loves Terry Pratchett and says, 

“So my favorite ones are already into the series but the start of the Citywatch series is “Guards Guards”, start of the Death series is “Mort”, the very first book is “Color of Magic”. A good stand alone book is “Thief of Time”, it has recurring characters but you don’t need to know who they are to follow along. 

The best ones are the ones with Moist Von Lipwig, his first one is “Going Postal” (also a film) and doesn’t need prior knowledge but helps with Vetinari’s character (deep character who has the most books in the series - basically he’s in most of them)

You could always start with watching Going Postal the film and decide if you like it. Watching the “Hogfather” (the second Death book) can get you into Deaths character. Both films are 2-3 hours long. Shortest book in the series is “Eric” by Terry Pratchett and is a Death Novel.”


Death is my favorite Discworld character but Moist is also great!"

Tbh, no one knows what the hell is going on but it gets easier to not stress out about it. Graduating college was the most free I’ve ever felt so hang in there! 

10 Steps to Self Esteem is a workbook that helps reframe thinking and has a Depression and Anxiety evaluation you can take. 

Get your Shit together by Sarah Knight was enjoyable and made me feel like like a mess. 

You are a badass by Jen Sincero was encouraging. It can be nice having a cheerleader on your side. 

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People May help with time management if you need it. 

The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo helped me let go of things that didn’t serve me - emotionally and literally. 

I hope some of this helps. I have been out of college like 3 years and everything has balanced out for me now but I had a major breakdown before I graduated. You can DM me if you’d like to chat.

AustralianShepherd,esegb7u,t3_c73qi5,1561897716.0,"I’m also a first time Aussie owner and it’s a tough first few weeks. I personally had the puppy blues which had me spiraling and it didn’t help the adjustment for me. If you have this as well, it’s actually fairly common. 

My boy will be 14 weeks tomorrow and it does get easier, I think mainly because it takes time to learn your pup and for them to learn you. 

This is what it’s been like: 
I got him at 10 weeks old. I was lucky because he slept through the night already when I got him. It was really tough because without a full range of shots he couldn’t go anywhere besides our yard. She/He will need to be worn out somehow and it’s tough because they also get bored easy. You’ll start figuring out what works for him/her. 

Socialization is super important at the ages between 10-16 weeks so be sure to take your pup places and carry him or put him in a shopping cart at dog friendly stores Lowe’s and Home Goods are two!) Just avoid dog centric places until he’s had all shots. 

Aussies tend to be shy and one person dogs although they can love whole families. 

Crate Training is super important because I’ve noticed he doesn’t know how to relax unless he’s in his crate. Make it a fun place (personally I got a large one) and have him go in for treats.

I started basic training immediately for mental stimulation, it’s really important to teach them to be calm and teach them when it’s inappropriate for bursts of energy. I had to teach my puppy to sit and wait for his food because when we first got him he would try and jump and snatch it because he got so excited. Through teaching him to wait he’s actually learned that in most situations when I’m going to do something with him or give him something, he knows to sit and contain his excitement. 

Aussies don’t do well with negative reinforcement so most of the time yelling, “No!” Will cause more energy and frustration from your pup. I’ve had to learn ways to give positive reinforcement and teach things out of him (making a command for “hush” part of our training to teach him not to bark, etc. and rewarding him when he stops barking) Treats are a go to. 

I learned a lot from watching Cesar Milan, Zac George, and Life with Aspen (this last one is specifically about a woman who vlogs her experience with her Aussie and information ranging from Do’s and Don’ts to Grooming videos) on YouTube. 

Good luck!"

That’s reassuring to hear. I work with him fairly often and can’t wait for him to start going to puppy classes! Nipping has been a bit if an issue tho 😒 He does get a little rebellious but I’m thinking it could also be less of an issue with an established routine.

My partner is a runner so Ideally they will run together and then I’ll walk with him for 30 mins. One weekends I can give him more.
