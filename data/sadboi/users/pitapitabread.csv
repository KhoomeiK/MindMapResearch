I’ve done wim hof breathing mostly and after one round people say you get light headed but for me “light-headed” is the WRONG term. It’s way way more than that. You actually feel good. By good I mean you feel an intense sense of calm, inner peace and most importantly your breathing become deep—you gain control of your breathing. I’ve been light headed before; like when you smoke a cigarette, or when alcohol just hits you. That’s getting light-headed. With breathing techniques like the Wim Hof technique, it’s nothing like the “light-headed” effect you get from smoking a cigarette or taking alcohol . It’s actually in a weird way completely contrastive to that. You have full control. I don’t know...just my thoughts. What do you think?"

Just because people were using Zoom for teletherapy with no issues before the crisis does not mean it is right to do so now that the COVID crisis has revealed so many flaws in Zoom.   First of all, all those points you just mentioned are preventative measures. Taking those steps will guarantee some level of security, but as I mentioned, taking those preventative measures still does not change the fact that Zoom is unsafe and dangerous. If you’re not living under a rock or are not completely blinded by your bias, you will realize that huge companies with tens of thousands of companies have banned Zoom. As this crisis continues, these companies are relying heavily on web conferencing in order to function. Web conferencing has become extremely vital to their survival. I’m pretty sure they have dedicated a large number of resources and money ; only after this dedication have they come to the conclusion that Zoom is not safe, hence making the decision to ban it. Multiple US attorneys and school districts including some of the largest ones such as the ones in New York have banned Zoom after investigating the company and its security measures. Are you trying to say that you’re more qualified than them in establishing how safe and not safe Zoom is? I can type out a dozen different articles that establishes to what extent Zoom is under attack right now. These things don’t just happen because they happen. There are major problems.

Psychonaut,fhygye6,t3_f59ven,1581975691.0,"Hmm...yes, I’ve usually had the thought of morality about eating animals pop into my head when I’m super high on edibles. Usually, it disgusts me and I stop eating meat for a week or so after the experience; then, I’m back to eating meat again as I get back into the daily grind of life. This is my theory or take on what happens: during the high, the neocortex becomes highly active, and rational thought consequently supersedes the wants and needs of primal part of the brain, the limbic system. Now remember, humans have been eating meat for hundreds of thousands of years, and the limbic system has become accustomed to that. So finally, when that high is over and the cortex returns back to its “deactivated” state, the limbic system goes back to being in control of the brain’s reward systems, which meat obviously has a huge role. I also think that nurture has a big role in all of this. For example, a villager who has grown up in the village, owning a few chickens and cows and goats, whom he occasionally slaughters, would not really see the wrong in killing and eating the animals. After all, those animals are probably given a good life in the village farm before their day arrives. However, the typically urbanite who has eaten meat his or her whole life but has never even seen let alone actually slaughtered an animal for its meat, would probably be disgusted if he or she had to kill an animal. That’s where the nurture part comes in. However, I’m sure that if you transplanted that urbanite to a village and taught him about how to care for an animal before finally slaughtering it for its meat for many years, the urbanite( who would now be used to it), would perhaps not be disgusted at all, and perform the act of killing the animal with no problemo. So this is a complex issue, and it is really an issue that is the product of the society we have been brought up in and the values and norms that have been instilled in us around the treatment of animals, members of the natural world around us."
