The statistical reality is that US and South Korea are tied 2nd for number of tests run and have similar infection rates, but Italy actually did the most tests and they had the worst number of infections until the US recently surpassed them. 

So yeah, if you test more you will find even more covid-19. This is why experts are discussing keeping shutdown until we can mass test and contact trace like South Korea, as we've seen them and Japan struggle to reopen despite really good contact tracing systems.
