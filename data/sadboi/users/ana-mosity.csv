mentalhealth,f3lsc4r,t1_f3ks9a2,1570979055.0,Exactly! You gotta catch me in the moment or else it‚Äôs so hard to explain..
mentalhealth,f3j1ath,t3_dh28af,1570945393.0,"Yup. Whenever I get rejected, or more like feel like I‚Äôm being rejected, I completely rage. All I feel is a deep, loathing anger. Then, a period of dissociation, depression and isolation. All part of my BPD so I‚Äôm told, stemming from the severe emotional neglect I suffered in childhood. Have you talked to a counsellor or psychologist about this?"

My boyfriend of 3 years was always super frustrated when I didn‚Äôt want to have sex (which was almost always), which I understand. I am grey-ace, a form of asexuality. It took me a long to time to realize that it wasn‚Äôt a hormone imbalance, there wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with me, it was just who I am. Perhaps you are going through something similar? I would just talk to your hubby and really voice how you feel."

I felt disgusted and regretful every time we had sex. We ended up splitting. There was nothing we could do unfortunately. You could try counselling, but seeing as your long distance it might be difficult. I really do hope it works out for you though!! Good luck to both of you no matter what happens"

Of course I feel upset about it sometimes, but I appreciate the effort he makes. He comes to church once a month and comes on special occasions like Christmas, Easter etc. I‚Äôve never asked him to do so but I really love that he does! It makes me feel like he really respects my beliefs and is willing to make that sacrifice for me. We also do prayer and he sits in for ‚Äòbible time‚Äô with my daughter, although he does not participate in the readings or anything he sits through. I felt that this compromise really works for us. Ask what compromises you can make with her to make her happier!"
