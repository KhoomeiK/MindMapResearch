The key fundamental here is understanding that there are infinitely many realities where everything has already been created. None can be destroyed. It's the one you tap into. And, with that assumption, we typically believe that all the parties involved are also being benefited by our desire and manifestation.

So in this case you seem very bothered by the fact someone manifested a married person - but, the person who manifested the married person most likely wished for the child and significant other to also be happy with the new reality  \[also keep in mind there still exists a reality where that child and parent is still with the married person happily together\] - maybe the reality that was manifested where the family broke up was because in the given one, they weren't happy - marriage was loveless, etc. make sense?"

nevillegoddardsp,fph1ni3,t1_fpgz308,1588613382.0,"They're all fundamentally the same -  they're all pushing the same concept of your assumptions/beliefs/story will manifest into reality as long as you focus on what YOU want to happen and FEEL like it already has.  The main difference I see is the verbiage amongst the three Laws I'll be mentioning below.

`“if you believe, it’s happening”, which is not EXACTLY the case.`

Actually, this *is* the case. Your beliefs govern your life. The more you pay attention to something, the likelier it will come about in your reality because that is what you're dominantly focusing on. That's why both LO Assumption or LO Attraction or LO Belief all say you need to remove the negatives, the doubts, the contradictions - don't react to the things you don't want, etc.

With all that being said - I personally don't mesh well with Law of Attraction because of the whole ""free will exists. If you don't get what you want, you'll just get better, it's fine"" uh - no. it is not fine. I want what I want and so I will receive. (This is why I prefer Neville) Law of assumption has garnered a mindset where they sugarcoat things and don't push it's followers to persist in their desires. I haven't really followed Joseph Murphy to say much on his subreddit (:

Of course not! Didn't think your comment was negative/came from hate at all <3 I *assumed* it was coming from a good place ;) Cause in my reality, everyone is happy, healthy, whole and go lucky :)

But yes - I can see your sentiment. When I first learned about manifesting, I couldn't wrap my mind around ""do whatever you want and it'll come true""...but, ultimately that really is what we are doing - you can do absolutely whatever it is necessarily for you to get into a mindset where you believe that everything works out for you. Be it SATS, meditation, Scripting - heck, if you strongly believe skinny dipping in your neighbors pool makes you feel like that act alone gets you to a desire, then why not xD

I hope it all makes sense. <3"
