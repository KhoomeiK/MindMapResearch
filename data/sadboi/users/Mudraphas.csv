It is already well documented that some people can carry the virus without showing symptoms and fatally infect other. No matter how careful any lay-person is, if everyone around them is spreading the virus, eventually they will get infected."

He spends his days either taking care of the properties or his very disabled, elderly mother. It’s also just the one property that he needs to pay the mortgage on. The game sucks, but I can’t blame him for being caught in it just like everybody else."

You still have to bake in reasonable portions and might need to adjust baking times for larger or smaller portions, but the basic proportions of the recipe will still be the same."

TheLastAirbender,fnx3vl6,t3_g4ejso,1587330967.0,"A lot of the differences are rooted in the mixing of styles in LoK. After the end of the war, cultures started to mix, especially in Republic City. This changed the traditional styles of bending and integrated various forms and techniques across elements. Uncle Iroh talked about learning from other bending styles when he was teaching Zuko how to redirect lightning. Waterbenders took inspiration from earthbenders to move solid ice blocks more effectively; earthbenders took inspiration from waterbenders to bend metal; and firebenders took inspiration from waterbenders to bend lightning. Airbenders took inspiration from all others because the distinctive style had nearly died out."

linguistics,fnfa4h7,t3_g1fh16,1586904220.0,"I’m guessing the Great Vowel Shift is to blame. Many of these words were probably pronounced this way hundreds of years ago, but the massive shift in vowels left another sound attached to the letters. Frankly, this is one of the reasons why English spelling is so screwy. Later, words borrowed from languages that didn’t experience massive changes in there vowel sets or whose romanized orthography was developed later keep the letter “a” attached to a more traditional sound."
