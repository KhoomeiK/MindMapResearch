If it is a valid replacement, it will not only take away the efficacy issues with the atypicals, but work synergistically with the Adderall. Just something to consider.

Funny, I guessed Quetiapine was one of them. I take it as well, for sleep. So the Quetiapine will definitely still affect the Adderall, but if you take it earlier in the evening to allow more time between it, and your Adderall dose, it will have less of an effect. It only has a half life of 6 hours, so compared to things like Abilify, with a half life of 72 hours, Quetiapine will be much less of an issue. Latuda is somewhat similar.

If you take either one with the Adderall, you will get much less efficacy from the Adderall. It really comes down to your personal needs. If you absolutely need both of the atypical antipsychotics, then you'll just need to get what you can from the Adderall, and be ok with it. 

Personally, I'm titrating off of the Quetiapine. Partly because it'll help my Adderall to work better, but also because it has some serious side effects from long term use. I've found that taking Uridine helps, not only with Adderall efficacy, but with many of the same things that Quetiapine helped with, so I'm not too worried about stopping.

adderall,fjvvd8m,t3_ff4r12,1583631523.0,"For me, when I first started I noticed a lot of benefit. But I also had extreme issues with anxiety, so much of the benefit was lost. It also would randomly make my anxiety worse. Over a few years of trying different treatment angles with various medications, I was able to find a combo that helped long term with the anxiety issues. Then I added my Adderall back in. It was incredible. It worked better than it ever had previously, and my quality of life instantly went up dramatically. Sure there were ups and downs over time, but I learned from each one.

Aside from that instant and pervasive increase in quality of life, over the years I have noticed steady increases in many areas. Now that my brain has the necessary neurotransmitter components in place, I'm able to better focus on skills, habits, and purposeful mental frameworks that allow me to interact with the world in a way that I never thought I would be able to.

I used to dread living. Every morning I woke up filled with despair, because I felt so far behind everyone else. I always felt that, internally, I was intelligent as I could understand most things I put my mind to. I excelled at taking tests because the environment allowed me to be free of distraction. But I was beyond terrible with time management, and any kind of organization, so I was awful with homework. I had minimal ability when it came to expressing what I knew, especially in fast moving interactions with people. Interactions were difficult because I struggled the most with recall. It seems that before I had Adderall, my brain just didn't have what it needed to encode my memories with proper retrieval cues. So I could only remember things I had learned if I had some stimulus for the information. I remember being so embarrassed when I had moments of clarity when I was able to express my ""intelligence"" in an interaction with someone, and they would be so shocked because they always thought I was just a shy idiot. You wouldn't believe how often this kind reaction happened. It was always a reminder that I was trapped in a physical shell that locked me away from the rest of the world.

I think one of the important things to remember is that once you start getting benefit from Adderall, it's now up to you to continue to improve. If you can organize your life and create smart goals, challenge yourself, and learn to enjoy the process of studying, learning, making mistakes and then learning from them as well, without being hard on yourself, you will accomplish things you never thought yourself capable of."

&#x200B;

It's true that Vitamin C (**ascorbic acid**) and citric acids can impact absorption levels of Adderall. But it's not because these are somehow unique, it's because they affect your stomach's **pH level**.

**Acidifying Agents**

Any **Gastrointestinal acidifying agents** such as guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, ammonium chloride etc. will affect pH level towards acidity. Adderall that is already in your blood can be affected by **urinary acidifying agents** such as  ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc, and increase the concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion. Adderall **absorption and efficacy is always worse in acidic environments** (low pH) compared with basic environments (high ph).

**NOTE:** It is unclear if the urinary acidifying agents remove Adderall levels already in the blood, or are preventing absorption in the way that GIAA are. Though as far as I can tell, they **are** lowering the level that is already in the blood.

**Alkalinizing Agents**

These groups of agents increase blood levels and therefore potentiate the actions of amphetamines.

**Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents** such as sodium bicarbonate increase the absorption of amphetamines.

**Urinary alkalinizing agents**  such as acetazolamide, and some some thiazides increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion.

\-Other alkalinizing agents:   potassium citrate, calcium carbonate, sodium lactate and calcium acetate

&#x200B;

A pH of 7 is neutral. So for best absorption rates of Adderall, you'll want to try to **eat foods that are closer to 7 pH**. The problem is that most foods tend to be acidic.  [Check out this list](https://www.pickyourown.org/ph_of_fruits_and_vegetables_list.htm) of the pH levels of common foods if you want to create a diet that will be more synergistic with your Adderall.

Remember that you can also take things like Chelated Magnesium (400mg daily, 200mg at the same time as Adderall, and 200mg halfway through the day), Memantine (prescription, 5-20mg daily), and Tums (helps due to pH level increase), all of which will help with either absorption or general efficacy.

&#x200B;

**Grapefruit Juice:** This is a strange one, because though it is acidic, it contains flavonoids called  *furanocoumarins.*

These active materials inhibit a key [enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme) ([cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) [isoform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoform) [CYP3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4)) which is responsible (among other activities) for drug metabolism. The effect happens in two ways.

One is that grapefruit can block the hepatic [CYP3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) thereby affecting the medication metabolism. If the drug is not metabolized, then the level of the drug in the blood can become too high, leading to an [adverse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect).

On the other hand, if the medication is provided as a [pro-drug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) \[Gina notes: Vyvanse is a pro-drug\], compromising its metabolism may prevent the drug from being created, thereby reducing its therapeutic effect.

The other effect is that grapefruit can block the enterocyte [CYP3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) thereby affecting the medication absorption in the intestine. Absorbing the medication to a lesser extent means it may not reach a therapeutic level. Therefore, its effect may be compromised.

**In other words, grapefruit juice can be a problem in two big ways: (note the context for this explanation is for all meds, not just stimulants)**

1. Create a toxic too-high dose of the medication
2. Reduce the medication’s therapeutic effect."

In addition, methylphenidate doesn't produce the same level of euphoria that is experienced in adderall. Not to mention the entire context of me using euphoria in is based off of the noticeable ""high"" that people get in the first few days of adderall use.

>The euphoria may not be as intense as it was initially but it is likely still there, even if it goes unnoticed.

The entire point is focused on noticeable euphoria. The issue is about when people think the adderall stops working when they **no longer notice the euphoria**. You seem to have managed to miss the entire point.

&#x200B;

>There is a reason why supplement websites often say things like ""these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA are not intended to be used in the diagnosis of any disease""-- so they don't get sued, because people are responsible for the health advice they give to others.

These effects are likely required to elicit its full benefit in ADHD.

Your study doesn't even mention euphoria. You're basically saying that dopamine plays a role in Adderall's benefits for ADHD, which is already well established.

&#x200B;

Of course that's a factor with memantine, just like it is for just about every medication available. It's crucial that people do their own research on the medications they take. Implying that the fault from incorrectly using a medication and not doing their own due diligence, lies with the person who made the individual aware of the medication, is simply ridiculous.

On this note, I'll agree with you. I wrote the post with little time and accidentally added it from a list that I had been looking over.

In the end, I agree with a lot of what you have to say about the research, as far as it not being as good as we would like. But i'm showing what research has been done. People can go over it themselves and decide if it's something they want to do. Also, anecdote doesn't make something invalid, it's just something we can't confirm with the same confidence as information from proper studies. As someone who appears to be educated in this area, i'm sure you're aware of the limits of even the best studies. They're hardly an absolute.

&#x200B;

>you cannot just recommend drugs that don't have great evidence behind them for the conditions you think they'll treat

If psychiatrists and other doctors, who are the highest authority for recommending drugs, are also recommending most of what I have written, I think it's fine if I pass the information along. You're right about a lot of the information about the quality of studies, but you seem to think that pharmacology in general is founded on absolutes. Medications **always** come with downsides. Most medications are essentially a shotgun approach, as we can't simply narrow a medications effect to specifically treat only the symptoms we want. People take risks if it can improve their quality of life. That's exactly what we're doing by taking Adderall. If people want to research a supplement and use it based off of the information available, they have every right to do that. Many people already have, and benefit from it. Sure it's anecdotal that I've received the benefit I have from taking certain supplements. That doesn't change the fact that I have still have the benefits.

It all comes down to the issue of people needing to do their own research, and doing what they think is best for their own lives."

adderall,fjhss5l,t1_fjhao54,1583354395.0,"***First off, remember that this is only my opinion, based off of my experiences with Adderall (IR and XR), Vyvanse, and Concerta (as well as instant release Ritalin).*** 

There are a few ways to look at them:

**Short Term Weekly Breaks**

* ***You shouldn't take breaks cold turkey:*** In one perspective you shouldn't be taking weekly breaks due to the negative side effects of stopping the medication so quickly. According to the official recommendations for using the medication, you are supposed to use it daily. If you are going to stop, you are supposed to titrate off.
* ***Short term breaks are fine and can provide tolerance benefits for some:***  If you either don't have anything you need to get done, or only experience mild side effects, you're probably fine to take the weekends (whenever your ""weekends"" are) off. Some people notice benefit from weekly breaks, while others don't. 

**Long Term Breaks**

* ***Do you have health factors that make Adderall less effective?*** This depends completely on the individual. Personally I have had varying results. I have had periods of time, while taking Adderall, that have allowed me to take tolerance breaks without impacting my professional life. I have had **varying results** in terms of benefits. I haven't been able to isolate the factors as to why breaks of the same length of time can lead to both no tolerance benefit, as well as great tolerance benefit. The basic science behind homeostasis in the brain says that it should be beneficial. Some people claim to metabolize Adderall faster than normal, and that they also gain tolerance faster than most. Though I can't remember the specific details, I am aware certain genes have been identified which can impact multiple factors related to amphetamine metabolism and overall efficacy. While it's certainly possible some individuals may have this, it's also possible that they aren't able to correctly discern cognitive benefit from the noticeable euphoria and energy.
* ***Is Adderall necessary in the first place?*** If the individual can afford to take long term breaks from Adderall with minimal impact to their professional and personal life, it's my suspicion that they don't really need Adderall in the first place. These people are generally using stimulants as more of a tool to get ahead as a shortcut, than as a medication that dramatically increases one's quality of life and success. Of course **this is a spectrum**, and **my intention isn't to make judgements**, rather observations of two extremes on the spectrum. But as for simply asking if it's possible to have tolerance benefit from long tolerance breaks, I would say absolutely. With the caveat of a large variation of the amount of benefit due to the  numerous factors that will play into this, such as diet, exercise, overall health, and many others that are more nuanced.

&#x200B;

Other mainstream reasons for taking both weekly or long term breaks are sometimes fueled by fear of the potential damage caused by long term Adderall use. It's up to the individual to determine whether they can see benefits from weekly breaks. Personally, I prefer using various supplements with Memantine to deal with tolerance and damage mitigation. I take Adderall everyday and haven't noticed any tolerance to cognitive benefit for the last 2 years. I have noticed that I no longer feel like i'm on Adderall, and it feels completely  normal at this point for me. As I have slowly added Uridine, Inositol, Alpha GPC, Fish Oil and L-Tyrosine to my stack, I have noticed greatly increased cognition. Whether that's from improving the effects of Adderall, or simply from their own benefit, it's hard to say. It's likely that they are all synergistic in multiple ways, which are greatly increased by Uridines activation of the P2Y2 receptor.

***NOTE: Uridine, Choline supplements, and Fish Oil (high in DHA) have been found to be greatly synergistic. When comparing using them together vs individually, the data shows that the benefit of the combination is far greater than when combining the data of each used individually.***

&#x200B;

My main takeaway point for long term tolerance breaks is that **if you are able to take them with minimal impact to your life, you probably don't need Adderall in the first place**. But if your life is heavily impacted by taking a long term break, you **may** be better off and have better reduction of tolerance using Memantine and supplements anyways.

&#x200B;

Of course this is all just my opinion. I'm curious, what do you think about tolerance breaks/ drug holidays?"

While it often refers to an attack that is intentionally orchestrated by the ""brigade"", whose members consist of separate people, it's also sometimes used to refer to sockpuppet tactics, in which people create extra user accounts for the purpose of acquiring more voting power (this in particular is very very much against reddit rules), or simply an unplanned circlejerk of downvotes against a particular user or community.""

I don't think that being an RN takes away from the validity of what you said in the post, nor do I think that being an RN necessarily provides much expertise in general with pharmacology. 

But in the post all you were saying was that an individual's experience is going to differ, so there is little value in taking the opinion of someone who says your dose is too low or too high. So I agree that, assuming you are perceptive, as an RN, that is exactly the type of thing you will likely be more aware of than the average person. Though there are many people who experience the same symptoms and signs when their adderall dose is too high, there is still enough uncertainty, due to the complexity all of the factors involved, for deciding not to take the advice of a stranger.

On the other hand, I do think there can be **some** benefit from simply reading the vast amount of anecdotal experience as a way to get a generalized picture of peoples experiences on a larger scale. If anything, that will show you how varied people's experiences are. 

In the end, the most important things someone who is worried about their dose can do, is to first allow mental stability over a period of time by not adding and taking away numerous supplements and medications. Once they have established a baseline, they can start adding things in one at a time and observe the intricacies of how they are effected, though it's often easier said than done."
adderall,fjezuzc,t1_fjextqh,1583281336.0,"I just showed my doctor the research on the benefits of Memantine when taken with Adderall. There are a few factors be mindful of:

* Does your doctor think you are exhibiting drug seeking behavior? If so, you may want to tell them that you are planning to supplement Uridine as well, which protects your brain from abusing stimulants by preventing the brain from being overstimulated. Even if your doctor thinks you are abusing, a script for Memantine would only do you good.
* If your doctor is not worried about drug seeking behaviors, you should be fine to just request it. It's not a controlled substance, and is relatively safe. You can frame the request in a way that tells your doctor that the namenda will prevent you from having to increase your Adderall dose, and that you won't have to worry as much about long term damage. That should be more than enough for your doctor to feel comfortable prescribing it.

In addition to the adderall benefits, it has general benefits for learning and memory through increased neuroplasticity. For some doctors, that alone will be enough.
