I've found that for many years, I've met more meaningful social interactions with people I've met on MMOs than in real life.  (I'll say this loosely of course, because a lot of MMOs have toxic people in it, but then again so does social media in general.  There are some MMOs that are more team spirited than others though.)  If you're into video games, that's a really good way to casually meet people, hang out with them on a regular basis if you're going on raids or missions together, and sometimes you end up getting close to them.

I don't mean to be rude and not answer them, and I feel bad when I decide not to, but those kinds of interactions stress me out.  Not sure if this is the same playing field as what you're talking about.  
I guess the huge turn off for me is I've met some people who are so needy and constantly need to talk to someone or hang out every single day, and I've just never been that kind of person - I need ""me"" time to de-stress, and also don't want that kind of commitment where I have to worry about other people getting mad if I don't talk to them - it makes me feel weighed down. There's only one person that isn't my boyfriend or family that I talk to regularly.  Anyone who has known me long enough knows that's just how I am and don't take offense to it, and I don't get offended when I'm not invited to parties or anything.

That being said, if we want to derail a tiny bit and question why this woman would do that - we would need more information, but, on top of already being offended, I would be even more or less as offended(but still offended) depending on context- say, for example, I would find it especially douche if OP's husband was one of the cops on top of being skipped *because* they don't have children.  I'd be a little less offended otherwise if my husband was apart of the department but not a cop(telecommunicator, civilian records employee) because maybe she only wants fellow police officers and their kids in the album.

doggrooming,fq9mt5j,t3_ghmiuw,1589202492.0,"I worked 5 different shops - each were different.  I'll list 3 of them.  None of these work places compensated for cleaning - it was expected of you in vary degrees, but all had different expectations.

&#x200B;

Shop #1 - mom and pop - all workers(bathers and groomers) came an hour before opening to clean and sanitize the kennels and grates. (Regardless if you were a groomer getting paid commission, or the bather getting paid hourly, we all had to do it.)  We did not book hourly there - we took all appointments in the morning and discharged as the day went on.  At the end of the bather's work day(me at the time, after washed and dried everyone for the groomers), I vacuumed the floors, took garbage out, and picked up after the boarding dogs in the yard before going home.  So pretty much the groomers didn't have to do much of anything except help clean kennels(lot of times they'd quit half way.)  Mopping floors were the owners responsibility(when they felt like it).(Side note: position opens up, I've been able to groom for a long time now, and I can finally take the grooming position, rules change lmao because fuck me, right?)

&#x200B;

Shop #2 is corporate.  The list of end shift responsibilities were a page long, but it was pretty much take out garbage, clean, sanitize, and vacuum everything from floor to ceiling within an inch of its' life before you go home.  The entire department.  Which sucked when you're the closing shift (10 hour shifts across the board) because day shift just got to clean their stations and leave.  They paid me as a groomer hourly there.  They had me alone at night - so it took me about an hour AFTER my shift before I could go home.

Shop #3 is my absolute favorite - mom and pop - the owner is well off and took care of us in that we only had to clean and sanitize our work stations as groomers, and the bathers only had to vacuum the hair off the floor in the wash bay and get the wet hair off the floor.  She had cleaning services for everything else.  


If you can - try and find shop #3.  They seem like unicorns in the field, but they do exist and pay well."

I just feel that your willingness to be supportive of her(which, assuming she'll feel bitter about this, would be financially, not emotionally) after a divorce, will some how bite you in the ass and spiral into different problems down the line.  Example, and I don't know how divorce agreements work, but say, ""Ok, I'll keep the house, and I'll help pay for a flat for you"" could cascade into ""well I can't afford this now and this now"" and bam you're paying for diapers when baby daddy doesn't pay child support, not just for a year, but forever.  What if she doesn't respect your agreements or have the same mentality as you?  Then, wouldn't it have just been cheaper to stay together and raise this kid now? That's what I'm thinking, anyway.

When I first started my current job - I would spend so much time with outfits, my hair, and makeup because of my worrying about presentation.  It wasn't until I got more comfortable with myself being there that I stopped with the makeup, maybe not straighten my hair every day, wear more comfortable clothes and losing the body shaper that people, especially the guys, started coming up to me more and having conversations with me.

This experience gave me the impression that people can read when someone is concerned about looks - because you give off body language that could inadvertently make you come off as unapproachable for one reason or another, IE uptight, vein, etc.  Whereas when you look comfy, it can vibe out and make the other people around you feel more comfy about themselves too, and more inclined to be themselves with you more.

rant,fig54g3,t3_f7tvy6,1582396256.0,"I feel it's a matter of chemistry between personalities, past experience, and how close you are to that person.    


As an example, I'm the kind of person with below average self esteem and a dark sense of humor, and I feel more comfortable around people I'm just getting to know who can make fun of themselves like this, because past experience has these situations come off to me as they being in touch with their feelings and being more empathetic, as well as being less likely to be judgmental.  On the flip side, I'm uncomfortable around people who act like they're above average confident, like almost bossy like, and too positive, because past experience has me associate those kinds of personalities as being more quick to pass judgement and having less empathy.  Then there's the kind of person who is the complete opposite of me, and find the opposite to be true.

That being said, these are, of course, my bias perception of people, that we each have and use when we're interacting with people.  Personalities are a lot more complex than that once you really get to know someone, but I'm talking about when it's a friend of a friend you don't really know, or the beginning stages of breaking the ice with someone.

In the end, I think that's why there are different genres of friend groups around, and this person just may not be your cup of tea.  To me they sound like mine."

Add insult to injury, there's no such thing as paid sick days, let alone sick days at all, so now you lose money not coming to work.  Do this more than once or twice - you're fired.

So, here's a dog with not enough training, under exercised and under stimulated from the parents being too preoccupied having a kid, stressed out and anxious from being around stressed out and anxious people, and gets yelled at for doing what dog's naturally do to relieve stress, which is chew on things, and then gets barred in a small prison for 8 hours alone in the home.

I really think you would have had a much better adjustment and better opinion in the long term if you and your parents had moved to one of our coasts.  You're talking completely different ways of life depending on where in the states you are.  I've been to Illinois, I have family there - you're in corn country.  When we refer to ""the country"", that's one of the states you're in, where everything is 40 minutes apart, the lifestyle is slower, laid back, takes their time.  My biggest gripe is Illinois and a lot of other midwest states chain their dogs outside or make them live in dog houses, and leave them there in all weather all day and all night, where by us that's animal cruelty.

This would especially be super easy if the door has the kind of hinges that uses pins.  If it's just screws, that's no big deal anyway because the holes are in the molding to begin with, so you're not modifying anything that isn't already there.

 Just noticed you added that 2nd part within 2 minutes to avoid the edit timestamp, so I'll reply to this also -  Bullshit.  


Now I need to teach you the definition of what snooping is.  Snooping, would be if he actually took her private property, opened it up without permission, and looked at it.  He looked at her public profile on an app.  That's not snooping.  That's like calling me a scumbag for looking up someone's facebook profile.  You're wrong.  


 You're ignoring ""intent"" and ""degrees"".  You can't group both of these people in this scenario as equal and the same and now after the fact call them both scumbags, when the severity/degrees of what has happened is opposite ends of the scale.  Stringing someone along and lying to them while looking for other guys, cannot compare to feeling like someone is emotionally hurting you, and thus looking up the fucking facts to protect yourself.  The fact that you *initially* focused all of your disgust and anger towards whom clearly is the victim in this situation regardless of the fact that he clearly did not do it out of malice, tells me someone has looked at your phone once and you're all bent out of shape."
