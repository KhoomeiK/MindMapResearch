Twitch,fg5ele8,t3_ewyg65,1580525393.0,"So, if you like a different of games, I'd recommend not necessarily switching around all in one night. I find that does way worse for you.

For example, I play Overwatch and DbD a lot. When I first started I mostly did Overwatch and made friends who enjoy the game too BUT I really enjoy RPG/open world and simulators. I also create artwork and do commissions for other streamers so this makes my stream hugely varied. 

Instead, I have set days. I have a day I focus on a story game I'm playing (eg currently AC Odyssey), I have evenings I play Overwatch/DbD, I stream art through the day when I'm working as normal and a set day for Stardew Valley. I find it does much better, as people who follow as a specific fan know when to expect each game or art. Or those who drop by simply because I've created friendships know when I'll be around!"

gaming,febx2b2,t3_eodl36,1578963711.0,DayZ? It isn't as good on Xbox/PS in comparison to PC but you can RP and it's open world and survival.
xboxone,febr60t,t3_eod55f,1578961773.0,"I'd say yes, but also depends what games you enjoy. I get ultimate as I play between xbox and PC, alone its worth it for me for Dead By Daylight as I play often with a group of friends but then I got to play Outer Worlds on release without worry for funds for RRP, same for Gears 5. I've since worked my way through a couple other games in their catalogue and still will!"

Twitch,fe6au39,t3_ennmay,1578885721.0,"Try and find supportive discord communities, get to know other streamers but because you want to not because you're fishing for your own views, post on social media's like Instagram is great for stream clips, game clips and so on, Twitter you can get involved on chatting to other streamers. Don't pay for advertisement."

Twitch,fcivcjf,t3_ehdyv5,1577670703.0,"I have mine set to related to games I play often on my stream more than anything. Example, I play Dead by Daylight so for x amount of points people can pick my character or load out. I have some silly ones where I have to hide in lockers whenever it's redeemed and so on.

I'm eventually going to add some giveaway ones but not necessarily things of monetary value - more a little handmade sketch and note digitally or hand drawn and shipped for more."

furry,fb5kim8,t1_fb5k0wu,1576529329.0,"I can work for hours without getting bored so I'm okay there, this is I guess you would call a ""side hussle"" I create a variety of art from digital things (for streamers, logo designs, full pieces, so on) and just adding more really.

Tax I needn't worry as I'm UK and you have to earn over a certain threshold per annum for it to be taxable/a self-employable business.

I definitely would use the same base and different colour variations for the most part. I'm more for creating from the base up to the commissioners liking.

Just trying to guage where to start and so forth really, so thought I'd wander the depths of reddit."
Twitch,f7xqf3v,t3_dxyk1z,1574069864.0,"I started from Twitch app on Xbox and a chat mic and got a good half of my community before I even used a PC. I used a borrowed PC that could barely run OBS for long periods, webcam and webcam mic and only now upgraded to what would be considered a ""good"" set up. Its certainly doable."
mentalhealth,f6v2lj7,t1_f6v1ypv,1573174956.0,"110% relate. I've just come out the other side of a really bad spell and I can't look at myself or my house today. Tomorrow I'll shower and clean myself. The day after, I'll clean the house. And it honestly feels like it's in preparation for ""next time"" at this point.

One change I'm making is seeking out help, regardless of anxieties and not taking a side palm answer. Medication helps me find that zazz to get out of bed, brush my teeth and brush my hair for a while but then there's nothing else. Nobody for me to talk to, nobody to help me figure out my situation and move from it because I certainly can't do that on my own, I've tried and it's resulted in spells of being bed bound. I'm tired of that continuing at this point."

 I'm a little useless of how Reddit works though beyond commenting on posts, I'll be honest! üòÇ"
Twitch,f5sy4rv,t1_f5sxs23,1572446046.0,"It takes a little but I usually wire it all through the PC (working via a TV and one monitor right now which is a pain in the butt) otherwise same problem, I have my speakers rolling out which is a no go.
I tend to use the Xbox Companion App for party over the console as I can feed it through that way. I had a couple issues when I picked up my stream mic getting my headset mic to work on it at first but that's just been a pain from the get go. üòÇ"

Twitch,f5swv9d,t3_dp066a,1572445176.0,"Yes and no.

It can bring in a lot of different viewers, and keeps content fresh in my opinion, as you'll gain people who are fans of the games /series you are playing. Of course people will stop by for just you too.
I'm the same breathe though, some won't stop by as they aren't a fan of the other games you are playing.

Quite frankly I variety stream between a mix of games and art streams. I have people who drop by for art who don't for games and vice versa, but it's a hobby and some fun for me so I don't mind either way."
Twitch,f20i41l,t3_dbbqeo,1569859980.0,"Not profitable.
Think of it as an in person networking opportunity. And to meet people who are already your friend.

I'm going so I can meet fellow streamers I already know as well hopefuwmakd many new friends."
