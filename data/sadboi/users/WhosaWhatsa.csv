I engineer variables more appropriately after these conversations. My dashboards are more used after these conversations. My models generally yield better metrics after these conversations. My work is more appreciated.

Started with some basic cleaning and transformations to align with business processes. Then to a collinearity assessment since all IVs are continuous and a best subset algorithm using AIC as a selection criteria. 

Then onto a supervised clustering using a recursive partitioning decision tree just to help stakeholders understand some useful ways to think about their customer base. Helped build a tableau dash for each terminal leaf which seems like an effective way for your stakeholders to do some EDA after they see their business processes in terms of decision tree logic. They can assign names to the resulting terminal leaves and it engages them a bit more. 

Now I'm using a random forest for prediction but I think we may need to access another database with more time-based behavioral data of customers. The AUC is not all that impressive for the RF and I think this other database may have what we need.
