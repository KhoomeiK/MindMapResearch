The recent activites that show gta dont show any text and are very different than the others and when i click on it it says an error has occured. I tried making a post to have an invite to play gta to all but gta doesnt show up on the ""tag a game"" list. I have a feeling gta is bugged on the home screen but it still shows up and i am able to play it, just not look at recent activites regarding it and others.

You only get one life and hindi worth it magpakamatay. Kung gusto may paraan, and kung ayaw maraming dahilan. One thing I can tell you is marami akong kilala na mas worse situation pa kesa sayo, pero nakaahon sila. Pray ka lang, and kung hindi ka man Catholic or naniniwala sa Diyos, just trust the process. Tulungan ka sana ni Lord, pagdadasal kita ate, and I'll find someone na pwedeng idirect ka sa abortion or some service na pwedeng ipa abort yung bata. Dont kill yourself please ate :))"
