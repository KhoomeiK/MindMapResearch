I tried making a post to have an invite to play gta to all but gta doesnt show up on the ""tag a game"" list.

You only get one life and hindi worth it magpakamatay. Kung gusto may paraan, and kung ayaw maraming dahilan. One thing I can tell you is marami akong kilala na mas worse situation pa kesa sayo, pero nakaahon sila. Pray ka lang, and kung hindi ka man Catholic or naniniwala sa Diyos, just trust the process. Tulungan ka sana ni Lord, pagdadasal kita ate, and I'll find someone na pwedeng idirect ka sa abortion or some service na pwedeng ipa abort yung bata. Dont kill yourself please ate :))"
