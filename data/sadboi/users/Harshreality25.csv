transmaxxing,f9ew474,t1_f9euy55,1575253104.0,"Still sounds like this whole ""trannymaxxing"" thing is a paradox. You definitely sound like your typical mtf, a lot of their stories match yours. Yup it sounds like self discovery as you stated you didn't enjoy being with a girl..as much, not your sexual orientation changing. Like I said there are too many inconsistencies. I think my case was the epitome of inceldom to ""trannymaxxing"" but I still had and have a glimmer of hope it can change thru other maxxing and believe I don't need to go down that drastic road again to achieve some sort of happiness. I don't think trannymaxxing is efficient at all in getting out of inceldom, I think it'd actually damage and confuse the person even more unless they were already mtf to begin with. Like in my case, I still think about this stuff from time to time but knowing I can't muster up the courage to do it again because I know the severe consequences of it now. I feel like if you're confused and also lonely (which is a deadly combination) this is definitely a no go but if you're willing, ready and able then more power to you I guess."

transmaxxing,f9etlup,t1_f9et5j8,1575251246.0,"Finally a real answer without the hostility and condescending vibes. Though there are some direct contradictions. Even the mod of this sub and thru my own research found that autogynhilia is accepted and transitioning out of inceldom is also accepted and common but you, a self proclaimed ""trannymaxxer"" just stated that in fact these reasons are not a good reason to do it. This whole trannymaxxing thing is very confusing and it's not because I don't get it, it's because there are many inconsistencies and I'm starting to think this sub and this entire niche is a troll or meme or something. So how are you a ""trannymax"" success story when you stated that it's not a good idea to transition for the reasons stated above when even in the incel wikis, it states the opposite to be true? Only one can be true, either you didn't ""trannymax"" and you're just a regular trans person or this whole thing is a fraud."

transmaxxing,f9e9atf,t1_f9e7ygl,1575241110.0,"Okay I get it now. It's just a different perspective. This is where I'm at. It's always in the back of my head but what's stopping me is the what if, what if I could find a girl that's the one for me, or fix my life as a guy and be okay. I know that hasn't been my past nor present but what if I could change that? Transitioning would stop all chances of that. Sure, I can detransition but that takes a tole financially, physically and even emotionally. I'm not talking crap about trannymaxxing because that was essentially what I was doing and admittedly I was a trannymax that was an autogynphilic myself. I did it purely for fetish reasons but I convinced myself other wise and got wrapped up into the whole gender politics of it all. If I went back to that life, I'd have to be sure I'd stay an ""incel"" the new evolved term but that's impossible because I'd never know but then again by thirty years old I would honestly be too jaded and feel like if a girl liked me then I'd feel too old to even wanna pursue anything because  my 20's would've been a waste and a woman wanting me passed 30 would just leave me fucked up and me knowing that I could never experience ""young love"" would mess me up too. I'm 25 but I've seen people transition at that age and pass just fine. I have a face that could, the only thing is my height and frame being 6'0 but as another member told me, I'm in the acceptable height range and with weight redistribution the frame could altered. Either way the jury is not fully out and I don't think it ever will be, unless I was like mid thirties by then if I hadn't done it and I haven't found a girl and a stable life as a dude, then I'd just accept my life the way it is, which would suck. To do it now would, well first I'm not even in the situation and as another member told me it was excuses but he doesn't know me nor my situation and it'd be a dumb move to do it even if I wanted to. To do it now though would make me regret it within a few months, thinking what if I could still live a successful life as a guy."

I just didn't bother putting a question mark because I thought you were going to get the context that it was in, jeez you guys are extremely defensive. I'm not assuming, I'm going by what I've seen so far. The one that didn't do it because of fetish reasons, aren't they just regular trans people? A lot of trans people who didn't do ""trannymaxxing"" were straight conforming guys and not incels. I guess people just choose what label they wanna roll with."

Btw legit question, do you really think transmaxxing works? Are there real examples? I'm not being sarcastic, condescending or anything. I'm legit asking because I looked online and all the ""transmaxxing"" examples like pictures seem like they were just regular mtf trans and it seems like with ""trannymaxxing"", there's a distinction. Is there an actual incel, a regular straight guy that did this and worked? All I see are before and after of people that were clearly just trans from the get go. Transmaxxing seems like a specific niche. Again please don't come at me hostile. It's a real question I wanna know because this trannymaxxing thing seems unheard of.

rant,f9bk5pv,t1_f9bhbwy,1575213480.0,"Well I'm a walking example of the stereotype not being true. I'm 6'0, have tattoos, long hair, you can just tell when you look at me that I don't embody the stereotype. People still choose to stereotype me. Why? Because like I said, it's the lack of respect we've created for our selves. Blacks are very out spoken where as most Asian Americans are not. We really do a disservice to our own when we back up other minorities that don't even back us up. This happens because any time a few Asians speak out, more Asians speak against it saying we're being sensitive and blah blah blah which reverses any progress we could've made in the past and made in the present. It makes people justify and rationalize racism towards Asians in the first place. I disagree and agree when you said we all have a degree of being racist and sexist. It depends what you consider racism and sexism. Preference is not the same thing but I think I get what you mean. I've had a mixture of experiences. I've had older people who were racist and looked at me funny as well, maybe the ones I've encountered carried their ""old school"" mentality with them. The younger generation is more fake. I've hung out with some white boys that hung with a lot of black guys. I'm Asian and I'm not black but when it was just them and I and there was no black person in sight, they'd spout a bunch of racist shit about blacks, calling them jigaboos and what not. These are the same people that had hung out with black people on the regular! It really made me realize how normal racism still is, it's just that it's also normal to hide it."
rant,f9bhb9j,t3_e4b21e,1575212745.0,"The ""rebuttal"" that I hate the most is when people say, ""Asians extremely racist themselves!"" They say that as if Asians deserve the racism we get but not realizing how ignorant and stupid they sound.  There are racists in every race, so in that logic it means we all have the right to be racist toward each other, right? Wrong. Another thing is, most Asians aren't even being racist. It's just Americans are very arrogant and before people get their panties in a twist by Americans I don't mean white people. Anyone from the US can be American just as a disclaimer for those who like to nit pick a comment, rather than seeing the big picture. They think if they aren't following their social ques, then they're being racist. A lot of the older immigrant Asians in western society are in this category. Some of them are actually racist but others just aren't following ""American"" social ques, so it gets pinned as racism. Or if like a black person visits Japan and people touch their hair and people constituting that as racism. That's not racism, that's curiosity, not the same thing. People just say Asians are extremely racist, because that's an easy way to just shove us right back in the background where we always were. A lot of the older generation is misunderstood but I've never met one single young Asian American that was actually blatantly racist. I'm not saying that they don't exist but I've met plenty of young non Asians in America that were clearly racist. hmmm. Asians in America don't even get the proper respect and when we finally show a little bit of needed anger and frustration, we're pinned as racist to reverse the racism. If I get down voted into a cesspool I give two shits. The truth hurts and some times it'll get negative reactions."
rant,f9bey2d,t1_f99k61m,1575212146.0,"True it is black and white in America but emulating other races isn't the answer. The one of the issues Asian Americans face. We lack our own identity here. It's either we sit quiet and do our own thing in our own bubble or we emulate from those we want acceptance from. This is why Asians in Western countries aren't respected because neither or is going to get their respect. Respect is the foundation to everything. This is why our stereotypes are actually believed and for this long. They don't know us. So is easier for them to just believe stereotypes. It's partially our fault, partially due to social conditioning, partially a numbers game and is being one of the smallest minorities in Western countries, that makes an impact on it as well."

You are solely focused on a certain racism for a certain race that you lack awareness or education on others. Asians have been enslaved as well , maybe not to the same extent as blacks in Western countries but why is it anytime a non black person mentions racism it always gets shut down by slavery talk. Also you say blacks are segregated economically, though I completely disagree, even if I did agree, I can say that Asians are segregated socially. Not everything has to do with money."

Even cis gender escorts started having a hard time especially with a lot of sites being shut down, so a lot of them went to camming and for trans women to cam successfully and actually make money, you have to be passable to a degree. I was feminine looking but not passable. I'm sure you know that there's a difference. How would someone make money off of it if they can't get any clients? A lot of guys promised a million things and rarely ever came thru. I've tried to get sugar daddies and all of that, nope didn't work. It's like the concept where you need experience to get a job but you can't get a job without the experience. It was a paradox.

If I was financially stable, in my own living situation, but was still lacking success in the romance and sex department, I might be living a different story right now but it really had nothing to do with the hrt itself. It was my life unrelated to transmaxxing that led me to stop, it was one less thing on my shoulders on top of everything else.

I still have my gyno nips as they don't fully go away as a side effect. I've been off of hrt for almost a year now. I was trying to get the voice, look, body, weight, everything down before the social aspects. I'm not a dummy. I was aware of all this before knowing the transmaxxing term. It was all the in between life stuff that messed me up, jaded from situations not working out like guys promising to helping me out and the employment, financial and living struggles that were unrelated to being trans or ""transmaxxxing."" These hardships made me question if it was all worth it, if there was even a slim chance that I could get a girl, settle down, be financially okay without selling my body.

I've seen more guys blame themselves, even to an unhealthy level then them blaming women for it. I've seen more apologizes towards women for even looking at them or asking them out feeling like they ""knew"" they were out of their league. I just think that SOME people hide behind the reason to call someone that like blaming women but simply call them that as a replacement for ""loser"" or ""virgin.""

He never said that he blamed women for him being fa, not once in this lengthy writing. Blaming and observation is two different things. You have to realize too that being fa for a long time can severely mess with a person's mental health significantly. Yeah he finally found someone that could possibly accept him at 40 years old! I won't say it's too little, too late but it's a lot harder then you make it seem. This isn't a simple just do it kind of thing. Being fa for a lengthy period of time changes your brain's chemistry. So it can be done, but you have to literally rewire your brain, at least for the people in fa that are in the more severe end of it. At 40 years old, he's used to this kind of thinking. It'll take more then just asking ""why not just take it"" approach. For someone who isn't fa, it sounds so simple, just go and do it right?

You're way off base and I'm not even sure why you're on here. You should be on femcel or some other female dominated sub. You sound just like them. I can't even have a discussion with someone that uses straw man argument. This was about how a girl rejected a guy, not about a guy thinking he deserves or is entitled to dating someone. I guess you used that to distract the actual point. Shame logic doesn't work in this scenario, sorry. In my humble opinion as a guy speaking, it feels worse when you're lied to, like you're not good enough to even deserve honesty. Yeah actually you can let someone down easy and still be honest. How is ""hey sorry I'm not interested brutal?"" Is that line that hard to tell someone? I guess to someone that employs your kind of logic, it doesn't really come as a shocker. Do we really live in this cowardly generation. I guess most women are used to either being dishonest when rejecting or just going completely awol and telling them to go to fuck off, that a lot of you don't know what balance is. There is an in between. You can easily tell someone no without sounding like a great big bag of dicks. If you don't know how, then learn. Not everybody has to like you all the time. Some times you have to be the asshole in the situation and most women can't handle that so they lie because it's easier then to feel like an ass. Some how that's the guy's fault for wanting honesty, yeah okay. Yup we should just all appreciate being lied too for their own conscious detox. Yeah...no. A woman calling me a creep on a fa sub, the irony is palpable. I notice a big flux of feminists infiltrating this sub and most of the op's on here don't and can't relate to your type of logic and shame language. Seriously, why are you here?

Oh yeah because if we do we're just cry baby iNcEls. Generalizing an entire gender on BOTH sides is wrong, point blank period. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Most guys don't even blow up when they get rejected, maybe with the exception of a few out of maybe hundreds of guys that get rejected. You guys do do it to spare your own conscious, come on. Playing it safe? Yeah that's not the most over used excuse in the world. Yeah and there's a lot of fast girls these days, yet you wouldn't want us guys assuming that and have every guy treat every girl as such just to ""play it safe."" You can't employ this logic when it only suits you. You have this strange ""treat every guy like he's a rapist just in case"" mentality and that's possibly why you're even here on this sub.

It sounds like you're making excuses for women to have their own subs that excludes men entirely where as men can't ever have their own spaces (not talking about fa by the way). Again, fa is for both women and men so not sure why you're still choosing to argue that point, maybe it's because you have no point. You're using circular logic and it's making you contradict yourself without even realizing it. It doesn't matter what the reason is, but in your logic there are some subs that were specifically made for men because ""women's behaviors drove them to do so"" but I'm sure you think those subs are sexist and ""incels"" am I right or am I right? Furthermore this sub isn't even catered more towards men, it just happens more men deal with this kind of stuff to this extent, get over it. Yet again, you can't have your cake and eat it too.

You also just contradicted yourself by claiming that I'm making it a competition but also admitting what I'm saying is pretty much true by saying there's a reason why this particular sub is dominated by men. So even you know, so what's the issue? At least this sub doesn't out right exclude women and we don't out right shut them out. We sympathize and we talk to them too just like we do with men. My response was only in relation to the post. This isn't even the usual topic of this sub. I've seen plenty of subs where women are heard and listened too but in other subs as you quite clearly admitted, men are shut out and down voted to hell just for not following their narrative and having the same views as them."

ForeverAlone,f8wj4iu,t1_f8wd63g,1574891972.0,"True I agree with that but I think that it's even more so with us men because the fact of the matter is men are more approachable. I hope you don't take this the wrong way and this isn't a competition but it's simply my own observation. It's not in our heads that women are harder to approach. This fa thing doesn't make it any easier. Plus I've noticed a lot of women on fa being fa because the lack of effort. I see posts where they'll say they're too scared to go up to guys and ask them out when 9/10 if they just talked the guys would at least talk to them, even if they get rejected. A lot of times the guy will at least be friends with them, this is from my own third party observations in real life. I rarely see this vice versa though. Most guys on here are even rejected as friends by girls, at least from the posts I've seen. Guys reject girls a little bit differently, let's be honest. A guy for the most part will let a girl down easy because he doesn't wanna look like a great big bag of dicks but I've seen many posts on here where the guy said he was straight up called a loser to his face, laughed at, mocked and etc which I'm sure is not a stellar thing for their confidence which causes them to stay fa, it's a cycle but for girls it seems more like extreme shyness and lack of confidence. Do girls get rejected? Absolutely. Can girls be fa and be just as alone and depressed? Absolutely. This is no competition but let's not kid ourselves, men who are fa have it a lot harder. Even the good looking men complain about how they're treated nowadays and some of them go mgtow which I'm not a mgtow by the way nor do I agree with them. A lot of guys on here are here due to our experiences. I'm sure some girls have similar ones too but it's just not the same is all."
ForeverAlone,f8wim8g,t3_e2mhpy,1574891645.0,"I can get down voted to hell, I don't care but I really think 90 percent of the girls on here are just in their own head. Dating for women is not that hard at all. I've seen so many good looking dudes with below average women, but not a lot vice versa and you know why? I'll tell you why. It's because most men at the end of the day just want a loyal girl to settle down with, despite all this leftist brainwashing that we're all just shallow pigs but most women have this universal standard that if it's not met, they don't even want a platonic relationship. And no this isn't ""iNcEl"" talk which I think the word incel is so over used and toxic. That's another can of worms I won't open but this is just purely my own observations in real life. I think some guys are just insecure as well and their looks aren't what's holding them back BUT I just know that for women it's a lot easier, as long as they're not over weight which is controllable and as long as they're not some psycho. If a guy isn't perfect looking, he better act damn perfect or else it's onto the next one."

ForeverAlone,f8vnion,t1_f8vmtke,1574873412.0,"And it wasn't always like this. In high school, I wasn't a lady magnet by any means, but I had a couple of girlfriends, and we'd respond fast and there was no ""oh I have to wait so I don't seem thirsty."" It was just organic, idk where those lines got blurred but now it's all about technique from guys, and stupid little shit tests from girls, on both sides it's so dumb. It's like if you choose to date in this time period, be prepared for the mental gymnastics. I'm not just saying girls do it, guys do it too but in fairness most guys do it to combat when girls do it. Either way, it's a perpetual cycle. Nothing is organic anymore, it's all about spitting game or saying the right things at the right time, and not just letting it flow like a regular person. I get people do get busy but I genuinely believe a lot of people use that as an excuse, like when people take days to respond and say that line. It's like do I have a sticker on my head that says I'm dumb? So you mean to tell me (not you btw), that you were so busy you had no time to type a few words? Nobody is constantly doing something 24.7. If that's the case how did this person eat, take a shit, brush their teeth, get changed, and get ready to go to sleep. It's all bs. I haven't had a girlfriend in years, and honestly I'm not prepared for any of the shit tests and mental gymnastics that would come my way. I feel like fa has really messed me up to the point of extreme paranoia that if I luck out and some how get another girl friend, I'd screw it all up and shoot myself in the foot. The craziest thing about this whole fa thing is, it's not just in our heads. It's actually not unreasonable for us to believe they will go and find someone else and to think that if they're not texting us within that hour they're losing interest because the truth is, for people like us finding a partner is pure luck, pure happenstance, right place right time kind of thing. So knowing that in the back our minds, knowing just like that they can move onto a thousand guys or girls that are probably better looking, better social wise and better everything, it's enough to make that paranoia grow. Even if I didn't get paranoid and didn't double text or get clingy, because of who we are, let's be honest they would move onto someone else very quickly. Double texting and doing all this clingy stuff just gives them an out without feeling like an asshole, because then they can say the reason they cut us off was because we were too clingy when the truth is if a girl or guy really likes you, they'll give two shits about how many times they text you because it makes them feel desired by their partner, which to most is a good thing. Most of the time even girls will like it unless you go psycho mode and text them 10 times in a row. This whole fa thing doesn't make me overly negative or make me delusional to the real world. It makes me more aware and it confirms what I already know. Fa is the ugly truth for many lonely people out there and some can deal some can't."
