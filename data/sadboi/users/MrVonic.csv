sociopath,fjbedmb,t1_fjb9isl,1583191430.0,"Yea there is no ""pathway"" for which a mood disorder completely goes away and becomes a personality disorder, or you get both of them somehow, especially since their causes are completely different. 

Bipolar is caused by a combination of genetic factors mixed with environmental factors, while bpd has absolutely no link to genetic factors and is only caused by environment, and can only start to form in a child, an adult cannot develop bpd. 

When you say cognition like that, I believe what you're trying to say is (and correct me if I'm wrong) that if someone put their mind to it, they could turn bipolar into bpd, and that's in no way whatsoever how the brain works. By this same logic, someone who doesn't have ASPD can develop it through just simply not wanting to have empathy after a long enough time of thinking like that. 

Comorbidity is indeed widely misunderstood, and therefore I'll leave it alone as I don't like to make completely uneducated guesses. 

When it comes to using meds for mental disorders, no one knows the actual mechanisms by which these meds work, even with testing with blood for compatibility, that doesn't mean we know if they'll actually work as intended. Mood disorders are very treatable, that's what the meds are for. I've heard and read stories about people with bipolar who don't even need meds after a while cuz it becomes that manageable for some. Some form of cognitive reprogramming, one form or another, is what they use to treat pretty much every mental health issue out there, things like cognitive behavioural therapy, cognitive processing therapy, and dialectical behavioural therapy are all ways of reprogramming the brain, but the individual themselves needs to put in a tonne of work in order see rewards. And even after putting in the work, you have to put in more work everyday, it doesn't go away easily."

Bipolar is a mood disorder where manic episodes last at least 1 week in order to get diagnosed and can be medicated cuz it's an issue with a neurochemical balance. Another mood disorder would be something like depression.

Bpd is a personality disorder where their mood swings don't last nearly as long (can be minutes to hours) and there's 8 other possible symptoms that can appear and you need 5 total for a diagnosis.

As for getting divorced so closely after a diagnosis, that sounds really hard and you're allowed to feel however you're feeling, your emotions are valid. It's gunna be tough but you can make it through this.

I'm very much the type of person who is happy to lose those around me who aren't fully supportive of me and my mental illnesses, I don't need that kind of negativity in my life.

I wasn't diagnosed until a few years ago after my friend tried to commit suicide while I simultaneously had a horrible manic episode and knew at that point I had to be bipolar, and had to do something about it.

bipolar,fgj71w4,t3_eyp8pn,1580838208.0,"I was on it for most of last year, I was having HORRIBLE anxiety and I refuse to take benzos cuz try make me really depressed and I'll abuse them. The Zoloft got rid of my anxiety, I was feeling so much better. I only came off of it cuz I was having a bad mixed episode cuz my antipsychotic wasn't working anymore, so my doc switched me off both and I still don't have that anxiety anymore, other than those first few weeks of being next to a bathroom for most of the day, that was the only bad part of it"
bipolar,fgj5x8x,t3_eys2ih,1580837585.0,"It took me a few years to fully accept my diagnosis, mostly cuz it meant I'd be dealing with this for life, but slowly over time you learn to accept it. Bipolar has this funny way of reminding you that you have it when you start to think you don't. As much as I hate this diagnosis, and some days struggle to accept it, I know it's true. You'll get there, just give yourself some time"

bipolar,fghckuq,t3_eyfw5j,1580781823.0,"I was this way when I finally started turning my life around a few years back. I went to therapy, learned lots of skills to help, and found the right meds, I'll be honest, I still struggle, but I don't have my constant swings anymore, I've been mostly stable over the past few years thanks to this. It's very achievable"
bipolar,fg7pcgu,t3_exdghl,1580598109.0,"I totally understand how you feel. I was diagnosed a few years back and hated that I now had this permanent diagnosis that never goes away but it gets better. Having a proper diagnosis, you can get proper treatment. 

Medication isn't the same for everyone, I've been fortunate enough to have only been on 3 mood stabilizers. Side effects are also different for everyone, I'm currently on seroquel and I only deal with poor memory, but I also smoke a lot of weed and have repressed a lot of my life. 

Once I got my diagnosis, I decided to only reject it internally, I went to therapy for designed for mood disorders, and took my meds hoping for some semblance of stability, and through the therapy and meds eventually I found it. I've still had bad mixed and manic episodes over the past few years but I can get them under control much more easily. With proper meds you can be happy, most of the time I'm a fairly happy person living a fairly normal life."
bipolar,fg4wh40,t3_ewuz3y,1580512640.0,"My dad was a programmer in the 80s until the language he used became completely obsolete. He didn't want to have to keep learning new languages cuz it was obvious that was gunna keep happening as time went on, so he became a business analyst. You still get to work with computers but you don't need to worry about knowing a language to code in, and my dad has had multiple jobs where he's making 6 figures a year so it's great money. All you need to do it now, at least in Canada, is take a few courses and you're certified. My dad took one recently to up his resume, they were like once or twice a week at a nearby university at night. Just some food for thought!"
nba,ffz4dvd,t3_evyqv1,1580363580.0,If Knicks fans want a winning team they need to do what Chicago Blackhawks fans did and stop going to games until management starts caring. Chicago won a Stanley Cup a few years after they got new management
