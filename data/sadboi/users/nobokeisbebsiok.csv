BPD,f6g2dpy,t3_dqvb2s,1572820993.0,"Literally almost everyone I know, knows that I plan on killing myself before I reach 30 years old. I simply refuse to be old and miserable. To be still struggling with suicidal ideation and bpd. Some people try to talk me out of it, some people don't believe me. I've got like 6 years to go so I guess we'll all see."
ptsd,f3ah7pl,t3_d6nj9p,1570773125.0,"It's crazy bc when I first got diagnosed with depression and anxiety, I was evaluated by a therapist and she simply said, ""are you sure nothing bad happened to you in the past?"" and I was so confused bc I didn't remember anything but I could some how feel the pain of my past. She sent me home and told me to think about it until our next session so I did. I spent hours, days, just thinking and thinking and then voila! I went to my mother to confirm my memories and she did. After that EVERYTHING came rushing back and next think I know, I'm being diagnosed with PTSD and that was the start in the decline of my mental health."

AMA,ey1lfco,t1_ey1kqzy,1566702890.0,"For an outsider to notice when the BPD is bad, I guess it's the sudden change in emotions (well for me) one moment I'm laughing and being all happy then the next I'm depressed and I don't care about anything to I care about everything too much and I'll get depressed if I think about it for too long (and probably cry lol)

Distraction helps for BPD, but only for so long. So advice for an outsider dealing with someone with BPD would be to let them feel how they feel, offer support, don't let them stay inside their own head for too long, and lots of reassurance that they're important to you and not a nuisance. 

I wish I could help more! ðŸ˜Ÿ"

AMA,ey1j3we,t1_ey1ickb,1566701018.0,"I was 12 when my doctor notice some symptoms I was feeling were anxiety, she recommended to see a therapist. I sought one out and the therapist kept asking me if I was sure nothing bad happened to me when I was younger. I told her I wasn't sure and she sent me home to think about it. After sometime it was like a curtain that had been lifted and all these horrific memories flooded into my mind. One night I went into my mother's room, crying and asking if they were real and she reluctantly confirmed them. Little by little I regained most of my memories that my brain shielded from myself (I guess?) and it was a chaotic downward spiral from there"
