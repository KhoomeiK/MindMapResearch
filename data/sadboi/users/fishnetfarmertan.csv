I am wondering if they could recommend a different vet for a second opinion (or even be able to help you with your family situation). 8 is old for a rabbit who hasn't been fixed and I am worried he might have cancer or another age related issue.

That said, I would NOT recommend a bath. Clean the area (hopefully someone can give better advice on how) but don't submerge any part of your bunny.

I am not a vet, but between his age, symptoms, and the fact it sounds like your family would not be receptive to spending a lot of money on veterinary care, it might be time for hospice.

If that's the case, please help him spend his remaining time in comfort. It's very hard to see a loved one in decline, but we shouldn't shy away from it.

Anyway, I hope someone else here can give you more information. My best advice is to try to find a nearby advocate for rabbits to help you navigate this (but definitely not a bath). I am afraid ""keep an eye on it"" is code for, ""let him die.""

I am so overwhelmed with succulents, I sometimes cry and think of throwing them all out into the back yard to die (and like, same). It would be a big favor to me if you would take them off my hands!!

**FREE cuttings and pups with the cost of 2-3 day shipping:**

Tangled masses of cuttings of:

* Mostly: Graptoveria “Blue Pearl” AKA Pachyveria “Blue Pearl”
* Some: Ghost plant - Graptopetalum paraguayense bernalense (a variety that forms smaller rosettes than normal)
* Fewer: Graptosedum ""Alpenglow""

Cuttings of:

* Lavender Scallops - Kalanchoe fedtschenkoi
* Jelly Bean Plant - Sedum rubrotinctum

Probably some pups of everything above, plus pups of:

* Mystery Echeveria 1 (probably Echeveria pulidonis, but don't quote me)
* Mystery Echeveria 2 (probably Echeveria shaviana, but who can say for sure? plant geneticists, that's who)

&#x200B;

A lot of these succulents lose leaves if you look at them sideways, I will pack as gently as possible, but forgive me if some arrive a little shaken. (The better to propagate.)

If I could afford to, I would pay for the shipping myself, just to clear my conscience of all these plants, but I am what the kids call poor.

Seriously, just let me fill a giant box and send them to you. I don't care if you sell them, turn them into paste, feed them to your pet mealy bugs... just don't tell me about it, I want to believe they are going to good homes.

I will try to post pics in the coming days, but, like I said, overwhelmed. In the mean time, you can search online to see how they look.

Edit: Here is a picture of one planter after it was shorn and one before. (Blue Pearl, Ghost Plant, Alpenglow) I'm sure you can guess which one I prefer. (Yes, the one on the left.) [https://imgur.com/a/r9eApdk](https://imgur.com/a/r9eApdk)

Rabbits,fgewqlc,t3_ey1f0j,1580713009.0,"There are a lot of bunny resources and good info in the sidebar, but it is my understanding that cold is better than heat and that bunnies are happiest between freezing and 75 degrees, as long as they have a cozy hideout. It might be a surprise for him to go from warm to cold abruptly, though. People may disagree with me, but I think, as long as he has a place to snuggle, he will be fine.

As for your bunny's happiness, give up on picking him up. He will probably never enjoy that. Rabbits are prey animals, so being picked up makes them feel like they are about to be food for a predator.

Your bunny might be depressed, but he might also just be growing up and settling down. My bunnies sleep most of the day, so it isn't strange to see them flopped. They are active and zooming around in the mornings and evenings.

I can't say whether you should keep him or not, bunnies are a lot of work and don't give the same kind of feedback as dogs and cats do. If you feel like you really can't give him the life he deserves, maybe see about surrendering him at a reputable rabbit rescue. But if you want to give it a sincere effort, I would still find a rabbit rescue and talk to them about getting your bunny a friend. They are so much happier with bunny companionship. The rescue will be able to recommend a partner for your bunny, based on age, personality, etc. Make sure he is fixed, first. There is information about bonding bunnies in the sidebar, it is a process.

I never really prioritized my bunnies being friendly with me, I just let them be themselves, so I can't give you a lot of advice on that other than, I spend like 95% of my time in close quarters with my bunnies. Much like bonding bunnies with each other, they just got really comfortable having me around and eventually started to seek out my affection... when they are in the mood for it.

I hope this helps! Feel free to ask questions, there are some very knowledgeable people here.

Edit: One of my bunnies hates cats. She hates them to her furry little core. If she so much as catches a glimpse of one, she gets angry and scared. Lots of people have bunnies who are friends with other species, but it's not for everybunny.

Also, a lot of rabbit rescues will just not adopt out to someone who doesn't have permission from their landlord to have rabbits, because it puts the bunnies in a precarious position. I can't make that call for you, but it is something to think about."

I just think it's really important to prioritize them, they depend on me for everything and my misfortune wasn't their fault. I hope this gives you some ideas! 

Buns are most active in the evenings and early mornings, they love doing zoomies and binkies especially during those hours, if you can schedule exercise for then.

In the mean time, consider a small pen attached to the cage, like keep the cage door open all the time and add a little yard for the bunny outside it, maybe even a second story, so the bun can go on top of the cage.

Bunnies can live about 10-12 years, some longer! Will your family still be giving it constant daily attention in 5 years? When one of mine got sick, the vet bills were $2,000 and the bun required round the clock care for a month. Most people aren't prepared for this level of commitment.

Also, a basic requirement is that pots have drainage holes. I like it when they have matching saucers, too.

I actually like a higher fire clay, as long as it isn't glazed all over (a little around the top or outside or elsewhere for decoration is fine). I just think I would want something that will last and terracotta breaks easily. (Terracotta pots in the store are extremely inexpensive as a result.) My succulents are fine even in plastic, so I wouldn't worry too much about medium/high fire clay not being porous enough.

Edit: One drainage hole is fine with me. I also look for pots with unusual shapes/personality. Skulls, faces, animals, drawings scratched in, textures, etc. Really unique things."
Rabbits,ffzelec,t1_ffza8ok,1580375133.0,"I agree with the other poster, get her fixed and then get her a friend (read up on bonding bunnies, because it is a process). Check with a local rescue, the humane society, or the animal shelter. Check Petfinder. Also, get her out of the cage and give her a nice, large pen with plenty of space to run and places to hide. She sounds bored and unhappy. 

But that might still not solve all of your problems. One of my bunnies is scared of her own shadow and sometimes thumps at night; the other is laid back and tries to calm her down. They definitely still chew in the evenings and mornings (they love cardboard and it is very loud), it's just their most active time and chewing is natural for them. It can be annoying, it's true. For me, it helped to split up their meals by feeding them half in the mornings and half in the evenings, about when I go to bed and when I get up.

Besides behavior, bunnies that are not spayed are at a high risk of reproductive cancers. Their lifespan can be cut in half! My buns were already fixed when I adopted them, but people on here talk about putting them in onesies, if they are worried about the stitches. I can't imagine my bunnnies putting up with that, though. One of my buns came down with head tilt and had to wear an ecollar, which I would not recommend unless it was a dire emergency, because it made him have trouble eating his cecotropes.

Anyway, I hope this helps! Bunnies kind of become a lifestyle, so it can be... a lot. If you absolutely have to surrender your bunny, make sure to find a reputable rescue, even if you have to drive a fair distance, because bunnies that are given away often become snake/pet food, or abandoned outside where they will die, and bunnies that go to the shelter are not well cared for, if they survive at all."

Kalanchoe are extremely tough and attractive plants. Mine grows rampantly in any and all conditions (except freezing), and you can prop it by just laying a leaf down on moist soil where it will sprout babies from in between each lobe of the scallop.

I had these growing outdoors in moist, loamy soil, and nothing bad happened, in fact they seemed very happy. The colors are brighter if they are stressed by drought, sun, or cold, but I only ever did that when I was giving one as a gift and wanted it to be picture perfect, normally I try to keep them plump and happy. Anyway, it's a really fun plant and I hope you enjoy it!"
aww,ffc9ko0,t1_ffc4ski,1579794646.0,"Happy cake!! I went down a rabbit hole after I saw this question and after extensive and v cute research (scrolling google images) it looks like they (hares) do often sit in in typical bunchy-bunny-butt style, but also stand up like this and are generally longer limbed and more upright than bunnies. Actually, I just realized my pet bunnies stand like this sometimes, especially when they are being alert and on the move, it's just less weird looking, because they are round little puffs with short little leggies"

succulents,ff9azmg,t3_esc094,1579708855.0,"One of my echeveria is plump like that, so I wouldn't rule it out. If you go to the websites of large nurseries, like mountain crest gardens, you see lots of chubby echeveria. Could still be something else, but you will know more if it gets bigger, flowers, or gets stressed. I agree with the other comment about it possibly being an echeveria prolifica, because they put out babies like wild."

proplifting,ff7gstp,t1_ff7f7r5,1579649206.0,"Also, the one on the top right that looks the most smoosh? I would do nothing at all. I would carefully leave it in its awkward smooshed position and take care of it like nothing happened. It might put out pups along the stem. The leaves might put out pups. The top might reattach, or it might put out roots and do its own thing. It might even spring back. It's definitely not a total loss. Some people might take it apart and prop its constituent parts, if you're a fussy/collector kind of succulent grower, that's one way to go, but I am more of a giant-tangled-bramble-of-unruly-pastel-leaves kind of succulent grower and prefer to let life find a way (and have never been disappointed)."
proplifting,ff7f7r5,t3_es1ne8,1579648164.0,"They look fine to me! You might even get more babies from the leaves that broke off. It's hard to see, but it looks like one might have broken at the stem? If that's the case, let it callous over and it should be able to re-root. Maybe your cat was trying to help by aerating the soil."

succulents,ff2oqdg,t1_ff1s3w3,1579516772.0,"I could absolutely be wrong, I am not an expert, but in my experience, a larger pot and more water (and lots of light) actually worked wonders for my sempervivum. After suffering for a long time in smallish clay pots, I put them in a large plastic bowl planter with moister soil (still cactus soil, just not the most dry) and lots of room. They got huge and started spawning babies like mad. I don't want to say anyone is wrong, conditions are different everywhere, but that was my experience."
succulents,ff2mzlo,t3_er6i4j,1579514073.0,"Not an expert on cacti, but learn from my mistake: We had a drought for months followed by a torrential downpour and one of mine split :( Apparently, this happens when they slim down from lack of water and then rapidly swell faster than their skin can adjust. It wasn't deadly, just unfortunate looking. So do what others are recommending and give it some water somewhat regularly"

TakeaPlantLeaveaPlant,fexjfxx,t1_feuesv5,1579431971.0,"It's really subjective, everyone's taste is different, but I would probably trade my soul.

I would love a skull and/or head (bonus if you can do a feminine face?) I have some really fun things to trade, most are rooted (Hawaiian ti, Sansevieria cylindrica, a ton of different succulents... Seriously too many succulents, Queen's tears, Wandering Jew, English ivy, even Angel Trumpets) and would happily trade any and all of them, just make sure you have space because some grow quite large -- or let me know what your light/space/temperature situation is and I can recommend.

Anyway, do let me know when you're in business. I can never trade here, because I don't need any more plants, but I love art and have been wanting a skull planter and matching head planter, because I think that would make a nice memento mori."
