In that sense, they might be genuine in saying that there's someone for everyone because they might have been in the same hopeless state that many of us are. Afterall, if it worked for them, why can't it work for us?   
Except, sometimes it just doesn't work for us.   
Everyone's experience is different, some people get lucky, others snap out of depression and through sheer effort and will, manage to make themselves more attractive. Sometimes the stars align and the people meet at the right time at the right place. Some people have good friends and made some introductions.   
Whatever the case, others, like myself, just don't have those conditions. So for people like us, it feels like ""love is out there for everyone"" is just a sham, because we've either given up or are close to giving up. Essentially, we've seen no results in ourselves, and all we have are other people's facebook posts or reddit success stories. It's pointless.

None of the people you meet at first may want to spend a romantic night with you, but the more people you meet, the greater are your chances.

Because when I'm venting, I'm not thinking clearly, and I'm really looking for a conversation even though I try to write otherwise. Or maybe I'm a bad writer and it shows that I'm desperate to talk about things."

Hell yeah I want to be average. I'd be miles from where I am right now."
ForeverAlone,f86hhe6,t1_f83qzax,1574298320.0,"I go out of my way to avoid eye contact. If I don't look at them, I won't creep them out."
ForeverAlone,f86hek5,t3_dz2gzy,1574298264.0,"Yeah, like I play League of Legends. Why can't I be a pro gamer, or a streamer. Apparently streamers make hundreds of thousands, millions if you're big. That's easily more than the average citizen. And I wouldn't even have to leave the house."
ForeverAlone,f86h9s9,t1_f8402jy,1574298168.0,"I mean I have trouble talking to people during my job, what makes people think that I'd have less trouble talking to people outside of my job? It's not that I don't like interacting, I'm just really really bad at it and I make things too awkward. With too little experience, I can easily be creepy unintentionally. So I just withdraw and avoid people to keep myself safe."
ForeverAlone,f86h5vx,t3_dz79yn,1574298090.0,"Well I still have first kiss and first time having sex so I guess that's something..... 
Who am I kidding......"

I've been living as if my time is running out, yet I have no physical illnesses and I'm perfectly healthy."
ForeverAlone,f86gmls,t3_dyuwb8,1574297695.0,Would you fight Mike Tyson in a cave while he has night vision goggles if it meant getting a girlfriend? I don't think I'd have the guts to try :/
ForeverAlone,f86ghdk,t3_dz6xex,1574297590.0,"I'm not a bad person, I'm just really really boring. I know and I've seen people who make their girlfriends cry in public, but somehow they still get girlfriends."
ForeverAlone,f7jrg2o,t3_dwc2pg,1573784621.0,"Yeah, I feel bad for people that have to talk to me. But when they can't find something and I'm the only store associate around, well I guess they don't have a choice. I do my best to make the conversation short and straight to the point. Still need practice, but I've been getting better at diminishing the number of words I use while keeping the directions clear. ""Straight, 2 aisle, left, you're welcome"". That's all I need to say."
ForeverAlone,f7jr8h5,t3_dwfaca,1573784475.0,"I wish I could explain my behavior by telling everyone I'm a woman-hating incel. But I hate myself more than anything. I'd be surprised if a woman even wanted to date me. I'm such a boring person that I'd feel bad for anyone stuck with me for more than 10 minutes. I'd love to date and give my all (if I could find a date), but at this point, I have to consider other people's well being too."

ForeverAlone,f5v1ybx,t3_dp3n6g,1572482527.0,"It's not my looks, my boring personality, my awful attitude. It's a combination of everything that makes me unattractive. I've got too many negatives and not enough positives for people to even give me a chance."
ForeverAlone,f5v1me8,t3_dp977j,1572482388.0,"I still dream about my crush in university. We're facebook friends, I'd like to think we were more than just classmates. We even played LoL together at one point and I hard carried (my entire self-worth is based on a video game). She has a boyfriend now, but its not like I had a chance anyways."
ForeverAlone,f5v19u8,t1_f5sr0j8,1572482248.0,Guess I'm just a shitty human being then... There's no other reason.
ForeverAlone,f5v15zm,t3_dp96ge,1572482204.0,Middleschool is where I peaked. Highschool was a period of trying to figure out how to avoid people while trying to look cool. University was just the realization that I'll be alone.

Whenever I see a couple holding hands, half of me gets angry because that'll never be me holding someone else's hand, the other half just feels sad because that'll never be me holding someone else's hand."
ForeverAlone,f5v0bys,t3_dp6xxu,1572481885.0,"Depends. For some people it comes naturally. For others like myself, I guess the lottery is my only chance to even get people to talk to me."
ForeverAlone,f5uzzet,t3_dpbgor,1572481754.0,"At this point, I'll take anyone.   
The girl doesn't have to be normal. She can be weird, we can be weird together.   
I'm so desperate, I'll do almost anything for any signs of affections at this point. I've sunk, and there's no seeing the bottom, but I really don't want to sink any lower."
ForeverAlone,f5uzs06,t3_dp9qaa,1572481674.0,"Honestly, I don't mind not existing. It's the continuous yearning for love and affection that tilts the hell out of me. If I could be invisible, at least take away this feeling of loneliness."

depression,f3hwioo,t3_dh27xv,1570929404.0,Depression is a roller coaster with no way to get off safely. Sometimes it just drops and there's no way of knowing when it'll go back up.
depression,f3hwdyj,t1_f3hielz,1570929355.0,"I always try to spend a good 10 minutes reading some of the ""new"" posts, and try to offer some comments. Some posts are just, I don't know what to say, so I don't want to write anything in fear that I'll make the situation worse."
depression,f3hw5s1,t3_dgz28p,1570929270.0,"I just feel like its hopeless. I just want to be normal, live a normal life, love someone, be loved back, you know, the things that normal people do. I don't want $1million dollars (but I'll take it if someone shoves it to my hands lol), I just want to be normal."
