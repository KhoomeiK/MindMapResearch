I think that to some extent, this is just a normal desire of *everyone* in a long term relationship. There's very little that is quite as exciting as that feeling of infatuation and tension that occurs when a new relationship is forming.

First, I'm so sorry that happened to you. That is utterly *awful*. 

Second, I hate to say this, but you guys were friends for a LONG time, her betrayal was HUGE, and it's only been about six months or so since this happened. I think these (shitty, terrible) dreams are part of how your mind is working out this betrayal and loss. I don't think an occurrence of this magnitude can really go away that quickly.   :(

Have you seen a therapist at all, to talk about this? I feel like a giant hypocrite recommending therapy because I'm on hiatus from it right now as it wasn't actually helping me, but I am planning to go back, as therapy *has* actually helped me with stuff like this in the past. Maybe directly confronting this and talking about it in your waking life will make the process go more quickly, or reduce the dreams? I don't *know* that it will help, of course, but it might."

In certain societies at certain times, of course, there was (like, you'll be socially ostracized if you *don't* have kids) but luckily a lot of humanity has more or less moved past those ideas.
