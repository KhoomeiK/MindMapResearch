Mediums,f0mp4tf,t1_f0mo03q,1568750026.0,"I’m not trying to toot my own horn, because I believe in reincarnation and karma, but I definitely feel like I don’t have bad karma as much as I have good. It’s kind of hard to explain, other than relating to what you commented previously.

I have yet to find out what my purpose is in this world as I am 21 years old, but I definitely feel older than I am, and that my guidance and advice differs to those who I am emotionally connected with."

love,evqanl1,t1_evq9e4k,1564689747.0,"Omg totally blushing just thinking about it lol.

It’s a weird feeling. When I’m in her presence, I want to be better. I want to do better. I want her to live a good life, but I don’t know if she thinks the same. She’s never really open about her emotions about anyone with her friends.

She’s a very shy and timid person when it comes to her love life/attractions towards others—Mainly because that’s a topic we rarely talk about  or discuss really. She doesn’t really know what she wants in that aspect as well."
love,evq8z2u,t1_evq841e,1564688792.0,"That sounds lovely for the both of them! I’m happy for your grandparents! And I really hope my situation is like theirs :)

She’s kind of weird in a way. There’d be times when we’d hangout and I would catch her looking at me then non-chalantly look back at her phone.

It definitely gets me thinking and over analyze her body language."

Again, thank you :). Managed to pull away from my ego a bit to let my pride fall down in order to do something that made me anxious, but would have benefitted me. That’s actually when I saw the number."

You can save a lot off MSRP if that’s the case."

You could also try one of those auto loan agencies online and fill out one of their applications. Soon you’ll be contacted by a dealership and hopefully you will be able to get a vehicle.

I didn’t have a credit score at the time and still managed to get a vehicle loan."

And yes, I will say that saying what you said about killing yourself was a bit too much, but your therapist should have kept calm and tried talking to you instead of instigating the situation by what she said."

I’m going to play that game, but would you rather lose a friend, or still be able to be around her comfortably and still enjoy the moments you have with her? 

Or there’s that other what I’d like...It becomes awkward for both of you everything you two see each other and now it’s like a, “Well shit...” kind of situation."
love,eruzx17,t1_eruzoaf,1561302459.0,"I do realize it’ll never happen, and that’s what makes me sad, and I feel selfish for saying that.

But I get what you’re saying, and I believe I have told him in the past of how I felt towards him, but did get a neutral response. I’m fine with being friends though, as I like and appreciate being around him. He literally turns my world upside-up?..If that makes sense.

I could be having the worst day, but the second I get together with him, everything changes. I do respect his wishes and his perspective and even if he does end up being with a woman, I’ll be happy for him and still support him in the best ways I can. I just want the best for him."

mentalhealth,er3lmbz,t3_c0c6hh,1560466175.0,"Hey man, I don’t know if you’ll see this or not, but there’s a good chance you will.

And there’s a good chance that you will escape this temporary phase of pain, both emotionally and mentally by living another day, and then another, and then another, until it all subsides into what you felt before this all happened.

I have been where you are and it’s fucking shitty. The pain you are feeling right now is what I’m feeling right now, but to a different degree. I just want the pain to stop as well. I’m overly-stressed by what I have created and now I want to end it all, but I can’t. And you can’t either.

Having the pain you are feeling is not fair. Death isn’t fair. Life isn’t fair, but killing yourself isn’t fair either. It’s not fair to those that have known you for a lifetime. It’s not fair for those that are just now beginning to know you, and most certainly not fair for those that you gave a quick “hello. Have a good day” to in the past, and present either.

I’m hard on myself, just as much as you are on yourself. I’m only 21 years old, and I want to physically die. I have a car payment. Rent. Everything else to pay for, but want to know what’s real shitty about all of this? I just lost my sweet kick ass job last night, because I showed up late (three times the charm).

Please. Please. Please go seek help in whichever way you decide, but please do not end your life. We have all been where you are, whether you believe it or not. I love you man, and hope you find what makes you happy again, and may it not be death. ❤️"
Dreams,eqlv5wt,t1_eqlh8v3,1560150600.0,"Thank you very much for your reply! Although this does sound promising, I am a bit hesitant.

I am in a good roommate situation right now paying the same amount of rent. Currently reside in my home state, and have two awesome doggos! It’s pretty great, though it is something I am a bit reluctant to lose.

And the reason why I am reluctant is because I found a job down in the area as well (hiring event kind of deal). Starts pretty soon and is on a weekend, in which on a day I can easily make the 15 hour drive down to, so...Lol.

I’m not worried about money, as I can make enough to sustain everything I need to move down to where I want to, but it’s just the roommates I live with that I am afraid to lose :( I love them and by what I have heard, I am the best roommate they have had..So again, I really don’t want to leave them, but will if I know this opportunity will change my life."
