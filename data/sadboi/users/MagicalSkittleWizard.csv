1) The triggers for each episode are getting less severe. The first time I was set off by years of abuse and stress, and this time it was 10 hours of overheating/stress at a music festival that did me in.
2) The episodes are gradually getting more severe and the symptoms are starting to bleed into my normal healthy time.
