On top of all this the stores shelves are bare because I have customers online and in store clearing them. A$400 order and the store only had $90 worth of product for you? I‚Äôd say you were probably lucky. I‚Äôve seen 300 item orders get 10 items that they actually ordered. Coming into an online forum filled with employees of said chain is not going to help you.

The best way for speeding up subs is to understand the products and what you should be picking for potential subs. Like for ground beef, know exactly what should be a potential sub. For a 3lb, pick 3x 1 lb ideally. 

Little tricks you can pick up along the way. Just come in on time and work hard."

relationship_advice,fm89sza,t3_ftmjk6,1585845465.0,One of the most important things in mental health is to have a good support system. A SO that hides medication and lies about it would not be a good support system. Honestly pranking your partner is immature and really unheard of. She needs to start acting her age or start packing.
