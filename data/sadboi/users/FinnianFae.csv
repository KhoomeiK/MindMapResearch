I think Roger , John and Brian dealt with it in very different ways.

Roger was always referencing his past with Freddie, mostly the flea market days when they ran the booth. He collects little Freddie toys. He posts old polaroids to Instagram. 

Brian always mentions how much he wishes Freddie was still around, usually in his Instagram posts. He also sets up a lot of the memorials around and does public appearances. He seems to be the one that does the most post Original 4 Queen. 

John completely shut everyone out. He took it the hardest and just couldn‚Äôt be around anymore. To be honest he wanted out long before he got out, but once Freddie died it was more of a final nail in the coffin.

She stays in motels and hotels (and even an abandoned house that one time) so she can do sex work until she gets kicked out or runs outta money.
