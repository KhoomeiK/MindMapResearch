dogs,fqyccu9,t3_glkwxv,1589746298.0,"My girl would get anxious when the clippers would come out, and I felt super guilty about the few times I cut a little too deep. I bought the Dremel dog nail grinder and I've been really happy with how it's worked out. I lay a blanket down on the couch and hold her paw so my body is blocking her view of the Dremel. She pulls occasionally but I can usually manage to fully trim a single paw's nails in a few minutes. Once you get good at it you can put it on the higher speed setting and zip right through it. She's usually very happy and playful when the ordeal is over, it's like night and day versus the hour of hiding in her crate and judging me like it used to be after clipping her nails. You can also round off the nails so they don't cut themselves when having a scratch. The only downside is that it's a little messy, but if you did it outside or with a blanket that you plan to wash who cares."
BPD,fq50hm1,t3_ggtj8q,1589088839.0,"I understand the reservations about trying it due to the risks involved, but if you have a sober friend stay with you and take a small dose, ideally a microdose that you will barely notice to start, you very well may have a positive and enriching experience or at least learn how it affects your body and mind at a safe level where the stakes for having a negative experience are very low. Just remember that no matter how odd you may start to feel, it's a journey that can better you and make you feel more connected and empathetic if you don't fight it, stay positive, and keep your cool.  You can lean into it and really use the experience as a transformative thing that may give you some fresh perspectives on life, your own identity and the way you live your life. If you do it, make sure you do it somewhere that you feel completely safe as the setting has a big impact on the experience."

BPD,fi2iklz,t3_f63nuq,1582080597.0,"You need to accept that your feelings of anxiety can be worked through when they arise, no matter how difficult. Maybe tell your friend that you're having a really hard time and you appreciate her, but you need a few days of alone time to recharge.  It can be scary riding the emotional wave over and over, but deep down you know you don't want to push her away.  I don't know about the details of your friendship, but you didn't mention that she did anything intentionally to hurt you.  The best way to keep a positive relationship with your friend is to be open and honest about things that may be stressing you out and communicate in a healthy way.  Friendship is a necessary part of a happy life, and that IS entirely attainable. You can do it.  Contemplating suicide and suicidal ideation is normal for us, but it doesn't make it an acceptable or valid choice.  We're here for you if you need to talk ♥️"

There will always be the ones who use their knowledge of obscure bands to one up others, it's just a small dick attitude and perpetual reality, but they're the minority. Most of the old guard and enthusiasts would prefer to share that obscure stuff with someone who may not be up on it and talk about how cool it is or share some war stories. The scene isn't going to die as long as the fans and bands keep adapting and that doesn't seem to be in danger. Part of that is openness to new ideas while understanding the roots that got it there.

metalguitar,fdkjh8y,t3_elvs6r,1578504989.0,"It's a good idea to let the tubes warm up a bit before you let er rip, so you should flip the standby switch for a minute or so before you go loud. Also unless you have some electrical aptitude I wouldn't mess with biasing tubes. Preamp tubes can typically be swapped without worry but you should bring it to an amp tech for power amp tube replacement.  The stored energy that is present even in an amp that's been powered down can be lethal for quite a long time unless it's had a way to safely discharge, so keep that in mind as well.

Edit:
More things, make sure you don't use a regular instrument cable to connect the amp to your speaker cabinet. You'll need a speaker cable which is the same mono plug but with a much heavier gage cable. Also when hooking it up, make sure you match the impedance of the speaker with the correct output on the amp, just match the number in ohms on the label of your amp's output with whatever is shown on your cab, failing to do this properly can result in a destroyed or badly damaged amp."

It's harder to treat yourself with compassion when you feel like you don't deserve it, but it's the right answer. Make sure you don't react angrily right now.  You don't hate your boyfriend and you may feel like you hate yourself, but what I'm hearing from you is that you really just hate feeling the way you do right now, which means you hate BPD. If you want to crush something mercilessly, focus that energy on the annihilation of your BPD, and realize that it won't be this way forever if you're willing to put up the effort, no matter how tiring.

I'm not judging, I've been there believe me.  He seems like a good person from everything you said, and like you said this lady doesn't even realize that this is hurting you.  She just wants to see her old friend while she's in town.  It's a very understandable and totally normal situation and it'll all be ok. Sleep will make you feel better.  Another way to look at it is that since you value your bf's opinion, and he liked her enough to be friends for so long, she might actually just be really cool! Shoot, you two could end up being friends if you gave her a chance. It's never a good idea to develop strong opinions about someone you don't know very well, and maybe one day you two could look back at this and laugh.  Recovery doesn't happen overnight, and I understand that you're in a situation where your stress level is really high and you're feeling vulnerable. It sucks, but it'll pass.

BPD,faxsx3e,t3_eav2vi,1576389221.0,"If he's hanging out with a group including other friends, it may not be what you think right now. I know this is very upsetting and you feel really awful, but just keep in mind that he may not be up to anything at all and her being there isn't a big deal to him/he's just socializing. I obviously don't know the details, but a good approach may be to sleep this one off, think about it in the morning, and if it really bothers you still sit him down again and tell him that you're really uncomfortable with the situation because of the history they have.  A very important point to make is that he needs to have the space to socialize, and if she's a part of his friend group it may not be easy for him to not see her from time to time while hanging with other friends and doing normal friend stuff.  I don't want to minimize your feelings in any way, but I also would encourage you to make sure if/when you do have a conversation with him about it that you are understanding about the boundaries he needs to maintain his friendships and your relationship together. If he's being sketchy or only hanging with her that's a different story and he's probably not someone you want to spend energy on. I hope everything ends up being ok."
