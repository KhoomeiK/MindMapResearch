I've been a huge fan of the series since I played 3 on the PSP and 4 on the PS2. Haven't really had the chance to play 5, and now that P5 Royal is out and we are in lock-down, this is the perfect time.

As for my drawing, I couldn't possibly draw a Persona character in 10 minutes, so I did my favorite superhero, Spider-Man.
