Having taken two friends to CAMH emergency before, my one major piece of advice is do NOT downplay your symptoms. They are operating at maximum capacity, so if they assess you and you don‚Äôt express that you are seriously suicidal, they may put you on a waiting list for group or individual counselling and send you home. Which is fine for some, but if you‚Äôre in immediate danger and want an in-patient stay, seriously, be very honest with them or you may be turned away. 

If you or anyone reading this wants a second-hand account of what to expect: 

You arrive at the emergency (college Spadina), talk to a nurse, and are placed in a waiting room. 

You‚Äôre then called into a secondary sealed waiting room, you can bring a friend. There‚Äôs a smaller room within this room, eventually you‚Äôll be called in there and speak to a counsellor for assessment. You can‚Äôt bring your friend into the assessment. 

Based on that assessment, you will either be sent away with an outpatient plan, or admitted. If admitted, you are then placed in another room with other patients while they arrange a room. At this point, you must stay (I think it‚Äôs 24 hours) overnight and can‚Äôt leave. It can be a little scary, sometimes, as some of the other patients might be having psychotic episodes or problems that can be tough to watch and hear, but you‚Äôre safe. 

Then you‚Äôll be moved to a proper room and begin your stay. At that point, you can have visitors. The stay looks like group and individual counselling, activities. Stay usually lasts about a week. 

I hope this helps! TLDR, if you go, don‚Äôt downplay."

enoughpetersonspam,fq1kjxd,t3_ggh9nh,1589046476.0,"Looks like you‚Äôve already got some great answers in here, but here‚Äôs my ELI5 TLDR, in case it helps!

In Canada, the Human Rights Act ensures equal opportunity to individuals who may be victims of discriminatory practices. For example, if I am gay, and I am fired by an employer *because* I am gay, the Act ensures that I can seek legal justice. (This is extremely simplified, as each province has its own anti-discrimination legislation, and cases like me being fired would probably be pursued provincially before federally... but stay with me!)

Before, the Act covered a variety of marginalized demographics‚Äîsexuality, race, religion, disability, etc.‚Äîbut it did *not* cover trans people. That means if one was trans, and one was fired by an employer *because* they were trans, they would not be protected under the Act.

Simply put, Bill C-16 was an amendment to add trans people to the list of marginalized demographics covered by the Act. Harmless enough, right? Making sure trans people are protected in cases of discrimination-based injustice. 

But Peterson‚Äîof course, all of the eye roll emojis‚Äîtook it, veered wildly off track, and made it about *him*, and free speech. He spun Bill C-16 into a boogeyman, and stated that under this amendment to the Act, anyone who did not respect trans peoples‚Äô pronouns would be criminally or legally punished. (This is not true.) Peterson is a gender essentialist, meaning he thinks there are innate, fixed qualities to men and women; that trans people‚Äôs gender is therefore invalid; that accepting their gender is therefore an affront to science and reason; and that being ‚Äúforced‚Äù to respect or use their pronouns is therefore an affront to free speech. 

The ruckus Peterson stirred up about this got a LOT of his supporters and followers riled up. But in the end, suggesting that Bill C-16 was somehow putting those who don‚Äôt use trans peoples‚Äô pronouns at criminal/legal risk was 1) one helluva slippery slope fallacy, 2) blatantly untrue, and 3) thinly veiled homophobia. 

To come back to my gay analogy at the beginning: if I‚Äôm fired for ‚Äúbeing a dyke‚Äù, the Act has my back. But if a colleague accidentally assumes I‚Äôm straight, or asks if I have a boyfriend, or any other misunderstanding, of COURSE they‚Äôre fine, I‚Äôm fine, everyone is fine, and the Act need not apply. D‚Äôuh. In Bill C-16, Peterson was making it out to seem that anyone who misgendered anyone was federally in danger, which is ludicrous. We just wanted protection for trans people. 

TLDR, Peterson turned C-16 from a pretty harmless amendment of who is covered by the Human Rights Act into a transphobic boogeyman."

Like, to the point where it was almost comical and distracting/dangerous to do so.

ontario,fpowcxu,t3_gejv3a,1588791791.0,"Hi! I can relate to this. It's okay to feel nervous!

It took me three tries to get my G2. (This was the mid-2000s, and our driving test centre in St. Catharines was *notorious* for failing people multiple times, it was infamously known as a cash cow. More tests, more money.) Anyway, when I failed the first time, for the stupidest smallest reason, it really deflated my confidence. When I failed a second time, I went in pretty nervous, and made some (not terrible but failable) small mistakes. I was gutted and felt like a failure. Third time was a charm. 

Getting my G was smooth sailing, though: passed on the first try. 

Here's my unsolicited advice, if it helps!

- Get lots of practice, now. The more you drive, the more it feels like second nature. 
- Identify the areas you're weaker on, and focus on those. For me, it was a smooth parallel park. In the days leading up to my G, I practiced over and over again. (Can share some parallel parking tips, if you like!)
- Review all the little things, like which way your wheels should be pointing when you park on a hill. 
- On the day of the test, overperform caution. Story time: I wore my sunglasses for my G, and asked the instructor if that was okay. She said sure, but that I'd have to move my head when spot-checking, as she couldn't see my eyes. I pulled a Larry David and WAY overperformed the head turning: my head was whipping around like the girl from the Exorcist. At the end of the test, the instructor said I passed, barely, because I should have been turning my head and checking blindspots *more*. Lol. 
- Don't forget the parking brake, at beginning and end. 
- On the day of the test, do everything you can to be in a calm state. Skip the coffee if it makes you jittery. Have a nice meal. Listen to calming music. Repeat that you've got this! 

And last... if you're feeling too nervous to take the test, fuck it. Skip the test and don't beat yourself up. I'd recommend that you do go through with it, if you can -- especially since you just got your first car, and it'd be nice to enjoy it and not revert to a G1 -- but if you don't, it's not the end of the world. We're all dealing with a ton of shit right now, and you don't need added stress. You can always take the G2 and G again in future. 

Good luck!"

toronto,fo6swbz,t1_fo6f37a,1587566100.0,"Not a hard source - because so little data exists - but I've been hanging out in r/COVID19positive, and there are tons and tons of people (tested and confirmed positive) who are experiencing ""second waves"" of the disease. Like, sick for 3 weeks, then better, then sick again at four or five weeks. The number of people asking ""who else is on week eight"" is terrifying."

Side note, in addition to OP and the Roncesvalles parrot, I saw *another* post in here recently about a found parrot a Redditor was trying to coax into a cage/locate the owner. What's with all the missing birbs lately?"

I‚Äôm Canadian and have been keeping my eye on this: https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/coronaviruscurve/

It‚Äôs interactive, every time I check out the US line to see, I‚Äôm horrified. It‚Äôs just awful."

canada,fnmqxla,t1_fnmqk7e,1587076462.0,"I relate to this so much. Some days it's healthy-ish, wine to take the edge off... other days it's like, shit, had mug wine at 1pm on a Zoom call to chill my nerves, suddenly it's 7pm and I've drank a litre and I'm wasted, and it's not time for bed yet. And the hangovers...

I'm cutting back and rationing too. It's hard not to drink with all this stress, but I'm reminding myself that overdoing it exacerbates the stress. 

Sending strength!"
