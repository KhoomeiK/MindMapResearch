AskAnAmerican,f8alybe,t1_f89tr0t,1574401559.0,"Of course Trump supports deserve to be treated like people. But we aren’t going to get very far together until we agree on what is true and what is false. Trump, and his supporters, have been pushing fiction as fact for the past few years. How are we supposed to have a conversation about what’s going on and what to do about it?

Frankly, no one is expecting the Trump cultists to come around to reality on this one. Only some people in the middle have to come around."

It was months ago, and I’m still not over it. the weirdest part of it was when I woke up randomly (I could only sleep in short bursts) and couldn’t remember who I was. I’d never experienced anything like that before or since. It freaked me out."

Everyone reacts differently to these things, though."

Klonipin is something you’d take because you’re having a panic attack, or forever reason need to calm down now. It’s fast acting. It can make you a little loopy. It’s not something you’d want to take every day.

Remeron is a really good antidepressant. For the most part, it’s not a fast-acting medication, but it does have some fast-acting effects. In other words, you’ll need to take it for several weeks before it builds up in your blood, and then you’ll feel its full effects. I found it to be a very effective antidepressant and helpful for anxiety. It absolutely cured my feelings of low energy and interest in the world around me, but it did nothing for lack of motivation. If anything, it made this worse for me, because I didn’t care that I wasn’t doing what I needed to. 

The #1 side effect for remeron is craving food, and I found it made food taste so much better. I became a better cook when taking it, because I craved things that are delicious but fattening. Unusually, this happened from the very first dose, soon after taking it. 

It also can make you sleepy, but that’s sort of a helpful side effect. My doctor proposed it as both an antidepressant and a sleep aid, since it’s best to take as few drugs as possible. It didn’t make me particularly sleepy, but most people report that it does. 

I found it made my muscles twitch a little bit every once and a while, but that’s not a common report among people who take it. 

I still would recommend it to a friend.

Hope this helps! I didn’t proofread at all so sorry for any mistakes I missed"

Consider finding ways to reduce frizz in your hair. That will go a long way towards making it more manageable, and making you feel prettier. Look for a shampoo that says it’ll do that. If your hair doesn’t respond to that, you could try heat or other stuff. 

But, really, you aren’t ugly."
