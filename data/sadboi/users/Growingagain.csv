I vaguely remembered it when I woke up and attempted to write it down. I nearly lost it, then I focussed and was able to remember the story arc at least:
The bad guys are chasing me at my parents' old house (not sure who, I just know this big dude qants to harm me). My mom is pulling me to safety over and over, all over the house. They keep almpst catching me, then I slam the door in their face just in time as my mom pulls me away. Awesome :)

For context, mom struggled with mental health all her /my life... she recently (like 5 yrs ago) did a lot of healing and found treatment that works for her. I have been in a bit of a low spot myself the past 3 months mentally. She has been an immense source of support to me during this time. So the dream makes total sense if you look at it like that."

That dopamine thing the weed does (or whatever drug/ numbing behaviour you use), can also be seen as ""resolving"" psychological tension and recreating old scenarios in your life. I like the idea that we can sit in the tension, neutralise the thoughts and feelings (they are not real), and use the tension creatively.

It is like the bow and arrow quote:

""Remember an arrow can only be shot by pulling it backwards; so when you feel like life is dragging you down with difficulties, it simply means that it's going to launch you to something great. So just focus and keep aiming""
 - Unknown

The real secret is USE YOUR CREATIVE TENSION MEANINGFULLY INSTEAD OF RESOLVING IT MEANINGLESSLY!
