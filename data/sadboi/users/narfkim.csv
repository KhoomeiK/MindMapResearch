recreationaltherapy,esduq0j,t3_bzn975,1561869369.0,I am a CTRS in BC and jobs seem to be more readily available. Though there seems to be a greater presence which is fantastic as our continual advocation for Therapeutic Recreation is working! I would highly recommend pursuing education with a rec. therapy basis over an “activity” one :) Just my 2 cents! Good luck!
