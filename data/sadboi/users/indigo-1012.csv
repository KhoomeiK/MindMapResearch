BPD,fnar7id,t1_fnamv05,1586802394.0,"Hopefully having borderline traits will be a happy medium? Like you'll get access to the medical support you need but without the horrible consequences (insurance etc). It is a tough one because it is so subjective, which is why the face to face appointment with a psychiatrist is so important. I too have intrusive thoughts but OCD has never been mentioned to me.

Responding to your point about traits, a lot of mental health conditions have elements that overlap. Intrusive thoughts come under a few diagnosable conditions, and as mental health is such a spectrum, it is impossible to diagnose yourself. Also ""traits"" imply that you'll have a few of the symptoms to be diagnosed with traits of X, but not the minimum to be officially diagnosed with X. If that makes sense?

DBT is such an effective therapy and there are loads of resources online you can use (a lot are free) so you can do some independently and the future in laws never need to know :) 

Sorry you have to use your outside time for your therapy, that sounds really tough"
BPD,fnailnj,t3_g0lso9,1586798142.0,"Hey :) fellow UK based sufferer here

Yes, you absolutely need a face to face appt with a psychiatrist to be diagnosed. Unless they've got video appointments sussed, you'll probably have to wait until after lockdown to get a proper diagnosis (sorry) :(

Your GP may be able to prescribe some antidepressants or anti anxiety meds to get you through the lockdown, talk to him/her to see if there is anything they can do to help you.

What I can say is you dont need the diagnosis to start getting better. There is stuff you can do in the meantime, especially in this lockdown. Get books to help manage your symptoms. I recommend The Dialectical Behaviour Therapy Skills Workbook which takes you through a lot of what you cover in the ECS skills program (Emotional Coping Skills), which is the main thing you get put into after being diagnosed. 

For what it is worth, getting diagnosed helps with getting you the professional support you may need. But actually having the diagnosis is shit. I've been refused life insurance because of it and my other insurances are so much higher since being diagnosed. The stigma around EUPD is awful... even among medical professionals.

I hope that is sort of helpful? Let me know if you have any questions"

BPD,fcazueg,t3_egqjf4,1577579880.0,"Yes. I tell anyone that may need to know or someone I think needs educating (managers at work/HR/friends/anyone that is willing to listen). What I've found works best is describing how it effects YOU and what THEY can do to help. Plus relating it to something they understand usually helps. I'm the queen of analogies so they're sprinkled throughout my rough script below...

Me: I've been diagnosed with something called Borderline Personality Disorder, or BPD (EUPD in the UK). It's a pretty nasty sounding diagnosis and everyone experiences it differently, but for me it is like I'm an emotional burns victim and therefore I struggle regulating/managing my emotions. You know how if you get good news such as (insert example here) you feel good? That same good news will make me feel so on top of the world I feel unstoppable. And if you get bad news (example) you feel a bit crap? That same bad news will likely send me into a downward spiral that makes me think about ending my life/hurt myself/(example). It is exhausting.

(Uneducated Them): so it is like bipolar?

Me: (it isnt but you have to humour them) sort of. I guess they're similar in that both BPD and Bipolar generally have highs and lows but for someone with Bipolar each ""high"" or ""low"" lasts for a long time, like a few days, weeks, months or even years. BPD is different in that I can cycle between many extreme emotions within minutes. Bipolar and BPD are **very** different illnesses and only a psychiatrist can diagnose people. Both conditions are super complex and really quite different, I think BPD is a personality disorder but bipolar is a mood disorder so in that way they're in totally different chapters of the psychiatrist's handbook.

Them: so are you just too sensitive?

Me: almost certainly, but it isnt helpful when I get told I'm ""too sensitive"". I said earlier im like an emotional burns victim. If someone has 3rd degree burns over their body and someone taps them on the shoulder it would be excruciating for them, right? Something that others may see as relatively minor or insignificant can really effect me. If I think the tone of an email is slightly off I may believe that I'm about to get fired or I've upset that person in some way. 

Them: that's crazy(/some other unhelpful comment)

Me: This is something I've had as long as I can remember but now I'm able to put a label on it and get the appropriate treatment. Like if someone is diagnosed with eczema/asthma/cancer/diabetes they get a special cream/an inhaler/chemotherapy/insulin (or other example which they may be able to relate to). This is something I'm working on - like physiotherapy for my brain. It is really hard and there will almost certainly be cases where it is two steps forward and one step back, but I'm trying. I'd appreciate (some kindness/patience/insert what you want) whilst I'm essentially rewiring my brain. What would mean the world to me is (if you think I'm having a tough day, just check in on me/something relevant to you). 

---

I have so many more examples I could share, including depression/anxiety/taking meds. I'm hoping that by talking about it now it may make someone else's life a little easier in the future. People are scared of what they dont know so playing a part in their education will hopefully reduce the stigma attached to mental health. Dont pretend to be a healthcare professional if you aren't... just stick to your experiences and how it effects you.

Just a health warning - not everyone is willing to listen/learn. Start small with people you trust then once you gain practice then consider expanding the people you confide in. Good luck <3"
BPD,f6k4ym5,t3_drl0ua,1572905006.0,"This is one of the first things we cover in DBT. Imagine a venn diagram - one circle is ""emotion mind"" and the other circle is ""rational mind"". The intersection is ""wise mind"" and is where healthy decision making and healthy living is. Google ""wise mind"" for more info but your two mind thing is suuuper common in our community. 

Full disclosure... I'm about half way through my course and I still dont feel I have that intersection. For me it is either cold rationality or hot emotion. I'm still trying though so hopefully... maybe one day... we will be able to manage our emotions in a healthy way. Good luck to you all x"

You wont ""put the idea in their head"". That just isn't a thing. One of two things will happen if you ask this question:
1. They look at you weird and say ""no""
Or
2. They go silent/no eye contact/say yes

Be direct and neutral. If option 2, listen to them and encourage them to seek *professional* help immediately. 

To answer OP
- sudden and unexplained improvement in mood
- change of language 
- ""getting things in order"" eg sorting out wills etc
- collecting resources to complete suicide"
BPD,f388fe8,t3_dg2ew1,1570734359.0,"Yep. Starved myself or threw up as a way to cope with the intense emotions for 15ish years. Sadly it is an easy default when my bpd flares up. 

I just try my best to be mindful when I have an episode (so so so hard). Make sure i drink enough water, eat sensible regular meals and make binge foods hard to get to to avoid binging.

It is a constant struggle ngl. Just dont give up if you slip up"
