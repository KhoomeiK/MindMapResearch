I also have an ileostomy, permanent 

my journey started at 24 when i was diagnosed with crohn‚Äôs.  i just had my first baby. 
Every time i ate i had horrible cramps and would end up in ER  The ER dr told me it was my nerves due to having a new baby., i knew better.
   After three rounds of ER one radiologist saw extreme swelling. my GP did some tests and sent me to a GI  dr
I was put on meds and did well until i was 28.

At 28 i started with the crohn‚Äôs pain.  My GI dr sent me to a surgeon i have my meeting agree to surgery.  when surgery time came after the prep kept coming up i was rushed to hospital.
i woke up with a port in my neck, a jujiostomy connected off my belly and TPN, was like this for 6 months.

I was starting college with 2 kids and a failed marriage. i felt like no one will want me with 2 kids never mind an ostomy so i gave up on men and decided it would be just me and my babies.

I was introduced to a guy a year earlier and we ran into each other through the friends who introduced us.  We dated , he loved my kids (2 & 6  at the time) we were engaged for 5 years. He accepted my ostomy.

I ended up in the hospital for 3 weeks my ostomy was failing me nutrition wise and a tpn can hold you for so long.  my weight was 107 
once i was stabilized and had a heart test i was allowed to have reversal surgery.  my fianc√©e was a saint he would bring my babies in to see me, bring me college homework (this class was itv broadcasted to tons of sites) the nurses would put tv on for me. he even snuck in my kitty to see me, she was a my baby too.

I was reconnected and home glad to be alive.  i was put on prednisone for a while then other stuff that didn‚Äôt work so my GI and i decided to try humira 
all had been well for years.
Until the pain started again I was diagnosed with colitis and IBS after tons of tests and dr visits.  the enemas are brutal.  So i just struggled with the meds and symptoms i graduated in accounting was able to work.  My fianc√©e and i were married in 2001.

In 2012 a blockage makes an appearance at 42 years old.  after all the years of this ordeal i was rushed to surgery and again woke up to an ostomy an ileostomy to be exact.  i‚Äôve had it 3 years and it‚Äôs permanent.  my large intestines work in some areas and not others.  i‚Äôm okay with my ileostomy as long as i have no crohn‚Äôs pain those are killers.
I won‚Äôt lie i was so sad afraid my hubby wouldn‚Äôt be attracted to me or that it would change things between us.  But he was so happy i was alive.
i adjusted well to changing the appliance. My feelings were hurt by me putting so much pressure on myself to still be superwoman.

I was like great i can go back to work soon.  Then more pain started more dr tests etc was diagnosed by a specialist with fibromyalgia and spinal stenosis. Now after all my work to graduate i‚Äôm on disability......

sorry it‚Äôs so long i‚Äôve never told my story."
