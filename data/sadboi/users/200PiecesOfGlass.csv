By refusing to tell him, you’re reinforcing your worries as well as providing him with reason to worry.  The healthy thing to do would be to tell him what happened if/when he asks for details, and explain as calmly as possible so that he can comfort you.  If he’s upset or uncomfortable, make sure to stress that you’re ok (if you are), and let him know what he can do that would be beneficial for you."
Psychosis,fmm6sk5,t3_fw4k4z,1586199834.0,"There are a few disorders you’re probably familiar with that can develop the suffix “with psychotic features.”  Someone with MDD could develop psychotic features and thus be diagnosed with “MDD with psychotic features.”  It is important to stress that this is not TRUE psychosis, and can be as simple as hearing the voice of a deceased loved one.  These “psychotic features” are dependent on the prefix of the diagnosis, in our example MDD, meaning that if the person is treated for their depression, the “psychosis” will dissipate.

As far as my own psychosis, I can’t remember a time where I wasn’t hearing voices.  I haven’t thought much about what caused it to happen, because I don’t think it ever really started.  However, there are a few specific delusions and hallucinations I suffer from which clearly originate from events in my life (Seeing wounds appear on people, believing I’m going to be a serial killer, etc.)."

You’ll play the role of Anxiety, and they will respond however they feel appropriate.  You start by asking a classic anxious fear, such as “You’ll fail your next test.” It then becomes a debate where you try to get them to believe that they will, and they try to fight it.  If you’re unrelenting and adept enough, you’ll succeed and then you both break character and then you deliver some witty one-liner like, “It’s that, with everything, all the time.”  It’s a powerful and first-hand experience that in my experience conveys deeper understanding than any book."

Seeing as you don’t normally go out let alone for three hours, it’s not hard to imagine stress building up over time and eventually sending you over your limit.  If you’re worried, take it slower if you can.  Try going out with friends or family for say, an hour a week (or whatever you’re comfortable with).  If the group wants to stay longer, don’t be embarrassed to go back home if you want to.

If you’re still worried about it, turn the water up to about what you would use and have someone else feel it with their hand.  If they’re recoiling in pain, then you should probably try slowly pining yourself off that kinda heat.  I’ve found myself in a sorta similar situation to the point where the veins in my limbs were irritated for hours afterward.  Anyway what I did was start really cold and slowly get hotter until I could tolerate it (kinda lukewarm) and use that.  If you find yourself stuck at the same temperature force yourself to take one just barely colder than you would like and repeat until you’re happy."
