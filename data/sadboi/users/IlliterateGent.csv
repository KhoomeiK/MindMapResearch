Coping by crying myself to sleep is just so much easier. I doubt my identity all the time, teetering between accepting that I may be bi and trans or denying that I’m queer at all and I’m just faking it for pity points. I’m an adult and should’ve taken care of all my problems by now, but I just keep fucking up. I need help but keep pushing help away from me out of fear. Ah fuck."

ainbow,fhdhro3,t1_fhd25v0,1581486740.0,"Christians ought to be judged by their actions, but we ought to be, too. Bearing false witness is bad, telling the truth is good, no matter your religious affiliations. Christians can be great or terrible people, just like every other group of human beings in the history of Earth.

“They” are not a hive mind. You should not blame all Christians for the actions of some. That’s what I’m saying here. Rip the vile, bigoted, homophobic assholes of this world to shreds, whether they’re Christian or not, but don’t even dare touch someone who hasn’t done any wrong (or perhaps you believe that all Christians are evil for belonging in the cult in the first place?).

Not all Christians take the Bible literally. At least, not the good ones. Some Christians have an agnostic philosophy (i.e. I have no evidence of my claims, but I choose to believe in it), and don’t believe in the magic of miracles or that God wrote the Bible. Some believe that the Bible was written by flawed men perpetuating a patriarchy.

No, the fundamentals of Christianity are not love and respect, **because they are not a hive mind.** Some denominations claim they perpetuate love and respect, but really, even denominations aren’t hive minds. It all depends on the local community for whether or not they give out love to everyone without discrimination. However, if a denomination has a high leader (i.e. pope or something) that preaches disrespect, then you can bet most local communities part of a denomination will follow his teachings and be disrespectful. But even then, some people will still be respectful even as their friends and family disrespect others.

Holy shit have you never been outside of the Bible Belt or Catholic countries? Not all Christian leaders are evil. Many are, in fact I would claim that most Christian leaders are terrible and hypocritical people, but so long as there is even _one_ Christian that leads their community on a good path, your blanket statement is false.

You have an **Us Versus Them** mindset against Christians. This is not healthy for you, any Christians you interact with, or the environment you live in. Christians are not our enemy. Some of the people that have hurt us most just happen to be Christian or use their political power or religious “teachings” to excuse their bigotry."
ainbow,fhcu2vh,t1_fhcb9fo,1581470861.0,"I don’t think the blanket statements are helping anyone. “All/most Christians are bad” can condition people to judge someone based on their religion, just like how homophobes judge us based on our sexual and gender identities. Homophobes use blanket statements against us to fetishize and dehumanize us, why must we use the same hateful tactic against their religion? I know some Christians of varying denominations and sects that truly believe their religion’s teachings and treat their neighbors, even LGBT+ neighbors, with love and respect. Of course, I also know many Christians of varying denominations that are hateful, bigoted pieces of trash. However, I’ve recently realized that it’s not just because of Christianity as a whole, but rather because of aspects within certain communities that use their religion as an excuse for their harmful behaviors. If the fundamental teachings of Christendom were hateful and bigoted, then how the hell can loving, respectful Christians exist?"
