addiction,foe7gi1,t3_g6q3vu,1587697567.0,"I’ll definitely check that out man. I was addicted to it for about six months and saw where it was headed well before I finally quit. 3,500 dollars in debt later I’m still working out of it. Currently down to 1,400-1,500 hundred. Sports gambling hasn’t been my primary addiction. Opiates, benzos and weed are my three headed dragon. What I noticed about sports betting that was distinctly different from the other addictions is the whole chance of winning making it easier to mask and appear to be not as destructive. Never again. I’ll check out the blog man and congrats on setting yourself free!"

Hopefully everything turns out ok. His energy will be with you everyday through this. I would try to vent anyways you can. Tell Reddit, other loves ones, friends. This way you can process your emotions without panicking your husband. I know due to the worry everything seems dark but just maybe the genetic test will come back and it will be very treatable. Hope is always on your side and will make a better friend than worry. Good luck ❤️"

depression,fgpkq20,t1_fgnyc67,1581006749.0,Same I found one at a car wash that works with me really well. It adds some structure like you said. It also takes away the perfectionist anxiety to an extent to. Because it forces me to process the shame and guilt instead of doing it “the perfect way”
depression,fgpk1f2,t1_fgmwvou,1581006360.0,"I found one at a full service car wash. I’ve had crying breakdowns, walked around anxiously and it’s obvious I’m depressed and generally miserable. The hardest part is surviving the shame feelings that come with the perception people are judging you for it. But, if you can find a connection to yourself that’s strong enough to get you through it, it’s definitely worth it in my opinion. Less aimless feeling, less perfectionism because you have to allow yourself to make the mistakes to get through it. I’ve had to communicate with my bosses about it and we’re all on the same page. They will work with you if you can find a way to process some of the shame by getting outside of it. It’s an everyday challenge and not an easy task but, it certainly beats being stuck in a catch 22 cycle. Did it for 3 years. No job, job hopped. I just wasn’t mature enough to deal with it. It’s hard I feel you. But, somewhere in you it’s possible for sure"

SuicideWatch,fdx4zc3,t3_en84y4,1578765413.0,I feel you on the internal rage. The truth is none of those groups of people are interesting. You notice the things they don’t want to know and if you bring it up expect them to pretend not to get defensive. Objectivity and creativity isn’t of interest to people. Only telling themselves some sort of story because they feel their thoughts are the “most” rational. I put my hate for existence into academia at this point. It’s really the only place where I can go into some philosophy and not feel people think I’m being a judgmental asshole. It’s all the same corny bullshit from 99% of people no doubt. I can’t ever talk to people because they externalize everything. People think that are “environment” shapes who we are and blah blah blah don’t get me started as well.
