Metallica,fnnxtaq,t3_g2sptl,1587105119.0,Agreed. It‚Äôs the first Metallica album I bought. I remember when it came out at my local K-Mart I would just look at the cover. Finally I decided to buy it. I had listened to typical ‚Äúhard rock‚Äù up until then but when ‚ÄúBlackened‚Äù started a whole new world opened up. I could no believe what I was hearing. I rewound that song at least three times before I went to ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù. The album definitely changed my life.

There are however many cats that need a family, too. We lost two cats last year. One we had for 18 years and one for 4 years. It was devastating when they passed and I said ‚Äúno more cats‚Äù. Then a stray started coming around. She was real friendly but we didn‚Äôt want another inside cat. This happened around last December. We live in Indiana out in the country. The winter started setting in. We didn‚Äôt see her for about 6 weeks. I was constantly worried about her and felt guilty about her being outside. She came back around in February so we took her to the vet and had her checked out. She‚Äôs been inside since. A few weeks ago another cat was coming around. She was also very friendly. Took her to the vet to make sure she wasn‚Äôt chipped and got her shots. She‚Äôs a part of our family now.
 I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that although it hurts to lose a companion there are many that need love. I‚Äôd like to think our two ladies that passed away would be happy with us adopting a couple of their cousins."
