Pluralsight has lots of videos you can watch which honestly makes learning code a lot easier. But it's not an essential to have, I just find it handy to have. 

Coding is really satisfying to do and I enjoy it a lot. It can hurt your brain sometimes though but that's also part if the fun.

Student accommodation landlords are just there to soak up your loan. I paid, in York, 320 quid a month for everything in a shared room in a proffesional house. My house mate was a French student so it is possible to find places who have a mixture of student and professional. Just keep the place tidy n you're fine. My GF at the time was paying 200 quid more than me for a room which was damp n constantly cold only because it was deemed ""student accomodation""
