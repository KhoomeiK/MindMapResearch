In real life though it's not gonna fly. Work is absolutely out of question, opening up there is a 100% sure way to lose the job.

Opening up in relationships always backfires. People would despise, envy, blame, hate and push away. And it always sours the relationship. 

Same with friends, although there is a single exception here. I know a guy and he is aware of my issues. Always tries his best to cheer me up and I love him to bits that he is so understanding. But it tears my heart apart, being like that in front of him. It's all over his face and I can tell he is feeling powerless during some moments. And I wish I wasn't a wreck at least in front of him, since he is the least deserving of that.


How do I deal with that? I just try to suppress it. Not talking to anyone during these moments, not leaving my apartment for a week or two. Inflicting physical pain on myself used to work when I was younger, it used to help me to switch to the immediate pain, but nowadays it doesn't work.

I think, what gets really stuck in the memory isn't ass or tits, but the way they breathe, the sounds they make, facial expressions during the process or orgasm. Even the jokes we've made while at it. 
Besides, I've had a complaint once. When that girl broke up with me she literally said ""I'm always angry because you don't fuck me often enough. That stuck in the memory too.
