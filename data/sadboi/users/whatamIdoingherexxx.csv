Conform and wear that heavy mask or watch friday nights pass alone in your home with a gut-wrenching soul crushing loneliness. My solution has been to find a balance of both. Play by societys rules but put my real self and personality in everything I do. So what I come off a little whacky at times, so what I offended that person on accident. I dont do it on purpose, but I have to let this lion out of the cage just a little bit for my own sanity and well being. I also notice that personality disorders (specifically the suffering) take place in the eye of the beholder. Our brain has a tactical advantage over us, it knows our weaknesses, insecurities and flaws and will remind us every chance we get. The outside world is not so privy to this, so if you can change your inner dialogue and find a place in your mind where youre comfortable with small talk and caring about things about other people when you truly dont, you give yourself a much better chance at a better life. I find my life works best when I do the exact opposite of what I feel like doing, thats my roadmap, and majority of the times it turns out great. Saying hi to this person, vocalizing and asking my boss for something, meeting up with that person - I dont wanna do any of that shit, and thats exactly why I do it, and thats how I beat the crippling loneliness and heaviness and emptiness of ASPD. one encounter and one thought-reversal at a time."

The most important piece here is your awareness, you are insightful as to what you are doing and your intentions, which is key. As someone who does the same thing, its a gift and a curse. You‚Äôre not oblivious to your internal pain (if you have any) and the damage you cause others (although you may not care much), but on the other hand you need this insight to create masks for society and that same insight helps you break off any masks and false personas and start operating from your true self - a measley decayed tree stump barely sticking out of the ground. With awareness your goal is to become a full blown tall and healthy tree - the pain for me personally was pretending I was a tall tree when I was just a stump and I knew it. I use this analogy (the tree/healthy human) because a tree is not afraid to be itself, it stands tall and upright and doesn‚Äôt feel shame, it stands tall proudly, it just is. That‚Äôs how we have to be as humans. 

I am no professional but I‚Äôve spent majority of my life and time reading and immersing myself in the intricacies of human behavior, mental illness, diagnosis, PD‚Äôs etc. Though most personality disorders are comorbid with a goodie bag of other diagnosis - i‚Äôm gonna go ahead and say you fit the criteria for someone who falls under ASPD.

sociopath,fkumvsx,t1_fkugoya,1584552363.0,"My psychedelic days are over and I‚Äôve experienced all you described on my journey, many times over. I am interested in the unaltered mind, just me and my mind. Appreciate you."
sociopath,fkuengp,t1_fkuav6w,1584547988.0,I guess i was looking for an alternative to pretending as this is what i am good at and exhausteddd of doing. But looks like my only option
LowSelfEsteem,fktwv43,t1_fktwatr,1584536862.0,Fuck. It really sucks.
aspd,fktnpyv,t3_fkl55p,1584528090.0,"Still trying to figure this out myself. I‚Äôve asked tons of related questions, many of which I get the response of, ‚Äúwho cares, why do you need to feel anyway? Just ‚Äòfake it‚Äô‚Äù, and I am in no way satisfied with this answer. I have been studying the coping mechanism of Intellectualizing - pretty much using your brain and complex concepts to absorb any type of blow your emotional processing would otherwise handle. The opposite of Intellectualizing is feeling, lately I keep trying to flip my thoughts and intricate mental packaging of any event and try to invert it into feelings. I wait and I wait and I make note of what i‚Äôm feeling - I get very very little. Maybe with practice I can start making a dent below the neck. Best of luck."
sociopath,fktmtzl,t1_fktf2g1,1584526999.0,Doesnt that get frustrating? I am the same way and for some reason am not okay with it fully.
socialantisocials,fktc2jx,t3_fh6e07,1584513395.0,"So what makes us different than a nuerotypical? Dont they have to make these same deliberate thoughts and plans? Why does it seem like we are conducting a secret operation, what makes the experience different for us? Is it less real for us? What do ASPD‚Äôs really truly genuinely want? Were conforming to regular people, but what do we want?"
aspd,fktbnb7,t1_fktbdzs,1584512915.0,Cool thanks
sociopath,fktaj6a,t1_fktaeji,1584511692.0,"This has been my stance for years now and I see it‚Äôs not working. I‚Äôm not willing to stay stuck in my room anymore, I am facing the discomfort. Thank you for your response"
LowSelfEsteem,fktadyp,t1_fkt5lxj,1584511538.0,"Exactly. How tf do we fix that? I dont want to envy my partner, I want to embrace them."
