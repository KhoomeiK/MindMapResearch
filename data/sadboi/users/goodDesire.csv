It will lead to feelings of dissatisfaction of our current situation. I am feeling stuck too. 21, took up education degree but decided not to pursue a job in the education sector. Now, i am having a hard time looking for a job which makes me feel more depressed. I am only consoling myself through cigs and drinking. In between those moments of watching the time to pass, I know deep in my heart I am thankful I am alive."
