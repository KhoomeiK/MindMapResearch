BipolarReddit,fqyn8vo,t3_glidsz,1589751344.0,"I find the opposite.  While on one hand i have major anxiety leaving my house to get groceries, gas, whatever it may be, going to work feels like a break.  While im not working right now due to current issues, it leaves me bored out of my mind and i am left to my  intrusive thoughts all day long.  When i go to work i have a task and i do it well. I dont think about all the other debilitating bipolar thoughts.  Just my job. Yes, I dont enjoy social interactions very much, but the patients i have to talk to daily arent like family or friends.  I dont feel judged for anything. Patient convos are simple...how are you, ask questions pertaining to why they are there, etc. Im not in fight or flight mode. I dont have a good answer for you but i hope you find some help for yourself. Disability is NOT and easy way out. You are not lazy! Just because it isnt a physical disability doesnt make it less real or valid"

BipolarReddit,fqurtn8,t3_gkty1t,1589663616.0,I hear you. Its a tough position. My psychiatrist was referred to my by my physician and covered by OHIP ( in Canada).  Hes been good though although this isnt my first one.  Im looking for counselling and its all out of pocket as i dont have insurance.  I know i need a counsellor but am a single mom of three so i dont know if its possible
BipolarReddit,fqudz9o,t3_gkty1t,1589657148.0,Get a new psychiatrist. You NEED a second opinion!
BipolarReddit,fqtmymm,t3_gkb1aq,1589642116.0,"I have been feeling the same way.  Im pretty sure im in a mixed episode.  Dark and depressed for a few days, have a good day or two, then back down. Have talked with psych and they upped my meds. Havent made a difference. Psych said its ""situational"" and things will get better. I get that, but i also know how im feeling and feel the dont understand or take me seriously.  I sleep alright. I have to keep to a schedule. Even if i get 8 hrs vs 5, im tired and lethargic. Literally all day my eyes are heavy.  I cant take naps so thats out of the question.  Just feel kinda lost with no help or support"

BipolarReddit,fq1ha34,t3_ggi81k,1589045642.0,Thank you so much for your comment.  I know my family loves me in their own way.  They stick their head in the sand when it comes to my illness.  They can be cold.  When i have to see them i am anxious for days leading up to and a while after too.  Even video chats right now with them cause major anxiety because of off hand bull shit comments.  I have my boyfriend for support but thats about it.  I told him yesterday that i need to seek counselling so i have an outlet and some outside help to help me deal
