I too, find peace in the fact that I can opt out of life's trials and tribulations. I find it ironic that people are panicking and scrambling to hoard various goods because of this invisible enemy. I've had to deal with chronic pain on an almost daily basis for the past two years, where I've had mysterious joint pains which troubled me to no end. Even though the pains have lessened, it is still rather comforting to plan for end-of-life matters: writing a will, do-not-resuscitate order, no funeral etc., and procuring the means to end my life. Against thoughts of languishing in a nursing home someday, or in a hospital incapacitated and hooked to machines, suicide seems like a merciful escape. Thinking of suicide is the only way I cope with difficulty now. 

And OP, I will not tell you life gets better when I am not a clairvoyant."
SuicideWatch,flznw7b,t3_fryzsj,1585628427.0,"Absolutely not. If it gets to the point where I'm critically ill, I have the means to take my own life. 

P.S. To the articles everywhere telling you how to boost your immune system to fight coronavirus <-- laughs in autoimmune disease (lupus)."
SuicideWatch,flzmuh0,t1_flzjlh4,1585627632.0,"Exactly. I don't know why people see therapy as a cure-all. Plus all the armchair therapists saying things like 'it'll pass' or 'it's all in your head'. I've seen how dismissive some therapists can be, and I'm certain they'll shove the fact that you'll live with chronic pain, for the rest of your life, under a rug.

Furthermore where I live there's a strong stigma against mental illness. Being diagnosed with one will put a black mark on your reputation. Then you can forget about finding your place in society."
SuicideWatch,fktknwx,t1_fkti2wd,1584524222.0,"Sure I'll try. Thanks for your concern OP, means a lot to meüòÄ"
SuicideWatch,fktafq7,t3_fkjj7f,1584511592.0,"Same here but with prescription meds.

As someone with a chronic illness and an uncertain future, suicide seems to me like a feasible exit through the back door."
SuicideWatch,fkss9to,t3_fkduyc,1584497212.0,"Great. Just reading your therapist's response was convincing enough for me NOT to get any kind of psychiatric help. Especially when you live in a place where everyone just expects you to 'grin and bear it'. Plus a strong stigma against mental illness. Pretty sure any therapist here would dismiss you with an 'it's all in your head' response, and shove the fact that you'll live with chronic pain for the rest of your life under a rug. I've already decided that seeking help would be a complete waste of time. Now it's only a matter of how and when I'll do it. Then I'll let my corpse do the explaining."
SuicideWatch,fkqllmj,t3_dbnkhc,1584449629.0,"Yes I do. Every. Fucking. Day.

I was diagnosed with lupus half a year ago (had been suffering joint pains/swelling/stiffness for two years before that left me mentally drained). And I've only recently turned 26. I've been on Plaquenil and prednisone since but there are occasional flare ups, and those are when I feel the worst. It also sucks when you're brought up in a place where everyone expects you to just 'grin and bear it'. Plus a strong stigma against mental illness. So somewhere I stopped caring and doing the things I used to love. My pre-illness life just seems like a completely alien dimension to me. I remember fantasizing about anime/videogames/fantasy etc., now it's all realistic and depressing e.g. stabbing myself in the chest. I've heard of how people can die (in agony) from lupus-related complications, so there is no way I'm putting up with this FOR THE NEXT 50 YEARS. From where I live legalization of euthanasia/PAS is absolutely OUT OF THE QUESTION. Furthermore travelling to Switzerland and getting the legal procedures done is far too tedious and expensive for me. So if it ever comes down to it I'll have to take it into my own hands. It's just a matter of how and when. 

Sorry for the long wall of text. Just needed to vent."
lupus,fkqbl3z,t3_e7myrd,1584439163.0,"I have lupus too and it flares from time to time (I'm not off Prednisone yet, been almost a year). During these flares I feel the worst. HATE the swollen, painful knees. If I try to tell others how I feel they'd trivialize it and tell me to go 'suck it up' (typical Asian 'grin and bear' mentality ha!). Somewhere I stopped caring and doing the things I used to love. Now my pre-illness life seems to me like a completely alien dimension. I've stopped talking to my friends and family because I think they won't understand anyway (my superstitious dad tells me to pray too). I feel you and I won't say 'it's all in your mind'. I've been told that many times and it does nothing to help at all. If I feel fatigued I'd just drop everything and take a nap (for this I'm glad I haven't found a job yet). I'm here to vent too."
SuicideWatch,fkq95zi,t1_fkh5oh9,1584435989.0,"I know this all too much... used to daydream about anime, videogames, fantasy etc. After my illness (lupus) my fantasies have gotten pretty realistic and depressing e.g. how and when I'd get it done. Somewhere I just stopped caring and doing the things I used to love. 

I'm been holding on for the past 2 years because i don't want to hurt those around me but lately I'm starting to think that is not enough for me to keep living."
