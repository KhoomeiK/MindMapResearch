antidepressants,fqro1xi,t1_fqrnocz,1589588282.0,Yeah I feel ugly too but trying to diet and not eat in my sleep.  Lol. That's what sucks about antidepressants is that you gain weight.  Some are different than others though.  I'd ask to try something else or even look into Neurostar. NAD though.
antidepressants,fqrnhz3,t3_gki3e2,1589587950.0,I've been on it and raised the dose to 40 mg. I gained 20lbs. Been on it for almost 3 months.  But its helped my anxiety and panic disorder.  My sister is on 120 mg and she never gained weight.  So I don't know. She's been on it for years.  I notice that its making me sleep walk and eat.

antidepressants,fpd35d7,t1_fpd2u48,1588518846.0,I'm taking an SNRI... maybe try something else like a mood stabilizer? There are so many meds that can help.  Hopefully there is something that can help you. Sorry that happened.

Also SSRIs tend to make you feel worse before you get better it can take weeks. If they didn't help you should look into TMS.

Medication has helped. It was a fucking question to see if this person was taking anything because some ppl like myself thought medication was poison. Yes medication can fucking help with symptoms.
