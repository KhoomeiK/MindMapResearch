ibs,f49sq1o,t3_djxv4e,1571482683.0,"I got to the point on my cheat days that I no longer enjoyed those types of foods because of the pain and discomfort it would put me through, so I decided to just stop trying and learned to cook real food. It's work but is definitely worth it. You have to ask yourself is it time to change your lifestyle or continue doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome."

Anxiety,f2yhjz2,t3_dek2lo,1570491580.0,Hang in there. It's not easy and takes a long time but consistency is key. Hopefully you'll get a therapist who will give you the tools to overcome this. I've made progress myself so I know it's possible. Good for you and keep on keeping on
Anxiety,f0cwcp3,t3_d4e064,1568546179.0,"If at all possible and if you haven't done so, see a doctor to rule out any conditions. For example thyroid issues can cause anxiety. Then see about a Cognitive Behavioral Therapist if also possible. I found this helpful personally. It didn't solve my anxiety but certainly helped me to think differently. Also remove anything in your diet involving high amounts of sugar at one time. I stopped drinking sodas and eating ice cream and noticed improvements. There are other steps you can also take. I wish you well and sorry your going through this"
IBSHelp,f0cpb03,t3_d4c7fy,1568543417.0,"I use to go through all that, spending hours on one sitting while still having to come back shortly for more. Now, In addition to giving myself at least a few hours before I leave for work, I instead limit myself to 15 minutes to each bathroom visit and go at least a few times with exceptions. To help facilitate a bowel movement I drink hot tea in the morning. Also to help with discomfort I try to distract myself and help feel more comfortable and RELAXED by doing complicated math problems or work on some killer greater than sudoku puzzles. It passes more easily. I still can't take buses or trains ever so I ride to work on my bicycle instead"
Entrepreneur,ezzckiv,t3_d33cn5,1568284624.0,Check out Rossmann Repair on YouTube. He repairs macs and he creates video content while doing so. Watch as he starts with a few employees and expands to a dozen. He is looking for a larger space now to help him expand the business further. And he talks about many issues. I think it's a great place to start to get real world information.
