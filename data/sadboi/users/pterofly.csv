Everyone has a different transition experience and wants / does different things.

Getting a service dog is a huge responsibility, a huge amount of work and effects every aspect of what you do. It's definitely not a decision to be made quickly, without considering every other option first.

Im so glad that you had a gift you were truly able to enjoy, even if you couldn't share your joy with others. Funny how it's the little things that somehow mean the most sometimes."

It works really well for my super greedy guide dog (Labrador). It's a really nice size too.


I second the frozen Kong and Kong wobbler suggestions too. Soaked kibble, then mashed and stuffed into a Kong and put in the freezer for a few hours is essentially like a doggy popsicle 25g / a large-ish handful (weighed dry) lasts my lad 45-50 minutes. (Sorry, UK only know metric haha)"
