From [this textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Nutrition-Metabolism-Sareen-Gropper/dp/1305627857/ref=dp_ob_image_bk): Epidemiological studies provide evidence that increased intakes of fruits and vegetables are associated with a decreased risk of some cancers. Studies examining vitamin C status (as opposed to dietary vitamin C intake) and cancer risk also generally report favorable associations. The associations between vitamin C and a protective effect against cancer is generally stronger with cancers of the oral cavity (including the pharynx), esophagus, stomach, lung, breast, colon, and rectum. However, reports from studies providing oral vitamin C to prevent or treat cancer are inconsistent with most showing no overall benefits. Some antitumor effects have been documented, however, with the use of high doses of intravenously administered vitamin C (which generates plasma vitamin C concentrations over 100 times that attained from oral ingestion) as an adjunct to other cancer treatments. Additionally, vitamin C (dietary or in gastric juice) as well as vitamin E in the somtach may react with nitrites (ingested in foods) to deter their conversion to nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic."

However, the more vitamin C we take, the less we absorb. A person deficient in vitamin C Who eats less than optimal intakes can absorb more than 90% of what they consume.

Wellthatsucks,fg30ske,t1_fg2mwnb,1580464941.0,"Alright so here's the two stories I have heard from my instructors that left a lasting impact on me:

1. The lead occupational safety and sanitarian at my university spoke to my undergraduate food management class about a symposium she went to about food safety and sanitation. A dietitian spoke about her experience visiting a gluten-free restaurant with her fiance. In addition to her Celiac disease, her fiance had a shellfish allergy (which isn't uncommon considering its one of the top 6 food allergies). Given that the restaurant was invented to be conscious of the different allergies, dietary preferences, and sensitivities that people may have, this seemed like and exciting restaurant to try. After ordering, the dietitian's fiance discovered that the restaurant put shrimp on his dish despite asking for no shellfish. He refused the dish nicely and asked for them to remake the meal. When the fiance began eating the remade dish, he felt himself going into anaphylactic shock. The restaurant employees didn't remake the dish and chose to pick out all the shrimp instead (which is a major, major no no). The couple didn't have an EpiPen on hand, and the dietitian's fiance died in the restaurant. That story really, really sticks with me and shows that even small lazy moves in the kitchen can have a negative impact on somebody else's life. 

2. My county's epidemiologist came to lecture one of my classes about her role in our community and share some more interesting stores. My graduate school is in a town that people commonly visit to train for sports due to the high altitude. There was a football team at a camp, and all of the players were high school age. A recent storm flooded some of the woody areas, and the well water at the camp became contaminated with a number of cultures that shouldn't have gotten into the well. The team ended up getting Norovirus which causes extreme nausea and diarrhea. The epidemiologist was interviewing one of the boys when he literally passed out due to severe dehydration all while his football coach insisted they were all fine. Multiple athletes and coaches were hospitalized which attracted some media attention. When they were trying to disinfect the rooms that the boys were in, the samples they took to confirm everything was 100% sanitized actually turned up completely covered in Norovirus. It turns out the cleaning crew didn't use the proper method to clean things and ended up wiping the virus around with the cleaning materials rather than killing off the virus. Clorox ended up sending several boxes of wipes to help disinfect all the rooms completely. I know this isn't quite food sanitation, but Norovirus is extremely dangerous in a food setting. Its one of the primary foodborne illnesses that prompt the recommendation to STAY HOME if you are vomiting or having diarrhea because it is spread fecal-oral route (yes, ew). It inspires me to ensure employees practice safe handwashing and cleaning practices in food service.

Those are the two that stick out the most to me. It probably seemed ""extra"" to think that leaving meat out was gross, but I think a lot more about this kind of stuff than others might."

HaircareScience,ffyubbv,t3_evrn3i,1580355327.0,"Loading up on vitamins and supplements will not help your hair unless you have an actual deficiency. J recommend d speaking about this with your doctor and getting a blood test that also ensures you have enough folate, B12, and vitamin D. Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin, so most supplements will end up being peed out once you obtain enough through regular diet."
BeautyGuruChatter,ffy9xqo,t1_ffwnfxv,1580341456.0,"I meant to write supplements, not gummies. They are more difficult to predict absorption and verify potency. It truly depends on what you're taking and why you might prefer a gummy form. USP verification is the gold standard for any supplement, tablet or gummy form."

BeautyGuruChatter,ffvxz4n,t1_ffv6zbk,1580276757.0,"Are you serious? This is so, so incredibly misleading. Did she ever post studies about her product? I can get a USP certified version of each ingredient in her overpriced supplements for less than half the cost of one bottle of her gummies. And at least I'll know they contain what they claim to! The supplement industry is drastically unregulated and dangerous, and I think it is shitty and irresponsible for her to sell supplements at all. Stick to USP certified gummies for things you are actually deficient in - taking excess water-soluble vitamins will at the very best come out in your urine (literally pissing away money) and at worst impact your body in negative ways (e.g. kidney stones) because we do not store most water-soluble vitamins for more than 3 days. Fat-soluble vitamins are potentially more at risk for dangerous overconsumption that can lead to toxicity (e.g. hypervitaminosis A, prostate cancer for vitamin E, etc). I dont trust that the people taking the supplements understand that more is NEVER better in regards to prescriptions. 

TLDR; Halo bad, Tati shouldn't sell, please consult dietitians and doctors before supplementing."

I only qualify for nutrition and medical assistance because I have a disability. There have been nights where I question whether life is worth it when I have to struggle so hard to feel unfulfilled, depressed, and unappreciated."
