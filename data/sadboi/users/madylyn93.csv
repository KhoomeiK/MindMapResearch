goldenretrievers,fkr07a4,t1_fkqzszr,1584459257.0,Thank you! He's the best boi :)
goldenretrievers,fkqv6f0,t1_fkqkbyl,1584456244.0,"Thank you :) He most definitely is spoiled, as he should be!"
goldenretrievers,fkquyta,t1_fkqu4x7,1584456115.0,"Congrats!! Be sure to post pupdates on here, I'm sure we'd all love to see him/her. :) Very excited for you - Murphy's literally been the light of our lives since we got him."
goldenretrievers,fkqup6b,t1_fkqscu5,1584455947.0,"I actually don't find that to be the case at all. The only thing is probably the puppy breath, but there's no escaping that. I'm pretty sure it's a common, if not all encompassing thing that all dogs go through. Just make sure to give him baths frequently if you're worried!"
goldenretrievers,fkqjjjc,t1_fkqiz2y,1584447917.0,"Thank you. :) It was a pretty long wait because we wanted to be financially ready for him, so good on you for not rushing it. Your good boi will come when the time is right. <3"
goldenretrievers,fkqhvym,t1_fkq800n,1584446391.0,"My husband and I are newly married, and he's essentially our first child, lol. We couldn't be happier, though he's definitely a little stinker, literally (he just rolled around in mud after a bath). But man, he's so worth it."
goldenretrievers,fkqhb7h,t1_fkq81sb,1584445826.0,"Of course, glad his cute little face could brighten up your day in these trying times."
goldenretrievers,fkqh7ok,t1_fkpyq7x,1584445727.0,"Honestly, better than I could have ever hoped. We're going on about a week and he's catching on really quickly. Mind you, we live in a townhouse with no yard and we're currently bell training him..so he's caught on a little too well and figured out that everytime he rings the bell, we take him outside, lol."
goldenretrievers,fkpo0nd,t1_fkpnfz8,1584414764.0,"Thank you! He's our first puppy/golden, and he's definitely getting spoiled rotten!"
goldenretrievers,fkpnt5q,t3_fjwylz,1584414614.0,"I am so sorry for your loss and can only imagine the pain you're going through. Rest in peace, Kirby. Heaven is definitely a sweeter place with you in it."
goldenretrievers,fkplsdb,t1_fkplkux,1584413210.0,I HAVE JUST MET YOU AND I LOVE YOU.

It's funny, I had the exact same experience on my birthday - down to the same exact thoughts as you. I can't really say it gets better as I'm in the pit of a year long depression myself, but I do understand mental illness. It's incredibly lonely and painful. And it's all the more painful knowing that it's all your own doing. My heart goes out to you, and I hope  you feel differently soon."
