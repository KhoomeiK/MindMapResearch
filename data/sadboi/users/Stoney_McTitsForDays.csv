One thing I would hope that stylists (or any provider) would do would be to address the ‚Äúchit chat/light convo‚Äù. I know this sounds absolutely crazy but when I do ever return to the salon, I truly dread the thought of trying to wear a mask and chit chat. Maybe a preemptive ‚Äúhey, I know we‚Äôre wearing masks and it‚Äôs totally weird so I‚Äôm not going to chat your ear off because it‚Äôs hard to talk in these things. Just let me know if you have any questions or need anything during your service‚Äù! Also may deter those chatty clients! Everyone‚Äôs going to want to talk and that stresses me out. 

Also, my hair salon is opening up Friday and they called today because I had a cancelled appointment. I told them that I would go ahead and make an appointment mid-June and play it by ear. I suggested the consult I need to have be over face time and they were going to see if it was feasible. May also be another cool thing to do for stylists.

NOTHING has changed with this virus. The only good thing that has happened is that the majority of people did a really good job staying home and flattening the curve. *IF* the numbers don‚Äôt spiral out of control when things re-open, it will only be because of the people who see this as insane and stay home anyway. So basically, everyone who is screaming about re-opening will go fuck around and get sick but the ones who stay home will keep those numbers relatively in check. Just a theory. 

Also newsflash to all of the assholes thinking it‚Äôs one way or another: my pay has been cut, my roots are outrageous, and I too would like for things to get back to normal. But I also would not like for people to get sick and die for it. Thank you."

‚ÄúRe-opening is genocide disguised as incompetence.‚Äù"
CoronavirusAZ,fpie8p2,t1_fpiaehh,1588639103.0,I feel you on this. It‚Äôs so hard to fight the urge to speak up - especially when tons of people will attack you.
CoronavirusAZ,fpi8kym,t1_fpeu7kd,1588635827.0,"So my company just cut my salary for the next 4 months by a significant amount. I‚Äôve never have used UI but with the PUA set to open next week, it says to apply even if you don‚Äôt qualify, and then they will review denied claims when PUA starts.

So I tried to do the application and it doesn‚Äôt give underemployment as an option...basically just if you got fired or furloughed. I don‚Äôt want to put inaccurate information but I can‚Äôt find any information on DES‚Äô website regarding underemployment. Since you mentioned it, I figured I would ask-any ideas on what to do in this case?"
