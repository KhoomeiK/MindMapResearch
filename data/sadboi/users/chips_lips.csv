Whilst perhaps not super interesting, it suggests that an absolute shit ton of feet would have to trod over that step for however many years to make that kind of depression. Bluestone is tough!

The step is inside the gates off Lydiard St South, at the threshold of one of opposing doors that are locked about 10-15 metres beyond the initial gate"

I have no idea what it’s like to live with epilepsy or the magnitude of your heart ache.

SuicideWatch,euhu8hi,t3_cgigy7,1563834269.0,"The end of school doesn’t have to be so considered and thought through.  

I know you’ve said your family wouldn’t allow a break, but what if you got yourself a temporary job (labouring in a trade you might be interested in) and saved your butt off and went travelling?   Besides physically restraining you (hoping that’s not an option), there’s not a lot they could do, right?  

There’s nothing like travelling to broaden people’s horizons, come out of your shell, grow in confidence and provide some perspective (and who knows, direction?) in life.  I’ve travelled with people who were meek and introverted at the beginning of journeys to watch them become confident assertive people in a matter of months.  Muso’s do quite well travelling, making connections with others and entertaining hostels full of people.

I saw in previous posts you were worried about lack of maths knowledge stopping you from operating in a fabricating trade.  School isn’t for everyone.  I was personally terrible at maths and school in general.  I was given an opportunity to learn in a work environment and flourished.   I’m now a data analyst.  There’s a relationship between motivation and learning.   

Don’t think so finitely.  This is literally just the beginning of endless opportunities.   Good luck buddy."

My $0.02: there’s obviously bad areas, but they’re not as distinct as Melbourne.  You can get good houses in bad areas, and vice versa.  Boundaries for good and bad are not as defined as other towns/cities.

We bought the worst house on a good street and no regrets.  Definitely glad we didn’t buy in a new estate.  Whilst new and flashy now, I personally think most new areas will be ghetto’esque in a few years.
 
Look for big blocks in established areas.  

Look for connnections to schools, transport and amenities.

Ps this assumes you’re looking to buy, not invest.
