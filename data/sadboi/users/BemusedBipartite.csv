bipolar,fg5znt0,t3_dwreql,1580546081.0,"Celexa killed me. Medication-induced SUPER MANIA. Finally corrected the diagnosis, but not before I made a fool of myself in public and ended up in jail. I didn't hurt anyone, I was just excitable, loud, and really annoying. My psych got a promotion within a week of my arrest and moved to another state. I lost custody of my children.

Facebook memories continue to remind me what I was doing that horrific day throughout the years. Seems like I've been manic at the end of every Winter since 2006. It was so clear; I was upset for not seeing the signs myself."
bipolar,fg5yvwc,t3_eve9ds,1580545006.0,"I enjoy arguing aloud by myself to every single person and thing I'm upset with when I'm in this state.

Currently, my opinion is really strong (loud) right now and it's best I argue with the wall. I straight up TOLD that wall what I thought for about an hour. I passionately wrapped up arguments and felt justified and proud afterwards. 

I played ""Destructor"" and completely remodeled my bedroom (tearing out floors, busting up walls) and rebuilt it beautifully, but my body PAID for that for a LONG TIME. ðŸ˜‚ Be careful with yourself!"
