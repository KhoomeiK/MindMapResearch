ptsd,f8nqj78,t3_e109x5,1574650391.0,"Please stop right this second, gather a few of your things in a bag or backpack, and leave. Walk away. Go to a safe place where you feel that they will not look if they look in the next hour or two, and sit to breathe. If it is daytime (so there are people there) and you feel like you could find one that they wouldn‚Äôt look for you immediately at, go to a church. If it is nighttime, and they wouldn‚Äôt look there immediately, find a fire department. Explain your situation. Both churches and fire departments have networks of people that want to help others.

Your feelings are normal. Our bodies and brains are wired for ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù. The most sure way to ‚Äúlose control‚Äù is to be put into a situation where you cannot leave, and then be forced to feel emotions that you do not feel capable of escaping. In this case you WILL lose control. The only way for our systems to reset is to get to a place where we feel safe from them.

Once you are there, explain that you cannot safely go home. Explain that while you may not be currently being physically abused, you are afraid for your life (either your life will be taken, or you will take a life). They can then ensure that you find a safe environment to be able to speak to the police about your situation.

If you live in a small town and are afraid that the police may not listen properly, and they will contact your ‚Äúfamily‚Äù then tell the firefighters or church that you need to talk to the county or state police and not the town/city police.

If you feel that you cannot financially afford the cost to physically leave (an Uber, Taxi, etc.) then get your things packed into a bag and walk a mile or two away to a place with other people and call 911. A 24 hour Walmart, McDonald‚Äôs, gas station, etc. find a quiet place to call from. If you feel comfortable enough, go to an employee and say ‚ÄúI am in need of a safe space to call and wait for the police to arrive; I am a victim of abuse‚Äù. They should help you find an office or place to do what you need. 

But most of all, try to remember that YOU are stronger than this. YOU are not the dog in this situation, he is. Please be safe and do not allow yourself to feel stuck."
ptsd,f8g3e9k,t3_e0hi2c,1574553520.0,"I can confirm that doing ‚Äúone thing‚Äù is helpful. Don‚Äôt focus on everything that needs to get done. Put on some comfort sounds (movie, music, etc) and just focus on ONE thing. Not ‚Äúdo the dishes‚Äù. Do one dish. Then step back and let yourself process that you were successful. Focus on the music/movie. Distract yourself. It‚Äôs not easy, it doesn‚Äôt make things easy, but it‚Äôs a step. Some days I get one dish done. Some days I get one dish done and then find that I‚Äôve gotten them all done"
Shitty_Car_Mods,f7zchde,t1_f7zbg9k,1574108669.0,"For further explanation, look at the term ‚Äúredneck engineering‚Äù. Oftentimes things would/will break on the farm. With those types of issues, it is oftentimes not possible to make a run to a store for replacement parts. Farms and ranches can be hours away from the nearest hardware store, and so they are inclined to utilize the things available to resolve the issue and continue with their jobs. Tools of the trade include, but are not limited to:
- bailing wire
- duct tape
- welders
- hand tools

I have seen ratchet wrenches used as pins to hold things together, have seen things welded together that ideally would have just been replaced, etc"
Shitty_Car_Mods,f7zbg9k,t1_f7z3ejr,1574108238.0,"Haha. Basically redneck started as a term for the Caucasian/white members of the working class that labored outside for their employment. The term originated from the sunburns on the back of the neck, often from being bent over working in fields, planting, etc.

Same reason straw and/or cowboy hats are attributed to rednecks a lot. They were used to cover the neck and face from the sun

I have also had people in the medical field (sigh) heat that I have PTSD and thank me for my service. I did not serve, and that makes me feel a lot of shame when I have to correct them because I am paranoid that someone will think I‚Äôm trying to get sympathy for serving (stolen valor)."
