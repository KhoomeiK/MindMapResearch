>you seem to have made your mind up to go and are trying to justify it to yourself.

As it stands I've actually already said I'm not going and my mum and grandma are asking me to reconsider, although I have conflicting emotions I'm not trying to justify going I'm here to hear opinions but I have read the government guidelines and as I've said and my family has been advised, this situation is allowed"
CoronavirusUK,fmmuxeh,t1_fmmsqwz,1586212562.0,">Someone has said ""Funerals are exempt"" but this applies to the actual funeral service itself. Meeting together elsewhere is not within the guidelines.

The crematorium would have more people than 5 and be a public place, the idea is that as few of us as possible, 5, meet without going out in public.
The guidelines state that:

> only the following should attend: members of the person’s household; close family members; if the deceased has neither household or family members in attendance, then it is possible for a modest number of friends to attend
 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-care-of-the-deceased/guidance-for-care-of-the-deceased-with-suspected-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19#guidance-for-communities-managing-a-death

We would be adhering to the guidelines. While the advice goes on for a long while there is no numerical limit, there is no restriction on where the ceremony should be held (this would effectively be the ceremony), there is no advice other than follow social distancing guidelines and keep 2 metres apart.
The only reason listed for close family members not to attend is if you are displaying symptoms and as usual the guidelines do not acknowledge that you may be spreading the virus without displaying symptoms. 
I am allowed by law to attend this service but am questioning whether I should

Your feelings are valid, I think a lot of people don't feel like their disorder fits medical criteria or matches another sufferers symptoms but eating disorders or ED behaviours are dangerous.

I started off just purging normal sized meals or even purging restricted low-cal meals and snacks because I felt like I didn't want to have food in me, it was like a fear of food over a fear of gaining weight.

>Can you check the web address and see if it is on the development and alumni relations office sub-site?

It's not, the web link stems from my degree subject, then a module within the degree (my professors module), then 'news', then there are tags on the article. I don't know much what this means but the URL doesn't have any mention of alumni, just the tags.

I was concerned about this, it was published way after I graduated.

Yeah, it really is just about the event. I think my professor also only meant to promote the event. I don't know why she would have even named me unless she wrongly assumed I would like the credit, I definitely didn't ask for my name attached.
