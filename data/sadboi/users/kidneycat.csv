I can't say if she will cheat on you or not, I don't know her, but hopefully this is just talk.   


If you want to stop that, when you all are \*not\* angry, sit her down, touch her leg or arm or something so she can physically feel you and tell her when she says things like that it hurts you.

bigdickproblems,f7mulhf,t1_f7msa1e,1573874205.0,I'm having a big dick problem. I assume guys who are tuned into their partners needs may have troubleshot these issues before. Thanks though. If I don't get an answer I'll try there

BPDmemes,f7h0x8j,t3_dvzigw,1573728202.0,"The other night. Best sex of my life. Afterwards I make it so awkward by telling him I'm starting to feel things, he says good, he wants a relationship. I ask him to clarify 5 times and insist I'd be fine with a friend's with benefits deal. He says no, he wants a relationship. I go home and literally weep. I can't trust this perfect person. How dare he make me feel things. 

Alternatively, I still hang out with my ex because I think we can be friends despite barely being able to hold a conversation. 

They can't abandon you if they're not there for you in the first place? Thanks brain, you dumb."
AskReddit,f7e2ouw,t3_dvihg2,1573643601.0,Where do you get off?
BPD,f7cf69c,t1_f7cedpd,1573590935.0,"I don't know. I wish I did. I don't think her feelings are fake - she keeps finding you. I don't know if she has the skills to handle her feelings though. It's a lot of work. I don't have the will, personally, to do long distance.   


I never feel bad about being the one to love though. It hurts when someone doesn't return it, but it's a true thing and worth doing. If I were you, I'd lay my cards out sincerely and ask for her reaction. It's so hard you can't be there in person. Also, disclaimer, I am not a mentally healthy person and I could be giving you advice I'd take, which might hurt me.   


Good luck. I'm sorry."
BPD,f7cdv4r,t1_f7cd2jg,1573590112.0,"It's like chasing a scared dog... if you've ever tried that. You can chase them for blocks, calling their names. But take a seat on the ground and let them know you're non-threatening and they might come over.  


You all have a long history. Chances are, even if she splits now, she'll be back. You need to start questioning if you'll let her though, I guess."
