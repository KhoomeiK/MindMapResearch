Do you also feed live food? There's studies that show cresties actually eat more insects than previously thought. Have a google to find the studies. The idea is that fruit isn't available all year round so makes sense that part of the year more insects are consumed. Also, analysis of wild crestie poop showed pollen, flowers, seeds, various insects, fruits and mammals were part of their diet.

tarantulas,fppzwsy,t3_gevz2f,1588812406.0,"I don't think the attitude towards tarantulas or spiders in general are gunna change anytime soon. Fear of spiders is probably a good fear to have in parts of the world where you have deadly spiders. Would you teach your kids that spiders don't want to hurt you when you have black widows on your doorstep and then possibly trying to pick one up because ""mama said it doesn't want to hurt me""?

Now, tarantulas aren't gunna kill you unless you're allergic and can't get to a hospital. But most people don't know that. To most people it's a big hairy death machine because bigger size must mean more ""poison"" right? And Old Worlds pack a good punch too so the fear is justified in those regions once again.

Add some hollywood magic into these already deep rooted fears across the world and you have a good villain. You gotta admit, spiders look pretty villain-like. They are so alien looking, many are fast, they come out at night, they have venom and eat other living things. It's easy then to spin a story out of that.

Attitudes are not gunna change so my advice is to not take comments you see on the internet seriously. No one is gunna come into your home and kill all your spiders. The comments of ""kill it with fire"" are just a meme at this point"

CrestedGecko,fpltv3b,t1_fplqhjr,1588719367.0,"Do you need IMO in front of every sentence to realise its an opinion? Thats irrelevant anyway.

I agree it can be bad to give some animals bigger enclosures. Throwing an adult thats lived all its life in a small tank into a huge enclosure is probably not a good idea. Young ones should be fine though. However, I've seen people put animals into bigger enclosures but not add more hiding spots or clutter than was in their previous tank. Most reps like to hide and feel secure and big open spaces aren't good. 

I've seen people recommend 12x12x18 as minimum. I've seen reputable reptile shops selling ""starter kits"" with 12x12x18 tanks. I've seen ""experts"" on recommend that same tank. And ****IMO**** that is wayyy too small.

What makes you think a house is the equivalent of a minimum enclosure? Maybe its more like a shed than a house. Plus, if a ""mansion"" is an extra Â£40 maybe go that extra mile. Not gunna break the bank..."
CrestedGecko,fpli10g,t1_fpkawmo,1588713071.0,"No facts here, just opinions dude. Thats why I typed IMO... And I'll shame anyone who keep animals in tiny enclosures. However I am not shaming OP for theirs as they are asking for advice and that enclosure isn't tiny, just not quite big enough... IMO

How do you know cresties are thriving in 20 gal? Basic functions such as eat, poop and shed are not proof of good husbandry. Reptiles are hardy creatures and put up with lots of abuse. They hide their problems well. I can't prove a crestie is thriving in a big enclosure and you can't prove smaller is better. My reasoning for bigger is better is that the wild is rather large... It can't hurt to provide more space than the minimum. Plus you get more from them as they can display more behaviours and explore more"
CrestedGecko,fpjbi08,t1_fpj7zk6,1588662598.0,"Read the replies quickly and seemed like 2 others were suggesting its too small and still seems that way to me after rereading. Anyway that doesn't matter. IMO its too small for an adult.

I'm of the idea that bigger is always better, provided its setup well, eg, not just a huge open space with little in it. I'm sure you could keep a crestie in that enclosure or even much smaller for its whole life and it would survive. But I think we as animal lovers should opt for the best we can provide, not the minimum. Its a living thing and we have a duty to care for it and provide as natural a home as possible. Whether the animal gives a shit, no one really knows. But I feel better giving my animals beyond the minimum. And if someone's reasoning for not providing above the minimum is money or its too time consuming, then don't keep animals"
CrestedGecko,fpilq9t,t3_gdoa5x,1588643533.0,"Like others say, too small for an adult. I'd even recommend bigger than an 18x18x24 too, although I keep mine i  one that size.
