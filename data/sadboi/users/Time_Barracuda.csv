They've always used that to dominate and oppress women- not only will they kill YOU if you don't capitulate to their needs, they'll also kill your kids. Men built an entire society based around this oppression where they own everything and control all resources, including the lives of women who were one step above livestock. Misogyny has historically been no different than the hate slave owners have for their slaves. The historical period of women being able to claim personhood and have an equal voice in society has been a relative blink of an eye. Men are still entirely aware of how convenient it would be to go back to the old ways of enslaving women and deeply resent the fact that modern society has prevented them from exercising absolute control over the women in their lives as their ancestors did. Hence, misogyny as it exists today."
collapse,fq1r3px,t3_gggszl,1589048248.0,"Its so tough. I was 2 when Reagan was elected, and I consider his election the real benchmark of things getting dramatically harder in the US, so things have been getting worse my whole life. Its only occurred to me very recently that this is not the universal human condition- lots of people in other eras can look at the world and see that life has gotten easier and better for them and the people around them. I see a world that has gotten more luxurious, with more superficial entertainment options and escapism, but also more cynical, more militaristic, more simplistic, more shallow, and brutally competitive. 

Capitalism's tendency to commodify every possible aspect of life has reached deeply into our interpersonal relationships, and has created a 'superior' market solution to every human social need- we seem to live in a world where we get our relationship needs fulfilled by therapists, porn, video games and social media even as we treat the real human beings around us with casual distance, distrust and disdain. People are disposable- if your parent, lover, child or best friend is too much trouble, just cut them off, throw them out, they're toxic, there's always a perfect person around the corner who can fulfill you in a way the real people in your life can't. Relationships are gritty and messy, they go through rough spots, people can be troublesome, but so can WE. Loyalty has become a game for suckers, but loyalty is a two way street- when we treat people like objects we will be treated the same way, and we're aware of that- we force ourselves to be appealing and cheerful, because being authentic and honest will get you ghosted. This leads to relationships that rarely progress beyond the acquaintance stage, because we can never take the risk of lowering our facade. Is it any wonder so many of us are lonely? 

I count myself lucky for having lived the first 25 years of my life in a pre-internet world, when relationships occurred face to face, romance was organic, and friendships were based on a deep understanding of each other's lives and a sense that we valued each other despite our flaws and dark shadows, not because those things were permanently hidden. I have 3 friends I'm sure I'll know until one of us are dead, and I have been madly, passionately in love with someone and had an awesome sex life with that person, for years. I see a lot of younger people who don't seem to have ever had those connections, and sometimes seem to think those things are myths or wishful thinking, because they've been so thoroughly fenced off from genuine connection with other people, even their parents and siblings. Their lives are centered around work- they think nothing of leaving a happy partnership for a job opportunity because they think they can just hop on tinder and get a replacement. And the relationships I see coming from online dating look so strange to me- no passion, no chemistry, no sense of playfulness and trust, just a series of boxes checked off until a list of requirements is met, like a consumer selecting a product, or like an arranged marriage. My heart breaks for what younger people are missing out on, which is nothing less than an organic and genuine human experience- maybe its better for their sake that they don't know."
stupidpol,fpwmt6q,t3_gfwgv1,1588966220.0,"The diversity industry is so hypocritical- they'll accept some kinds of diversity but not others. A big corp will hire an attractive light skinned black woman with a white northern accent who grew up on the east coast and went to an Ivy League university when they'd never hire a dark skinned heavyset southern black woman who went to a state university. How can anyone claim that's diversity when the box of acceptability has been made larger but not eliminated, and economic and geographic privilege is still being rewarded over accomplishment and merit? 

The diversity industry is also perfectly aligned with what is probably the biggest source of discrimination in the job market currently- the ironclad requirement for advanced degrees to be hired in any decent job. Doesn't matter the profession, you can be a genius in your field and never move above a designated job level because you couldn't afford the money and time in your youth to jump through the increasingly meaningless hoops of higher education. Aside from a few life-or-death professions (doctors, construction engineers etc.) all this does is fence off most professions as the purview of the children of the rich or those willing and able to shoulder lifelong debt for a ticket into the professional world. This is totally a transparent fact of life and widely accepted, but also obviously discriminatory. The requirement to attain higher education punishes those who dare to try to rise above their station, and deadens social mobility, but because its not tied to race or sex its invisible."

Here's the example I always think of, one I think most women will agree is 100% realistic: a middle aged woman is standing in a long line after Christmas to return some items. There are 5 men in front of her. 3 of them don't have receipts but the cashier (a young white guy) ""gives them a break"" and lets them all return their items anyway. She's relieved because she doesn't have the receipt either, but apparently its not going to be a problem. When her turn comes the cashier scowls disdainfully at her as she walks up to the counter. He speaks to her with condescension and disrespect, and absolutely REFUSES to process her returns without a receipt. 

What is she supposed to do? Put up with this rank discrimination and let this 22 year old walk all over her? She needs to get her money back, but this guy is power tripping on her and refusing to bend the rules for her, as he's done for every other customer, just because he can.

God demonstrates who is in the elect by showering his favorites with riches and good fortune.

stupidpol,fosiwez,t3_g97ef8,1588031591.0,"My moment to shine! I voted for Jesse in my first election when he ran for gov and I have no regrets. I can tell you why he got elected because I watched the race unfold: it was all about the debates. On one hand, we had the Republican nominee Norm Coleman, the absolute epitome of an oily, dishonest politician- seriously, this guy came off as a political villain in a B movie. On the democratic side was Walter Mondale (yes, that Mondale, no, not his son or grandson) who was so old and tired they basically had to wheel him out on a gurney. He didn't even seem to want to be there. And then there was Jesse- this relatively young, undeniably sharp working class guy who wore his heart on his sleeve and came across as honest and passionate- a genuine centrist with the interests of the middle class at the center of his campaign. He wasn't a perfect candidate, but he was by far the best candidate in the running. It was such a shock when he won- a lot of people were very excited, but unfortunately the national media decided to make a big joke out of his election and portray Minnesotans as a bunch of hayseed ignoramuses. Minnesotans are very thin skinned and image conscious- they're a lot more urbane and sophisticated than you'd guess, and calling them hicks really hit them in their sore spot. A lot of them got embarrassed and responded by turning on Jesse. Suddenly his base did a cowardly about turn and he was left flapping in the wind. I really blame the electorate for his failure as a governor- they sold him out because they couldn't handle the slightest criticism. It obviously wounded him to be abandoned and sapped his will to govern and political clout. To this day I think he could've been an important political voice if the people who voted for him had had the guts to stand behind their choice."
Anger,fosaruf,t1_fos13yx,1588027093.0,"Fuck that guy, but frankly, people like that aren't worth your anger. You're probably all jittery with adrenaline now, which never feels good, and you already know you accomplished nothing. When I have interactions like that I basically think 'well now I know you're an idiot' and write them off as a person. They go on my 'stay the hell away from' list. Getting aggressive only makes awkwardness and friction- better to just walk away and avoid them. I know it can feel like backing down, like somehow you're letting yourself down by not blowing up on him, but try to think of it more like going to a restaurant, getting bad food or service, and deciding to never go there again. Impersonal. And I don't think there's any reason to apologize- don't spend energy or time on idiots. They wouldn't do the same for you, and if you apologize he'll just gloat over it."

Its his central flaw, and a fact that even his supporters, in their deepest depths can't deny. That gives it power beyond any other gaffe. It reminds me of Romney's ""47% of Americans are takers"" scandal that probably cost him the election- it confirmed what people already suspected, that he was a cutthroat social darwinist, and, worse, a snob. That comment revealed the rot in him we already knew was there. This fiasco reveals that same rotten core in Trump- that he really is as stupid as he seems to be."

righttodie,fogo0g5,t3_g6y7qr,1587754979.0,"I think its primitive, hypocritical and ethically suspect that euthanasia is not legal and is so taboo. There's several interlocking reasons that make euthanasia illegal, the largest being that people want to selfishly cling to the idea that 'life is a gift, life is always worth living, things will get better'. If they make the mental leap to allow themselves to think that maybe, for some people, life ISNT a gift and ISNT worth living it forces them to also consider the value of their own life and the lives of their loved ones. 

As an example, I have a cousin born with spinabifida who has spent every day of her life in a wheelchair. She deals with constant infections and pressure sores, she's very poor, and generally has a pretty pitiful quality of life. She's a lovable, kind person and quite bright. Nevertheless it's likely that for a lot of people her life would not be worth living. Denial of euthanasia as a possible solution for her suffering makes life easier for the many people that love her, but it traps her in a life of suffering she's never had any choice about. I don't know where she stands on the topic of euthanasia because she's not really allowed to talk about it, and to bring it up with her would seem unspeakably cruel. She's trapped in a body that tortures her every day for no real reason at all- she'll eventually die like all the rest of us, but she's not allowed to even think about hastening that outcome to avoid the pain and struggle of her life. Its a monstrous way to treat people, especially the sick and vulnerable. I also find it bizarre that fetuses who have the same disability she does are frequently aborted today, but as soon as those people are born the decision of whether to live or die is taken from them. I suspect that her mom would've made that choice if she'd had access to those prenatal tests when she was pregnant with my cousin, but because my cousin was born before that medical tech came into use all she gets is 'tough shit, you gotta live'. Its an intolerably nonsensical and hypocritical stance to take, but here we are.

I'm also suspicious of financial motives in forcing people to live intolerable lives. Life extending medical 'care' inflicted on the sick, in pain, and dying is a HUGE cash cow for the medical system. If it became common for people to check out of life before things got really bad for them medical spending would drastically decline. Denying people the right to die means we have to choose between getting treatment and a slow, torturous death means most will choose treatment just to stave off a painful end. There's big bucks to be made on the agony and fear of the sick and dying.

Finally, I find the refusal to allow euthanasia in a world where we allow abortion, discontinuation of medical treatment, executions, and being sent off to die in wars intolerably hypocritical and illogical. If you allow those things I can't see how you can deny people their right to choose to end their own lives. Its bald faced stupidity, and a system no one should be forced to live under."

I had a couple of girls in jr high/highschool that had little crushes on me. I'm straight so it was a no-go, but I was never once threatened by them, and didn't even feel perved on or leered at in a sexual way. Those were the only times I ever felt flattered by a crush, and my main emotion was sadness for them that they were barking up the wrong tree and a hope that they could find a receptive partner. I've NEVER felt that way when experiencing wanted pursuit from a man. Even now, 30 years later, I remember those girls fondly and hope they're doing well."

Guys like this buy womanhood from a doctor, and get offended by their failure to sell sex to their friends. He's thoroughly disdainful of the idea of seduction and rapport building, as if love is a retrograde phenomena that should be jettisoned in favor of an exchange of money for goods. They've turned the commodification of every human interaction and emotion into a laudable, progressive goal, and seem to be striving toward a society where humanity is a calculation of dollars and cents. I really wonder if these people would also approve of buying and selling organs, or the ability to sell oneself into slavery- those are both ideas totally in line with their philosophy of capitalism as the greatest good. Its like they've been steeped in some toxic brew of autism, sociopathy and libertarianism and they're trying to reshape the world into one giant red light district based around the worst impulses of humanity."
