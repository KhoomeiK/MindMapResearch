Anxiety,fpuhzwu,t3_g8v0l8,1588913396.0,So so much yes. I have to go back to work next week and I’m so anxious about it. I’m legit dreading it. I’m so anxious about wearing a mask. I’m just ugh all over the place.
BPD,fi9bnjd,t3_f6vlao,1582260724.0,I agree with others that this post put sooo many things together for me thank you
BPD,fi9b2ac,t1_fi88gv4,1582260236.0,I was looking for an answer like this. I was young when mine started. And my obsession went on for years. I still feel a weird attachment 20 plus years later and it makes me feel so uncomfortable to think about.
depression,fge6nnv,t1_ffzd06k,1580692582.0,Thank you for this!!
selfhelp,fge6kd0,t1_ffz8eld,1580692523.0,Yes totally. I walk into therapy and she says what’s on your mind? Or the worst was the first time? What brings you in? Ummmm I have no idea🤦‍♀️
selfhelp,ffz5ya0,t1_ffxoo2m,1580365052.0,Oh I relate so hard to this!!
selfhelp,ffz5sb1,t1_ffwgy4l,1580364916.0,I’m literally going to my doctor tomorrow and am so worried about this!!
depression,ffyoamu,t3_evvkt1,1580351169.0,Asking for help is by far the hardest thing I e ever done. I’m not brave. I’m just desperate. You’re not alone
depression,ffynlnt,t1_ffyeb7h,1580350692.0,Oh that’s so hard though
depression,ffynkac,t1_ffyean9,1580350666.0,Seems to work alright. If they make you feel like that maybe they don’t get to be around you
depression,ffye3da,t1_ffyctqk,1580344224.0,I tend to use the avoidance coping mechanism lol so I’m no help 🤦‍♀️
depression,ffydfdv,t1_ffybcf2,1580343775.0,I’m scared this is going to happen to me. I’m going tomorrow to talk to a doctor about my first antidepressants. Well technically second. Years ago I was on one that did nothing and I stopped taking them and never went back. What if I’m just broken and there’s no hope to feel better. Maybe that’s why I haven’t done this sooner. I’m scared that may be the case.
depression,ffyd66b,t3_evvpym,1580343603.0,I so totally could have wrote this!! I don’t think I’m faking or wanting to suffer so I really doubt that you are. I hate that we come across that way
depression,ffycnti,t3_evvrlv,1580343260.0,I’m so far from an expert but I see you still have no responses yet so here goes. Sounds like anxiety and maybe ptsd. Definitely worth looking into more imo. Sending hugs!
depression,ffphsss,t3_eufm9r,1580095381.0,I’ve been doing this so much lately. I feel crazy
depression,ffnfl0q,t3_eu991v,1580065331.0,I feel like a horrible mom all the time. No advice but I understand. I love them so much but why did I bring them into this world of suffering
depression,ffnf5id,t3_eu9htf,1580065185.0,You definitely should. Took me years of thinking maybe I’m not depressed. It’s not strong enough. I’m happy sometimes- to realize that I am. I can go years totally fine and it’ll hit me like a ton of bricks. I’m super deep in it now so sorry if this doesn’t make sense but yes. Don’t compare yourself to others. If you’re suffering get some help.
BPD,ffikinp,t1_ffieta7,1579976057.0,Well that’s sweet thanks
depression,ffhfl51,t3_etlaog,1579933169.0,Yup. I shouldn’t have had kids. I don’t know what I was thinking. Between passing on my awful genes and not being able to be there like I should I’m definitely not doing well
BPD,ffhek8b,t1_ffg8rh2,1579932008.0,But I do have to hide. No one wants to know the truth
BPD,ffg6g17,t3_etgee0,1579899470.0,Yup. Every day for the past month
depression,ffg1e96,t3_etcurs,1579896357.0,Yes and yes
BPD,fffqtae,t3_et2s8a,1579889796.0,Yes yes definitely yes
BPD,fffq6di,t1_ffe50bs,1579889401.0,Same
BPD,ff8b7ws,t1_ff5ohqs,1579671609.0,Me please!
BPD,ff8axvq,t3_es6ern,1579671339.0,Yes yes yes ugghhh
sex,fb32woj,t1_famokzx,1576463014.0,Thank you! Where do you find couples quizzes?
depression,f6hd4pj,t1_f69juwk,1572843638.0,I totally relate to the sleep thing. It used to be my escape. I longed to lay down each night. Now it just causes anxiety and I don’t have that calm to look forward to😭
depression,f6h74of,t3_cml6ni,1572838626.0,Not great. Not horrible but not great. Someone reached out to me but I feel like if I open up I’m cheating on my boyfriend. Plus I wouldn’t even know how to open up. I can’t open up to my boyfriend - he doesn’t get it. Honestly even if I did talk it wouldn’t fix anything or make it better. I. Just. Don’t. Know.
depression,f6h69er,t1_f6gudrw,1572838024.0,Back on a private account. Because anxiety. Send the note. I wish I thought of that.
