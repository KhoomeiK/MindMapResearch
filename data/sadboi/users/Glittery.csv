leagueoflegends,f6vblpf,t3_cs33wc,1573181690.0,I just got permabanned. They will not forgive you. They look at your record. Mine was over seven years. I advise honestly never using chat again.
SuicideWatch,f57tzlh,t3_dkfkaq,1572043306.0,"Yes. I feel like I cannot escape the toxicity that my family surrounds me with. Everytime I get close to happiness, it is like it is a tease and i can never reach a point where i think everything is going to be okay. I am always jerked right back into the bullshit. Money, manipulation, facades. No one believes me because no one cares to or they believe the facade. If it wasnt for my s/o, i would be gone by now. I feel like it is still inevitable that I will be consumed by this  I feel like i was never meant to find happiness. I just want to be gone right now. I am tired of this, and I cant do it anymore."

SuicideWatch,exnvj9q,t1_exmze6t,1566464401.0,"I dont believe you. People are the reason I am in this predicament. Exercise doesnt change the actions of others that hurt. Nutrition doesnt change that either. Jobs bring drama and greedy people. My thinking cannot be changed because the other methods are disproven by the actions of those around me. I am a misanthrope. it is rare to find a gem of a human being that isnt an unintelligent sack of cells. Routines remind me of how i didnt achieve what i wanted in this life because of circumstances beyond my control. It was too late to correct them or do anything about it. It is too late. No amount of nutrition or exercise will fix that. Routine is a constant reminder that i repeat what i never intended to do or how to end up. And here i am, trying to make the best of how fucked up i have become."
