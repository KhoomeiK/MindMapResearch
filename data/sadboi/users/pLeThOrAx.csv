Psilocybin is another option, though not as powerful. Before you go on a trip, which is a bit of a loaded word, let's maybe instead say before you embark on an experience/journey. Set a conscious intention. Maybe think about a particular idea or word that comes from your higher self. We all have a higher self, as well as what I like to call the ""human self"" and I'm learning at the moment that its important for your higher self to take the wheel. There are substances to help you get back in tune with your higher self. To allow it to regain control. Im happy to share with you as best I can. I've been personally struggling with treatment resistant depression and anxiety for the past 6 years (meaning antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds) and addiction is a bit of a tender issue in my life at the moment. Psychedelics have been literally the most powerful and transformative treatment to my state of being. You could look into r/microdosing as one option. If you're in a safe enough environment and maybe are fortunate to have a sitter with you (someone experienced with tripping) you could maybe embark on a threshold dose trip (perhaps a tab or two of lsd).

I hate to be advocating more drugs, but with regards to ""harm reduction"" this definitely falls in-line with that. You're more than welcome to look into some research about heavy drug abuse recovery through psychedelics like LSD. It's a thing! I'm here if you need anything.
