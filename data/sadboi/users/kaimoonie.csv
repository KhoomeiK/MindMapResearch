Also, keep in mind that the base color will affect how the dye turns out (which is what happened to you, yellow/orange + blue = green). To cancel out the green, you'll need a color that's leaning a bit more towards red than what you want, for example if you wanna go purple, go for a more red purple.

Two weeks ago my boyfriend started to develop symptoms and was later (monday) tested positive. Over the course of the week everyone of the family (aka me and his parents, who are both risk patients) got it.
Today, two weeks later, he's got over a slight cough and some fever, along with circulatory issues, and I, after 3 days of vomiting because my birth control messes up my stomach as soon as I get sick, was practically fine.
Even his parents with their preexisting conditions are quite well, apart from some coughing. Though we were all pretty worried.
Basically what I wanted to say with this is, that statistically speaking, if you were to catch the virus, you will most likely not be affected much apart from having to stay home. It's going to be fine, okay?
Stay safe and healthy!!!"

And whereas computers may be doing quite well with facial recognition, humans, especially gifted ones, are still superior, since we actually have a part of the brain specifically designated to recognising human faces, the Fusiform Face Area."
AskReddit,fel6dyn,t1_fel4gnx,1579215034.0,"So I quickly hopped onto my computer and luckily I still have the paper :)

So there actually is a test called ""Cambridge Face Memory Test"" (CMFT) that was invented in 2006 by Bradley Duchaine and Ken Nakayama specifically to diagnose facial blindness (Prosopagnosia), and was later also used to find Super Recognisers. It consists of 3 stages with varying difficulty in which the subject first has to memorize one face in 3 different angles and then has to recognise that face amongst 3 different ones. There's also a long version of this.

Then there's the Cambridge Face Perception Test (CFPT), invented by the same two people plus Laura T. Germine. In this tests the subject has to sort 6 faces in order of similarity to a sample face. They have to do 8 sets normally and 8 upside down, each in under a minute.

I guess there's also other methods, but those are the ones I know. Let me know if you have any questions about this (or just google it, it's super interesting) :)"
