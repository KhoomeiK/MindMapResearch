misophonia,fd0mlft,t3_ejryjd,1578120925.0,"Personally I find it helps when I eat the same time someone else is eating. Also playing white noise with earphones is very helpful as it blocks out the minuscule noises that I find to be very noticeable, yet others do not – your boyfriend probably finds this too. 

I love the app called “white noise”. Also have the TV on, either playing music or just a random channel to add some background noise. 

He’s very lucky to have someone as caring as you, usually people are quick to dismiss the legitimacy of our illness so thank you for trying your best to refrain from being triggering, I know it can be really difficult."

To my knowledge, the percent of people with synesthesia is indeed above 4% of the population, approximately more than the population of America, to put that into perspective.

She deleted it shortly after I explained to her that it’s not okay to go fishing for a mental illness. She was so eager to be diagnosed with something. She said that whenever she had an indication that she had a “mental illness” she would take an online quiz. I don’t believe her functioning in life was obscured, she just wanted to be different and quirky. And whenever the opportunity arose, she diagnosed herself with yet another mental illness. 

Society needs to learn how to tell the difference between actual mental illness and normal human emotions. Being sad does NOT mean you are depressed, likewise for occasionally feeling anxious during the appropriate situations."

Perhaps you should ask your dad to see a therapist because of how you’re feeling (anxious, stressed etc.) and that you’d find it beneficial to talk to someone, rather than because you believe you may have a mental disorder. Then you’ll be able to rule out such with a professional."
mentalillness,fcm8ywb,t3_ehwe2c,1577767440.0,You’re only option is to see a professional if your mental state is causing you distress. Online quizzes are extremely unreliable and vague so you shouldn’t use them to self diagnose.

So a good tip would be to immediately let someone know if they’re making a noise that triggers you and to leave the situation if possible. Also always have headphones on you."

misophonia,fb8iv3j,t1_fb89473,1576614896.0,"Why might you need to list your triggers? Why is it impossible to do exactly that – discuss our misophonia and how it affects our lives, just without explicitly describing and listing all our triggers? As I have mentioned in previous comments, i believe that for a more mindful and sensible subreddit we should refrain from doing so as this can trigger a lot of us. Instead we should use terms such as mouth, nose noises and or movement etc. instead. And of course if more detail is required then it can be mentioned later on with a trigger warning rather than being scattered throughout a text."
misophonia,fb7478q,t1_fb72ba1,1576572997.0,"I get your point, however I’m mostly referring to individuals who explicitly describe very specific triggers. I believe we should use terms such as mouth, nose noises and or movement in replacement of quiet sniffling, loud lip smacking etc. of course details such as this can be asked for in the comments of someone’s post, which also gives a heads up to whoever may be reading. It’s a win-win.

Not to mention that the misophonia support subreddit has even more people doing what I am against. Also, this subreddit is mostly used by people venting and talking about their “feelings”, perhaps even more so than the misophonia support sub."

misophonia,fb64jhh,t1_fb63y5q,1576541202.0,That’s not what I meant of course. Obviously one with misophonia doesn’t want to be unnecessarily triggered nor develop more triggers. This subreddit shouldn’t cause this and should be a “safe space” for us to escape our constant struggle in the real world and connect with those who fee the same. This should be possible without feeling on edge due to the anticipation of reading a descriptive recount of someone else’s triggers.
misophonia,fb63qu8,t1_fb62l6f,1576540633.0,"Our entire illness is caused by triggers we avoid at all costs. Why not focus on how our triggers make us feel, who causes us to feel this way and how we cope. It’s ridiculous how we can’t even say the word th*rapy.

Something along the lines of: I have misophonia, which is a neurological disorder that makes it difficult for me to process certain noises. I would really appreciate it if you would chew with your mouth closed as it really effects me, causing me to become enraged, anxious etc.
