anime,fkljpcg,t1_fklj9in,1584307859.0,"Thanks. Tbh there could've been some improvements which give me small OCD after I published it.
Although the subtitle timing matches, Gil says it slightly earlier. Their total 'Enuma Elish' duration is slightly different I believe so it's not possible to improve that.
There was one of other version with slightly different timing match that they both said 'Elish' simultaneously which was little bit better I think.
There's some audio related stuff but didn't really know better to edit as to make Gil's voice prominent over music and stuff. Might get copyrighted with the music even, idk.
Anyways, pardon my rambling. It had been on my mind all this while."

It's difficult coming to that stage. Even though you realize that current situation is bad. It just doesn't get that worse or that craving that you just get enough of yourself.

It actually sounds like some change happened or a new perspective you got that actually made you say that enough is enough."

SubredditDrama,fhl5u07,t1_fhl4hm4,1581695740.0,"Arthur Pendagron is like the main figure, or postel girl of the Fate series, you can introduce yourself to the anime series with Fate Zero.

Fate Grand Order is a mobile gacha game, which has 'servants' from different different Fate VNs, games, anime etc.

Camelot is the 6th major portion of the story of FGO game. There were 5 similar portions/singularities in game. But the story really bumped up with the 'Camelot' singularity, something akin of a visual novel quality.

I mentioned it specifically, because I was introduced to all the different members of round tables first time through this only. Obviously was aware of Artoria before. But here Bedivere, Lancelot, Gawain, Tristan, Argavain make apperances in the story. Although a different 'version' of Lancelot does make appereance in the Fate Zero anime.

That video I linked, removes all the 'game' portion of the singularity and only contains the dialogues, etc. Wouldn't really recommend watching that directly.

I will suggest watching Fate Zero and playing the game if you're interested to find more."
