I always overthink what I do or say and when it's all said and done I feel like shit lol cause I just think I messed it up. Or I didn't live up to the moments full potential.
Anxiety,euj4v0m,t3_cgo3am,1563862487.0,"Maybe it's not for you man but that don't mean anything. You could be hilarious but you're probably judging yourself too harshly, which I do constantly. I bet you make more people happy than you think. I feel just about the same way you do, aimless and just confused as all fuck on what I want to do. But the end is very very far away for us both, don't lose hope and find something you like to do and try your hardest to not worry about the future cause nothing is set in stone."
Anxiety,euj43p8,t3_cgo4jn,1563861944.0,"No judgement here man. I think the exact same shit that's why I don't have a bunk bed lol. Does someone else sleep on top? If not I wouldn't be worried at all, if so maybe switch it up and you can get a feel of how strong the top is."
Anxiety,euj3pt7,t3_cgo9hg,1563861672.0,What's the story friend? No judgement here.
Anxiety,euf7r65,t3_cg7qn6,1563765044.0,YES. This is why I feel like I don't even know myself. I feel stupid afterwards and just cringe at the thought of it
Anxiety,eueh2ol,t3_cg3zto,1563744211.0,"Id say that's anxiety. Im 20 now and that's pretty much how I started out, it'll definitely get better and might just go away, hard to tell. You'll notice it getting better overtime but for now I don't have much advice cause I was the same way. Maybe talking to your parents will ease your mind or even a therapist."
Anxiety,euebwnv,t1_eue9ri0,1563740508.0,"Man that's true, I'm in the same boat. Being lead on and having anxiety is a terrible combo"
Anxiety,euc903a,t3_cfrtbm,1563668397.0,I feel you friend. All I think about is shit I did wrong or didn't do because I was too nervous.
