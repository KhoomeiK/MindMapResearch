That's why he lied, which I consider the lesser of his two sins at the end of the game. I think murdering the doctor and shooting Marlene in the face when she was already incapacitated is way worse than lying to Ellie.

I also understand the argument that the Fireflies didn't give Ellie the opportunity to consent, but she fucking would have. Joel and Marlene cover this before he kills her. I theorize the reason Marlene gave the go ahead on the operation is that she didn't think she could give the order if she talked to Ellie again. Marlene loved Anna, Ellie's mom, and had been watching over Ellie since she was born. She had also just lost a lot of men on their journey from Boston, so she was already emotionally beaten down. She probably would have broken down and not been able to make the hard decision to go through with it if she didn't make a split second decision to go through with the operation while Ellie was still unconscious.

I'm also going to contest your stance on how the Fireflies would have used the cure in their own self-interest. I felt the story positioned them as the last remaining source of optimism in the world. I believe they would have used the cure to restore order and fight back against the martial law of the quarantine zones. Joel even refers to Ellie as the cure for mankind when trying to convince Tommy to take her, because it was his cause. I don't think Tommy's cause was to put himself in an abusive place of power."

lastofuspart2,fq0eyre,t1_fpy3orm,1589030880.0,"I feel a lot of people don't get that Joel becomes the villain at the end of TLoU. It's like they are trying to rationalize Joel's choice when they shouldn't be. Joel didn't bust out a pen, paper, and calculator and start crunching the numbers on the probability of the Fireflies finding a cure. He decided his love for Ellie was more important than the greater good and did a bad thing. Why else would he lie to Ellie?

I believe Neil even says in the making-of documentary, Grounded (available for viewing on the PS4 remaster), that the reason they put you in control of Ellie at the very end is that now Joel is the antagonist. I've seen people talk about how he deserves a hero's death and that's just not true. Now if the story unfolded where Joel gets a redemption arc where he sacrifices himself to save Abby and Ellie, that would be a well deserved hero's death. As it stands though, Joel is no hero."
lastofuspart2,fpy0ok7,t1_fpxw9r2,1588993487.0,"Thank you for your reply. I understand your grievances, but there are key aspects I disagree with. I'm not going to go into detail, because I already left a thorough reply on u/jcmiller210's comment in this thread and I would basically be repeating myself. If you're interested, you can check that out. I will say that Abby is not a random person; Hunter #69 and Cannibal #420 were random people. Also, I don't agree Joel DESERVES (capitalized for emphasis) a hero's death, even if it would be nice. Although ""nice"" is not a term I would use to describe TLoU's universe."
lastofuspart2,fpxz1v1,t1_fpxme82,1588992514.0,"I feel we will have to agree to disagree in regards to the way Joel is scrutinized as a villain, but I appreciate your response. 

Personally, I feel Joel is undeniably the villain of TLoU. What sets him apart from other villains is that he is extremely well written and we relate to him, because we grew to love Ellie alongside him. During my first playthrough, was I literally saying outloud that Joel needs to kill that Firefly and save Ellie's life? Fuck yes. I had an orgasm when Joel said, ""I don't have time for this,"" and shot the Firefly. Was that indicative of me being a good person? Abso-fucking-lutely no. 

I don't think the Fireflies were in the wrong. They had a chance to create a cure/vaccine, so they had to sacrifice one girl to save humanity. It's just as Marlene told Joel: That's what Ellie would have wanted and he fucking knew it. 

There is certainly an argument there that operating and killing Ellie wouldn't guarantee the Fireflies would find a cure, but focusing on that minute detail kind of diminishes the impact of TLoU's conclusion. Rationalizing Joel's choice cheapens the emotional aspect by trying to make it a logical choice.

Objectively, it should be easy to sympathize with Abby. She lost her father, because a crazy man destroyed her family and doomed humanity by saving a little girl. While the game was marred in shades of gray, Joel's final decision was a black and white one. He made an evil choice that we all would have made, as much as we don't want to admit it our own selfishness. That difficulty is what made TLoU special. Part 2 seems to aim to make us address those darker parts of our personalities, which is special in its own way."

lastofuspart2,fpcsnku,t1_fpclqon,1588511582.0,"I know Joel told Ellie there had been multiple immune survivors, but I don't remember anything actually corroborating that in the game. I always considered that statement a part of his lie. Is there something I missed?

Fair point about Arthur and John being bad people, but it's still not a perfect comparison. While they were outlaws, the narrative always framed them as bandits with a high moral code. This is displayed almost immediately in the way Sadie is treated by the O'Driscoll's vs. the Van Der Linde gang. There's additional evidence to this by the way members of the gang react to Dutch when he does evil deeds like killing the girl on the ferry (done off screen) and I seem to remember Arthur being rubbed the wrong way when a woman is killed in cold blood while they are shipwrecked.

You also have a fair point regarding Abby's reason for killing Joel, but I don't think her personal reason invalidates the objective justice of Joel's death. That's contingent on the first part of this response though. If there were other immune survivors, there is no true justice in Joel's death. That said, I still wouldn't be bothered either way based on the current info we have. I like tragic stories, so the protagonists having a tragic ending isn't a dealbreaker for me as long as it is executed well. Context is key and I don't think we can judge the story's execution without the full game in our hands.

I'm not sure which part of my response is being addressed when you were talking about Marlene losing half her men on the way to SLC (that entire paragraph)."
lastofuspart2,fpckjms,t3_gcncf2,1588503995.0,"It's not like that though. Micah was a selfish and terrible person and got what he deserved at the end of Arthur's story in RDR2. Joel killed innocent people at the hospital to save Ellie, even though that's not what she wanted, because he is a selfish and terrible person. Dude fucking brutally murders all those people and lies to Ellie about what happens with zero hesitation, because he knows he's in the wrong. Abby is the daughter of the doctor that Joel kills in the OR, so her killing the man that sacrificed humanity for this own desires is getting as close to justice as you can in a post-apocalyptic world. If she kills Ellie too, she's a cunt, but Joel's death is 100% justified."

lastofuspart2,fp2prky,t1_fp26dxz,1588265841.0,"I think a lot of game designers (Neil included) view what they do as a form of art rather than creating a product whose sole purpose is to maximize sales. Obviously, a songwriter wants people to buy their album and a filmmaker wants people to buy tickets to their movie, but generally their vision and what they want to say is the most important part to them. Clearly, this is an example of just that. Neil doesn't give a fuck if people that don't share his views play the game that him and his team made (ND upper-management and Sony probably do though). This is the story they want to tell and part of that story involves giving representation to underrepresented demographics.

Personally, I'm still hyped as fuck for this game. The plot points and gameplay elements that I've read about do nothing to make me think this will be a letdown. In fact, I think they are taking some risks that could have awesome payoffs. That is assuming it's done well.

Emo,ey6itld,t3_cvozre,1566856595.0,"Best: Seeing Foxing, TWIABP, and TTNG at the Subterranean in Chicago. It was the first time I ever saw TTNG. Foxing's set was also incredible and Conor busted his nose during ""Bit By a Dead Bee Pt. 1"". That sucked for him, but it was a very memorable night.

Worst: I can't think of one off the top of my head, honestly. I'm very easy to please.

Most fun: Seeing Tiny Moving Parts and Foxing at the Double Door (Chicago). I got to see Conor actually perform his vocal feature on ""Common Cold"".

Saddest: Julien Baker on the Boygenius tour at Thalia Hall (Chicago). I had been listening to ""Turn Off the Lights"" a lot leading up to that show. The line, ""I'd never do it, but it's not a joke,"" had really been sitting heavy with me. Then, Julien changed it to, ""Maybe I'll do it, but it's not a joke."" I felt weird the rest of the night."
