Do you mean you’ve never noticed any hair in the wound? Or like on your butt? I’m not removing hair from the wound just the area around it. 

Usually what I do when it flares up is:

1. Epsom salt baths for 15-20 min I do this after I’ve showered and done a quick clean of my tub. It really helps with pain and just getting the gunk out. 

2. I remove the hair probably once a week. Using a razor or Nair/Veet (hair removal creams) I prefer the creams because I’m prone to getting ingrown hairs and that just makes this whole thing worse.  I continue to do this step even after it’s gone away to just prevent more from coming back, but sometimes I get lazy and it doesn’t happen.

Probably because Lamictals main purpose is to stop hypomania/mania. The depressive episode lasted a month I was absolutely useless and honestly I don’t remember what i even did then it definitely wasn’t homework. 

But I’m totally fine now I started it last March and I’m on 150 mg since November? and I’ve been stable since. The first 3 months I was on 50mg and it worked until It didn’t and I had to go to a higher dose. So don’t be discouraged if you have to continue titratiting up. I took 8 months to get to the point where I can concentrate again, do my homework , and I don’t feel like my brain is going 90 miles an hour 24/7.

You could use hair cream removal for the least amount of time (depending on the brand usually it’s 5min please follow the directions or you will get a chemical burn.

Sit in a hot bath with about 2 cups of Epsom salts, every night for like 15-20 min, until pain goes away and it starts to look better. Also you could apply Prid, It’s a drawing salve it worked for me. I also got one this week, because you’re right all the sitting with online classes can be a literal pain in the ass. So you apply a small bit of Prid and put a bandaid over it. I recommend taking off the bandaid before you bathe and then reapplying the new one after the bath.

When your airways get dried up that allows mucus to accumulate and make breathing difficult. The humidifier/sauna moisturizes the airways making it easier to breathe.

Edited. I am so sorry that this is so long. It’s 2 am and I need to go to sleep. My bad lol. 

[good article about it](https://www.healthline.com/health/polycystic-ovary-disease) 

hair - I’m Italian so I’m already hairy to begin with. It sucks a lot. I have super sensitive skin and I will no matter how hard I try to matter how much I sanitize or moisturize will get ingrown hairs if I shave my legs or face. So I’ve been using Veet  hair removing cream for my legs and after 5 min my black corse hairs are removed.they also come back softer.  I’m getting some cream for my face but I’ve only ever plucked. I do get like a girl stash and do have to shave that. I will one day god willing have enough money for electrolysis(which is technically the only permanent hair remover. Hair removal with laser can comeback especially with any hormonal changes.) 

Tip- cream removal or electrolysis 

Acne - when I was 16 I got cystic acne and got put on tretinoin by my primary care doctor and it worked like a dream. I stopped using it my senior year and I’ve been fine until I changed birth controls recently so I’m going to wait and see what to do about it. I always wash my face twice a day and moisturizer. I’m currently looking for a good OTC  retinoid because I’ve heard it helps a lot with hormonal acne. 

Tip - retinoids, birth control, some get prescribe spironolactone which is for diabetes 


weight - I have stagnant weight. I stayed the same weight from 7th grade to 19. It was an okay weight I was still thin But I did low carb and lost 10 pounds and then maintained. 

Tips - low carb and generally having a healthy life style and metformin also a diabetic drug 

Periods - mine were completely normal no issues. I got them every 28 days for 3-4 days until I got the implant, worst mistake of my life. The pill, Nikki, is so much better. 

Tips - birth control 

Fertility - it’s like a form of infertility but not really. You could get pregnant on your own or you might not. It’s different for everyone. Some people need to take medication to maybe they a little more fertile and some people need surgery. 

Tips - whenever you want to get pregnant go back to your gyno to explore your options 

Mood- so supposedly it can cause mood issues, like depression and anxiety.  However I’m Bipolar and I actually don’t know what to attribute what moods to which illness or even if I’m actually bipolar 2 now ( I most likely still am)  I have a psych appt soon so she should be able to give me some clarity. 

Cancer - you can get cancer from so many things it’s not even funny. It should definitely be the least of your worries, you will definitely notice if you have it. 

Attractiveness - our illness does not define us. We can still be beautiful inside and out. I was the opposite, I felt better when I got diagnosed. I finally had a reason for why I get the black hairs and acne, or that I got depressed. It wasn’t my fault anymore it’s PCOS fault.

pilonidalcyst,fldn06j,t1_flch90v,1585067780.0,"I have never done the cleft lift procedure, but I have had the surgery where they make a deep cut, scoop it out and leave the wound completely open. I have had  it lanced and drained twice which was just a short visit to the urgent care, and I had it surgically removed again later but this time it was small open wound. The only thing that scarred was the small boil or lump that got infected before any of the surgeries, everything else no scar. 

 I was born with the sinus tracks back there and I recommend if it starts draining you’ll want to go back to the doctor. Sitting in hot epsom salt baths and applying antibiotics ointment should help ease some of the soreness. It will be a little tender though right after the bath."

The main goal of the first comment was to potentially give enough education that maybe just maybe someone would decide to go plant based or like I said go cruelty free. Due to the shit that was going on in all the other comments. I thought I made it pretty clear that plant based was the way to go, especially with the whole statement about Americans dying of heart disease and only being able to fix it by eating plant based.

Everyone is different, I’m just glad we have things set in place for those who need it. Although somethings could be improved."

Also our stomach acid is more equip for plants. That’s why if you have GERD you’re suggested to stay away from red meat and fatty foods. 

However yes forcing animals to a purely vegan diet would be unethical and potentially very harmful. 
Same with humans it could be potentially harmful, like any other diet. Americans leading cause of death is heart disease and a main contributor to that is diet. So something isn’t going right. Eating more plant based has been shown to reduce the risk of heart diesease. 

Currently the state that the environment and agriculture industry is in, eating more plant based is a way to speak with your dollar and provides a simple way to help the environment. Or even just buying products that are cruelty free, are ways to make small impactful changes."
