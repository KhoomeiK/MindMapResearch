I feel ya. The older I get the more I realize that sometimes they actually have a legitimate reason, like they read it and meant to respond later and forget, are taking a day away from their phones, or sometimes they‚Äôre too depressed to answer but appreciate the message anyways. Or they‚Äôre not reaching out because of their anxiety. I think all of this is especially true with social distancing and the surreal reality we‚Äôre in. Keep reaching out. I know it can be hard to not feel like it‚Äôs personal though. 

I also wanted to say I‚Äôm sorry about your situation with your parents. I‚Äôve been really grateful this didn‚Äôt happen a few years ago when I lived at home. I know how much it sucks and doesn‚Äôt feel like it will end, but it will and someday you‚Äôll be free. 

With your free time I highly recommend doing something I wish I had done when I was your age, learn some basic therapy skills.

It was written for people who had a stressful childhood. 

I found this type of learning to change how I think extremely helpful, it‚Äôs called CBT. There are a lot of different types of therapy, not just talk therapy. Another example, some people find DBT really helpful for emotional regulation. It‚Äôs a good research rabbit hole to dive into when you‚Äôre ready, and there are a lot of self help resources if you can‚Äôt access a therapist. Best of luck!

TrollCoping,flllm2b,t1_flljdm4,1585262845.0,"Exactly, and you can give it to someone even if you don‚Äôt have symptoms. And it can take 14 days for symptoms to show up, if your body displays it with symptoms. And for some people, those symptoms are fatal. I live in NYC and there aren‚Äôt enough resources for everyone who has a severe case to live, doctors are having to decide. My heart goes out to them. 

So fucking stay inside. Use the time to do something you‚Äôve always wanted to do. Be a better person. Or just put your life on pause and relax.

It might not seem like a big deal, it didn‚Äôt to me a few weeks ago. But now I‚Äôm furloughed and the city is shut down and a lot of people are dying, here and around the entire world. It hasn‚Äôt even reached its peak here, and slowly it‚Äôs leaking into the rest of the country. With a broken healthcare system and greedy dysfunctional government. 

You may not care about suicide but hopefully you care about murdering a loved one or stranger. 

Another thing people aren‚Äôt talking about is even young people who get it and survive it can get permanent lung damage."
ehlersdanlos,flikpcy,t3_fp08pa,1585184590.0,"Also in the boat! I don‚Äôt think tuning it out is a bad thing, that‚Äôs actually a focus of a couple types of therapy, ACT & CBT which are considered good for dealing with chronic pain 


I‚Äôm definitely struggling with being able to tune it out! Currently indefinitely furloughed, can‚Äôt work from home. For a few days I‚Äôve been hyperfocusing on half of my jaw not feeling in the right place so I keep stretching it and making it worse, it‚Äôs a really bad cycle that I‚Äôm struggling to snap out of. 

I don‚Äôt have advice really. I guess smoking weed and making art helps me connect to the present moment more and the physical sensations outside of my body, maybe try something like that?"
therapy,fksake7,t3_fkb9cl,1584485789.0,"Are your parents the kind of parents who think you going to therapy would reflect poorly on them? That might be the real root of things. If they think you seeing a therapist is a failure, they need to understand that not letting you see a therapist is them failing you, because you aren‚Äôt failing them (or yourself) for needing one. 

In the meantime, look for self guided therapy workbooks online, free websites, etc

Best of luck! One day you‚Äôll move out, this will all be in the past. Just keep going and advocating for yourself until you get there"

Thanks for all of the effort you put into it!"
therapy,fkm7410,t1_fklsa06,1584322424.0,Telling her might help future people! She should ask if there‚Äôs anything you‚Äôve said just because your parent was in the room during the first session without them present
