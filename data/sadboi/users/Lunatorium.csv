youtubers,fqw98ca,t3_gla2xp,1589696553.0,I would suggest having looked at your Elgato HD online that a laptop might be alright for video capturing as the Elgato you have has a built in encoder so it'll take some strain off your laptop.

ukpolitics,fqa8xky,t1_fqa7dr9,1589214916.0,Thank you for that patronising post. I'm aware of uncertainty but this variance is ridiculously inaccurate to the point where the data might as well be made up. Welcome to A level reality.
ukpolitics,fq9o8nk,t1_fq9lbzg,1589203455.0,Every last bit of it. Their version of 'science' is just a horrible cobbled together mess of contradictions and uncontrollable variance.
ukpolitics,fq9me17,t1_fq94ixa,1589202200.0,This entire reply relies on confusing what you believe is true to be absolute fact. You don't know anything more about any of this than the rest of us. This is not only a ridiculous list of self-gratifying assumptions but is also by far and away the most sanctimonious and pompous reply I've received.

ukpolitics,fq8lgyd,t1_fq8k3h3,1589168997.0,"The problem is that the press conferences communicate everything very poorly. Science is usually the first casualty of the buzzword nonsense culture they've been feeding to the nation for weeks.

The R number is being commonly abused in a form that is exactly outside of every definition you used in your last reference.

You seem to confuse anomalous data with cogent decision making. The government have continuously chosen the worst decisions with continuously flawed data. How can I have any serious faith in that? 

Sleep well but don't be afraid to reply to this, I'll be here tomorrow with the same irritations."

ukpolitics,fq8j9cf,t1_fq8hlqe,1589167481.0,"I'll be honest, teaching piano lessons over Skype drives me mad! Besides the poorly tuned pianos, terrible cameras, horrible treble sound and help that suddenly takes 5 minutes compared to 10 seconds in person, please believe me when I say I'm so grateful to earn and continue to teach anything!

It feels like it's going to be permanent now but I can see a time sooner rather than later where this becomes a memory!

It's great to hear you compose as well. Good luck to your school and feel free to let me know if things are going alright for you!"
ukpolitics,fq8in5o,t1_fq8gnjz,1589167069.0,"Telling me that evidence and facts exist isn't enough. By all means, give me links to them and I'll happily study them myself.

The R number is a highly flawed ideology without context. Give me some context you're alluding to in this case and I'll happily come back to you with a response. 

The press conferences are not an impeccable source of knowledge. In fact, the press conferences are so adept at being vague, they are of little to no value scientifically. Seeing them cherry pick questions each day is also a continuing irritance. 

It seems like they're following the least incomplete of data which in itself is still wildly inaccurate. 

The nation's health (in all aspects) is a good place to start with decisions. A careful balance between the capitalism that keeps all economies going and the human cost seems to be all they are thinking about, mostly outside of the 'science' they profess to be following. Tonight's speech ignored both sides for the sake of neither side."
ukpolitics,fq8h7ro,t1_fq8gkjn,1589166125.0,"By the looks of things, they've simply added a few 'benefits' to the continuing lockdown (unlimited exercise, outdoor sports and sitting in parks).

The lockdown is still here in full but with caveats and a promise of potential benefits starting on June 1st."

You can exercise outdoors as much as you like.

I'm just happy to hear people are ok amongst this overarching mania!"
ukpolitics,fq8fwvw,t1_fq8f3dg,1589165293.0,Controlling the uncontrollable is something they like to pretend they can do! There are so many problems with every part of their guidance in any case. The address earlier just drove me mad!
ukpolitics,fq8fl4j,t1_fq8cxxc,1589165087.0,"Believe me, I've seen people in this area walk into oncoming traffic to avoid each other. I was having a rant earlier but underneath that irritation, I'm genuinely calm! 

What do you do for a living and are your family ok?"
ukpolitics,fq8eiw6,t1_fq8czxf,1589164402.0,"I'm my opinion, it was so non-committal that I agree with you! No government likes to accept blame for anything.

I think the whole situation is contributing to poor mental health! Including mine!"
ukpolitics,fq8e8cy,t1_fq8c148,1589164214.0,"The very idea of the R number is completely flawed at this point as it doesn't have a scrap of relatable context. 

The whole country was addressed tonight with the implicit fact that the nationwide R number was the defining factor whether further stage 2 or 3 progress would even become a reality. 

I don't want them to ignore any area that exceeds the ideal R number but I don't expect the whole nation to be under house quarantine for the sake of obvious parts of the UK being the most significant contributors.

Now we're supposedly in a position to control this outbreak better, why should we deliberately quarantine everyone when it has been said they can take direct action with the worst effected areas?

Second point: I haven't disregarded any official data; I simply believe it to be so subject to a huge amount of uncontrollable variables, it has to be called into question as to its accuracy.

Last point: I've watched all 49 of those daily press conferences and I've come to the conclusion they're absolutely flawed. They started with good intent but quickly descended into vague, sound bite voicing irrelevance. As much as they can't know what is coming, their current data is so subject to significant flaws, they can't know what has transpired either. Yet, they're basing an entire nations' response on this."
ukpolitics,fq8cy09,t1_fq8b94u,1589163379.0,"To those who think for themselves, this is an unending torture!"
ukpolitics,fq8cmoa,t1_fq8bfej,1589163179.0,"Another extremely reasonable response! Thank you!

I live in an area that swallows every phrase, tagline and mantra to such a degree that they'll walk into the road so they maintain their 2 metre distance (although the same science has stated that people moving that quickly need more than 2 metres of distancing!)

The worst part of this is the effect it's having on the people who take every single word as gospel and start to take it upon themselves to govern in the government's name. There are people who are more than happy to just sit back, get paid and watch the world burn around them. For people like me who lost 80% of their income overnight, I can't indulge in the same thought. 

I hate to say it but I see the 'loosening' tonight as nothing more than teaspoon shallow placation.

You seem to be very genuine though and I sincerely thank you for your reply! I hope for the best for all of us but I was in a particularly 'ranty' mood after watching that 15 minute farce."
ukpolitics,fq8bxpf,t1_fq8bmmw,1589162732.0,I can assure you she has no better answers to this than the rest of the UK. They are all following the 'science' and the clearly flawed science is failing them all. The entire UK is suffering from the same insanity due to do many extenuating circumstances and a very poorly administered overall response.
ukpolitics,fq8alp9,t1_fq89lld,1589161907.0,"My problem with the statement was the assumption that whilst magic 'R number' is a nationwide concern, they'll also crack down on certain areas that have a resurgence of cases that may or may not affect the overall R number. The R number sounds like a figure that could be a range of anything given the amount of conflicting variables at play. 

Plus, a range of anything is meaningless seeing as we've been kept in the dark about their processes and evaluations throughout the entire duration of the pandemic. I would also call their infection, recovery (that are not properly declared) and death numbers into serious question as the variables in play are so volatile.

Again, I emphasise that is solely a scientific concern to me and I'm absolutely aware of the horrendous human cost this has wrought. The inconsistencies throughout drive me mad."
ukpolitics,fq87ian,t1_fq7w7yk,1589160075.0,"My pleasure, I was astonished to have such a conversation at all!"
ukpolitics,fq87ccu,t1_fq7x3l1,1589159978.0,"Then I invite you to clearly define what areas 2 to 4 are and in particular, what a half version of each level is trying to convey as a message to the general public."
ukpolitics,fq82i4l,t1_fq7zujv,1589157167.0,"I would say that it has a great deal of bearing on this conversation, especially as it seems so out of place on a post such as this in a place I would never have expected such a specialist. But outside of this, I'll reiterate, I appreciate such a measured response!

While I don't technically agree with your angle, it is all cogent reasoning and I appreciate it all the same."
ukpolitics,fq7wzi8,t1_fq7w0q7,1589153924.0,"The correlation between the 5 tier system offered tonight and assuming a prior knowledge of the DEFCON system is overreaching a bit in my opinion. This was never implied by the announcement and having a vague area between 2 equally vague areas isn't helpful. This is especially true when an assumption needs to be in place that eludes to each level being equidistant in severity. Furthermore, isn't the DEFCON system subject to an aggressive threat to the country from human means rather than a faceless virus?

Again, I have to ask, are you just a knowledgeable lurker or do you have some insight into this kind of thing? 

I enjoyed the responses regardless."
ukpolitics,fq7u3fj,t1_fq7t9qk,1589152232.0,"A very sensible reply to what was a frustrated rant. However, I have to ask, where did you get the information for levels 2,3 and 4? To the average consumer, this comes over as meaningless.

As this was so utterly reasonable, I'll take your points onboard. This was just me very sarcastically venting my spleen.

What line of work are you in?"
ukpolitics,fq7tje8,t1_fq7sht8,1589151903.0,I don't! This was just an enraged sarcastic rant. Everything in-between 1 and 5 is anything anyone wants to be.

My channel is called the ""The Pixel Asylum"" and it covers gaming throughout my 40 years on this planet. I like to be sarcastic and dry with my approach and this video is a spoof review of 1986's OutRun."
Anxiety,fn2zd77,t3_fj2y1a,1586608589.0,"Seeing as I live in the UK and we're getting an absolute battering at the moment, I would like to bring something up about the way the death numbers worked and why I think they're so irresponsibly inflated.

The quote from the telegraph was that ""980 people died in the UK yesterday"" but this was contradicted by the description of how NHS England came to these numbers.

The total deaths in England on 9th April were nearer to 180 with the majority of the remaining deaths coming from April 1st - April 8th. Look again and you'll see 29 of them were reported from March!

These may be deaths that had not been picked up before and every death is a heartbreaking tragedy but this reporting is deliberately misleading and grossly sensationalised.

I hope that helps my fellow Englanders!

Edit: I hate spelling mistakes!"
Anxiety,fmnekgi,t1_fmmq2tb,1586224281.0,"I'm in the UK as well and even though we had a second daily drop in deaths, the health of the prime minister is extremely concerning. I'm sincerely terrified for the morale and mental state of the nation if we lose our prime minister to this.

Let's all be positive for some shred of good news on this regard tomorrow."
YouTubePromoter,fl2c7ti,t3_flxh68,1584747686.0,"You're always going to upset someone no matter how hard you try. Seeing as most tiered lists like this are your own opinion, tell them to go and jump off a cliff if they're being mean to you for no reason.

Seriously though, just ignore passing haters like this. It's not as if they're going to become subscribers is it? 🤣"
anosmia,fkjdej0,t3_epyib0,1584242736.0,"Pure and upfront honesty has always worked with me. We have a disability that very few people can even relate to, never mind understand. I always get the bewildered initial response to having no smell shortly followed by people trying to understand and adapt their response to your lack of smell. 

With my wife, I get her to test my breath at times. I'm a lucky man in this regard!"
anosmia,fkjcwpd,t1_fk2relq,1584242350.0,"This is where I would sound nearly insane to the average man... If I have a clean palette and haven't eaten in a while, I can taste stronger smells like smoke, bleach and sulphur. It isn't remotely accurate and it's more of a sense of something strong in the air but it's an oddity that's often hard to explain."
anosmia,fkjc0zp,t3_fad4em,1584241669.0,I'm a lifelong Anosmia sufferer and even I didn't know about this!
anosmia,fkjbjki,t3_f9kvxq,1584241296.0,I looked at your question and I thought I smelled a rat! Then it dawned on me I didn't :D
anosmia,fkjbgqk,t3_f9ksrk,1584241236.0,"I have sat in a workplace staff room eating my lunch exactly 1 foot away from a backed up stink that was sending customers running out of the door to the shop!

The only time it really bothers me is when I'm in a perfume shop and the coloured water on display is a waste of time with me."
anosmia,fkjb77l,t3_fa8zk8,1584241035.0,"As someone who has never had any concept of smell being a standard sense in life, I genuinely feel great empathy for people like yourself. Because you could smell at one point, you miss what you once had. In my case, I have no idea what a smell sense is like so besides my loved ones doing their best to explain what smell is, I have no real understanding of what I'm missing.

Feel free to chat with me anytime about this!"
anosmia,fkjan4e,t3_ffy8lo,1584240603.0,"It's a fun thing for 'normal' people to get their head around isn't it? I'm 40 now and I have never had a sense of smell since the day I was born.

Besides a doctor calling me a liar because I believed that I could taste fine, the medical side of things has been quite good to me. I have to admit that I have a near chronic salt addiction seeing as subtle food is generally a wasted taste test on me.

I first realised I couldn't smell was when I was on a family holiday at the age of 7 and my mum commented on the great smell of the bread in a local bakery. I said I didn't understand what she meant and it all started from there.

Since then, I've sat in staff rooms at work that have had blocked drains that kept the customers out of the shop, I sat next to a woman at college with such chronic hygiene problems that I couldn't understand why I was always alone with her and I slept in my bedroom that was 1 room away from an electric blanket that set one of my parent's beds on fire.

I consider myself lucky for 2 reasons. Firstly, I don't understand what I have no concept of in the first place, so besides a visit to the perfume shop every now and then for present ideas, I'm fine. Secondly, if you have to lose a sense, smell is the obvious choice in this regard.

If you want to talk about your broken sense, please feel free to speak to me whenever you wish. 

Take care!

Scott"
OP1users,fjk7rle,t3_fdwo5e,1583421884.0,"I can answer the update and samples questions. The update is done on the computer but it's really easy. When you plug it into a PC, it will open the OP-1 like any other storage device. Drop the firmware file into this and eject the disc. When you turn the OP-1 back on, it'll do the update for you.

Go to the website op1.fun for a million free samples you can use on this instrument. You can add a load of drum kits on there and up to 24 of your own samples as instruments (I may be slightly out with this amount).

Good luck!"
funny,fg56x1a,t1_fg550su,1580519783.0,Feel free to give me links to this special legislation we supposedly have. The influence of the EU is mainly French and German in nature. The EU cannot allow the UK to prosper independently as it erodes their very purpose of existence. I'm going to enjoy watching the newly converted re-joiners make a fool of themselves over the next few years.
funny,fg51bnr,t1_fg4sd2d,1580515862.0,Biased and partisan. How about a more balanced representation for those that don't live in the UK? How about you mention the £1.09 billion bill presented to the UK this evening? This country has never had influence with the EU hence the referendum in the first place!
memes,fbc66hq,t3_ecin4w,1576716620.0,"Ah the mirror, the paper of the raging, tyrannical and undemocratic hard left in the UK. This paper is the equivalent of communism for the easily swayed left wing fools in this country. They've got nothing to print now that their democracy blocking ways with brexit and their favourite political party have both been murdered in the last week :D"

anosmia,f38sp1d,t3_d9lt11,1570739545.0,"Freshly baked bread at the age of 7 when I walked past a bakery with my parents. When my mum commented on how nice the freshly baked bread was to smell, I just said I didn't understand what she meant. I was very lucky as my parents believed me very quickly."
anosmia,f38qk4r,t3_d92ztc,1570738921.0,Do you still need people to help you with this? I haven't had a sense of smell at any point in my 40 years of life so far!
