astrologyreadings,fpeowg9,t1_fpels31,1588551820.0,"Oh wow! 
I would describe myself as a very very emotional person, highly sensitive, with a big heart and good intentions always! I‚Äôm very introverted, unfortunately don‚Äôt really have a lot of friends, a broken family and terrible bad luck in love. I think I‚Äôm often seen as ‚Äûweird‚Äú because I don‚Äôt really open up as easily, I feel like I only click with people who are also a little bit weird/different. Though I‚Äôve been told that my weirdness might be because of my Aquarius ascendant. I have intense daydreamer syndrome. I overthink a lot.. im definitely more of a creative/emotional than a logical/rational person. 
I feel like I can‚Äôt really balance my emotions that well, it‚Äôs either hate or love and no inbetween.
Regarding relationships I have never had a long lasting one. Only been in 2 and those only lasted for a few months. I tend to idealize my partners and also give too much love too quickly which led me to always being walked over and taken advantage of. I gave up on the idea of ‚Äûtrue love‚Äú but deep inside of me I am still craving that deep soulmate bond. 
I am very in tune with my intuition, i often times sense things about people before they tell me. I also sense the energy as soon as i walk into a room. 
Sometimes I feel like I am an old person stuck in a young body because I don‚Äôt really enjoy the things other people my age are enjoying as it‚Äôs not giving me the fulfillment that I need. 
I can‚Äôt really think of anything else right now, but I hope that gave you a better picture!! :)"
ADHD,fpck739,t1_fpahsyx,1588503621.0,"Hello! I finally started taking it (30mg), and it's going well so far. The only side effect I have is that every time I take it my body temperature drops rapidly. Did you experience that too? I usually have a normal to high body temperature, and I always wear T-shirts at home. But with Elvanse my body is getting so cold, mainly my hands and feet, that I start freezing and I have to wear hoodies and wrap myself in multiple blankets (and still feel kinda cold ü•∂).

I totally get you though. I'm still kinda scared of the whole medication thing. The first time I took Elvanse, it was a good experience, but I still took like a 5 day break before taking it again. I was never really fond of pills in general. I even feel bad when taking pain killers so I rarely take them.

So, yesterday was the 2nd time I took Elvanse and today is the 3rd. So far so good.

I was incredibly scared of heart racing/palpitations, but surpringly Elvanse makes my heart rate go down actually. It's like it calms my whole body (including the anxiety).

I feel like my heart is beating faster when I'm **not** on it. I kinda woke up this night because I felt my heart beating fast? Idk if it was a coincidence because I'm so paranoid about it but the Elvanse was definitely already worn off by the time I felt this so it couldn't have been it. I don't know...

If we were to get back together, I think I would live in constant fear of him changing his mind and breaking up again. It would never be like it used to be. It's a really unhealthy constellation. And also, my mental health is much more important to me right now.

Thanks to your comment I made a doctors appointment and have had a couple appointments since then and yesterday I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease. I have a severe thyroid goiter with nodules and cysts in it, which luckily were tested to be benign. But, all the symptoms I've been having for all these years including my ADD symptoms, depression and anxiety etc. are apparently caused by Hashimoto's.

It would have probably taken me countless more years to finally get ahold of the underlying cause of all my symptoms if it wasn't for you.

Irgendwie erleichtert es mich dass es noch mehr Leute gibt denen es so geht, ich k√§mpfe schon seit so vielen Jahren damit dass mein Gehirn einfach ""komisch"" ist und am Anfang dachte ich ja dass es normal ist bzw. dass jeder diese Probleme hat oder dass ich vielleicht einfach verpeilt bin. Aber wenn ich meinen Freunden davon erz√§hle k√∂nnen die teilweise √ºberhaupt nicht nachvollziehen wie mein Gehirn funktioniert und da wird mir dann immer klar dass irgendwas nicht stimmt.

Klar w√§re das die absolute Katastrophe wenn uns dann der Psychiater sagen w√ºrde ""mit Ihnen ist alles in Ordnung"", aber ich glaube nicht, dass das passieren wird. Ich bin ziemlich sicher dass da irgendwas dahinter steckt. Und das eigene Gef√ºhl t√§uscht einen bei sowas ja nicht.. Wie lange warst du denn in Therapie bzw bist du es noch?

ADHD,fihgcwc,t3_f7xmic,1582410044.0,"Are you me?! I swear I am experiencing the exact same thing, the only difference is that I have no experience with meds but even my psychiatrist appointment is in July like yours. Until then I'm kinda just letting the days waste away.

The sad thing is that I started seeing a therapist for my ADHD symptoms 5 YEARS ago. Sadly she did not take me seriously because she didn't believe in ADHD. She was positive that my symptoms might stem from unresolved childhood trauma. I believed her (I was young and didn't know any better) and I was then diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder and went to therapy for 4 years. I am thankful for therapy because it made me grow and learn a lot about myself, but obviously it didn't change anything about the symptoms that made me seek help in the first place. If anything it has gotten even worse. Brain fog, lack of concentration and motivation, endless procrastinating, slow thought process, the list goes on. All these symptoms have always been there but they have now reached their ""peak"". I'm literally a chaotic mess. I could somehow make it through school, (it was a huge struggle), but now that im in university it just doesn't work anymore. I can't handle it anymore, I even dropped out of law school and changed my degree because I thought maybe I'm just too stupid for law but obviously it didn't help, I'm still struggling even with a different degree. I feel like my brain is a useless sponge. 

I often times think how different my life would have probably turned out if I just directly started seeing a psychiatrist instead of a therapist for my diagnosis. I pretty much could have been diagnosed 5 years earlier but oh well.

I wish I could give you some useful advice, but I don't have any since we're pretty much at the same exact point in our journey. I'm wishing you (us) the best of luck though, we can do this!!

I'm not a psychic, so all I can say is I understand you so well. I have experienced the same thing a few months ago, only difference is that we weren't together for such a long time as you guys. Everything was fine and then suddenly he turned weird, until one day he told me he wanted to end the relationship. It was so painful seeing him turn so cold from one day to the other. It hurt so bad. I fell into a deep state of depression after that and I still haven't recovered. I still think about it everyday. It felt like a part of me died when he left.

I hope you feel a bit better soon, it's gonna take time and it won't be easy, I know, but one day, it's gonna get better. Little by little. Put yourself first now. And don't be afraid to talk to a professional. And give yourself time to heal from those deep wounds. It's been almost 6 years, you have every right to grieve. Cry as much as you have too, and until you literally have ""no tears left to cry"". And after that, start working on yourself.

I do remember though that a few years ago a doctor had asked me out of the blue if I had any issues with my thyroid because apparently he noticed it while I was speaking.

lonely,f6s05vi,t1_f6rqat4,1573123793.0,"Yes. Sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve this. Why does finding a s/o come so naturally to a lot of people while it seems like the most impossible thing for me. At the same time, I do realize that there's a lot of people who are in unhealthy, toxic relationships so I guess I prefer being alone and lonely than constantly getting hurt by the person I love."
lonely,f6qqmca,t3_dsokd3,1573083449.0,"same, I relate so much. I've given up on the idea of ever finding true, genuine love. And I hate to say it because it sounds bitter and negative as fuck, but I've been disappointed so many times when it comes to love that I just give up. 

Anyway, im sending you a virtual hug. I feel lonely as fuck too, and in times like these it really feels like you're the only one in the world who feels this way, and its awful... but hey, at least we have this sub that shows us that there's so many more people who feel the same kind of emptiness inside :("
