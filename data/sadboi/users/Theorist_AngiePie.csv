I've faced a lot of hardships in my life including trauma and abuse. 

During one such major event where I quite literally died and came back, I had that strong epiphany. I don't understand why I had it in that moment but yeah. I was 13-14 ish here. 

The transition however wasn't that smooth obviously, mainly removing the guilt. I did a lot of reading and research on it till I was satisfied. I became an agnostic first, then a complete atheist.

Well, my friends don't quite understand depression. They think it as just being sad. I've been physically sick, depressed and suicidal my whole life and I had an abusive childhood. I'm a huge mess. For example if I tell them I resent my dad and it gets worse day by day, they tell me ""just don't pay attention to him"". If I tell them my illness makes me very suicidal, they scold me then say ""People have it worse"".
I know I have a lot of unresolved trauma that needs to be addressed by a professional. I can't get the help I need because of my parents who don't believe in depression or psychiatry.
Maybe it's just me but I just want someone to listen to me and just be there as a support. Give me validation I guess? Loneliness is the worst. I don't feel understood or loved. A small part of me likes to think that they care about me.
I do appreciate them putting up with me, my frequent emotional breakdowns are a lot to handle."
