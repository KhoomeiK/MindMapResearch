His boyfriend and I take literally hours to drink our coffee coz we like it room temp. My friend thinks we're crazy but he laughs. Theres something so much deeper wrong with OPs ex.

It had been two months since I had been in.

It went fine! For the first little while I was anxious and awkward but it calmed down, my brain switched to work mode and it was like I never left. I knew it would be fine but my anxiety was telling me otherwise. I still have a bit of residual anxiety left over from just how bad it was but honestly, it went ok. I hope it does everyone else!

But your comment reminded me of a thread I recently read on a queer intersectional feminist instagram account called Florence Given, I would HIGHLY recommend having a quick look. Its her most recent post, and also in her highlights. It was her asking how young women first explored or discovered their sexuality and the silly things we did to explore our sexuality and girl reading the answers was like THERAPY. it made me realize we all have done silly things because hormones, from dry jumping at sleepovers, to practising oral on friends,  to watching porn to anything in-between. Reading it all really made me realize we were all in the same horny and crazy boat, and we almost ALL have regrets from our early years that seemingly haunt ALL of us but it really shouldn't because, nobody else besides us remembers or cares."
