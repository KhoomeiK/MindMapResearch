I once read a passage that said we all wear three masks: one is what we show our peers, one is what we show family and friends and one is what we never show anyone but our selves.
I feel like I’m constantly showing the first two and I don’t know who I am anymore when the third claws at me comes out. Relationships are hard because I don’t know who would accept the mess I’ve become. I don’t need their disapproval and disappointment, and it’s a vicious cycle of friends and loved ones."
