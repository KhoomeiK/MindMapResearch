No it isn’t. Many democrats have some strange fantasy about how these things are and it’s not based on any fact. 

Questions about logistics need to be answered *before* anyone agrees to do it and that’s not happening. Supporting vote by mail is nothing more than virtue signaling until someone comes up with a plan for how it will work."
worldpolitics,fne7pmg,t1_fne5730,1586884522.0,"I don’t know whether or not voting by mail would fix anything, I’d like to see someone try it in some local elections for proof of concept. It’s naive to think it would be a flawless system. I’m not dismissing the idea, but your fantasy of rural America is far from reality. That’s really what I’m trying to address right now because I think it’s something people on the left refuse to look at closely. 

I live in southwest VA where there are hundreds of thousands of people who live without a vehicle because they can’t afford it. They don’t live in “the wild” (I rolled my eyes at that btw) they live in trailer parks.

 Your experience is not the universal experience. You living in rural Iowa does not invalidate anther person’s experience. 

There are probably 4 or 5 poling stations in my county that I’m aware of. Mine is 20 minutes away and I have a vehicle. People who live in town can walk, but they are not the majority. I’m not the most remote in my county by a long shot and the rest of SWVA is a lot like where I live. WV, NC, KY, TN are probably similar.

My first concern with voting by mail is the speed of it. Mail takes longer out here to begin with. My second concern is the capacity of mail services. How would an sudden influx of thousands, possibly millions of documents affect the system? Nobody is even trying to answer these questions before jumping on the vote by mail bandwagon. And who counts those votes? Last time I was there, 2 people at my county registrar are responsible for absentee and early voting."
