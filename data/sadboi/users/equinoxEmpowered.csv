In the video, the fella brings up how billionaires can write off these donations on their taxes. They also get to decide where the money goes, and there’s nothing stopping them from donating to things that directly benefit them or their friends, and still writing off the donation. 

There’s a lot of different kinds of charities, and some of them invest donations rather than using them to directly help the needy. A billionaire can donate to one of these foundations, that they own, and direct that the donation be used to invest in their own company. It’s little more than a bank account for them. 

All the while, there’s a huge amount of positive propaganda made for philanthropists. It betters their image and changes how people feel. 

As for the cost, billionaires represent a huge burden to an economy and workers. The sheer amount of effort and resources it takes to accumulate that much wealth in the hands of just one person isn’t something a human mind can fully quantify or ever hope to grasp. They can have more money than they can spend in a lifetime. They could lose the majority of their wealth and it wouldn’t impact their quality of life. 

Now I’m not remotely an expert in economics, but I understand the economy somewhat relies on there being a finite amount of wealth at any given moment. A robust economy probably has this wealth circulating quickly. I’d imagine having any significant portion of that wealth being stagnant won’t necessarily contribute to this circulation, especially if the amount of stagnant wealth represents a significant amount of the total available wealth. 

Additionally, the stipulations placed on donations can end up doing more harm than good, or have what amounts to a net 0 on their effectiveness. Bill gates is bent on eradicating polio, not minimizing the amount of cases. So efforts have to be shifted and goals have to be changed to address areas that have the smallest number of cases instead of the areas that need the most help."
