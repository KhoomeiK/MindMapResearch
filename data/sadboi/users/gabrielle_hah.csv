depression,erl5nex,t1_erl5cbx,1560978878.0,"Oh that's really interesting. Thank you so much for sharing that.

Maybe it's because of something in the past? Broken heart, bad experiences, bad people... That can leave people lock their love away from others, so they don't get hurt anymore.

I hope this didn't sound like I don't appreciate it, I do, i'm so glad that I even have friends and someone to talk to, even that means a lot to me. I'm a person who loves to spread their love, because I know a lot of people need it, however I know some people have the problem with expressing their emotions towards someone and then I appreciate every little thing I see from them. I'm just in a really bad place mentally, basically I just needed to vent somewhere, because I wasn't gonna vent to some of my friends, I know I might hurt them with it."

I struggle with feeling lonely SO much, like I can be surrounded by people that can say things like they love me etc but i would still feel lonely and I hate it. 

Everytime I have a moment like this in school, out with friends or basically anywhere I just sit there in silence and yeah, nobody does nothing, but I always try and tell myself that it's just because they don't wanna ruin the mood for everyone and maybe they'll talk about it with me later and that I shouldn't ruin the mood as well.
