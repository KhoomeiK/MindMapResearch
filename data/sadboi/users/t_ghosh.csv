The grocery store workers are very courteous and respectful. I salute these people who are working by taking such risks. I was given sanitary wipes at the entrance. I was able to wipe the handle of my cart and clean it. Most people were wearing gloves. All cash register people were using gloves. Sanitizers in front of credit card machine. Everything is being well managed. The store is completely full - Meat, fish, veggies, packed food, cookies, oil etc. I don't consider TP as a necessary stuff for surviving so.....

cringe,fharjw6,t3_f1tloo,1581424590.0,"I am going to save this post for ever. I read in the comments someone with adult onset flight anxiety. That's what happened to me this year.

I live in the US but my home is halfway round the world. Last year I flew 15 times. No problem. This year I was to go home in January.

I bought and canceled tickets three times before I realized I had suddenly developed terrible fear of flying. The Iran incident, and memories of turbulence in previous flights gripped me like hell. And I am an aviation nerd. I know quite a few things about flying. I simply could not get over my fear.

One Saturday, I just woke up bought a ticket and got on the plane. I tried to sleep the entire flight to London. Could not. The next 9 hr trip to Delhi was more of me struggling with not sleeping with terrible headache and fear. Over Poland the plane hit turbulence. I was crying like hell. Didn't make a peep but just sat with my head down and cried. The next 2 hour domestic flight was hell. It was kind of an older boeing 737 700 and I did not like the plane. Strangely this flight was the smoothest.

When I reached home, I found I did not have the courage to come back. Went to a doctor. Got diagnosed with anxiety disorder. Started medication and finally decided to fly back with my mother. Yes it was difficult again but I think being with mom and the medicines helped. I was probably more scared of the coronavirus. Our landing in Boston was strange. We saw the runway just seconds before landing. It was really cloudy. Gave a bit of scare.

I don't know if I have recovered. Waits to be seen. But flying for me will always going to be...... ""Let's hope this is not the end""... :)

P. S. I took a sleeping pill on my return flight from London. I actually slept for 4 hours. Great feeling."

Anxiety,fe6ah1s,t1_fe69v82,1578885458.0,"Thank you so much for your kind words. I will answer your questions.

I tried to find a therapist through my health insurance. Unfortunately I don't have a car. So I had trouble finding someone near me. This fear started very recently. Even two weeks ago I was completely OK. My first plane ticket was bought quite a few months ago. And I think the anxiety increased as the day got closer.

I called my mother and cried a lot. She was very sad too because she was expecting me to come. I told her I am feeling so helpless. I don't know why this is happening to me.

I think it's the traveling alone part. I don't have someone 's hand to hold. And the thought that there is no escape route. I am stuck in the tube. I never feel bad when I am traveling my train or boat. Never ever. I feel nice looking outside. It's the thought of being so high from the ground makes me very nervous. And then I am all alone inside. I have seen that when I fly with someone I am much more calm and composed.

I think calling my mom here and going with her is the only way I can even go home. I think I have to sacrifice my career for this. I plan to call my mother here and then probably later in the year I will go home.

I don't even know what to say to my colleagues, friends. What will I say? I am so so so coward I can't fly? I can't go home? My mind is torturing me? I am a defective person? What will I say."

I am a lay person. Sitting in the comfort of my living room. I am getting updates on Twitter that Iran is currently launching missiles from Iran into Baghdad. Like in real time.

And here I am an airlines. Passenger crew safety is my paramount importance. I just decide to fly through that region? What was ukraine airlines doing?? And move on to the other big ones -  qatar and emirates. They were at the very moment flying through Iraq and Iran. Basically it was like cruise missiles are literally flying below passenger aircrafts as they cruised at 30000 feet asl. Maybe its safe! Maybe its unsafe.. I mean why would you?? Isn't it common sense to not drive on the highway when there is a snow storm? Isn't it common sense to fly away from a thunderstorm or a hurricane? Then why NOT THIS? Does that mean these airlines flout rules for basic safety maintenance of aircrafts if they are willing to risk flying like this? 

Maybe 30000 Ft Asl is safe for aircrafts. What happens if the plane develops a mechanical problem and needs to land immediately? So now you are going to land in a war zone in the midst of cruise missiles flying around? 

I mean WTH.

I have decided in my life never to fly through that region. I trust robust airplanes and safe pilots / airlines. Not trigger happy war zones."
