I watched a few of his IG lives (could only take a few minutes at a time) and he is constantly deducing with his sausage fingers and looooves the attention those teens give him. These girls literally get together and tell them how much they love him. He asked one girl how old she was and she said ‚Äú16 but my friend here is 18‚Äù and he made a comment such as ‚Äúoh good‚Äù. No. Not good. Even if legal you are geriatric compared to them. Fat umpalumpa looking ass.

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong. I have to hide at times to have a meltdown. At home I am a mess, but work kind of keeps the stress and depression at bay. 
I may be wrong and it will all hit me in a few days or weeks. But for now, it is better for me to keep busy.
