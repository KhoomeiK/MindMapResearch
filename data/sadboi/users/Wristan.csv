roguetech,fpo8zvu,t3_gejwbp,1588780454.0,"For the Difficulty Scaling I've come to like Planet Rating over Company Rating. I forgot which video I watched, but he made a good point about the two. If you chose Company Rating every plants skull rating with adjust to met your company rating, so if something happened down the line and you wanted to run some 2-3 skull planet, but everything is now to your company rating and all planets are now 4 or 5 skulls, well your out of luck. 

I find it's a good way if your really taking a beating and need to restock gear for your mechs Planet Rating allows you to go to a planet that isn't as challenging. Also it feels more natural, with company rating it feels like the entire Clan/Inner sphere is taking it easy on you until you become a better Mercenary group, but if you prefer to use that Company setting that's fine. As I said, ""It just feel more natural"" to use Planet Rating in my opinion. 

I have Mission Control set to Randomized Spawns 1.3 map size: randomized spawns on maps 1.3x larger than in original BT game. Wanted a little larger map size then the default.

 I turn on all the Additional Flashpoints and Story stuff since I like more options to be able to run lots of different flashpoint. 

Era's Heroes I haven't really done much with, maybe down the road I'll touch on it. 

Era Units... I'm drawing a blank at this moment. I'll take a look what I selected and update on this one later. 

Pilot Randomizer I have I think the defualt(Random Ronin Starting Pilots: you will get random **Ronin** pilots ). I just know Ronin have the little purple icon on them, I assume they have some better traits and such, but my knowledge on it isn't great. 

Not sure if this helps, did my best to answer what I could."

I didn't need anything, but my god. Water was also hit hard. I did want to get a gallon of distilled water which I use for my Cpap machine. Why are people buying distilled water, it doesn't work well for drinking and makes you more thirsty, I drank some one time and it made me feel sick. 

I was checking out and talking to the cashier and he told me, ""I just restocked all the shelves at around midnight for toilet paper and such. At 7am it was all gone."" The store opens at 6am which means in an hour everyone and there hoarder bought everything out. Look Covid-19 is bad, but needing 200+ rolls of TP is BS. I don't care how many kids you have. It takes me like 3-5 days to use 1 mega roll of TP. Last I check the virus doesn't cause diarrhea.

If people would take down the average use of what they use and how long it last you should only need to keep a stock of 2 week tucked away in cause. So in my case 1 x 8 pack of the mega rolls would get me through two weeks. So 32-40 rolls should handle an overall family of 4 for 2 weeks. As for the hand sanitizer, what the hell are people doing with the stuff, bathing with it. Calm you're tits people. The human race has survived much more with less medical knowledge then we have today.

gaming,fk84l6m,t3_fgvkab,1583949249.0,"Man I love Chrono Trigger, I've lost track of how much I've played it over the years. I have every port of it that has come out. I never could get into Cross, every notion that it's the sequel or has anything to do with CT urks me. I think the combat was what really made me hate the game. As a kid I couldn't understand the spells and combat system as well as Chrono. Why did it seem so cryptic, I just want to cast a spell. 

Was MP too good for Cross? I mean why change a simple formula of this spell cost X MP to cast? I bought Cross, played it for about an hour and then took it back to Game Crazy for 75% of it original value for a different game. I wait for a true spiritual successor to Chrono Trigger, but I doubt I will ever see one in my life time. 

There seem to be many who like Cross and maybe I would've been less harsh on it if they did try and pass it off as a sequel or it has any connection to CT at all. I might get hate from people who enjoy CC, but this is my opinion. If you liked CC I'm glad you got something out of it, but I will always see it as a sequel that failed to live up to it protege."

Vent,fjh4v7a,t1_fjgjxeu,1583341276.0,"I'm glad that I was able to maybe help a bit. About the dream catchers, I have an older sister and she was always into paranormal, herbal medicine and stuff like that. She told me the best placement for a dream catcher was the wall directly closet to where my head was above the bed. Which again with my experience with them in my youth seemed to have work.

Not sure about multiples. Though another thing I was told by her is there's was something to do, but its been so long, that they do get full and you have to remove the negative dreams from the every so often. I don't really question my sister in these matters. I got laryngitis once and was unable to speak at all. 

She was able to use this book she had and whipped this weird herbal medication drink together and within 1 hour I was able to speak at about half my normal voice. Within the next two days it was all gone. I have no idea what was in that drink, I swear at first I thought she was trying to kill me haha. 

I can understand not wanting to confess your feelings due to rejection, that's probably my weakest area of knowledge and experience. I never tried dating or anything. I think I was traumatized at a very young age, middle school and my weight didn't help either. 

I had a crush on someone around when I was 10-ish? My sister and her BF were going to get on a plane, but got trapped in the elevator. The person who I had a crush on ending up dying on that plane flight. So I can understand the dreams of loss, it hit me hard for a while. It was maybe puppy love, but it truthfully was that one and only time I can honestly say I had a crush.

Life is short and you never know what will happen with each passing day. I hope everything will work out for you and that the dreams will taper off. Cherish those you love around you <3"
Vent,fjg1jbf,t3_fd8ypj,1583307491.0,"I've had something like that. It probably won't be the same, but maybe some similarities. I had a lot of stress from my old job and would also have dreams of what would be waiting for me tomorrow. I had 3 different type, one of which the events of the day went almost as it went in dream, two terrifying dread of a job I wasn't looking forward too, or 3 really weird stuff, but it was almost everyday. 

10+ years of this, due to circumstances I no longer have that job, but every since I stopped working there all the dreams went away. I think the majority was caused by stress and fear of doing things I dreaded. 

I don't know if something in you life maybe doing the same and it triggering these nightmares. I'm not a professional in dreams, but I always found a good majority seem to be tied to events that are/have happened in my life and get twisted in my rem sleep to either pleasant, weird, or terrifying. Now this may sound farfetched, but maybe try a dream catcher. When I was younger I had a lot of nightmares that would always wake me up at night.

When I was in middle school one of my classes made dream catchers and when I got home I hung it up. I rarely had any sort of nightmare since doing so. I stopped using it as I got older since I seem to no longer be having nightmares. Maybe it was the fact that know the dream catcher was there put my mind at ease and helped alleviate some of the stress from school? The mind is a complex part of us and it hard to pin down what is the possible root cause of nightmares.

I wish I could help more, but maybe you can have a little bit of a takeaway from the information above. Oh, sweets, anything sweet before bed is usually bad. If I eat anything like this close to going to bed my brain goes full on house of horrors on me."
Vent,fjg0dfi,t3_fd7hxt,1583306195.0,"I had a friend like this and no matter what advice I gave to them it they did no heed any of it. Listening to this over ten years on and on about, ""How everything is terrible and I'm so depressed."" I finally told them, ""Look, I hate to break it to you, but I have my own issues. I've tried for 10 years to give you the best advice I can, but you're beyond my ability to help."" I never broke off the friendship mainly due to not having very few friends, but we've only briefly made little exchanges over steam.

I mean little. Over the last two years we only checked if basically we were still alive. To be honest not having to support all that toxic complaining from them took a massive burden off me. In fact Jaiden Animation on Youtube touch on the topics of red flags and toxic friends. The video title is, ""Things about Relationships I wish someone told me about."" It's a decent video and I agree with a lot of it points. My friendship with this toxic friend wasn't always bad, but I say once we both crossed the 30's mark it was never-ending, ""Woe is me."" 

Personally if you have limited number of friends you don't want to lose what friends you do have, but if someone doesn't want to change, listen to you or others, well its best to cut them off. I hope you can figure things out and it gets better, but it's only going to get harder the longer you wait."

AskReddit,fizhahf,t3_fafy7i,1582862803.0,"Only once, I had bought a used CPU(Intel) off Ebay and it initially worked, but the MB I had; had some issues. Personally that MB had been the bane of problems, but I was trying to help a friend out to upgrade to something better then what he had. I took the CPU out a few times as there was a few bent pins. As stated above I did eventually get it to post, but couldn't get two ram slots to work so I wasn't able to use dual channel.

Went back and forth, trying to see if I could get the other channels to read my ram. I never dropped the CPU, but I failed to notice damage that accrued at one point. Now I wasn't trying to scam anyone, everything was my fault even though I'm still not sure how the wafer on CPU got damage. So I contacted the seller and informed them it had stopped working and sent it back. He had better equipment to zoom in on the wafers and it's dinged.

Before he got back to me he posted about it on Reddit asking how this could happen and honestly I wasn't even made, I found the whole thing funny. I was out the money, but I learned and got me some head gear so in the future I can inspect possible damage myself. We both were chill about the whole thing and I even told them I found their Reddit post and they found that funny as well. 

I knew I messed up somehow, since one, it worked before hand and yeah it could've failed at some point, but felt unlikely. They had pictures of everything before shipping it out and after I sent it back saw the side by side. If the wafer was damaged I don't think it would've posted at all, but all in all I was more sad that I was unable to surprise my friend with this upgrade. Personally this was the first time I ever caused CPU damage and I wish I knew the cause.

I like to saw something got jammed in the socket when I was securing it at some point. It happens and I could be like some people and keep insisting or man up and use the experience for avoiding this from happening in the future."
