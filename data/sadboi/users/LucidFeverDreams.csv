He shouldn’t have even allowed that. So basically what I’m trying to say, is it doesn’t matter if they slept together or not, it matters that that even happened in the first place. Please end things with this guy"

I have attempted to be in a relationship with some of these friends, but it hasn’t worked out. From my experience, this seems to be because people who smoke weed every day generally seem to use weed in order to self medicate somehow. Could be anxiety, depression, anything mental health related. You need to remember that people who do weed every day or extremely often are not doing it for fun, and are more likely doing it to self medicate something."

You seem to be taking on the role of a counsellor for her when your job should be to just be her partner. She seems to be very affected by her mental issues and doesn’t seem to have the drive to change anything, and unfortunately that drive has to come from her and her only. You can put ideas into a person’s mind, but you can’t make them do anything. I think you should go your separate ways if this whole punctuality thing really bothers you that much."

It’s really dumb that he slept at her place considering he’s had sex with her before, that’s a very normal thing to be upset about. Plus he did acid which you asked him not to do. So basically he’s dumb move on"
MafiaMystery,fk8mogh,t3_fgjkfe,1583958964.0,It’s really dumb how only people with godfather pro can use it. It just doesn’t make sense. All roles in mafia should be available to everyone.

But, I don’t think him just hanging out with a female coworker is a bad thing, I think it’s just normal. What he told you seems plausible"
relationship_advice,fk3o30r,t3_fgckle,1583841302.0,"I think it’s a valid reason to be scared of her cheating when she goes off to college, because unfortunately that’s what most people do when they go to college, they experiment. But also, with that said, it’s actually very normal to lust after other people when in a relationship. It’s just that no one should really talk about it with their partner because it makes things uncomfortable, it’s the sort of thing couples usually keep to themselves. So it’s probably not good on her part that she said that to you."

I understand that you’re married to this man and you probably love him, but I would genuinely suggest getting a divorce after this. Not only is it creepy that he’s watching porn made by his student, it’s also crossing a LOT of boundaries with you. This tells me that he may not respect you as much as he should. Like for real, if I could I would slap him for you. What kinda person pulls this shit. Again, I’m so sorry"
relationship_advice,fjw6kjm,t3_ff67ze,1583636000.0,You seem to be really putting men into a box and stereotyping them. You’re lucky you have someone around who will work on a computer for a whole hour just so you can use it. Please re-evaluate your outlook on men :)

Like I think you should think about some other possibilities first. Maybe they just have conversations that are private and she doesn’t wanna talk to you about it? Who knows. But if you’re 100 percent sure (or at least 99 percent sure) that it’s incest, you should confront them about it. It will be extremely uncomfortable but you should if you feel that strongly about it"

relationship_advice,fjk40b3,t3_fdw6yd,1583419537.0,"I totally understand why you have these fears, I have been in a similar situation before so trust issues can be very real. However, you need to recognize that you have a very good marriage with wonderful children now, and what happened was ages ago. I know it’s much easier said than done, but you gotta let go and move on. He clearly seems devoted to you."
relationship_advice,fjk3sk5,t3_fdw338,1583419396.0,"This is a tough one, because a wedding involves your feelings and her feelings equally. I don’t think you should invite them, because if you do she will likely not have happy memories of her wedding and she’d probably be upset. I understand that you want your friends at your wedding, but what’s more important, having a good wedding or having your friends there?"
relationship_advice,fjk3lzs,t3_fdw4kr,1583419278.0,"Normally I would say to tell her because that’s the right thing to do, but for now I would say not to because their relationship seems to be going well. If he tries to cheat on her again, though, you should tell her. It’s the right thing to do, no one likes being kept in the dark"
relationship_advice,fjk3fp4,t3_fdvzlj,1583419166.0,It seems like she is trying to get your attention again. You may want to straight up ask her if she’s into you or not because she’s being very confusing lol. Maybe she just wants something small and doesn’t want anything big so she’s scared? Idk
relationship_advice,fjk34di,t3_fdw0d6,1583418956.0,"I am a girl so I am qualified to give advice here on what she may want lol. If it’s a fairy tale type thing she’s looking for, you gotta go all out. For example, hire a horse and carriage to take her out to an expensive restaurant.

relationship_advice,fjf3iam,t3_fd4st8,1583283522.0,"I think you’re really missing the point of why she wants to talk to you. I doubt she would just want to talk to rehash old bad things; she likely wants to make amends, apologize, or even explain things. Please give her the chance to do that because it’s probably eating her up inside."
relationship_advice,fjf1nfg,t3_fd4blg,1583282391.0,"Your girlfriend is an idiot and you should break up with her. Even if there’s nothing going on between them, why the hell would she go to prom and sleep in the same bed as her ex? That’s just totally wrong to do no matter what when you’re in a relationship.

relationship_advice,fjf12cx,t3_fd4iiy,1583282037.0,"I’m sorry but there is a very obvious answer to your question and I’m not sure how you’re not seeing it. Please don’t let him near your child, if he was abusive to you he could be abusive to the child too."
relationship_advice,fjeyb24,t3_fd459c,1583280467.0,"I’m happy that you told him to step back, because him saying that she looks hot and sexy is just weird to say to you. No one in a relationship should be talking openly about other people that way. I wouldn’t necessarily worry about the birthday present thing, though, ‘cause friends get eachother things for their birthdays too. With that said, be cautious still."
relationship_advice,fjdg5wp,t3_fcwxwg,1583252406.0,It sounds to me like you definetely made the right call. A guy who doesn’t respect your valid wishes doesn’t deserve you. I hope you find someone much better than him

I said “do NOT” because I was simply trying to get my point across. I wasn’t being judgemental at all, I was simply giving her advice because she’s literally on here asking for advice. Calm down plz. I think this is more of a you problem than a me problem. And again, you seem to be ignoring the fact that still a lot of people feel jealousy too lol."

relationship_advice,fjb2u2j,t3_fcjcfx,1583185387.0,"So yes, I do agree with you that this is not the best situation. But at the same time, you sound like you’re being very harsh on your friend. It’s not dramatic of her to say that she just can’t stop liking him, because that’s the truth. You also sound like you’re pushing yourself into the situation more than you should. I understand that you’re concerned, but I have a feeling that she needs to handle this one on her own for the most part"
relationship_advice,fjb2d7o,t3_fcjdp0,1583185135.0,"Do NOT open up the relationship. It may seem like a tempting idea at first, but 90 percent of the time open relationships end in major jealousy and heartbreak issues. I wouldn’t risk your relationship like that if I were you. And Uhm, I hate to break it to you but...if you truly were happy and satisfied with your current partner, you wouldn’t be having urges to be with a girl. I’m very experienced in relationships and I am also bisexual, so I am qualified to give my advice on this btw."

relationship_advice,fjb0l7h,t1_fjb0b1v,1583184153.0,"Like I said, it’s not wrong LEGALLY. Sometimes laws just don’t match up with general morals. And it’s not entirely impossible that he could have good intentions, but it’s VERY rare that an older man dating a younger girl like that actually has good intentions. Our priority here should be keeping this girl safe, not being like gO AhEaD GiVe It A TrY. Besides, believe it or not, 27 is different than 30. 30 is a whole 3 years difference and that can be huge."
relationship_advice,fjazib3,t1_fjaz1cx,1583183567.0,"It’s not LEGALLY wrong, but it’s morally wrong. The details don’t really matter in this situation, if an older guy is looking to date a girl that young clearly there’s something wrong. If she was 30 and he was 40, sure that would be fine because they’re both experienced adults and relatively in the same stage of life. However, an 18 year old is definetely not in the same life stage as a 30 year old mentally, so the fact that this guy is trying to get a girl who’s totally not his age at all is weird."
relationship_advice,fjaz67b,t3_fciycf,1583183385.0,"I’m really sorry this happened man...this doesn’t sound like it was your fault at all. I think you’re both just victims of her poor mental health currently. Just bad luck I guess. Maybe in the future you guys could try things again, but for now it sounds like she needs to focus on getting herself better. As rushed as this sounds, you should try to go on dates and have fun. I know you feel like no one could ever replace her, which is actually true; because no one can replace anyone on this earth. We are all unique. Don’t look for a replacement, look for someone who makes you happy."

relationship_advice,fjay66u,t3_fciu1w,1583182846.0,"So, I understand that you want to experience things, but this is not the kind of thing you really want to experience. To be brutally honest with you, most older men who go after 18 year olds are simply looking for something surface-level, like your body for example. I would be extremely careful about meeting this guy if you don’t know him well. Your parents have the right to be freaking out about this and honestly they should be freaked out."

relationship_advice,fj853ti,t3_fc2opz,1583105344.0,I think you might be overreacting a bit. As long as she’s still having sex with you I don’t see what the issue is. It’s not like you’re being totally replaced by the vibrator

relationship_advice,fj7tk72,t3_fc0pc5,1583097997.0,"Ah, I see. If the fighting/lying is a 2-way street, I don’t really think either of you are to blame. Sometimes when people fight with someone they just end up saying awful things to eachother simply because they feel hurt and it becomes senseless after a while. Unfortunately, when things get to that point in a relationship, a break is definetely called for. I would also recommend to not shout or fight in front of the dog anymore...because the dog is a puppy, you may actually be giving it PTSD of some sort. It’s mind is still developing, so just be extra careful with that in the future. Also please ignore all these other comments saying that you’re a psycho or whatever, they just don’t understand the emotional impact of what you’re going through. Although it does seem like you may need a therapist to talk to."

Did you possibly do anything to provoke it?? Aside from the dog, I think your girlfriend needs to be a lot more caring. Now, I don’t know what you’ve said towards her at all, but I do know that her saying she hates you is just too far. Even if she was apologetic afterwards, that’s just not OK to say. Also, the fact that she wouldn’t take you seriously when going to the hospital just sounds really stupid. I think you guys should at least take a break for a while."
relationship_advice,fj7ramx,t3_fc0i34,1583096566.0,"Your boyfriend needs to have a BIG reality check. Pardon my French, but this guy can go fuck himself for all I care.

Also, I think it was a really shitty thing of her to just bring her boyfriend along on that night out, considering you specifically said you didn’t want to know any details and seeing them together would’ve probably been hard on you. So no, you’re not in the wrong. I personally wouldn’t try to gain your friendship back with her because she seems like an idiot lol. She’s not worth it"

It’s a common thing and it’s never fun, especially not for first relationships. Trust me, when you look at the whole rest of your life you have ahead of you, she’s just a small blip within it. You may not believe that now, but I hope you do in the future. Good luck man❤️ practice self care and do things to distract yourself"

If he truly wanted to only focus on you and your family together he wouldn’t be going for another girl or even TALKING about doing that. He wouldn’t even be showing SIGNS of doing that. You and your kids deserve a lot better treatment than how he’s been treating you. I know my advice may seem a tad harsh, but that’s just my opinion. As for the guy you have a crush on, do NOT go for him until you and your boyfriend have broken up. That won’t turn into anything good if you go for him currently. This is one of those situations where you have to think with your head and not your heart. Logic over feelings."

relationship_advice,fj6gq88,t1_fj5o9or,1583071401.0,"I don’t think you should call off the engagement unless one of you wants to during that period of time. That’s a big thing that you should probably leave open-ended for the time being. And I personally think it’s stupid that she’s not giving you closure with the amount of time the break is lasting, so yah you guys should discuss that. If she’s no willing to discuss it that’s a problem"
relationship_advice,fj5nnhu,t3_fbovac,1583037386.0,"First of all, kudos to you for typing this all out because this must’ve taken forever lol. Also, in my opinion; I think you guys should take a break for like, a year. I know that may sound like an awful idea right now but hear me out: a whole year apart is SURE to clear the air and allow her to figure out what she wants. Maybe a year is too long, maybe 6 months would work too? My point is, take a break for an extended amount of time. If she truly wants to be with you, she’ll come back to you. :)"
relationship_advice,fj5n8o8,t3_fbovd5,1583037062.0,"I feel like the whole ‘meeting the parents’ thing gets blown out of proportion a lot. Meeting parents isn’t a big deal, it just shows that your boyfriend wants you to be a part of his life and that’s normal. Examples of what would NOT be normal are proposing to you, asking you to move in together, etc. But meeting the parents, at least in my opinion, is a very small thing."
relationship_advice,fj51prr,t3_fblr9w,1583022118.0,"I think this guy is stupid for not supporting you. Nude art is beautiful, and it’s not like you’re the one that’s nude in the art; so he shouldn’t have a problem with it."
relationship_advice,fj2c6ye,t3_fb01ol,1582939917.0,"Honestly, I think your boyfriend is a dick lol. From what I see here it sounds like he’s the kind of person to get a circumcision just to prove a point. I think he needs therapy and he also needs to learn how to respect you better"
relationship_advice,fj2962w,t3_faywpx,1582937705.0,"First of all, don’t get too egotistical here. Experience is worth nothing if you can’t back it up with the hard work currently. But, with that said, I think your girlfriend is being a bit ridiculous lol. She can’t just have half of your company for working more hours. You should explain that to her. Plus if she signed the contract there’s nothing she can really do about that anyways"
relationship_advice,fiu4xgp,t3_f9vw9m,1582735210.0,"I understand why you would feel uncomfortable with that information. I would suggest asking more about it. Maybe he just needed relief and that was the only place he could get that. But, if he’s actually thinking about kids while masturbating I would 100% break up with him. That’s creepy"
relationship_advice,fishcon,t1_firfd0x,1582684844.0,"Man, I’m so sorry :( I wish you luck, I wish I could help more. I’m sure everything will turn out as it should for the good of your heart"
relationship_advice,firexn8,t3_f9fnmf,1582663095.0,"It’s not wrong of you to expect her to communicate in a healthy way, because that’s how relationships are supposed to work. Unfortunately, though, it seems she has some insecurities. I feel bad for her because it seems like she hasn’t dealt with possible past traumas, insecurities, etc. She should maybe see a therapist."
relationship_advice,fir8cuq,t3_f9fph2,1582659392.0,"This guy sounds immature to me. I understand that some people don’t like breast implants, face lifts, etc; but he shouldn’t be judging you for it. I mean you got it 2 years ago, it’s not like you knew him and that he didn’t like breast implants lol. You did nothing wrong"
creepyasterisks,fgtlmz8,t3_f0c4z7,1581106188.0,This is disturbing
AskReddit,ffanut9,t3_esc8vq,1579740338.0,"Uh, more like what I would say, not do. The amount of advice I would give my younger self in the span of 24 hours is MASSIVE. And first things first is gonna be advice on how to avoid being annoying"
dankmemes,ff7wj7x,t3_erxzoe,1579660043.0,"Why is this here, like sure it’s sort of in meme format but this is actually pretty disturbing...this is the kind of shit I’ll be thinking about all day"

relationship_advice,ff4tfga,t1_fetqfsc,1579572019.0,Let me know how it turns out! :)
relationship_advice,fetmacz,t3_eqkzwe,1579376826.0,"It’s completely understandable to feel sad or jealous over this. We’re human and we have problems with jealousy sometimes and it’s totally normal. As for how to fix the situation, I would suggest simply talking to your friends in a group chat or individually telling them how you feel and asking why they haven’t been inviting you out. It’s no good bottling your feelings in and not saying anything, you’ll just get more emotional and explode on them sooner or later. Good luck :)"
relationship_advice,fetjphx,t3_eql19u,1579376107.0,"First of all, you may already know this but I feel like I have to say that you dug yourself into a hole when you got all pissed off with her when she wasn’t responding. For future reference; if someone isn’t replying, even if they’ve been acting differently, only text once and no more. She probably meant what she said when she told you she was sick and needed space/time alone. But anyways, back to the matter at hand. Maybe she wants to start something or maybe she just wants to be friends, it’s difficult to tell from my perspective, but just go with the flow and see how things turn out. Don’t set your expectations too high and just chill out :)"
relationship_advice,fes9jra,t3_eqhwsx,1579362905.0,"It really depends on the type of girl she is. If she’s the type who will get freaked out but will think through things logically, you’ll probably be fine. Unfortunately if she’s the type to get scared of commitment and immediately run off, you’re kinda screwed. :("
