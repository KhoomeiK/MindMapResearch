Diablo,fqppxu1,t3_gjd5oi,1589551758.0,"I'm playing Diablo 2 for the first time too; started yesterday. Feels like a great game. I like how your hits have some real punch to them. I played Grim Dawn earlier this year, and it was a major disappointment because combat felt so stiff and feedbackless in it. No punchy sounds when hitting enemies, no proper gore. It was just boring because of that. I feel that you need to have impactful-feeling combat in an ARPG, or the game is an instant failure. Nothing can salvage that.

The graphics aren't bad in D2, either. Pretty good 2D, nice sprites. Good atmosphere. It also feels simple in a good way compared to some more recent games in the genre. So far the loot isn't overly abundant, and the stats are nice and simple. I can see myself playing this game a lot. Doesn't feel outdated whatsoever.

EDIT: almost forgot one thing: the game has SHIELD BLOCK ANIMATIONS and a satisfying clink sound to accompany them. That's a great detail. Why don't more games do this? A shield should be actually used for blocking, not just provide a lame stat boost."

Of course it's determined by prior causes because your choices must be based on prior events, or prior neural configurations. Whatever you do is based upon your own history and genes. At no point in life does anyone make a choice that isn't a function of a previous state of their character which isn't a function of a previous state of their character which isn't.... you get the point. 

Determinism is not exactly fatalism because fatalism suggests that you resign to your fate, and thus your fate becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Determinism means that you make choices and in a sense impact where you end up, it's just that those choices were the only options you ever really had. If you live with a fatalistic mindset, ""I can't impact my destiny"", that in itself impacts how you behave in a massive way. If, however, you just recognize that you're a product of cause and effect and continue living normally—as if you had free will, as you inevitably will—then that isn't a problem whatsoever. 

You DO make choices; you just aren't some magical god that creates outputs without inputs, or a soul ""compartment"" of the person that is above all external influence. If this were true, then you have the problem ""and why is my soul the way it is?"""

The narrowness of it makes it very convenient for conquest and defending your lands, as you mostly only have to worry about two directions, left and right, rather than 360 degrees. The campaign AI in Shogun 2 is also very aggressive, and you'll often see one faction take over half of the island, and quite quickly, which isn't really the case in any other TW game. I like this aggressive AI that doesn't just sit around.

philosophy,fk1tgch,t1_fk1rxt6,1583786523.0,"Fair and interesting points. The main problem is that our ability to affect our own behavior is limited. There are so many ""system one"", unconscious, processes that affect the formation of the self and one's behavior that it's not even realistic to hope to be in complete conscious control of oneself and keep a consistent self. 

These processes are programmed into us by evolution and are thus very deep-seated and largely beyond conscious control. One such example would be the chameleon effect. https://acmelab.yale.edu/sites/default/files/1999_the_chameleon_effect.pdf

Then there's there are the Stanford prison experiment and Milgram shock experiment that show how easily regular, upstanding people transgress into immorality when commanded by an authority. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment

Regarding authenticity, the reason I say that each individual ""version"" of your self is authentic is because this process of conforming is such a natural phenomenon. It would, on the contrary, feel inauthentic and forced to consciously try to maintain some kind of static, consistent self. 

The looking-glass self theory in fact suggests that your conception of your self is entirely dependent on how you think others perceive you: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking-glass_self"

Stoicism urges you to really carefully consider your aims and desiring what it worth desiring, not to be buffeted about by this and that. Be reasonable about your desires; don't lose control of your emotions. Here are a couple of relevant quotes by Epictetus:

>After you have contemplated all these possibilities—mindful of all the things that might happen and their consequences—and if your resolve is still strong, then exercise your judgment. If the overall picture still seems beneficial, then do enter the Games—wholeheartedly. By considering the big picture, you distinguish yourself from the mere dabbler, the person who plays at things as long as they feel comfortable or interesting. This is not noble. Think things through and fully commit! Otherwise, you will be like a child who sometimes pretends he or she is a wrestler, sometimes a soldier, sometimes a musician, sometimes an actor in a tragedy. Unless we fully give ourselves over to our endeavors, we are hollow, superficial people and we never develop our natural gifts. We’ve all known people who, like monkeys, mimic whatever seems novel and flashy at the moment. But then their enthusiasm and efforts wane; they drop their projects as soon as they become too familiar or demanding.

and also:

>Think of your life as if it were a banquet where you would behave graciously. When dishes are passed to you, extend your hand and help yourself to a moderate portion. If a dish should pass you by, enjoy what is already on your plate. Or if the dish hasn’t been passed to you yet, patiently wait your turn. Carry over this same attitude of polite restraint and gratitude to your children, spouse, career, and finances. There is no need to yearn, envy, and grab. You will get your rightful portion when it is your time. Diogenes and Heraclitus were impeccable models of living by such principles rather than by raw impulses.

Yes, because there really is no such thing as an ""authentic self"" as a static entity. The self is malleable, constantly conforming to the environment. You can easily see this if you look at a friend of yours that you know really well. They might be completely different in someone else's company (who is different from you), to the point that you question their authenticity in your company. Both of these selves of the friend in question are equally authentic. This is what facilitates social cohesion.

You can also easily see these shifts in yourself. The fascinating thing is that this process of adaptation is rather automatic. You don't consciously build your self to fit various situations and groups; it mostly just happens."

I've tried to improve myself according to some of those Stoic principles that I found profound, but I have to admit that my tolerance for the stupidity of others still has a long way to go. I still regularly lash out at people even though I know I shouldn't. I'm even a determinist—which naturally goes together with Stoicism, by the way—and understand that ultimately it's not their own fault, and yet I fail at controlling myself.

Okay, you can come back to me when the game comes out, and what was shown in the alpha exists in the game in an almost unchanged form.

>Ok shoot go and make something baldurs gate appropriate art style wise... You're going to end up with high fantasy which this is... I don't understand I'm sorry maybe another example of what you wished this would look like?

First of all, make it more muted and less colorful, less bright. That's a good start.

""High fantasy"" is a broad category that permits a lot of variance within it. There is not just one style that's called ""high fantasy"". It's a descriptor of content rather than a style of art."

I saw enough to largely determine that the visual look of the game has almost nothing in common with the previous titles. It's expected that the style seen in the footage will remain fairly consistent in the rest of the game. That is simple logic and extrapolation: you won't see a Western style RPG suddenly switch to anime out of nowhere, as an extreme example to make a point."

So they're showcasing a fake, D:OS2-based, version of the game? They wouldn't construct a demo that gives people an impression of the game, only to completely subvert it later. That would generate yet another controversy, this time from the crowd that was into that demo. That's not even remotely plausible.

> Explain art direction to me. Because with everyone I talked to art def wasn't what came up at all.

Art direction has to do with the overarching visual style of the game. Think for example anime, cel-shaded (like Borderlands), cartoony (like Fortnite or Cuphead), and so on. It sets the overall vibe for the game. Baldur's Gate had a rather dark and gritty look, quite unlike the one we saw in the reveal, hence the controversy!

> It's pre alpha. PRE alpha how do you not see how weird it is to not wait for actual stuff to be released? The old baldurs gate is 20 years old. It's nothing alike and you can't bring something back and just make it shiny again that's not how game development works.

No sane person actually expected the game to be isometric ""2.5D"", like the original games. That wouldn't be reasonable. However, that doesn't mean you can't have a similar atmosphere and art direction, even if you switch to 3D graphics.

It's alpha, yes, but like I said, the art direction won't be changing."
BaldursGate3,fjd3nuz,t1_fjd2ptz,1583244874.0,"> while everything is still placeholders essentially.

Well, you see, when you see high quality assets such as these in an alpha preview, they are *not* just placeholders. I don't know if you've ever followed alphas of games, but things like this seldom if ever change. It would be financial insanity to undo all this high quality work at this point (except the janky cutscenes and UI). I've followed many alphas to release, and every time someone says ""there are placeholders"" and ""things subject to change"", it's always a borderline lie and/or ignorance. 

Either way, it's mainly the art direction that people are complaining about, and that is something that is definitely not going to be turned upside down this far into development. It would be an unrealistic expectation. So you can pretty much treat what you see as final, or 98% final. 

The issue stems from the preview using just about everything from Divinity: Original Sin 2. The game palpably has a Divinity 2 atmosphere, which many BG fans are not understandably happy about. What do you think CoD fans would do if their game's identity was suddenly swapped to Battlefield? This outrage is an understandable one. Hell, it'd be insane not to expect it, considering what we saw in the reveal footage. Almost nothing in it is reminiscent of the old Baldur's Gate games."

But that is a valid concern for a very good reason: quality assets seen in alpha previews of games are seldom if ever changed.

I don't agree that there isn't strategy without doing so, though. The Pillars of Eternity games require tons of strategy on the hardest difficulty, for example. If you don't believe me, you can try finishing them without careful strategy and micromanagement. Tell me how it goes.

But this debate is pointless because ultimately this is a matter of preference. It's akin to arguing that a third person camera is objectively better than first person. This is silly as it entirely comes down to preference. Neither is better. You can have a poor implementation of either, as you can have a superb one.
