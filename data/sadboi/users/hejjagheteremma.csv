ZeroWaste,fjhmqvm,t1_fjhf0bg,1583351123.0,No unfortunately not! It was a freebie from a papper napkin company. I did do a Google search and there seem to be a few tutorials though!
ZeroWaste,fjhexz1,t3_fdhecb,1583346803.0,I posted my collection a while back but I thought I'd post an updated version!
Kombucha,f7smdik,t1_f7qeuq1,1573996230.0,I used double the starter this time around luckily. I'll keep an eye on it then and look out for mold!
Kombucha,f7sm7n4,t1_f7mh4dd,1573996174.0,"Oh, then there might be hope for mine too. Good to know that I shouldn't give up after the first brew!"
Kombucha,f7slyaw,t1_f7m2b63,1573996080.0,I did! Guess I'll see what happens :)
depression,f7njo3s,t3_dx2la6,1573907140.0,"I've definitely noticed the same thing. A few years ago my favorite thing in the world was to read books, but I can't read books at all these days. I struggle immensely with reading what I have to read for school and it takes me forever to read anything since I keep drifting away thinking about other things. Seminars in school where we're supposed to participate in discussions are impossible, my brain doesn't work fast enough so I can't process what other people are saying much less say anything myself. And my memory is awful. I really hope these problems will get better with time :/"
ZeroWaste,f0e8nha,t3_d4m2as,1568564691.0,Your dogs are so lucky!!
ZeroWaste,ezssm4h,t1_ezsh3i3,1568107391.0,You can buy refillable cartridges! They're called fountain pen converters. I bought a cheap pen that wasn't refillable and a converter to replace the single use cartridges
upcycling,exfqkqu,t1_exffpvx,1566246255.0,Yes please share!! It's really pretty :)
ZeroWaste,ex6zika,t3_crmi6q,1566053887.0,I love wrapping gifts in newspaper! It's the only wrapping paper I use these days. I like decorating them with stuff from nature. Last christmas I tied chestnuts to them and next christmas I'm going to try making pine needle tassels! I also save bows and stuff that I get on gifts and then use them to decorate other gifts.
ZeroWaste,ewz1m19,t3_cqph9a,1565889906.0,That's awesome that it spread!! I have a piece of paper taped to my door that says the same thing :)
ZeroWaste,ewuoko1,t3_cq8pgh,1565787718.0,"Hi! My advice is to not replace everything you own with ""zero waste"" alternatives. The best thing is to use what you already have! And if you do need to buy something, see if you can get it second hand instead of buying it new :)"
ZeroWaste,ewud3bh,t1_ewu5zff,1565775802.0,I use cotton! The most recent ones I made were made from an old cotton curtain I thrifted :)
ZeroWaste,ewud13n,t1_ewu4wp7,1565775717.0,They're all cotton! Or at least I think so lol. The ones I made myself were made with thrifted cotton fabric too :)
ZeroWaste,ewucz2w,t1_ewsjngk,1565775641.0,"Thank you! I've also switched to fabric panty liners, but I don't think I'll be switching to fabric toilet cloths anytime soon haha. But using them for pee only does seem a lot more doable! Maybe I'll muster up the courage to make the change too"
ZeroWaste,ewsfqao,t1_ews31ok,1565726640.0,"I love them too!! I thought it'd be a hassle washing them but since I just wash them with my sheets and towels it's not like it's any extra work! I also like finding old patterned ones, they're so much prettier than paper ones!"
ZeroWaste,ewsfbmy,t1_ews69xb,1565726388.0,"So do I! My mum gave it to me, I think she got it as a freebie from a paper making company ðŸ˜…"
ZeroWaste,ewrvn3g,t3_cpq94h,1565714738.0,I've have these! The only problem is that they can be a bit tricky to put on if you're using them on bigger bowls and such. So they're not great for really big things. But I found that they stretch a lot more than I thought they would (as in they fit bigger things than the size of like the inner ring). Overall I'm pretty happy with them!
bipolar,esznus9,t3_c9lbsp,1562365034.0,I love it!! Is it made with stencils? :)
