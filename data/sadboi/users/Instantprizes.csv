Netsphere,foikb1o,t1_fnv6wwp,1587788799.0,"I donâ€™t know if this contributes or is even something you would agree with, but my take on the story is that there is a very large amount of character development and a lot of emotion involved.
The landscape, problems, characters and mechanics are absolutely alien to our reality so being able to interpret the point of view of the characters is an intricate and really fun thing to do.

I donâ€™t know, I think the themes involving sentient ai being transferred from body to body is a pretty big theme that deserves way more exploration and would be pretty fun for more people to speculate on.

Take Cibo! She is a human who goes from human, to forgotten bio-digital corpse, to robot, to part-safeguard, then to alternate dimensional corpse body, and then to world-ending/life-giving deathangel child-safeguard! What that demonstrates is that her human consciousness transcended flesh to coded-machine a few times, and so if her capability of feeling emotion transferred so easily then doesnâ€™t that open a whole can of worms on the safeguard, the silicone life and what they would feel in their sentience?

See the partnerships all throughout the story too. How much the characters would give up for the safety of their companions like iko, or Maeve. Even Killy had a lot of care for Cibo at the end. Honest to god, reading Blame! with attention to the human emotion side of it, the manga really does pull some powerful feel moments. 

Maybe Iâ€™m delusional but I think Blame! is a pretty awesome story about humanity and souls vs. the void of decay and automation."

I always had pretty vivid and epic dreams but as Iâ€™ve gotten older Iâ€™ve found the dreams have decreased or my ability to remember has decreased. Iâ€™m 29 and love dreams :)
Thank you for offering this!"

Psychic,flhon0u,t1_flhlspm,1585166593.0,"Maybe that is correct about not being awakened.
Iâ€™m kind of awful at explaining my feelings because I actually havenâ€™t taken any feelings of intuition very seriously until now. Itâ€™s hard for me to grasp on to what Iâ€™m feeling and how I should react or act. I guess just watch, listen."

MorbidReality,f8uoz2s,t1_f8r98w0,1574837418.0,"Iâ€™m aware of other genocides happening, and all pretty horrific.

But this is also horrifying and itâ€™s happening right now... at a time when we are more globalized than ever. 
In my head I understand weâ€™ve been at this bullshit forever and pretty much every couple of years it seems. 

This frightens me.
This looks systematic. You have to admit it looks familiar to the holocaust. Trains packed to overcapacity, people who seem so normal just whisked off to nothing, and the camp rumours that have been in our peripherals for years but only now is it realized as fact.

I donâ€™t want to argue with anyone about what I know or donâ€™t know about modern genocide. I didnâ€™t even have to say holocaust and you jumped on my comment anyways for apparently only ever being aware of that single event in history.

I am on this board after all. Shit happens again and again, but the fact they are using _trains_ and have _forever camps_ is just like, who let that happen?"

depression,f5z3pho,t3_dpl4bu,1572566397.0,"Thanks for writing this. I can absolutely relate. I have a big smile and love to laugh it up with the people I work with, and I work hard and with care. At the end of the day when I walk out the door I just feel my face drop because Iâ€™m so tired of being.
Thereâ€™s been days I get home from work and just bawl for no reason.
A handful of days might be a manageable, light-feeling time but Iâ€™ve learned to expect at least a couple of days where I wonder hard about why Iâ€™m alive.

I manage to shower everyday and I pay my bills on time. I have a spacious suite and a small companion as my friend. I look presentable and clean. But I do slip up which Iâ€™m ashamed of. I have troubles keeping up with laundry after I clean it so I just have a pile. Sometimes the insomnia gets me and I sleep in and arrive late to work. Moments at work find me trembling noticeably to others.
So far I have always found myself back together again though. So far.

Iâ€™m trying to remind myself to have hope, and to be grateful for what I have- even the work. The Hope helps in the darker moments.
We got this far and we deserve to be brave."
