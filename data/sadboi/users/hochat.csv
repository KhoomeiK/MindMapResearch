iran,fqxahh3,t1_fqx8l6y,1589728978.0,"*Fascism* doesn't build the institutional basis that a democracy needs. It actively uses democratic means for the most part to destroy labor and civil interest groups and subordinate businesses and individuals to an ""organic state"". This means there is no personal realm, and private enterprises are incentivized, often by contracts, fiscal incentives, and sometimes force and coercion, to contribute to goals that the state deems as necessary. This is often used for war and imperialism.

The institutional basis for democracy is already there when fascism takes over because Fascism at root is a *mass movement* which needs mass media, populism, and party politics to come about. Fascism then moves to destroy or render useless the very same democratic institutions and set the country back. The Weimar Republic is an example- monarchy was giving way to parliamentarianism and the authoritarian reforms of Bismarck actually came back to haunt Germany, in many ways putting the later regimes, especially the Weimar Republic, in a straightjacket. This, plus circumstances and the culture at the time contributed to the failure of the Republic, and once it was delegitimized, authoritarian groups took over. Eventually fascism took over and destroyed or subordinated all democratic and civil institutions to its ideological goal, and set up a dual state as well.

It's not true that one needs ""strongmen"" to create the basis for democracy. Democracy of the liberal kind is part of the superstructure that capitalism needs to sustain itself, and that socialism needs to take root. This develops over time as the material realities of the given society change from a feudal mode of production to a capitalist one. Each step of the way- think the Constitutional Revolution, etc- chips away at the old superstructure- religion, monarchy, authoritarianism, tradition- until the system as a whole gives way to something more compatible with capitalist development. In this way, the new ideas that take root represent interests of the public which begins to see the old superstructure as ""oppressive"". Think of how slavery was once ubiquitous and even in some cases argued as a good thing, then as material realities changed, it was seen as bad and oppressive and eventually done away with as societies moved toward indentured servitude, artisanship and serfdom. This concept is called ""historical materialism"". The material bases of society- mode of production and reproduction- drive the superstructure- the beliefs, religions, ideologies, institutions, and modes of relation/culture.

So where does fascism come in all of this? Fascism is unique in that it is a nebulous ideology that generally focuses on state power while preserving private property. That is, it maintains the capitalist mode of production. It is regressive in that it combats socialism and enforces property rights, tradition, family and religion, four essential components of the capitalist superstructure. And it does so ruthlessly and annihilates (or attempts to) class warfare by introduction of ""class collaboration"" where all sectors of society are seen as integral to the functioning of the ""national body"". In essence, it gaslights people into believing class differences don't exist, or are necessary and everyone does their part in the movement of the ""nation"". It's tempting to say fascism may make the trains run on time and restore order to ""build a nation"", but it often destroys the very democratic institutions necessary for stability in the long run, and in practice it needs war- enemies within and without- to continue to justify its intrusion into the private lives of citizens and its destruction of working class power and handing of power over to private interests and elites. None of this is what Reza Shah did, and none of this was done in Iran with exception of it being close to what the Islamic Republic does. Except, in the Islamic Republic, the ""organic state"" and ""nation"" are replaced with the ""Islamic ummah""."

It's a matter of whether these friends grow in the same direction as us. To that end, a healthy approach that emphasizes impermanence and lets go of control is crucial.

I empathize with your predicament. Clinical work and social work in general puts us in a unique position where we receive a crash course in how people work and how relationships work. We mature at a faster rate than laypeople in this regard, and often come to see patterns and deficits in relationships. It's also a function of maturation in general, to see that old friendships don't necessarily fit the person we are evolving into.

Life itself is a fundamentally solitary experience. What I mean by that is, despite family and friends, the journey is *yours and yours only* from birth to death. Every thing you do and experience has profound and personal consequences for you, and you are given choices and responsibilities every step of the way. These consequences and changes in life trajectory affect *you* most profoundly, and there are residual affects on the people around you. But key to growth is understanding that from many points of view, your life is yours alone and it is a fundamentally lonely experience. From that comes the necessity to build boundaries- external with others, and internal within yourself- and define your own purpose, goals, criteria of evaluation, and narrative. And key to that is healthy detachment that allows you to maintain your sense of self when around others, and allows you to let go when your relationships run their course. There's a joy to understanding life as a solitary experience, and it will help you become your own best friend and biggest ally. Psychology dubs this ""individuation"". Good luck in your journey and remember- you are whole with or without others in your life, and you are responsible to yourself primarily, and whatever family you create.

You're not a hack, you don't give yourself credit where it is due and you work in a hard field. However, labeling this in such a heavy-handed way has a tendency of ""officializing"" and categorizing your experience and *you yourself* as a function and being. It's detrimental and self-defeating. We all suffer from not knowing 100% what to do in each and every situation, and as such each situation offers us learning opportunities as a clinician. Furthermore, ""imposter"" feelings often arise from needing to mirror with others around you for your performance. Hence, being with other clinicians provides outside criteria to measure yourself with. Unfortunately, in life and in the field, you won't always have the opportunity to obtain this external validation and need to develop a core sense of self. Take inventory of all the positive things and important things you have done in your role and the things you have survived and learned from. That is a start. Also- do you see someone? It's crucial for all clinicians to be in some form of therapy themselves to understand their contribution to situations and how the field affects them. This is crucial and I think you'd greatly benefit from some sort of psychodynamic, deep form of therapy where you can build upon your sense of self and strengthen your confidence while understanding yourself and your problems, and how the field triggers them.

It's going to suck at first because many agencies take advantage of new graduates and low-ball you with offers of $40-45K but if you know your worth and job-hop with the aim of learning new skills, EHR's and gaining experience in group, medical, and individual psychotherapy, you can do very well for yourself when you land the job that you stay at long-term. Don't quit. Even if you can't get back into the field just yet. We are in a pandemic and this complicates things.

As society transitions to a superstructure that is more compatible with new material realities, both roles of men and women will change. That's when you look back and realize that the old way of things was detrimental to both sexes. It starts with little changes, challenges from the most oppressed or most vocal elements, then those who were less involved realize their stake in social change as well. A big part of this is also, the social ideas arising in the 1960's and onward about gender relations tended to be rather black and white and pitted the sexes against one another as the focus was on the oppression of women, while ignoring that men also suffered from privations and hardships under traditional norms. The invalidation from this and toxic notions of masculinity also make it such that ""women can't hear what men don't say"" and create a situation where the top ten percent of men who are in the upper echelons of the middle and wealthy classes come to be equated with men as a whole, and the alliance between men and women of middle and working classes fails to come to fruition due to the inherent divisiveness of the fledgling approach to social change.

unpopularopinion,fqa4hie,t3_ghez6v,1589212662.0,"Situations in life aren't black and white. It takes two to tango, outside factors influence a dynamic. Humans are fallible and capable of learning. If someone is swallowing their pride, acknowledging their wrong and seeking to make amends and be forgiven, it's a huge sign of maturity on their part. I've found that apart from extreme cases, those who don't forgive are exercising some sort of vengeance by holding power over the other party and denying them the chance to redeem themselves. That it itself often highlights that the original conflict consisted of more than just that person deciding to wrong the other person. It shows how multifaceted and mutual the conflict was. Many hold grudges, and it's no way to live.

Apologize, ask for forgiveness but be prepared to not get it. In AA they say ""make amends except in those cases where doing so will result in more trouble"". Most people operate on talionic notions of justice and those who are wronged but feel damage to their pride often are blind to the continuation of misery they perpetuate by denying forgiveness. Forgiveness is about peace of mind for both of you. 

It reminds me of the 16 Horsepower song ""Black Soul Choir"". The singer realizes he's human and capable of wrongdoing, and doesn't hold onto hate for wrongdoers or see himself as better- some days he acts the same way. That's key when it comes to forgiveness and letting go- recalling all the times you've hurt others or acted less honorably. If you were crucified or punished for every time without being given the chance to redeem yourself, chances are your pride will solidify and you'd keep going down the path of wrongdoing, seeing no point in growing and righting past wrongs.

In life you will hurt others, be hurt by them, repair and grow. There's no escaping it. Factors contribute to make a situation what it is, and it's often more than the black and white ""your fault/my fault"". Asking for forgiveness and giving it requires the humility of knowing that your pain isn't the most significant thing, that growth is possible, and that we all have a wicked, imperfect streak. You will be the villain in someone's story. It's a guarantee. No one is a saint and people need their villains. It's all a growing process.

This of course clashes with Iraqis who traditionally see themselves as ethnically and nationally separate from Iranians, and centuries of anti-Persian sentiment. In many ways it worsens the friction. Iran's actions for instance in propping up Maliki's corrupt and sectarian government gave rise to ISIL, which the Iranian government and its ideologues attribute to a Western conspiracy. While ISIL did benefit from Western actions against Iran, Assad and his militias, it was still not a ""US creation"" but rather became powerful due to opportunism in the power vacuum, mismanagement and oppression perpetrated by Maliki and his Iranian handlers. ISIL was active in Iraq as ISI and before it, AQI under Zarqawi, and had in the past coordinated with the IRGC during the Iraq occupation.

Iran's foreign moves often are wrought with backlash and Iran finds itself putting out fires it created. While it has successfully in many ways limited Western interference in the areas it dominates, it hangs on by a thread and often scores Pyrrhic victories. Resource wise and soft power wise, Iran's grip in the region is condemned to being on the brink of collapse without active interventions, which often worsen the resentment that average Iraqis have for Iran and in the end will be capitalized upon by the West. Iran simply does not have the resources or capacity to continue this long term if the West decides to double down its efforts and take advantage of the Arab resentment against Iran. Lastly, the Iranian establishment downplays the loss of Soleimani, who by tact, guile, connections and force of personality cobbled together the Axis of Resistance network and settled disputes between various actors, often brokering deals and mediations between various factions. His absence is a serious blow to Iranian ambitions in the region as not a single commander possessed his intelligence, connections, or ease with people. His replacements are bureaucrats and the ""council"" idea that will replace his command opens the Iranian forces up to a situation where they cannot use the cult of personality that a single commander could create to serve as a unifying force. The impersonal approach of a council simply won't have the same pull and is going to be burdened with slow decision making and structural problems such as infighting and conflicts of interest. Soleimani's personality and approach worked best with the decentralized nature of his militia network- a council may not work as well with a decentralized network, and further centralization of the militia and party network may lead to newer structural problems."

Many of these politicians in the West that support the MEK do so for their own reasons- to win more clout with certain bases within their own parties, to win backing and contributions from lobbies, some for money and promotions, some out of ideological convictions. And likewise on the IR side.

Unfortunately, in the West ""what's best for Iranian people"" doesn't factor as much. Mostly because most Westerners are far removed from the personal experiences of Iranians. When the only groups with a voice in the West are those who aren't the best for Iran, it's only natural that Westerners that are exposed to Iranian issues see them as a bandwagon to jump on. The more cynical Western politicians, I'm sure, simply don't care about Iranian people and are endorsing MEK purely for their own political agenda."

dbtselfhelp,foyfa5s,t1_fowhyoe,1588171473.0,"I'd need to know more. If you've been practicing your skills and learning to tap into and differentiate Wise Mind from Logical or Emotion, perhaps it is an indication. I can describe Wise Mind as intuition. You know and trust your truth while balancing the cool approach of Logic and validating your Emotions, using your emotional reaction as well as thinking skills to arrive at your truth. For instance, someone in Wise Mind would know why they have an emotional reaction to something and instead of acting upon it, they use their logical mind to keep an emotional distance so they can reach the intuition underneath and make the right decision for themselves. Here's an example:

Your friend flakes on hanging out, which you've planned for a week. He/she has done this before several times. You are upset and feel betrayed. Emotion Mind would have you yelling at your friend and trying to change or guilt the person into complying with what you want, and you will be prone to seeing him/her as all bad (splitting), and with it all of his/her abandonments in the past, plus your core abandonments from childhood, come together to create this overwhelming emotional response that actually worsens your relationship with them and pushes them to flake on you again in the future. Remember, part of it is their character and their actions of flaking, you can't change that. Part of it, though, is your response which only reinforces their avoidant behavior.

Logical Mind would express itself this way: you recognize the pattern. You recognize that your actions augment their pattern of avoidance and make things worse, and that this is a relationship that mirrors your core childhood abandonment and recreates that childhood drama. You recognize that this present recreation serves as your mind's desperate attempt to right a past wrong, to recreate a history where you weren't abandoned during childhood.

Wise mind would take these two and validate the emotions of hurt and betrayal- both from childhood and the present situation. It would also see how it triggers you to recreate this. Deep down, you get the sense that this relationship with your friend is going to be a repetition of your childhood abandonment and hurt your mental health in the long run, and that the right thing for you to do is either find a new, more suitable friendship, or greatly lower your expectations of this friend such that it does not hurt as much. A wise mind decision would be to validate your feeling and why this situation is wrong for you, and act accordingly.

Much of this at first is actively conscious and requires skills and introspection. So, I don't know your situation fully enough to differentiate whether or not it's an unconscious ""isolation of affect"" that happens, or whether you're actively engaging Logical Mind. But in order for you to reach Wise Mind, you need to validate the hurt that comes from it in such a way that you aren't overwhelmed with dammed up emotions from the past events that this current event links itself to. And with the validation of your emotion (being your own ally and parent) as well as a clear-headed look at your options, you've dialectically synthesized both frames of mind and arrive at a decision that is best for yourself. This takes practice, and over time becomes more and more effortless and automatic. You have to use Radical Acceptance to non-judgmentally accept that X happened, and you feel Y as a result of it, and it's not *bad that you feel it*, it just is. So that way you don't invalidate yourself and stuff the emotion down or intensify your emotional response.

Hope that helps."

iran,fow5beb,t1_fow3ehp,1588113287.0,"The U.S and to an extent Iran as more developed countries cannot be compared to agrarian societies in the undeveloped world. The entire experience of people there is different, opportunities are different, social structures are different, values are different. In countries like the U.S. the lack of opportunity in a structure that benefits only certain classes of people mixes with the availability of drugs and the high demand for drugs in order to make it not only a lucrative outlet but a means to secure respect, economic stability, and a way out of the cycle of poverty. The entire structure and superstructure is different in African or Cambodian villages, so you can't even begin to compare the two. We can go on and on about why the U.S.A has the highest demand for illicit drugs in the world, but these are arguments which combine multitudes of factors and nuance, and I'm afraid you can't just dismiss things like this by saying ""well what about the poor in Africa""?

iran,fovzhrh,t3_g9fxne,1588110262.0,"By killing these child offenders, they are robbing them of the ability to redeem themselves. Often those of us who have been through the darkest, with the right intervention and influences, can become some of the best members of society. The lived experiences and consequences of prior offenders can serve as an example for better behavior, if the right approach is used. This is the idea behind rehabilitative approach vs. punitive approach. Research has shown that rehabilitation reduces recidivism rates while punitive approach hardens criminals, in addition to institutionalized practices that make re-entry harder. In the US, these factors combine with poor education to create the school-to-prison pipeline where lack of opportunity leads to petty crimes and drug dealing, then a punitive justice system turns people into hardened criminals who live on taxpayer dollars serving long sentences in prison and on parole/probation. In Iran, the system is even more punitive and runs on a dual secular and Islamic law apparatus which does not take outcomes-based research and efforts as seriously, as the system tries to keep its religious legitimacy.

Capital punishment as a whole serves to deter some cases, but in cases of criminals with sociopathy or other risk factors that lead to high recidivism rates it doesn't seem to deter. Iran's capital punishment includes drug dealers and other non-violent crimes, and while arguably it has stemmed some of the excesses of the drug problem in Iran, you have to ask yourself how many people on Iran's death row would have changed their behavior if there was a rehabilitative approach applied earlier in their criminal careers? And furthermore, most death rows contain a percentage of innocent people who slipped through the cracks or were framed, and these people factor as collateral damage. In my opinion, the death penalty should be reserved for the most severe cases where psychopathy or other intrinsic factors prevent meaningful rehabilitation and the inmate is likely to kill again and commit more crimes in the system. This, too, requires an extensive analysis, and the system often does not have the resources or intent to carry it out.

Back to the topic of children- neuroplasticity research shows that formative periods such as middle childhood and adolescence, even the person's second decade in life are ""pruning periods"" where old neural pathways and resultant behaviors are pruned out and new neural pathways are formed. This leads to characterological change, and accounts for the fast rates of human psychological maturation between ages 13-30. Events in life in these ages hold greater impact in shaping the brain's neural pathways and indeed people *do change* in these periods, often for the better. Research has shown children who would qualify for personality disorder diagnoses, attachment disorders and conduct disorders, given rehabilitation and therapy, along with relationships with mentors and a strong safety net of teacher, family resources and work opportunities do in fact recede in antisocial behavior and can grow to become quite functional and pro-social members of society. But this depends on whether funding is being put into mental health programs, rehabilitation programs, schooling, et cetera. If there is any point in the lifetime to intervene and forge a new trajectory, it's between ages 13-30 as the brain's maturation rate is much faster. By executing adolescents, they are taking away this chance. If Iran could contribute a share of the money they spend on religious institutions, or botched wealth distribution schemes, or even a percentage of money lost to corruption, toward strengthening education systems and community resources, many of these kids would get second chances in life. Unfortunately, in addition to the lack of available resources and mismanagement, Iran's society also suffers from the effects of cultural problems, authoritarianism, et cetera. Authoritarian family types which are ubiquitous in Iran tend to reinforce antisocial acting-out and prevent adequate outcomes in rehabilitation. Both Iran and the U.S. have this problem, and culture often reinforces institutional failures that keep criminal behavior going."

iran,fosupvo,t3_g8r55q,1588038440.0,"Most Iranians are Muslims, however, practice differs. I would say the imams and the Shi'a folklore have become part of Iran's culture and Iran has ""Iranified"" Twelver Shi'a Islam, mixing it with themes of Siavash and other national myth figures. However, in the major cities most Iranians nominally identify with Islam and practice privately, perhaps going to the mosque a few times a year at best. Compare it to how Americans go to church sometimes out of custom or even personal spirituality, but aren't necessarily there every Sunday, thumping the Bible and calling gay people the devil.

After the revolution, Khomeini's idea of an ideal Islamic society was one which was enforced from the top down in a hierarchical matter. The idea was if society was made Islamic from the top down, individuals will act virtuously. Hence, part of it was enforcing a dress code, religious learning in schools, mandatory Arabic, and more funding for Islamic festivals and bonyads. Some clerics went as far as erasing pre-Iranian history from books and lessening the importance of pre-Iranian or non-Islamic myths, figures, and cultural rituals. Iranians in the rural and village regions tended to be devout anyway, but Iranians in areas with higher literacy and education tended to be less devout, and associated more with ""cultural Islam"" or rather the blend of Islamic and pre-Islamic beliefs. The urban poor also tended to be very devout. To varying degrees, the top-down decrees were followed, but it was not something the educated or middle classes jumped to do. Even among the merchant petty bourgeoisie which supported the clerics, the Islamization of society wasn't wholly appreciated. More theocratic measures created more resentment, especially as the Islamic Republic continued reforms which led to higher literacy and education rates, and more power for women as a result. This led to a clash where the middle and upper middle classes, and even the working classes took issue with the social approaches of the Islamic Republic and called for social reforms that relaxed dress code, religious behavior, etc. An overwhelming contingent of the voters for Khatami, for instance, were middle class people from urban centers, while much of the support for candidates like Ahmadinejad and other conservatives were from the working and rural classes. 

The Iranian diaspora differs as well, since much of the diaspora came in waves with characteristics that make them less religious. First were pre-Shah era Iranians who migrated West, and upper-middle class Iranians who migrated as the revolution occurred. These people were already exposed to Western educations and were technicians and professionals of varying types, accustomed to material means and quickly absorbed Western culture. Then there are war migrants and economic migrants, who were largely middle class, and for whom religion was a mixed bag- some were religious, others not, and most adapted well to the Western separation of church and state. Newer migrant groups tend to also have the same makeup. But in all, as more Iranians coalesce into urban centers and literacy and education rates increase, the strict or devout attachment to religion and folklore decreases. An unintended consequence of the Islamic Republic's policies were that a more educated populace pushed for more secular reforms and embraced more secular policies like contraception, women's rights, etc, that opposed the initial ideals of Islamic Republic. Interestingly, there are many Iranians converting to Baha'ism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism. My family converted to Christianity, and I know of a few ""New Zoroastrians"" (of course, they run into trouble being accepted by older Zoroastrians and Indian Parsis in their community, but their numbers are growing). Many also convert out to be able to apply for political asylum given the Islamic Republic's laws against apostasy."

In my time in school we were taught that there are three types of racism- individual, cultural and structural. Minorities can have the first two, but you need power for the third. Now, academia is saying there is only one type of racism- structural (you can also thank people like Ta-Nehisi Coates who milk the victim mentality and promote passivity). All else are just prejudice or interethnic tension. This leads to the erroneous idea that only whites can be racist, because all racism is about power. There are a lot of instances where the most downtrodden ethnic group targets other more successful minorities out of their own ignorance and feelings of collective powerlessness to challenge the white power structure. As a non-white ""model"" minority member most of the racism (and I mean physical harm motivated by racial hatred) I personally experienced came from lower income minorities that assume I'm somehow a beneficiary of the white power structure because I'm not like them.
