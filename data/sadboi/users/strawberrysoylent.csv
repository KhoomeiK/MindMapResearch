Is your partner medicated or in therapy? If not this is really important. If you are able to go therapy with them, that would also be really beneficial for the both of you. A safe space to communicate with a professional can help release tension and make it easier to open up. This kinda sounds like your partner isn’t being very kind to you, and theres no excuse for that, mental illness or not. You gotta put yourself first and be treated the way you deserve.
