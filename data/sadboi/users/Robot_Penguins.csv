furniturerestoration,fp9w3x0,t1_fp9tkpk,1588435781.0,"The laminate is probably hit with a wood pattern somehow during manufacturing. Kind of like ceramic tile looks like wood. 

To paint anything requires a lot of prep and if you don't prep it right, it ends up peeling. Just know that painting is a temporary solution. It will eventually chip no matter how well its prepped. I dont paint laminate, but I'm going to give you my general process for painting furniture, with recommendations for laminate. 

If you have big dents or gouges, you might be able to get away with using wood filler since the MDF would be exposed. So fix any big issues. If its not exposed, the only thing I can think of that might work is Bondo. Not sure on this. 

Once the filler(s) are sanded appropriately, clean the furniture with a good cleaner. I use Spray Nine. Then sand it, you want to scuff it all up so the primer can adhere to it. 

ETA: wipe clean, use a tack cloth to get any leftover bits so the primer can adhere well. 

When you get into primers, I personally want something that will stick to anything so I use shellac based primers. Whatever you get, make sure its for shiny surfaces. 

After the first coat of primer, I sand, wipe down with a cloth and use a tack cloth to get anything left behind. 

Apply 2nd coat of primer. 
Sand, clean, wipe, tack cloth. 

Paint needs to be compatible with your primer.

I use latex or alykd depending on the project as shellac primer is compatible with both. I spray my furniture but I'd recommend a high quality angled brush for inside corners and a 4"" roller. You probably want a foam roller since its smooth. Get good ones. From my personal experience, cheap rollers (yellow foam) are too porous. Even the good ones don't cost too much. 

I very lightly sand the paint if there are any issues. Wipe, tack cloth. 

Make sure to follow manufacturer guidelines on drying time. Let the furniture cure for at least week unless otherwise stated, before putting anything in it/on it. This allows it to harden. 

You might also try searching ""laminate"" in this group or a painting group to see if there are more specific directions for painting laminate.

Adding, I don't work with milk or chalk paint often and am unsure if they'll work for laminate.

You likely also want to seal the coffee table. Satin polyurcan work. Let it harden before using it or you'll have rings from cups and whatnot."

Ikea is laminate, there's no good refinishing for that. I suppose you can use Bondo and repaint the whole thing. But paint doesn't stick well to laminate so you'd need to sand all that's being painted, use an alkyd primer and paint. Just way more work (and cost of supplies) than it's worth. It still might peel. 

If its a wood veneer, you can use wood putty and lightly sand, wood veneer is usually 0.5-2mm in thickness so you're not working with much but its possible, depending on the damage."
