AskReddit,fijloiy,t3_f87ayr,1582453884.0,"I began masturbating at an extremely young age. And when I was around 11, one night my older brother texted me to come into his room. I was suspicious, because his lights were off and he wouldn‚Äôt answer when I spoke outside the door saying ‚Äúwhat is it‚Äù? And just texted me to come In. I ignored it and went back to bed.

In the morning I told my mom, and when she confronted him he said he just ‚Äúwanted me to turn on his light‚Äù.

His light is outside his room.

Not in. 

I suspect I was sexually abused by him before I could remember, but have 0 proof. If I try to talk to my parents about it, they claim they don‚Äôt remember that night or that it happened or make up excuses/justifications as to why he may have ever abused me if he did.

It‚Äôs not worth trying to get to the bottom of. Me demanding answers of what his intentions were that night would cause endless issues on top of our already dysfunctional family. It actually is best for everyone if I let my go."

rarepuppers,fijfx4l,t3_f82aun,1582446126.0,"Hey fren, a couple things regarding the prong!

Placement- please make sure you move that prong collar up. It needs to be high up and snug around the neck, with the rings on the side. To get the right fit, you‚Äôll need to remove one of the links. It‚Äôs current position is way too low, and the communication isn‚Äôt effective and the dog will blow you off. Even worse, too low, and you could risk simulating the feeling of a dog attack, which could turn to dog- dog aggression.

Size- I also highly recommend a smaller prong collar size, 2.25mm would be PERFECT for him. 

Prong links are sized by fur length, not the size of the dog. A short haired pup like yours would need a small prong collar, and then buy extra links to make it long enough, while a dog with extra long fur gets the big links! 

Prevent slipping- To prevent slipping, a traditional bandana tied around the neck right below the prong collar works great.

Safety- Prongs are sturdy, but can fail. If your prong collar were to fail without a backup, you could lose your dog! To prevent this, hook your leash to the prong collar AND the D ring on your flat buckle collar, so if the prong were to ever accidentally release, you still have your pup!

Here is a guide, I promise you you‚Äôll see a HUGE change in your pup
