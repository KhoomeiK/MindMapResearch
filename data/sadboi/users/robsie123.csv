I look at loads of people at school and think how are they so confident about sharing their sense of humour with other kids and expressing themselves???

JaneTheVirginCW,fnigv2o,t3_g1tuqk,1586979769.0,I think she spoke in Spanish cos Xo and Jane understood. One of the few times she spoke English was when she was confronting Magda.
depression,fnhel1n,t1_fngtkdj,1586960910.0,Yes I have that issue too. I always have to be so careful about what I say to other kids cos I fear that they’ll discuss me behind my back if I say the wrong thing.
