BPD,fjgng05,t3_fcrfpo,1583331286.0,"Wow! I think we’re all familiar with it. 

I sort of think of it as a script that was created when we were children. We’re always in the wrong. 

So even if we’re not in the wrong but the other person is angry we try to make it better (I say we, but I don’t mean everyone!).  

When we try to make it better it reinforces the view and behaviour for the other person. We’ve basically said ‘yes, I’m wrong again so sorry’ and then they see their behaviour as appropriate. 

I then they think we’re acting so bpd. Like, if Bob was in the same situation he would slapped with a stereotype. 

I hope that makes sense. 

I’ve noticed it across a few of my relationships. I know it started with my dad and now any close male friends or partners or even people in power like my boss, I react in the same way over and over again. 

It’s a pattern. We partly (not through our fault at all) create the narrative. 

My guilt is so strong when I think someone is mad at me I go into overdrive to make it better. I probably should be questioning it or be angry but I just want to get out of the horrid situation and get rid of the feeling. 

I may have rambled. I haven’t slept in a while 🤦‍♀️"
BPD,fjgms4k,t3_fd655x,1583330829.0,"Yup. Bought theatre tickets the other day. A load of hair stuff I didn’t need. I’m incredibly bad with money. Like, terrible. 

I’m too impulsive. And sometimes I can’t control it. I think everything is fine in the moment and don’t think about the future."
BPD,fjgmkwf,t3_fd1lhv,1583330686.0,"God, yes! I was trying to explain this to my friend today. I feel like I have happy manic impulsive me and sad flat depressed me. And both the different sides don’t like each other. 

I feel it must me so confusing for people In my office. I change too often. I’ll go a week of one and then maybe a week of the other. It’s tiring and I hate it. I don’t know who I am anymore."
BPD,f7963gh,t1_f5rcb8n,1573503112.0,"Thank you :) I did think maybe that was it,  then I doubted myself and thought I was overreacting! 

Trolls are truly cowards."
