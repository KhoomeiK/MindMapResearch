FortniteBRuniversity,fnxc557,t1_fnxbzeg,1587335656.0,"yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. Learning lots from Tfue. What to do what not to do, etc"
FortniteBRuniversity,fnxb5ye,t3_g456rx,1587335096.0,"Your eDPI is a little bit low consider raising it because playing low sense In a boxfight heavy meta won‚Äôt work. The best pro players predominately play high sense. Benjy. Khanada, MrSavage, etc. Even the low sense prodigy, ZexRow, turned his sense up

Regarding mechanics I feel like you might be slower at editing going off the fact that you‚Äôre only in Division 4. Higher sense will help you make faster edits and be able to flick to your edited wall, for example, if you need to reset it. Once you turn your sense up practice around 2 hours a day to see maximum mechanical improvement and watch itsJerians videos on YouTube for aim guides, practice routines, etc. 

Since you said you VOD Review (yourself I‚Äôm guessing) then start watching pros who are similar to you. If you like low sense more than watch kbm pros who are low sense and same ping and FPS as you. Finding someone to relate to can help improve. And also just watch pros in general because everytime a watch a pro players VOD I PROMISE YOU I learn something new EVERY TIME.

Also consider changing your play style because I switched to kbm in December and my play style on controller was lazer someone, then jump into their box and dominate with aim assist. But there‚Äôs no aim assist on kbm and a good point my duo partner (who‚Äôs on controller) brought to me is that since there‚Äôs no aim assist I got to change my play style to trying to get tags on people from afar then start boxfight.

You will NEVER win bloomfights and you should stop taking 50/50s because if you‚Äôre on kbm up against a controller player or cracked kbm player it becomes a 10/90 instead. Play smart, go for peaks, flick shots, bait edits, just play to the strengths of a kbm player and promise you‚Äôll be fine. I land at a spot that has TONS of fishing holes so if I get pushed in zone I know that I‚Äôm winning the fight because I have fish and I‚Äôm on kbm.

Confidence is big aswell and calling the player that you‚Äôre fighting dogshit might come off as toxic but it goes a long way in your brain and you‚Äôll be more confident because you think (and probably know if they‚Äôre acting brain dead and pushing) that they are dogshit

But regarding the meta I think playing controller is a lot more helpful largely due to aim assist. Since you know both my advice is to practice playing hybrid that way you can play (and with hope and a lot of practice) be good at both and dominate.


I also have a couple of maps that you should try:

Skaavoks Aim Trainer Ch2 - 8022-6842-4965
Kroaders Aim Dual Map - 8082-3111-1094

Edit: Hope this helps xD. Good luck out there!

Edit 2: FNCS is also going on as I‚Äôm writing this so grab a notebook and a pen and hop on Tfue stream and try learning something."

FortniteBRuniversity,fnbhj16,t3_g0ini1,1586815637.0,"Don‚Äôt spend your 3 hours a day VOD reviewing you can send the files of you playing scrims to google drive or Dropbox or even email it to yourself and watch it on your phone off of the 3 hours. Spend those hours on creative and scrims. 

I‚Äôd say find a good warmup video like the one itsJerian made titled ‚ÄúThe BEST Warmup for Console & PC - Edit/Aim Courses in Fortnite Season 2‚Äù and try to crunch that warmup into maybe 20-30 minutes and spend the rest of your time playing Arena/Scrims/Tournaments. 

You won‚Äôt see much mechanically improvement in a week but over time your gamesense will improve and don‚Äôt just VOD Review watch ItsJerians videos off of your 3 hours and you‚Äôll se major improvement and gamesense."
FortniteBRuniversity,fnbdxsv,t3_g0l2op,1586813823.0,"And also make sure to practice your aim as well and not just builds and edits because that was a mistake I made and it‚Äôs taking even longer for me to learn how to aim because I never practiced it when I started

When you start you have a motivation to keep improving because your completely trash. Make sure improving aim along with builds and edits is on the list of things to improve.

Also try to make your key binds as optimal as possible and watch itsJerians videos on improving fast and efficiently, and his guidelines on how to choose optimal keybinds"

FortniteCompetitive,fm8lkg2,t1_fm8l9ap,1585851573.0,I play both but mainly solos. My duo partner isn‚Äôt good at playing solo tho. He isn‚Äôt confident enough to play by himself. So sometimes he needs me to play duos with him so he can do better

Sometimes we leave with 8 floppers each other times only one of us leaves with 3.

But we always have floppers going into midgame and most of the time we don‚Äôt get zone so we either take a boat and get the chance of being lazered of it or rotate on foot causing us to waste floppers and we still get held in storm or get pushed once we‚Äôre in zone and end up storm fighting.

You have to place in the Top 1000 teams to then move on to Semi-Finals which are also on Friday at a later time. Then the the Top 100 Teams go to Finals which is the one on Saturday. You just didn‚Äôt understand the FNCS System or you‚Äôre in a different region or time zone or something."
FortniteCompetitive,fm806mm,t1_fm7y0j4,1585840281.0,"Not necessarily. If I go for placement as you‚Äôre saying and get Top 25 (60 points) and Top 15 (30 points) then I‚Äôll get 90 points. But I get a minus 40 bus fare so unless I make it to Top 5 which isn‚Äôt guaranteed because of psycho kids pushing. Plus even if I don‚Äôt push others I always end up in a fight because I got pushed by a psycho kid which most of the time I end up killing them unless they‚Äôre a controller player that sprays me out of the air which kills my mentality and I start tilting. Or I get sprayed of a boat rotating.

But if it were a perfect world and that never happened I still would need to get Top 5 for another 30 points and a kill or just the top 15 and 3 kills to even it out for 100 points a game."

If your controller is still under warranty than I‚Äôd say get it replaced but if it‚Äôs not then you can either A. Buy a new controller or B. Find a YouTube tutorial on how to fix drift.
