EDAnonymous,fglvbf1,t3_eys6tg,1580911802.0,Hey. I know its tough. But im here to tell you that this as 85%   most likely not your fault. As humans it is normal and very common for people to fall I out of love when they cant be together physically. Because physical presence is very important in attraction. It gets as specific as attract to ones natural odor. There is a lot of science behind it. But I can almost a sure you that this is in no way your fault. Also. The fact that he was to scared to tell you the reason in the first place shows that he very much does care about you and your thoughts and feelings.  I hope you can find someone once you can get through the grief. Pm me any time. I'll listen. Im here for you. <3
