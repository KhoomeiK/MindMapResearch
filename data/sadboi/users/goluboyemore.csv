TrueOffMyChest,fhfspe1,t3_f2tq86,1581550405.0,"I‚Äôve been locked up 5 times now... your experience is unfortunately not unique. One time I woke up to a completely deranged woman petting my eye brows and mumbling incoherently while I was napping in my room which she was not allowed to enter. Another time an older lady tried to attack me in the cafeteria for referring to her as grandma, which I had obtained permission from none other than herself to do earlier that day. Another time they searched my room and found my hate scribbles about the doctors, calling them cunts etc. they took the pages and the doctor confronted me and as punishment I couldn‚Äôt leave the ward for another 48 hours.

Also this is a bit unbelievable, but on TWO separate occasions at two separate hospitals, I found the fucking doors unlocked. On one occasion it was a back door (to the outside) that was left propped open. All I had to do was open it and walk out. The other occasion the metal gates in the courtyard were left slightly ajar. In full view of everyone I opened and closed the gates a few times( picture manic Cheshire grin) : some patients noticed but staff didn‚Äôt. Again all I had to do was walk out and nonchalantly stroll out of sight. 

Listen I don‚Äôt care what ANYONE says, mental hospitals are NOT safe places. Not for someone suicidal and especially not for someone who is bordering on suicidal. 15 minute checks at night ensure you can‚Äôt get proper rest but during the day? It‚Äôs a fucking free for all. We had people peeing on the floor and screaming. I tongued my meds for a week and no one batted an eye. They. Do. Not. Care. 

Best part? $30,000+ medical bill for various ‚Äútreatments‚Äù. These included: coloring with broken crayons, pills, shots, banging on ‚Äúinstruments‚Äù, pills, smoke breaks (1 cig provided), shots, yoga, gym time, watching fucking Tony Robinson videos?? Shots. Strapped to a bed. Shots. Held down till you overheat. 

In short my friend, the next time you feel like telling a shrink anything of real importance.. don‚Äôt."
