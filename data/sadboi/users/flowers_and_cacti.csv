Communication is key here.

You have every right to walk away if it's getting too tiring for you. It's your decision to make. If you want to stay and try to help him, you need to ask him, several times if necessary, what he's thinking about when he's doing this back and forth. Is he just too tired to hang out ? Does he feel like he's not worthy of you ? Does the depression makes him unable to feel anything, including love ? You can't help him if you don't know what's hurting him.

bipolar,f2sdvso,t3_de4eyb,1570381839.0,"I get the same feeling, it's hard to give up on the day. Here are a couple suggestions of strategies.

- If I'm in bed and can't sleep because I feel as I should do something more important, instead of wasting hours feeling that way, I decide to do something. Something quick and small, like cleaning up a bit, putting stuff in the laundry... And then go back to bed. The feeling of having just done something helps.

- If I can't make the decision to go to bed and instead am wasting my time doing nothing on reddit, I try to be conscious of the fact that right now I am wasting time. And if I go to sleep now, I will get up earlier, and my time will be better used tomorrow morning instead of now since I'm not currently doing anything really.

- Browser add-on that limits your time on time-wasting websites. You can set it to block certain sites after a certain hour. I've found that the screen telling me ""alright that's enough' is enough to jolt me out of this state of mind when you're trapped on time-wasting websites.

- Use an alarm in the morning. Get up everyday at the same time. This by itself will not be enough to help you go to bed, but once you're in bed, it will help you fall asleep more quickly and will avoid marinating in your thoughts for hours.

Good luck."

transvoice,ey2gh73,t3_cv6ddy,1566738735.0,"Hi, transmasc enby with no T here. I'm not a professional and my voice is neither great nor passing but I've made some progress so... here's my experience. I try to warm up my voice every morning and do a few minutes of exercise every day. First thing I did was to play with my vocal cords by just saying vowels, just do ""aaaaaaah"" trying to go higher or lower, to gain control.


Tip : don't exercise while laying on your belly on your bed, this will make you raise your chin and make it harder. Have your chin in its natural position or tucked down.

Other tip : don't strain your voice trying to go too much low for too long. Just a few minutes a day is good. If I strain my voice I reverse to my natural voice for a few days afterward :(

Then I tried reading stuff in a low voice and noticed that I had trouble doing the vowel A as in cat for some reason. So I spent some time just pronouncing vowels. I also put my hand on my throat and tried to consciously lower my larynx and feel it move between my fingers. Then I went back to reading stuff or talking to myself. In the evening I like to summarize out loud what I did today, I find it easier than trying to find something to say. I also sing stuff by male singers.  I found it easier to speak quietly first and then try to add power to speak in a normal volume. I frequently record my voice and play it back so I can get feedback and adjust.

Now a typical daily exercise for me is something like : first, do ""aaaaaa"" going high and low, to warm up and find my pitch. Then do just vowels ""aaaa. uuuuu. eeeee. ooooo."" etc. Then narrating my day, or reading something for a couple minutes. Then maybe once a week I record myself and play it back to hear it + measure the pitch, to see progress. Sometimes for a couple day I just can't go low for no apparent reason and then it comes back. It's very mysterious :/

For me the hardest thing was to listen to my first recordings, where I sounded super dumb, and not stop there and then. Progress is slow. And then at some point, maybe six months after starting, I was in a call with a friend and went from my normal voice to ""hey, check out my voice training !"" in low voice. My friend was like ""Oh my god, wow !!!"" and it's been easier since.

After that episode I tried to go low when speaking in public. It's another difficulty to remember your voice during the day. Now frequently when I speak I interrupt myself to do a ""mmmmmmh"" to go back to low, before resuming speaking. I also tend to do that ""mmmh"" before starting to speak.

I think it's been nearly a year since I started training. I went from a very high girly voice to a low voice for a woman, and I get a ""did you catch a cold ?"" from time to time. According to apps to measure your pitch I'm tipping my toes in male range but it doesn't sound male. I've been trying to gather courage to see a speech therapist, cause I feel like I can't make anymore progress on pitch and there's other parameters I don't grasp at play here.

Hope any part of this rant will be somewhat helpful to you."

Like when in the middle of a day you think ""ah, this is exactly like last night's dream"" but you don't remember the dream."

AskReddit,et5vdym,t1_et5rzug,1562492015.0,"There's a lot of movement happening in your rectum to help shape your poop. Your typical poop will make a few back and forth and some rotations before it comes out as a nice log. Those movements are not designed to work with solid objets. The object can go sideways and get stuck, or it can go up due to the ""back and forth"" motions and never go back down. Rule of thumb : if you can't get it out yourself with your fingers don't wait and hope it will come out by itself."

traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,et1xvjf,t1_et0meji,1562406320.0,This is french sign language so I don't know how it differs from american sign language. Woman is your index against your cheek going down. Man is your index and thumb around your mouth going sideways like a mustache. For NB I start at the cheek like for woman and then go sideways. I basically do the two signs together.
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,esyy58w,t1_esycbo0,1562351756.0,That's so cool. In my sign language class I asked the teacher if there was a sign for non-binary and since they didn't know one and the only dictionary didn't either I made one up on the spot. It's nice to see a cross section of different minorities.
TransyTalk,esy4hk0,t3_c9dkgy,1562338893.0,"If you have a similar problem in another community later on, why not ask someone here if they might lend you a picture ? The only thing you did wrong here was not ask your friend's permission. Using a fake picture on the Internet to protect your own peace if not wrong in my book.

I'm AFAB and look like a girl, I'll be happy to lend you pics if you ever need them !"
theocho,esef6eh,t1_esbgaee,1561896396.0,"It would make sense, but I don't think there's enough generations for that. Even if there was a genetic component it would be drowned in the cultural and socioeconomic stuff, as you said yourself."

I can't pretend I understand you, I only have bipolar, but I can at least say that mental health is very difficult to get ahead of. My PM (and discord if you want) are always open. Take care."

bipolar,es5wrdn,t3_c619yq,1561632213.0,"Yep. I call this mood : '???'. It's in my mood tracking app. It's difficult to fix because it's difficult to even realize that I'm not feeling good. Thankfully I have awesome friends who know about this and when they ask me how I am today and I answer ""dunno"" they tell me to go eat something or tidy up and that usually fixes it. https://youfeellikeshit.com/ helps too, even when I don't feel like shit."

MadeMeSmile,eruotau,t1_eruohwf,1561291501.0,"Intersex is when your physical characteristics don't fall into the male/female binary. For example you can be born with genitals that are half penis half vagina.

Asexual people don't like sex. It's an invisible minority so they don't get as much dangerous shit at the other letters but being an invisible minority comes with it's own hardships. Like being told you don't exist and don't deserve some recognition."
