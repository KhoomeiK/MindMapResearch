bipolar2,fmh7y6d,t3_fv078a,1586069776.0,"Hey! I am also just starting on my road to finding the best medication. Similar story, I first was diagnosed with depressions and tried an ssri but got hypomanic from that. I just started a few days ago with Lamotrigine, so far doing good but it's a bit too early to tell.. 

What I wanted to tell you, maybe don't give up on feeling better than you do now, if you feel like ""is this how life is going to be?"" It hints to you being (still) depressed and thus the meds not working properly.. I am no doctor or expert of course but I think you deserve it to find out what works best for you.

I chose to try lamotrigine first because the side effects (like feeling numb) are not that bad, it only protects against depression not hypomanic episodes which was for me a huge plus. 

I really hope you find your way."

Sick is shelter.  
You're sick, they say. You don't have to do this,   
You don't have to cope.   
Sick is stepping silently out of the circle of trying to the point of exhaustion.  
Sick is cutting it all off through fear: grades and careers and even dreams you once grasped tightly  
Because you're scared you won't reach them   
And the only way that one can be done without guilt   
Is to escape into 'sick' and be physically unable,  
but it all comes at a price:  
and the worst thing is,  
it is one people time and time again are willing to pay.

maybe it helps you too :)"
