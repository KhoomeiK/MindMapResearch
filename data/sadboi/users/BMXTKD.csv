Unlike in hockey, basketball, and college sports, what goes on in the core cities might as well be in a foreign country to these fans.  For example, an issue that's peculiar to the city of Denver would be more likely to be addressed by the Denver Nuggets, since most fans of the Denver Nuggets live close to Denver, while any issues that are of a concern to the Rocky Mountain region would be recognized by the Denver Broncos, since they're more of a regional team.

I find that hard to believe.  I've been watching football for 30 years.  If you don't go for it at halftime and you're at the opposing side of the field, or if you're tied at the end of the game and you're on the opposing side of the field, you're usually booed.  Because kneeling is considered a sign of giving up.   You can frame it however you want to frame it, but if you kneel, the down is over.   The defense can't tackle you.  If they do, it's considered an unsportsmanlike conduct and they're given a 15 yard penalty.  

""and the Cousins play was seen as a brainfart but not weak, 

Trust me, it was considered weak.   You don't kneel when you're 20 yards from your end zone.   He brainfarted because he was afraid of the pass rush.  He's not a mobile quarterback.  He was about to get blown up on that pass rush.   

""so nobobdy who's watched the NFL in the last half century should be confused about its usage.""

If what you said is true, then fans don't boo coaches who don't go for it with :10 left on the clock and good field position.   They do, and it's not uncommon.   

You're talking about a bunch of fans who don't live in areas where police brutality is much of an issue.  They don't see ""police brutality"".  Your average fan of a random team doesn't live in the core city of said team.  There are more Chiefs fans in places like Ozark Springs, Missouri than there are in Kansas City.  There are more Bears fans in places like Pyramid Plains, Illinois, than there are in Chicago.  NFL teams are usually regional affairs, and as such fans from places where white on black police brutality matters as much to them as kangaroo poaching.   Their entire lives are literally football and their jobs.   They don't see ""Person protesting police brutality"", they see ""Person quitting and protesting the American flag"".    
Different cultures interpret different nonverbals very differently.   One of his flaws was not understanding the #1 rule when you're trying to get a message across: universality.

  Which is why Disneyland ride ops point with an open hand instead of 1 finger.  It's considered a vulgar gesture to point with 1 finger in some cultures.  And with football culture, it's considered a sign of submission to kneel.   


""Even if that was the case I'd assume anybody that judges the actions of a player in two completely different contexts (one on the field during regulation, the other pregame during a national anthem) is severely mentally disabled because what a fucking leap to make. I don't need to look back in r/nfl cuz I was there and the reasoning was usually some stupid shit along the lines of how it's disrespectful to the troops (even though it was a Green Beret that suggested kneeling to Kaepernick) or that these players need to keep politics out of sports (even though athletes, especially black athletes, have been incredibly political for a long time.""

You're talking about people who probably never left their county line before.  Also, the Green Beret should have shown more discretion.   There were many people saying ""You only take a knee when you're giving up"".  I was there around r/NFL.  I have the downvotes from r/NFL to prove it.   

I'm saying personally, I would have made it as non-football related as possible.  It's football.  People associate kneeling with ""I'm giving up"" in football.  It's a part of the game.  You kneel because you don't want to risk injury.   You can claim ""Kneeling isn't a sign of giving up"" all you want.   That's why when you kneel, the play is considered over.  You can't tackle a kneeling player.   You're telling the defense ""I surrender"".     

""Hello Bill Russell, Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, etc.).""

They did their research first before they did their protests.   If you put your fist in the air in basketball and football, you put your fist in the air.  If you put your fist up in boxing, it's seen as grandstanding.  If you twirl your arms in football and basketball, some might think you're mocking an official.   Again, universality.   You want to get your message across as clearly and unambiguously as possible.  

""You've either gotta be a troll or Reed Richards because your defense is the biggest fucking stretch I've ever seen.""

Speaking about stretching, it takes a VERY long stretch to say ""BMXTKD approves of lynching because he thinks NFL fans from rural areas may interpret kneeling as a sign of weakness, because they associate kneeling in football with giving up.""   

This is like r/stormfrontorsjw style fundamentalist thinking.  

But I will give you this, you actually know your ball, unlike these other offended folks who are probably going on wikipedia looking up the rules of football as we speak.  Too bad they didn't do it BEFORE they posted, LMAO."
LeopardsAteMyFace,fq6tb8i,t1_fq6raed,1589137577.0,"The history is, some people got the wrong message with the kneel, due to it being similar to a play where the offense simply says ""it's not worth playing the game at a normal pace because it will increase injury.""

[Except they also kneel before the half to avoid injury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAYDDVzqOTo)

This particular kneel was considered highly unusual because they were in deep into enemy territory and they could have scored.  

You could also hear the announcers talk about how Kirk Cousins ""gave himself up"".   

You're an Eagles fan, and you also don't remember this game?"

LeopardsAteMyFace,fq6krrj,t1_fq5wn6u,1589133421.0,"Traditionally, the victory formation was seen as ""weak"".  Teams before the Miracle at the Meadowlands seldom kneeled, since kneeling was seen as a sign of giving up.  They used to call simple dive and belly plays before Czonka fumbled.  Now, they just kneel.

 Kneeling=""please don't tackle me"".  When I played football with my friends, I kneeled whenever I saw a blitz coming and I didn't to risk injury by trying to leg out a busted play that would likely cost my team yardage or risk a turnover.   

  It was too ambiguous and too many football fans saw it as a sign of cowardice.  I should know because I'm also a poster on r/NFL.  During the 2016 season, many fans criticized him for kneeling, because they mistinterpreted it as ""a sign of weakness"".  

If I were in Kaep's shoes, I'd simply face away from the flag, which is what I do whenever I attend a football game to protest these modern day lynchings.   Which is what football fans do.  Attend football games.   I also agree with his message, but I think his manner of protesting was a bit too ambiguous, due to the nature of the game. 

 It would be like putting up the black power fist gesture at a boxing match.  It's too ambiguous.  People might think it's a premature victory stance rather than a protest, and people might be distracted by the motion rather than the message."

LeopardsAteMyFace,fq5pgza,t1_fq5kz9b,1589113729.0,"It's because in football, when you kneel, you're essentially quitting.  

Ever seen a football game near the end of halftime or near the end of the game?  If a team has the ball and they don't want to risk a turnover at the end of the half or at the end of regulation time, they kneel. 

To many football fans, kneeling is seen as cowardly.  You're at your own 45 yard line, and instead of trying to extend your lead at halftime or to break a tie in the 4th quarter, you kneel."

They censored a Christian today because he was sarcastically telling a person who said he hated Christians that he absolutely hated Christians, and then showed him a picture of a cross on his mantle.   he also said that he couldn't hate white Christians because he was a member of a denomination that was mostly White.   He said that in a sarcastic manner too.

They zucced his other account too.   

It's either they're using bots or Indian people with no understanding of American racial and religious politics or sarcasm are running the show right now."
