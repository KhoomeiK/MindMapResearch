CasualConversation,fna3y5g,t3_g0k44p,1586790564.0,I feel like the universe can tell when I'm starting to let my guard down and just then it swoops in with something awful to make sure I never start thinking that things might be ok.
depression,fjc9bz0,t3_fcoqsb,1583212247.0,"I think even if we are living in a simulation, it doesn't change any single thing about how we experience things so it doesn't really make a difference to me. We're in a simulation: ok, I still have to breath and eat food or I'll die even if that just means that my programming requires me to digitally absorb pixels or whatever or I'll be deleted. Same difference."
depression,fj758j0,t3_fbx9nl,1583086734.0,I feel like I don't deserve credit for doing something normal people are able to do every day. Like it shouldn't be special when I put gas in my car without having a panic attack.
depression,fj74y5v,t3_fbwz86,1583086567.0,I think it's sweet you're anticipating her needs. It's not the only thing you're doing to address the issue but sometimes the little things can help make the bigger things easier.
depression,fj749qg,t3_fbwhcp,1583086159.0,"I can't think rationally. Like I ""know"" I shouldn't think I'm a burden to everyone but I do still feel that way. It makes me convince myself that I actually am just a piece of shit and that thinking that I'm not is really just disingenuous. 

Actually, I feel really bad right now saying that this is a lie depression tells me because I am really very sure that I am shit for real. Believing otherwise would be delusional given how much I suck."
Anxiety,fj1ck1b,t3_faz1uo,1582917252.0,I hear ya. I can ruin an entire week just thinking about some small task I have to do in 5 days that will end up taking 2 minutes.
AMA,fizoeoo,t1_fizntl5,1582868736.0,Thank you very much. That actually makes me feel better. I appreciate you listening to a total stranger.
AMA,fizn8w0,t1_fizmwis,1582867669.0,This is my alt I use when I'm very depressed so I get all my worst feelings out it with it. I do feel that way a lot. I know it's not my fault but I couldn't keep my baby safe and I feel like a failure.
AMA,fizm7wu,t1_fizljs4,1582866771.0,"His name was Adrian. He was so funny. He thought the word ""poop"" was the funniest thing in the world and when he playing Batman, he said he would ""poop on the bad guys heads"". But he was very mature for his age too. He knew all about his feeding tubes and he so cognizant of keeping them safe when he scooted around. The first brain surgery took away his ability to walk in his own but he scooted everywhere on his little butt. We didn't tell him when we knew he was dying because we didn't want to scare him but I think he knew. He told us so many times in his last weeks that he knew we loved him. This tiny child knew it was important for us to know that he knew how loved he was."
AMA,fizlf7s,t1_fizl0cv,1582866106.0,He was really special. He was born on New Year's day and I thought it was because he was destined for something special. And I guess he was but this is not what I had in mind. Thanks for listening.
AMA,fizktbh,t1_fizkcax,1582865599.0,"He was having headaches and vomiting for several weeks. He kept getting prescribed antibiotics for an ear infection but when his balance became off, we took him to the children's hospital ER in our city. He had an MRI the next morning that showed the tumor."
AMA,fizkovl,t1_fizk9kh,1582865495.0,"He's had some problems but he's coping ok. He's having some problems at school because he gets overwhelmed easily. He does go to therapy. He's so sweet and in general is a very happy kid but he talks about missing his brother all the time. They were just 2 years apart so he doesn't even remember a time before his brother was in his life. I feel worst for him, losing his best friend for life. He'll feel that forever - when he graduates from the school his brother was supposed to go to, when gets married and his brother isn't there to be his best man. I'm sad for him."
AMA,fizk8z7,t1_fizjrpx,1582865134.0,"Not great, honestly. I already depression and anxiety before he got sick. I can barely leave my house right now.   I don't have a lot friends but the people I do have are very supportive. I'm trying."
AMA,fizjm4d,t1_fizj0gc,1582864620.0,Basically just bad luck. He had ETMR which is an extremely aggressive pediatric brain tumor. He was born with the cells that would develop into cancer but we couldn't have known then. They don't really know the cause of this cancer but it's most likely just a random genetic copying error.
AMA,fizjebi,t1_fizj30q,1582864449.0,He was 2 and a 1/2 when he was diagnosed and he died just a couple weeks before his 4th birthday. His favorite thing in the world was playing with his older brother. They were absolutely best friends. He also loved superheroes and watched a lot of Lego Batman and TMNT. He wanted to be cuddled all the time.
AMA,fizj58a,t1_fizivvf,1582864246.0,Thank you. I'm really sad that the world doesn't get to know what amazing things he would have done. He was so smart and so loving.
AMA,fizizp6,t1_fizinhl,1582864125.0,Pretty great really. We've been through this horrible tragedy together and we feel like we can understand each other better than anyone else in the world. I'm very glad to have that at least.
AMA,fizihpx,t1_fizhooq,1582863734.0,I'd like to do that eventually but I'm not there yet. He just died about 3 months ago.
AMA,fizgigf,t1_fizg6mb,1582862224.0,The only way in my son's case. He had an extremely aggressive brain tumor and nothing we did could stop it.
AMA,fizgg59,t1_fizg0bt,1582862177.0,"I'm sorry to hear that about your friend. I've come to learn there's a lot of children dying from cancer.

I range from kind-of-ok to not-ok-at-all. Tried a support group but that was a bust. If I didn't have my older child, I don't think I'd be here still. I already had depression and anxiety before all this so it's not gotten any better."
AMA,fizfsbm,t1_fizf9y5,1582861692.0,"God, everything. He had this crazy laugh that made him sounds like a mad scientist in a movie. He loved superheroes but he always made the bad guys decide they wanted to be good guys so everyone could be friends. He was more empathetic than any adult I've ever met and he worried about us during his cancer treatment more than he worried about himself."
GriefSupport,fiqp9b0,t1_fiq6mee,1582649100.0,They weren't very supportive to begin with as you can imagine. I thought it might help but it made everything much worse actually.
depression,fi0sz3t,t3_f5sx1t,1582044149.0,"I've been there too, friend. When I'm primarily depressed, I eat and eat and eat. Don't shower. Barely can do basic hygiene. I just don't care. Gained 60 lbs.

The past year, my anxiety has been off the charts because of an extremely stressful illness in the family and I just can't eat anymore and now I've lost 70+ lbs and am dangerously close to underweight. I'm going to die this way."
Anxiety,fi0h3n0,t3_f5r0ks,1582036834.0,I frequently throw up when my anxiety is bad. Makes it worse to go out in public when I'm afraid I might just freak out and puke everywhere.
AnxietyDepression,fhy8my9,t3_f5d57t,1581970889.0,"I always think my spouse hates because of course they do, I'm a piece of shit. And then they get sad because I don't believe they love me and then I think, ""there that just proves what a piece of shit I am"" and the cycle continues."
