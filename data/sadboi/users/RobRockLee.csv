So the theory is that if you are always ruminating on the dangers and hypotheticals in your head you can't concentrate on what's in front of you...

Anyway I've been on a low dose of Prozac for 1 month now. I do feel much better with my mood and ability to just have a good time.

Also, I know what a playbill is but what does the rest mean? I don't think people would be inspired to figure it all out."
ClipStudio,fgh6hxu,t1_fggw5at,1580777844.0,"I was going to say the same thing. If it's important to you just use the Eyedropper tool, sample and save each color."
ClipStudio,fggoce2,t1_fgge8fj,1580766038.0,"I totally get it. I'm an illustrator, just spent a bunch on a iPad pro. but it turns out, its just one of the tools in the arsenal, along with my sketchbook and other ""analog"" materials. 

I was thinking about this after posting. Like ""Why paper first, though?"" It's because drawing is about being able to make a million little quick decisions and committing to them. so you need to be without unnecessary restraints. Restraints like wondering what all these tools and features are in this new app I'm trying to learn. There's no wondering ""where do I find the blaw blaw blaw tool?? Better get back onto Youtube!"" when it's just you and a pencil and paper. 

have fun with it!"
ADHD,fggggi6,t3_ey6nly,1580761362.0,Is it recommend to quit drinking coffee when starting meds? I wonder if headaches could be related to that. or is it just a common side effect?
ClipStudio,fggd53d,t3_eycatu,1580759362.0,"It's an interesting point you make and I get being impatient to get to where you want to be. I've been there. Let me ask you this though. Your first day of learning to drive did you get behind the wheel of a car and head straight onto the freeway? It's OK to take a breath, swallow your pride a bit and start the right way.

Start on paper. At least you'll learn what tools Clip studio is trying to emulate.

That said, you learn to draw by drawing from real things, creatures and people  around you. draw things that are basic shapes like balls and boxes. It's important to draw from 3 dimensional things that exist in space, in front of you. Not from photos or other people's drawings. Not to say those things don't come in handy as artists learn but the most important thing is to start learning to see things 3 dimensionally and translate what you see onto a 2 dimensional surface.

Check out books, tutorials, etc. about perspective sooner rather than later. its not ""just for buildings"" perspective plays into everything (representational anyway) we draw.

keep practicing!"

ClipStudio,fgehigf,t1_fgee8j7,1580699631.0,"I see. Yes, she may be missing something. tell her to use the tool that looks like a bucket pouring out paint. you just click in an area of the drawing and it colors it in automatically. no need to color by hand for such a flat look."
ClipStudio,fgebdkq,t3_exz1u1,1580695703.0,"Is she using the paint bucket tool or....painting it in by hand? it shouldn't take very long to drop these colors in. Make sure the line art is on it's own layer and set it as the ""reference layer"" (The little lighthouse) icon. then she can drop colors onto a separate layer, pretty easily."
ADHD,fgdxb05,t1_fgdtyd2,1580688001.0,"Yeah the idea of sitting in an office, cubicle...those fluorescent lights, I get tense just thinking about it. I've even had panic attacks and walked out on jobs in the first week over it. It also gets old, disappointing or clashing with bosses. 

good luck out there!"

I've had a million design jobs. But for the last few years I've just been designing my own content, mostly T-shirts and books to sell print-on-demand though Amazon. It's a hustle that has some interesting pros and cons for the ADHD lifestyle. 

  
Pro: I don't have a boss watching over me, making sure I stay on track with my tasks, reminding me of the big picture.  
Con: (see above)

Pro: I can jump from project to project at my own pace. T-shirt design is especially fast paced, never more than a day or 2 on anything. I tend to get overwhelmed, discouraged or distracted or when I go after larger projects. I'm working on that.....

Con: It takes a long time to ramp this all up to an actual living.

Pro: There's a lot of room for growth and I'm making stuff that's my own. I'm not a cog in someone else's wheel.  

\* I'm currently being tested for a diagnosis so I'm hoping soon the pros will become more of a pro and the con won't be such a con. honestly the way this type of work ""encourages"" certain flighty behaviors and mis-steps, its part of why I started self-reflecting and researching ADHD."
AmazonMerch,fgcup0h,t1_fgcd6c9,1580676378.0,Kindle Direct Publishing is Amazon's self publishing imprint. You can do print on demand books and/or ebooks. I don't have the paper info in front of me but it's on par with a typical book. you can choose natural cream color or white. It's quality enough paper to do nice coloring books on it.
ADHD,fgbmopd,t3_exky46,1580663821.0,Great story! I'm in the middle the diagnosis/treatment process in my 40s too.
