ptsd,fn1yzbv,t1_fn1yea2,1586573561.0,More than a autistic adult male?  No support for adults with autism and no one cares about male assault victims either.  So nobody who is abused is privileged.  I don‚Äôt know what to say it sucks for anyone of any age.

AskDrugNerds,fgl6c9m,t1_fgl1pn8,1580883522.0,"Tinnitus is a Symptom of Depression sometimes.   I definitely have it.  I think you should see a doctor.  When I was your age I was an undiagnosed Adhd, Asperger‚Äôs, depression, anxiety, and PTSD but completely ‚Äúnormal‚Äù stoner.
Weed exposes anxiety and possibly other things.  But see a doctor or find some benzos.  The fear of anxiety is the worst part and the longer you sit through panic attacks and what not the more fear you develope."

If you don‚Äôt then you aren‚Äôt a Christian.  I don‚Äôt care what they have to say about autism their view in the entire world is so skewed that their opinion on anything scientific is irrelevant to me.

MorbidReality,ezifyiy,t1_ezifdri,1567926432.0,And pretty much bled out and cold.  So this kid muddling through butchering a bloody soft human of around his own size was probably pretty tenuous.  I cut up a full lamb once and it was fast and easy but I had the tools and know how.  This kid set himself up for a nightmare.
MorbidReality,ezgjibs,t1_ezfruzo,1567897548.0,I was a butcher and it has a lot to do with physical strength.  You would cut away the muscle/tendons and pop any joint loose before slicing it free.  If he had any experience and a sharp knife the whole thing would take about forty five minutes.  He probably didn‚Äôt and it was likely horrific.  Taking hours....I can‚Äôt imagine how that went down.   Fucking psycho.
