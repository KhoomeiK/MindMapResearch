And then I scroll by this, jerking off to the sister of SO, watch out and hide your mother too Haha."

2 years later I will say I am in a whole different place far from her and I feel amazing and I enjoy my little son everyday without the mother in law. I still send her pictures and we video chat. But its nice that she cant get near us. I wish you well, things will get better. Get some rest mama :)"
relationship_advice,fiufswn,t3_f9uhfd,1582740575.0,"I have a best friend or really close friend. We were friends for 4 years and each of those 4 years he crushed on me hard and we had ups and downs, when he continued to ask me to be his girlfriend. But we pushed through and stayed friends.

Well now I haven't seen him in 3 years because he got married. He texts all of our old friend group male and female, except for me. And I never got to meet his new little family and it makes me sad. BUT he is self aware, and careful with his own heart and the heart of his absolute priority, his wonderful wife. And so I respect that and I just wait for whenever he and also his wife are ready to say hello and spend time with our old friend group again.

I dont text or call him and I just wait.

I saw a comment mention maybe she was trying to manipulate him for her own gain, but I dunno. Cus If she never dated him before, she most likely doesn't care to do it now, hes going after her, and she is probably so happy to see him like I would be if I finally see my close friend again. But even I would like to meet his wife and even have her alongside him if we ever hangout again. Like a fun double date. 

Also I disclosed this friend of mine and our longtime friendship to my husband already, even he is aware that I excitedly wait for the day my friend and his wife come into town again so we can hangout. No secrets. 

So yeah i agree with everybody here, I'm concerned for you. And i dont want you to remain his ""back-up"" if he attempts to make it work with that longtime friend, possibly lying about your existence. That's just not right. And the lying. It's not cool."
DoesAnybodyElse,fik1gx7,t3_f89g0v,1582470427.0,"YES and to the other comments yes yes yes! I'm overly excited, a bit new to reddit and I love seeing soooo many things about me that tons of people also experience and I feel so much less isolated about these quirks! 
As a child I also could not watch stressful parts of a movie and scared babysitters and my grandmother when I would cry through a tantrum or suddenly run to my room and ask that they turn it off."
Anxiety,fik0gbe,t3_f880mt,1582469645.0,"My intrusive violent thoughts were linked with my depression. The screening questions they always ask me each visit include whether I have homicidal or aggressive thoughts. At my first screening with a doctor I answered ""daily"" for how many violent thoughts in 2 weeks. Haha... 
I was a self harmer too, when the violent thoughts came and I of course did not want to act them to any of the people that popped in my mind, so I'd beat the crud out of my leg or face or arms. 
Once I got treatment I was like ""oh...this is better wow."" I dont have a single thought pop in my head. 
So it could just be something like depression."

Anxiety,fi88dnq,t3_f6zto7,1582235360.0,"I know many people are trying to find ways such as yoga and meditation to defeat anxiety. For me only medication worked and it eliminated my phone fear. I had the phone call fear since I can remember! It's been about 8 months, I handle bank and insurance calls, appointment calls for my son, answer calls, everything and the fear is gone and now I understand how normal people felt when just picking up a phone! 

All I can do is reccomend what helped me, medicine did, and to validate you, its totally a real and such a hindering thing. And it's not stupid, it's one of the ways your anxiety manifests itself and I'm so sorry! Congrats on the job ^.^"
Anxiety,fi87g4j,t3_f6x8xc,1582234863.0,"Whoa what in the hell! That is awful and untrue. It's actual chemicals that secrete from glands within us, into our blood that regulate us. I could be describing it totally wrong. But its hormones, it's a chemical imbalance. Sure therapy and yoga and tools can psych us out and stimulate those parts of our mind. But in no way can we just eliminate it with just ""not caring"". And nor does anyone want their extreme anxiety and use it for things.

 I know I'm wishing I had no anxiety so I had more friends of my own to fill these empty lonely days and to be able to make more memories doing fun things, I'd personally want that way more than ""using"" anxiety to ask for help and remain in loneliness.  

And happy birthday! Your anxiety is a very real and difficult thing. Congrats on pushing through it a whole additional year!"
Anxiety,fi48ede,t3_f6ajhq,1582136043.0,"Aah I FELT that as I read it. Aw man... :'( yes I agree with  another comment, that if it's almost as if you are begging to hangout, don't pursue it any longer. And it's okay to just be that listening ear in class of you yourself are also play with that kind of chill relationship.

 If not and you still feel sad, then it could be unhealthy for you and you may need to step away from them. My husband is either an ""all the way' or ""no way"" person, he cuts people off for his emotional health so he doesnt catch himself begging.

 I on the other hand, I totally feel the discouragement and ache but I am okay just being what the person is used to, just the school friend, or in my recent case, just the friend that we talk together when our husbands meet up, like moms when their children play on a playdate haha. And when I return home, she never wants to hang out, and so I had to remove myself from the begging, but i happily am her friend and genuinely accept her at those husband gatherings and happily include her if she ever reached out to hangout outside of that. But I myself had to stop the pursuing. 

You choose what fits best for your health and relationships. I hope the discouragement will soothe away soon."
Anxiety,fi45gzr,t3_f6cyph,1582134361.0,"I threw up on EVERY date, always, even if its the 12th date with the same person, until finally with one person I didn't throw up, so I married him Haha. Things still terrify me, I don't like to go to doctor appointments, movies, or even on a walk. Unless I can take him with me, which is not often he works a lot. I'm so sorry you go through this, I get it and I'm so sorry. Everything I forced myself to do back in school was so intense and exhausting. BUT it did come with this feeling, like ""yes I did it!"" Occassionally followed by a self-sympathy thought of ""wish I could've felt 'normal' while doing it."" Ooh and when I trap myself in my home I sometimes daydream about the memories of some of the cool things I forced my body to go do. It's nice, especially day dreaming about it while safely in my home. 

It will be okay, if you can muster up courage to do something, the feeling during it may be tormenting, but afterwards you have a memory or two to brighten your mind. Or find someone, if you have a close friend, who can go with you that helps you feel less scared. But it's okay. It's something hard that you're experiencing, that people without anxiety never have to push through. I guess rather than advice, all I am offering is sharing my experience and validating your struggle. You are doing hard things and you got this!"
Anxiety,fhqt7yl,t3_f4hsz9,1581810942.0,"I have many palpitations, painful ones too, my anxiety isnt linked to fear of those things though, all I can say is so far I have been doing fine I'm 23, I've had these harsh palpitations since 14. You're valid to have concern for your health, and healthcare providers are there for that care. If you need reassurance and validation to help break your present cycle, then even if thoughts of being a burden persist, go ahead and go to the ER and get seen. And either they find something and help treat you. Or they find nothing, they provide reassurance for your thoughts to hopefully rest easy. 
You can do this, I hope the best and hope for your health."

If we have a family vacation on those days, I tell him my very nervous days will be then. So be patient. I mean I'm still nervous always. But yeah like crazy jumpy, fast overthinking way more than usual and questioning everything (sounds, words from my husband, my homework, everything)"
Anxiety,fhqm64n,t3_f4gg6g,1581806591.0,"I know how you feel, and I am so sorry. You haven't wasted your time by doing those things for yourself. It shows you, that if all others do not understand, at least you are there for yourself. And I saw in the replies, do not let the words of people close to you explain what you feel. Getting help can bring you that validation that you need. My anxiety does not leave me. But when I do those things most days (not everyday because I slip up too) I really feel the support from me. And my belief in my worth still there. You are worth it, you are worth the nice care that you bring to yourself."
