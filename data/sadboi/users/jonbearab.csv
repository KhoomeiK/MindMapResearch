bipolar2,fljjsaj,t3_fp41k0,1585215617.0,"You've been an inspiration on this sub. Ever since I frequented this sub, you've been giving outstanding tips and empathy to those of us who are going through the throws you're going through right now. You generally give great advice and points for us to ponder when you respond to people's posts, and this community wouldn't be as rich without you. I don't just believe that, I think it's a simple matter of fact.

But I'm not going to bore you with the usual platitudes. Yes, this too shall pass. Yes, you'll be feeling better soon. Yes, yada yada.

But the one thing I wanted to gently remind you of is: your bipolar brain lies to you. Read your post again and rationalize it:

> I don't even know what life after this all looks like. I don't really want to have contact with our kids, either. Why have a parent around who doesn't even know what's going on inside their own skull half the time? They would never want to come and visit me, and I wouldn't want to make them. My family used to be my reason to live, but that's going away. I'll choose isolation, go to work, and then be by myself again. I don't even understand me, just dumb to expect anyone else to try.

All lies. I don't even know you; I'm just a stranger on the internet. But I can tell you that these are lies. You're in a bad depressive downswing, you said so yourself.

> I don't really want to have contact with our kids, either.

I know where you're coming from. I'm a parent too, and if I'm right about you, you just want temporary relief from your kids while you sort things out--and that's okay. I don't think you mean this indefinitely.

> Why have a parent around who doesn't even know what's going on inside their own skull half the time? They would never want to come and visit me, and I wouldn't want to make them.

Because who else is going to be that strong foundational influence in their lives? You are a lot more than just bipolar disorder. I realize that our perspective is often otherwise colored, but think about it in reverse: would you want your kids to be without their parent irrespective of their situation in life? Your kids love you more than you are willing to admit right now. Trust in this. Solidarity my friend.

> My family used to be my reason to live, but that's going away.

Don't let it go away. Your kids will always need you, no matter how old you or they are. Stick around for them, at least.

> I'll choose isolation, go to work, and then be by myself again.

I really know where you're coming from on this one. Very often I just want to disappear and get away from all the chaos. This is okay for a little while, but in the end you'll just drive yourself mad from the isolation. Us bipolar folk need human interaction. Isolation is our defense mechanism to a stressful situation. The best medicine against that is exactly the opposite. Stay social, if you can. If you need to isolate for a time, fine, but don't decide on it permanently just yet. Your perspective will change over time.

> I don't even understand me, just dumb to expect anyone else to try.

You have a fair point on this one. Except that I would say that just because we're impossible to understand, doesn't mean that the journey in trying to figure us out is a total waste. If anything, you've shown the people in your life (and who know about your bipolar and other issues) that being different is okay. So what if you have to approach life a little differently? Yes, you struggle. We bipolar folk are with you on that. However, you're not worthless and you definitely have something to offer. I mean, at least that's what I think. I enjoy reading your posts because you help *me* understand me. I think that's worth something. So thank you for that.

----

But... I feel you man. I really do.

> I hate this fucking disease. It just robs everything good from you in the end, down to stripping away anything that you used to hold dear. You can fight it, but you can't ever win, and no one will ever understand it enough to stay with you in the end. Suicide's not even worth the trouble when you're already dead inside.

Oof! Just, oof. The painful reality is glaringly obvious to us in the end. But that doesn't mean we don't deserve to love or be loved in return. Sure, your marriage may be a little rocky at the moment, but everyone needs to be loved and appreciated, even if it's just from your kids.

All this to say, I want you to know that you've been heard. I just wanted to give you a gentle reminder and some counterpoints to what you're saying. I don't mean to be argumentative, rather, that I feel you and understand where you're coming from, but also wanted to share my perspective.

In the coming days until you feel better, just try to do one thing: be kind to yourself. You deserve kindness from yourself just as we all do. Hang in there."

I'm really sorry you're going through this. It's a scary and embarrassing thing to go to the hospital if you're not used to going. At the hospital, having suicidal thoughts is technically okay. They generally admit you to the psychiatric unit if you've got suicidal thoughts *and* you have a plan to carry it out. If you don't have the plan then you shouldn't be worried about being admitted. That said, you may have benefitted from being admitted. If you're just an inch away from overdosing on pills or hurting yourself, then there's a reason for your suffering. You're not making it up. You're sick and there's something wrong, and that's okay. I would take your ER doctor's advice and consider the idea that you could have bipolar (or BPD, or something else). Btw, bipolar and BPD look similar on paper, but there are differences. Keep researching and try not to diagnose yourself ""officially""; let a psychiatrist do that.

The best piece of advice that I have is to take things one step at a time, one day at a time. Baby steps! You can do this. Hang in there."

Objective-C is an extended language based on C, so you could learn C and move on to Objective-C. Java is a decent starting language. They both take a lot of time to learn though. If you start from scratch, it'll take you a few months of concentrated programming to learn these languages, then it'll take you another few months to either learn XCode (iOS) or Android Development SDK development environments. Then finally, you can get started on your mobile app.

For your chatbot, I'm not exactly clear what you want to accomplish with it, but you can probably use any language you want for coding something like that. I imagine it'll run as a service on some server and automatically crawl Facebook or some other social media platform and market whatever it is you need to market.

If you wanted to develop these as web apps, you have many more choices for languages, including Java, C#, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc. My personal favorite is Python (shameless plug, haha). You'll want to learn how to hack JavaScript for sure for anything web app related.

This is a lot of information to take in all at once, but if you narrowed down your goals a little bit we can dive deeper.

Fair warning: programming is not easy. It's very abstract and ethereal. You have to have a good mental map of your ecosystem and environment, along with knowing basic computer science principles, in order to program well. If you're totally new at programming, and have the thirst and desire to learn, and you put in the time to learn and practice, then you'll eventually see your goal through. If you don't think you can invest the time and energy into it, my advice at this point would be to pay for an independent app developer to make your apps, then reap the rewards of your apps working for you. But that is quite an expensive option. Either way, a lot of *time* or *money* will be required.

Hope that helps! Let's keep this discussion going."
