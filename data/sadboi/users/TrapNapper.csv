Drugs,fhkzayi,t1_fhkv21y,1581693610.0,"I've had to quit Xanax twice, once at home and once in rehab. And even with all the comfort meds and support it was HELL. I ended up having seizures and everything, almost died. I have been around people coming off of methadone and I heard it is a nightmare!! I wish you the best stay strong. I know this shit is rough.. you have to really want to recover. It really is one day at a time. Take the first step and find a counselor."
NarcissisticAbuse,fhkxr3d,t3_f3qt6q,1581693095.0,"Eventually after being with my NEX for way to long, his compliments meant nothing anymore either. Every single word out of his mouth was not real. It was all just a form of manipulation and  calculated and thought out. Hell I even saw on his phone he was Googling ""sweet things to say to your girl""!!! Like super crazy. What kind of person needs to search the internet to be able to be sweet!! It just shows how fucked these people are in their evil and selfish minds."

BPD,fawizvh,t1_fawgjog,1576372038.0,I've lost so many friends. It's a huge problem.  I'm like so caught up in this annoying cycle right now and I need to get a hold of myself. I have times where I'm very consistent and very much able to follow through. And then these phases where I'm just not? It's very frustrating and I hate it.

LifeAfterNarcissism,ew2yj17,t3_cmkh1p,1565059119.0,"Shit. I'm going through something very similar. I just left my horribly abusive narcissistic ex boyfriend of 10 years which I also share a child with... He lied every single day, cheated, physically and pshycologically abused me the entire time. I was so brain washed I let him take advantage of me for years. I finally decided to take my life and my sanity back and actually call the police this last time he hit me and got a restraining order against him. He is now going around telling everyone that he did not and basically making me out to be some lying crazy person who just wants to ruin his life... It's so sad and fucked up. But that's who these people are. All you can do is just accept that they will never be what they want you to believe they are capable of and do what is best for you and your sanity and safety. Being with a person like this is hopeless and I don't know how long you have been involved with him but please save yourself now. You are worth so much more... Take it from someone who has wasted 10 years with a loser and get out now."
