But I think it's somewhat wrong to immediately criticize the person believing them, since often it is something imposed on them since growing up. Or  the belief system resonates and comforts them about the world regardless about whether it's true.
You can make your own (lack of) belief explicit to the person who believes but you can't tell them not to believe it by criticizing them. And that goes both ways."
