My random thoughts (and I am not in any way qualified to comment on any of this, BTW):   


Testing has increased, which is great. Although it does make it look like there has been an increase in cases- likely not true. Many more tests are being done in the community and those people are most likely not going to be seriously ill.   


**Over the last week the number of people with COVID-19 in UK hospitals has fallen from 15,415 to 13,168, a decrease of almost 15%.** (This is **great news**\- it means that there has been a good decrease in people needing hospital treatment). And hopefully by next week we'll be in the 12,000s or even the 11,000s.

**NHS England has announced 866 further deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19.**  
**Of the new deaths announced today, 117 occurred on 9 April, 720 between 1 April and 8 April, and 29 in March.**

So the actual daily death numbers can be quite  inaccurate, probably for a lot of countries- maybe the tests don't come back right away after a person is tested and sadly dies soon after, or it takes a few days to get the data to the government. Much better to look at the new cases- that's where you see if the rate of infection is slowing down. They haven't released that information yet for today, but yesterday there was a drop."

This is the kick I needed to change my unhealthy lifestyle, though. I'm going to get my BMI down under 30, whatever happens with covid-19."
Anxiety,fmx6eqy,t1_fmx2ibw,1586459299.0,"Yes, I get the feeling that some people would never be happy with less than disaster. I don't particularly like him as a PM, but glad he seems to be doing better and hope he is back soon!"
Anxiety,fmvy7xg,t3_fj2y1a,1586434788.0,"The City of Bristol, England, UK recorded ZERO new cases in a 24 hour period ([https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-coronavirus-cases-latest-figures-4032314](https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-coronavirus-cases-latest-figures-4032314))

May just be for that one day, but Yay, Bristol! Overall, while it's obviously not great, the UK situation is possibly not as bad as it could have been by now. We are predicted to hit peak within 7-10 days and the new case rate isn't jumping up too fast, even in places like London and Birmingham."
Anxiety,fmtxh2p,t1_fmtwzru,1586380745.0,"Yes. And looking on the bright side, if there is one, they will have learned a LOT from this. If, God forbid, a similar thing happens in the future, the scientific response will be even faster."
Anxiety,fmtx8kx,t1_fmtnln8,1586380625.0,"Yeah the source is terrible, but the graphs etc are the most helpful and I can't find them anywhere else, so it's fine.   
Really good news. And I think so far, the UK overall still has a lot of beds and ventilators etc ready and waiting."
Anxiety,fmtsin6,t3_fj2y1a,1586378246.0,"A team are hoping to have a vaccine rolled ut much earlier than they thought- **possibly** by Autumn/fall of this year, although that's very optimistic and a best case scenario.   
Lets all hope for a best case scenario here!

Anxiety,fmpcrbj,t1_fmpaeq9,1586278525.0,"Yes! The Chief Scientific Officer said in the briefing today that he thinks- although they won't know till later in the week- that we **might** be starting to flatten the curve:

Anxiety,fmo7nfe,t1_fmnygk0,1586248436.0,"I think it's doubtful. Even in Wuhan, with the strictest lockdown, people were allowed out for food.   
What they have done where I live is limit the amount of people allowed in (about 50 at a time, I think) and put down markers on the floor so only one person can be a in a 6m space at a time. Plus they have limited some essential stock- so they won't let people stock up on stuff like gluten free bread, that's 3 loaves per customer so everybody who needs it can get it."
Anxiety,fmo6s18,t1_fmmtf66,1586247481.0,"Yes! Especially if many people are not tested, or had it so mildly they didn't know- I wouldn't be surprised if it's actually 500,000+"

You all elected a great leader. Not willing to stay home and let others do things he is not willing to do himself is real character."
Anxiety,fmilr0t,t1_fmiknze,1586112111.0,"That's what I am hoping. 
Even if only 70% of people have been staying inside... it has to slow down, right? I think in another 5-10 days (when people who got it before lockdown start to get sick) we should see a drop. We have to. Like you said, logically there's no way it can't"
Anxiety,fmiib36,t1_fmi7ljo,1586110133.0,"UK has some hope next week. It will be 2 weeks since ""lockdown"" and hopefully- I really, really hope- we'll start to see new cases start to drop off in a couple of days to reflect that."

Anxiety,fmhtopp,t1_fmhsl6z,1586093202.0,Awesome! I wish the media would report recoveries too rather than high numbers of deaths.
Anxiety,fmhmmkj,t1_fmgsnu6,1586086426.0,"Have it, or have a vaccine. 

So in this case, covid-19 can be caught by person A, who spreads it to persons B, C and D in. store, who then spread it to three people each theirselves, and so on and so on. 

If person B and C have had covid-19, and D has had a vaccine (I'm pretending it's ready), then it stops with person A and nobody else gets it."
Anxiety,fmhmicq,t3_fj2y1a,1586086293.0,"I went to the grocery store and, despite media reports, people were being really thoughtful and following social distancing and not being dicks.
