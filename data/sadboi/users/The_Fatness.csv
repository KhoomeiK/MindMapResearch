My wife works at a bank as a teller, they have gone to drive-thru only, but allow customers to come in with an appointment. They were gloves and use hand sanitizer and as of today she is wearing some DIY cloth mask her mom made, unsure on the legitimacy of it but what can I do. 

I work remotely for the same bank. She has the option to go into self-quarantine and use all paid vacation, then sick time and then go into the negative sick time if needed if you are sick or at risk. My wife has asthma. It takes 1 year to earn 6 paid sick days. So basically she'd likely never get out of the sick leave hole unless she stayed there for many years or would potentially have to pay it back if she left before going even. 

By the numbers only a handful of states have lower numbers than ours, but we all know the rumors about lack of testing. I've heard them locally. I expect our company will eventually lay her off or fire her if she goes into quarantine because she isn't out of her six month probation yet. We could potentially last for 4-6 months if we stretched things if she lost her job as finding anything right now would be silly since she'd be forfeiting her job due to safety. 

Is there any scenario where her staying at work makes sense? I find it so unbelievably hard to make a decision based on anything going on globally anymore because it's become extremely difficult to believe anything you see, read or hear with regards to world news because there is so much misinformation going around. My company won't allow me to go remote if my wife is at home, so I will be traveling back and forth from work every day. I don't see customers or even go into a building that has customers, but I'd still be going into the office with 25-40 other people.

I live in a smaller town, only about 35k people. We have a big non-profit IT/Robotics company here that has mostly military contracts so they have a lot of offices in obscure towns that happen to have military bases nearby. They pay relatively well, but a little less than the two main competitors for those positions here.   

Back in October, my friend who is a systems admin/engineer there with over 10 years tenure, told me to email my resume to his boss, they were running a skeleton crew because they've been cherry picked to death by their competitors mentioned previously. He just now emailed me back telling me they'd (my friend and his boss) would like to sit down with me to discuss a DevOps Engineer position. He sent me a job description, of which I am not qualified for nor do I have experience in for a single part of the job description. I have an AAS in programming and a BS in MMIS and Analytics. So nothing about this I could do on day one.   

I told my friend this and he said they aren't interested in my experience. They are interested in my learning aptitude. I am local, have an interest in computers, am willing to learn and I likely won't be poached from the competitors in town because I will need to spend a good bit of time learning and gaining experience before I am poachable. He said that salary range is at least 60 but could go as high as 75.   

Today, my friends boss asked me to come in for an interview Thursday. I texted my friend and asked him again if he was sure his boss knew I had absolutely no experience and I wasn't about to walk into something to be embarrassed. He said I am the only candidate so far. To me, this all seems too good to be true. There are millions of devops engineers who would fit this bill and be able to hit the ground running on day one. I haven't heard of companies paying people stupid money to basically be an intern in like 20 years. Am I crazy here?"

How far will the CI build get me into maps? Is there going to be a threshold where I will not be able to progress till I switch to LL? Are there any notables in the passive tree that are must have's ASAP? At first glance wicked ward and soul thief jump out as important. I assume finding jewels for the passives nodes on the tree will be costly as well. 

Lastly, I am not very good at making currency. I simply run maps, doing master missions as they become available. I use map fragments and scarabs when it seems appropriate, like high tier red maps, same with chisels. I am always rotating prophecies hoping for good luck, as well as doing chaos recipes as just small passive income because it's better than nothing.

Health Bills - $230/month

Life insurance - $18/month

Trash bill - $20/month

personalfinance,f8ai6el,t3_dy1sqk,1574398024.0,"I'm in a situation that doesn't have a good solution. 

My wife's car died last week, it's now more costly to fix it than what the car is worth. We are pretty much tapped out on finances and are barely getting by right now. She is switching jobs right now and has the opportunity to get a payout of 18k from her 401k. This would allow us to buy a 1-2 year old car with 15-20k miles on it(I've already gotten out-the-door quotes from dealerships nearby), which I think would give her a reliable car for at least 10 years. 

The problem is, we will get smacked hard on taxes and will likely owe 25-6500 bucks at tax time(I've done a pre-estimate on H&R Blocks website). Which means we would actually be paying close to 30k for the car in actuality. According to the 401k calculator I used, she would also be losing roughly 200k if she maintained her contributions and rate of return for 30-something years. 

There's the option of only taking some money and rolling the rest into a new 401k at her new company, which would lighten the load. With the full withdrawal we will be about 10k over the line for the 12% tax bracket throwing us into the 22% bracket. But that means a care with 85-130k miles on it which worries me will be another nickel and dime to death car like the current one. 

We also have an unsecured personal loan which is about the same amount as the used car for 18k, but it has a 9.74% interest rate versus a used car loan which I was quoted for at 3.74%. So the option to pay that loan off and then turn around and take an auto loan for 1/3 of the interest with lower payments than what I pay now on that unsecured PLoan. That unsecured loan has a side by side snow plow that is worth 8500 or so, in a sense you could pay off the loan, turn around and sell it and then use that towards a down payment on a car and a small push snowblower or something. 

I want to sell our house and get something cheaper next year, but we have to wait till we hit 2 years otherwise we get capital gains tax and our house value has increased 15-40k. I've thought about fixing her car, hoping it survives till we sell the house, than hoping we have enough profit from the house to get a better vehicle. But that's a risk and I'd rather have that profit to get us less of a mortgage on the house we find (if we can find one). 

Every option I can conjure up, is a shit option. I don't WANT to do any of them. But right now she is borrowing a car that has no heat and we are about to go into the beginning of the coldest months here. We HAVE to pick something and get her a car. I've made a lot of financially asinine decisions in the past two years and this one feels like it could be the most important of them all. 

We are both at a loss for how to not fuck ourselves in one way or another."

But now that I am on tasks where I need to get stuff on one map to place on another and u only have one  try to get it right or u start completely over. I'm starting to question how I feel about the game. As a solo player, it feels really hard to get anything done. All the guides I watched said start the game with customs, it's the best to learn the basics and learn one map before learning another, I'm just tired of going against teams of 2, 3 and 4 on a map where it's impossible to get past certain choke points when someone holds it."

I watched some ""guides"" and they all recommend starting on Customs for a bit to get your bearings in the game. It feels like every match I get pitted against teams of 2 or 3 and rarely get into a fair fight. Is it pointless to try doing much solo?

Also, I've seen a lot of debate about the sound in this game, every time I think I know where the sound is coming from or how close it is, I am wrong. I really like trying to get the drop on people, but it never works."
