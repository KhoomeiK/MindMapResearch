Especially with confidence, and how wrestling has always been there. No matter, as a child to now, it’s there, bring levity..a reminder to the joys of life. And it seems small too, looking forward to the next Raw especially when you’re down. But it’s actually big in the long run.

Thank you for sharing this.


 Side Atory:

Funny enough, I’ve been inspired by the various promo styles in the WWE that has helped me with my job interview skills. With success.

Like Jericho, The Rock or Punk, be yourself and take it up a notch. Not too theatrical where the employer can see through your act but just enough sell yourself with the best attributes of your personality and try to make each word matters. That includes not playing a a total egotistic heel, haha, and allow participating.

In short:  Be charismatic and engaging. 

It sounds silly but this method worked for me.I was worried about getting “things” right that my personality didn’t shine in past interviews. 

Most likely I’m already qualified if they call ya in for an interview, but the employer is also looking to see if you’ll fit into the company or not. So you gotta play up being a baby face and make them cheer for you."

AEW is trying, doing a good job building up Rose, Baker, and at one point Big Swole, but they may want to consider booking two women’s matches for an episode in a rotation. Beside, there’s always tons do tag matches, so it wouldn’t hurt if there was a cycle, like having two matches every other episode.

Hell, at least call him “Chris Ohno”."

At least it’s not like that."

The key issue is that, no matter what, you have to deal with the talent that guy have, and work with them. (Unless you’re Vince, with His reputation and having almost unlimited resources).

Cornette seems like a dude who cannot work with people, despite his ideas. And if he’s being steadfast and unwilling to compromise..well there doesn’t help. The dude, like Austin Aries, can never keep a job so doesn’t that say something?

The other thing too: this fan is dumb. NXT has the best roster in the WWE and it can’t pull in the numbers. And it’s because causal fans want sports entertainment, unfortunate or not."
