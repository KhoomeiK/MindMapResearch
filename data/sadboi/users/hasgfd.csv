Needafriend,fq3ccxt,t3_ggn2zq,1589065051.0,Goodluck on your journey
depression,fppenw9,t1_fpookzn,1588800898.0,Therapy from a good therapist can really help. Your parents don't share you perspective I get what cutting is for you to a degree I would just assume they don't at all
depression,fpoq8y4,t3_geomjs,1588788792.0,this means a lot for me to hear thankyou your spreading hope for the future
depression,fpoq1n2,t3_geon4c,1588788693.0,"conclusion in my opinion, bhuddists are smart no doubt but they are kinda like doomers who refuse to bloom. life is meaningless inherently, happiness is not garunteed from birth, but accepting that and realising that if everythings meaningless than whatever means something to you has all the meaning in the world can change your whole perspective. life is fucking hard this is undeniable, but if you see the pain the chaos and the despair and choose to be happy despite it then the painful life we live changes forms, and it gains an aesthetic that one can appreciate endlessly, this is all the opinion of a broken person though so id advise taking it with a grain of salt at the most. good luck to your future may you perspective broaden every day"
heartbreak,fpoomr0,t3_geoual,1588788005.0,"sounds like youve come to all the neccesary conclusions but still cant get rid of the pain, but you realise that more than i do. goodluck, id say let this be a lesson or something but you gotta find your own resolution. goodluck im sorry someone hurt you that badly"
depression,fpontpc,t3_geou2t,1588787622.0,i did when i was younger no need to feel alone or weird but id replace it with therapy my guy hope you feel better ill be thinking about you
depression,fph8de7,t3_gd2oik,1588616765.0,"""despair"" may be a better word. you shouldnt get so frustrated remember people avoid being vulnerable but i agree that response is hardly sufficient! have you tried therapy? a good therapist is someone who dedicated years to being able to give you the correct response and also help you get better if you cant see one i understand but search for more open people to talk to as much as you can posting here was a good choice in my opinion because many people here feel/ have felt what you are feeling so they can be a better audience. there is some truth to the statement that being alive means something tho in ,my opinion. thats a response from someone who likely does indeed care but just doesnt have the knowledge/ perspective to respond correctly goodluck to you i hope you feel much better and ill be thinking about you! ill dm you in case youd like to talk about anything more specific"
depression,fph6w5p,t3_gddnbj,1588616021.0,"were not exactly specialists we got demons and things as well which probably makes it hard for us to be direct i apologize you havent gotten what you need its just hard for people to get directly to the point and also to make themselves vulnerable by getting real about things its also my opinion that everyone is very self centered (not in a negative way its just because we live our lives as ourselves in our own head) but if youd like someone to talk to im here i would only ask you see a professional as soon as possible in return i mean they dedicated their whole careers to the notient ""how are you really feeling and how can i help"" ill pm you, you can respond if youd like."
depression,fph5lo8,t3_gd8xtf,1588615372.0,when in the throws of depression i think you get used to the strong emotions even though their negative so when you go back to like baseline you ay not be comfortable with the lqck of powerful emotions but this is not a known fact or anything just a internet conciousness' opinion so take it lightly
depression,fph53ce,t3_gdewdn,1588615112.0,"sounds like ur in the grips of it pathalogical pessimism idk how to change it but i think i did any avice i give should be taken lightly but positivity is a weapon against pssimism idk how it should be used tho im kinda like a blooming doomer not quite theere yet. in my mind im constantly thinking about really serious/dark things but its no longer while im in a state of despair, like im hella sad about all the people were losing to covid and all the stories memories and connections that we are losing forever, but like it doesnt bug me in the same way, for me being positive always meant being ignorant to reality but thats changed for me somehow. its like you see the pain and despair and you just kinda stare at it (idk how to say it tbh). im also fairly certain ive gone insane but idm, positivity for me had to come with acceptance of the cruel nature of the world and the chaos it has, but idk if this would work for anyone who it hasnt already worked for. im pretty sure evryone is pretty lonely rn and theres been a growth in mental health problems across the board idk how we can stop it at all. i think you should probably find a way to see through the bad shit to the good but like i said ignoring all the bad never worked for me maybe just find a way to see both and accept it because in my opinion in the end life is amazing wether its dark or bright because you lived it nontheless, sorry for the word soup i just didnt like seeing a cut and dry post of someone living everyday trapped in a super pessimistic perspective i hope your situation improves and you get the chance to ""bloom"" as the internet calls it illbe thinking about you along the way no doubt!"
