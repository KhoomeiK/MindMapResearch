abusiveparents,fr0t3w3,t3_gly2jk,1589806066.0,"Im 13 days clean of no contact with my narcisist father. It was not easy and comes with severe financial implications. I had to. My sanity was too important. He will never change. I had to cut contact because I was so on edge, everything he cut me with was affecting my health. I couldn't even imagine what he might say next and how much damage those words could do. He also victim shamed me for being sexually assaulted as a teen and adult, ironic bc I have some pretty fucked up memories of his actions towards me as a young(er) female. 

Change is scary and unsettling. When you lived ""home"" your mom provided a bizarre and unhealthy structure, now how the hell do you figure out the world outside her bubble? You make your own structure. Seek the validation you deserve from trusted folks, be it in rl or online. E-friends have tons of value. Seek your own truths. Empower yourself. If you are surviving ideations despite your asking for help and being shut down by the person who is ""supposed"" to protect you, that some true strength. You are a very strong person. 

Based on your original expression, I cannot find a positive reason to be in active touch with your mother. She is not supportive. She appears toxic and manipulative. I'd guess also chronically selfish. That's as kindly as I can put it. 

When I first started studying narcissm, it really helped to read about their toxic patterns in black and white. I found it super empowering and realized it wasn't my fault. There is an inherent glitch in their personalities. And the extra special kicker, by definition they will NEVER accept fault. They also rarely have a sense of true empathy. 

There is a user here, I hope they see this to provide a link, but they have a youtube channel on narcissm. 

If deciding going permanent nc is too overwhelming, take one day at a time, but I encourage you to read up on narcissm. Please feel free to dm of you'd like to chat or if you'd like me to find you specific research. I sincerely wish you the best! Please update!"

From what you describe, specifically narrowing in on your dad blaming his reactions on your behavior, is classic cop out blame. Adults are responsible for their emotional and physical reactions to things, or theyre *expected to* by society. That's why in public if someone makes an adult angry and they assault someone, they face charges. That's why judges order things like anger management or counseling, in addition to possibly jail, because its the abuser's fault, not the person that was assaulted. You are the victim here. NONE OF THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

Edit: extra words"
Paranormal,fqiahhj,t1_fqdg52n,1589393316.0,"Farm land definitely doesn't mean some oddity or tragedy isn't tied to the land. I'm in New England section of the US. Most farmland immediately local to me was involved in the King Phillip's War.

Does there happen to be a family burial plot in what historically would have been the original piece of land?"
MadeMeSmile,fqi90cz,t1_fqi16b0,1589392590.0,Omg Im BAWLING! That was so beautiful.
FreeCompliments,fqi8m9g,t3_gj38l8,1589392394.0,Hey there! You have a very nice glow going and I'm willing to bet you're a great conversationalist. Glad to hear you're feeling better!
Thetruthishere,fqi7cea,t3_gj0z4v,1589391693.0,"I've worked in group homes for ""disabled"" folks and am also close to several people still in the field. We ALL have weirdo stories. A co-worker that was a sensitive proposed the theory that entities will latch to those with ""lesser awareness"".  Similar theory could explain outside type energies in this instance, but you also have to give credit to the amount of residual energy spent there over the years between patients, visitors and even staff. That's in part the soup feeling you described, that residual, ingrained emotion."
EverythingScience,fqhz56z,t1_fqhmwjf,1589387095.0,"I find that to definitely be the trend in regular retail situations at most places I've checked as far as things like oils and tinctures. I use a company online for my cbd caps. The mark up, especially in places like gas stations and head shops is *really* high. Most dispensaries in my immediate area don't carry cbd only products, so I have no means of comparison there."
EverythingScience,fqhygyx,t1_fqhriqq,1589386777.0,Absolutely! They do a better dance together.
EverythingScience,fqhy8zz,t1_fqhx4ay,1589386671.0,"Spin is slang for mixing an herb or tobacco with your mj. I grind them together into a recycled rx mj tube and shake the container. May not be a 50/50 mix each ""serving"", but it certainly mixes. I can visually see it with the more purple or red mj strains. There are color variations, so to a degree you can see them being somewhat mixed.

Edit: changed pure to purple"
EverythingScience,fqhijd2,t1_fqhho10,1589377702.0,"Depending on the strain of cbd, it *could* make you sleepy, so calculate for that on a first try. Everyone is different. I use a company out of Boston area. Wait for a coupon code and buy in bulk. Being in MA, I have a medical card, but purchasing cbd, if you can find it in bud form, at a dispensary is the same price as mj."
EverythingScience,fqhh9q8,t1_fqhekva,1589376967.0,"They are working with cbd, not thc. Depending on what type of strains you're consuming, there could be scant to no cbd in the strain. I spin my medical mj with cbd bud. Stretches the stash and def ups relaxation, pain control, anxiety...."
