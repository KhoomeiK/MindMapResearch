aspergirls,fkurv8u,t3_fkgkxe,1584554981.0,"""Wipe front to back"" makes it sound like it's one swooping motion. Try wiping the vagina first and with a new piece of toilet paper wipe the butt, although it would probably be fine to use the same piece in this case. BUT never wipe the vagina with toilet paper that was already used to wipe your butt. Try reaching under through the front of your body and wipe bringing your hand towards the front of your body. To get into the pink flaps/crevices you can dampen a Q-tip to take out any accumulated dirt/skin oils/discharge that may have lodged in there. 

&#x200B;

If you don't have a bidet and want to feel fresh coming out of the shower during your period, you can bend over and suck some water into the vagina and push it back out a few times. You might have to practice squeezing if you don't know how to use your vaginal muscles. There are different kinds of kegel exercises to push out and also bring water in. Douching is unnecessary. If I overexplained or trailed off your question I hope this is at least somewhat useful!"

DecidingToBeBetter,f3uf2vq,t3_dhzhxf,1571158967.0,"I don't have a dishwasher either. If you have so many dishes that it's overwhelming, shoot for a daily goal of spending 5 minutes washing dishes. You don't have to do them all in one shot. Sometimes it helps to wash the biggest ones first so you have more room in the sink and it will make you feel like you have less dishes left to go. If your sinks are overfilled, put dirty dishes to the side to make it easier to wash some of them. I also like to put my laptop a safe distance away from the sink and watch YouTube while I wash dishes. I minimize the amount of recycling clutter by only drinking coffee and tea, so no bottles accumulate. I minimize dishes by cooking less runny foods on the cardboard box it came in. If I use a plate and it isn't that dirty, I put it in the fridge and use it for one more day or so. Hope this helps."

It's always something - work, school, flu, something comes up. I try to plan the day weeks in advance too. Gone are the days where I can text someone the day before, or even the day of, and get lunch or something.  I always act understanding as to not push them further away.

I am keeping my car powdered in diatomaceous earth for now just in case it actually helps. Yes I will keep treating my cat just in case. The box says I shouldn't put it on myself so I guess I won't. She is getting EasySpot (this is what my vet had on site) and I might change over to Bravecto once it runs out. She HATED the Seresto collar - she scratched at the collar until she bled. I have Raid for the car/house, maybe I'll flea bomb the car if I see another flea. I meticulously shake out and inspect my hair, shoes, and clothes before I enter the apartment building. Since fleas ""love me"" like mosquitos do, I am hoping I can gage the seriousness of this by when and where I get bites. I understand the life cycle is 5% adult fleas and 95% other bullshit, so I check surfaces for flea dirt and eggs. Thanks for the advice!"

It's weird how some people will make it seem like they are kinda close to you but then you find out they are actually an extrovert and that your conversation meant nothing to them and it's the last time you hear from them.

I know what you mean by still being able to laugh. If someone sees I'm upset but they do something stupid and I chuckle, they think they've cured me. ""Happiness is a choice"" is total BS. Do people think I am proud to be on Reddit in bed on all my free time? I am embarrassed by myself.

I have pretty moderate, even severe social anxiety. Anytime someone says something to me I take it the wrong way and get insulted or feel like they are condescending to me. It doesn't help that I think I have some kind of auditory processing disorder, and my terrible memory makes sure I can't remember anything about anyone, so I can't forge connections.

I'd see people go to the dining hall of groups of 12, and I always wondered how they got so many friends. Me trying my small talk never helped, they always inched away, back to their friends. I see what you mean. I'm sure it's hard to find a good doctor that really understands, but keep trying. I need to get some help myself and hope for the best.
