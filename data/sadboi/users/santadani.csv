snowboarding,fqq3pn3,t3_gk9jk3,1589558871.0,I remember when wearing helmets (at least in Europe) wasn’t really a thing about 15 years ago. We had one friend who used to wear one and we’d always tease him about it. On one trip he failed to land a backflip over a fairly large kicker and landed on his head and his helmet split pretty much in half. Dude was fine. But we all stood there in silence and looked at the helmet and then individually proceeded to buy a helmet with the tail between our legs within the next few days. Tough to imagine now to ride without one.

PS5,fqmo7cq,t1_fqma8l3,1589480722.0,"It’s a valid argument, but it’s not universally true. The total system performance is always capped to the biggest bottleneck. In recent history of high performance computing and AI/ML, the von Neumann bottleneck separating the memory and the computation units (GPUsor CPU cores) has been one of the main bottlenecks, especially when all you do is simply multiply accumulate operations. Especially with the end of Denmark scaling and Morse law also slowing down, system architecture and memory bus integration is becoming increasingly more important. Just take a look at all startups working on AI accelerators and neuromorphic chips. All they do is try bringing memory closer to the computing unit (or even do in-memory-compute) to address the memory bottleneck.

I’m no expert in gaming console, so I’m not sure how much this applies to your argument. But your analogy basically says: “a system can only be as fast as is fastest component”. While that is true, a system can also not be faster than its slowest component (simply speaking and disregarding things like parallelism)."
