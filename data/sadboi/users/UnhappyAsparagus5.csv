AmItheAsshole,fhjcb4u,t1_fhigg6n,1581642650.0,"I changed my first name almost ten years ago now, legally for the last two. 

It took a long time for people to start accepting and calling me by my chosen name. Parents obviously took some time, extended family were surprisingly the best! New friends that found out I had changed my name before even meeting them were the worst. Called me by my old one as a joke all the time.

Your post said you changed it 4 years ago, has he been refusing this entire time? If so, at this point I would just stop answering when he calls you by your old name. Comes across as petty but it worked out for me."

I hope tomorrow I can enjoy the game and not get drunk.

We can do this."

If you're able, please report people like this but don't feel guilty if you can't."

AmItheAsshole,fhdo9md,t3_f2htdj,1581493672.0,"Hey OP when you do change your name just be prepared that it takes a longggg time for people to adjust and call you by your chosen name. Took about 7 years for my family. Actually kinda funny, extended family and in laws were much quicker, old friends took a couple years. Depending on where you are it's a long and stupid process. Good luck!
