depression,fn02jz4,t3_fyi7tg,1586534280.0,"I understand what you mean about people talking in a different language. I’m 20 as well and I spent much of a year disassociating and walking through life as if it was all happening to me and I was just watching myself do things like go to work, go to class. It’s terrifying but also numbing. It’s hard to imagine the future, when reality seems hard to imagine / focus on as it is. I think it’s amazing you almost got a degree in biology. That sounds impossibly hard, and it says something that you were able to accomplish it so far."
depression,fn021fw,t3_fyi9qt,1586534008.0,"I agree. I think one of the worst feelings we can experience is pressure and disappointment from others and ourselves. If we have less things we are supposed to do, we have less chances of disappointing ourselves. It’s also nice to just not have to worry about everything we have to do and instead just focus on a couple small things like taking a shower or going to work, life become simpler and more doable"
relationship_advice,fmvdjgc,t3_fxhph4,1586413310.0,"It seems like he resents her for some reason he may not even know. My best friend went through the same situation, where her father absolutely resented her because her mother almost died giving birth to her. The yelling started when she was little and it got worse as she got older, to the point where she developed severe anxiety and PTSD. Currently, the people that she gets into relationships with are similar to her father in which they yell at her in front of friends and they blame her for things beyond her control. Obviously this story is not the same as yours, but perhaps it could help if your husband got therapy and figured out why he treats your daughter this way but not his son."

It’s not something l normally would bring up, but most of those triggers I have to a certain extent so it’s worth exploring more. Thank you for that input. It’s crazy because I just watched a tv show with someone who was diagnosed bpd and I found myself comparing myself to her."

Depersonalization,fmf6fnf,t3_fsk8te,1586020878.0,Yes & it is so frustrating when I’ll not remember who I did things with either. I’ll ask a friend “remember when” and I’m totally thinking of the wrong person. It makes me feel so bad sometimes

hsp,fmd6g2x,t3_fu9ra8,1585960369.0,"This happens to me too. In therapy I learned that anger is a secondary emotion, so it helped if I could try to figure out what I was really upset about. For example, if I lashed out at a family member was criticizing me, i was really upset that they were not treating me lovingly or I was upset they could willingly “hurt” me, when in actuality they did not mean to upset me that much."
relationships,fmd50yf,t3_fujhwh,1585959470.0,"First of all, I’d just like to say you are incredibly strong and capable and you will get through this.
I was / am in a similar position to you and I do not blame my partner for leaving me either because when you don’t take care of yourself it affects those around you.
I think you should look at this as a chance to work on yourself as you said and be comfortable being alone. That has been my biggest struggle and confidence booster so far. The first two weeks are the hardest and this is whej you will grieve the relationship the most, but after that things will start to get easier. Instead of relying on another person, all you have is yourself. 
Some possible ways to cope could be doing exercise / going for walks if you’re able, to focus on yourself in a way that doesn’t strain you emotionally. It could be as simple as yoga or some stretches in the morning / night. 
Another way to cope could be journaling. Write EVERYTHING down. If you get into another relationship, you can use what you have learned now to help it flourish. It helps to get all of your thoughts out of you, because when you’re in a relationship you tell all of your feelings and thoughts to another person you know? You can’t let them all sit inside now. 
Another way to cope, is simply by accepting you will be in pain for a while, but being in pain means you’re healing. I hate to hear this but everyone tells me it gets better and so far, it has. Things are still really scary, after a 3 year relationship I find it hard to learn who I am again, but I’ve used this as a sign that I lost myself in my partner and this is my chance to find myself again.
If you have access to tv, watch documentaries - guaranteed no love / relationships in them. 
And lastly, remember you are loved, by yourself and I’m sure many others. You will get through this."
NRelationships,fmd1g31,t3_frzoot,1585957231.0,"I saw someone else comment this, but this was most definitely a trauma bond.
Too often, we become trapped in our partners “bubbles” where we cannot see all of their faults and in fact they just make us want them more.
I understand your desperation and your thinking into how he connected with you on another level. I have no doubt that this did happen and in his own way he loved you, but clearly does not treat you with respect.
If he can go weeks without talking to you and you’re hurting right now and missing him, the relationship has not been equal. A healthy relationship requires two people to actively work on their issues either together or separately but either way treating the other with respect throughout it all.
I am so happy for you that you have deleted your social media and realized how he put you in danger and you needed to get out of the relationship. Hold on to this feeling if you can. Remember you are strong and capable and you deserve more. Someday you will find an even stronger connection with someone and you will not be held hostage by anyone’s manipulative behavior."
relationship_advice,fm527pr,t3_fstx8t,1585764973.0,"It’s going to be so incredibly hard to breakup. It’s going to take months of you wanting to give him another chance and believe he is different. It’s going to be one of the hardest things to do, to leave him. BUT, you can do it. You deserve more. Not only did he cheat on you MORE than once, it continued with text messages all while being the same girl. Most likely, and you don’t want to hear this, this girl or “friend” could have feelings for him. If you break up, they may very well get together and you have to be prepared for this.
You are NO one’s second choice. Ditch him and the friend group and you will find someone that gives you everything you deserve."
relationship_advice,fl1s03c,t3_fm1ang,1584735085.0,"I am in the exact same place as you, if you see my post. It’s incredibly painful to hear that from your s/o that no one understands. At least he is talking to you while my s/o needs space. I think part of it is definitely how real things get and the prospect of “forever.” You may need to take a break and come back to each other in order to realize the love you have for each other is true and worth fighting for. Please reach out if you went to talk about this, as I would love to know someone who is facing the same difficulties as me."
relationship_advice,fl1qvte,t3_fm1j6e,1584734433.0,"I would definitely bring it up to her and tell her that no matter what kind of argument you are having, those kinds of insecurities are off - limits and in fact very manipulative. I do not blame you for being emotionally distraught. The two of you are supposed to be a safe space for each other to be vulnerable. How long have you been together? If it is early on, I would consider leaving her because it could get worse."
relationship_advice,fl1qbcw,t1_fkzdrl7,1584734105.0,He said he thinks it’s because he’s not happy with himself and that I do make him happy. I don’t think he even knows how he’s feeling. In person he said “I think I love you” but over text it was “I’m not sure.” He’s proven over and over for the past few years how much he does love me which is why this is so out of nowhere. I’m stuck whether to stick around in case this is just a problem with his mental health
