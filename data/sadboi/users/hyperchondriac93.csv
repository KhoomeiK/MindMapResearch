AnxietyDepression,fqc4t3y,t1_fqc26z8,1589250129.0,Sorta! One time I didnâ€™t swallow a cracker right and the feeling that it was stuck in my throat just kinda stayed.
benzorecovery,fp3zbrg,t1_fp3yi2e,1588288649.0,"I tried Zoloft a second time in my life and was nauseous for three days after one dose. Iâ€™ve requested to try Elavil because the side effects seem so minuscule compared to the good it does. 

Yeah I have anxiety that revolves around my stomach and if I wait too long to eat, I get nauseous and start to panic. Thatâ€™s definitely what happened tonight. I just worry because itâ€™s been constant. And tbh if it was withdrawal, it would be an all the time feeling, right?"
AnxietyDepression,foqlewg,t1_foql4et,1587996109.0,Not that I've paid attention to. My neck and shoulders are just really tense and my throat feels tight.
AnxietyDepression,foqkf5x,t1_foqj7ux,1587995525.0,"Tbh now that I think about, I do get that breathy feeling."
AnxietyDepression,foqk76a,t1_foqj7ux,1587995390.0,"Yeah if you have those links, please send them! I donâ€™t have any trouble breathing, thankfully. Itâ€™s just the near-constant gaggy feeling. My neck is tired and tense, too."
Anxietyhelp,fkeelcs,t3_fhzp9n,1584111553.0,Sometimes when my bf raises his voice (and itâ€™s never out of anger towards me) it causes me anxiety attacks. It could be a lot of adrenaline.
emetophobia,fk9bcd2,t1_fk9b95v,1583972578.0,"Iâ€™ll do my best. I ate the entire apple and it kinda burns in my throat like heartburn but itâ€™s not my stomach that aches, just the ab muslces."
emetophobia,fk9aiib,t1_fk99s9z,1583972089.0,I also think I may have an ulcer or something and Iâ€™m gonna start a round of omeprazole on Friday
emetophobia,fk99wfs,t1_fk99s9z,1583971720.0,Like it feels like air coming up but not really a burp
emetophobia,fk99vd1,t1_fk99s9z,1583971702.0,Iâ€™m trying to eat an apple and itâ€™s helping but Iâ€™m still scared
Anxietyhelp,fk8zdq2,t1_fk8z6a8,1583965730.0,"Iâ€™m hoping that the nerves and anxiety will just melt away. Iâ€™ve been anticipating this trip for three months and itâ€™s been hell. I had a bad anxiety issue thingy relapse back in December, a month before I was supposed to leave the first time but I ended up having to delay it twice. Iâ€™m not backing down this time."
Anxietyhelp,fk8d6al,t1_fk7vte5,1583953855.0,Thank you~
Anxietyhelp,fk8d4u3,t1_fk7vqwo,1583953832.0,Ativan and spite
EatingDisorderHope,fk4hmg2,t3_fgagka,1583860625.0,"My stress over this upcoming trip has me so anxious that my appetite has been shit, so I completely understand. Super sweet things are awful, dry foods make me wanna gag, but I'm hungry almost all the time. It sucks. I understand >.<"
EatingDisorders,fk3wep8,t3_fd3sdj,1583847970.0,I did for a good 7 or so years until I got sick again and it all cropped up. Iâ€™m just hoping I can get back to that...
EatingDisorders,fk3w98e,t3_ffv03d,1583847865.0,"Do you want to recover? Do you want this to stop? If you keep purging, youâ€™re gonna have a lot worse problems in the long run. Your esophagus will wear down and it will be hard to eat in the future. Try to avoid giving yourself more problems for the future. Plus purging canâ€™t possibly feel good..."
EatingDisorders,fk3w37g,t3_fgdze3,1583847745.0,OP here: feel free to reply on this comment so I can see them.
EatingDisorders,fk3w1sa,t3_fgbgxm,1583847717.0,He sounds very toxic. Sounds like he cares more about his own feelings than yours.
GirlGamers,fjx1nr9,t3_ff51mg,1583652712.0,I love that movie!!!!

emetophobia,fjrk02b,t1_fjrhq9a,1583586369.0,Iâ€™ll try the bars!! Hopefully Iâ€™ll find something my tummy agrees with. Iâ€™m kinda limited at the moment. Plus I have a five our layover. Not looking forward to it.
EatingDisorders,fjhhy1s,t3_f2a9br,1583348460.0,"(OP) it's important to note that I also started taking buspirone, and I'm not sure if my appetite has increased because of it."
AnxietyDepression,fjdfxnh,t1_fjdcsrh,1583252346.0,Iâ€™m trying. So hard. I feel frozen and my throat is all right and it makes it hard to eat. I canâ€™t stop the shaking..
anxietysuccess,fjd9imw,t1_fi5dpij,1583248683.0,"I started taking 5mg every night at supper, for a week and now I take 5mg buspar twice a day but it never lasts long enough for me. I might try taking a full one tomorrow in the morning. I am seeing a difference, but I still have really bad days."
emetophobia,fiicg4r,t1_fiic77z,1582419645.0,OH NOOO thatâ€™s awful! Iâ€™m so sorry about that!
emetophobia,fiiaymv,t1_fii2gm9,1582419237.0,"If you donâ€™t mind me asking, what kind of side effects?"
emetophobia,fiiaqbr,t1_fiiadtf,1582419210.0,Not legally. Dramamine essentially does the same thing and has less side effects.
emetophobia,fii5rol,t3_f80idc,1582417721.0,Yeah I tried buspirone for a few days but it started making me feel bad too. I MAY go back to Prozac if it comes down to it. Or lexapro. Stuff Iâ€™ve also tried in the past.
emetophobia,fii3v8l,t1_fii1tr7,1582417022.0,"Yeah, once it wore off. The awful thing is, I actually used to take it regularly. But after I had the SB last year, my bodyâ€™s kinda changed and I canâ€™t take the same stuff I used to."
emetophobia,fii01wl,t1_fihzzmo,1582415909.0,I took Zoloft for one day and was n* for three days straight >.<
zoloft,ffwew91,t1_ffwevl8,1580298392.0,Iâ€™m calling today. Iâ€™ve only taken it for one day
zoloft,ffwep8j,t1_ffwenvc,1580298163.0,"I donâ€™t think I can take them anymore. I have an eating disorder, and severe emetophobia. I canâ€™t feel like this, itâ€™s dangerous"

emetophobia,ffv9m6g,t1_ffv9kyx,1580258950.0,Thatâ€™s what got me into this mess in the first place
emetophobia,ffv8ipg,t3_evepdv,1580258214.0,I wanna wait until morning to eat again but Iâ€™m super hungry and Iâ€™m worried itâ€™ll make me feel worse
emetophobia,ffv8duy,t1_ffv84zi,1580258124.0,"And yeah, I know that throat feeling all too well"
emetophobia,ffv8d3n,t1_ffv84zi,1580258110.0,"Thatâ€™s fair. I took some meds tonight that suppressed my appetite and it freaked me out. Could honestly just be overly hungry, that could be why Iâ€™m feeling icky. But Iâ€™m fine now. I took some pepto. I just hope it lasts."
