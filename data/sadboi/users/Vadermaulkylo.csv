My life is fucking pointless and has gone nowhere. And every single time I try to talk about I’m just told I have no problems and am nothing but a whiny baby cause I come from a rich family.

I’m not suicidal in anyway, I’m terrified of death and want to live, but what the fuck is my point? I’m not the sports star and the hometown hero my parents dreamed of when they tried to have a boy for years and I’m 19 with no friends, a virgin and who has never been to a party of even a social gathering in his life.

hiphopheads,fqyea8d,t1_fqy9x0j,1589747191.0,"Long post coming. I’ll just bullet point random ideas I’ve had for a three season revival.

• Harrison is 25 and fairly normal. He works a pretty normal office job. However, he suffers from pretty severe social anxiety and is very awkward. We will find out that it’s from severe PTSD from living with Hannah.

• Harrison and Hannah after season 8 would be revealed later in season 9. My idea is that the child of one of Wayne Randall’s victims found Hannah and she kills him and runs with Harrison. After a while, Harrison decides to shoot Hannah because she was losing her sanity and he wanted to get out of her grasp. He then spent the rest of his teenage years in foster care and claims she was killed by Wayne’s past victim’s kid.

• The first scene of the show would be a trashy documentary on The Bay Harbor Butcher on ID. It would describe Dexter being found as a lumberjack and fleeing and him being spotted out west at one point. That’s the exposition to get caught up. 

• Harrison will go looking for his dad after hearing a killer with his MO is on the loose because he feels obligated to. He knows he shouldn’t but he wants to find his dad again. 

• We will find out that Dexter was out west because he lived with Lumen Pierce at one point. Harrison tracks her down but when he arrives she has been murdered in the same fashion as a Bay Harbor Butcher victim.

• Astor and Cody will be in it! Theyd be close with Harrison.

• At the end of season 9, Dexter will reappear and tell Harrison that he isn’t the killer and a copy cat is on the loose.

• In season 10, we’d learn that Jonah Mitchell is the copy cat. He completely went insane after Dexter spared him in s6 and he now wants to be like Dexter to make up for the harm that his father did. He killed Lumen because he has his eyes on a new target: Dexter himself. And he wanted to start by killing allies of his. 

• In season 10 we will learn what happened with Dexter. He became a lumberjack, but as time went on, authorities pieced together that he was The Bay Harbor Butcher. As his face was on the news, town locals began to recognize him until authorities showed up and Dexter fled. Throughout the years, Dexter became a drifter until he decided to live a life with Lumen after reconnected with her. As years went by, he saw movies, shows and more being made about him. He even saw that his son had been found with dead Hannah on the news. After this, he left Lumen and went back to being a drifter. It is then revealed that over the years he had watched and protected his son. He even killed a foster parent that he saw abusing him. Then the copy cat killer came up and Dexter decided he needed to take care of that problem, and then learned that his son was looking for him.

• Dexter sees hallucinations of Debra like he used to with his father.

• Theres a scene of Jonah and Harrison. Harrison intends to kill him, but it gets emotional as Jonah apologizes for what his dad did to his mom. Harrison then cries and realizes that he’s not a killer, even though him killing Hannah had convinced him of it..

• In the final season, after killing Jonah, Dexter starts to become addicted to bloodlust again. He hasn’t killed in years and starts killing again. This time though, he’s doing it very loosely.

• The authorities are hunting Dexter and Harrison wants to help his father escape.

• the straw that breaks the camal’s back is when a random boy recognizes Dexter and Dexter then kills him. Harrison then becomes terrified and sees his dad for what he is.

• Dexter at one point kills an innocent cop as well.

• Harrison stabs Dexter and then in the penultimate episode, Dexter sees his life if it was normal. Him and Rita are old, Deb and Brian are married, etc. They have thanksgiving dinner and when asking what they are thankful for, they began to describe how they died. Dexter then runs out of the house and sees the world downing in blood. He sees everyone he’s done wrong. Doakes is there and tells him that he ruined his entire family’s legacy and that all they’re known as is the people who were related to the man framed for Dexter. After much more stuff like this, the blood drowns Dexter, while irl, he chokes on his blood.

• The final scene of the show is set five years later, Harrison is married and lives a normal life. He grabs a secret box that looks just like Dexter’s. Inside, it’s a photo of Dexter and Rita holding him as a baby. He sheds a tear, but puts it back up and leaves the room."

Dexter season 9.

20 years after season 8, Harrison Morgan has grown up and lives a fairly normal life. However, he can’t really shake off his reputation as the bay harbor butcher’s son. Dexter is now a Jeffrey Dahmer/Ted Bundy level legend of sorts, except that he’s known to be alive. He was found as a lumberjack 15 years prior and has since been on the run and no one knows where he is. Anyway, kills eerily similar to Dexter’s start to come up and Harrison starts to travel all across the country to find his father.

As it goes on, the twist would be that the killings aren’t Dexter and that Dexter himself is looking for the copycat. Also there would be a twist about Hannah McKay’s fate, it’d be revealed that Harrison killed her as a child but idk where I’d go with that one."

hiphopheads,fqvdlnq,t1_fqvdf4s,1589675030.0,"I mean don’t get me wrong they’re popping for the most part, but geez there’s a world of difference between them and Wayne, 3 Stacks, Kanye, Pharrell, etc."
hiphopheads,fqvcj19,t1_fqvcdv2,1589674382.0,I think nostalgia has done a lot for how his old music is viewed tbh.
hiphopheads,fqvcem9,t1_fqvaw9t,1589674307.0,"It seems like after 2018 that hip hops fans, especially this sub, just started hating EVERYTHING they loved once. Seriously, we have hate boners for: Eminem, Kanye, Denzel, JID, Uzi, etc. 

Just seems like starting in late 2018/early 2019 everyone just became more salty and bitter."
hiphopheads,fqvbz48,t1_fqvbazf,1589674049.0,"Not trying to hate cause I liked his new album but it’s insane that 2014 Future has THAT lineup on an album and now 2020 Future only has Youngboy, Durk, Travis and a couple more generic feature artists."
liluzivert,fqvbtg0,t1_fqvaypp,1589673956.0,He’s gotten better as time has gone on imo.
hiphopheads,fqvbkr1,t1_fqv9w6s,1589673809.0,"But everyone I’ve seen is basically laughing at Snoop over this and making it all one joke. If he don’t like disrespect then don’t start drama with the king of drama. I just don’t know why he thinks he’s gonna come out on top on this one, especially when he’s going against one giant joke here.

And bro I went to one of the worst schools in my state(you can view my history, some wacky stories I’ve told) and nearly nobody takes offense to 6ix9ine and either laughs at him or ignores him. I feel like most of the street people who think he’s toxic or a bad example is ignoring him and not just complaining about him all the time and giving him what he wants."
hiphopheads,fqv9q6n,t3_gkygw9,1589672719.0,"Ngl Fetty Wap’s 2015 songs are overrated. They legit all sound the exact same.

They’re catchy though."
hiphopheads,fqv9llh,t1_fqv8ks3,1589672646.0,Isn’t Snoop like over 50? Surely he has better things to do besides sit here and whine about fucking 6ix9ine.
hiphopheads,fqv66y9,t1_fqv5uw0,1589670670.0,Wasn’t Travis not on it when it released?
hiphopheads,fqv6559,t3_gkygw9,1589670641.0,"I got into Gunna and I gotta say, his music wasn’t as dull and as painfully boring as a ton of his features sound. I dig his music."
hiphopheads,fqv5qgl,t1_fqv4kwd,1589670407.0,Bruh you weren’t kidding lmaoooooo.
hiphopheads,fqv5jfk,t1_fqv4f2e,1589670293.0,Tbh Floyd Mayweather is my #1 so this becomes a bit harder.
hiphopheads,fqv5gam,t3_gkygw9,1589670245.0,"Floyd Mayweather(the song) goes hard as FUCK to me. It’s weird too because it’s not really overly aggressive and is a pretty slow paced song. 

I think it just has an intensity that so much modern trap and hip hop in general just lacks. Idk what it is either. It’s like you can *feel* every final word in the sentences in it."
hiphopheads,fqv4wlf,t1_fqumxm2,1589669933.0,My dawg said he thesis went hard.
liluzivert,fqv4m9v,t3_gl0xm1,1589669771.0,This is really hard but I’ll say CS.
liluzivert,fqv4eki,t3_gl3sqp,1589669651.0,"I’ll be the heathen. 

I’ll say Prices."
