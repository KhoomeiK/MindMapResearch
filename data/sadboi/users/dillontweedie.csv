canada,fmggzgf,t1_fmg9mfp,1586048843.0,My wife couldn't breathe and was running a really bad fever. Had to go to the hospital and get a fucking inhaler but wouldn't test her because she hadn't travelled. They would have tested her if she turned purple maybe. They drop the testing number and the cases go down!? Miraculous lol.
canada,fmggljs,t1_fmfpqe7,1586048585.0,Having Bonnie Henry stand up and lie about cases isn't a win. You tell me how 23 care homes can have outbreaks but yet the new cases are only in the 20s? This province needs a harsh reality check on how lack of testing is only going to make people feel more comfortable when we're in the midst of it getting so much worse.

A huge mental health program is being started at my company and I always try to give some advice. The environment is actually pretty open which has helped me become more comfortable with it all. 

What baffles me is how little people know about bipolar. The hallucinations, paranoia, psychosis, terrible anger and complete dispair it can all be sometimes. Everyone thinks it's a someone who has rapid mood swings. It used to frustrate me but I'd spend my whole life being pissed off if I didn't stop caring.
