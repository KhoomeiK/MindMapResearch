A few questions for you: Is it possible to overdo these exercises? I did the first 2 TMJ videos + cheekbones and septum. Is it ok to do several of the videos in a row like that? Also, is it normal to have a slight headache afterward (to be fair, I had the beginnings of one before I started!) or is there something I did to cause that?

I heard/felt so many pops and cracks during these exercises - it felt great! The back and forth head exercise while holding the jaw on each side will be my new go-to headache cure. I can feel so much more space created in my jaw/sinus area. Thank you so much! 😃"

I also visualize a red cord connecting to the core of the Earth and drawing the energy upwards into my body. I don’t do “all” of this together. These are just a few methods I use. But today was the most recent time I felt this way after grounding and I did yoga + essential oils and root chakra crystals + visualization of an effective Root Chakra during Shivasana. I’ve been feeling especially lost and disconnected so I felt it was much needed, but it’s almost like it went too far?"
