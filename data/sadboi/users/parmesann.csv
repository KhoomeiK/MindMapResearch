badwomensanatomy,fq79iu7,t1_fq76rsk,1589143521.0,"many women are still fertile after 40. they are less fertile, but they can theoretically still conceive a child until menopause, which, on average, is at about 51. interestingly enough, the rate of older women having children is increasing. I, for one, was born when my mum was 40. no prenatal or postnatal problems came up.

men do, as you said, have a lower sperm count when they age. which means that they are *less fertile.* if you have lower chances of conception, you are less fertile. fertility is not just a yes-or-no qualifier, it’s a scale.

my original comment didn’t actually question the fertility of men directly. I mentioned that ageing in men tends to affect the *quality* of sperm. this means that, even if you can conceive, you will be more likely to have health problems with that pregnancy and the resulting child.

I hope all of this makes sense. you can read more about things like this [here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/expert-answers/paternal-age/faq-20057873) and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253726/)."
