So I dunno if my experiences qualify then? I actually had two events that felt like resolutions
1. I went to Taco Bell with a ton of friends from my university. And everyone had such a great time just goofing off, eating random cheap food, etc. In the car on the way home we were karaokeing some song and I seriously felt like a sort of ghost of myself at 14 left me. Like it had been sitting around sad and waiting for things to get better for me and when I had that night it was okay and allowed me to move on. 

2. Easter last year, was also a wonderful weekend with great food and spending time with friends. But when my friend stepped out to do something for an hour I found myself upset. I tried to make myself some food and I just kept thinking “that’s all I wanted. That’s all I wanted” like I didn’t want my family to do some crazy expensive ordeal, I just wanted a time where we came together and it felt like the day was meant to be happy and that we mattered to each other. And I ended up sobbing so loudly for like 20 minutes, like yelling-crying in a way I have never done. It didn’t feel as resolved as the first one, but the emotion in itself felt validated I guess. I had found what I was looking for.
