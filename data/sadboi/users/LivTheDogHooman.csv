I get a dry sore throat too, but it‚Äôs mainly because my ceiling fan is on 24/7 (because it‚Äôs hot in my room). So if you have a fan on anywhere, turn it off for a couple of days. I recommend using a humidifier and see if that helps. Also, if you‚Äôre staying home, washing your hands, staying away from people, your safe. You‚Äôre listening to the rules that helps reduce the spread (if you‚Äôre not, please stay home). I always tell myself that I‚Äôm safe at home. I hope you feel better!"

goldenretrievers,fkb25ug,t1_fkan72t,1584024584.0,"I‚Äôm in a pre-veterinary class and last year we learned about animal behaviors and did rat training. My class learned about all the terms and what to do in some situations. Meanwhile, the trainer was visiting my school with the dogs for stress relief and she started doing a program for girls with anxiety and with a sibling with special needs (my older brother is autistic) so I started training the dogs with her ever since last January and it‚Äôs super fun! To be honest, I don‚Äôt think you need a lot of experience to start training, if anyone wants to start, try getting to know different trainers to get the basics and learn from their experience. I went to training rats to dogs, which is actually the same but different because both animals are very smart."

I became a trainer by going to a pre-vet class and we learned about the different branches of taking care of animals and learning their behaviors. We did rat training in our class and I learned that I really enjoyed doing it, while doing the rat training last year, I joined the program that the trainer was doing and it was nice knowing all the terms and knowledge. This is definitely something I want to do when I want to go to college and then graduate. Also, the first steps is just basic training like sit, lay down, their name, etc. It also depends on the person‚Äôs needs like a seizure alert/support dog or if someone has an anxiety disorder."
