starterpacks,fqtoezm,t1_fqtaopq,1589642940.0,"I have ADHD and I'm prescribed Vyvanse. I 100% have more motivation to do stuff like work on music (I'm a music major lol) when I have the chemical help from my meds. There's nothing wrong with that. That's basically the reason I'm on meds in the first place. The person I am when I am on my meds kinda hates the person I am when I'm *not* on my meds because it makes me realize what an unfocused, unmotivated, mess of a person I am otherwise. And that might sound unhealthy, like some kinda drug addiction, but I'm not *actually* addicted to my medication, like I don't go nuts if I don't take it. My meds help me become more aware to improve the person I am with or without the meds.

If you really think you might have ADHD, it's definitely worth it to look into getting a diagnosis. I didn't get it until college. It is also completely possible to have ADHD and not take stimulants at all - there are other kinds of drugs for it - and some people don't take drugs at all and instead see specific therapists that basically act as an ADHD coach. I know someone who didn't get diagnosed until their late 30s, decided to go on meds, and it changed their life for the better, and I know someone else who didn't get diagnosed until even later than that but still decided ""Well, I've made it this far in life without meds and I'm doing pretty OK so I don't think I need to start them now."" And all of this is *fine*. Just having the diagnosis alone is like having a brand new weapon in your arsenal for life. It's *so* helpful. So if you really think you have it but youre worried about taking stimulants, you can get diagnosed but not actually do anything about it. Just having the information about yourself offers a lot of comfort. Sorry for the book lol I just really like offering guidance to people who think they might have it because it was people like that that helped me realize that *I* have it and it changed my life."
starterpacks,fqtmuo1,t1_fqtdvay,1589642052.0,It....Isn't microdosing though. Taking your prescribed amount of adderall (or other ADHD medication) to treat your diagnosed ADHD isn't microdosing.

It's a deformed dog. You're acting like they said every human being with a deformitiy is nothing more than scum on the bottom of their shoe. Deformities AREN'T pretty to look at, no matter who you are. Stop kidding yourself because you can't confront uncomfortable feelings. To pretend that it's beautiful and cute or whatever to have a disfigurement like that, dog or otherwise, is just a lie. It is uncomfortable to look at for a lot of people and that's not a bad thing, it's just the truth. It would be a bad thing if someone treated people with a disfigurement worse because of it, but I don't see that happening.

And OK I don't have any deformities myself but I've read plenty online from people who do, and they absolutely hate the kind of attitude that the majority of these comments are displaying. It's downright patronizing, because in the end you're just trying to make yourself (you in the general sense) feel better about your initial discomfort with their appearance by pretending you never felt that way to begin with."

BikiniBottomTwitter,fpkreo8,t1_fpj4cwn,1588699723.0,"No trust me, I tried to like it here. My parents both lived in DC when they were in their 20s and talked about how much they loved it, I knew there was a lot of job opportunities here. I originally wanted to go to school in Fairfax county and then later move into the city. My brother lives in DC now and my boyfriend lived in Colombia Heights last year, and lives in Alexandria so I've been spending a lot of time over the past two years inside city limits and the surrounding area.

I'm not saying NYC doesn't have any of these traits, and maybe it's just confirmation bias because. I haven't been in many big cities across the US. But to me it just seems like there's so many people in DC who have a ""fuck you, I've got mine"" mentality that I don't know how anyone lives there. I get stressed from being in public in a way that doesn't happen to me anywhere else. Not to mention it's literally impossible to live in DC cheaply unless you want to have 5 roommates at the age of 28. I think my biggest issue is that, in my experience, people in NYC know that there are a lot of shitty parts of living in NYC and they acknowledge them as part of what comes with being there, but for DC, people (the city in general?) tries to pretend that the shitty parts of it don't exist.

KidsAreFuckingStupid,flae09t,t1_fl9pr3u,1584981995.0,"Yea but to that I would just say, if you don't know where your kid is, you call them. That's why they have the phone in the first place. Before we we had smartphones, or any phones at all for that matter, parents had no idea where their kids were, they just had to trust they really were at school, or at their friends house like they said, etc. And things were fine. When my dad was growing up, my grandma's rules for him and his siblings were ""You have 15 minutes to come home after the street lights come on."" She had no idea where he was all day or what he was doing. Like I realize how old fashioned I must sound right now, but I don't think that you *need* to know the exactly latitude and longitude of where your child is every second of every day. If the concern is that they might lie to you and be somewhere else, well then you need to work on why your child doesn't trust you, or why they feel the need to lie to you. Having the ability to track them won't change that. If you're worried about them getting lost or something, then maybe you shouldn't let them be without adult supervision until they are old enough to confidently find their way home. And so on and so forth. Being able to track their location won't fix the problem of why you feel the need to track their location in the first place. And again, with a flip phone you can still call them to check up on them and whatever. I just feel like literally tracking them is a bit infantilizing, and it stems from lack of security and trust within yourself. Don't push those issues onto your kid."

She had 4 kids, took full maternity leave for 3 of them, and then passed up better job opportunities in order to stay closer to home to raise her kids. Men, generally speaking, don't really have to worry about this as much. My dad never had to take an extended absence from work, ever, throughout his several decades of working, so he makes more money from literal hours worked (he accrues paid vacation days and gets overtime pay) and from any bonuses or other benefits he may receive from having the time to build his reputation.

pointlesslygendered,fk9zee4,t1_fk9y2tp,1583987538.0,"Honestly, if you want to hear my perspective, before I went into college I thought I would be interested in the sciences. I thought certain parts of psychology and chemistry were interesting (and I still do, if I'm being honest), but my interest was never really encouraged by any adults in my life, especially when it started getting hard. Also, my high school wasn't that great and didn't fully prepare me for college. Don't even get me started on math -- I was *never* encouraged in math, even by my math teachers, and I still have it ingrained in my head that I suck at it to this day. I actually wanted to take an intro computer science class in college, but I couldn't because they had a prerequisite of 2 semesters of calculus, which I never took in high school because I didn't have the opportunity, and I never felt inclined to take it in college either because I just felt like I would fail. 

I can't help but think all of this wouldn't be the case if I was born a man. I mean, it's not like I can prove it, but it's just hard seeing basically the opposite happen to the male classmates around me. Hell, my parents even took out a crazy amount of parent plus loans to send my brother to an out-of-state school that had a better program for the sciences, but when I wanted to go to an out of state school they kinda shrugged and said there wasn't enough money, so I went to the school that was my brother's second choice (in state, still a decent school but I think you see what I'm saying here).

 I ended up majoring in humanities, by the way, because when I started coming into adulthood I realized I didn't actually know anything about the sciences at all, and the idea of studying it in college just seemed really daunting, like I didn't feel up to the challenge, or I wouldn't be good enough for it. So yeah, that's just my experience. Not saying it's this way for all women, but I also wouldn't be surprised if a lot of them had similar stories."

When I tried getting into TS2 I just...Didn't get it. The gameplay doesn't feel as natural to me and I find myself just straight up not knowing what to do to make the game more engaging. 

The Sims 4 just straight up had a different art style, on purpose. You can not like the art style, but to say it's objectuvely worse? Things must look pretty different when you're looking down from your high horse all the time."

Your family had money growing up? Cool, your family could afford to pay for ballet lessons or whatever, buy you an instrument so you could play in band, you had time to play sports because you didn't need to have a part time job while in high school, your parents could hire tutors if you were struggling with a subject, you could study abroad if you wanted to, etc. Yes, these things aren't completely impossible if you grew up poor, as there are scholarships, or some schools provide an instrument for you, etc. But don't you *dare* try and sit there and say that having money doesn't get you opportunity, when there are so many people who grew up poor who could only dream of having the opportunities that their richer peers had.

BinghamtonUniversity,fj8qkgf,t3_fc07za,1583119691.0,"Ooo if you're seeing the doctor you'll probably see Dr. Mazzeo and she's absolutely amazing and I love her. She's just really intelligent and cares about her patients, listens to you and your concerns and works with you. I've met other friends and acquaintances here who see her too and they all say the same thing about her. She isn't one of those arrogant doctors who thinks they know everything because they have a PhD. Just be real with her.

As far as I know, they don't do actual testing for anything, but they can redirect you to a psychologist in the area for testing. They did this for me when I wanted to get tested for ADHD. After I got the diagnosis they added it to my file and Dr. Mazzeo prescribes my medications for it now. Although this is probably an outlier because most medications for ADHD are controlled substances so they absolutely required a formal diagnosis before they would even consider prescribing me anything for it. If you are seeing a psych for something else and you aren't formally diagnosed yet, they might give you the meds anyway while you're figuring it out. I started seeing the psych there before my ADHD diagnosis, just for depression and anxiety, and they didn't require any proof of diagnosis for that to prescribe me meds for it.

But yeah you'll probably end up seeing Dr mazzeo (if you aren't initially directed to her I would honestly just request to see her specifically, she is that awesome), and she'll talk to you about your history and how you're doing in life right now, and she'll help you find meds that will work for you and adjust them accordingly over time."

In some states, it is required by law that a property must have an air conditioning unit for someone to rent it. A coffee maker??? That's just cost efficient! If anything, not having a coffee maker is a sign of luxury because it shows that you can afford to buy coffee at Starbucks or something. I know this video is a few years old now, but c'mon, not only do they have to constantly disadvantage poor people at every opportunity, but to just straight up deny their existence?

relationship_advice,fiwchx4,t3_fa6peh,1582781177.0,"I wasn't going to comment, but I saw someone else's comment about how you can be a true gentlemen or whatever to help her heal and I took issue with it. All I'm saying is, do NOT get into any relationship with someone who has trauma thinking ""I can fix them."" No. You can't. You can help and support them, but a large part of getting better has to come from them alone. Thinking ""It's OK I can fix them"" becomes a justification for staying in the relationship when it starts to work towards your own detriment. Take it from my mom - it took her 20 years to divorce my dad because of this reasoning (""it's not his fault he's had a traumatic past, he's a broken man and is a good person at heart"", etc.) and she was miserable for the majority of that time. She stuck with it because of the kids, for one, but also because she thought that if she tried really hard and was a really supportive spouse, then my dad's problems would fix themselves. I'm not saying that someone with past trauma is not worthy of pursuing a relationship with, but you should just have a good idea of what you're getting into before you try, and don't go into it with the wrong ideas.

If you're interested and want to give it an honest try, then go for it. But just remember that in the end her problems aren't your problems, and it isn't your job to try to ""fix"" her. Be prepared to be supportive of course, but be careful not to think of your relationship with her as a ""project"", y'know what I mean? Additionally, there isn't anything wrong with choosing not to pursue her for any reason, or if you do pursue the relationship but then realize it isn't working out for you because you feel like her past is too much for you to deal with."

SelfAwarewolves,fiw8tx7,t1_fiw7yzc,1582778131.0,"That's just simply not true and incredible short-sighted. I literally just said it isn't that black and white. They *only* go hungry if their parents have a mental illness or are shitty people? Just listen to yourself. That just isn't true, and even if it was it *still* isn't the child's fault and isn't a reason for them to go hungry. What reality are you living in that has such clear-cut absolutes? Because it certainly isn't this one."
SelfAwarewolves,fiw6u32,t1_fivxbti,1582776640.0,"Yes because parents buying alcohol and cigarettes is the only reason a child would ever be hungry, there could be no other reason. And yes because CPS is so well constructed and a foolproof system that always works in the benefit of the child and being in foster care is always a better option that always leads to a child having a healthier upbringing free of abuse and trauma compared to if they were left with their parents who may be fine parents in every other respect except for the fact that they're poor. /s

I personally think that if someone can't afford children they shouldn't have any, but it is never a completely black and white scenario. Some people are very financially stable when they have a child but then life happens and for whatever reason (laid off from their job, unexpected healthcare expense, for a few examples) money becomes really tight and they have a harder time providing for their child(ren) that they previously had no issues providing for. Also, even though people *shouldn't* have kids if they can't afford them, people still will, because free will, and also you can't just tell poor people they aren't allowed to have kids because that is classism at best, eugenics at worst. And regardless of why a child may be hungry, whether it's through direct irresponsibility and neglect from their parents or not, *it still isn't the child's fault* and they shouldn't have to go hungry for something that is out of their control. They didn't choose their parents, they didn't ask to be born."

unpopularopinion,fiqf1jk,t1_fiqe2rq,1582642860.0,"It's great that you feel that way. No one has to agree and no one has to act in accordance with your world view.

If HIS (or her idk) parents respected HIM, they would understand that he is his own person completely independent of his parents and their decisions in life and he has no obligation to dedicate his life to something that they caused.

My mom even told me when she gets too old to live independently, she wants us to put her into a nice care facility because she understands the literal *burden* it is to have to take care of another person like that. You can say it's the honorable thing to do or whatever but again, fuck that, you are under no obligation to care for someone besides your literal children (and even then you could give them up for adoption and give up your parental rights but still). If you personally disagree that's fine, but OP still remains under no obligation to care for their sibling and that is a completely valid decision for them to make and they aren't a lesser person for not wanting to take on a roll they never signed up for."
TwoXChromosomes,fiqe5hq,t1_fiph0gv,1582642268.0,"You're acting like every woman is always ""sexually violated"" every time they take public transit. This just isn't true lol, and I'm a woman. There's creeps everywhere in public, not just public transit, and there always will be. Black people boycotted because the public transit system was systematically biased against them, like the actually RULES of the bus, not because other customers outside the employment of the public buses who used the service made them uncomfortable. There isn't much that can be done about a couple customers that make people uncomfortable, except maybe more awareness from bus drivers and the ability to issue bans, but even then that won't fix everything. Like what the hell do you think defunding public transit would accomplish except for disadvantaging people who rely on it daily??

Their brain isn't functioning properly, but that isn't an excuse. It makes you think about the situation differently, and brings intent into question, but the shitty thing was still done and the person who did it needs to face the consequences. Like I don't think the kids in this case should get executed or anything, but they most definitely should be in some kind of institution for a while. You can say that every kid their age lacks full awareness of their actions, but the majority of kids their age aren't doing shit like this.

I feel like this detail changes the whole narrative. Not to mention he killed the other inmate in 1985. Literally 35 years ago. Fuck no this guy shouldn't be executed if that's the case. Honestly, I would have a different view of the death penalty if , when a person was sentenced to it, they were executed within a week or something. This guy had a full 35 years from when he killed the child rapist to when he is finally executed for it. What the hell is the point in that?"

It's not like everyone who has autism is rude, and it's not that if someone is socially unaware they simply *must* have autism, but I'd argue that the observation has merit.

I understand that obviously not everyone feels the same way, but I honestly can not say that I understand why some people literally don't even *consider* it, even though in some cases having a kid at that point in their life could be the most inconvenient, expensive, literal burden on their lives and they aren't fit to be a parent for whatever reason.
