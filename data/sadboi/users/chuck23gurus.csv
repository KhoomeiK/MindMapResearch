ufc,fq6wr1c,t1_fq6k6gc,1589138832.0,Exactly. I’m not even going to bother watching the Khabib vs Gaethje fight. I hope Gaethje beats him the way he beat Tony but I highly doubt that. Dana fucked us.
ufc,fq6wfxa,t1_fq6i2nt,1589138721.0,I really don’t think so. Yeah it was brutal but that’s not the same as Mahammad Ali getting punched in the head for 10 rounds by guys like Joe Frazier for years and years. I’d venture to say Justin Gaethje has more to worry about considering how he has fought up until this point. He even says he’s got what was it now 4 fights left in him?
ufc,fq6vu38,t1_fq61x85,1589138497.0,Same could be said of Khabib fans. I’m not a “fan” of one fighter over the other. Tony is a bad match up for Khabib regardless of the mental gymnastics people want to go through.
ufc,fq6vch9,t1_fq4ycyn,1589138320.0,"That’s not how it works generally. If that were the case then Conor is the only feasible person that could challenge Khabib. Because he beat Dustin (easily), who beat Gaethje. Tony was a worse match for Khabib given the damage he does from the ground."
ufc,fq5vfk9,t1_fq5qami,1589118477.0,It doesn’t matter if Tony lost the fight. If Khabib doesn’t give him a fight then it doesn’t matter if he’s never beaten. His legacy will always have a caveat...”he dodged Tony for years.”

Edit: Tony’s corner that aloud the fight to happen I mean."
ufc,fq5v4pa,t1_fq5qi2v,1589118237.0,Exactly. He didn’t attempt the roll until he was already way to worn down.
ufc,fq5uzye,t1_fq5tq1w,1589118145.0,I literally had this exact same thought watching it. Put a lump in my throat not going to lie. I hope Tony is okay and comes back better.
ufc,fq5uuzq,t3_ggvc9c,1589118047.0,The fight made me sad man. I’m happy for Gaethje but seeing Tony at the end of that and the head shake and covered in blood was just a little heartbreaking. Hats off to both of them. Both are damn good fighters and deserve the utmost respect.
ufc,fq5upp0,t1_fq5bmk5,1589117940.0,Exactly. Terrible fucking long term decision by Dana.
ufc,fq5ukaj,t1_fq4yrd8,1589117832.0,Too bad Tony didn’t hit that uppercut way sooner in the round. Who knows if he would have finished with it though. Tony was off last night.
ufc,fq5ueue,t1_fq50y66,1589117725.0,Same man. I felt so bad for Tony. Not only because he’s much more skilled than that fight showed but also such a vicious beating he just sort of “took.” Even Joe at one point noticed that he would just wait for Gaethje to hit him. It was almost bizarre.
ufc,fq5roe8,t1_fq4ye5o,1589115594.0,"I’m just butthurt. Even thought I like Gaethje too, and Tony’s not even my favorite fighter but man I was worked up."

IAmA,follksw,t3_g7zxca,1587864878.0,"I was raised by an undiagnosed BPD mother. I’m a very open minded and empathetic person but the emotional and mental abuse I have suffered in my life due to her and her condition has made me a bit unsympathetic to people with BPD. I do commend you for acknowledging and treating your condition. For people that are ignorant of it and have not actually experienced living with, let alone being raised by, a person with BPD... you truly don’t know how monstrous it is. I believe those that suffer from it are not fit to be parents unless they are closely monitored. A child’s mind and sense of reality is shaped in large part by their parents. This disease is extremely cruel to children. Children raised by BPD parents are also much more likely to develop BPD theirselves. I also do not have a father so my entire world was shaped by the Waif and the Witch mother I had. Sociopathy and psychopathy are also mental conditions and it’s socially acceptable to avoid these people but not someone with BPD because not a lot of people are well informed on the condition.

My mom didn’t come to the hospital the day my son was born because she was waifing and said “I didn’t want her there” when I had just let her know she had to wait outside for a little bit because they only let so many people in at once. She didn’t talk to me until two days later. I finally cut her out of my life when I invited her to Christmas at my house and she didn’t come because “she was shy.” So instead she waifs to my brother that she had to spend Christmas alone because he lives out of state and I didn’t come to her house. He’s an enabler so he then blasts me and my family on social media. So much destruction she brings to my life. I could write massive amounts here of the examples of her bad parenting. I’ve undergone a lot of therapy to help fix some of the damage she did to me. I wish I had been raised in a loving home. I have nervous system trauma from dealing with her for so long. There’s a subreddit of children who were raised by those with BPD. If you really want to understand the condition and the harm it can cause a child take a look..."

Don’t let them defeat you. You’re stronger than they are and worth more than they are. There is life after rape, you could join a group of other rape victims for advice and to not feel so alone. I experienced a trauma recently that I almost tried suicide again but decided to finally go to therapy and get help. It really did help me... professionals can help you organize your thoughts, give you coping tools, and different perspectives. You might want to research and read reviews first though because I’ve heard of people having negative experiences when their therapist doesn’t have the right experience. You want to know some people who have survived rape and thrived?

getting_over_it,failxk8,t3_e8msxq,1576111052.0,"I’ve been through a lot of recent therapy over a trauma from last year. This was something severe enough that I met with my life insurance agent to up my policy because I started becoming afraid of what I could do to myself. The first thing that really helped me out in those first 3-6 months was my therapist telling me that trauma takes time. Literally. You think about it 2 times a minute, then eventually 2 times an hour, then 2 times a day, then 2 times a month, year, and so on. Eventually the day will come when you think about it and say “I can’t remember the last time I thought about that.” You have to process all of it to get to that point. You’re doing that right now. That day will come when you’ll then think about her with indifference. 

Other people here have given some good tips but trauma is processed and worked on differently from person to person I think. For me writing things down did more than anything else. Oh and just letting myself cry. Sometimes I’d have to watch a specific movie that somewhat related to my issues and force myself to cry.  It sucked and even felt counterproductive but I noticed even minutes later after the crying stopped I had relief. Walking/jogging also helped and continues to help me."

As far as me not knowing anything: I was extremely insecure about my appearance from middle school to high school. Never went to a school dance, never kissed a girl until I was 18 and it was awful and not someone I was attracted to. Never went to prom. Tried committing suicide by driving my car straight into a telephone pole at 17. Now I’m 31 , and have a healthy sex life and have had my fair share of beautiful partners (it’s hard to say something like that humbly but I’m just trying to make a point). I wish I didn’t listen to the guys in high school that bullied me and called me ugly. Maybe I could have experienced so much.

TikTokCringe,f4grlet,t1_f4dtxds,1571583836.0,"Maybe he is doing it to make himself look better. Maybe he’s actually a good person in real life too. It’s possible both of those statements are true simultaneously too. You can decide to enjoy it or not enjoy it. If he didn’t record this we wouldn’t ever see it. So why would he not record himself doing good deeds? You could just as easily argue that someone not seeking recognition for their good deeds is doing that because they think they’re a better person for it, which could be an ego stroke.

All in all people can interpret things however they want. This guy could have filmed himself throwing bottles of water on people as he drove by. I’d rather watch this. It’s okay to enjoy things like this."
