I had \*created\* a life worth living. And the way I did it was by making very small, incremental changes in my behavior and my mindset, guided by weekly individual and group therapy in combination. The small changes built upon themselves and built upon themselves until not only was I consistently satisfied with my life, but also I was able to recognize when depression was creeping in and head it off at the pass.

This past year, my circumstances outstripped my ability to cope (a number of extraordinary circumstances all coming together at once, any one of which I could have managed, but which, all together, just completely did me in).

So, the answer to your question is, pretty much \*everything\* can get better. And while I am in a shit place right now, that does not render this assertion untrue. I \*remember\* what it was like to be happy, truly content, and some part of me trusts that it will be that way again. But I needed help to get there before.

What they DO is to help you get to a point where you can work effectively with a therapist to address the underlying issues and hopefully create a life worth living.

Also. It can take some time to find the right meds combination. That can be frustrating. If you do go on meds, communicate openly with your prescriber about side effects -- ANY side effects, even ones that don't seem all that intrusive. And communicate about how you feel they're working.

Where I live, we have at least some access to free or sliding scale mental health services, both in- and out-patient. Is that something you might have access to? Typically, you can call a local 2-1-1 and they would be able to connect you to these kinds of services in the community.

Also, if you can get your anxiety to qualify as a disability (the social security administration can do that for you, or if you have a therapist currently, they can likely at least start that process as well -- and it sounds like it would be easy for you to qualify), that would help with maintaining employment -- workplaces can make reasonable accommodations for people with all sorts of disabilities, including anxiety.
