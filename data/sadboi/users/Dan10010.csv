Also, at $125K per year, you really are considered upper class. I'm not surprised you do not see the urgency of the obvious healthcare crisis, it does not effect you whatsoever. You will be absolutely, perfectly fine whether or not medicare for all passes. Even if, hypothetically, you were to LOSE let's be as generous as $2000 per year (you won't, at least according to the calculator with the info you have given me, I am still seeing that you will net save money) how is that not a perfectly reasonable price to pay to help those who are being left behind by this current rapacious, mafia-like, for-profit healthcare system? How is that not a reasonable price to pay to improve the health of the entire country as a whole and clean up this mess of a system? How is that not a reasonable price to pay to modernize America and bring it up to par with the rest of the world?

And all that is assuming you WILL lose money, which as I said before, I do not see that in the calculator. If you could fill out the calculator for me with your info, and link it back to me, I am EXTREMELY curious to see the result you are getting. PLEASE humor me on this one.
