homefitness,fpk6ue0,t3_gdx8fc,1588689121.0,"The rings are a good bet because you can work with body strength, which can be good for muscles. As for the weights, since you can‚Äôt do high volume training, I would use the weights and do many repetitions in order to strain your muscles. A mix of many fast paced repetitions, your rings, and maybe some isolation exercises with slower movements to work on imbalances should be good. (I‚Äôm not an expert, just my opinion)"

I am currently on a rediet, increasing my calories by 50 every 4ish days. DO NOT INCREASE ALL AT ONCE. You will gain so much fat, realistically. This is why so many ppl fail at dieting. This is a gradual process, and make sure you‚Äôre weightlifting as well. I have an ED and this is so hard for me. Look up ‚Äúredieting‚Äù on YouTube. Some suggestions:

I'll try to resist the temptation so my body isn't used to eating there anymore. Now that I think about it, my life does revolve around food: when I eat and which food I eat. You never really think about it until someone says it. Thank you for the advice."
WeightLossAdvice,fiuvt3a,t1_fiu5bqt,1582749180.0,"What time do you eat? I feel like OMAD is so intense, like there's no way you can get in enough calories to fuel your body, especially if you work out and need protein after."

BPD,fhhhlxa,t3_f35wup,1581604398.0,"Omg yes. If I listen to a sad song, it triggers me to enter a depressive state. Sometimes I need to listen to sad songs to validate my emotions, though."
BPD,fhhh56o,t3_f34dnt,1581604090.0,"I feel this so much! The only way I combat it is occasionally writing poems/journals. My mom always tries to get me to open up to her, but she doesn't understand and I don't have the energy to explain. I'm seeing a therapist (first session is today) and I'm nervous because I feel like emotions aren't necessarily able to be translated into words. I don't even understand my own emotions, so how can I convey them?"
WeightLossAdvice,fhhgsls,t3_f2w9zq,1581603853.0,Can you give an example of a typical day of eating? Like yesterday for example?

WeightLossAdvice,fh7s6vo,t3_f1mnc6,1581343259.0,"Tbh I‚Äôve never heard the gay guys being fit thing. If you wanna lose weight, I find it more motivating to do it for yourself and not others. Doing it for other people creates a fad diet, and the goal is lifestyle change. You said that cardio is hard for you, is there a specific reason?"
WeightLossAdvice,fh7ru9t,t3_f1n57b,1581342980.0,"If you want to lose fat, focus on 80% cardio in your workouts. I recommend HIIT workouts. Look up Group HIIT on YouTube: they have a wide variety. There are plenty of videos, though, some more intense than others. I would start gradually because your body won‚Äôt be used to that intensity even though you weight lift. Weight lifting is good, but won‚Äôt really cause fat loss. Just toning. You can do both, but focus more on cardio because that‚Äôs where the fat burning happens."
WeightLossAdvice,fh7rkg6,t3_f1j7qx,1581342759.0,"I agree with water/green tea. Coconut water can help because it has electrolytes, but if you do this don‚Äôt drink too much because in a larger amount it can break the fast. In moderation it can help with energy. You might be feeling hungry because the food you ate before the fast isn‚Äôt sustaining you enough. Aim for protein and healthy fats like chicken and brown rice, maybe some nuts throughout the day. Also, don‚Äôt automatically go to a 20:4 day fast if you‚Äôve never fasted before. There‚Äôs a circadian rythym fast, then 16:8, etc. Start gradually."
WeightLossAdvice,fh7r9s6,t3_f1hwgf,1581342513.0,"I agree with the others. Something that has helped me is to remove the bad snacks from my eyesight. If I don‚Äôt see them, I‚Äôm less likely to mindlessly grab for them. Also, when I go grocery shopping, I buy healthier snacks like veggie chips and almond butter and leave them in the open if I can. If you don‚Äôt buy the snacks, you can‚Äôt eat them! Finally, meal prep. Planning which healthy snacks I can eat throughout the day has helped. I limit myself to about 2 healthy snacks per day. Just some examples of snacks: small yogurt cup mixed with granola, granola bites/bar, fruit cup with yogurt (I put in frozen fruit and top it with yogurt so that it freezes, but yogurt is optional), nuts, and almond butter with carrot sticks and apple slices. You can also cook stuff from those healthy food websites and that stuff can last you like 3 days. Good luck!"
SuicideWatch,fh6jbgc,t1_fh2z3ef,1581299919.0,"Same with me. I always believed I would never make it past 16. It was never an option.

WeightLossAdvice,fh6is5r,t1_fh6albo,1581299680.0,"Thank you. I'm always careful about nut calories, but I do tend to eat them as snacks because of the good fats. I usually dip carrots and apples in almond butter as a snack if I don't have actual nuts."
WeightLossAdvice,fh5fpqz,t1_fh3s3d7,1581288587.0,Why nuts? Just curious.
BPD,fh53g89,t3_f100id,1581284697.0,"I can't believe other people feel this way too! Ever since I was young, maybe like 5, I would always repeat ‚ÄùI just want to go home.‚Äù I thought it was because I hated being at daycare and would always wish to go home and I just kind of had that in my mind but reading these replies makes so much sense. I wanted comfort and safety, but I always felt isolated as a child."
SuicideBereavement,fh506p5,t3_f1bjze,1581283796.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry. Losing anyone is hard, but especially in this way is horrible. Just know that you're not alone in this. You treated her as best as you could in those moments, and sometimes even that is not enough to save someone from their own demons. None of this was your fault. Or hers. Some trauma is just too heavy to move past despite our best efforts."
SuicideWatch,fgo25k3,t1_fgnxfim,1580958026.0,"I see you‚Äôve given all of your options serious consideration. I‚Äôm sorry that this was the last result.

If this many strangers are affected by you, I wonder how your family will feel about it? I know you mentioned that you weren‚Äôt close with them, but you never know how much someone actually cares until the end. It‚Äôs sick, but true."

Do you often channel your emotions into your art? I was never a great artist, more of a writer, so I keep a journal. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to put words to feelings though, so art seems it could offer a decent outlet?"
orangetheory,fgm4tyh,t1_fgm2hwl,1580918011.0,"Yeah, I‚Äôm definitely transferring gyms if I continue with CF. I might take your idea, I‚Äôm just OCD about my form."
SuicideWatch,fgm0xf8,t3_ez85oq,1580915663.0,"Hi. I‚Äôve been thinking about your post for a few minutes now. I relate a lot to it...perhaps a bit too much and it‚Äôs scary to realize that. Life is painful and throws so much at you that it‚Äôs hard to breathe sometimes. I‚Äôve been trying to stay afloat, but it‚Äôs hard. What I‚Äôve learned, though, is that if life were easy there would be smiles on everyone and rainbows in the sky- we would be a world of robots with no grit and no lessons. Life would be more meaningless than it is with all of our struggles because we‚Äôd just walk through life with a smile. But then, how could we smile? How could we know what happiness even feels like if we never felt anything else? 

Do you ever wish you could go back in time to a place when you didn‚Äôt have to worry about money and depression and could just live day by day? I know I do. I‚Äôm not sure of your relationship with your family, but would it be possible to stay there for a few months? If they knew of your possibility of homelessness, I think they would understand. I know you don‚Äôt want to hear about all the possibilities of the future because they‚Äôre just that: possibilities. I wish I could tell you for certain that you‚Äôll find the dream job. But it certainly can happen because it‚Äôs a possibility. Do you have a certain job you‚Äôd like? Just envisioning it means that it‚Äôs more possible than before because you can see a goal, a purpose. You do have purpose. Everyone does. Sometimes I cringe when I think of it because I don‚Äôt always believe it, but we do. It‚Äôs cheesy but where we are at this very moment is right where we are supposed to be. Don‚Äôt give up on this. You‚Äôve gotten through 22 years and you‚Äôre tired, but that tells me that only tells me that you‚Äôre strong."

BPD,f5mljgs,t1_f5l30o2,1572291151.0,"That makes sense. I guess seeing her everyday was something that I looked forward to, and I tried to connect with her when we saw each other. Fusing our interactions, which were honestly quite limited, and my imagination made me obsessed."
BPD,f5jn8i1,t3_do2n9d,1572233439.0,"I'm sorry that you feel this way. I have undiagnosed BPD too and these past two weeks I relapsed pretty bad. I think when someone gets to a point of genuinely thinking about ending their pain, which I admit to doing, a therapist might truly be a good idea. I went for my chronic anxiety and depression a few years ago and we ended up doing some DBT, which is technically for people with BPD. It helped because in essence it is a survival guide for BPD- it teaches you coping mechanisms. I would look into it! Best of luck xx"

BPD,f43w75a,t1_f42t1qe,1571345816.0,"I can only imagine. But, with someone who has BPD, just know that your ex was probably struggling a lot with his emotions and how to express them to you. Something that comes easily to others, like taking a breath and managing anger, is a huge struggle. BPD is a little different for everyone, but it takes a toll on not only that individual, but their family, friends, and partners. How you feel is valid, but remember that it was no easier for your ex."
BPD,f43vdq5,t1_f3ze31e,1571345541.0,"It's comforting to know someone understands- it's validating.  I have a journal that I have written in since I was around 12ish, and my mental health was never great even back then, so it's hard to not despise my younger self, or even my current self for my flaws. But I also know most of how I act is subconscious , which is why I've been working on my mental health for soo long. And I also know that person in the past was a stepping stone...don't beat yourself up for who you were, you were only trying to figure yourself out. We're trying to navigate not only life's obstacles, but those in our mind, and we can only do our best every day to work on them and be able to function, because even that is an achievement!"
BPD,f3yl786,t3_dit9fx,1571255622.0,"So relatable! I constantly feel like a burden, and if someone doesn't laugh or respond to what I say immediately, I feel like I have to explain myself because they must be offended or annoyed by me. I'm starting to realize that it's probably in my mind, but it feels so real to me. I also have chronic social anxiety disorder and general anxiety disorder, so that plays a part too. I realize I have to work on this more than I thought because I have become distant from all my friends."
BPD,f3yjpry,t3_diqfor,1571255020.0,"Wow okay, you just put a piece of my life into a paragraph. This is so relatable, it's kinda scary. The only thing is that this jealousy turns into an intense form of anger and depression for me...and I know I should probably feel bad about it, but I can't because I'm just so angry about it all."
