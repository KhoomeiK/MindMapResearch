depression,ezs38qw,t3_cp1ajy,1568082210.0,"I feel this way everyday! It became more apparent as I got into my mid 20s and realized I was totally lost. I feel like I don’t have a connection with anyone and even with some of my friends who I’ve known for years, I now feel disconnected and awake are with. I feel that I never have anything to talk about. The other day I realized I’m a loner who never wanted to be one😭"
