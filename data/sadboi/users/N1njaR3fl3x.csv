Recognize the small victories in each day. Cleaned up this, went on a walk, ate healthier, pursued an interest, spent some time looking at part time jobs you might be able to manage just a few hours a week at.

Whether acknowledged or not, you can make their lives better by simply winning this battle you are currently engaged in. Any time you make someone laugh, grab the mail, make their bed, do the dishes, be there to listen when they need, etc. You are passively improving their lives.

Thats not to say what she did was right and it wont make the hurt of her remarks go away but it will at least help you avoid spiraling into a toxic cycle.

I would also say that if your current councilor is not working it may be a good idea to try for someone else. That doesn't mean they are bad at their job and they (shouldn't) take it personally. Different people have different needs.

I really don't know much about the circumstances that led you to where you are or the extent of your feelings but when i get to that point i find doing something totally silly at least helps stave off the waves.

You'll find that these are all relative value statements, in other words, ways in which we compare one thing to another.

The issue is, that in every aspect, there may be someone funnier, smarter, faster, stronger, etc. Than another human being. Now thats all well and good but at the end of the day those words are just ways of measuring people's worth in those aspects, but they are useless in determining the whole picture. 

You need not be the ""smartest,"" not getting into college does not make you worthless or unintelligent, it simply means that you dont work well in that environment, and that's absolutely fine.

My apologies if thats a rather jarring statement, and its of no offense to the actual humans that create it but fuck society as a concept.

Its a rather dangerous game we play doing moral math and putting the good of all people over the well-being of ourselves and those around us. 

In the words of Rousseau:

""It is reason that engenders self-love, and reflection that strengthens it; it is reason that makes man shrink into himself; it is reason that makes him keep aloof from everything that can trouble or afflict him: it is philosophy that destroys his connections with other men; it is in consequence of her dictates that he mutters to himself at the sight of another in distress, You may perish for aught I care, nothing can hurt me. Nothing less than those evils, which threaten the whole species, can disturb the calm sleep of the philosopher, and force him from his bed.""

In the grand scheme of things, id argue its most important to do the best for those around you, as thats where youll have the most impact regardless. Those people, as well as you, matter.

Also, please dont apologize for things like wasting others time. Your problems are valid and important, in other words perfectly worth the time of others. Until you start treating them as such you may never solve them.

High school is rough and i totally understand where you're coming from. It's tough to find your own way when you're funneled through this system that really couldn't care less about individuals. I wish I had solutions for you but id say your best bet is to inspect the motivations behind your actions and see where your real passions lie.

blackdesertonline,ev0y7n6,t1_ev0wl4n,1564148886.0,"Ty for the reply ^^

I feel like thats where im torn, they are both really solid its just that sorcs a bit better in group pvp. I think im going to do lahn anyways tho, i feel it will be more enjoyable for me in the long run.

Thanks again :)"
blackdesertonline,ev0v95a,t3_chz6l6,1564147273.0,"Brand new player to bdo and im enjoying it alot so far. At this point, however, im stuck trying to pick between two classes, those being the lahn and the sorc. I was wondering how you guys felt the two are in terms of gameplay style and if lahn is viable as a main for all content in the future.

(I recognize the two are rather difficult classes to start with and accept that there will be a massive learning curve and gear grind with both)

Tl;dr: how do lahn and sorc play in endgame content, which do you prefer, and is lahn viable as a main for all content?

Ty in advanced for replies and guidance ^^"

Im in a pretty tight spot too if im honest, i cant know exactly what your dealing with but we all end up at the end of this road somehow, i hope you're still around. i wont promise things will get better but sometimes all it takes is one thing to hold on to.

Do you have any hobbies you still enjoy?  I like reading when i have the motivation, Steinbeck and Blake are my favorites as of late."

SuicideWatch,equxnca,t1_eqsk993,1560337433.0,"They are not. Recognizing depression for what it is can be dangerous as you are acknowledging the power it can have in your life but its its something they simply couldn't understand. I've gotten the same thing from concerned friends. They aren't terrible people they simply cannot relate. Most people never even consider-seriously- the prospect of suicide. Your feelings are real, and they are not your fault. They can also be defeated, not with guilt or righteous anger but a careful, disciplined, and professionaly guided introspection. 

If you want to make up for this to your roommates, please-seek help. You can beat this, and in time this will all be a lesson you can impart on those you care for and those whom care for you."
