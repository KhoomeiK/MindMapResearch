AskReddit,fpvymli,t3_gfvz50,1588954171.0,"I tried asking this in r/antinatalism but the post was removed because my post history shows ‚Äúbad faith‚Äù. Yes, I have a biological child whom I love with all of my heart, but please hear me out.

I am the granddaughter of an orphan and have seen first-hand the horrors of some foster homes and how that trauma follows through generations (ie. the same brutality used on my grandpa was then used on my father who then used it on us bc of the learned behavior). I believe that in the right home, we can see an end to these behaviors, and ultimately an end to most evils. This is why I have always wanted to adopt and am excited to start foster care adoption classes this summer with my husband. 

I participate in r/suicidewatch a great deal (I‚Äôve lived through what many of them are struggling with today and it helps to talk to someone who truly understands those feelings and thoughts). Because of this, Reddit suggested I would be interested in r/antinatalism. I didn‚Äôt know what it was when I visited, but after reading a few dozen posts, I began to see this philosophy as something that could be really good for this world. 

So I ask, what are the chances that an antinatalist would adopt or foster children once they feel they are mentally and financially sound in doing so?

Edited: a word."

antinatalism,fps8wo2,t1_fprrvlj,1588869439.0,"I think the issue with donating to charities is that you have very little control over how your money is spent within the organization and even less visibility to their roadmap unless you comb through their financials. That being said, we are in a good place and we do donate quite often but only to organizations we‚Äôve thoroughly researched. I once thought of starting my own orphanage but there‚Äôs plenty of research against such operations and for fostering/adopting instead. 

I believe we can eradicate evil through education and a large part of that education can come from the home. I also look at how many children are available for adoption in my state and just wonder what it will take to normalize foster-care adoptions. I wonder if those who are passionate about antinatalism could also be equally as passionate about providing a loving nurturing home to an already existing child who so desperately needs it.

But you‚Äôre right, you not only need to be financially sound, you have to be in the right mindset for that kind of undertaking. Foster care, adoption, and even respite services are not for the faint of heart. 

Thanks for sharing."

Not sure on that one, I was able to take my CHL class with no issues but never bought a gun.

SuicideWatch,fnsobkz,t3_g3pf9o,1587225652.0,"Honestly, getting a better/higher education. 

My mom sent me to a hospital and I always felt like she just gave up on me rather than try to really understand me. At the time I wasn‚Äôt in school and I was just waiting tables feeling like I had no future. 

It wasn‚Äôt until I found something that truly challenged me and I was able to shift my focus/passion towards that when I finally overcame the majority of my suicidal thoughts. Did they go away forever? No, I‚Äôve struggled with them my entire life, but I understand the triggers and what is happening to me chemically when I feel that way. I am also extremely grateful for how my life has turned out, so my gratitude often exceeds my depression.

I suffered from manic depression and borderline bipolar disorder. I will say the hospitals helped a bit in the sense that I was able to look around and realize this is not what I wanted my life to become. I was admitted twice, the first time against my will into the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù side. The second time I was willingly admitted by my social worker because I was so far gone I couldn‚Äôt speak. They sent me to PICU that time. 

I found Outliers by Malcom Gladwell to be extremely helpful. I was comparing myself to others and their seemingly perfect lives instead of finding my own definition of success. Outliers helped me to find pride in who I was/am and define what success meant to me. It was a hell of a journey, but I‚Äôm so glad I lived through it because here I am 15 years later talking about starting projects for Fortune 500 companies that can transform the way we do things in this world. I may even run for Vice President one day. Who would have thought that the granddaughter of an orphan, a child who was beaten/spit on/bullied to the point of eating disorders, someone who grew up on the ‚Äúwrong side of the tracks‚Äù, been in and out of jail, and took 10 years to graduate college would have the opportunities I have today? 

If you can power through the hard times and forge ahead, life is certainly worth living. I agree with you, community/support groups are incredibly helpful. I never joined one for mental health because I never knew of any when I was struggling, but I‚Äôve joined them for other areas of my life and they are my favorite way to get help in times of struggle. 

TLDR: Getting a higher education and Outliers by Malcom Gladwell helped the most, but going to hospitals also helped. Community/support groups are great."

While they may *appear* to have had it easier, they are likely facing their own battles that you have not yet seen or heard about. 

I was asked once, what‚Äôs the point in striving to live? I think it‚Äôs children. To see tiny inklings of my best self live on through these kids fills me with a kind of joy I never knew possible. 

When I was younger, it was so easy to just wish it all away. To constantly think about ways I‚Äôd end my life. I was hospitalized twice because of it, one of those times sending me to PICU. Ever been to PICU? It‚Äôs pretty fucked up. In time I learned to gain control of my emotions, to understand what triggered me, and the wisdom I needed to see future possibilities when I felt all was lost. 

Living through this gives me a chance to share how I did it, and give those struggling advice so that their road may be easier than mine. I call them lessons learned and I am so thankful to have lived through them.
