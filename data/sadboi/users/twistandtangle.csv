AmItheAsshole,fqxidlt,t3_glcrx9,1589732760.0,"NTA at all! As the daughter of a young, single mother, this infuriates me. While you could have helped out your sister in some ways IF YOU WANTED (babysitting your niece occasionally, lending a single room for a week while she found a place, helped set up college things for her, etc.) taking care of her entire situation should not even be close to your responsibility. And it certainly should not he considered your responsibility by your family without your input. 

Being a single Mom is hard and I watched my mom struggle for years to give both of us the best life she could. Yes, she struggled probably even more than I saw, but she was always gracious to people who helped her, she always paid money and kindness back, and most importantly she NEVER assumed someone would take pity on her and give her something for free.

Your sister needs to grow up and take responsibility for herself or else her kid will only continue this cycle of entitled behaviour. I hope for your sake your family sees how ridiculous it is because this shouldn't be on your shoulders...particularly after they lied to you, attempting to make you pay everything off! You have nothing to explain to them and while I don't generally condone ignoring people, your family is being ridiculous and you all need some space for the realization of how unbelievably selfish they're being. I'm sure if you tell your friends about the ""75 000 lie"" they'd understand the ridiculousness better too.

All that being said: sorry you have to deal with this.

They may be able to put you in touch with someone who CAN listen to your feelings and help validate them for you, if they don't try to themselves...But most of all, I would encourage you to give yourself new opportunities.

I was in your shoes in high school. I felt like/realized my friends didn't take me seriously and often took my compassion for granted. The best thing I did was decide that I could still be friends with them, but I needed a different support system too, so I started joining extra curriculars. Finding new friends does not automatically mean you aren't friends with the old ones, but if they draw that line then they probably aren't good friends to begin with.

I don't know who you are as a person, but I found joining arts programs (visual art, theatre, photography, yearbook) tends to house a lot of the individuals who are in touch with their emotions, much like you are. Sports had people like that too, don't get me wrong, but it was a little too much about the competition for my liking rather than exploring yourself. I encourage you to try something new, because it's likely you'll meet new friends and they will hopefully be more supportive.

I really hope things get better for you and remember that communities like this are here to help you, even if we can't be there in person.

Good luck <3"

Two of my uncles got married within a month of one another. One of them was in a horrible work accident that screwed up his face for when he was the groomsman for Uncle 2 AND he was still recovering for his own wedding. No one in my family blinked once and considered he should be REMOVED from the wedding parties. The only question was if he was healthy enough to even make it to them. 

Pictures are important for a wedding day, I agree. But it seems your hope for perfection doesn't just translate to how you and your partner look, but also your sister. That's not healthy. On the other hand, if you're truly going to resent her for ""being all bandaged"" in your wedding pictures with her sore and broken body after she is going to try like hell to cover it up so it doesn't take attention from you...well, maybe you should spare her from such cruelty."
AmItheAsshole,f3sj51y,t3_dhrtpz,1571103683.0,"Listen, if you wanted to make this work, you could. People do it every day. The child you're about to give birth to could easily share YOUR room as you look for new accommodations, leaving the foster child a room of their own in the meantime. Someone could ask for a raise or get a second job. There are social assistance programs while you work out this new situation. I know single parents who have multiple jobs and jobs while in full time classes to keep afloat. This is not only all possible but this is more common than not, having an unexpected child thrown into the mix. The real problem here is that while you ""did the hard math"" you didn't seem to ask the harder questions, such as, ""WHY aren't we looking into other ways to make this work?"" Because while you could have tried, it doesn't seem like you've really looked into ways to make this work for your foster child, too. So yes, YTA. 

Either way, there is no winning now. That foster child knows that your choice of a family no longer includes them if it's inconvenient to you. That's not something he will ever forget and I doubt he'll ever get over it, too. Make sure you help him find a family who is in the position where they will be able to prioritize HIM first, because every kid deserves the love you're now afraid you can't provide."
legaladvicecanada,exjnk6c,t1_exjh3x0,1566355049.0,"Alright, this is a long response and kind of sappy, but not a word of it is a lie. 

>This has ruined sex for me not that’s what I should be worried about Rn. 

Thinking about the long term impact this woman has had on you is important and there is nothing wrong with acknowledging that sex has new meaning. Sex is important (despite the stigma that its simply for gratification) and it's one of the leading causes for most breakups, divorces, and insecurities. Most people just don't realize how important it is until the act of it has become something negative. What you are feeling is valid. Sad, but absolutely valid. 

>She and I have broken up. But I still worry about her and I shouldn’t I have no idea what the fuck is wrong with me

Nothing is wrong with you. As previously stated, your feelings are valid and before this fuckery, you were in love with her. Love doesn't usually fade away and real love does not immediately fade away when things get rough. It will take time to move past this woman...and that's okay. I cannot stress it enough.

What you need to worry about right now is your safety. You've already begun by breaking ties with her...but emotions don't hold the same boundaries. It will take time. And with time and help for your mental health, that weight in your chest will not feel as heavy and all consuming. I know no one likes to hear that it takes time... But it does. You'll have good days and bad days, but soon you'll notice the good days will start outnumbering the bad. And then after a while of that, you'll wake up one day and say, ""how long has it been since I even thought that way?"" And that day will be incredible. I promise.

Even your family would not want you dead. And if your family are assholes about this, it's likely because they can't understand that it's hurting you as much as it is. Please consider seeking help.  Not just for the legalities that might come of this, not just for getting over the trauma you have just faced, not just for the depression you've been fighting for so many years, not just because cops are at a higher risk for PTSD (particularly with previous mental health issues), if not for all that then just so you can figure out how to talk to others about this. It's a scary first step, baring your soul to someone, but it's an immediate relief.

You are an incredible man who has done incredible things. You became a cop to help people, you tried desperately to help the woman you love despite the things she's done to you, you constantly worry for your family and try to make them proud. Do not sell yourself short. People like you are so wonderful and so important...please don't give into those demons in your head. Please don't give up being the kind of person this world needs."
legaladvicecanada,exjm1ab,t1_exjhbgb,1566353888.0,"So I'm responding all over the place here, but you just said something very important here.

Do not trust this woman. I know I'm not the first saying it, but this sounds like a trick. No urine test is more accurate than a blood test when it comes to pregnancy. That she had a negative pregnancy test makes me wonder if she faked the at home test (actually kind of easy if it'd what you're aiming to do). 

Unless you watched her pee on that stick and watched the result pop up, she could have gotten that test from anywhere. The blood test at the doctors is far more accurate -- consider that urine tests catch pregnancy around three weeks in, blood tests catch pregnancy around or just after the one week mark.

There is something wrong with this woman's story and she's trying to put this all on your shoulders. Get a restraining order immediately and if this pregnancy turns out to be true and she tries to make you take part in her and this child's life, file for a paternity test as soon as you can."
legaladvicecanada,exivk7m,t1_exipdod,1566336453.0,"Sorry, but for the sake of the OPs awareness I need to correct you. Precum itself doesn't have sperm, but sperm CAN leak into precum, particularly if he is close to climax. And we have to remember it only takes a single sperm to get pregnant. Sperm also last up to five days inside a woman's body, leaving time for ovulation before/during/after which is actually one of the main causes of so many accidental pregnancies. 

I think his best bet is to test paternity thanks to other circumstances. But the science here sadly is sound. It's possible she got pregnant, climax or no, it's just not as likely."
legaladvicecanada,exiv025,t1_exilwcz,1566336132.0,"Yes! That's exactly what I was going to say.

I'm so sorry this happened to you, OP. Her behaviour is deplorable and she should be put in jail. It sounds like her intent was to get pregnant, but if you don't remember climaxing, it may not have been you who SUCCEEDED in getting her pregnant. For her to know at 3.5 weeks of being pregnant is suspicious. It's not impossible of course, but it may be a sign that she was hoping for this to happen and was testing (and, unfortunately, taking advantage of you) until she got a positive result. 

First things first, break up with her. The damage has been done and all her threats are pretty much nil and void now that she has this leverage. She'll probably tell people you're an asshole, but at least if this goes to court you have it documented that you do not accept these circumstances. 

Next (and most important) is that you do not assume paternity. Get a test done to prove if you are the father (this will need to wait until she is farther along), this can be court ordered if she refuses to do it on her own but maintains you need to support her and the child. If she has a turbulent pregnancy you may need to wait until the baby is born for testing. Until this is done, there isn't a ton more advice to give. 

As for your family not supporting you, I am sorry. If you are already depressed, I worry for your safety because there's a good chance things will get worse. This is a horrible situation all around...but you're going to want some people in your corner and I urge you to reach out. Whether it be friends, family, neighbours, psychologists, please make sure you have a good support system because no matter what happens next, you don't want to be alone.

Good luck."

I started off only leaving him alone for a few minutes at a time. First just walking around the block, then going to the store, then going to coffee with a friend, then work, etc. Obviously this isn't an option for everyone, but expanding increments seemed to really help. 

As for the routine itself, I take him for a walk so he can get tired. Then when we get home I get ready, then I put on background noise for him (our walls are thin and he doesn't like hearing my annoying neighbour), finally I give him his favourite Kong bone filled with peanut butter and leave, not making a big deal as I go *very important* and letting him be distracted by the treat. 

It did not work immediately. It took him a long time to anticipate these patterns, but the routine did help within a few weeks because I did it multiple times a day. After a while he got used to this pattern and knew that I'd come back because I always came back. Now I have a dog who starts to wag his tail when he notices these cues because he knows he gets peanut butter :)

On that note, condoms have the potential to be much more effective than the BC pill thanks to the general user error with it (taking it consistently, whether it's estrogen or progesterone can dictate whether or not you ovulate, etc). This isn't even to mention the fact you're reacting to the hormones so any form of hormomal BC still isn't an option. If YOU want to consider a hormoneless IUD, such as the copper IUD, that's a conversation you can have with him (without extra input from his goddamn family) and then it's YOUR decision to make if it goes into your body.

Dogtraining,eva40hq,t1_ev9re4f,1564338281.0,"It's funny you say that the OP is being ""too judgy"" when you are also being ""too judgy"" towards them. Clearly the OP doesn't want to discuss the various details because his friends mental state doesn't directly involve the question. He doesn't need to go into painstaking detail with strangers online. We are here to give advice on what they deem is a problem, not tell them the problem doesn't exist."
AskVet,ev9kyqd,t3_civz4r,1564324635.0,"Hi there. I know it can be stressful seeing things in your dog's poop, so it's always better to seek advice. It's a little hard to tell from the photo (only having one angle) but it appears that your dog could have eaten something you might not have been expecting. I see that it's from a lab cross...I also found out the hard way that labs are notoriously bad for eating things when bored or anxious as well as developing cases of pica (the actual illness of chronically eating non-food related items).

I would wait to see what the next poop is like and if it still has the same material in it...if it does, I'd keep the poop and examine it. If you can, as gross as this may sound, I'd even sift through the poop you photographed to try and see if you can identify what it is your dog may have eaten. The alternative is to check your home and see if any remains are left behind of something he may have gotten into. If this persists or your dog begins showing signs of discomfort, take him to the vet immediately so they can xray and see what's going on in there. But for one poop, unless your dog is showing signs of blockage, I wouldn't panic. Signs of blockage include lethargy, discomfort, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, lack of appetite, or changes in behaviour.

Good luck and please keep us updated!"
Dogtraining,ev9hs4s,t3_cit59x,1564322101.0,"Maybe I'm forgetting you mentioning it, but have you considered talking to your friend about their mental health? I know it's a tough conversation to have, but if someone told me that my mental health was also affecting my dogs', I'd take much more immediate action than if I was only internalizing it for myself. Sometimes mental illness puts blinders on you, making it so you can only see what's in front of you and not what's happening at the sides. And if your friend assumes his neighbour (though now hostile) may help the dog, they might not realize they are no longer chipping in. As difficult as I know it might be, a conversation is probably the first step to take. If at that point nothing happens, more drastic measures might be needed. 

Personally, I'd first try the conversation about his actions and then begin mentioning available dog services and daycares. Then if it continues, I'd say that the dog needs a new home (even if only until your friend can catch his footing). But be careful, because pitbulls have bad reps that can make people nervous about dealing with them. If, let's say, animal control comes to separate the dog from the owner and the dog gets scared and bites? It could end badly. I'd say it should be a last resort.

I really hope you can get through to your friend and the dog finds a safe and stable home. Good luck and please update us if you can!"
londonontario,euedwu0,t3_cfx6ln,1563741939.0,"Honestly, it depends on the severity of the hernia. A family member of mine is also waiting to get hernia damage repaired and it took her a long time to get in to see the specialist at all, despite being a pretty severe case. After your initial consultation with the surgeon, they'll schedule it either when they have time (usually a couple months after that visit) or they'll try to sneak you in as quickly as manageable. The problem is that you then have zero control over when that surgery date will be and they may call on you suddenly with a cancellation space. 

After going through this with my family, I hate to admit it but these other redditors are right...if it's not a severe hernia, 3+ months is a very standard wait. We just don't have enough specialists here in London. On the other hand, if you are willing to travel to Toronto for consults/surgery/check ups, you could get a referral and get in there faster. Good luck!"
dogs,ettyfrg,t3_cdgv4n,1563199624.0,Good luck to you and Thor! I have heard stories about it but haven't encountered anyone who has sadly had to experience it. I hope everything turns out well...Im off to find a higher shelf (even if I need a stepping stool to do it) for my own sugar free candies.
AnimalAdvice,etgevd6,t3_cbbcri,1562789465.0,"I'm not sure where you live so rules can be different where I am vs. Where you are. Do you happen to know who your pets were registered by? If your mother was the one to register your pets, you can call the authorities and explain that they are being held in your father's home without your permission and that he refuses to return them to you. If the dogs aren't under your mother's name it could be more difficult, but if you truly fear for their safety you can still report it  by saying that your father is not sole owner of the animals and that you would like them removed from his household for safety. I hope everything works out!"
AnimalAdvice,et3rbvm,t1_et3r0ed,1562437906.0,"Oh, I should also mention that hazelnuts can cause the same reaction as peanuts if he has a generalized nut allergy, instead of a generalized peanut allergy... And it's not always something a vet can immediately know. So for that alone, I would stop with the Nutella until you're able to determine what his body doesn't like. Good luck to you and your pup."
AnimalAdvice,et3r0ed,t3_c9nxhz,1562437762.0,"No, coffee is on the same level as chocolate. Both of them contain methylxanthines. If they get too much of that chemical for their personal size/weight/metabolism/etc. it can cause things like heavy panting, intense thirst, and frequent urination. When symptoms worsen it can then lead to things like hyperactivity, abnormal heartbeat, tremors, vomiting, seizures, and can lead to death. There are many foods safe for humans that aren't safe for dogs based on chemical properties, it might be worth looking up to see what else you may have been feeding him that could be causing this reaction. For a start, here's a list of the most common foods that dogs have reactions to without being allergic:

AnimalAdvice,et1gdgl,t3_c9nxhz,1562396945.0,"I would stop this ASAP. Nutella is a chocolate and hazelnut spread, specifically made out of cocoa powder. Cocoa powder isn't just the regular chocolate we eat in candy bars, but a purer form (and I could be mistaken but I believe I remember that it's the second most dangerous form of chocolate to dogs behind bakers chocolate). On top of that, Nutella has a ton of sugar that can be much more concerning than whether or not it's gluten free. I can't guarantee that it's what is causing your dogs lethargy, but the more you feed him, the higher the risk of him having a reaction."
Anxiety,et0y5mn,t1_eszsrze,1562388881.0,"Thank you. I wasn't sure whether it was worth posting, but I'm glad that it resonated with a few people :)"
Anxiety,eszs6mc,t3_c9hktw,1562367000.0,"Ah, I can actually maybe help here! I haven't read all the replies (I got too excited) and I know I'm probably not as worldly or knowledgeable as some others, but over the years I've learned a few short cuts to help with my anxiety over situations like this and I JUST told my little sister (who also has anxiety) about this little trick too.

If you want to save face with the company, I suggest writing a letter. Take your time writing it, only say positive things. Tell them how much you appreciated the opportunity, throw in some charm and specifics about things you learned and enjoyed, and say that you're sorry but school is your priority and you can't afford to fall behind any more.

Put that letter in an envelope and take your time to steel your nerves as much as you can. When you feel ready, go in to your manager and simply say, ""I'm so sorry, but I need to hand you my notice.""

They may ask a follow up question or two, like if you'll work your two weeks (depending on your contract) but everything else they can find in the letter and you can tell them that. Then you don't have to sit there and have a long conversation about what was wrong when you're all tongue-tied and anxious. You leave looking considerate, professional, and without much confrontation. 

Good luck in school and this scary stepping stone. I hope you feel confident enough to be able to quit before you're too miserable and that you find something better suited to you :)"
Anxiety,eszql3y,t3_bzbml5,1562366266.0,"My life in a post. It's actually so nice to see that other people experience this too. I truly wish you didn't have to, but it's really nice not to feel alone."

uwo,eric0je,t3_c26zdg,1560894047.0,"I just did this hunt after living in the Cherryhill area for 10 years and it's a bit more on the expensive side. I'd hope that's it's a nicer place and furnished (as well as inclusive of internet and has lots of parking) for that price. Otherwise, I have seen places in areas very close to Cherryhill or Richmond that area that rent for 450+ a room. Maybe take a look at other places just in case?"
AnimalAdvice,eqp24sj,t3_byvzre,1560195077.0,"It could be a lot of things, quite honestly. Is the printer new, has it been newly relocated to a different place in your home, or have you been using it often?

They used to believe that cats would lay with the sick because they could predict that someone was going to die or sense they were ill. Science debunked this, for the most part. While they might be able to sense something is wrong or smell something off, they tend to do this because cats like the increase in a person's body temperature when they're ill. They find it comforting. They do this with other things too (laptops, fridges, anything that runs and emits heat). If your printer is plugged in and giving off more heat than before, she might simply be comforted by it.

I hope that's the case and it isn't anything serious! Good luck."
migraine,epcsmvn,t3_bu6j95,1559157981.0,"First and foremost, I'm so sorry this happened to you. I also grew up with migraine and it's not looking like anything will make my new intractable migraine go away (full diagnosis: Chronic daily intractable migraine with aura, hemiplegia, and seizure...approaching year three of daily, chronic pain and aura). 

If you have both hands going numb, that's generally not considered hemiplegia. Hemiplegic symptoms tend to be situated on one single side of your body (right hand only, right and left leg only, for example) and is generally a form of paralysis You might have similar symptoms, but they aren't ""hemiplegic migraines"" without that paralysis (this is important to know and tell your doctor because some triptans and birth control cause people with true hemiplegic migraine an increased risk of stroke!)

Have you ever gotten or considered Occipital Nerve Blocks? I get both those and Botox done. Botox works a little better (for me, at least) and the Nerve Blocks are more uncomfortable to be administered, but they do make a difference and they tend to be more easily covered by health insurance (at least where I'm from).

I hope you have luck with managing your pain and symptoms. Good luck with everything!"
