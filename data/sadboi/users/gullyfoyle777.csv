He loves playing online games, raiding, playing PlanetSide 2 etc. He is very good at practically everything he plays. Whenever he is playing with his friends or even just some people he hardly knows, he seems like he's having such a good time. They're raggin' on each other and shit. I sit there at my PC listening to him have this great time without me. It makes me so irrationally jealous. I hate it so much. He doesn't sound like that when he plays with me, or if he plays with me with mutual friends, just when I'm not there. I know it's wrong to feel this way. Except I rephrase it now. I want to feel differently. I've started reminding myself that he's not cheating on me. He's playing some fucking games, he's hanging out with friends. He's not leaving me.  I am not excluded because I didn't even ask to be included. I remind myself that he is an individual. I am an individual. So now when he's got gaming with his friends or whatever, I plan something for myself. I play a game I need to not have distractions with, or I'll watch a movie or series that he has no interest in, or schedule some game time with a friend. I'm trying to turn that time into ME time. If drinking this cup of coffee on my comfy couching counts as self soothing,  then I am pretty okay with that. I'm also trying to let myself see it from a different perspective, a selfless one even, where I am happy for him. I am happy he has a good time. I love him and I want him to be happy. Things other than him make me happy so why would I deny him that?  As you can see I try very hard to logic it out. Sometimes I'm successful. Sometimes I'm not and I have to just leave the room or take a nap. I'm just going to keep trying until I get better dulling the reaction. Maybe one day it won't bother me at all, I hope.

My cousin introduced us and we hit it off as friends. We were friends for 3 years. I left the abusive guy and Mr. Boomchicken asked me out. I told him I have rules. (Things like I have a kid so you're either in this for the long haul or you're out. I'm not parading a bunch of potential ""daddies"" in front of my kid. And things like no matter what the kid is more important than you or me. Etc etc) I laid them out. He agreed. He visited me one month from then. He moves to the same city a month after that. My kid and I moved in with him 2 months after that. He asked me to marry him 2 months from that! I said yes. My husband and I definitely have had our issues. He has anxiety and has been diagnosed with ADHD since childhood. He also had a severe eating disorder tied to his anxiety. I helped him with that. A lot of his ADHD thing are just the absolute perfect way to trigger me. But he really helped me unpack a lot of shit from my childhood and put up with some flat out abuse from me. I'm not even going to sugar coat it. He was patient and understanding 99% of the time, even when  I didn't deserve it. He said he saw me underneath all the self hatred, pain and everything else, even when I was splitting hard. We've survived because we strive to be honest as hell, even if it hurts. That's been our real big thing. Integrity is honor and my honor is my life (yep I'm a dork lol) I finally went to therapy and got a lot of good help. I am fortunate to have such an amazing person by my side. Now that I have gotten much better (not 100% but working on it), I've had more energy to help him. We have grown up into adults together, despite us both being adults when we met lol. I am such a better person because of him. He made me face truths I didn't want to face. I stopped running away from the things I didn't like about myself. It was really hard and there were many times I didn't think we were going to make it and not because he wanted to leave, but because I kept wanting to run.

I'm honestly doing better with not needing to use those methods to cope, but this quarentine has done a number on my mental health and self regulation. I don't think it's okay to manipulate people into giving you what you want. I think it's up to us to state plainly what we need and if we don't then we can't expect other people to fulfill that need.

I feel like the more I try to stuff that inner child into a hole, the more I become it. I don't know if that makes sense to anyone but me and my counselor lol. So I validate the kid inside of me. I listen, acknowledge, but I don't have to do what it says. I am my wise mind and I can make the adult decision for both of us. I don't have to do what my kid brain says. Just like when my daughter has a meltdown because she didn't get what she demanded.  I don't give in to her demands. I validate, I listen and I quell fears. (It's taken me awhile to get here btw with lots of failure along the way) I also think a lot of us really need to build some self confidence because the lack of it really infantilises us and make us require validation from outside ourselves when the validation needs to come from within. I'm still working on all these things currently, plus more, but I do feel like I'm growing up so to speak. I don't know if I'll ever feel like a true adult, but I do feel better than I used to. I feel more independent. So my answer is it does get better with lots of help, support, therapy etc. Don't give up hope and keeping trying. Hopefully I made sense in some way ‚ù§"

It makes me panic which makes me play shittier, not better. Now they take special care to stay 100% calm and avoid ""telling"" me what to do in a match and ""asks"" me super nicely to do things. I hate it! Not only am I ""the girl"" but now I have this bullshit too. I just asked them not to tell and scream at me. Now they treat me like I'm made of glass."
patientgamers,fohbpyi,t1_foh8clt,1587763301.0,"If you like Dwarf Fortress and you are okay with building a colony and seeing it go down in flames, literally and figuratively. It's a colony sim game but it's more like the story of the colony. Each colonist has traits that make up a personality. There are relations with other factions and quests. There are a lot of details and a hell of a lot of excellent mods. It has pretty good tool tips and detailed information about stuff in game. Getting a colony to survive more than two years can be a challenge. If you're okay with a bunch of failure before a success, then I'd say it's accessible. If you expect to do well immediately, then maybe not. I hope that helps."

TwoXChromosomes,fod5fiw,t3_g6owl8,1587680181.0,"I play World of Tanks on the NA server. I have been playing on and off for 6 years or so. When I first started playing (teams could talk to each other back then) I used to get so much shit for my name which has ""lady"" in it. I'd get accused of being some pedo dude, some f**, some degenerate etc etc. I would get players who decided I was the hottest thing, without every seeing me, and keep messaging me and trying to ""get closer"". I would get weird treatment fr clan leaders, some of whom would buy all the women premium on Valentine's day etc. And yeah that does make me mad about the vday thing because it's not fair to the men. I've had to block people for continuing to tell me to ""get back in the kitchen"". I'd always reply with ""what if my computer is in the kitchen? Maybe I'm just that goddamn fabulous to be cooking and gaming."" Sometimes the guy would laugh and tell me that was a good one and tell me to have a good day. Sometimes I'd have to block them and they would keep making accounts so they could harass me. For a few I actually had to go through support and file a ticket. I had one guy accuse me of ""using your gender to pad your stats"". I shit you not. My friends and I still laugh about that one. Yeah, being a womanly openly in games can be tough, but I think it's necessary if we expect change. We have to push for it. I understand some just can't deal with it and hide, but a lot of us need to make sure they know we are there and they have to deal with it. 

Oh, one time I told a guy in WoW to get back on the kitchen as a joke. He reported me and I got banned for 24 hours. Wtf. That was many years ago though."
gadgets,fo8zkui,t3_g6573p,1587607210.0,"Android would have to suck for a really long period of time in order for me to even consider dealing with iPhone and all its crap that goes with it (iTunes, apple store), including it's ""user friendly"" design that drives me up a wall. I had an iPhone 4s years ago. It had good sound but I was very happy with Androids layout when I switched. I guess we'll just have to see. It's not that important to me anyways. I don't game on my phone really."
CBT,fo6z4on,t3_g62nig,1587569390.0,"I definitely think cbt would help this because I have the same issue and I'm in CBT. My counselor and me just talked about this in our last session. I'm just gonna tell you a little about what he said, which made a lot of sense to me. He said one of the reasons people have a hard time accepting compliments or that they've done something well or something to be proud of is because it makes us feel unsafe. We are hyper vigilant about looking out for the bad, for the failure. We have our tools ready to either run, hide or fight. When we get good feedback, we relax, we let our guard down, hence the unsafe feeling. We need to recognize that being proud of something we did or accepting a compliment does not put us in danger. There is no danger, we just ""think"" there is. In fact, being hyper vigilant has probably never actually helped you/me avoid failure and may have actually pushed you towards it rather than away. Does that make any sense? I hope so. Sorry if it doesn't, I'm not always the best at explaining things, but I gave it my best shot. You should be able to do counseling via webcam or over the phone. üòä Good luck and have a good day!"
aldi,fo6p849,t3_g60k7c,1587564018.0,"I really like more ""masculine"" smells. I use men's body wash, use men's deodorant and wouldn't have an issue with my laundry smelling along the same lines. Of course everyone is different and it may not be a pleasing smell to you. I get it. üôÇ On the other hand, thank you for letting me know that this smells awesome! I'll probably pick some up this week and try it out üòä"
ConanExiles,fo5ru50,t1_fo5r0rx,1587533720.0,"I completely agree about every shot being art. I love that there is so little dialog and it's done well enough that it's not needed or missed. I love when a movie shows me things rather than just telling me. I also agree about Grace Jones. I didn't find Conan drunk to be as fun as when Conan's face fell in the porridge lol  but still decent.   üòÅI think describing the second movie as D&D like is pretty accurate. It was a shame because a few of the things in the second movie were actually in Howard's Conan short stories. They just didn't seem to be accurately represented, as if it was half hearted.

 I've got to ask the inevitable question, have you ever read Robert E. Howard? I had to ask."
ConanExiles,fo5mvqm,t1_fo4uknz,1587529680.0,"Hahaha I'm just a big dork. He's used to it because in WoW I had a dual wielding warrior. I would carry an axe with me (I normally had two swords at the time equipped). Whenever we'd get to a ledge or something we had to jump off, I would make him wait while I equiped my axe. I would then stand on the edge with sword in one hand and axe in the other, remembering  the coolest part from Conan the Destroyer, which I would describe every single time (that poor guy lol). The part at the end of the movie where Conan stands on the ledge up top and has a sword and an axe. That moment before he jumps down is so fucking Frank Frazetta-ish Conan and I just love it. I really didn't like the second movie that much, but a few scenes were good. The first movie is superior in every way."
CBT,fo51r8u,t3_g5nw4n,1587515654.0,My sessions have always been two weeks apart except for the first 3.

BPD,fo3ubqr,t3_g5f6ff,1587493079.0,"I am graceful on the outside about the criticism but on the inside I am screaming at myself and wanting to self harm. My brain will use that tiny bit of criticism to fuel months of depression and feelings of worthlessness. I'm trying to work on that because it is me literally making my life worse when I don't need to. I recognize it's my cognitive distortions that are causing most of the pain. Just like I can't accept a compliment either. With that it's because if I relax and let the compliment be, I'm not being hyper vigilant looking for the bad. I'm convinced the bad is going to sneak up on me and rock me when I'm not looking or I'll be made to look like a fool. Except that's another distortion. I don't think I've ever actually prevented anything bad happening to me or bad feelings by being hyper vigilant about it. I think it's only caused me pain and anxiety. So I think the criticism is almost like external validation for all those negative nasty thoughts. Because I have a hard time accepting the good, the bad is blown out of proportion. It also means I am only allowing the bad in my world to flourish and nothing else. Obviously the key is finding a balance which is what everyone is struggling to do, including me. Good luck everyone and have a nice day. ‚ù§"
mildlyinfuriating,fo3t0sk,t1_fo344m4,1587492461.0,"No problem! I forgot something. When you dye with semi permanent you can't let it dry out or it will stop working. Just use a shower cap or a plastic bag (like I do lol). Now if you want to really get the dye to stick you can use your hair dryer on warm, not hot (don't melt the plastic on your head), and warm up your hair/dye jumble through the bag. The heat helps it stick. If it's a hot summer day then I wouldn't worry too much about using the hair dryer. Lastly, if you are able to, I recommend washing your hair in the kitchen sink for the first few washes. Most sinks are stainless steel now, not all but most. The dye won't stick to the stainless steel. It will stick to any dirty you have on it but not to the metal itself. This way your shower won't look like you had a paint war in it and that means less clean up. Oh and try not to use shampoos with sulfates in them, they really strip the color out of your hair. It really does matter. üòä Have fun!‚ù§
