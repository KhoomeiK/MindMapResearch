Eugene,fqb0ig4,t3_ggsqdz,1589228453.0,"They get a lot of flak, but I found a pretty nice temp job with Personnel Source (temp agency). All I had to do was email them a resume, they called me and asked me what type of work I wanted, and essentially was hired for a temporary administration position. Obviously, the time varies, you can get for a few weeks, or it can be for a few months, but if you can't find it something solely for the summer, I would give them a try."

teenagers,fftoced,t1_ffsgr3d,1580225545.0,"Atypical anorexia is so tricky...I personally knew someone who had atypical anorexia, and she was at a healthy weight (honestly, she even looked pretty athletic). Many people who develop anorexia for a time will eventually develop binging (I was anorexic for a while, and then it turned into binging and purging)...it's very complicated. 

Another thing to consider is that some people who are at a healthier or higher weight might be diagnosed with Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) which is an eating disorder that isn't necessarily black-and-white anorexia or bulimia. Binge Eating Disorder falls into this category, orthorexia, purging disorder (not to be confused with bulimia), etc..."
teenagers,ffsgi7u,t1_ffsg7tw,1580181146.0,""" **Atypical anorexia nervosa** is defined by the DSM-V as an eating disorder wherein “all of the criteria for AN are met, except that despite significant weight loss, the individual's weight is within or above the normal range.” ""

And Macas35 insinuated that one has to ""look"" anorexic in order to have anorexia, with no knowledge about her actual body weight or health. And that simply isn't the case."
teenagers,ffseno2,t1_ffrytfo,1580179866.0,"Anorexia nervosa isn't a body type, it's an emotional disorder. Unless you have an emotional disorder where you have an obsession with losing weight and refuse to eat, you don't have anorexia...it doesn't matter how skinny you are."
Flute,ffs2bfy,t1_ffqsu8e,1580171398.0,"Ah, gotcha. That makes sense. An important factor I forgot to mention is how \*you\* feel about the price. If you are totally fine with their offered payment, then you should take it. :-)"
Flute,ffqqhs6,t3_eucqdo,1580141279.0,"Hi, there! So many factors need to be taken into account of what you charge, such as:

\-Are you and the flutist being paid together or separately? If she's being paid separately, how much is she getting?

\-Where is the wedding? I live on the West Coast and I can typically charge more here than when I'm visiting the Midwest. 

\-Who is the couple? Is this family/friends or strangers? I've done low-cost or even free gigs for family and close friends, but for strangers you need to be paid a good price. 

Yes, you don't want to charge as much as a professional, but you are putting a lot of work into this and you deserve a fair compensation. For two hours of actual playing plus time put into programming music, practicing, and rehearsal, I would ask for $150, at least. 

Hope this helps!"
BPD,ffcd2rw,t3_esu09q,1579796845.0,"I would punish myself through binging and purging. I was anorexic for a few years which eventually turned into bulimia with anorexic tendencies. If I felt sad, upset, angry, guilty, you name it, I would binge on sweets and junk food and then go throw it up. At my house, at school, in public...ugh.

I consider myself to be recovered, with years of therapy and close medical care, but every several weeks, I have a slip-up. 

Nowadays, if I feel myself getting anxious, I just won't eat. But starvation will eventually lead to a binge, so I put a stop to that."
BPD,ffafw49,t3_ernn21,1579734795.0,"Does anyone else have issues with maladaptive daydreaming? Definition here, because I finally learned the term for it, haha:

**Maladaptive daydreaming**, also known as excessive daydreaming, is a disordered form of dissociative [absorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(psychology)) associated with vivid and excessive [fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_(psychology)) activity that often involves elaborate and fanciful scenarios. It can result in [distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_(medicine)), can replace human interaction and may interfere with normal functioning such as social life or work.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maladaptive_daydreaming#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maladaptive_daydreaming#cite_note-2) People who suffer from maladaptive daydreaming can spend more than half their days in ""vivid alternative universes"". Maladaptive daydreaming is typically associated with stereotypical  movements, such as pacing or rocking, and the need for musical  stimulation.

I do it as a way to make myself feel sad, happy, mad, etc. And I'm always imagining that people are nearby, perhaps for their approval or just their attention."
BPD,ffafmp6,t3_es4b8r,1579734618.0,"Yes!! I definitely do this in conjunction with maladaptive daydreaming...I'll be imagining or daydreaming my scenarios, and there are ALWAYS people watching."
