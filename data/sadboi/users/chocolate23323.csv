StrongCurves,ff77onq,t1_ff6ukqz,1579642742.0,I just tried to download it! but I find that it doesn't have a place for notes (like if you substitute an exercise or do a different number of sets)
Anxiety,ff6qmd1,t3_erydv8,1579632837.0,"I also have GAD and used to have nausea every morning before going to school. I just had to work through it unfortunately and tell myself that it's just anxiety and there's no reason why I couldn't attend class. I wasn't having the best time at school, but I was too far into it to think about switching. Is there something about your job that's subconsciously bothering you? Maybe figuring that out will help. 

Definitely talk to your doctor. 

Would it help to start taking your medication at night so it covers you in the morning?"
Anxiety,ews5jc6,t1_ewrpe0p,1565720615.0,I use it rarely - only when the panic attack is severe. Knowing I have a way out of those attacks has definitely calmed me down a bit.
Anxiety,ews5fa2,t1_ewro56j,1565720552.0,I can't imagine taking Ativan every day. It really knocks me out.
Anxiety,ewrogs1,t1_ewrhefq,1565710210.0,"I’ve been having similar issues. One of my parents is ill and I get very anxious about it when I’m home (or when I don’t go home frequently enough.) but when I’m away from home and away from my family doing fun things, I go back to normal."
Anxiety,ewrnw2j,t3_cpufth,1565709842.0,I had a prescription for lorazepam and was also afraid to take it for a little while. But eventually the symptoms got so bad that I decided I’d rather deal with with whatever side effects I was afraid of than the anxiety. So i decided to take it. And guess what - no major side effects! I only took a half of a dose but it was enough. I felt a bit loopy for a while and a bit tired/lazy and i just wanted to sit on the couch and not talk. Chest pains started to go away. Panicky feeling went away. This medication was prescribed for me to use only when I’m experiencing a panic attack and not often.
Anxiety,ewqmi2o,t3_cplnee,1565670560.0,"I'm sorry you're going through this. I went through a similar thing today. I ended up taking an ativan to see if that would calm down the chest pain (and that's how I decided whether I'd go get it checked out or leave it alone). For the most part, it calmed down. That calmed me down."
Anxiety,ewqmabu,t3_cpnm8u,1565670351.0,"Anxiety can cause dizziness for a number of reasons. For one, when you're very anxious, you breathe differently and are often not letting in enough oxygen. This can cause chest tightening and lightheadedness. Try a slow breathing exercise. You can find some guided videos on YouTube, otherwise do something like breathe in slowly for 1-2-3-4, hold the air in your lungs for 1-2-3-4, and breathe out through your mouth 1-2-3-4. Do this repeatedly and make sure that when you breathe in, you're letting the stomach expand rather than the chest. (If you need a video, look for diaphramatic breathing.) 

&#x200B;

I have this issue sometimes. Sometimes it's related to oxygen intake, and other times my body is simply exhausted from all the adrenaline in my system, and that manifests in a variety of ways."
Anxiety,ewqg2so,t1_ewolj7w,1565665002.0,"What unwanted side effects were you experiencing? 

I find that drinking often makes my anxiety worse, especially when I start to get a hangover. (which is sad, because I love drinking.)"
Anxiety,ewqfujp,t3_cpc3zu,1565664826.0,"I go through phases where I'm prone to getting these feelings at any moment for no apparent reason. Those phases last for about 3-4 months and then go away for a while, sometimes years. But during those times I've always considered trying some sort of antidepressant, which my doctor says may help create a more calm baseline."
Anxiety,ewqfouz,t1_ewq0kq7,1565664702.0,"Me for YEARS! Held onto that bottle but was too afraid to take it. Finally took it and yes it made me feel a little weird, but usually makes my most distressing symptoms go away fairly quickly. I do have to limit myself on how often I take it."
Anxiety,ewqfgq2,t1_ewp90uh,1565664525.0,"When I first started getting panic attacks, they often happened while I was driving. I'd pull out of my neighborhood and as soon as I got on a busy street, BAM. Once I learned coping strategies, I decided I had to try to desensitise myself to driving. So I would drive for a little bit and then pull over at a gas station or shopping center, then resume driving when I felt like i could. During those times I never took the highway. I think it worked eventually."
Anxiety,ewqf8z1,t1_ewq557l,1565664359.0,"Same. Unfortunately the reason for that is that I watched a family member have a heart attack not too long ago. But I try to remember that I'm young and my heart has been tested and even though there is a \*sight\* possibility that the doctors could have missed something or that something could have developed since I was seen, I really am at very low risk. But of course when in panic mode, most of that reasoning goes down the drain."
Anxiety,eu7xw86,t1_eu73l4j,1563545455.0,"Thanks- I’m definitely not the best with screen time, but I usually don’t have problems sleeping. I’ve been having nightmares lately about a recent traumatic event, so maybe that’s contributing. 

When you say lorazepam is fantastic for fatigue, do you mean it helps minimize fatigue caused by anxiety? Everything I’ve read said that it can actually cause fatigue as a side effect. Also, I was directed to use it only while experiencing an acute panic attack to minimize dependency."
AnxietyDepression,eu6mcv7,t1_eu2ihqp,1563503618.0,"Has the xanax helped? I have a prescription and was also thinking of taking it to try to combat fatigue, even though I know it's not a stimulant."
AnxietyDepression,eu6lew9,t3_cesbpy,1563502985.0,"I also get symbolic triggers like that. For example when I was in college one year, I knew that as soon as the semester was over and I went home, my anxiety would go away and it did. A family member was in the hospital recently and I managed to keep it together, but literally the day he came home, my anxiety came back full force. You're not alone!"
