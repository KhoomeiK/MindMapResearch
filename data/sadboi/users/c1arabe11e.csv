Even if they were off a few points he was clearly academically gifted and doing high school work in their grade. It all seems reasonable to me.

AskReddit,fq5gi9k,t3_ggqw9w,1589104515.0,"How the prisoners of Sobibor concentration camp  escaped.

Unlike many other Nazi concentration camps, Sobibor existed for the sole purpose of exterminating Jews. Most new arrivals were immediately sent to the gas chambers, with rare exceptions being made for those who were forced to serve as slave labourers who assisted in the operation of the camp. Some 200,000 to 250,000[3] people were murdered at Sobibor,[4] making it the fourth deadliest extermination camp after Belzec, Treblinka, and Auschwitz.

Sobibor is notable for the prisoner revolt which occurred on 14 October 1943, an event which is often described as the most successful revolt ever to have taken place in a Nazi extermination camp. The plan for the revolt, which was developed by Alexander Pechersky and Leon Feldhendler, involved two phases. In the first phase, teams of prisoners were to assassinate all of the on-duty SS officers in discrete locations. In the second phase, all 600 prisoners would assemble for roll call and walk to freedom out the front gate. However, the revolt did not go as planned. The operation was discovered while several SS officers were still alive and prisoners ended up having to escape by climbing over barbed wire fences and running through a mine field under heavy machine gun fire. Even so, about 300 prisoners made it out of the camp, of whom roughly 60 survived to the end of the war."
