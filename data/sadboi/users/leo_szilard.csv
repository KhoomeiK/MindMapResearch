The person I posted this question for, doesn't like spice too much and they haven't had Indian food before. I was thinking maybe I introduce them to Indian food through Lentils(daal) with mild spices. I am assuming you are a non-desi, what was your first introduction to Indian food?"

ZeroWaste,es45zja,t1_es3bjil,1561577822.0,"A distinction has to be made when we say damage to the environment. Glass even though takes more energy to make isn't directly harmful for the environment. It's an inert material, whereas plastic is the just horrendous. It gets eaten up by animals, chokes them etc. You could say that glass has more carbon footprint which in turn will harm the environment, but the carbon foot print of an item can't be computed accurately. For example, a plastic bottle could have higher carbon footprint in addition to being highly toxic to environment as it could be coming from a country from where it has to be transported by sea and we know how energy intensive shipping industry is, whereas glass bottles could be coming from a local factory nearby.
We never know exactly what is the carbon footprint of the activity we are engaging in or product we are using. They are just estimates and calculated for a very large population and often fail while scaling down to individual."
