LesbianGamers,f3brkwn,t3_def94l,1570815315.0,I just recently started playing Minecraft but I’ve become extremely addicted to it already lol. I’m on Xbox and I do have a discord. I can look up my discord info and send it over if you’d like to play sometime.
gaymers,f0bj3bf,t3_d2xvc9,1568527721.0,"I have one that I’m active in that’s very down to earth and relaxed if you’d like to have an invite sent. If not, I play with a random group of people almost every evening and you’re welcome to join. We are adults and we are EP.  send me your gamer tag if either of those interest you."
depression,eznaenp,t3_cpidz8,1568003101.0,"For me, even the smallest chore or activity feels like climbing a mountain. It can be something as small as carrying something in from the car. I constantly feel like I have anchors weighing me down. And like yourself, all I want is to be at home. But once I get here, it’s just me. All by myself. So I’m glad I’m home, yet I have to face the fact that I’m 34 and single. I have convinced myself that I’m unloveable Bc of my mental health. It’s a rough life. But there are ppl here to talk to if you take the time to reach out. I hope things get better for you."
elderscrollsonline,ewnn5zc,t1_ewnn2vy,1565583338.0,Maybe after I get all my crafting out of the way. I have a ton of random house items in the bank that I need to do something with lol.
elderscrollsonline,ewnmva8,t3_cp6ewt,1565583070.0,I’m the same way. It seems like it gets pricey to furnish a home.
LesbianGamers,ev1j9cr,t1_ev1j58x,1564159548.0,I have a level 8 necromancer as well. It still needs a ton of work and time. I’ll add you. I’m on right now but will be logging off shortly. But I will be back on later in the day.
LesbianGamers,ev1fmed,t1_ev0j1dg,1564157457.0,Yep I have Elsweyr. I’ve already cleared it on my main but I’ve been wanting to make a sorcerer so maybe I’ll do that and level it up that way.
LesbianGamers,euzi9xm,t3_chteoe,1564120147.0,"If you play ESO, I’m on every day. Gamertag is xtwo8up4youx 🙂 Would love to have another friend to run dungeons/undaunted dailies with."

elderscrollsonline,erz74y0,t3_c4qype,1561427462.0,"I’m a quest junkie so I’m usually in the middle of one, but a few times recently I’ve stopped and enjoyed some fishing. One day I’ll have an angler achievement, but it sure won’t be any time soon. I hardly ever catch something rare lol"
redditgetsdrawn,erwdmft,t1_erwdb3w,1561340522.0,The talent in this group is impressive. These pictures have been so amazing to receive today. Had me excited every time my phone had an alert. Thank you for the work! It’s truly incredible. ❤️❤️

elderscrollsonline,ertvjcg,t3_c3oxow,1561254560.0,"The game never gets old for me. If you’re burnt out on story line quests, there’s the side quests. If you’re tired of quests period, you can farm for ingredients or supplies. You can do writs. You can fish. There’s literally so much to do in this game that I’m never tired of it. Unfortunately, al of my other gamer friends are into Fortnite and don’t share my love for ESO. So it’s always just me. Would love to get a group together sometime to help each other knock out all the world bosses in certain areas."
LesbianGamers,erpp83r,t3_as1wlq,1561124552.0,"I see that this post is a few months old but I’m on Xbox and play ESO quite a bit, usually nightly. I have two different characters, the most recent being a necromancer that’s still very new. Would love some friends to run quests with.  I mainly do PVE bc I also suffer from social anxiety. Would be cool to meet someone I feel comfortable talking to and gaming with. If you’re still playing, shoot me a message."
LesbianGamers,erj9tgz,t1_erj8igm,1560920490.0,Awesome! It’s 1am where I am but I’ll be on tomorrow evening. Thanks for the add.

elderscrollsonline,eox7w9f,t3_btbnk1,1558920276.0,"I play casually and absolutely love ESO. I play on my own, occasionally teaming with someone if I run into them and they appear to be doing the same quest line as I am. I haven’t even explored guilds. If you want a new friend, private message me and I’ll give you my info."

Wanted to get that umbrella before it was gone, and my usual team went to Sonic Temple for the weekend and I’ve been at it alone. To the OP, if you need people to play with, we have a group of adults that play most evenings. Just let me know."
