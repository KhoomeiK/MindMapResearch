depression,fpklng5,t3_gdv7qt,1588696884.0," Same here.

I tried to create many folders for each week, and do all of them one by one.
But my motivation is still lacking. I didn’t did much, but enough for not letting teachers “react”. 
Whenever I open one of the files, seeing all that work make me anxious and mind can’t think of anything. 
In the other hand, I SERIOUSLY cannot fail this class. Repeating the entire year... I’m too tired to do so. 
I’m still trying to get all the work done. I red that this year, no one’s gonna fail. This kinda helps me cheer up.

My advice is:

- create a notebook for every week.

- write everything you have to do (a group for each subject)

- do the work one by one, and when you did it, make sure to delete it. Seeing all the work “disappear” is satisfying.

- continue doing this until you did all the work.

If some work is more important than others, try doing that first. 

Since We are in the same boat, I can predict you’ll not feel motivated to do the work, just by looking at it. So... just do the one that is “comfortable”, first."
