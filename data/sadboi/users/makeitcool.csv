With FF I'm able to restore a sliver of hp and kite a bit better, and with Electrocute I can slow an enemy down + deal extra damage. Even with scaling I'm not confident AC is a versatile rune unless you're determined to finish the game super early with a lot of snowballing.

Having said that I don't judge teammates by their runes. No good can come of discussing it in game. If they meant to take it, then it's just demoralizing or will come across as patronizing. If they made a mistake, then it's just adding insult to injury."
