PublicFreakout,fiqeued,t3_f98ulp,1582642731.0,This is just...sad. It’s these type of people who die first in an apocalypse.
Showerthoughts,fhdxdlr,t3_f2ppis,1581506327.0,No shit?
AskReddit,fhdxcfn,t3_f2ppvj,1581506287.0,Sounds like you know the answer to that...
Showerthoughts,ffw3vbx,t3_evjopu,1580283169.0,How about contacts?

depression,erdkxp5,t3_c1j7wd,1560745660.0,See a therapist or talk to someone. Internet can’t help us. Real life interaction will.
Showerthoughts,erdkwf2,t3_c1j83l,1560745621.0,No it hasn’t 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️😂
Showerthoughts,erdkvir,t3_c1j86x,1560745596.0,I never slept with my parents. And it’s just weird if kids still do it past the age of 5. Kids will just grow into bigger snowflakes if they get to sleep with their mummy and daddy the minute they get scared.
pics,er7vhpn,t1_er7s97n,1560588930.0,Haha yeah and pigs fly 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️😂. Fucking kill yourself you worthless and pathetic kid.
pics,er7o8bn,t1_er7ktq2,1560582813.0,Wow who hurt you kid? Your mummy? Lol storms are beautiful and just because you don’t like them doesn’t mean “no one” does. You aren’t special. And yes my photography skills aren’t great but there are many amazing “Australian” photographers out there. Not to mention I didn’t realise how bad quality this was until I actually saw it posted. Probably because it’s from Snapchat. Plus it’s kinda hard for it to be sunny when it’s winter here and constantly raining 🙃Grow up boy and get out of your basement.
AskReddit,er7fpvu,t3_c0tvnv,1560576751.0,My regrets.
AskReddit,er7foar,t1_er7fc1d,1560576720.0,Who cares if people hate your or love you. The only persons opinion that matters about you is your own. If you live your life worrying about what others think you will never be happy or free.
AskReddit,er7flcy,t3_c0tvr1,1560576659.0,We feel lonely around people because we feel like no one truly understands us and we don’t belong. The only way to get over loneliness is to look within ourselves and fix whatever is broken.  I just can’t seem to do that.
AskReddit,er7fdxe,t3_c0tvzk,1560576499.0,They weren’t born with it. It’s some culture thing 🤦🏻‍♀️
AskReddit,eqqo4kk,t3_bz7smq,1560226448.0,"Well considering it's winter here, not very."
AskReddit,eqqnxkg,t3_bz7sq6,1560226272.0,"If I'm going the speed limit, or even slightly over and the car behind me is up my ass, I usually go below the speed limit and continue to slow down until they back off. Usually works. Or just ignore them and drive as if no one is behind you. The main thing is don't let them be the boss of you and pressure you into speeding. They will be the ones who get in trouble if they go into the back of you."
depression,eqqnmh3,t3_bz5d2z,1560225985.0,"So, so happy for you. I hope you never feel the need to write one again. You are amazing and so strong. And please talk to someone. You deserve to be happy."
depression,epfqvld,t1_epfqr1z,1559200233.0,Yeah. I kinda wish I could fake my death just to see if people really care like they claim.
depression,epfqjlj,t3_buq456,1559200095.0,"What I think as well. I’m only not seriously attempting it because I need to stay here for my mum. I do think it’s more I want to die, but I don’t want to kill myself."
depression,epfegzm,t3_bupglb,1559194969.0,"17 huh? I was 17 last year and attempted. Biggest mistake of my life. Got caught and now have to live with the guilt of the pain I put everyone involved though. Unless you can 100% guarantee you will die from whatever method you’re doing, it ain’t worth it. Get help. There will be a lot less shame from that than failing to take your own life."
AskReddit,epfamqc,t1_epfa5qy,1559193394.0,no.
depression,epf9lok,t1_epf6od6,1559192982.0,Yeah maybe. I was just worried the age part might make it a bit more weird.
depression,epf9h08,t1_epf6j4i,1559192934.0,"Okay, thank you."
depression,epf60il,t1_epf5wk2,1559191595.0,You sure the age part doesn't matter though?
