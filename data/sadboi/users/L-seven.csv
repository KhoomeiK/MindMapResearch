SuicideWatch,famhtb7,t3_e9ravk,1576204205.0,"Well, it certainly isn't normal or healthy. What you truly need isn't death but a major change in your life. Life isn't supposed to be this hard or dull. Wrong people, wrong environment, wrong lifestyle, wrong choices, wrong circumstances... whatever it is that makes you feel this way, identify the culprit. Then you'll know what you need to change to get your life back. Both your life and your will to live."
SuicideWatch,famfto9,t3_e9wji0,1576202836.0,"Give her a call. You said it yourself, you're not 7 anymore so pick up that phone like an adult that you are and dial her number. That her all of that. That you miss her. She's on your side. Reconnect. You clearly need both your mother and your brother back in your life, and they probably need you too. 

No need to alienate and punish yourself any further. Just because life didn't turn out how you wanted, doesn't mean you're worthless. With enough effort things can be turned around. Don't be so hard on yourself.

Also, reconnect with your friends. Send them emails, ask what's up, etc. I'm sure some of them really miss you and would love getting a message from you."
SuicideWatch,famb06p,t3_e9s2p9,1576199863.0,"Never too late, man. Better at 33 than 88. You still have plenty of time, you just need to make significant life changes instead of waiting for things to change. Being passive never gets you anywhere. Focus on your skills, interests and goals. Whatever it is that you wanna do in life, go for it. Just gotta be relentless."
SuicideWatch,fam9ui4,t3_e9suce,1576199052.0,"It does sound like you're saying that suicide is the only legit answer to you not getting support from your family/gf when it comes to your gender identity.

Your family is the starting point, then you grow up and you go find your tribe or continue as a lone wolf, whatever suits you.

You can be whoever you want to be, and whoever doesn't like that idea can suck it. You don't need anyone's approval. Be your own hero and protector instead of wanting to be protected. Some are blessed with supportive protectors, most aren't.

You wanna be a woman? Cool. You don't? Great. You're not sure? That's also fine.

You sound like a very very young person, it's normal you're confused and unsure, wanting one thing and starting the journey but still not taking the big step, then getting tired and drained from trying to please the people close to you who doesn't want the same for you. I get it.

Part of becoming an adult is realizing that nobody can verbally force you to be who you don't want to be or do anything you don't wanna do unless you let them. (Of course this doesn't apply to dangerous life-or-death situations when you're facing actual evil/violence and you do what you can to survive.) They never had to walk in your shoes so their point of view is off and thus their opinions aren't valid. Don't let anyone guilt-trip you into something that has such a negative effect on you that you're considering suicide.

The problems you have right now seem huge and tragic but these are the problems that have a solution. And not the ""things didn't go as planned so now I'm gonna kill myself because what else?"" 

You're tired so go get some rest. Get some fresh air. Relax. Stop thinking about what people might want from you. What they think of you. How they see you. It doesn't matter. It is your life. Take your time to slowly figure out what you want, and if you still don't know, that's fine. One day you will. People pleasers are the ones who always suffer the most. So focus on yourself.

If people aren't supportive, distance yourself for a while. Or figure out a way to stay in touch and be cool without mentioning the subject. And in the meantime still follow that vision of you that you have. Without trying to get them on your side.

People eventually get used to the idea when they see their tantrums don't make a difference and you're still on your chosen path. Someday they might even admit that they admire how relentless you were in pursuing that dream despite the lack of support."
SuicideWatch,falz97r,t3_e8gjky,1576193025.0,"Bad counselling irl can do more harm than good. Speaking from experience. The internet does seem like a safer idea.

Also, not all people know how to process or respond to traumatic events that happened to their loved ones. I for one have heard some really odd things, coming from my otherwise loving mother, which crushed me even more. Some things that in the eyes of the victim sound almost as ""well, maybe you should've done something to prevent it"". The behavior too. Or maybe I should call it ""let's pretend we never had this conversation"" like bad things never happened, you know? But that's what you might be getting if you open up years after the incident.

I've learnt the hard way that whatever you decide to do, do it right away. You do it after a couple of years, nobody gives a shit. You want them to go thru this with you, you tell them now. If you won't, you might as well never bring it up again, unless you're ready to be interrogated the most insensitive way with the classic ""why didn't you say anything right away?!"" that sounds like an accusation. Just lovely.

This will fuck you up a bit. The way you see people, relationships, law, justice, etc. will change. Your moral code will probably change. You will never be as innocent, trusting, careless or optimistic as before, but actually that's for the better. Assume the best but be prepared for the worst. Not all play by the rules. Or maybe there were never any rules to begin with and we just thought the world's filled with pink unicorns and happy puppies. Shit happens. We gotta toughen up and do our best to always be prepared, assess the situation and retaliate if given an opening.

Eventually you will move on. That's how life works. The feelings of disgust, extreme loneliness like you're the only one with such experience, being unable to talk about it, that stress mixed with apathy, and that heaviness that feels like something's crushing your chest making breathing so damn hard. That dull black mass of shittyness giving you anxiety and headache. And that feeling that right now you probably can't shake off... feeling empty, dirty, almost infected... It will all go away. At least for the most part. You'll label it ""shitty past"" and focus on the now, whatever it'll be. The world will become fun again, the colors and the meaning will return.

You'll grow up stronger than ever. A bit messed up but then again everyone is. But it won't become who you are. It won't become your label. It won't affect your identity. Your identity will change, evolve. Just like you will grow older and wiser.

I'm rambling but the point is, we're not thinking straight when we're emotional. We experience trauma and feel that this is the end of the world and the only thing left is suicide. People buy food and make jokes and enjoy their life like some kinda idiots, while we know the ugly truth of how bad things can get, and that in the end everything seems pointless. Yeah, yeah, been there.

Making plans, any plans, while highly emotional (aka the state of being a complete loony off the medication) is the worst idea ever. You just let it out as much as possible, physical activity is great for that. No sad music for more than one evening. Angry music is okay tho, go and throw some punches to the beat. Focus on healing and growing stronger. On you. Always remember that whatever happens, life is your priority. You lose an arm but you're still alive and kicking. You can still do fucking awesome things, so always have that in mind, that future point and that goal that will keep you going when you feel like you can't get over the past. You can and you will.

No matter how bad it gets, how shitty you feel, the state you're in won't remain the same. Nothing is static. Emotions come and go, we cry one moment and then we get up, hell, some even dare to laugh at some point. People here will always be willing to listenÂ if you need it. Breathe in. Just remember there is nothing more valuable than your own life and your future. The now might be in ruins but that doesn't mean the future will be too. Breathe out."
