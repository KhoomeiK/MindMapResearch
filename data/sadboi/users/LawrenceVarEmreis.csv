 I've been quarantined since March 17, and even if im not getting any pay from these days, im still kind of happy because i think i only felt kind of two days. It's AWESOME.  
 Even if im going to have some financial issues later, i realized that no money can pay for this feeling, because even if im quarantined, this is the first time in years that i feel free."

Anxiety,flzr0z7,t3_fs3yr2,1585630940.0,"Strength trainer here. Don't wait until gaining weight if you're not training because all you're going to gain is fat, even if you start drinking protein shakes.  


 I would start either with mma or working out, and then figuring out the weight gain part. And even then, you also need a caloric surplus to build muscle, it's not only about protein."
therapy,flfrtf4,t1_flfr8sn,1585115492.0," You know, i've gone through some really depressing times in my life, i remember walking in the street and being in that line of though ""Oh, that girls surely thinks im ugly"" ""Why does he look me like that? did i dress weird?/am i walkin right?"".  


 Some years later, and having much more confidence, i can tell you: they keep staring at me. People just watch other people.

 I just made a survey about that on instagram some weeks ago. Around 60% of my followers looked at strangers in the eyes while walking on the street.   
 Hope you can find some comfort in that because, well, people just look at each other."
therapy,flfqxdu,t3_fokj7b,1585114619.0," Hey. First, if someone tells other person to die, don't you think that actually says a lot about the first person? Depression makes us think everythink is our fault, our mistakes, and it generates the feeling of ""im worthless"", try to get out of it, at least for a second (i know it's something hard to do) and analyze the first situation logically, it might take a weight off you.   
 I mean, who would you love? Someone who just is confused and afraid, or someone who bullies people in vulnerable states? We both know the answer, and so does everybody else.  
 Then, why would that people be loved, and wouldn't you? I certainly value YOU more than any of those persons.  


 And back to the first topic. Do you actually feel like telling your parents? If you really do, tell them and don't think much about the consequences, don't let your anxiety play tricks before hand and make you think you're going to embarass yourself, because you're not. Just go and tell them what is going through your mind, tell them what you just wrote here, if you feel like letting them know.

 I hope you start to feel better, i care about you. If you feel like talking hit me up :)  
And don't forget to hug your best friend!"

therapy,fh6fxxv,t3_f1bwnx,1581298447.0," You just said so, ""she's a completely different person"". That person would not be someone you want around, not even someone you love. You may feel things for the memories you have with her, but if you try to go logically with this: this is not the person you love, or used to care about.

 I know it's painful man, im sorry you had to go through this. When my ex and i broke up, we met again two months later, and she told me she had sex with six different guys, and even did hard drugs. We were super close, she was the only friendship that i had and knowing that (and more) totally broke me. I know it's different, she didn't want to hurt me or anything, but i had these images (which luckily i didn't see) in my head for a lot of time.  
   
 Don't try to take vengeance or anything on any of them, just block. She's going to have a bad time being with a guy like that, and one day she might realize what she did.

Anxiety,fb8fvps,t3_ebuhgu,1576613015.0," Hey. I've had this line of thought. I had a strong anxiety attack that lasted for a month or so. At a certain point i started to think it was a physical health problem, i hoped it was, because i could find a solution. It lasted for about 45 days.   
 Four months have passed since this episode and now i realize it was a big fucking attack, i couldn't think, i could barely eat because it would make me feel bad in my stomach, i lost weight, it prevented me from going out.   
 I always hated the ""It will get better"" messages, because i never felt it would, but it finally did. And it certainly is much MUCH better now. 

 Try getting an appointment if you have the chance! Good luck with this, and feel free to message me if you need anything or just want to talk."

Anxiety,f943tf2,t3_e3lwuy,1575076523.0," I used to had this problem with the ceiling fangs and doors at work. At first i used to come back to check (everything was always ok). Later i started to double or triple check everything, but i always ended up coming back or just worrying a lot about everything.  
 What worked for me is being totally aware when im checking, like ""Ok, this damn fan is off, it is really off, and i want to remember this"". That's the only way i stopped suffering from it.   
 Months later i didn't have to keep worrying about it because i developed a routine for closing my workplace. And later i didn't even had to follow the routine because i knew i had been worrying for two years and i NEVER made a mistake.  


 There's not much you can do now besides going back to check it. But i hope it helps you tomorrow when you have to go through the same situation."

Anxiety,f7xa2lm,t3_dxupvs,1574050456.0,"  I kind of relate, so this might help.  
 I usually fear eating, because im used to feeling bad while doing so and my anxiety triggers before eating (vicious circle), so i can't take much food. Whenever i have to eat or someone talks to me about it, i start thinking ""Will i feel bad this time?"" and most times i do, just because of anxiety. I get some nausea, bloating and a urge to go to the bathroom.

 It's seem you also have this kind of fear. I think ""What if i eat this and i want to puke?"" that line of though makes me feel like puking.  You think ""I might try this solid food again, but what if i choke?"" and you start to choke.  
   
 Deep inside, you know that the problem is not ""real"", because what happened that time was just an accident, and now you just can't control your mind. My first suggestion to you would be to change the line of though.  Instead of going ""Oh, if i don't eat this i will starve, but if i do i will choke, what do i do?"" try to force yourself into thinking something **positive** and **real** in those situations, like ""Oh yes, finally, my favorite food"" and really feel the taste, enjoy it in your mind. Transform that ""negative"" anxiety into the positive ""Oh yes, this is happening"".   


  I just couldn't have a normal life, and my therapist suggested this to me for certain situations and it helped A LOT. I know the problems i create aren't ""real"", and so do you, even if they still appear. But once you really know this, you can try to change the line of thought in those situations.  


 You can still survive with liquid food, by the way, as long as you get your nutrients you will be healthy, so try not to lose your mind over it! You can take your time to solve this, so try to be chill about it, and if you can get someone to talk about this, it will surely help :)

Anxiety,f7c27z2,t3_dva3fd,1573582794.0," Kind of related, about changing the line of thought. If i get anxiety, for example, about seeing a girl, i automatically start thinking ""Oh shit, im gonna feel awful during the date and i will ruin it"" i've discovered that, instead, if i force myself into thinking ""Oh, im going to go out with that girl i like a lot!"" (which is true) the anxiety goes away. It is a really hard thing to do, but id did wonders to me in some situations, and i think it can be applied to a lot of anxiety situations."
Anxiety,f71rktz,t3_du43db,1573346562.0,"People have different experiences regarding panic attacks. When i get attacks my stomach takes all the beating, badly. A friend used to have such a high heart rate he felt he was going to die everytime, and this happened to him on EVERY BLOCK sometimes. Another person i know just can't breathe and lays down in the floor crying. Another one just cries.   
 And yes, it usually happens out of nowhere, and you just start worrying about it happening in any moment, that's the ugliest thing about panic attacks. Just keep in mind they are common, people just dont talk about it often. Go see a doc, it will surely help you. Good luck, and get better♥"

 Often i get thoughts like ""Why people can't appreciate they just can do everything so casually?"", i mean, i know it would sound weird to them because they usually think anxiety is just something you put aside and keep going with your life if you want to.   
 But the important thing is, in the end, you can do the same thing as them, it might take more time and effort, but you do. And you are caring for yourself, which is great."

Anxiety,f5kt635,t1_f5jpxwr,1572269612.0," In relation with those last lines, as i've said, im a instructor in a small gym, so im constantly a center of attention there. As of lately, i've had frequent anxiety attacks so i start walking fast around the whole place, lock myself in the bathroom or just have a weird behaviour. I've had these episodes more than 20 times in the last two months, and guess what NO ONE EVER NOTICED. 
 I tell you this just so you can rest on the fact that people will notice your hands shaking or you sweating, because im pretty sure they don't. Besides, that's something that usually happens to people working out.
 Have you talked to your doc about this weight loss - lithium issue?
 Im glad you're willing to try going back to the gym! Let me know how that goes, if you feel like it! And thanks to you for sharing this :)"
Anxiety,f5jnmx7,t1_f5jc3er,1572233787.0," I get your situation, it got hard because of the meds, it doesn't sound silly at all. 
 Keep in mind nobody judges others in the gym. Actually, no one even cares or notices other people, everyone is deep into their own training/friends/social media. And in the case anyone does, people will be supportive, most of us have started training because of mental issues (physical insecurities, most of the time), not overall physical health, even though no one says it.
 As i've recommended another member of this subreddit, you can always try a test day in any commercial gym, just start doing anything, even doing abs, and trying to stay there.
 Best outcome: you will realize no one cares about your body, or what you are doing, and the anxiety will slowly start fading away as the situation normalizes.
 Worst outcome: anxiety kicks in, you leave whenever you want, and you even have a bathroom at your disposal if you need it.

 If all these fails, you can first lose weight and go back to the gym. Keep in mind that you dont actually need a gym to lose weight. Just keep a caloric-deficit ""diet"" (please, talk with a professional to get healthy nutrition plan), and increase your daily activity, example: instead of using a car to drive 10 blocks to work, those are 20 blocks walked a day, and by the end of the month it makes a huge difference.
 Hope any of this helps, if you ever need to talk to someone feel free to message me :)"

Anxiety,f4a3wag,t1_f48ki6a,1571488587.0," Yeah, most people are too deep into their own problems so much that they can't even greet a customer nicely. Sometimes YOU can get them out of their situation and even make the situation better for yourself. It just happens, for example, some days are not the best for me (i've been suffering from anxiety attacks since im 10, 25 y/o now) and some stranger comes into the gym, greeting me with a smile and just being plain nice, telling me to have a nice day or anything, and something like that just gets me out of my shit and maybe i have a good day at work because of ONE person who was nice and broke an anxiety attack i was having.

 Remember that you also have power in those situation, and that a conversation, even a short one can change your day, and someone else's too."
Anxiety,f4a2gfm,t1_f48tql7,1571487981.0," This might sound strange to you, but i feel kind of awkward exercising in front of people that are close to me, and i've been lifting for eight years. Besides, most anxious people feel like you do, but once they are in a gym they realize that no one gives a shit about what anyone else is doing, so it is much less stressing. I would encourage you to go for a test day in any commercial local gym, you don't even have to talk to a instructor or anything, just hang around, get an ab mat and start doing crunches anywhere. You will realize no one even notices you, everyone is minding their own business. And if you, by any reason, start to feel anxious, just head to the exit :) Thanks for your comment!"

In any case, good luck with your appointment!

I just got into theraphy one month ago, and it is helping, really, really slow. But i helps to have someone to talk to. I usually want to cancel every appointment i have, with girls, friends, but im fighting not to cancel the ones that are supossed to help me. I encourage you to do the same, it's a huge temporary discomfort, but it is temporary, once you get close to your doc, and understand he wont judge you or anything negative, you will start to get a more ""normal"" feeling when going to meet him. Get a new appointment and try again :)"
Anxiety,f47hess,t3_djqpv5,1571422399.0," I work with people, im a gym instructor, and im always thinking about how important it is to be nice with everyone, specially patient, you never know what is happening to the person next to you. So it is really reassuring to read an experience like this, because i know how much i can do from MY side in my job, maybe someone can overcome their problems, just like you did, because i was patient and nice with them. I want to congratulate you for your progress and also thank you for sharing this, it helped me too. :)"

I have some violent pain in my right hip when i get to pararell in the squats, i think its the fascia lata tensor. It also hurts like hell if i flex the hip and internally rotate. I've been trying to massage with a tennis ball but it's not helping. It only hurts if its under tension, if someone lifts my leg and rotates it i don't feel anything, but if i do, or squat with an empty bar it really hurts. Kind of goes away when im really (REALLY) warmed up."
