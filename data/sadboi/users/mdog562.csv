schizophrenia,fqy82qm,t3_glll4q,1589744200.0,Seroquel. But I can only speak for atypical antipsychotics. Never been on typical antipsychotics
bipolar,fqvfejo,t3_gl5jxt,1589676116.0,Ssris and benzos can do that. I read online buspar can help with the ssris but I've never tried it
bipolar,fnxybdv,t3_g4hxor,1587349016.0,It hurts my heart when I see some of the posts on antipsychiatry. Some of those posts are clearly delusional and other people will reinforce the delusions.
bipolar,fnu7v21,t3_g3y62b,1587256351.0,I've been on it before. It can make you very tired and hungry but for me that was dose dependent
Psoriasis,fnbwg8h,t3_g0v0wz,1586823680.0,I feel that in my soul. All I can do is act like I don't care but deep down inside I do.
MemantineHCl,fnbw7g3,t1_fnbp7ka,1586823542.0,They could show up same with memantine. But depending on which country you some nootropics are prescription medications. For example memantine is a prescription drug in the USA. Which is very weird because you can easily buy it with out one.
MemantineHCl,fnbia4x,t3_g0shks,1586816014.0,I recently started counseling. They said if I were to get drug tested it would be $20. When I was on probation and had to do substance abuse classes the classes also charged $20 for a drug test. Both are dip stick tests. So for that price I'd assume it is gcms. If I could make a suggestion for nootropics personally I liked noopept and a choline source. Racetams are also good for clearing your head but some of them can be stimulating and make you feel uncomfortable. A good choline source is a great way to start. They can sometimes be a little pricy though

Psoriasis,fmxgt8v,t3_fxz5hm,1586464716.0,One dermatologist told to put steroids on my cuticles. I never tried it though

bipolar,fl7907o,t3_fmpgjm,1584896838.0,I don't know about lithium but antipsychotics in general can make Adderall less effective.
schizophrenia,fl78ryz,t1_fl78lx7,1584896699.0,It's like restlessness that won't go away. That's my experience.
schizophrenia,fl76gz8,t3_fn1gt6,1584895295.0,Abilify helped me aside from the akathasia. For the appetite you can try eating more meals that are smaller throughout the day.
bipolar,fl760zs,t3_fn2bxm,1584895021.0,It really depends on the person. My psych told me she met bipolar patients that weed helped them and patients that weed made them crazy and end up in the hospital. Personally weed makes me feel more off long term than lsd does. Also check medication interactions. But the safest thing to do is to do nothing.
bipolar,fk9by2o,t3_fh7b36,1583972933.0,Strattera can increase your heart since it affects norepinephrine.
bipolar,fk98bgb,t3_fh52l0,1583970787.0,I like vraylar. It took a bit for 8t to start working for me but when it did it helped tremendously. I don't really notice any side effects.

Psychosis,fjvedci,t3_ff3vfl,1583626269.0,For some people yes. You shouldn't do drugs that do that to you but tbh that doesn't stop me.

bipolar,fjpf0o4,t3_feglos,1583549090.0,a lot of the posts I see are clearly delusional. I understand why some people hate medication though.
bipolar,fjpetxg,t3_fegs5v,1583548956.0,I haven't gained much weight on it. I am on other medications that I know make me more hungry though. At first it made me tired but when that went away I get almost no side effects from it. Everyone is different though. I look at the FDA prescribing info and compared to other antipsychotics it seems like it less likely to cause extrapyramidal side effects. I could have just been misinterpreting it though
schizophrenia,fjpeevd,t3_fegxt6,1583548657.0,8 feel like some medications did this to me aswell as worsening my negative symptoms
bipolar,fjpe1x8,t3_fehsvu,1583548399.0,They put me on depakote when I was hospitalized once. I skipped all the therapy because I would sleep through it. I stopped taking but on other meds that made me sleepy it went away with time
schizophrenia,fjpcwb2,t3_fejh6y,1583547570.0,"When I first started risperidone I had that. I think it was because they started me off on 3mg, which was way to much for me, instead of titrating the dose."
bipolar,fjpcqh4,t3_fejx8e,1583547453.0,Buspar helps me but I need high doses of it. Ive been to therapy and they taught me some shit like deep breathing and muscle relaxation. All it did was keep me borderlining a panic attack instead of having a panic attack. I also take benzos for panic attacks but that is a last resort for me.
bipolar,fjpcfsy,t3_fejy3v,1583547238.0,I noticed some antipsychotics like risperidone and paliperidone would make me quick to anger.
bipolar,fjpcahk,t3_fekn5x,1583547133.0,I found it calming because my previous diagnosis didn't explain all of my symptoms. Being diagnosed schizoaffective bipolar type helped me better recognize triggers.
Psoriasis,fjpc0fp,t3_fekxre,1583546932.0,I have that problem too. I find that putting hydrogen peroxide in my ears helps loosen the scales

bipolar,fjpbp9p,t3_felhqq,1583546711.0,"Marijuana occasionally makes me manic. If I take a lot of benzos I get manic, which is very odd since they are supposed to help with that. Benzos can also have a rebound effect."
Psychosis,fjpbg7q,t3_fellxr,1583546533.0,I believe in ghosts too. Ive had some odd experiences. Like when I went to St Augustine I took photos and there was a yellow mist right next to about the height of a person. I do have schizoaffective though but I had photographic proof until I got a new phone. You should try to tread carefully. Even though other people experience it to you can never be sure
schizophrenia,fjpb57w,t3_felvzl,1583546319.0,Idk know how it began but 8 guess it could've been from abuse. My dad was an asshole when I was growing up. He beat us. Don't get me wrong we would do bad stuff but it seemed completely unnecessary and he'd often take it too far. He'd also try to scare us by telling us about demons and would scratch at our door at night and knock on the walls 3x every so often. It started off when I was a kid hallucinating my dad yelling then when I started getting into my teens I thought demons were following me and they were the reason that I was so fucked up.
bipolar,fjpan6l,t3_femclb,1583545971.0,That sounds like a mixed episode

bipolar,fjp9wug,t3_fenj9v,1583545449.0,Maybe try a different pharmacy? When I went to Walgreens vraylar cost me $200 a month. When I went to CVS it cost me $15. I don't understand the huge price difference

Antipsychiatry,fjp7ybi,t3_fenbgd,1583544050.0,If it's an injection there isn't much you can do. If you have to take them and your getting a lot of side effects all you can do is try to get your psych to lower your dosage

Antipsychiatry,fjijgpg,t3_fct36h,1583368987.0,I hate how doctors don't tell you the risk of stopping untill you want to stop
Antipsychiatry,fjijbjw,t3_fcw2rc,1583368899.0,Usually if you are forced to get an injection it's because you are acting out. the stronger injections do knock you out. Never had this happen to me but I've seen it happen to people inpatient who were very aggressive.
Antipsychiatry,fjiii67,t3_fdaq0p,1583368378.0,That is a side effect of both. If you want to stop find another doctor. Stopping antipsychotics cold turkey can cause psychotic symptoms.
schizophrenia,fjbrtn8,t3_fcmdeg,1583200026.0,Abilify worked well for me. I experienced akathasia on it though
schizophrenia,fjahju5,t3_fcaehl,1583173631.0,I have a decent amount of friends but none of them are good friends. I occasionally talk to them but I don't see the point. They always say we need to hangout more but never invite me to anything.
bipolar,fj8wrq1,t1_fj822xt,1583124403.0,"The only meds I've seen that work for bipolar that can be injected are risperidone, airipiprazole, and paliperidone. They cost much more than the oral versions"
bipolar,fj8s3t4,t3_fbviy6,1583120774.0,For me it got better after a few weeks. Didn't go completely away though.
Psoriasis,fj8lm23,t3_fc2g6y,1583116267.0,I'm sure they will understand since people with psoriasis are more likely to be deppressed. They probably won't be able to do much tho.
schizoaffective,fj2qcvc,t3_fb751n,1582950661.0,I don't check my blood sugar but if I havent eaten for a while I get super anxious.
bipolar,fj2hwir,t3_fb5a9a,1582944095.0,If it makes you feel like that your probably taking too much. I occasionally take a different beta blocker and I take half of the lowest dose cuz a whole dose makes me feel light headed.

bipolar,fizeo0p,t3_famu86,1582860893.0,When I started vraylar it made me pretty tired so I started to take it at night. It went away after a few months
bipolar,fize5iy,t3_fanord,1582860539.0,"Personally benzos make me manic if I take a lot, a lot being a few doses which I am on the lowest adult dose. I talked to people on r/benzodiazepines and there are people that have had similar experiences. Some say it even makes them deppressed."
schizophrenia,fiw53ki,t1_fiw4u3z,1582775393.0,I with you on that.
bipolar,firp4es,t3_f9hr7m,1582668663.0,I love vraylar. I get almost no side effects from it. The biggest problem I had was that I took a while to really fee l the full effect
bipolar,fipc3d1,t3_f90t25,1582602916.0,It works for me. The only side effects I get are memory problems and a slight foggy feeling. I am on 300mg. Currently trying to get my psych to decrease the dose.
bipolar,fip6q33,t3_f8btl5,1582599243.0,I agree with you. Klonopin is okay but it doesn't beat Xanax. I was on Ativan before and Klonopin before that. I asked my psych to be back on benzos after taking a break for a few months. I asked for Xanax and she gave it to me.
schizoaffective,fip66ar,t3_f8cgtb,1582598905.0,I haven't gained weight on vraylar. Geodon is supposed to be weight neutral.

schizoaffective,fip37z8,t3_f8jvnc,1582597034.0,I have not been on Valium but I have been on other benzos. Personally the drowsiness only went away when I started developing a tolerance. You could ask your doc about a benzo that's less hypnotic if you really need it.
bipolar,fioojrn,t1_fiooe9v,1582587367.0,I've seen posts on here where people said the got manic episodes from mood stabilizers. Personally lamotrigine made me deppressed at first but it went away

bipolar,fiolnrl,t3_f8osbn,1582585668.0,You sure it's loratadine because that med is for allergies.
schizophrenia,fiol7vr,t3_f8qsnx,1582585423.0,It really depends on the person. Personally stimulants dont really cause psychosis for me but I'm stable on meds and I rarely ever do it. Just don't do it. It isn't worth the risk.
schizophrenia,fiok4yq,t3_f8qzgx,1582584853.0,"Dopamine partial agonists ime are best for negative symptoms. Like abilify, vraylar, or rexulti. I haven't tried rexulti but abilify and vraylar are the only meds that helped with my negative symptoms. Stimulants that affect dopamine, like Wellbutrin, Adderall, Ritalin, can help but have the risk of inducing psychosis."
bipolar,fioi3px,t3_f8whi6,1582583795.0,Adderall stimulates dopamine receptors. Antipsychotics block dopamine receptors so it is very likely that is the case
bipolar,fiohqj4,t3_f8xwit,1582583578.0,If I smoke to much weed it sometimes makes me manic and hallucinate. If I just smoke a little it helps me calm down a bit. But I also noticed if I don't smoke for awhile I start to get really deppressed.
bipolar,fi24tqb,t1_fi22ned,1582071483.0,Sometimes I don't. Occasionally I will when I feel down
bipolar,fi1kjxv,t3_f5wjs3,1582059542.0,I'm the exact opposite. I get manic.
schizophrenia,fhu5xzt,t1_fhtv76s,1581882346.0,Lessened but not completely gone.
bipolar,fhrfhdc,t3_f4jkg4,1581824883.0,I was on Seroquel a few times. Everytime I required a higher dose over time until i maxed out the dosage. This didn't happen with other antipsychotics. You should always taper the dosage with antipsychotics.
bipolar,fhrexw3,t3_f4jkvm,1581824504.0,I gained around 40 pounds but I was very under weight. The biggest thing I noticed was increased appetite and the meds can slow your metabolism as well.
schizoaffective,fhreqol,t3_f4jxpr,1581824360.0,I am a male and I have larger breasts than I used to because of risperidone. My psych took me off of it because they said I'd start lactating. If it's that big of an issue dopamine partial agonists are less likely to cause this.
schizophrenia,fhredis,t1_fhr9p6i,1581824113.0,I was in a similar situation as a minor. My advice is do what benefits you the most. I love my parents but I wish I would have talked to the social workers more.
