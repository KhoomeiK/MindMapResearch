Get a rice cooker with a steam basket, throw in rice, beans, veggies, frozen cooked meat, and then whatever seasoning and additional ingredients for whatever flavor you're goin for. Hit start then go do something for 20 minutes. It's cheap, easy, and really good for you.

I make Mexican rice mixing the dry rice with some olive oil, sazon, sofrito, agave nectar, a little oregano and pepper, and replace a little of the rice water with apple cider vinegar and lime juice. I throw some frozen onion and pepper mix in the steamer basket, along with some black beans and cooked frozen chicken breast cubes.

Hit start then go take a shower. Dinner's ready when I'm out of the shower.

You can mix and match so many things to get a good meal.

For some Asian rice throw some plain rice in the cooker, with frozen cooked chicken breast and Asian vegetables in the steamer basket. Teriyaki sauce is just water, soy sauce and sugar. Add some garlic and ginger for flavor. Orange sauce is replacing the water with orange juice. Sesame sauce is add sesame oil. While the rice is cooking, mix the sauce ingredients in a pot on low, stirring slowly and pretty much constantly to thicken the sauce. And/or you can cheat with cornstarch. 

Put the veggies on the rice, the chicken on the veggies, and the sauce on the chicken. You now have teriyaki or orange or sesame chicken. Kind of. Obviously this isn't Michelin star eating. It's just steamed rice, vegetables, meat, and flavor. But it's delicious.

Taking a dog to a dog park is actually an *amazing* act for the dog and human alike. It allows the dog to socialize, which is very important in their training. They also get *tons* of exercise, which is important; but more so for certain breeds like working breeds, such as Huskies or the various Shepherds. Without this exercise they can succumb to depression or become hostile, or find their own outlet for their energy and intelligence (yummy couch cushions, for example).

It's great for the human as well. It provides more numerous and greater opportunities for training. Plus, there's tons of dogs! Which is great! That one dog that brings their fetch toy to each person at the park is always a great laugh.

Dog parks are great fun. You don't even need to have a dog to go to one! Just go and play with people's dogs! :)

Since we're on the topic, though, I'll say that if you've recently been to a dog park, and then go to enter a home which has a puppy; leave your shoes outside the door."

The risk of the grounds being infected is too damn high, imo. Maybe train them with pee pads, and don't let them walk around on the grounds; this risk is up to you. CPV is *highly* contagious with an untreated mortality rate above 90%.  
Get your puppy immunized and boosted ASAP. If you ever find your puppy lethargic, vomiting, and/or with diarrhea; take them to the vet *immediately* (I believe this was the biggest factor in saving my Husky's life). Coronavirus doesn't hold the most macabre of candles to Canine Parvovirus.

That's a funky chord. Sounds like something Ghost would play when fingerpicked. Sounds terrible strummed, though. lol

That's not a minor though... lemme work out the voicings... I'll edit this comment in a bit.

The eight fret 4th string contrasts with the open 5th. In standard tuning (I play a step down), that makes a Bb/A# which is dissonant to the open 5th's A. The 8th-fret 4rd string is an Eb/D#, which makes the C minor... but the open E makes it major... 8th fret on the 3rd string is a G; the 5th of C; so that's fine.

What you're playing here is a Cdim7 with an added major third and diminished 7th on top of a dominant 7th- hence the dissonance. You're playing a major *and* and minor third, with a dominant \*and\* minor 7th; hence further dissonance. This makes sense why it sounds interesting when fingerpicked (the notes hit individually), but terrible strummed. Too much dissonance.

Are you sure it's everything fretted on the 8th, except for the 5th and 1st strings?

If your looper pedal has a metronome function, use it. I've been playing for over twenty years, but even I miss a beat by a few milliseconds every now and then when going by my own internal metronome.

If you're playing without the metronome, the looper pedal should average out a beat for you if you start and stop it correctly.

However, the Dalai Lama shows us what it means to be Buddhist (perhaps within the Gelugpa tradition anyway, but most of his actions are universal across all lineages; we all share common bonds).

After researching this, I understand it is considered a quintessential classic. I read an excerpt of the David Hawkes translation, and was immediately transported into the story. I just got book one of the five-part English translation by David Hawkes on my Kindle. I'm sure it's going to be a great read.

Thanks again!"

I for one (hopefully: most) am eternally grateful for your sacrifice; even if said sacrifice is wearing cumbersome equipment."
politics,fkv070w,t1_fkur2oh,1584559444.0,"I worked at Wendy's in Albuquerque back in 05. iirc, the franchise was called Double Cheeseburger, Inc..

Amazing group of guys. I was always getting raises. The guys who ran the franchise got to know every employee when they could. They'd at least learn every new employee's name when they came out to the stores. If they learned it, they'd remember it the next time they came in. I called the head office a little less than a year after I moved out of state to give them my address to receive my W-2. The person who answered the phone even remembered me. We chatted for a bit.

One time some employees and I were walking home after a shift, and a sandstorm hit. One of the co-owners jumped in his car, chased us down, and gave us all rides home.

One time I was a few minutes late for work. This was unlike me, so my boss ran out of the store to come find me. I met him maybe ¼ mile from the store, with him still in his apron and wearing the drive-thru headset. He was worried I had gotten hit by a car.


Not every franchise is the same.


I'll expand upon that and tell you that nothing is the same as it's contemporaries. Whether it's franchises, dogs, Liberals, Conservatives, black people, white people, teenagers, middle-agers, whatever. None of them are the same.

Throwing things into groups for which we have preexisting biases is a dangerous practice. Everything deserves its own individual consideration; without the stigma of whatever group we've placed it in."

translator,fkfabxf,t3_fi5ch8,1584130154.0,"Little backstory: I bought a xiao flute from an online retailer, but they sent me a dizi flute. They were very confused when I informed them of their mistake. Their most recent reply accepted the mistake by saying ""This is a flute, not a flute."" I'm afraid that maybe ""xiao"" and ""dizi"" simply translate to ""flute"" for them with whatever translator they are using.

I would like to maybe clarify this for them with the translated response.

I hope this isn't too big of a request. I've tried to keep it as brief as possible, so as to not take up too much of anyone's time.

I'm hoping seeing the Chinese characters for ""dizi"" and ""xiao"" next to their Latin counterparts will help them clarify the product listing.

Thank you very very much for your help in helping the seller and me come to an understanding. It's difficult to express how much I appreciate it."

I won't call her a liar, and her stories definitely give me concern and drive me to scrutinize his intentions. But he honestly seems to be doing mostly good things as Pope. Maybe he understands the actual import of his position and chose to rise to it? idk. We live in strange times."
