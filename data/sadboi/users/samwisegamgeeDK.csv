While you describe lacking both, I believe that they are inseperable and it seems to me you feel the same way, which is why you are suffering so much, since you are lacking both.

Besides this, there is also knowing which love language is yours. They come in the form of words, favours and touching, if I remember correctly. If you know your and her language(s), you will know better how to convey your feelings.

The above is to say, that I fully understand why you are feeling like she is pulling away from you. 
I cant explain why she is doing this or how to fix this, as this seems like your preference.

I think you need to think of yourself and how her actions are influencing you, and whether you can be with a person who acts like this.
Consider if taking a break, or seeking out councelling might be helpful.

I used her as an emotional crutch, and since she didnt reciprocate these imaginary feelings and words, I became hurt and ruined something that was probably not a good idea to begin with. I did have real feelings for her, but they were eclipsed by my own flaws. Afterwards I have realized that all my relationships have worked in this manner, with me as the antagonist, not protagonist.
