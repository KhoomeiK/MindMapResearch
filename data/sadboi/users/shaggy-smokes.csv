One other thing I didn't mention is depression often follows manic episodes (basically [serious simplification here] because you burn through certain neurochemicals so quickly when manic and you run out), so watch out for the pattern, too. Sometimes folks consider their manic symptoms to not be serious w/o putting together that they get depressed every time the mania ends.

BipolarReddit,fohr94j,t3_g7htaj,1587771107.0,"This is always an interesting thing to me. What you're describing sounds like my hypomania, which is very much not on the level of my mania. Given your description and that it happened right after getting antidepressants, it sounds like you're probably bipolar (not a doctor, but getting manic after antidepressants seems to be when most psychiatrists start reaching for the mood stabilizers). BUT it doesn't sound like your 'ups' are causing you any problems (assuming you've told us everything, and you would be far from the first of us to try and hide symptoms so we don't have to go back down). Some people just don't experience mania as strongly and (from my understanding) treatment is congruent within its interference with your ability to function.

So my only advice is to keep your doctor in the loop and be on the look out in case your 'ups' DO start causing problems. By being honest with yourself and your doctor the two of you can decide your treatment together."

Meds are absolutely a factor in a lot of cases, but I think it's common for us regardless of whether or not we're medicated.

BipolarReddit,fnyg6sy,t3_g4hbew,1587362128.0,"Late to the game, but I believe it's simply due to a neurochemical imbalance. Sleep helps regulate our brain because it uses that time to do ""maintenance"" on itself. Similar to other triggers, w/o that regulation we can get pumped with chemicals like serotonin, dopamine, and even adrenaline. So while we should be tired, these chemicals keep us awake and energized. Additionally, it's normal to sleep daily and if we don't our brain is going ""woah, something's up so I better keep awake because something is wrong and I have to be ready and awake for it"", even if we're not actively, in our logical brain, worried or in danger. 

Not a psychologist or psychiatrist, but that's my take/understanding."

Maybe some Huskies don't do this so much, I suppose. I still wouldn't want him to stop talking to me! If this is a problem with OP, then I think they should get a GS (I've never had a GS pupper. They might howl just as much). It's ok to want a quieter dog, OP should be aware of this, though."

Regardless, I don't expect you'll actually do this, but try picking a shithole country and just browse their wikipedia article for a few minutes.
