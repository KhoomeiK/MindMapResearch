It took three years, my step daughter becoming a legal adult and telling I was being gaslit. Then police telling me I was being abused plus child protective services telling me accept the police's offer to remove her.

Then about two months without contact with her have I accepted I was being gaslit.

She got me, she got me real good.

I am a pretty self aware person but my blind spot for her was planet sized and it literally took having to chose between her and my daughters to see her for who she really was.
