i used to have a clarinet teacher (and he only showed up like 50% of the timeüòï) but he quit with me :/ i got back with him again for about a couple months, but then he quit again because he said that he‚Äôs busy :/ but he was helpful, & he suggested warmups, mouthpiece, ligature and reed recommendations, many recommendations of clarinetists to listen to on the internet, he assisted with scales and music in band, etc."

I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care.
