When i had knee problems post surgery i went to see a new doctor as my family doctor was sick and no longer practicing. So the new doctor assumed i was just trying to get pain med for the pain i was feeling after so long. Turned out to be scar tissue on the mcl no big deal. Wait times was 3 months for ACL surgery after 3 months to see the specialist, so 6 months total. Is that long.... maybe i didn't find it too bad. Bill costed me nothing so that's great. beyond that after surgery drugs were covered knee brace was covered for 250$ models ranged from 250-1200 or so. 

I saw the bill that the surgeon or office charged that was cool, was like 10k or so not sure it was like 9 years ago now. For whatever reason the Surgeon likes to talk to you right after you wake up so its a blur but showed me images of the internal ligaments and went over what was done. 

A friend of mine tore his knee cartilage and got it fixed in 3 days. mine took 6 months so the numbers can vary greatly, especially if your schedule isn't flexible. His was so when a cancellation came in he took the spot.

Overall though Single payer has got to be the best way to fix the price problem in US healthcare. Its crazy to think that you can't even estimate the costs in US when you ask them because they don't know and there are so many variables."
