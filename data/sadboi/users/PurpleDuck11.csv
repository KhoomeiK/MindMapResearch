BPD,fpoty6n,t1_fpmji6r,1588790610.0,"I’m also both bipolar and borderline and it’s awful. A lot of the symptoms do overlap but I can feel very distinct periods of mania/depression, plus a lot of mixed episodes. I’m constantly splitting on the people I love and I have absolutely no idea who I really am. It’s hard for me to have friends because I always end up of the average of the company I keep and then I have no sense of identity. It’s very frustrating. And the worst part is when you have no idea if you truly like someone, or if you’re just manic. So many times I thought I was really into someone and started a relationship, then the mania wore off and I didn’t like them anymore =/"

alcoholism,ffw13p1,t1_ffvhrbm,1580279949.0,"I get this 100%. I feel like I can’t do anything without alcohol now. I’m constantly irritated by my surroundings and my negativity rubs off on people, but when I drink, I’m happy and carefree and feel like I can actually be around my family. When I don’t, I hibernate in my house and don’t shower for days. I’ve been teetering on a fine line between “functional alcoholic” and “literally about to destroy my life at any given second” for far too long. That’s my incentive for quitting. Along with the fact that I don’t want to need to be buzzed to enjoy my life. 

I’m so sorry for everything that you’re going through, but try not to have resentment towards your family. It is what it is, it can’t be changed. The best thing you can do is try to change your perspective and think about all the things you’re grateful for instead of wishing things were different.

alcoholism,ffvn7sx,t3_evgkkd,1580268108.0,"All I can say is be careful. I’m ten years older than you and my family also has a history of alcoholism. I’ve been warned about it since I was young, but didn’t take it seriously and I’ve almost destroyed my life more times than I can count. Never thinking that alcohol was a problem, and that I just made “one” mistake.

I’m not saying that this will happen to you, or that you shouldn’t drink at all, but please be careful because it is so easy to go from just a few drinks a week to literally not remembering the last day you went without a drink. And take it from someone that spent 5 years of her life drinking every single day, once you stop, life seems very, very dull and it is an *extremely* hard cycle to break. 

Not to mention you are also very young. Alcohol can be a lot of fun when used in moderation and responsibly, but god I wish I had listened when I was your age and people tried to warn me how much of an effect alcohol has on a growing brain. 

I hope this helps somewhat and if you need anyone to talk to, please feel free to message me =)"

AmItheAsshole,felsif5,t1_felq6m4,1579229847.0,"Exactly. Was never disagreeing. I’m sure the family didn’t think about the wedding at all which is completely understandable.

There is no harm in *trying*. I have all the sympathy in the world for the grieving family, but relationships are all about give and take. If they truly could not have it any other time, then yes I agree he should go with her to the funeral."
