depression,es2flbb,t3_c5j15l,1561522745.0,"Each person today had each day previous to reach that point. Some people had a lot of help, some people had none. Some people experienced tragedy, some have lived a calm life. These things aren't usually visible. It's no use to compare yourself to them because your backstory will never be the same, you aren't standing on the same building blocks.

Best thing to do is try to achieve one good thing a day. Do one thing your future self will appreciate, dishes, a dollar in the savings account. 

Today I had this potato meat thing casserole at work with two eggs on top and it was awesome. Otherwise I achieved nothing of worth today. But I got to eat that bomb meal. That's living my best life.

Best to you."
AskReddit,es11p4u,t1_erzfrnt,1561487393.0,"Flying is absolutely the coolest, calmest experience. Planes are so damn reliable. I experience a hundred times more anxiety being in a car under calm circumstances than I experienced when I almost flubbed a landing in a 4-seater. 

If you haven't actually flown yourself before, get a discovery flight sometime. Mine was like $99, and I got to land the plane which I didn't expect. After that I was hooked."

From your post it sounds like you hate everything about her lifestyle. Also sounds like you want her to sacrifice her whole lifestyle for the sake of your wants and what you consider ""nice"". Girl has built a wonderful space for herself and all you can really do is talk shit and try and drag her somewhere you consider proper.

Check your perspective man."
