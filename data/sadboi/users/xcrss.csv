depression,f7mvm12,t3_dx1bsx,1573875112.0,"i feel the same. despite what people say, i can never find anyone. i dont know what to do, and ive found that being positive and lying to myself and others is my coping mechanism. i dont know what to do. its just been really lonely and i dont know how to get to where i want to be.

i feel that my ""glass is half full"" because of several things, and so i cant bring myself to be in a relationship."
