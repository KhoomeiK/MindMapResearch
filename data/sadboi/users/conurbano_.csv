Entre a la uba con una base tranqui pero bien de matematica (o sea no estaba RE perdido como otros que cursaban conmigo) pero me llevo puesto para bien la diferencia que hay entre como explican el mismo concepto en la facultad (por ejemplo una pelotudes que por que pasas de un lado de la ecuacion al otro con el signo cambiado) tan diferente y de una manera que te interesa comparado con el colegio, donde lo haces porque hay que hacerlo asi y punto. Supongo que no todos los colegios/profesores son iguales pero eso me rompio mucho las bolas, hubiera prestado muchisima mas atencion.

Tambien no es para echarle toda la culpa a la institucion y profes, la realidad es que eramos todos unos PENDEJOS DE MIERDA que casi rozaba con el bullying lo que le haciamos a algunos profesores, me acuerdo de eso y me da ganas de entrar y ponernme un sopapo para rescatarme. Quizas eso le sacaba las ganas de enseñarnos posta.

Mi curso fue uno de los primeros que empezaron a hacer upd y esa shit (ahora se escabian hasta para celebrar el ultimo primer dia de educacion fisica mas o menos) Hace poco fui a filmar un upd de un colegio de la zona y amigo, ajjajaja estaban del orto los pendejos y de ahi directo a clases, no digo de ser un ortiba pero en mi camada a pesar  de que terminamos re puestos al menos lls padres y profesores no les cabia para nada, aca los padres estaban cagandose de risa todo lo mas normal.

In your post you were talking about really dark stuff, if i were part of your support group and you told me something like that i would help you find help (sorry not a native speaker). Maybe you aren’t going to do anything stupid but i got bad vibes from reading your post. Maybe you were just talking about how it’s useless to worry about things because we all will eventually die, but when you said “or the damage you leave behind” it worried me.

About your religion, i’m really sad to hear about them not being able to openly talk about mental health, that is just plain backwards. I hope you at least get something from belonging to that group. Personally, I believe that god or whatever being you believe in is independent from religions down here on earth, I was a catholic from a young age and i always felt uncomfortable with the way the church uses its power. I do believe in god but sure as hell i don’t believe in narcicists that think they are god in person (aka the pope). Sorry i’m rambling this has nothing to do with what i was saying before but i got carried away.

Psychosis,fpwe9e8,t1_fputqxf,1588961917.0,"If it helps, i know that psycologyst can’t tell anyone Anything about what’s going on in your session, legally they would get in a lot of trouble. I treat my therapists as a person that only exists when i’m in session, so I know I can tell them anything without fear of being judged or feeling the need to impress them or not letting them down in any way. To me, they only exist to listen to my problems and help me find the right tools to deal with them.  

It is important to find a good therapist though, in my country we have something called “admissions” in which you go to a psychologist that knows psychologists in the area and they assign you a professional that suits your needs. If you have something similar where you live that could be a great starting point. 

And even if you somehow end up with a crappy therapist (someone that judges you or acts in a way that you don’t feel comfortable with) you can always find another one knowing full well that they won’t be able to ever say anything to anyone about what went on during your sessions."
