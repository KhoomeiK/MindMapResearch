KindVoice,fnyu7xl,t3_g4jaef,1587375846.0,"let me tell you something so many people in the world right now will trade anything they have or can give for what you have right now. And you need to understand that it's just a phase and you need to do what you know is right. Don't be so stressed about not having friends. Instead focus on your life, your happiness, whatever you love doing. I know it can be difficult but do it what you think is necessary. I noticed people only value those who value themselves so be you and I mean the best version and stop pouring all you attention on people you know it worth your time. I say it again it's ""your time"" and you only got one life

So what is going to be?"

selfimprovement,fnys3am,t3_g47lh2,1587373558.0,I feel stupid because of the things I have done in the past. But for now my only regret is the injury I caused to my rib cage. I can't forgive myself for that. And that makes me hate being human. The pain that accompanies this injury is getting worse and I can't take it. I can't hope for a miracle because I don't believe good things like that can happen to me. I don't know who to talk to and where to go. I feel so alone. I feel like I'm dying. But I act like everything is OK so no one find out the truth and judge me. Don't how much I have left but I know this can get worse. Sometimes I think death is my salvation but I can't take my life

selfimprovement,fhltuyq,t1_fhjjuv5,1581704550.0,"As long as no one tells you to your face that they hate you or give that kind of vibe then no one hates you especially if you didn't do anything wrong. You would definitely know someone who hates you and there is a big difference between someone who hates and someone who doesn't find you interesting enough to talk to you or someone who is shy and doesn't want to talk to anyone. And yes, there will always be haters but you know there are people who aren't aware of your existence even though you have crossed paths before

And yes people might want to manipulate you just to get something from you, best advice learn to recognise those kind of people and do whatever you wish with them. And there will be people who claim to be friends and when you want something from them they ignore you or leave you disappointed. Certain times they have good enough reason because you know people have priorities or maybe it was just wrong timing and they couldn't help you out at that moment.

And don't feel bad when people leave. Nothing lasts forever and when it lasts learn to appreciate it especially if that person is caring. Forgive their flaws. Focus on the good especially if the good is very significant. Sometimes people fuck up and so do we right? And know when to discard the morons

If you got anxiety issues and you're insecure, try working on that. Spend time building yourself and mastering something (hobbies). And self-love mate, practice that. I know it ain't easy and I won't tell you to make it happen immediately. It takes time and everyone knows that. Remember you're the only one who know yourself well enough and the only one who can love you the way you deserved to be love

When it comes to relationships, everything has to do with energy. The law of attraction. If you don't give good vibe you won't get em back. Stay positive and realistic

Maybe for now spend time with people of similar interests as you and talk about stuff y'all obsess with. That makes things a lot easier because there's something to talk about always. Go to cons, fucking leave your room and do whatever you feel like as long as it's safe

That's all I can say mate. I don't know if any of this makes sense to you now. Hopefully they will later on üíö"

It's a freaking big distraction and I got too many problems I need to spend time thinking about or working on them so I can't allow this app ruin my year one more time

Concerning the amount of time you spend playing video games, don't try to stop/eliminate it immediately just moderate/reduce the amount time you spend playing games. Trying to eliminate it immediately won't work trust me. I know it's not easy to change so do that when you're ready. I know it's a very difficult thing to do. Words are cheap, taking action means sweat and resistance

I can't tell you how to let go of the past. I don't know how to do that myself. I think the only way these demons will leave me is when I change my f life. And that's not soon
