HPV,f89vchk,t1_f89p0di,1574380867.0,"I told the girl I'm currently dating that I have HPV/GW and she was understanding about it. She knew it was very common and had been vaccinated as well. 

I waited about 4-5 dates before it actually came up. I don't think you should feel like you might be leading anyone on knowing you have HPV. Most people won't see it that way. I didn't see the need to bring it up until sex was on the table. You never know if a relationship is going to go anywhere right away, so I think it's your right to wait to disclose information that could end up being a moot point of it doesn't last more than a few dates anyway. 

Someone who likes you will probably stick with you."

Long story short...give people a chance, you never know..."
BPD,eu740z1,t3_ceykzo,1563517285.0,"This is usually my default unless I'm really engaged in a conversation with someone... otherwise my eyes tend to float up just past people's sightlines and I just chill...I don't like to talk for the sake of talking so sometimes I just sit back until there's something I want to say. 

I also do this when I get home after a hard day at work...I'll sit on the couch and just drift off and stare and then start day dreaming. I have to snap myself out of it or I can lose hours just being in my head"
BPD,eu73mn7,t1_eu6ihph,1563516918.0,"I do this all the time without really noticing it...a couple of days ago I did it around family while on vacation and my cousin called me out and I had to snap back in. It was weird...I didn't realize I was doing it even. 

People at work have also commented that they think I tune them out sometimes...but I just figured I wasn't too interested in the convo. It is kind of like powering down to conserve evergy"
dating,eu37bip,t1_eu35m4o,1563407211.0,"Yeah I get that...it's sometimes hard to find the balance between being excited and wanting to text and reeling it in and not showing enough interest. 

Everyone is different and has different styles. I guess you just keep meeting people until something clicks. In my experience, when you meet someone and you both are into each other, it ends up working regardless of who texts first or how much you text. If you don't click, it usually doesn't matter either...it works or it doesn't. 

That was unhelpful...sorry"
dating,eu36mh0,t3_cejc1b,1563406704.0,"Hmmm has she responded to any of your five messages you sent? If I asked someone out for drinks and they didn't answer, then sent them five more unanswered messages I would personally take that as her not wanting to contact anymore.

Sometimes no answer is an answer.
But I don't know her, and maybe this is just her style. If you really want to figure things out, I would cool it with the texts and pick up the phone and call her. If she doesn't answer, she probably screening you and you should probably just move on. If she picks up, have a casual convo and just casually apologize for all the texts by making it a joke...like ""oops, guess I got a little to excited excited about being friends lol"". Something better than that, but just play it off like it wasn't a big deal. Then make plans with her and her friends, not just the two of you. 

Also, I'm in the same situation at the moment except I haven't sent her a bunch of messages...so take all that with a grain of salt because for all I know I'm about to get ghosted and the talk of friendship maybe was just her guilt at rejecting me? Who knows..."
dating,eu357iv,t1_eu33obd,1563405681.0,"You mentioned mutual ghosting and being unsure about where you stand. Can I ask if you ever reach out first or are you waiting for them to text and break the silence?

Maybe trying reaching out more...maybe they are having the same thoughts you are and everyone is just playing a weird game of relationship chicken?"
BPD,eu340x3,t3_ce7apx,1563404837.0,"I really don't see it as faking a personality and I don't agree with BPD people having no personality.

For me I see it as having a very eclectic personality, with a broad range of interests that I can easily move between because at the end of the day I like all the different things I'm into. I'm not faking it, I just like more things than most people.

I feel like this when it comes to hanging out with people and meeting new people. I never lie about liking things they like and I'll be honest when I don't like what they like. I'm not pretending so they like me ... I just tend to focus on the shared thing we both like. 

I have friends that like different things and I'm able to go between people and groups and still find common ground. I see it as a positive thing for me. I'm highly adaptable to different situations and social groups... nothing wrong with that. The main aspects of my personality don't change even when I'm with different people though. I'm always funny, sarcastic and maybe a little too much for people, but I won't change my core self to please someone else."

BPD,eu32115,t3_ce59bd,1563403444.0,"Totally messed up I guess. I love it and definitely see it as a form of validation unfortunately. In a relationship I equate it with love. If me and my SO have sex, then I'm happy and feel loved. If she's tired or just isn't feeling it, it hurts me and I feel rejected and unloved. 

Which is crazy because people don't start and stop loving you from day to day,so to be so hurt by my partner not wanting to have sex with me is a bit over dramatic...but that's how I feel. I'm working on it."
BPD,eu310uf,t1_eu25v3l,1563402758.0,"I totally agree with this approach...I don't bring up the topic until things start to get serious. When it's casual, there's no need to overexpose yourself or over share with someone who potentially isn't going to last too long because it's just casual for now.

I don't want everyone I meet to know what I'm dealing with...I like to decide who gets to know me like that and I want to know there's something real there before."
BPD,etw615r,t1_etw55s0,1563255293.0,"Thanks for the comment! That's exactly what happened this time. I was so in my head about keeping myself in check, that I didn't show my real personality ☹️. I definitely wasn't my usual sassy self lol...oh well, I guess I just need to keep this in mind for next time. 

Sometimes it's hard to walk the line between being expressive and not crossing lines."
