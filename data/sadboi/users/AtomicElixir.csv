I'm not sure you can have a relationship with him in which he won't belittle you. Calling you names? For literally something you didn't know was going to hurt him? And then him not even taking the time to say, ""hey, sorry. I overreacted"". Then you made him food in hopes he'd apologize to you... It's pretty hard going back from behavior like that. He isn't respecting you and maybe you aren't respecting him( two sides to every story), but regardless, this relationship either needs a lot of work possibly with a therapist, or needs to end if you guys are not both willing to put in the effort to be better to eachother. 

If you decide to break up with him, start getting your ""ducks in a row"" and prepare to leave. Don't just go spouting off that you are leaving before you even have a gameplan. It sounds like he may react petty, so just be aware. Anyway, whatever you decide to do,  just remember, you were given this life with minimal time.

Have your boyfriend tag along one of these times, once you establish you still want to be this person's friend. Your boyfriend's insecurities are getting the best of him. You wanting to hang out with an old friend that you kissed one time YEARS ago is not a red flag. After five years in a relationship, there should be enough trust that this shouldn't be a big deal. 

You need to have another discussion about this. Tell him that you do want to proceed in reconnecting with this person, but you want to both agree on some boundaries so he can feel more comfortable. Reassure him of YOUR intentions. But please... Don't let this particular thing stop you from seeing your friend. It's unhealthy to have a controlling partner and you may say that he told you that you could do what you want, but it kind of seems to me that he was ultimately trying to make you feel guilty and so you wouldn't do it anyway. 

My partner and I both hang out with people we have had relations with in the past. I do get insecure about it sometimes, but that's my personal problem. I shouldn't put that on my boyfriend and that goes both ways. I hope this helps. I think most of the other comments perspectives seemed unhealthy.

Maybe you don't think you are in a position to commit to someone because you're young. That's totally fine, but just let the guy know so he can start healing from this. Heartbreaks are the worst. We get through them though! 

Just reflect, what are some of the reasons that you don't think you're ready for a relationship? Is it strictly because your scared? Does he not seem compatible with you/life goals? These types of questions are important because it could help you determine what's keeping you from wanting to be in a relationship. if it's because you think you can find someone better or reasons like that, then definitely don't get into a relationship with him.

Your gf possibly hasn't been stern enough, but it's rediculous that she has to anymore than a ""no, I'm not interested"". Clearly that's not working. 

I think this is when communication comes in to play on your part if you haven't already. Sit your gf down and tell her it makes you uncomfortable and that you don't feel this individual is respecting your guys relationship. Ask her to try and bring this guys advances to a stop by being very specific with the guy. I don't see this being healthy on your relationship when she wants to continue to be friends with him. That's fine and all, but he needs to treat her as a friend and not a potential partner. I 100% would be uncomfortable in your position. You guys don't need someone in your life who isn't supporting your relationship, as long as it's happy and healthy. When you end up talking to her, try and approach it with your frustrations with him and not her. Try not to let it get too heated either.

I do want to add that part of the reason I decided to seek help was because one of my good friends told me he believed I may have bipolar disorder. I suspected it, but it took someone else saying it for me to finally start thinking about getting help. Medication has changed the quality of my life. I still have a lot of struggles regarding my mental illness, but incomparable from the time before treatment. I'm not suggesting you come out and state you think she has bipolar disorder because of how new your relationship is, but just giving some background on my situation.

Just keep doing you girl. You've been doing what you need to do. Don't let your boyfriend discourage you. Everybody's metabolisms are different. Some people don't understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and they are completely ignorant of that fact because they lost X amount of lbs when they did Y, doesn't mean it can work for everybody. Some people can change their diet and lose some weight, no problem. There's others who diet and exercise very consistently who still struggle with losing any weight.

If you are a picky eater when it comes to vegetables, most of us can ""retrain"" our tastebuds. The key is exposure. I've been working on this lately, specifically with brussel sprouts.

I also think you may need to sit your partner down and have a discussion about this. You don't need to get too detailed with him if it's too much, but maybe just make a point that you have some unhealthy associations with calorie counting.. alongside this, it may be wise for you to seek some guidance with either a support group of even a therapist if this issue seems to continue to present itself.

I've found dating people with similar issues (and same diagnosis) is not healthy for me.

One thing I would recommend is just adjusting your diet. It has a huge impact on your mental health too. Obviously exercise is a good thing to add in, but just one day at a time. These things could help you sleep. I would also recommend you taking melatonin if you haven't been trying that already. If you are still having problems, maybe you could go see a doctor to prescribe you some sort of sleeping medication. I was on one a few years ago. I'll be honest; I didn't like it, but it helped me get back to sleeping more regularly. I refused to take them for awhile, but my psychiatrist really wanted me to just try and was very clear about how important sleep is for your mental health. It can make all of the difference.

relationship_advice,fhwvmcp,t1_fhwv6no,1581932532.0,"I hope your community has something like that available! It was a really grounding experience to be around other strong women. 

Yeah, I'm sorry too. It caused a lot of destruction, but it doesn't have the weight it used to. I'm 22. I hope you can get to this point in the future. It probably wasn't until about two years ago that I finally felt less connected to it and finally been able to have a healthy sex life. And whoever that commenter said someone is weak if they don't speak up. They don't know what they are talking about and idk what kind of advice that is. I do highly recommend you talking to your family to help set those boundaries. At least enough so they know that you have no desire to be around your brother."
relationship_advice,fhwuvy6,t3_f55vq0,1581931443.0,"I went through some of the same trauma. I remember when I used to have nightmares about telling my parents what happened and usually they would pick my brothers side in my dreams. It was awful. I couldn't take the torment anymore, the hurt I was feeling. I was so desperate to get help. So I decided to finally tell my mom. It didn't go too well for me, but I'm glad they know. I was very dismissed and I didn't have support to get the help I so desperately needed (I was 16). I avoid my brother as much as possible. I live with my parents and I'm hardly home, but my parents don't inform me when he's going to be visiting. Which sucks and hopefully your family would react better than that. 

All of that aside, I just want to say that your family will not blame you. Even if your brother tries to play innocent. It's a hard thing to tell your family something you've been anxiously hiding for all of these years, but do it. Free yourself from as much of this burden as possible. Regardless of how they react, just stand your ground on not being around him. If they react like my family did, they may try to convince you to just ""put up with it"" for the sake of them, but don't. They will eventually just have to accept this is a boundary you are setting. It's easier since you are moved out from your parents house. My family was destroyed long ago. It still pains me to be so distant, but I'm more grateful I don't have to live in silence. Look forward to going to therapy and try to make that work out for that when you can. When I moved out to Oregon and I didn't have the means to go to one on one therapy, I did find a place where sexual assault survivors could have a group talk and talk through the pain. Depending on your city, you may be able to find place similar to that. So try looking into that to help you bring more peace into your life. Going to therapy made me forgive my family and gave me a better relationship with my parents. It ultimately helped me rid of most of the nightmares.. I'm sorry you're going through this sweetheart. I know how awful it is. If you ever need an ear, just shoot me a message. I wish you the best of luck on all of your new life endeavours!"

relationship_advice,fhj6xyy,t1_fhj5coi,1581639215.0,"Yeah, for sure! You could also try and focus more on you, than on him when you talk about it. For instance, you could just say that you feel like you want to experiment with different things (positions, toys or whatever foreplay your comfortable with) because you think there is more potential for sexual pleasure than you've been having. Just be honest and say you think you can be more sexually fulfilled. You can turn it in to more of a ""hey, let's explore"" type of fun thing. It could make the situation feel less heavy to approach for you. If you do take this angle just try and determine what he will be most receptive to. Everyone is different and I want to make sure my advice doesn't make it so you are unheard and that things don't change. You deserve to get yours!"
relationship_advice,fhj4vbk,t3_f3j1qj,1581638186.0,"That sucks! If my boyfriend finishes before me, I usually just masturbate next to him if I feel like I'm already close to finishing. 

You need to have a conversation with him. I know you said you've talked to him about this before, but talk to him about it again.. try to say everything you need to say for when you do. See if he's perceptive and trys to satisfy your needs in the future. In addition to this, you should look in to some sex toys for your pleasure. Get your foreplay on and see if you can't find new things that your comfortable with and that will satisfy you. Even if he's not down for toys, get them for you so you can use on your own. I highly recommend it. I never wanted to buy any, but my friends insisted I have one and surprised me with a vibrator a short time ago lol

I've been sexually assaulted in the past, so I can kind of understand the uncomfortable part. It took me what feels like forever to be as sexually open as I am now. I hope you're able to create a healthy relationship with sex too."

I think it'd be fine if you decide later in life you want them around, but it's also okay to not want that. I wish I could have a relationship with my brother, but the abuse he put me through, I just don't think I could ever feel comfortable around him.

I don't know what to tell you. I've known for a long time not to intertwine myself with anyone financially (co-signing / anything of that nature) because I've  watched family go through some messy situations with that.

I still stand by thinking you should consider leaving your current GF. You still need time to heal and she sounds kind of like a rebound. I say rebound because your ex told you she wasn't sexually attracted to you anymore, you immediately wanted to try and get more serious with your current GF. But if you really want to stay with this girl and try to make things work, you need to do everything you can possible to not interact with your ex. She's trouble for you and other than contacting about the car/ running into eachother at gatherings, you shouldn't be talking to her. Even if you do break up with the current girlfriend, you should avoid getting back with your ex. Go live life dude. Six years is a decent amount of time and it makes sense to still have attachment to that, but you also should identify if this is just you missing her because she's comfortable to you."

I think it's just an unfortunate part of online dating. 

I haven't online dated for a few years at this point, but when I did, I met up with quite a few people and chatted with even more. The guys I met always seemed too eager and made me feel uncomfortable because some of them would start talking about serious relationship things. One guy I met, he kept asking me multiple times if I still liked him DURING the date. Another guy started talking about how good we'd look (status with money, due to our majors in college) together if we were to get married. This was also the first date. It's people like this that make online dating a turn off for me. Even though these guys were maybe pretty good guys, they made me feel like I could potentially meet someone who was unsafe in the future. I didn't want to risk it anymore, but all of that being said, it's just harder to meet women online. When you do meet up with them, make sure you aren't too eager.

If he does end up having more medical problems and he stays in his current position, well, that's on him. You leaving didn't do that to him and since you have already talked to him about leaving the position in the past, you've done everything in your power.
