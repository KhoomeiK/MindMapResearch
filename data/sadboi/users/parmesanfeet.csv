saskatoon,f87374i,t1_f85l8j1,1574314438.0,"HPV is not incurable. Your immune system is capable of clearing most strains of the virus without intervention and once the virus is cleared from your system you will not transmit and you will never have symptoms again. Research still hasn’t figured out how your immune system clears the virus, but once it is cleared you are, for all intents and purposes, cured. The sexually transmitted HPV is the save virus (different strain) that gave you warts on your fingers as a kid, or that gave you a planters wart on your foot that one time.  As an adult do you have recurring or lingering warts on your fingers? No, as your body has cleared the virus.


Note that HSV is not curable as of this moment. This virus is not cleared from your body because it lives in the nervous system and goes dormant, so your immune system doesn’t continuously fight it, and then it comes out of dormancy and causes a breakout."

weightwatchers,f5kwxtm,t3_do67t0,1572271049.0,"I am a WW life time member. Here are the answers to your questions:

1. No. WW encourages you to find foods you enjoy and does not force you to buy their products. None of the WW recipes actually use any WW products they all use regular food.

2. Yes you can pay for a few months in advance. I did a 6 month plan when I first joined.

3. The meeting provide an amazing support network and accountability. You have to go and weigh in at the meeting so you know someone else is aware of how you are following the plan. I still go to weekly meeting and love hearing other people’s triumphs because it motivates me to be better. Everyone is kind and understanding because we’ve all been exactly where you are on day 1.

I would highly recommend WW as a lifestyle change to lose weight. I have done other fad diets and they work, probably faster, but as soon as you go back to eating how you did before the diet the weight comes back. With WW it isn’t about eliminating entires groups of foods or strictly eating only certain things. WW allows you to eat whatever you want, but provides you the tools to make healthier choices day to day so overall your eating habits adapt to being healthier."
