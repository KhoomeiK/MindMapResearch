news,fmtjv7c,t1_fmszmlp,1586373970.0,"You may be right - and I'm not American so I'm just on the sidelines here - but so did Hillary depending on the polls.

It's not to say that you're wrong, but statistics like polls are very dependant on the context and details (like polling group age, or places/times of polling). 

Stats like polls can lead to points in these sorts of discussions getting dismissed prematurely, and something of value being lost.

If Biden is missing the mark somewhere, it is worth talking about - while also trying to come back to a way to improve it going forward. Not to say that we could steer how the problem is solved, but if we keep Medicare for all within the same conversation, for example, maybe that could catch on. Maybe later it could lead to his approach or position on it changing in future.

And tomorrow it's going to be 2 months and 1 day, and I'll be even more proud of you then

And I'm going to keep being more and more proud until eventually, you're so proud of yourself and happy in your own self, that you may forget this thread or this day.

But I'll still be here, proud as fuck that you got in to that hard place and fought your way back out. 

And every day since then you made the whole world a bit less dark by just being you"
