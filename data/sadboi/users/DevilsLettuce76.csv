To be honest he took care of me too,  he was bed ridden for maybe the last 6 or 7 years.  He always said I was his legs, I handled that part and he was the brains, so he made a lot of the decisions for him and I.  He is no longer here and I have been trying to make decisions for myself, and it has proven to be extremely difficult because I am bipolar.  I miss him dearly and consult with him daily to see what direction I should go in.  I basically say, what would dad do in this situation or what would dad want me to do in this situation.   I've actually been struggling a whole lot recently, all I know is my dad doesn't want me to be with him yet so I'm gonna continue to persevere.  Me and dad lived for each other, but now its just me so I can identify with your feelings.  Only wrote this because  your story resonated  with me and I thought i should share.
