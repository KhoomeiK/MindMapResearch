keyhouse,fjy3xmy,t1_fjfe960,1583689337.0,"Oof I‚Äôm a big Magicians fan and surprised that you think Locke and Key did the magical key thing better. Magicians maybe feel convoluted at times but I appreciate that they explain what is going on, strategize on how to use the keys and use them to their benefit. The characters do make dumb mistakes but they use a lot of clever strategizing and the plot is tied together pretty well despite having so many nuances.

Anyway, enough with that tangent.

It‚Äôs pretty disappointing how little was explored or explained in the show. Bode was the only one who acted out of curiosity while Kinsey was vain and impulsive, and Tyler was avoidant and trying to fight the whole key thing. So even though they make reference to learning how to use the keys as weapons, they don‚Äôt actually do that. They just fuck around, keep loose guard of the keys, and bicker with each other. 

I really wanted to like this show but I‚Äôm so annoyed at the messy plot lines, and straight up stupid decisions made by the characters. Other people mentioned it but when they all collectively agree that Ellie should go back to get the crown & bring the crown key, it‚Äôs so unbelievable that a group of people could ALL be that dumb."

queerception,fc62vlx,t1_fc61evh,1577471032.0,"Yes, I totally understand that things can get complicated and would be super down to discuss all of this with a potential co-parent. The problem is that I can‚Äôt really have those discussions until someone is actually interested in doing this with me. 

Also I should say that by independence I mean financial and personal freedoms such as the right to live in a situation that makes me happy. I am aware that my decision making will be based on my child‚Äôs needs and the other parents needs.

This has given me a lot to think about because two points you brought up do cause concern. 1. The OP wanting full custody & 2. The OP wanting less contact & distressing the child - probably bc of my own personal experience with that. So, those are two things I would definitely bring up.

A donor does seem way less complicated at this point."

I can only imagine how you feel right now, but have had my own trauma and know how invasive those kinds of memories can be. It is your choice who you talk or don't talk to about the situation. I suggest talking to people who make you feel safe and accepted. You could even call a crisis hotline if you want to hear a non-judgemental voice. I've done it many times. Having some distractions can help ease the pain too. Small things, like going on a walk, breathing some fresh air, or whatever makes you feel lighter, might help.
