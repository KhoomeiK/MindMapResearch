CHSinfo,fkt3fnv,t3_fkewj5,1584505160.0,Please remember to water down any pedialyte or gatorade you try and drink at first. Often times it’s still too heavy for stomachs undiluted.
StardewValley,fhj6kt5,t3_f3fkvj,1581639035.0,Okay this looks just like me doing real life stuff.
Bass,fef64w0,t1_fef38gh,1579049087.0,"I’ve already decided why I want to. To create music on the instrument I love. The bass I currently have is custom, and very sentimental to me. I’d much rather regain the skill I had and work with what I have than try and find another instrument. I understand the idea of working my way back up, but I don’t have the funds to go out and pick up an entirely new bass for that reason. I do appreciate the suggestion though."

CHSinfo,f7gu8k4,t3_dw5xjb,1573717878.0,"Really depends on the person, how much you smoke, and I personally believe diet plays a big part. My first episode was back in august, I quit for about two months, and have been smoking very occasionally and in small amounts. I also won’t eat immediately after. So far I’ve been fine. Don’t take this as an “okay” to pick up your previous habits. I believe I’ll always be at risk and every time I smoke I’m prepared for it to sneak up on me hard."

self,f6hgq2v,t3_dr018g,1572847632.0,"When you’re negative about or toward yourself, especially verbally, people will do the same. Practice saying out loud the things you like about yourself in the mirror. Even if you don’t completely believe yourself. Keep going until you sound confident when you say them. Stand up straight. I have a lot of insecurities but you’d never know it when you met me. False confidence goes a long way. Eventually, you’ll be able to speak up when someone says something rude to you."

Good on you for maintaining critical thinking and the ability to change your mind on subjects most people don’t dare budge. I pray for a day that moderates or middle line people can make a stand in politics"
Vent,f4vmt04,t3_dltj23,1571844782.0,"I get small zits on my butt, my back, and my chest. It’s not nearly as bad as when I was a teenager but they’re still these very red little dots on areas I’m supposed to feel confident about. They drive me crazy and I haven’t been able to afford any kind of decent treatment, just over the counter stuff that only works a little bit. My back is permanently scarred from all the acne and they look like a horrible rash. It’s the root of a lot of insecurities. As far as your butt zit goes, do you best to wear loose underwear and pants until it heals so your skin can breathe"
Vent,f4pnkmc,t1_f4pdk59,1571738524.0,Thank you. I think once I get more financial freedom I might be able to start planning for the life I want. I’m just such an instant gratification person it can’t happen soon enough.

Brag about it, even. Invite people who are confused to discuss the voting booklets that come in the mail, or wherever you get info. Make it counter culture to vote. Make it about resistance, since that seems to speak to people more y'know? Make voting punk rock"

CHSinfo,ezvvck0,t3_d150jj,1568198811.0,"I honestly went to the ER under the idea I had really bad food poisoning. While I hadn't smoked in a few days, the symptoms hit maybe 20 minutes after I had eaten Pad Thai (and not the best at that). I'm no stranger to CVS and the vomiting didn't start until about 2 hours into the stomach pain which was the only real difference. The CHS was more aggressive than the CVS I had suffered for a year after a birth control mishap."
SWORDS,eyphvjf,t1_ey1beif,1567300553.0,I'm a part of a community of post apocalyptic larpers (I use the word loosely as we're truly just playing dress up in a giant sandbox and getting REALLY wasted and partying for a week) called Wasteland Weekend and it was gifted to me! The guy said it's just been laying about his house and he might have gotten it at as a gift years prior. It truly is a mystery of where it came from exactly!

self,esd4vav,t1_escwhkl,1561847173.0,"I'm sorry if I came off condescending in any way, that's not my intention at all. Would she be willing to create more of a dialogue with you while she's away, maybe video chats or something? I'm sure she's busy but there's some matter of making it work through effort on her part. I know personally I feel much better when I know that I'm still my sig other's priority while they're away. But maybe that's possessiveness and I know that can push people away. 
I truly understand the voice. And how cruel it can be. 
I hope there's a path for the two of you to make this work. It does seem like you're fighting in your own way to make that happen."
self,esc429l,t3_c6yx5u,1561820459.0,"You definitely need to tell her how you feel in a way that doesn't seem like you're attacking her for her hobbies. She is allowed to have relationships and things outside of your relationship, but if you need reassurance, let her know. It sounds like you might not trust her out of insecurities and the only reason I say that is because I'm going through the same things. She might be willing to take extra steps to make you feel a bit more comfortable. 

On the flip side, if you two don't have a solid relationship to begin with, and you're struggling to let her do things she enjoys, maybe it's time to split ways? Or bring it up in conversation? 

Shed ego and allow yourself to be vulnerable to her about it. If that's not a thing you can do, maybe seek a relationship councelor. Godspeed."
