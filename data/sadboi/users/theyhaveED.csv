Writing in such a meaning dense way is both enjoyable, and also helps create the kind of work I enjoy reading. Lastly, once I perform a work or send it to someone as a final, I save it as its own file and don’t allow myself to edit it anymore, saves me from constantly tweaking my work for months. 

As for the quality of my work, people seem to enjoy it but I know that doesn’t always equate to good. I know that my perspective on myself is inherently biased and thus I can’t tell you how good my own work is accurately. If you want I wouldn’t mind reading a few pieces..."
