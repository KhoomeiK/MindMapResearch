Anxiety,fovxahv,t1_fovx0jx,1588109145.0,"I wish you all the best. I’ve just started on SSRIs but I take propanolol along with them and it does wonders for my physical symptoms. Although my physical symptoms aren’t the main concern in regards to my anxiety they definitely are a huge part of my life, so I can imagine the relief you feel with the propanolol working"
Anxiety,fovwhue,t1_fovw74k,1588108741.0,I love England! Many family members stay there. Very fond memories of travelling through the country :)
Anxiety,fovwbpl,t3_g9ut7e,1588108655.0,"My anxiety manifests physically in shaking and breathlessness. Health anxiety has always been a huge issue for me and living through a pandemic really doesn’t help with my catastrophising. The beta blockers definitely helped with the shaking, breathlessness not so much however it is different for everyone. I also get very dizzy when my anxiety is peaking.

The main side effect I’ve had is drowsiness. I started taking them while still working and studying full time and I found it really difficult, however adjusted to taking them on a time schedule so my body adjusted eventually. 

They didn’t really help much for intrusive thoughts to be honest, just helped me physically calm down and lessened the chance of having a panic attack. If your main issue is physical symptoms definitely beta blockers alone, however if you are also experiencing intrusive thoughts I would consider an SSRI but consult a GP to figure out what’s best for you"
Anxiety,fovvrsx,t1_fovukvx,1588108379.0,"To add onto this, UK people, I phoned 111 having a panic attack and they gave me a resource which provides online therapy, NHS covered, completely free. I believe it is called living life, not sure if it’s only available in Scotland (where i am) but worth a shot. I’ve not used it yet but plan on"
Anxiety,fovutu7,t1_foso7l6,1588107907.0,Currently 2 weeks on it now and still not over the side effects. My anxiety is still pretty bad and I feel erratic but I definitely feel a difference. I think the worst thing for me is nausea
Anxiety,fnkoxfk,t1_fneowrk,1587035327.0,I’ve not tried therapy but physical exercise works to an extent but more as a distraction than a solution. In the UK therapy’s quite difficult to come across because it’s through the NHS unless we go private which I can’t afford. I’m hoping the SSRIs will help to an extent. I’ve not felt much yet apart from nausea and an irregular heartbeat
Anxiety,fnejolf,t1_fndwkg2,1586890574.0,Thank you so much! I’m a little scared but maybe it’s a good think it’s a slow building thing and will be able to help me over a longer stretch of time. My anxiety is starting to ruin my life so I really need to do something about it lol. I’ve been avoiding anti depressants for so long
Anxiety,fneji89,t1_fne40kt,1586890487.0,"I’m not sure I’m starting the Zoloft tomorrow, but I’ll let you know if it does help. My anxiety is mainly impulsivity, catastrophising & health anxiety so it’s apparently good for helping you think a little more rationally. Maybe give your GP a phone and see what’s best? I’m not sure where you’re located, I’m in UK, but I’m sure regardless where you are you’ll have some other options.

It really does suck. I am really hoping this will be a turning point for myself. I’m 19 and I’m going back to my student flat in September so it’s basically surviving the summer ahhaha."
Anxiety,fndwcs7,t1_fndw14s,1586878713.0,"It’s weird. My parents are very loving and kind people but they don’t understand the full extent of what I’m going through. Last time I tried to address it, it didn’t go down too well so I’m just doing it this way because it’s easier. 

Propanolol made me a lot worse too but my GP is advising I up the dosage with an SSRI to see if that helps at all. I’m kind of glad I’m starting sertraline in lockdown because no one is really gonna see me much. 

I’m sorry your parents speak to you like that :(. You’re doing what’s best for your health - don’t worry about their comments"

I volunteer at a disabled charity working with horses and I had to get a certificate and qualification to even be allowed near the disabled people to help them. (The first few weeks of me working there were directly working with the horses until I was qualified to work with disabled and special needs). This is completely unacceptable on your stores behalf and like I said you should 100% take this further - not just for you but for any disabled people coming in in the future to avoid this situation. It was completely not your fault though.
