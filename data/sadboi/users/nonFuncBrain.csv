Or you'll get a systemic response where you feel bummed out, sleep bad and feel generally bad (proper overtraining), but that would probably relate to your whole body not recovering enough and presumably happens after training way too much for quite some time.

Example:
If I do 4 sets of chins everyday to failure I'll actually do fewer and fewer reps on each consecutive day since I don't recover enough. Maybe my first set on my first day will be 15 and then 12 on the next day and then 10 on day three. I'll probably be able to do 10 for many days in a row. Eventually I'll get stronger. But I'll most likely grow faster and get stronger if I do 4 sets to failure every third day. Then I'll be able to do 15 on the first set each day and soon add a rep."

Personally I enjoyed the first alternative better.

Greed is the way of nature and *no* organism stands above it, let alone ""all mammals"". You should read ""the selfish gene"" by Dawkins. . 

When it comes to human dominance it primarily stems from our social organisation and only secondarily from tool use. The most distinguishable trait of humans is *language* which in turn provides the function of culture, ie the development of technology. Language is a social endeavour used for cooperative behavior. No asocial animal would ever develop such a way to communicate. Using language the issues met and solved in one generation can directly be taught to the next so they won't have to go through the same ordeal. Moreover, language leads to a greater possibility to utilize the margin of benefits of altruism, as negotiations, promises and deals can be explicitly stated.

Coincidently, the selfish gene will further discuss the economical benefits of altruism. I don't know how to interpret your point about octopuses. Yes, there are other species that are also altruistic and even more altruistic than man, and there are other factors in the evolution of man that were critical for our dominance.

What do we stockpile that is not related to procreation and survival? The search for high status, monetary wealth and, I guess, a stockpile of something, has evolved as a strategy to ensure survival and procreation. Nothing else. We aren't more greedy than any other organism."

I know that there are butyrate producing bacteria in the colon which feed our colanocytes, which may lead to their longer survival, slower turnover and therefore lessen the risk of coloncancer. They can also feed on ketones or glucose but their preferred fuel is butyrate, often touted to be the reason we should eat fiber. 
But these stories, even when underpinned by good studies, can't catch everything that happens in the gut. Plenty of people eat no fiber and still don't get colon cancer and may have other benefits from the lack of fiber. Or not. We just don't know."

BipolarReddit,fqosfus,t1_fqduk83,1589523493.0,"Yeah, it's the same for me, drugs gave me tinnitus, hepatitis, zombification and all that. I ended up on lamictal, latuda and lithium since they didn't give me much issues but I never felt any positive effects either. Of course, a psychiatrist only has drugs to offer and is convinced that its the only way forward. And so was I. As a scientist working on the brain I always revelled in the details of pharmacology and studies of the brain from all sorts of perspective. I was completely convinced that the problem for a bipolar person is an issue with phase locking certain regulatory centers in our hypothalamus that regulates energy levels, libido, satiety, sleep etc, and I never thought the issue could be systemic, metabolic and non specific. I dismissed the whole growing literature saying that there's something metabolically very different on bipolar brains. I could understand that psychiatrists would do the same, it's just in the culture, the perspective that they've been taught to think about. 
In some sense, psychiatry and nutrition science are in the same boat. The science is really bad and is very biased by economic incentives and dogma. The way antidepressants and antipsychotics are allowed into the market is a joke. A drug is approved of it is better than placebo in two clinical trials, but there's no regulation of how many trials the drug company can make. Thus, there are drugs that failed to show any efficiency in five trials in a row, who then managed to be better than placebo in two trials and are now sold as effective psychiatric medication and touted as the only way to get better. 
On the same time we know that many patients *are* saved by drugs and swear by them as the only thing that keeps them alive. Obviously they are important, it's just that we need to be vigilant and sceptical because of all the individual variations in our illnesses. And we have to understand that many drug side effects can be extremely debilitating and dangerous and hard to quit, which is something that almost no psychiatrists ever discussed with me. Many drugs exacerbate metabolic issues that, if the underlying condition is metabolic in nature to begin with, will lock the patient in an unwinnable battle. This might be the reason psychiatric conditions are ""chronic"" in the developed world. 

Yes, carnivore is super exciting. This I also dismissed at first since it sounds like some extreme reaction to veganism. But if you look at r/carnivore, these people are very well informed, they take the science seriously and the improvements they see are astounding. I've tried it and I might see a slight improvement in my mood, but keto is enough to keep me from getting into episodes so I'm probably gonna continue having some veggies now and then. But if keto doesn't work for a patient aiming to improve her mental health, carnivore is definitely something to try. It's not a fundamentalist fad diet, it's a serious science based elimination diet to come to terms with mainly autoimmune disorders.
 
Medicine is just so far behind in understanding how the immune system, metabolism, gut microbiota and the brain work together that patients must take the responsibility of their own care, and explore, test and study their own conditions. Sad thing is that this is impossible for many mental patients, for obvious reasons. I got my diagnosis late in life, I had a perfect childhood, a great marriage, a wonderful career and a great education, specifically aimed at understanding the brain. Still took me five years of misery after realizing what was wrong until I found an effective way to combat it. 


Whoa, look at me ranting. Sorry about that. I don't want to sound anti psychiatry, I'm just frustrated with the field. I don't think psychotropic drugs should be banned but I think one should try the safer, simpler and cheaper options of lifestyle changes first, and I believe that for many, keto could help a lot."

ketoscience,fqdjpz4,t3_gi7u6b,1589291127.0,"I'm using the ketogenic diet for therapeutic purposes and have pondered the same question. I imagine that ketosis must have been common at some point during our evolution to make some of us so dependent on it.
I've got bipolar disorder, a genetically predisposed dysregulation of moods. Recently it's become clear that bipolar brains are gasping for energy and have a disturbed metabolism: our neural mitochondria are tiny and dysfunctional and our brains are getting full of lactate because our normal glycolysis, the metabolism of sugars, is not working as it should.
Ketones bypass the glycolytic metabolism and reestablish the function of, and increase the number of mitochondria. Thus, the diet make me completely normal and stable.

Another evidence of our ketotic past stems from our body fat levels. Compared to our closest living relatives even the thinnest human is morbidly obese. Male bonobos have a body fat of less than 1%! Bonobos never run out of food. When their preferred food is in short supply they just turn to something else, there's always food in their vicinity. Keeping a lot of body fat is unnecessary and would just bog their body down when moving around. 

Our ancestors must at some point had a life where there were periods of plenty and periods of shortages for evolution to pressure us to store so massive amounts of fat. Seasonal differences in food availability or types of consumed foods would be a reason that ""bad"" genes, such as my bipolar ones, were kept in the population. Ie, they may not have led to bipolar disorder in populations where ketosis occurred regularly.

A lot of the above is speculation of course, but it makes sense to me."

neuro,fqcw5k1,t3_gi3qwp,1589270979.0,"No, I don't think so, but they may highlight the problem. Imagine that we knew exactly how the brain works, how it represents qualia, how thoughts flow, the whole thing. It would permit us to simulate a brain and with that a conscious person. Would that make you understand what it means to *be* a brain? 

I think the existential issues people have with consciousness stems from the subjective/objective divide. Our brain has a way of modeling the external world and we call that ""understanding"". We can understand a causal mechanism from its interacting constituents. We can definitely understand how a brain works, which algorithms are employed to learn, extract features, make decisions etc. But understanding a system, modelling it, is not the same thing as *being* that system. 

But I'm happy with that. I feel the existential issues I had with consciousness are mostly gone after I've done neuroscience for many years. I'm a system that explains itself and the world around it and this (my introspective experience) is what it means to be that system. I hardly believe other people to be fine with it though but with better and more definit understanding of how the brain works my guess is that the question will become more moot and less magical."
BipolarReddit,fqcm3ah,t1_fqc6ee9,1589261905.0,"Yup. Modern psychiatric disorders are being increasingly understood to stem from metabolic issues. It's remarkable how evidence is popping up from so many different sources and conditions that all point in the same direction. Autism, alzheimers, psychotic and affective disorders alike. It all comes down to a few factors, which are probably directly related: inflammation/autoimmunity, and the gut microbiome. I imagine a future of psychiatry where psychiatric drugs are relegated to a last resort treatment and patients are instead receiving fecal transplants and diet adjustments. 

There's a ""conspiracy"" of sorts in nutrition. The classical ""cholesterol = cvd"" explanation is so simple to understand and sounds so plausible that it has gotten firmly locked into culture in laypersons and professional practitioners alike. But if you look at people who actually do research on it and are well read on the latest literature they tell you that cholesterol is a red herring. Risk factors are things that correlate with a problem, meaning that they *might* be causal. Sadly, doctors tend to look at them as ""mini causes"" and act as if they do exert an effect even when they are just passive players. 
The real problem of chronic modern disease leading to cvd, the metabolic syndrome, stems from insulin resistance. Cholesterol is something that is damaged (oxidized) by a diet high in calories and carbs in concert with a low grade inflammation, typically initiated by a high glycemic load and possibly polyunsaturated fats (seed oils). Saturated fat is *not* the culprit, neither is cholesterol. 
When you do a ketogenic diet you reverse almost all of the risk factors found in the metabolic syndrome, you lower your triglycerides and you stabilize your blood sugar and metabolic hormones. But one of the strongest effects is on your inflammation, which will plummet (and if it doesn't you should pin point why not and really solve this issue). Cholesterol in this state is a benign and integral player of your healthy lipid metabolism, transporting lipids to and from your liver. 

I of course know nothing about the specifics of your bipolar disorder, but for me, getting out of this illness is worth anything. I would literally die soon if I would continue to have it. If I was worried about cvd I would do regular CAC scans, which clearly show any calcium buildup in your heart, and do thorough cholesterol panels to see the ratios and particle numbers of the cholesterol that actually counts. But I'm convinced that your cholesterol metabolism will be much more healthy on a ketogenic diet and that you will lower your cvd risk, compared to if you're on a standard diet. 

Here's a good recap of the modern stance of cholesterol, the metabolic syndrome (aka insulin resistance) and heart disease.

The field has moved far away from thinking that cholesterol is a dangerous food that'll kill you. Even ""good"" and ""bad"" cholesterol (HDL and LDL) is too much of a simplification. One needs to look at their ratio, and if one is particularly worried or in a risk group, also test for oxidized LDL, which is the dangerous particle that may lead to heat disease.

After one day back on ketogenic diet it disappeared. Who knows for how long it will work but I'm very hopeful. 

I thus don't have a psychiatric disorder, I have some kind of metabolic disorder.

I'll stay on this diet for the rest of my life if i have to, since it's the only thing keeping me alive. But I'd rather use a more targeted approach if there is one."

1. ""may"" is a good choice of words and is common in scientific discourse and dauty did'nt abuse it since
2. Cholesterol is to some extent under negative feedback regulation and this has been known for a long time and is not controversial. 

What source are you asking for? Here is a review of the molecular pathways of cholesterol homeostasis. 
https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.genet.41.110306.130315
It contains sources going back to the 30s and may teach you the history of how we know that cholesterol synthesis is regulated by food intake, if that is what you want. Otherwise I would refer you to a textbook in nutrition.

Common courtesy? Really? You CABBAGE? You definitely need to be tone-policed and learn some humility. 

>Those are two entirely different uses of the word ""may"". 

Oh, so you are the authority of the semantics of other peoples choices of words? Explain deeper how you came to the conclusion of the meaning of dauty's use of ""may"", and don't forget to back it up with sources. 

My source shows that there *is* negative feedback and I put it there to prove the point that the concept is old and well established. It is not there as the ultimate study of cholesterol homeostasis nor is it there to argue about magnitude or circumstances. Although I consider it bad taste I can cherry pick a sentence, just like you did, to ""prove"" my point:
""The feeding of cholesterol produces complete inhibition of hepatic synthesis in the normal animal""
However, if you want to dispute the role of negative feedback in cholesterol synthesis, be my guest."

It's a humble way to express your scientific opinions, which is good practice in controversial areas such as these. A real scientist ""know"" that you never know anything and that everything is subject to change, ergo ""may"" is commonly used to refrain from proposing hypotheses as facts. 

Moreover, the claim is not very controversial but has been in the literature since the 70s.

It doesn't go against the second law of thermodynamics, the energy from proteins are not stored as effectively but gets utilized in other pathways. There are many ways to theoretically speculate about how and why it works like this but the clinical proof is overwhelming. Telling people to not listen to anybody else than you is not a great argument."

However, upon rereading these papers I realize that they were maybe not as strong as I remembered and might not be the final word in the mechanisms of ketamine. The critical metabolite HNK is not active at the NMDA receptor, where ketamin is thought to exert its psychotomimetic effect. However, HNK *is* neuronally active as it stimulates AMPA receptor activity. Terribly interesting though."
