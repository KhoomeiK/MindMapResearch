askblackpeople,fn89cwn,t1_fn84qwp,1586736672.0,"I understand completely. I know that I definitely question myself a lot. Like, would I be saying the same thing I'd somebody was white? Or am I just thinking that this person is just an ""angry black person"" because I have internal biases? So I get where you're coming from 100%. But if somebody is being prejudiced against somebody for being different, always call them out. Of course, we have to be careful with our language when we call them out because sometimes for white or white passing people like us, we have been socialized to respond to POC's differently; like we might be more understanding and gentler with a whitey than we would be to a POC. But you seem like youd be pretty careful with that sort of thing anyway. 
Black people can certainly be extremely prejudiced against other POC's. Some people (including myself) wouldnt use the term ""racist"" because the definition requires that black people are able to systematically oppress the other race; and in our society, that's not possible. But in the layman's usage of racism (disliking or being prejudiced against another person for their culture, ethnicity, or skin color) then yes, absolutely. My friends in college, who were black girls, would say racial slurs and would bully Mexican girls. When they found out I was Hispanic, they called me racial slurs and excluded me from things because I was ""one of those sp*cs."" Is it a response and a reaction to the racism that they also experience at the hands of white people? Perhaps. Is it still prejudice? I believe so. However, I AM a pale skinned white/hispanic, so I can only speak from what I know and from personal experience. I hope that it helped."

What is he so scared of you hearing? Him being silly to his kids? That seems a little far-fetched to me. I don't know him at all, but I can't imagine that that's the only reason. I think you really need to bring this up to him. And definitely don't make the focus that he talks to his children to much; that kind of attitude towards the situation kind of makes you look bad, even if that's not exactly what you mean. 
My fathers ex wife would get insanely jealous of me and didnt want my father to spend time with me or talk to me, because I was a reminder of my mom. She had a great relationship with her own kids from a previous marriage, they even lived with them, but wouldn't let my dad even talk to me.
