Enough to bleed, enough to hurt and get my brain to produce those magic-happy-chemicals to get the fix I needed to get through another few days.

If you're not showing them off to people, you're not attention seeking.  If you're not shouting about it like ""I'm so miserable I'm going to go home and cut myself!"", you're not attention seeking.  If you're not doing it in front of people to get a rise out of them, or to get people flocking to you to make sure you're ok, you're not attention seeking.  The very definition of attention seeking behaviour is that you *actively* make it obvious to get sympathy or to get people to notice you.  If you're keeping them hidden, and you feel ashamed of them, even if they're only shallow, you're not attention seeking.  And even people who *do* do it for attention are probably in need of some kind of psychiatric help or counselling, because injuring yourself just for the attention of those around you isd not healthy behaviour.  But personally, from the short amount you've said about it, that doesn't sound like you

I can't tell you how to stop it... I've not managed it yet...

Yeah, quite frequently.  Just because they're your friends, doesn't mean that you have to enjoy every second you spend with them... lots of things can mean that a night out goes a bit sour.  A day spent with your friends could be great, or it could be bloody awful... it depends on your frame of mind, their frame of mind, what you're doing, loads of things.  Sometimes you can go out with a group of friends, and for no reason whatsoever, they just annoy the crap out of you, or you annoy the crap out of them or something... They're friends, but even friends disagree, fight, annoy each other or just get bored with each other sometimes.  It doesn't mean you're not proper friends or that you shouldn't spend time with them... it's just one of those things that happens sometimes.

Believe me lovely, self harming won't make you feel better about the crap night/day you've had with your friends, and killing yourself isn't the answer either.  Is there anyone around that you can talk to?  Family? Another friend?  It might help to speak to someone about how you feel?  If not, please try not to hurt yourself... I know how hard it is not to so it when you have that urge, but try to distract yourself... watch some TV to block out the thoughts, get yourself some food or something.

I would give him some time to come to terms with what you tried to do.  keep in contact, but don't push him.

Sometimes I don't understand *why* I feel the way I do ir why I do the things I do to cope, but that doesn't mean the feelings are wrong in themselves.  Maybe a coping strategy (depressive behaviour, self harming etc) might not be the best solution to how you feel, but if that's the only way you know how to cope, that doesn't necessarily make *that* wrong either, not that I'm advocating self harm or anything like that.

The trick is trying to understand the reasons for how you feel, and understand the behaviours associated with it.  Sometimes it's not even a reason you can understand, it's just a chemical short circuit in your brain.  But it can be a long road working out why you feel a certain way and why you do what you do to cope with those feelings, it can take a lot of hard work to retrain yourself to find different coping mechanisms, or to find a drug that helps to redress the chemical balance in some cases.

Wrong?  No.  Confusing and hard to understand, yes.  Fixable?  Depends on your definition... you might not be able to completely erase those feelings, but you might, with time and patience be able to understand them and cope better with them.AAnd it is always worth trying. xx"

selfharm,erwcies,t3_c4fip0,1561339580.0,"Hey.  take a deep breath.

It sounds like you're taking responsibility for your friends actions.  I'm assuming you did it first and she started doing it later?

You're not to blame for it... self harm is... something that happens to people sometimes... it's not anyones fault.  When I first started I knew a lot of my friends did it, but it wasn't like I said to myself ""Oh, xxxx cut themselves, that sounds like a good idea, I'll try that.""  That's not how it works, or wasn't for me anyway, and not for a lot of my friends either.  Self harm is an endemic problem, a psychological problem.  Even if you'd never self harmed in your life, there's a good chance she would still do it, it's not like it's a particularly secret or niche activity, it's all over the media about how young people are self harming more than ever etc etc.

So please stop beating yourself up, it's not your fault.

Is there any way that you and your friend could make an agreement?  If you feel the need to do it, call each other up and talk until the urge passes?  I dunno, I found talking to someone to distract myself helped me stop, but everyone's different.

I'm not going to tell you not to do it, because I know from experience that, if you feel that way, so full of pain and anger that you can't think straight, it is very difficult *not* to do it.  But I will ask you one favour... be careful and be as safe as you can... That's not me giving you permission, or advocating it, it's me being concerned for your wellbeing and wanting you to be ok.  Think about what I said, and if you haven't already, think about speaking to someone to get some help... it's not an easy road, but it is possible to stop.

I know it's not easy to beat the desire to end it all, to keep fighting through the loneliness and isolation and pain, but you can do it.

SuicideWatch,ervtsmw,t3_c4bpby,1561324856.0,"Ohhhhh... I know *that* feeling and it's not a healthy place to be... but you know that.

Self harming is like an addiction... for a brief moment when you do it, it makes you feel good... that's your brain releasing those lovely happy-chemicals to ease the pain you just caused yourself... but it never lasts long enough does it?  So you do it again... and again... and again, until you're covered in cuts and scars and half-healed scabs.  And like any addiction, it's very hard to stop... but it *is* possible.  I would definitely start off small, by cleaning those cuts and making sure they don't get infected.  Then try and work out *why* you do it... with me it was a couple of reasons... sometimes I got so angry with myself and people around me that I needed a release, so I cut.  Other times I felt close to suicide, but I couldn't do that to my family and people that loved me, so I cut instead (not to kill just to hurt).  But mostly it was when I felt numb, dissociated and alone, and I cut because it was the only thing I could feel.

And then I felt shitty about myself because I was covered in cuts and scars, and I'd been *weak* and done it again.  It wasn't necessarily weakness tho... most addicts relapse from time to time, and the relapses got less and less frequent as time passed... it's probably been a couple of years or more since it happened last.

You can stop, it might take time, and it will definitely take effort, but you can do it.  Ask for help, friends, family, a therapist... see if there's someone who will be willing to talk with you... someone you can call if you feel the need to do it...

Is what I *wanted* to say to them... what I generally did was smile and nod and seethe internally at the sheer audacity that I didn't know my own mind... that sometime in the future my hormones would send me on a baby making rampage, because I'm a woman, and that's what women are *for.*  

I dislike people.  Not specific people, but people in general.  Because ""people"" are usually full of shit.  They are vicious, and nasty, and ignorant, and bigoted, and violent, and yes the sheer amount of hatred in this world is horrifying and exhausting.

But there's also love, and beauty, and kindness, and you have to hold onto that whenever you find it, because despite all the ugliness, the world is still a beautiful place with beautiful people in it (and I don't mean pretty people, I mean beautiful souls).   There's always gonna be assholes and bigots, but at the end of the day, *most* of us are just people trying to live our lives as  best we can, and if we can make the world a tiny bit better in the process that's great.  If not, at least we can try not to make it worse.

I do feel this tho.  My life experience is different, but I see the ugly in the world, I just try my hardest to look past it to what's hidden.  It is not easy :)"

People have pretty much said most of what needs to be said about it, but here's my take anyway :)

I always felt that Star Trek was a little to... *heroic?* Star fleet/The Enterprise/The federation swoop in and save the day *tends* to be the culmination of most episodes, the fun is finding out how they get there...

Babylon 5 I felt was darker, there was always a sense of being on the edge of utter annihilation (similar to DS9 in the overarching narrative) but even in the standalone episodes there's no guarantee that things will turn out the way you expect them to if you've been a serial Star Trek watcher.

Storylines and character interplay and development were phenomenal, and yes, some of the acting is a little flat at times, and the effects are dated, but if you stick with it, if you're anything like me, you'll find yourself utterly hooked and truly invested in the individual characters and the planetary politics.

It is well worth a watch.  Plus you get the (dubious?) bonus of several cameo appearances by Walter Koenig.

In my opinion it's a series that could be remade and do really well... it worked for Battlestar Galactica, and even Lost in Space got a bloody remake FFS, so why not Babylon 5?"

She's also a mother hen type tho which might help, always looking after people and righting wrongs.

I've never found it easy to make friends, not since I was about 6 anyway, general low-grade bullying right through school made me kinda introverted and paranoid about people... so I satellite... I dip in and out of the orbits of people I like for a while and then move on for a bit... moving away from the area where I grew up and worked for most of my life didn't really help, I've lost touch with a lot of people I knew, and not made many friends (two - and only because hubby will talk to literally anyone). 

I'm the person at parties that sits in the corner and listens to what people are saying without contributing to the conversation, or just doesn't turn up at all and no-one really notices.

But as well as being introverted, as I get older, I'm losing my tolerance for other people's bullshit, manufactured drama and such, which means that, rather than socialising I'd rather be on my own talking to strangers on the internet.

I keep dropping hints about a masterwork halberd but the HubbyGM said no  lol  I imagine in the later chapters when we're fighting bigger, badder enemies, it's probably going to be a little less OP :)"
Pathfinder_RPG,er58xiy,t1_er52wvk,1560520771.0,"I play a Tiefling Paladin in our War For The Crown campaign...  she's lethal with a halberd, and obliterates undead like a pro (seriously, she single-handedly annihilated a Walcofind (sp?) with one blow due to a lucky crit roll), but won't stand for other party members needlessly killing, or torturing prisoners for information. And she's been known to trip adversaries with her tail on occasion so they're easier to incapacitate.  So yeah, you can have fun with a Paladin :D  


I think the GM (my hubby) is a little annoyed by the halberd, cos it does make her a little OP sometimes, but Oh Damn is it fun pulverising undead creatures with it!"
2meirl4meirl,er4qkpi,t1_er3r4e5,1560505094.0,"If you find you can't eat, have you tried Huel?   It's a meal replacement drink, supposedly completely balanced with vitamins, minerals, slow release carbs, fibre etc, everything you need... comes in either poder form which you mix with water, or now they do a pre mixed form in ready to drink bottles.  Powder comes in various flavours, ready to drink stoff comes in berry or vanilla flavours.

&#x200B;

It's obviously not ideal, but it might be a good place to start to get the vitamins/minerals and nutrition you need to function properly, and I find it's quite filling so it might help your hunger pains too....  Over in the UK I have to order it online, not sure if it's the same in the US (or where you are in the world?) but it might be worth looking into?

&#x200B;

Bear in mind, I'm just a person, not a medical professional or anything like that, so do not hold me responsible for any advice I'm giving here, it was just an idea!

&#x200B;

There's also Soylent, which is similar to Huel, but I don't think soylent is as nutritionally balanced, and the ready to drink Soylent is a bit watery compared to the Huel so is much less filling.

Hope you manage to sort something out to get you on track x"

 But, in addition to that, do you really think the actual on-the-ground devs had much say in what was included in the game, what game mechanics were actually implemented?  Devs do the leg-work for what the higher ups want... usually doing long hours for relatively low pay to hit ridiculous deadlines to  make something that resembles what a designer has requested.... but the finished product isn't dictated by the devs-on-the-ground... they do their best to do the work they've been given with the time and resources available to them.  


If you want to blame anyone, blame Gamefreak management.

&#x200B;

There's a good chance with everything kicking off, that the devs will be under fire from their bosses anyway, for trying to do the job they were told to do in the first place, because devs are worth nothing in the games industry, and the managers and directors of games companies never take any responsibility for any criticism, but accept praise like it's mana from heaven."
