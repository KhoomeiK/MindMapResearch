Since you're here I actually have another question specifically for you- were you only able to do part of the Trilogy tour? I saw Mitch from SP was playing on some of the dates and I also thought I saw you mention a few months ago that you'd be missing part of tour. Anyway, I'm REALLY happy you made the Denver date and were able to melt my face. Much love!"
Metalcore,fken5yg,t3_fi23xq,1584116634.0,"Hi guys, I would just like to start off by congratulating you on the album of the year, maybe decade, maybe of ever? I don’t know, this is absolutely insane. I'm actually typing out my question about 5 hours before the AMA because I'm excited. I got my preorder on Wednesday and I fell in love immediately. My expectations were quite high already because Everchanger has been my favorite album of all time since it came out and also because the singles were F I R E my guys. Anyway, somehow my unreasonably high expectations were EXCEEDED and then some. I am a writer and I was actually left speechless for a period of time,and this is basically just a rant because you have damaged my brain. This album is fucking beautiful. Anyway, I suppose I should ask a question. When did the process of writing this album REALLY start? I never stopped following y’all for a minute but I’d love to know more about how Marcus got involved in the project and how it all started.

I’m already planning a Greyview tattoo, I can’t tell you how much it (the album) means to me already. Lyrically, musically, vocally- this album is fucking brilliant. You all did not miss a SINGLE beat on the hiatus/vocalist change.

I’d also like to say that you guys absolutely SMASHED live in Denver on the 26th of last month. It was my first time seeing you in well over two years and it was worth every minute of the wait. I was the chick with blue hair rambling at your merch table about this subreddit and how excited I was for this album lol. I hope that this album really takes off and I can see you play some longer setlists. You really deserve it. Congratulations and THANK YOU for creating this masterpiece. I cried on my first listen. And some other listens. Fuck.

Edit: Spelling. Too hype."
Metalcore,fkdye8i,t1_fkc7f4j,1584099883.0,"I love this comment so much. I got emotional just reading it because I 1000% agree. Since my very first listen I’ve been just mind blown. I’ve barely slept. It’s all I want to talk about, I just want to tell everyone that they need to give it a listen. 
I was the same way when Ben left and waiting for them to come back. This was so worth any wait. Frick."
Metalcore,fkdxs6x,t1_fkcdm42,1584099282.0,I’m not sure what a “bless up” award really is but it seemed fitting so it’s yours. Agree with this comment. Really hoping this album gets the recognition that it deserves. It’s a masterpiece.
Metalcore,fkc8tnb,t3_fhm9h7,1584048073.0,"I got my first (I ordered two since vinyl won't ship until late spring) pre-order in the mail yesterday and holy shit, I am in love. This album is a masterpiece in the truest sense of the word. Invent has been one of my favorite bands for years and I can confidently say that they really came out of this hiatus/vocalist change strong AF. Likely going to end up AOTY for me.

Oh, and if Trilogy tour is coming to you (and doesn't get cancelled) PLEASE GO! Saw them on the 26th of last month for the first time since 2017 and it was worth every minute of the wait. Not to mention, the entire bill for that tour is sick and they all killed it!!

Edit: This album is so good that I feel like I need to do something about it.

Edit 2: what the frick? This gets better with every listen. This may be more than just an AOTY for me."
