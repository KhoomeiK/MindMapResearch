Maybe if you said because it's ruled by Saturn and Uranus I'd agree but thats not your reasoning. (I agree though that being a fixed sign helps)"
astrology,fr37dc2,t1_fr36w4k,1589851430.0,I think you completely missed my point. What Im saying is that I don't believe in the theory that the order of the signs represent different ages in any way.

BipolarReddit,fo2au1o,t3_g4z34s,1587455462.0,"So I'm a person who is into spirituality and offbeat spiritual knowledge. And in one of the theories I've read, it says that we live in cycles of incarnations. Every time we die we choose to reincarnate in certain situations, surrounded by certain people, and going through certain experiences, in a certain body/person. And we choose these scenarios because we're meant to learn some lessons from it before we proceed into the next incarnation. So basically everything you're going through right now. It was all by choice by your higher self. 

Now when I read this the first time I was skeptical but then it sank in. It makes sense that life is a test. It really does. Just remember you're more than just a piece of flesh that is medicated and made to feel like a zombie. You're an actual human being. Actually scratch that, you're a spirit within a human being. And you have a purpose. And you have the potential to lead and live a beautiful life just like everyone else. All if you overcome certain hurdles that are only meant to test your strength. 

And if its any hope, remember that a lot of people recover from this disease. It could be (EMPHASIS ON COULD) your raging hormones or your brain developing. But it is possible that you heal and learn coping mechanisms, and one day be completely symptom free. So never lose hope, and remember life is transient and not to take anything too seriously. As long as you're on therapy it'll all work out. Its all good in the end. Handle it."

They'll expose your insecurities and expose you, and embarrass you like its nothing. An Aquarius will do it politely, a Virgo will shout it from the rooftops.

Ever heard of the saying: ""hate makes you cautious, love will make you grow?"". Yeah. Implement that shit. 

Advice to all Geminis/Libra/Pisces/Cancer a bit and every sign that lacks confidence (the underdogs). You're better than you think you're. Just need to believe in yourself and have some more confidence (like the fire signs). That and you have the potential, just need the discipline to put it in place.

I agree. But I also do think you're projecting to a degree. Usually Sags are the ones with the blunt crude humour, which sometimes brings others down lol. However as a Gemini I never take it personally and wish everyone else was the same. People get too sensitive for no reason when it's all lighthearted. 

Out of my Sag friends I've also known one that spoke behind someone's back (another Aries friend, it seems you fire signs secretly hate each other for some reason lol.. and it was in the same holier-than-thou manner). And another Sag who is even more flaky than I am (a Gemini), completely unreliable. And yet another Sag who was very stubborn. Another Sag who had an explosive temper. My point is that even the most moral sign can have some bad examples. 

It seems sometimes you Sags are blinded by the fact that you're moral and straightforward which leads to you neglecting the fact that everyone has a dark side. And you dont accept that so you start projecting it onto others. Us geminis are aware of our shadow selves (and if we're good enough actively try to keep it in check, something we share with Scorpios). Thats what the duality represents. So please stop making it seem like we have no conscience lol. I'm not saying we're  perfect either. I actively try to be a better person with every day. Growing to be more self-aware, active and consistent. 

I still love the Sags in my life. You bring out the best in us. The sunny optimism and visionary spirit is great. Couple that with a great sense of humour and a set of morals and its set. Actually *good* people . Its just the judgemental attitude and self-righteousness can be annoying at times.. However IT IS necessary sometimes, too much open mindedness is also a bad thing. 

You guys are great. There's definitely a lot to learn from you people. I guess its true opposite signs balance each other out. 

Plus I also agree its annoying we're labelled the children of the zodiac. It is true though we stay youthful all our lives so can't complain lol.

astrology,fib5wi2,t1_fib5ojk,1582315263.0,I agree
astrology,fiaohuu,t1_fiake0i,1582305269.0,"You know what I think? I think every sign has its faults but for some reason when it comes to Geminis everyone is quick to get on the high horse and look down to judge them. It gets really annoying at some point, even toxic. How can you hate on someone for being themselves when they've barely hurt you? Even Pisces which is supposed to be the most empathetic sign tend to judge (when they can be even more hypocritical than us but you don't see anyone talking about that). 

Now let me ask you this. If you met a toxic Cancer or lets say Pisces. Would you attribute his toxic behavior to just his sun sign and therefore judge 1/12 of the human population in the process? Or would you look for other indicators of toxic behavior in their chart? Of course you would do the latter. But when it comes to Geminis for some reason, probably due to the stereotype, everyone is quick to lump them all together and make it the sun sign that is the problem.

The coolest people I've seen who accept us for who we are would be Aquarius, Scorpio and Leo. Virgo/Capricorn sometimes. They also tend to be the most perceptive and confident signs so that says a lot.

A little understanding, tolerance and openmindedness go a long way when dealing with Gemini energy."
astrology,fiajwaq,t1_fiai467,1582302562.0,"It has a lot to do with where their Moon/Venus signs. If there are on water/earth/fixed signs they're usually better off. Also Geminis are a lot more innocent than people make them out to be, they're just misunderstood. They tend to have this tendency to spew out whatever is on their mind without much consideration. Without thinking 'wait this may offend that person'. They never take it personally when you say something about them so they expect everyone to be the same. Of course this gets better with age. But you have to understand where they're coming from. Its never from a place of viciousness. The only time a Gemini is vicious is when they're on defense, when they feel they've been wronged, but thats all. Other than that they're as light hearted and chill as can be. To get a better idea think about the age Geminis represent: adolescence.

I'm pretty sure if you bring this up to them in a cordial manner they'll actually appreciate it because they were probably not even aware of it in the first place."

Its all chasing nothing sustainable as someone said. While your Leo sun loves that fire and the charm/attention you're getting as you feel wanted. So many red flags.

astrology,fi90zfr,t3_f6tj6r,1582252982.0,"What I noticed is they tend to like to be the chasers, and in relationships they like it to be about them, some may read this as selfish but its not. Its just they know exactly what they want and have the confidence to chase it. Prepare for lots of fights too, especially when they feel they're not being heard. Oh and lots of roasting too as the others said. Another thing I noticed is the men like stereotypical alpha male traditions, this may come as pushy/bossy or toxic masculinity but its usually not so bad.. usually takes form as having a dislike for over sensitivity/affection and having a 'certain' taste in things like music . Oh and last thing is they show lots of tough love, as a way of nurturing (but then again this person had aries moon too so it could be that). 

Something I noticed is if you show them too much interest they'll get weirded out. Plus if you dont stand up to them you're weak in their eyes. 

Overall its not really a bad placement from what I've seen. However one thing to note is that these people had a decent amount of water in their charts. So they would probably be more considerate and less harsh than someone with no water."

Makes it hard to remain productive when all you do is think about shit. I do feel like I'm growing a lot, and learning a lot too so thats a plus. But still can't wait for that Sag progression. What does it feel like?"
astrology,fi8w2t4,t1_fc5hype,1582249687.0,"I like Scorpio energy. Im a Gemini so I like their deep conversations and appreciate their insight. Plus my Pisces moon also likes the depth of emotions, even if its dark. Cool people. A lot of the people close in my life are Scorpios and they're just real and honorable. I keep them positive and upbeat. They keep me rigid and sober. Its a balance"
astrology,fi8rcoy,t1_f6a676z,1582246560.0,Leos and their memes lol
spirituality,fi7dr0b,t3_f6v6qg,1582219416.0,Pisces season. Synchronicity is on the rise
astrology,fi6by9q,t1_fi2g1kp,1582187359.0,"Pisces moon too and the neptunian vibes are real this season. I feel vulnerable but in a good way. More in tune with my emotions. More relaxed and at peace. Everything is flowing smoothly, it's like being in a dream, but a ~good~ dream. Tranquility is in the air, type of vibes. People are being more thoughtful. Its easier to access my intuition. (etc etc) 

I guess these are the positives of this season, and they can be manifested probably through some meditation to 'de-stress' . Music also sounds 10x better this season."
astrology,fi6bao6,t1_fi5mj7y,1582186487.0,"Hmm, what is that you dislike about us? Genuine question, brutal honesty is appreciated lol"
astrology,fi23jh2,t1_fi20tit,1582070645.0,"Much love to y'all Aquas, the realest."
astrology,fi207d5,t1_fi1ir4v,1582068521.0,"You make us sound really 'weak' and unstable lol. Although thats true to an extent, most pisces moons I know that have done some soul searching and have gained some self awareness learn to outgrow that phase to become more 'realistic'. Harnessing that empathetic energy to ACTUALLY help people. Manifesting those dreams into reality. Learning to embrace reality and live in the moment. After all Pisces has a 'strict' side to it that is not usually talked about for some reason.

Pisces is also a sign that has a certain level of self awareness, they're aware of their faults and try to better themselves continuously. Most likely sign to go on a journey of self-growth and self-fullfilment imo.. since they're really spiritual and introspective. 

Another thing I noticed is that they tend to be 'loners' to an extent. We love our solitude and our alone time. As you said this may come off as independence. When really we're just untethered to a degree. We're not really co-dependent either, we're not needy people and are perfectly comfortable in our own skin. 

We can also come off as passive/detached/zoned out. Truth is we really dont care much about the day-to-day mundane. Talking about something like your latest phone and its specifications to a Pisces placement will cause them to tune out real quick. Like the other universal signs, they like deeper conversations and like to take the role of the therapist/guide. 

Ruled by Jupiter they also tend to be more 'positive' and on the 'cheerful' side. Knowing intuitively that its all fine and being at peace with everything. Unlike cancer moons, who tend to be a bit 'cranky' to the daily life. But the advantage cancer moons have as you said is they know exactly why they're feeling a certain way. Plus as a cardinal its easier for them to express their emotions. When with us pisces its harder to grasp our emotions, as strong as they are, they can be confusing at times.

Thats all. This is the fishiest thing Ive ever wrote lol. Blame the Pisces mercury. But I swear the mutables can be a real mindfuck to understand"
astrology,fi1lm44,t3_f4jpax,1582060131.0,"Would be Aquarius. Gemini here and I always look up to them like big brothers I aspire to be like. Intelligent and humanitarian, plus disciplined. Just minus the know-it-all-ness lol and some water too. Plus I like how non-judgmental they are. They only judge you if you judge them

Im a third decan gemini so maybe thats why."
AskAstrologers,fhv657u,t1_fhsuzkg,1581893745.0,Makes sense
astrology,fhv6315,t1_fht28mu,1581893721.0,Wow this is a really interesting perspective. It makes perfect sense and it seems you have a good grasp on astrology as a topic. Your contributions are appreciated
astrology,fhsqt17,t1_fgu34dj,1581864185.0,"Mars in Cancer and Taurus have the ability to become aggressive from my experience. Cancer is more emotional with it. And Taurus charge in like a bull, slow but steady. Mars in Libra however I don't really know."
AskAstrologers,fhspfvb,t1_fgth6st,1581863740.0,Scales can't talk either but just look at a Libra lol
astrology,fhsot48,t1_fgy3sa4,1581863463.0,"I've read somewhere that someone made a prediction of the chart of the Antichrist. And it has an Aquarius stellium. It was really interesting.

Also I'm kind of worried about Saturn entering Aquarius in March 21."
astrology,fhskgux,t1_fhrhq53,1581862020.0,"Speaking of the history of astrology, why do you think it has been suppressed in the past ? And why is it that people just now are being reawakened and rediscovering this system? Does it have something to do with us entering the Age of Aquarius?

I always get this feeling that there's always a bigger reason to why anything happens in the universe. In this case that there is some significance to why it has been suppressed in the first place (and considered occult for many centuries), only to rise in popularity again in recent years. Like maybe we're not really supposed to be aware of all these things, and maybe its forbidden knowledge? What are your thoughts on this? 

To be clear I'm a student of astrology myself, I think its a great system and it has helped me a lot in gaining awareness, its just there's a part of me telling me to tread lightly when learning about it. I dont know what is it, maybe it has to do with all the brainwashing of the mainstream, but I don't know really."
astrologymemes,fhsf54u,t3_f2m0cf,1581860021.0,"So I've been doing some thinking on this question. Basically, the first four signs don't really stand for anything large. They're associated with the self (as opposed to the collective/universe). So these signs are meant to use their talents and gifts to benefit themselves and the people around them. Their goal is rather simple. To successfully fulfill their ambitions. Gemini uses their intelligence to do this. Taurus by their persistence and practicality. Aries by their willpower and determination. And Cancer through their intuition and emotional connections.

Plus why you stressing for no reason? Take it easy. Its fine to be immature as long as you're not hurting anyone and as long as you're using your brain (something geminis are good at). Life is good, don't take yourself and things too seriously. You'll feel suffocated. Get in touch with your soul and heart. See the good in people and most importantly see the good in yourself. Sending good vibes. 

Hope that helps clarify things."

astrology,fhrl8up,t1_fhrc1bx,1581829471.0,"The spontaneity, curiosity and light heartedness. And the crazy electricity we have lol. As well as the logic that comes with being an air sign. Air is really underrated imo, we are civil and non dramatic too, least problematic, i think?"
astrology,fhd7kwo,t1_fcmpddq,1581479061.0,"Immature geminis can literally be the worst bunch out of the zodiac. Followed closely by immature scorpios. Thats why these two signs get the worst rep.

These are the two signs that require the most personal growth through experience, self reflection and groundedness."
