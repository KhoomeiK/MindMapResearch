Is this really a satisfying ending to your arc? There is so much more left for you to do until the end of your story.

Here are some tips just in case you think you are an outcast:

Sometimes I feel like everybody in the world is together except me, and nobody knows or cares about me. But they're just thoughts. I know it's a clich√©, but it's true. 

You're not alone. That's why we came to this place anyway. We're a bunch of outcasts trying to change together. But being an outcast is not a bad thing. You need to embrace your flaws that make you who you are. Making yourself a better person by trying to improve your flaws is good, but don't do it to the point where it changes who you are entirely.

If you keep dwelling on how you are an outcast, say YEY i'm an outcast! 

Sorry for this comment being so long. I hope that helped."
