AskWomen,fqakc56,t1_fq8uh11,1589220532.0,"In the last 17 years of my having periods, I've never attended school, University, post graduation and my job when I'm down. I just keep throwing up and the pain is so bad that I keep shivering and can't move at all. 
Gyn said it's nothing and will get better when I'm 'married' ( indian version of saying have sex ) . 
Apart from that my mom was there when she tried to check my boobs by pressing on it ( it was years ago, I'm not sure why she did it ) and my mom came home and didn't talk to me . When I asked her what happened ( she's usually gentle ) , she said how awkward it was that the doc touched me. I shouldn't have suggested to go in the first place and that I'm not the only one with killer periods. 

That's the only time I went to one."

I told him I'll make sure they agree. But he didn't. He simply gave me an evening to get my family to agree or he's gone. He was gone that night and hasn't contacted me even once post that.

I am all alone anyway so won't create much difference I think.

I've posted a few times on r/depression and r/suicide in the last one year but never got response so I didn't have any expectations posting here but I had to try. I was desperate for some company. And all you good people , you are amazing human beings. Thank you for all this love. I'm not used to it. I don't know how to take it all in. Thank you."
PleaseCallMe,evec2ep,t1_evczlpp,1564462103.0,Thank you. Thank you for taking time to respond. You all are good people.
PleaseCallMe,evec193,t1_evd0drt,1564462071.0,Thank you. It was a rough night. Thank you for replying. I hope the same too. I will keep in mind. Don't be surprised if I ping you. Haha. Thank you.
PleaseCallMe,eveay8q,t1_evd2wn3,1564461011.0,I'm trying. It's been years now . 2 years if I go back and really think about it. I'm just tired of losing all the time you know. I deserve one good news. And I will now get it for myself. I'm done waiting for universe to create one for me. Now it's me for myself. And I really hope better days come soon. I feel a little hollow inside and that hole is growing. But I feel so much better after reading the comments here. I'm not used to so much love. Thank you.
PleaseCallMe,eveat9s,t1_evd4iix,1564460875.0,Thank you. It's overwhelming to be honest. I'm in a bus going to work and I'm overwhelmed with how beautifully you all good people have responded. I'm in tears. I feel a little less sad and your comment has given me courage to go on. Thank you. I didn't know I needed this so much. Thank you so much. You're a good person.
PleaseCallMe,eveaov1,t1_evd1v7f,1564460760.0,Thank you. I never thought of it that way. I just try to share my experience and people here have helped me in so many ways. I want to be more like them - more like you. Thank you for taking out time to respond. It might sound very mean but what you said gave me satisfaction. Thank you . You all are good people here. I aim to become like you all.
PleaseCallMe,eveaf8m,t1_evd1pqf,1564460505.0,"Thank you. I don't consider myself great. I mean I can't even accept it as a formal response. And that's fine. I've had a really rough year. And usually, I stay stable. But there are some nights when I can't keep up the act anymore. I go down my reddit post history and find posts in depression even going an year back . I'm desperate for one good news. One good thing. And I've stopped waiting for the universe to give it to me. I'm going to get it for myself. And I'll not give up - I'll try for as long as I can. I want to be like you all good people who took their time to respond. Thank you. You'll never really know how good your response has made me feel. Thank you. I hope someone is there to pick you up too when you're low."
NarcissisticAbuse,evcwc74,t1_evc1zsz,1564424707.0,"It's like you just described how I was a month ago. During that time I thought that I would never be able to get out of this pain. This weird sadness I'm stuck in knowing perfectly well he had moved on already. Blocked me from everywhere only a week after asking me to marry him. :-) but it will get better. One day at a time. Take babysteps. What you're going through is so immensely painful, it sucks the happiness out of you, doesn't it ? But slowly and steadily, try to keep yourself busy. And workout. It not only keeps your body in shape ( you'll feel better looking at yourself in the mirror ) but it keeps you occupied. It keeps your mental health in check. And you'll start liking yourself again. One step at a time. Don't let their thoughts consume you totally."
NarcissisticAbuse,evbhq6e,t3_cj14fh,1564377841.0,"Woke up dreaming about him today. It doesn't make me sad anymore. Not even angry. It's a very weird feeling. I've spent the first two months crying my heart out. But the last one month , I have totally realised that I was at faults at times too but the way my mistakes were handled and the way his were never ever mentioned makes me realise I don't deserve that. He wanted to marry me. But I deserve a life much better than that. I deserve love. To be appreciated. To be accepted for who I am and he wanted to change so much about me. 
I'm starting to get away from the game. Thank you"
AskWomen,eva2rwt,t1_ev9sm6k,1564337408.0,"Been there. All he did was talk about getting married, then when the time came to actually test our togetherness , he discarded me like you throw something in the trash. All talks."
AskReddit,ev4tdpg,t3_ciezbg,1564221044.0,"IRL -> Soft and smooth

Reddit -> Lost all hopes"
AskReddit,ev4t40i,t3_cif1zw,1564220890.0,My growing likeness for being alone and my constant thoughts about dying and ending it all.
learnmachinelearning,ev4mhiq,t3_cea51m,1564216907.0,The links are broken.
NarcissisticAbuse,ev43nqd,t1_ev26dck,1564207042.0,Yes . Whatever keeps you away from them is totally worth it. I hope you're doing better now.
NarcissisticAbuse,ev1v0bh,t3_ci3gyt,1564165619.0,"Soon, you'll get very strong urges to go back again. You'll feel like maybe you misinterpreted or over reacted. Or that you must have made a horrible mistake. This happens when we think about the good parts of the relationship. So whenever this happens, work on realising everything that was wrong. For me, a list helps. I have a list of all the little things and the big things that my nex did that I shouldn't have tolerated. Things that make your ex a nex. 
I'm here to talk with you. I'm not a therapist . Hell, I'm struggling myself. But I do have interesting videos and I will try to keep your mind off things. 
You can and you will do it. :)"
SuicideWatch,euwz4bz,t1_euwyuc8,1564081314.0,Do it. Start planning on it. What's there to lose ? :-)
SuicideWatch,euwx213,t3_chnpds,1564080607.0,"Do you have a bucketlist ? The list of things you want to do before you die ? Start working on that. Have you every tried star gazing ? Or hiking ? Have you danced on a beach with slow music and waves crashing down your feet ? Have you traveled to a different country and embarrassed yourself completely ? 

I'm asking this because like you I'm planning to kill myself soon. But before doing that, I'm going to try to live every wish I had in the limited time where I think I can manage to stay alive just a little longer. 

I'm here to talk any damn time. I've a lot of ideas to try."
LifeAfterNarcissism,euqx7ta,t1_euqf7o9,1563986591.0,"Sending you an internet hug :-) I hope you find your place soon. And till the time you're driving, I hope you find the patience and courage to keep that faith intact. I wish the best for you. ♥️ You deserve it."
LifeAfterNarcissism,euqx0zj,t1_euqdf9n,1563986511.0,So aptly put ♥️ and we are stronger than the hurricane we left behind.
LifeAfterNarcissism,euqwxxh,t1_euqgccs,1563986476.0,"I know, right. I immediately felt better on reading this :)"
