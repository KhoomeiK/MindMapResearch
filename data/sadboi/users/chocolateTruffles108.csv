I used to take off my shirt quickly to immediately cover my chest, guys would say I'm beautiful but my head screams youre ugly and nobody wants you. Same scenario but he tells me to take my shirt off slowly and to touch my own breasts in front of him, and I say I'm shy, can't, would look weird,etc. Then he tells me it's cute that I think I have a choice... and the self deprecating is silenced in its tracks but that's just me.
Starting with commands done to myself was a safe start personally. Like wear this, touch, squeeze, spank, yourself and such and then tell her to do them to you.

I still fantasize about when my bf played a handful of  songs on the guitar while I laid in his bed with my eyes closed.

It's a mix of philosophizing and using the scientific method to guide you through problem solving.
 Avoid biases though so this means lots of research like mormon history from unbias sources, identify logical fallacies, inductive/deductive reasoning, I took a philosophy class that taught ethical and moral theories, it also taught common manipulation and cult behaviors.
