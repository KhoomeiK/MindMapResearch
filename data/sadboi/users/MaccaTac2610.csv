A workout routine - even something simple, push ups, squats, lunges & crunches 3x a week

Try some sort of learning, a book, youtube, or if you’re studying, do your uni/school work.

Please Don’t hurt yourself, it doesn’t achieve any positive outcome.

For me, quitting antidepressants allowed me to be emotional again rather than being flat/numb, 80% of the time and 20% an emotional roller coaster ( I was pretty angry at one point too). I’ve taken the approach that medication isn’t the be all & end all. It’s hard at first and when you find your feet is up to you.

I started going to the gym, eating healthy, I enrolled into university, I’m trying to keep to myself & develop myself. It genuinely helps to focus on you & what you want in life. Maybe this approach isn’t for you.
I guess a major issue for people is the lack of control in there life (myself included) & retaking that can be hard. Slow but steady!
