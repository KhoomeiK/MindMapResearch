So, saying that men are pervy is a shitty generalization, but saying that women are bitchy, backstabby and get no work done isn't? Why? Because most men aren't actually pervs, but most women are in fact lazy bitches? That's far from the truth lmao.

You're right, if they said MOST or SOME women, it wouldn't be a generalization and I would not have had a reason to speak up. But the person in question blatantly said ""women"". Implying that women, as a whole, act that way.

And *I'm* the sassy one, yet you condescend the shit out of me like ""Learn. The meaning. Of words."" What a joke. Even referring to me as ""sassy"" is fucking cringey lmao, if you were arguing against a man would you describe me that way?

You're missing my point. It's not ""basic generalization"". Notice how it says ""that's just how women act"". Not *some* women, not *most* women, but simply **women**.

It's not a classic case of ""just women things"", you dingus.

What you just said is basically what I started my original reply to you with: sure, certain stereotypes **have their merits and origins.** BUT that doesn't mean that every single person from a particular group acts in line with those stereotypes, which is what the initial comment that got me to speak up was trying to imply."

But actually putting every woman or every man into the same boat isn't right. Nor is it logical. There are way too many people on this planet for every person of a particular gender (or race, or religion, etc.) to act the same. 

People who think women or men are all the same and have these ""trademark"" negative qualities need to expose themselves to more people through more circumstances than just work and school or whatever typical shit. Go out. Literally. Meet people. (not during covid though lmao). I've met so many unique and cool individuals, both men and women, guys and gals who don't act like those stereotypes.

You're failing to realize that my main issue with you is that you seem to be using your mother as anecdotal evidence to generalize everyone with BPD, more or less. If your mom is as insane as you say she is and she crashed a car into a tree or threatened to give your dog antifreeze - that sucks, but that's not representative of everyone with this disorder and you are making it out to be whether you think so or not.

You seem to be talking to me as if I'm your mom. You're taking all of this conversation regarding BPD *very* personally and seem very sensitive to it - look at yourself. You need to step back and realize how utterly uncivil and rude you are being. I have not insulted you once, nor have I put you down, yet here you are throwing nothing but shit my way... and *I'm* the big bad wolf with BPD? 

You called me pathetic, called me a gaslighting cunt, said you felt sorry for my family... I mean, really? Who hurt you? Was it your mother? Because you seem to be projecting a lot of internal hatred onto me with no basis.

All I did was come onto this thread and stand up for myself and others who have Borderline Personality Disorder, because it hurts to see it paired up with the likes of psychopathy, sociopathy, etc. Because I know myself, and I know that I am not some manipulative, emotionless monster. I work on myself every single day and have seen MANY professionals. And you come at me telling me that I'm not doing shit to improve myself. You took my comments so very personally, going as far as to compare me, a stranger on the internet, to your borderline mother, from *one single comment* that I made.

When you put ""see: malignant BPD"" on a thread about toxic people and how someone can be ALL of those people in one, that immediately puts the entire disorder and everyone with it into a negative space that is almost impossible for it to be pulled out of. This kind of shit perpetuates stigma and makes it harder for people with BPD to get help and want help. It makes people feel bad about themselves. It generalizes people. It contributes to how misunderstood it is.

I don't care if you acknowledged that you're nothing close to a psychologist; your behavior shows that you think you know it all, and, if you really know that you're no psychologist, why make such ludicrous statements like ""when they get malevolent it's all the same""? Mental illness is very nuanced and nothing is ever that simple, or black and white.

""This is my opinion based on my experience and education in life"". If you're not a psychologist, don't throw the word ""education"" in there alongside experience. This comment in itself shows that you are just projecting a very biased and negative viewpoint of those with BPD, because of your own personal bad experiences with it.

I'm not entertaining this anymore."

It's just so infuriating and disheartening to see, as someone who actually suffers from this shit. BPD is already misunderstood as fuck and people with it are heavily judged. I do not need some snowflake trying to make my disorder into a ""sexuality""."

depression,fm1tond,t3_fsg8zk,1585684821.0,I teared up reading this. I am so sorry. I had a best boy named Karl. He was the light of my life as you describe your little guy. Always there for me no matter what. He passed away last year. The love our pets give us can't be imitated; it is truly priceless. I wish you and your furry boy the best of luck in life.

raisedbynarcissists,fm0wsb8,t1_fm0wcwj,1585667706.0,"I'm sorry. I feel that. I just see a lot of people talking about how possessive their Nparents are, meanwhile I'm sitting here like... my dad doesn't even know what I'm up to lately because he's that uninvolved with me, even though we still live under the same roof. He *wants* me out of here."
raisedbynarcissists,flhgmqc,t3_foa8yz,1585162268.0,"I have BPD largely because of my narc dad and the way he treated me my whole life. Sadly, however, I also see a shit ton of hatred toward those with BPD as if we are on the same level as people with NPD. Borderlines are not evil people who don't care about your emotions or needs. At least, I'm not. And seeing BPD being equated to NPD makes my blood boil, seeing as how I've lived with a narcissistic father who has made my life, emotionally and mentally, a living hell."
