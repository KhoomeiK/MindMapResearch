The past few days I‚Äôve felt a weird heaviness on my chest, almost like I can‚Äôt breathe, but I know for a fact that if I was truly out of breath/my lungs were struggling, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to walk around the house and do homework and stuff like I‚Äôm doing now. I have clinical depression and struggled with severe anxiety when I was younger (college has made it better actually) and now I‚Äôm worried I might have covid. I am worried sick about giving it to my father who struggles with asthma when he gets even allergies, and my mother who is in her 50s. I haven‚Äôt had a fever or a severe cough. I was smoking weed every day but stopped because I‚Äôm worried about the immunosuppressant qualities of smoking it and the fact I‚Äôm leaving my lungs vulnerable.

Does it sound like I have it? Or do I just have severe anxiety? What to do about this anxiety?"
ibs,fmo1ol6,t1_fmm6bj1,1586242164.0,Yeah! I think anxiety is a big part of it. I‚Äôll eat something before I have to go to class then worry about getting sick in class to the point I‚Äôll actually get sick .. in class.
