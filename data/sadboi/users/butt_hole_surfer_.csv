 If you think it is nitpicky then fine you are entitled to that opinion. However, i was not saying she cant smoke recreationally but given her health issues she supposedly has and her mental health a break might help her as well as help her get healthier considering smoking out of a bowl doesnt help *anyone* let alone someone with asthma!  You are clearly mad because you think people are demonizing weed when its just a simple suggestion that it could help her to quit it for a bit and focus on mental wellness instead of LARPing a chronically ill person. You seem to be taking it personally when it isnt about *you*. 
A nice big bowl of fruity pebbles after smoking a bowl at your kitchen table (probably while her mother is at work contributing to the household) screams unmotivated, lazy stoner. It wouldnt be an issue if she wasnt such a drain on funds and her poor family and actually contributed instead of acting like a petulant spoiled child, desprate to be ""chronically ill"" so she sit around and do this shit day after day and not feel bad about it. That actually makes the people who are seriously ill (and may even use marijuana medicinally or recreationally) look WORSE and it makes it harder for them.
