You're not helping her by enabling her, you are seriously hurting her. At this age she should have a job and be able to pay for at least some of her things. If you continue enabling her, there will never be any motivation for her to want to achieve anything on her own. 

And she could have depression, it is hard to say. She should definitely go see a therapist. Maybe they could help her. I'm sure her lifestyle definitely doesn't help her mental state."

Houseplants are fun to take care of and watch flourish. I have over 100 of them in my home and they make me so happy. I see no reason to be upset with your girlfriend if she is spending her money responsibly. Let her be happy and enjoy life. It is better than her being a depressed mess this whole time."

askwomenadvice,fl174pg,t3_flx491,1584723297.0,"First off, don't compare yourself to others so much! You are your own individual person, and that is a beautiful thing. Maybe you don't yet realize it, but you probably already have your own little ways of being a woman. There is so many other girls out there like you. Maybe they aren't 'girly', but that doesn't make them any less of a woman! 

You will never feel content with yourself if you keep comparing yourself to others. There is no set standard for being a woman. We do not all have to enjoy the same things. There is so many people out there who would admire you for who you are as a woman. I am sure your friends struggle with similar issues, wanting to be like someone else, wanting to dress different or be better at certain things. We all have things that we struggle with. Just because it looks like they have their lives figured out from the outside, doesn't mean that is the case. 

However, if you really do want to learn more about hair and makeup, I would recommend going to YouTube and watching some tutorial videos. This is where I learned to do my hair and makeup. If you want to change your style, use pinterest or Instagram for inspiration. But always remember, you are already a woman. You do not need to change yourself to be like others. Being an individual is an admirable quality in the world we live in."
relationships,fl0yhs1,t3_fltgfb,1584718425.0,"In my own experience, if he is already like this, it could very well get worse. My husband was also babied by his Mom and had few responsibilities growing up. And this definitely carried on to adulthood. When we moved in together, we were already married. 

Pretty soon after moving in together I took on most of the ""housewife duties"". At first it felt good to take care of someone in a way. I grew up in a family where my mom took care of things at home, and my dad worked. So to me this seemed natural. But for my husband and I, we both worked. 

After a while it got annoying. It wasn't just me taking care of all of the household duties, and constantly having to clean up all of his messes. I asked him for help so many times, and he told me he would start to contribute more. But he never actually did. Over time it just started to get worse. He became even more careless, and I foolishly begged him for help. 

I thought maybe if I stopped doing these things for him, he would start to do them on his own. Wrong. Things just never got done, and things went to hell. Looking back, if I had a spine, I would have left him. But I am still with him and things are the same, if not worse. 

Either you should really try to make him understand why you can't be the only person to do these things, or you should leave him. And not waste 5 years of your life on a person who doesn't care about you enough to do simple things that will make your life easier. Because at the end of the day, it really is just a lack of care. If he cared about you and your feelings he wouldn't like to see you stressed out about things that he could take care of. Please don't be like me. Stand up for yourself."

He never ending up taking his life. The feeling of getting out of that relationship was so freeing. After months of being unhappy and feeling trapped. 

Don't let someone manipulate you into staying in a situation you're unhappy with. It will only get worse. I know it seems like it is impossible now, and you feel like you still love her. But the freedom you will experience when you end this relationship will be so gratifying.
