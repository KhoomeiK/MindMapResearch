modernwarfare,fqybop0,t3_gllgro,1589745993.0,"This kind of post is just a waste of your time man. It's just a game. You aren't going to get to play the way *you* want to every single time because others are going to play the way they want to as well. There is so much going on in the heads of different players. There are CDL wannabes that run into you and pop off with their mp5 for practice. There's people playing it safe hiding out trying to get those 3 kills without dying challenges for camos. There's people trying to run up their KD or trying to hit the higher Killstreaks for challenges or just because they want to accomplish something. There's players who just don't know what the fuck they are doing.

Adapt to the situation, play it slower or play it faster. Sit back, or rush. Communicate with your team even if they are randoms. Stick to the outsides of the map so you can catch stragglers in the high traffic areas. Research on your favorite gun to find out it's best attachment and loadout.

You can also play more Ground War as there is no proof that it has SBMM."

Once you recognize the common locations for other snipers and which areas to maneuver through the map to avoid those sightlines you'll get the flow down. Counter sniping you just stick to the outsides of the map and fight other snipers trying to take your nest. Then you are just waiting for them to peak from their flag's or base where they spawn to try and catch you off guard. Scope out to watch for their glint. Sitting on the outside of the map will also allow you to avoid high traffic areas so you're picking off stragglers or enemies on flank routes. 90% of the time they won't challenge you, they'll just go a different way because of the stigma with sniping in GW. It becomes a different game once you get used to it. You'll boost your KD, earn higher kill streaks, and get those challenges done."
