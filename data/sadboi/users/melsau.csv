ptsd,fk66mns,t3_fggcfi,1583894796.0,"Coming from a survivor here it freaks me out to even be alone with a guy in a room to be honest (even if it’s in a professional setting) when they check me out (not good looking and chunky here) it freaks me out because of what happened to me when I was thinner. I hate it when they lick their lips or just come up to ask me for my number. Just puts me in fight or flight more so fast. The only guy I am comfortable around is my husband which honestly it was a miracle I felt comfortable with someone. Even now I hide when I see someone looking me up and down, I don’t feel like I’m above average looking and I’m chunky which normally deters guys"
