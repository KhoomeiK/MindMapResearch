Unfortunately, as I‚Äôm sure you know there isn‚Äôt a pill or a magic fix for an eating disorder. I‚Äôm learning it too, that to get better it‚Äôs your own grit and determination. Of course therapy is really beneficial but at the end of the day you have to make the choice for yourself to defy all the feelings, rules and self hatred that you may feel and do what you know your body needs in spite of it all. 

It‚Äôs such a gruelling process and one that flips in a second from a mindset that you want to do better and then immediately back into the old way of thought. Avoidance of food, restriction and whatever other behaviours that are in the mix are short term solutions to emotional issues and damaging in the long term. Anyone trying to recover has to force themselves into making positive (albeit terrifying) choices in the now to work towards something different. 

It‚Äôs not easy, and I‚Äôm in a similar situation but I really believe that‚Äôs the only way out."

Your eating disorder will not be satisfied until you are gone and that‚Äôs a terribly, fruitless outcome for you and everyone who knows you.

AnorexiaNervosa,fq9upvd,t3_ghnopr,1589207426.0,"Firstly, congratulations on all of your a achievements and the hard work you‚Äôve put in all while managing this illness. The treatment offer sounds similar to the program that I‚Äôve been in (3x now). The decision to take time off is so heart wrenching, I made that choice last semester. I‚Äôm also at university, only one semester from graduating and like you, was barely eating a meal a day. It was getting to the point, for me at least, that I knew getting through the semester may not happen due to increased inability to focus, make decisions and fear of not producing excellent material. 

The way that I weighed the decision was that, for me this has been a 15 year problem and one that isn‚Äôt going anywhere on its own. On one end or the other I will have to deal with it, so the choice became will I continue with school and potentially have my grades/health suffer to make it through (and maybe not) and seek treatment after or step away for a moment, address the issue and hopefully be a better, healthier and more capable version of myself to tackle academics. 

There isn‚Äôt a wrong answer. At the end of the day it comes down to whatever you feel you need more right now ‚Äî to continue study or take a break to get well before continuing. I know how hard it was to make the decision to step away, there was so much guilt and shame but sometimes you need a minute to collect yourself and my university was very supportive. 

If you have any questions about treatment, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out and good luck with your decision!"
