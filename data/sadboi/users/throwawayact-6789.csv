personalfinance,f9krchh,t1_f9kp0gq,1575406320.0,"The problem with the apartment is partially the lease(only 6 months into a 12 monther).  Also I have shitty credit now so relocating may fare difficult.  The rent that is closer to where a majority of the jobs are is more expensive(which explains $700 price)(still cheaper than a car)(bikes cant travel as far as cars).  I think it’s as cheap as I’m gonna get with transportation cost+housing, or I wouldn’t get that much better of a deal from what I’ve seen online.  I have a roomate already.  Great guy, lived together for years."
personalfinance,f9koq5i,t1_f9kdfu9,1575404803.0,Lol it’s a long story.  It was just over spending on stupid stuff like trips and stuff.  I made a bad investment here and there.
personalfinance,f9koet3,t1_f9kbxly,1575404621.0,"Budget:

Food less than $50 a month

Rent is $700 a month

utilities $80-100 a month

Bicycle maintenance $15 a month

Miscellaneous $50 a month

Christmas set me back about $400 between about 20 friends and family members so far(they all help me a lot so like I can’t not buy gifts)

I get free toiletries and soap from my parents for the most part.  Also I’m male so I don’t use make up etc.

I work at bahama breeze(Darden brand).  It’s like a Caribbean style restaurant.   The average check for two is about $35.  I work 40 hours a week already they won’t let me work more.  I’ve tried to get a second restaurant job but it’s weird because all of them say that Friday and Saturday night are mandatory work days(obviously if I have two jobs this isn’t possible).  I’ve applied to Cheesecake Factory and other high end restaurants and even had interviews, but I haven’t had any offers.  I still do about five applications for these types of jobs each week(that are within biking distance).

As far as looking for a different type of job for the daytime.  Idk where it’d be ideal to work or what I’d be qualified for.  I get to work currently for night shifts at 5pm.  I’d probably try to stay away from heavy labor(I live near many ship yards) just because I don’t want to wear myself out if I’m working 80 hours.

And I’m serious into looking for a more profitable job in the future(I’m not interested in being a restaurant manager).  I also would like to relocate to NYC(they are very bike friendly) one day.  Any suggestions would be helpful.

One other thing to know is that I know that during January and February it’s going to be a drought cause a lot of people get obliterated financially from Christmas and can’t afford to eat out.  Summer kind of evens it out though cause it gets busy AF that time of year(we’re famous for our extensive tropical drink menu)."
depression,f9ka7qb,t1_f9k2in8,1575396179.0,Lol idk.  I’ve been overweight at lightest since third grade.  I’m currently 225lbs.  I’m 5’10”.  So like would 150lbs be healthy?  How long would that take?
depression,f9k9z2f,t1_f9k2ayb,1575396028.0,I don’t hate jobs usually.  I’m honestly willing to do anything that pays more money.  Like I’m just trying to find the quickest route to a higher paying job(like a just consider a job something that must be done I don’t have strong emotion towards really).  It could be any work schedule tbh.
depression,f9k0h6l,t1_f9jzpol,1575390080.0,"Thanks I appreciate your input.  Honestly my behavior may be partially to blame.  I play soccer and ride my bike to work.  

Any idea about a low budget keto diet?  Protein is expensive and I don’t know much about what I should be eating anyway.  

I do want to change I just sometimes feel like even if I weren’t fat, in debt with a low paying job that I’d still have no friends or a gf so what’s the point.  

Also I don’t do drugs and only drink on occasion luckily.

Any advice on jobs?"
