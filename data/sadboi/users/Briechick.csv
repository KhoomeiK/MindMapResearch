I think a lot of parents are under the impression that their child will grow out of their weight issues. They may also not realize just how big their child has become."

Then you add in low cost of living area that they live in and that they tend to live with others explains how they can afford food. They aren’t traveling so no transportation or commuting expenses, and for the most part are inside most of the day. Their only hobby is food it seems. They have a severe food addiction that probably comes before buying new technology or going on a trip, or buying a lot of clothes or miscellaneous items. How they dress and look on TV may be just for the cameras when they are in full face make-up, etc. 

I’ve found it easier to spend a few dollars and get calorie dense junk food that is filling but not very nutritious, Or I could spend more money and get lower calorie fresh fruit and veggies."

My600lbLife,fkklan7,t3_fa1duy,1584286594.0,I think what they eat is huge factor in their hunger levels. Eating junk food just causes insulin spikes that result in constantly feeling hungry.  Though they eat so many calories that they should lose weight just by halving their food intake. But keeping their insulin levels high could cause inflammation and slow down weight loss.
My600lbLife,fkkjfle,t1_fke7ypj,1584285396.0,It irritates me that the show allows them to go on such long and unsafe road trips. They could swing a hospital medical transport service.

My600lbLife,fij71oj,t3_f6g7cj,1582436460.0,"Keep healthy food in the house and focus more on good self esteem at any size. I would teach my child healthy food choices that taste good while encouraging them to love themselves more for their personality and spirit versus outer appearance.

I would reinforce living a healthy lifestyle and being honest with my child about how difficult being morbidly obese can be.

I remember being a kid, maybe 9 or 10, and I heard this other kid’s mom talking about me and having a discussion about how my parents could let me get so big. I was about 5 foot 2 and 157lbs. so I was overweight but still super active. That was so inappropriate of that mother.

I could imagine that the producers were not equipped to really deal with the mental health issues that many of those on the show have.
