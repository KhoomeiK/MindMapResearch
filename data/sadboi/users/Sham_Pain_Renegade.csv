I would suggest having it checked out by an urgent care because sometimes they need to be lanced and drained, sometimes packed with gauze if the infection is bad/deep enough. You may also need a prescribed antibiotics.

And slowly, you start finding out who they really are. And that can either be good or bad. 

Now, as far as the depression aspect-yes, it can make you withdrawn, emotionally numb and unavailable, lose interest in people and things that were once enjoyable. But you‚Äôve got red flags all over the place with this guy:

He plays video games in the basement all day, no job, and alcoholic. That‚Äôs a lot to deal with and it‚Äôs going to be a constant cycle of it worsening his depression and the worse the depression gets, the more he‚Äôll drink, withdraw, change, and not be the person you thought he was. But chances are, you think you know who that person is, but you really don‚Äôt. Not long distance like this and trust me when I say I know from experience on this one.

These are the same people who, if by some chance you‚Äôre able to try to interject something about yourself, they‚Äôll find a way to top that with something they‚Äôve done. If they somehow ask you something, how you‚Äôre doing, they really don‚Äôt care, they‚Äôre just thinking of the next thing they want to talk at you about. 

Your poor mom, though! And poor you for being on the receiving end of that two hour word vomit! You handled it well!"

medical_advice,fpxv8nh,t3_gfzdyh,1588990266.0,"I accidentally tore of my entire nail, all the way down to wear the nail meets skin on the top, so it was whole thing. It took forever but it grew back completely with no problems. I think your nail should grow back the same way it always did. And it looks like it‚Äôs healing nicely so as all of it grows out it should be good as it was before."
UnresolvedMysteries,fpxi1gq,t1_fpxhiod,1588983015.0,"Oh, thank you, I‚Äôm sorry I just meant that I don‚Äôt have a whole lot of faith in the SCPD by either them handling the LISK case correctly or not covering up aspects of it. There was a lot of shady things going on in the SCPD during that time. I don‚Äôt live there anymore so I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs changed but I hope it has. But thank you!"

UnresolvedMysteries,fpxd40y,t3_gfstlc,1588980319.0,"I grew up on LI, too and have a deep interest in the entire LISK case since it began. My shop was also enlisted in trying to ID the first woman they found. But I have a personal grudge against the SCPD for fucking up my brothers murder investigation. I hope they can get it together and figure this out once and for all."
