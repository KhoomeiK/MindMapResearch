It gets better. It totally does. 

I spent a lot of time trying to force myself to get better. But the real freedom came when I let go, and told myself that I would get better on my own time. Not everyone needs to be a social butterfly, especially not at that age. Some kids are, and that‚Äôs good for them, but you‚Äôre going to feel better down the road. That‚Äôs a promise. 

Basically, think of it this way. The anxiety isn‚Äôt something that‚Äôs ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with you, it‚Äôs just something that makes you different. There will be people that make fun of you for being different, but the only people that take time to put other people down like that are ones that are struggling with their own confidence. Those bullies are probably going through a struggle just like yours. 

Use this time as a kid to have fun. There will be people that accommodate your anxiety and there will be friends! Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself."

And not just because he was a comedy guy to start with, because they‚Äôre actually great. 

John Krasinski is a brilliant actor, director, and writer, and A Quiet Place had massive acclaim. But I still think a lot of people went into that movie thinking something along the lines of ‚ÄúIt will be interesting to see Jim in a horror/suspense movie.‚Äù It probably got him loads of viewers, which is awesome.
