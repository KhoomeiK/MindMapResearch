i love ‘bad’ endings. typical happy endings where everyones alright tend to bore me. i prefer bad or bittersweet endings, i find they tend to be much more interesting and have a lot more to them.

its useful to make an emergency first aid kit, just in case. getting some gauze and some sanitized pads is good if they wont stop bleeding, and to help protect the cuts against getting irritated & reopening, as well as keeping them clean.
