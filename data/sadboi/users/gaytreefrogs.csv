CPTSD,f6xo8qy,t1_f6wnbt6,1573254016.0,"Honestly, I ended up taking up to 600 mg doses 3-4 times a day. It’s helped me out a lot by just taking the edge off. I’m not sure if that’s the case with you as well where it was just too low of a dose. Has anything else worked for you?"
CPTSD,f6vd4ms,t3_dt7vqc,1573182871.0,"Yes, I will say that I’ve taken Lamictal for about two years now. I got it prescribed for ptsd symptoms and depression. I used it in conjunction with gabapentin and prazosin, which was for nightmares and any leftover anxiety. I didn’t notice the effect for a while because we increased the dose slowly and it took a decent dose for it to actually have an effect. I would say that it helped prevent me from immediately getting angry, allowed my panic symptoms to subside so I could continue through therapy. 

I did get Klonopin for extreme episodes but otherwise it’s just Lamictal and Prazosin. 

It’s the only medication I’ve had that’s had a noticeable effect of improving my mood and had me calm down overall. Of course I still get decent anxiety but that’s manageable. I’ve decreased in my full on disassociating episodes.
While I benefit from it now, I did get impatient a few years ago with it not working quick enough. I’m sure that’s just a common frustration with medication though."

Definitely ExxP,  I can’t see ISTP.  Varying skills and extroverted confidence. Depending on your ego, there’s a couple differences I’ve noticed. Good on taking care of yourself and very involved in the community. I don’t see ESFP though, goin off what I know and what you said-
