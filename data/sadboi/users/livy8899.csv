Dissociation,flyzjpd,t3_frpdc1,1585612322.0,"First of all, trauma is different for everyone. You can be traumatized by something that others aren't traumatized from. It is still trauma for you.

Second of all, if you are afraid you are faking there is a high chance you are not. People who fake mental issues are not afraid they are faking because they know they are faking. 

And finally, i understand why you are scared to talk to people about it, i am the same. It is important to get help but you can wait until you are ready, it's your right as a human being. Just don't wait to it's too late.

I hope you get betterüß°

Edit: I don't want to diagnose you but some of the things you are talking about sound like DID. Maybe you should look into that. I may be wrong so don't take what i say as fact."

AnxietyDepression,fbsvih6,t1_f9ic1p4,1577061374.0,"Sorry for the late response. Personally, I don‚Äôt even remember what happiness feels like. When my panic attacks first started it was back in 2016, deep deep depression quickly followed. I started researching just as you are now, and started self diagnosing myself. After 14 months of this death I finally went to the doctor and actually got diagnosed with everything I self diagnosed myself with. Anyways, nothing ever happened in my life like big changing or anything to trigger my panic attacks (around 10 a day at the beginning) or depression. Even now with the brain fog. I personally think the brain fog feeling is actually a type of dissociation. When life gets to be too much you‚Äôre brain sometimes just detaches itself to protect you. Weirdly enough, I‚Äôve actually been enjoying this fog recently, seems to take a lot of the weight off my chest. Like i said, nothing in my life changed to start any of this, it just seemed to all manifest itself from childhood and finally come out out of no where. I would really suggest going to a psychiatrist, therapist or even just your regular doctor to get a diagnosed. I‚Äôve spent the last 4 years researching and (in a none doctor way) I know a lot about mental health. I hope you‚Äôre doing good or atleast better. 
Also I‚Äôll explain everything I can. 
My anxiety feels like I am constantly on edge and everything is just going to go wrong somehow. I also anxiously research and I have a bit of medical anxiety. I feel pain in my stomach and instantly thing I‚Äôm dying or I have a really bad head ache and think I could have a tumor, etc. I have social anxiety, ocd, gad, panic disorder, and clinical depression. I am not diagnosed with the dissociation I talked about, I‚Äôve not yet brought it up to a doctor. My depression at the moment just feels like numb. I have no feelings, nothing interests me and I could (sometimes do) just stare at a wall for hours. But with the fog feelings it just feels different then the numbness from the depression. It feels like I‚Äôm spaced out, like when you sometimes randomly stare at something and you just get stuck there while your brain just feels empty. I almost constantly feel like I‚Äôm just spaced out and my brain is in a different place. I don‚Äôt know how else to describe it really but colors feel much more dull and everything just feels either much quieter or much louder. I hope this makes sense."
AnxietyDepression,f9iaoep,t3_e58170,1575332386.0,"I‚Äôve been going through the same thing. Not exactly sure what it is. I‚Äôve cut out all caffeine and alcohol too, mostly out of fear. I‚Äôve been to psychologists and cardiologist and regular hospitals trying to figure out what‚Äôs wrong with me. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with many things like social anxiety, GAD, depression, ocd, etc but none that seem to make sense for the feelings I‚Äôm feeling (well they make sense for some but not for this new feeling). I wish I could help you but if u find anything out I‚Äôd love to see an update."

I would be just about to fall asleep, the moment right between sleep and awake, and my body would jolt me awake feeling like I stopped breathing. I had chest X-rays done and I don‚Äôt have anything wrong with my lungs. I am now on a heart monitor because they think my anxiety has negatively affected my heart. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with tachycardia (when heart rate is over 100bpm even when resting) and my highest heart rate was 220bpm. (Very unhealthy obviously). My doctors think it‚Äôs my anxiety but I never felt anything like this for the past 4 years that I‚Äôve had anxiety and panic attacks. I would recommend going to a doctor."
Depersonalization,f5jm1k1,t3_dnsske,1572232409.0,I feel like every person i talk to I have a specific mask I use. I‚Äôve been trying to figure out who I actually am for basically my entire life. Sometimes I have debilitating anxiety when talking to people but other times I am very social and talkative. I am diagnosed with social anxiety and other things so I get confused often about it. It‚Äôs very hard for me to talk to new people and my mind goes blank when they talk to me because I feel like there are so many choices of what to say and I can‚Äôt figure out which to choose. I end up just getting overwhelmed in my head and nodding my head or just saying yes or okay. Like that‚Äôs all my brain could produce.
