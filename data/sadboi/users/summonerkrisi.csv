monster for having bpd. Thank you."
BPD,f5uk8s2,t3_dp78ns,1572475016.0,I obsess over how people perceive me constantly. And I worry way too much about what people think of me. Meeting new people is difficult because I worry they’ll find out past mistakes etc and it’s like the whole mask comes off. Maybe they’ll see me for who I really am and the whole circus tent comes crashing down.  It’s annoying and emotionally draining. I’m seriously ready to get back on some meds and get through this dbt so I don’t feel like I’m losing my mind. 😩😩😩😩

Naruto,f42kxiq,t1_f42jc0q,1571332918.0,That’s the lowest of low for someone to take credit for someone else’s work.

Way to pass on the greatness! <3"
BPD,f3pqqks,t1_f3p19fp,1571063518.0,It’s more so that I feel like I don’t know who I actually am. Like sometimes I feel like I don’t know who I am when I have an episode and end up upsetting people I care about.
oneliners,f3otqaa,t3_dh5nf7,1571028370.0,Same though 😂
BorderlinePDisorder,f3ona92,t3_dhezl1,1571022561.0,Whenever I took a personality quiz I was INFP. I do consider myself to be sensitive but borderline fits as well (I mean I’ve been diagnosed as such). Not sure what I was getting at other than I didn’t see many (if at all) people who got INFP.
stopsmoking,f3m1c2b,t1_f3m0w80,1570981649.0,That sounds delicious. I do love tea! But I love coffee too! I do notice it causes cravings but I’m not  giving in. One month five days strong! 😁
BPDmemes,f3it3y3,t3_dh0kdi,1570941884.0,I feel attacked xD

BPD_friends,f3il7d5,t3_dh26a6,1570938280.0,I’m open to the idea. And anon works for me too.
stopsmoking,f3e4idg,t3_dgk4p9,1570857396.0,I’ve been seeing quite a few people who’ve been drinking tea to refrain from smoking. I’m glad it seems to have worked for you!
BreakingBenjamin,f3d5olo,t1_f3d5lhp,1570832232.0,Okay thank you for the clarification.
sailormoon,f3d0y36,t3_dgi355,1570830531.0,It’s so spot on. I love it!!
BreakingBenjamin,f3d0t5y,t3_dghwc1,1570830485.0,I’m super confused on the title. It only made me love them more.
BPD,f3cx76y,t3_df3cqj,1570829275.0,"Admittedly still learning about this (new diagnosis) so I have to ask
DAE feel like they’re subconsciously a different person depending who they’re around. Ex: a more positive person around a certain friend, acting younger than you actually are, being more flirtatious etc. etc. etc. I saw it kinda posted somewhere else and I’m just not not fully understanding everything. And honestly overwhelmed by my own actions."
BorderlinePDisorder,f34sqtd,t3_dfjpcz,1570659808.0,I’m waiting six weeks til I start mine! Congrats!!!!!
BorderlinePDisorder,f31by9v,t3_df2m0j,1570571912.0,"I literally will skip through genres until a song resonates with me and then it’s the repeat life. 

But honestly when I’m overwhelmed by emotion and it becomes unbearable I will usually put on TPR on shuffle. His melancholy tributes to various video games are really soothing to me. Kinda like a mind reset if that makes sense."
BorderlinePDisorder,f30iij5,t3_df2zku,1570555139.0,You got this! I believe in you!
BPD,f30i9yd,t3_df2aqi,1570554990.0,I thought I was the only one.
BorderlinePDisorder,f2wf3um,t3_deelr5,1570465020.0,I’m glad I’m not the only one feeling this way. I’m constantly waking up feeling intense anxiety from things I’ve done.
PostHardcore,f2wejfv,t1_f2wbt9u,1570464813.0,I really enjoyed that! You’re very talented!
PostHardcore,f2we5v0,t1_f2v0y5e,1570464677.0,Spotless mind is a good one of theirs! That’s what got me into them!
BorderlinePDisorder,f2hu837,t1_f2htghb,1570248285.0,Then I’m doing something right! Anytime! :)
BorderlinePDisorder,f2hsun8,t3_ddhzid,1570247768.0,"Everything I’ve read says to acknowledge and let yourself feel what you’re feeling. Your feelings are valid. Don’t be ashamed and I think if you understand why you feel that way it’ll help you get through it. 

Hope that helps. :) (still working on this myself. You aren’t alone!)"
MealPrepSunday,f27kgi2,t1_f27kbo3,1570040232.0,Thank you!
MealPrepSunday,f27k4gl,t3_dc62nw,1570040018.0,Kinda new to the meal prepping. How do you usually revive your rice when reheating? Mine is always just dry.
