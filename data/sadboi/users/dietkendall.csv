fragrance,fqht399,t1_fqhlycl,1589384042.0,"Yeah, I loved Twisted Lily for the same reason. I’ve never spent less than an hour there any time I’ve gone. Incredible customer service and a really unique selection. I’m realizing my comment was not representative of my entire thought process. I definitely don’t think it’s just Lucky Scent opening a brick and mortar store there. I could totally be wrong about this, and someone please correct me if I am, but certain niche shops already receive a large portion of their revenue from online orders because customers in middle America don’t have a ton of other options. Even just based on posts on this subreddit, it seems to me that go-tos for online ordering from niche boutiques are Lucky Scent and Twisted Lily. In Covid times all orders are online, so people will be looking to these easily recognizable and reputable online sellers. Lucky Scent is obviously doing well considering they have the resources to open a third shop on the other side of the country. Personal preference aside, they will likely fare better than any other niche shop on a national level. If Lucky Scent closes one brick and mortar store they still have two. If Twisted Lily closes one brick and mortar store they have zero. 

Tldr; Lucky Scent and Twisted Lily are already competing on a national level, and now they’re competing on a local level too. Given that brick and mortar stores as a whole are losing business in Covid times, both national and local sales are happening online. So even if both shops lose proportional revenue in terms of local brick and mortar sales, Lucky Scent simply has more resources to survive."

*Secretions Maqnifiques* by ELDO, as mentioned, is the only scent I know that is directly intended to smell like a penis. The primary accords are aquatic and milky, so there's that.

*This Smells Like my Vagina* by Heretic: Don't believe they make this one in a perfume, but it's a limited edition candle. Shockingly, it smells reminiscent of a vagina.

*Putain Des Palaces* by ELDO is a pretty loose interpretation of feminine sweat.

*Vulva Musk* by Alpha Musk: Unlike Secrections Maqnifiques, cannot confirm or deny lol. 

*Delina* by Parfums de Marly: I've heard it described as smelling like a clean, naked woman. To me it's a stretch, but I do sort of understand the vibe.

*Leder 6* by J.F. Schwarzlose Berlin is inspired by the fetish community in Berlin.

*SM Cafe* by Strangers Perfumerie is leathery and waxy with a strong dose of coffee. Honestly I think it's more coffee than anything else, but I suppose it could be an SM Cafe above a coffee shop lol.

I think your best bet in looking for a scent like this is something molecular that reacts with your own pheromones and body chemistry. Nothing smells more like a human body than a human body, after all."

It strengthens your skin barrier which I think hypothetically would make it good for the sensitive skin caused by tret. I've seen quite a few retinol treatments that include niacinamide, so it definitely seems promising. To be safe, make sure you know what your baseline is with your current routine though before adding another active. Because like, what if your skin doesn't like niacinamide but you attribute it to the tret instead and end up ditching tret when it should have been niacinamide, ya know?

Also I just reread your post-- you can use your BP wash in the morning and a gentler cleanser at night. I think it's pretty common for dermatologists to prescribe clindamycin + BP in the morning and tretinoin at night-- that's what I did in the beginning :)"
tretinoin,fl35i9e,t1_fl34kix,1584769519.0,"The specifics are totally up to you and your derm, but basically for me once it stopped burning we increased it. So I went up to 0.05% pretty quickly and then stayed on that for almost a year. I only increased to 0.1% a month ago and I actually think it’s too much for me. Essentially your derm will probably increase the strength once he/she examines that it has made a difference in the appearance of your skin and they think it would continue to improve with a higher strength.

There’s always a risk for a certain level of discomfort when you’re dealing with active ingredients, so a lot of doctors will suggest other calming treatments/ingredients to help manage that. A great thing is that since tretinoin is prescription you will always consult with your derm before and after making any major adjustments....very little guess work on your end :)"
tretinoin,fl33fy2,t3_fm5sgd,1584767549.0,"You mention in a previous comment your concern about tret not working since adapalene does not... same “effectiveness” in general doesn’t necessarily mean same effectiveness for your personal skin :) They’re different generations of retinoids with different actives. I think it’s absolutely worth a try, especially given your insurance situation and your hesitance with going the hormonal route. Even if it doesn’t work, then at least you can cross it off your list and move on. Just make sure that if you do decide to give it a go you listen to your derm and use it consistently and wait out the purging stage (if you have one). Start with the lowest concentration and only increase when you know your skin can handle any irritation. 

I doubt anything I’m saying is new to you, but if you’re looking for new avenues to treat your acne this is a really low risk place to start. I’ve never had super severe acne, but a I’ve had lot of closed comedones since 14 and major hormonal breakouts once I hit like 21. I tried quite a lot before tret and I’ve been amazed at how it’s helped with hyperpigmentation, scarring, texture, and reducing active breakouts.

Let me qualify: I’m white. Half Eastern and half Western European. So my experience with perfume until maybe 5 years ago was pretty much exclusively repetitive Western designer frags. When I think of femininity in perfumery I almost always think of the Western perspective, where it’s EXTRA important we notice the intersection of racism, sexism, orientalism, etc.

I feel like the rose of many traditionally feminine scents in Western perfumery have been very airy and timid— almost like they’re watered down. They lack the depth, spiciness, and jamminess of many varieties of roses. I’m sure a lot of that has to do with the price of high quality rose and the difficulty to mass produce a consistent product. But there also has to be something about the lasting impacts of racism and colonialism in there.

That being said, as I’m getting older I’m also becoming a lot more open to overtly “feminine” scents. I had this idea of myself for quite some time that I wasn’t supposed to like “girly” things.

My point is when I was less confident I fell into some of the not-like-the-other-girls traps and thought that abandoning much of my femininity, including feminine fragrance, would make me a better feminist.

My depression brain is telling me I need to end this exchange and stop talking about myself, but my depression brain once told me I had a colony of spiders living in my skull, so I can't trust that bitch.

Elaborating on the comparing down thing: That used to be my de facto response to any unpleasant emotions. This is kind of a shallow example, but I'm a white girl living just outside of Detroit, and I went to a restaurant in the city the other day and had shitty food and a rude waiter. I immediately started criticizing myself...I got to spend $50 on a dinner in a city plagued by a food desert, I paid for sparkling water while a lot of the people around don't even have access to clean running water, I sat in an air-conditioned room while hundreds of people in Detroit live on the streets, I may have been treated worse by the waiter if I wasn't white, etc.  Do any of these things change the fact that I went to a restaurant and had shitty food and a rude waiter? Nope. Is being upset with myself for having a negative experience going to change the socioeconomic and racial problems in the city? Nope. Cool, so it's fine that I didn't like the restaurant.

Basically my point is that emotions are not mutually exclusive. Not even negative ones. I can be self-loathing and, separately but at the same time, be responsibly upset and angry about the political climate of the country in which I live. I can be passionate about advocating for people less fortunate than me and still use my phone to talk about my depression into the void that is Reddit. Same goes for you, yo."
depression,eyzcy1o,t1_eyym9sp,1567614897.0,"Yeah, I totally get that. Unfortunately people with depression can't just ""think it away."" No matter how many coping skills we've learned, at the heart of it we're still depressed people. Especially in times of crisis or severe self-loathing, challenging and rationalizing thoughts seems impossible, if it even crosses our minds in the first place. 

Sometimes I describe my experience with depression as two parallel lines: I know what I'm supposed to do to help make myself feel better, but I can't actually make the jump to doing it. For me, that's why that quote is helpful. I don't have to challenge my thoughts or use my CBT skills...I just have to notice that my thoughts are my thoughts and my body is my body. And for some reason noticing it makes me feel a little less crazy.

As far as sadness and anger being productive, YEP. That gets to me too. I don't think it's natural or good to be happy all the time. And I don't think happiness is the antithesis of depression. I mean, that's why other feelings exist in the first place and why you can experience more than one feeling at the same time. Are you the type of person that compares down? Like, X person has all of these obstacles that I don't have and they're still taking care of themselves, so why I am I such a piece of shit that I can't do that?"
depression,eyy2fty,t3_cz43l2,1567569213.0,"Once in a partial hospitalization program, a therapist said something along the lines of, *""You are the thinker; you are not the thought.

Maybe it will mean something to you, too. 

\*I've tried to figure out the origins of this statement, and best I can tell I think it was an accidental amalgam of some Decartes, Deepak Chopra, and anti-Eckhart Tolle bullshit. I don't necessarily think it's productive here to discuss greater philosophy regarding life or the human condition, so I'm going to be as practical as I can.

I am the thinker. I am the person sitting here writing this. I am a person with severe depression. I am a result of my genetics, personal experiences, positive and negative decisions, and some shitty evolutionary roulette. Because I am depressed, it's also part of my nature to self-sabotage, isolate, self-blame, etc. Many of my thoughts include questioning the existence of my illness (like you!), passing judgements on how I cope with difficult situations, comparing myself with the version of me that exists in my own expectations and in the expectations of others, etc. 

Separating yourself from your thoughts doesn't mean your thoughts aren't real or aren't important. It also doesn't mean your thoughts don't influence who you are. It just means taking control of who you are so your thoughts can't control you. In this case, you're actually depressed. You consider that you may have a self-created personality flaw because you're depressed, and self-blame is a common symptom of depression.
