One of the women who was in my ward had a history of benzodiazepine abuse and the last time she had came in she was high off of MULTIPLE Xanax bars.

She said she didn’t remember the entirety of her last stay because she was drugged the whole time. 

They put adhesive fucking bandages on a woman who came in with road rash. She had jumped out of a moving car because she didn’t want to come.  She screamed when they changed her bandages.

People say weed isn’t chemically addictive, and in a way it’s not in the same way cocaine or heroin are. But people are also addicted to gambling and plastic surgery. It’s less about the substance, more about the person. 

Many stoners are really fucking annoying about it and some really lowkey are high functioning addicts. Like we get it, you can’t go 24 hours without a substance to make you feel ok.

Apparently it’s because King Louis XIV enjoyed watching his wives give birth, and his view of the birth was obstructed by the birthing stools used at that time. It is also easier for medical staff to catch the baby, and therefore avoid liability, when the mother is on her back. 

Throughout history, humans have given birth in a squatting position, or on their hands and knees. Those positions are widely considered to be less painful and aid in a quicker delivery. 

Humans also have big ass heads, and from an evolutionary standpoint, the female pelvis has struggled to keep up with growing cranium size as the human species evolved.

Saw another psychiatrist who prescribed me lexapro in combination with abilify, which is an atypical antipsychotic. Worked very well to control my insane mood swings and kept me stable.

I’m off my meds for the first time in many years, and I’ll be honest, I’ve been extremely depressed. And right now I can’t afford to go back on psych drugs. Maybe once I’m more financially stable I’ll get back on the medication train.
