-She stated in 2015 she‚Äôs still working on MS, and that her mom begs her constantly to finish it.

-The Twilight renaissance. Recently, especially during quarantine, people are starting to rekindle their love for twilight. I think her seeing the new acceptance and love the series is getting could inspire her to finish MS.

-Twilight is her biggest hit, she has to know that most people would be expecting new twilight content. I think if it were the Host her entire page wouldn‚Äôt be dedicated to the countdown or there would be clues pointing to it so people wouldn‚Äôt get their hopes up. 

-She might want to give her fans something to keep their spirits up during these strange times.
