depression,fqbhz9c,t3_gea6mo,1589237334.0,"this is so me!! you are not alone. I am ""best friends"" with two friends that are BEST friends with each other, so I am truly the third wheel in the friendship. As much as I love them both and would never not want to be friends, it is a lonely place to be. I've always been an outsider in any friend group, mostly because I was always playing basketbal or studying, but also because I don't actually open up to anyone. I fake open up...say things that are sensitive but not necessarily true to make people think I'm vulnerable, but would never actually say or tell anyone what I've been through. I don't think people need to know everything about your life to truly love you and know you, that's why we have Jesus!"
