depression,fr0tids,t3_gm0htq,1589806355.0,"This is very normal for people with depression. It's not like being sad where something bad happened (grandma died) and you feel bad for a while (grief) and then feel better (moving on). Depression is when your brain lacks the chemicals required to feel better. There may or may not be a trigger. 

You're in the stage many folks go through where you ""feel bad for feeling bad"". Or, ""how dare I feel bad when I have it so good and others have it so bad"". 

Your problems and feelings matter because they're yours and yours to deal with. You are important because you are you. Yes, you may hate yourself (I too hate myself), but that doesn't negate the validity of your problems and feelings. 

And remember, like everything, depression is a spectrum. There's a light end and a heavy end. Some folks have more of a mood disorder. Some folks feel so bad they are resistant to medication and require hospitalization. Most are somewhere in between. 

Don't gatekeep yourself. Find a therapist you can talk to and start processing some shit. If meds are required then the therapist will recommend a psychiatrist to talk to about getting them. Do not just go to a regular doctor for meds. 

Hope this helped. I'm happy to talk about this more although my work schedule is about to get busy for the next couple of hours. But I will definitely reply today."

What's killing me is that I thought I was being supportive. I did know about her pain. I just didn't know the extent. I've been struggling with depression since I was 10 (I'm 47 now). I thought she and I were good at sharing our feelings with one another without judgement. I thought I was a really good father and not making the mistakes my parents made. I feel like a failure and a fool. 

I hear you about not telling her she has nothing to be depressed about. I've always told her that her feelings and problems are her feelings and problems and they are important because they're hers. Getting on the slope of ""someone has it worse"" just means you ignore your problems and abdicate responsibility to no one. Rich successful people with perfect lives can get depressed. 

> Don't treat her like she will snap at any moment, don't treat her like shes weak and cant handle herself. 

This will be tough for me but I will make an effort and at least try to be conscious if I start to baby her. Her Mom and I have talked about trying to get back to normal ASAP.

Cooking,fpvscvm,t1_fpvngat,1588950955.0,"Well, to a point. Some people don't like a lot of fat. You can also cook with the fat and then trim at the plate. Or, if your raw piece of meat has a bunch of fat just kind of hanging there not fully connected then you should trim it as it's not contributing anything. I, for one, love fat. What I have to do is to make sure I get the fat crisped up without overcooking the steak. That means you have to get away from the traditional ""flip once"" idea. This is done by pros to get pretty grill marks. Fuck that. I'd rather have crispy fat. 

More marbled the better? Yes, but it depends. You want thin marbling not big thick veins that won't break down during cooking time. And it depends on the cut. Ribeyes will have some thicker fat bands but that's expected and for many, me included, a good thing. But if my NY Strip had the same thick fat bands then I would not like it. Also learn about connective tissue. Those are the chewy bits that get stuck in your teeth. They should be trimmed before cooking. 

Look into Sous Vide and reverse searing. Both are great techniques. 

Oh, and as I'm sure you're seeing in this thread there are tons of opinions spouted as fact with steak. Just experiment yourself and figure out what works for you and what you like to eat. If someone says, ""Never do X!"" but you like the results when you do X then you should do X. I think steaks cooked over medium are shit but some people like them that way. And it kills me to cook them that way but I'm not the one eating that steak (thankfully). Now, if someone puts ketchup on a steak I've made them that will be the last steak I make them. They get hamburger from then on. I'm open and understanding about people liking what they like but fuck that shit. I draw the line at ketchup."
Cooking,fpvmk5t,t1_fpvj18r,1588947766.0,"Sure. Marbling is the fat intertwined with the meat. I'm sure there's some fancy term but it escapes me right now (intra-muscular? Something like that, maybe). Google ""wagyu steak"". Those are super expensive and beautiful steaks. They literally look like marble. Why is fat important? Fat is, for lack of a better word, good. Fat is flavor. A ribeye has tons of flavor. Filets tend to be bland. That's why many places wrap them in bacon. It also can help to study the anatomy of a cow. Understand why the filet is so tender due to its location. Why does the brisket require low and slow?"

That's a huge green flag (opposite of red flag). You got a good woman there. That being said, in my opinion, you would be in the right to be mad at her for letting a guy lick her nipple. That's a bit much. It's not cheating due to the context but I think asking her not to play games that involve nipple licking isn't being overbearing.

You have to go by your gut and recognize how you and your partner express affection for one another (ie. Love Language - google it). I guarantee when your BF is busting his ass at work he's doing it for you. He's showing you, through his actions, that he's a strong worker and good provider. He's someone you can count on to take care of you. Modern feminism notwithstanding, he's trying to impress you. Now, that doesn't mean it's working or that it's what you want. But it's important to understand why he's doing it. In a healthy relationship, he would be willing to compromise some and fit you into his schedule. Your compromise would be that you're going to have to give up some spontaneity and learn to work with a schedule a lot more. When both partners do this happily and willingly then you have a good foundation on which to grow a healthy and functional relationship."
AskMen,fpo3pa0,t3_gelnpy,1588777818.0,"I call this the DTR (Define the Relationship) and I think they're very important. But, it depends on how it's stated. ""Are you keeping your options open?"" would put me on the defensive.:""Why? Are you? Did I do something wrong?"" Instead, use ""I feel..."" statements. ""I feel like you and I are really clicking and that there may be a future here. What do you think?"" This lets me know what she's thinking and not making any declarations about what I may or may not be thinking or doing. And then it's followed up with an open-ended (ie. not a yes/no) question."

But, that's the nature of Conservatism. They're followers who don't question authority. They don't go against the grain and want to keep the status quo. These idiots with guns out protesting aren't going against the grain. They're playing like children and are more interested in proving someone wrong than actually being right."
PoliticalHumor,fpnufrh,t1_fpnu998,1588772821.0,"I was pretty young as well. I remember the ""I don't recall"" answers as well. I found them boring. But my family was celebrating that Oliver North was taking the hit for Reagan. Looking back, that has to mean they knew Reagan was guilty. They just couldn't admit it outright."
PoliticalHumor,fpnqtcs,t3_gegtu4,1588770550.0,"I remember watching the hearings. More specifically, my extended family's reaction to them. They loved Oliver North and wanted him to run for president."
AskAnAmerican,fpnqn0r,t3_gegmw6,1588770433.0,"Breakfast: Coffee or an energy drink. 

Lunch: Sandwich or 2. Usually PB&J but also some variation of meat and cheese with a little mayo and mustard on whole wheat sliced bread. 

Dinner: Meat and non-starch veg. Or, if I'm feeling lazy and want to just relax and drinks some beer on the porch, I'll heat up a frozen pizza."
