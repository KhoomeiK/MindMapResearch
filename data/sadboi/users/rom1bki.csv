You guys all play with those chunks of white and yellow text constantly on display ? Plus the ones popping up with the countermeasures progress, the ones shouting at you « hey new side mission opportunity » because you just read the relevant document, the timed missions alert that takes all the screen while you’re in the middle of an intense fight (even when it’s off you get the alarm sound so you won’t miss them anyway)... I mean, fuck all that, it’s terrible. It spoils the immersive and aesthetic experience of this otherwise amazing game.  That’s what I meant."
