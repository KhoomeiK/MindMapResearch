Granted, the topic at the time was studios chasing subsidies from different locations. But having representation is better than none at all. Now, facilities will be chasing... Well, anyone who has an internet connection and is okay with sectioning a portion of their living space for work and a lower paycheck for the 'convenience of working in your pajamas.'

All the while, access to talent will be a lot easier when Starlink is up later this year.

Substance Theory could probably help summarize the point by introducing the speculation of soul as substance, that there is more to the thing-in-itself, and is distinguished from the properties it bears. Though the theory is itself debatable, it is interesting to think about how the mind/soul cannot be pinpointed to a physical ""substance"", as we subjectively think it's ""the brain""."

Before Nuke we had Matador, Cineon, Shake.
Quite a few companies used Lightwave for their CG 10ish years ago, then switched to Maya. Sometimes it was a long transition, and in other cases over night.
The company may even have their own proprietary software, then scrap it just to use off the shelf stuff. At the end of the day, the company is going to look at the bottom line. And if software gets cheaper, supposedly so does the work, or do some Hollywood accounting.
But with larger facilities comes the pipeline, and changing over to one software may negate a lot of time and investment with a particular software's integration into the overall workflow at that facility.
For now Blender may just be another tool in the toolbox. But it's certainly made an impression as of late."
