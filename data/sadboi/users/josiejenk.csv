NanatsunoTaizai,fmxbuyx,t1_fmx8za6,1586462127.0,I really enjoy it! If you like star dew valley you’ll like it! It’s a relaxed game you can pick up and put down whenever
schizoaffective,fl9dviu,t1_fl8eajq,1584951220.0,I was experiencing more delusions and had a total lack of energy or interest in anything. I didn’t feel human anymore. I thought i would be okay when they wouldn’t refill my script when i moved so i stopped trying and then i fell back into a worse place than i was.
schizoaffective,fjgddzg,t3_fbqwb8,1583322902.0,I’m four years in. Had to transfer to online classes. Much more manageable
schizoaffective,fjgdbm1,t3_fcqe0d,1583322829.0,I sometimes see the floor moving like a wave but the worse one was when i was in the passenger seat of a car on the highway and saw a semi fishtail and hit us head on and and i screamed and covered myself and looked up and it had never happened. Scared the shit out of my friend
schizoaffective,fik314k,t1_fijv35a,1582471544.0,I experience the same thing.
insomnia,fi04egc,t1_fi04cgd,1582025913.0,Have u ever been prescribed meds for it? Mine either didn’t work or worked too well
insomnia,fi048dq,t1_fi0472y,1582025716.0,I get it.  I’m up til 4-6am most days too
insomnia,fi042bc,t1_fi03xjw,1582025513.0,My brain does the worst things to me when I’m trying to fall asleep. Advice i was given is that you can’t think of youre listening. Try putting on a YouTube video or podcast you’ve already heard. It might help. I do it pretty often
insomnia,fi03vx3,t3_f5py0v,1582025300.0,Right there with you. I’m so frustrated and it only makes it worse
schizoaffective,fhsif8c,t1_fhsib93,1581861238.0,"I will try this, thank you so much"

insomnia,ff5mt5s,t3_errxc8,1579600743.0,All the time. My husband can fall asleep in under a minute and on any surface and it’s near impossible for me most nights

schizoaffective,f8hxde8,t1_f8edaql,1574581252.0,I’m in Hawaii so I’m off Continental US. Trying to get an appointment with a local specialist
depression,f8dsf5u,t3_e0gk69,1574507790.0,I understand. There’s really nothing they can sag that helps sometimes. It’s insulting when they say exercise will fix your problem but also heart when they don’t make an effort to help. Empathy and listening I believe is best. And I’m here if you need it
depression,f8ds9i6,t3_e0gkhb,1574507623.0,You are not in that boat alone. There. Are lots of us who become apathetic toward our own self. Including myself. Lean on us. It’s not pathetic at all.

schizoaffective,f8drhl8,t3_e0b0ws,1574506653.0,"I struggle with paranoia. One of my biggest delusions is that there is a clot in my brain that’s going to kill me. But my therapist taught me a mantra “i know what I’m feeling/experiencing, but it’s not real” and i say it over and over until I’m calmer"
insomnia,f8dqyda,t3_e0crda,1574505953.0,I have. They usually are like “well if you got off your phone or didn’t drink coffee...” blah blah. They don’t get what insomnia is really like
insomnia,f8dqwd9,t3_e0fkj9,1574505861.0,I feel the same way. My husband can fall asleep in under a minute at any time and I’m lucky if the sun doesn’t rise first. So frustrating
insomnia,f8dquru,t3_e0g75u,1574505788.0,I play mobile mindless games or scroll on sm
insomnia,f5oy7rw,t3_domnq0,1572339073.0,I have. Lavender is calming but doesn’t make you sleepy so to say. The diffusers that come with the lights with the lavender is a good pairing.
schizoaffective,f5a9kqp,t1_f5a93yf,1572103022.0,Yeah I’m manic in my head but my body Doesn’t want to move so it’s infuriating. I’m hoping getting in with the specialist here will allow me to get everything back.
schizoaffective,f59qo0x,t3_dmjyul,1572093956.0,I’m right there with you. Take those small victories and try to  reward yourself instead of comparing to a normative
insomnia,f59p37m,t3_dncob0,1572093232.0,Nope. My husband falls asleep within minutes. I’ don’t understand
insomnia,f59owij,t3_dn9pbu,1572093133.0,All melatonin did is give me a headache
insomnia,f49n1jo,t3_dk0i5g,1571474792.0,Breathing in 4 hold 8 out 7 and repeat at least 10 times can have a calm reset. Then just focus on you breath rising and falling. It’s hard but it helps

cats,f45nanb,t1_f45n8hf,1571385162.0,He’s a male and is very social. When new people come over he just stays in his usual comfy spot in the living room and even lets them pet or play with him. He doesn’t like toddlers but that’s not the problem 😂
cats,f45n6sw,t3_djk4n9,1571384997.0,Mine does the exact same thing!
insomnia,f2qwfgy,t3_dde3xs,1570367364.0,Thank you for sharing i need to try this. I get so frustrated with myself for hours trying to sleep

schizoaffective,ew61kyg,t3_cmvlod,1565151021.0,Is that real or in my head and it’s okay I’m not dying i think but maybe and  why
depression,evnpp7p,t3_ckipu1,1564629576.0,"I’m on it now. I’ve tried probably 6 other meds
Prior to this and this is the only one that has worked well enough for me to establish a baseline. Try to drink lots of water and don’t miss a dose 💕 hope it helps"
