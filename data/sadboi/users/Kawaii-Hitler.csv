The hardest part of getting sober is figuring out what to do in your spare time. Normally whenever we’re bored we’d smoke a bowl, but now that we don’t smoke what is there to do with our time? It can drive you insane, but don’t let it. Force yourself to read a book or something. Just get through it and eventually you’ll figure out a flow.

Final piece of advice is exercise. Whenever you’re having a craving go to the gym. You can still get your dopamine fix, you just have to find a healthier way."
