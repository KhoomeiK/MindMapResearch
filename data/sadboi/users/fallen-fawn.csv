In the beginning it would get so bad that my whole upper torso would be in a muscle spasm for days. Now it‚Äôs super manageable.

Here are things that have helped me:

-Recognizing that it‚Äôs caused by anxiety, and recognizing that it‚Äôs a very common problem that many people deal with

-Learning to ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù with my body tension multiply times throughout the day and doing ‚Äúprogressive relaxation‚Äù where you tense your muscles and then relax them. My therapist taught me this actually. Being body-aware is what helped me the most I think.

-Going to physical therapy. They did pressure point massage on me as well as helped build strength in my ‚Äúanxiety muscles‚Äù because they can spasm up when they are weaker.

-Watching my posture. I didn‚Äôt believe this could make a difference at first, but it really does.

-Medication. I‚Äôve taken muscle relaxers before for acute situations. And when I took anxiety medication I noticed a positive difference in my muscle tension too."

CoronavirusWA,fl7l8q5,t1_fl7kmhj,1584904062.0,"Yeah definitely my original cough was not COVID. But it went away for like a month in February and then 8-9 days ago the cough came back, but worse, with other symptoms. Which made me wonder. I am definitely sick with some kind of virus right now. But could be just a cold."
CoronavirusWA,fl7h881,t3_fn3ny8,1584901680.0,"I had an awful experience trying to get help through UW Medicine and wanted to share this so others could be prepared for how the response system goes.

I have mild symptoms, no fever, but have had a cough for like 6 months now. Everything got worse 8-9 days ago when I got back from a trip to Miami though. Which is why I decided to contact my doctor.

I initially sent a message describing my concerns through eCare (online patient portal) since I know they don‚Äôt want people with respiratory issues walking in. It took FOUR DAYS to get a response. And when I did, it was just a copy/paste message telling me I can‚Äôt come in to a clinic but instead should try the ‚Äúvirtual medicine‚Äù video chat service.

So I tried to do that the next morning. The wait times were insane, 30+ people ‚Äúin line‚Äù to see every doctor that was available. But what made it worse was the system would show error messages that ‚Äúthe doctor lost connection‚Äù multiple times, would boot you off, then put you back in line with someone else, but now you‚Äôre at the back of the line again. And then randomly other patients would get in front of you in line somehow. This became FIVE HOURS of me staring at my computer watching my place in line update because they don‚Äôt have an option to just call you when a doctor becomes available. Finally I was next in line. Then it said the doctor was ready for me and reviewing my information. Then.... it notified me the doctor DECLINED MY REQUEST and it kicked me off. No explanation was given. I burst into tears because I felt like this was my only option of getting help, and no one would help me.

Eventually I decide to see if I could schedule a ‚Äúreal appointment‚Äù video chat with a doctor, but the number they provided for scheduling had no one pick up. So I tried to schedule it online, but even that service wasn‚Äôt working. I do some more searching and find another phone number to try.  Finally, a secretary answered the phone and was able to schedule me a video chat for the next day.

The doctor I spoke to was really nice and informative, and he took the time to go over my concerns in depth. He said he didn‚Äôt think it was COVID, more likely just a cold, and he prescribed me a cough suppressant and inhaler. He did not tell me to quarantine or anything. I personally feel like it could be anything still. Who knows without testing right. He said if it‚Äôs still here in a week I should call them again. I am still (understandably) not allowed to walk in to a clinic.

One more thing happened after the appointment that is worth mentioning- my pharmacy robot called to tell me my prescription could not be filled because it was out of stock. I had to call back to find out which prescription and when they thought it would be back in stock. It was the cough suppressant, due back in a week. And I had to ask them to notify me when it‚Äôs back, apparently they weren‚Äôt going to do that without me requesting so.

Moral of the story:

-If you have respiratory symptoms, don‚Äôt bother with an initial email message. Just call them immediately to get something scheduled asap. You don‚Äôt want to wait days like I did.

-The virtual clinic is totally overwhelmed and dysfunctional, not even worth trying imo, but if you must use it and do end up talking to a doctor, please try to be quick and to the point because there are hundreds of other people waiting in line.

-Pharmacies may be running low on some meds. Get what you need asap, without hoarding. If something you need is out of stock, be sure to ask them to notify you when it‚Äôs back.

If this is just the beginning of our medical systems being overwhelmed, I am really scared for the coming weeks/months."

I am by no means an expert. But here is my experience and advice:

-It feels a little weird being closer in age to his kids than him, but that‚Äôs fine, just accept it and move on, it doesn‚Äôt have to be an issue if you don‚Äôt make it one

-You will quickly realize you ARE a different generation than the kids, have less in common than you would expect, so that‚Äôs a good thing. They actually make me feel old and dorky all the time.

-Just talk to them like your peers (except obviously nothing inappropriate), don‚Äôt treat them or talk to them like little kids

-Are they close with their mother? Or do you feel pressure to be ‚Äúmotherly‚Äù toward them yourself? I‚Äôm glad that my boyfriends kids are very close with their mom and see her often, because I know that I am not in a place in life where I could be a great mother figure toward them. However, I can still care about them, be there for them when needed, try to be a positive role model and a good person in their life. I think that‚Äôs what matters in the end. Just that you care.

-Lastly, I would suggest putting in a good amount of effort to get to know them and always ask them questions about themselves and what‚Äôs going on in their life. Even if they are quiet or shy around you. You are the adult in the situation and it‚Äôs more important to show them you care vs being worried they don‚Äôt ‚Äúlike‚Äù you or you aren‚Äôt cool enough or something.

Overall don‚Äôt sweat it too much. Just be yourself. If you and your partner really love each other that will show, and that‚Äôs all that really matters :)."

AskReddit,fb8s9xm,t3_ebuquu,1576620739.0,"‚ÄúWhat have you been doing to lose weight?‚Äù

Answer: I ate less.

I know this may seem rude of me, I do understand people wanting to ask this question. But as soon as I hit the 20 lb weight loss mark, EVERYONE started commenting on my body and asking me how I did it. Is it really that bad to not want people talking about your body? It‚Äôs all compliments, I always just smile and say thank you, but it makes me uncomfortable. Especially because it shows what they thought of my body before by not saying anything. I hate how much our bodies affect how people view us. And no one wants to believe my answer is as simple as ‚ÄúI ate less.‚Äù

Also, people can lose weight from illnesses (which has happened to me in my past) and if that‚Äôs the case then it‚Äôs super awkward to bring up. During that time, I felt like people were glorifying me as a weight loss success story but in reality I was losing weight from having constant nausea and bloating from a major digestive dysfunction, aka I couldn‚Äôt eat if I wanted to and I felt terrible all the time.

I think a good rule of thumb here would be ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bring up someone‚Äôs weight loss or diet unless they do it first‚Äù."

It wasn‚Äôt really him that I loved or our relationship, I was just stuck in the cycle of trying to prove myself and fix things.

I wish you luck going forward. Please be safe when you decide to leave. There are lots of people and resources here to help you. üíú"

Maybe you don‚Äôt know if you were abused, but neither do they. You might be able to work with a therapist to uncover buried memories. But honestly over the years I have learned to trust my gut, it is usually right about bad situations when I look back. And especially if you know he was abusive to other people... that pattern means a lot. At the end of the day, if you did what you did with the intention of helping people, you shouldn‚Äôt regret it."

I think we will come out of it, eventually. But I don‚Äôt think you should bad or guilty about missing work. This is what really matters in life. The people you are close to. A job is just a job.

I hope you feel better soon. Thanks for posting because it gives me validation for myself laying around the house all day and missing work."
progresspics,ex0ukyt,t1_ewzpllp,1565922585.0,You look great! Thanks for sharing what you did to get there. I have a couple questions though. 1. How many calories did you usually end up eating then? If I subtract 1000 from my TDEE I‚Äôm at like 800 max... you ate more than 800 calories right?? 2. Were you losing 2 lbs per week fairly consistently or did you have weeks where you wouldn‚Äôt lose any weight despite putting in all the effort? I‚Äôm just trying to figure out what is realistic and what to expect. 3. Did you focus on eating healthy foods or low sugar/carb or anything? Or did you still eat whatever you wanted? Thank you so much if you find time to answer.

I have been around long enough however to know of the reputation seattle has for being passive aggressive, and comments like yours certainly support that."
SeattleWA,evxtm9j,t1_evxosze,1564907112.0,Thanks for the kind reply.
Cooking,euekw81,t3_cg1qoe,1563746926.0,"I know this is not affordable for everyone, but meal kits like Blue Apron and Hello Fresh have helped me so much. The food in them is a lot healthier than what I would make for myself and it kind of teaches you how to cook. It also saves a lot of time from going to the grocery store or finding recipes."
