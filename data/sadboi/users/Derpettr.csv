relationships,fnzu3nq,t3_g4w2kz,1587400779.0,"Using language like this shows a basic disrespect and disregard for the feelings amd struggles of those that they are meant to be deragatory towards. I had an ex that used language like this and it bothered me alot too, I always wish I wouldve said more about it. At the end of the day he was borderline racist and a complete manipulative and overcontrolling asshole and Im glad I ended up leaving. I dont want to tell you just to dump the guy because obv I dont know your whole story but I really feel as though this is a sign to a deeper aspect of his personality that you clearly fundamentally disagree with (which is a good thing imo) and at the end of the day you have a lot of life to live and people to meet that could match your morals better"

relationships,ertkf0s,t3_c3ubq7,1561244958.0,"My last relationship lasted 3 years. I just want tk say that if he can see how his actions are being percieved and is willing to work on in and activrly change then thats great but just because youve spent time with someone doesnt mean youre obligated to them. Im currently in the best relationship ive been in and while there certainly are issues from both sides, there is defintley a strong desire to grow with and love eachother that I rarely if ever felt with my ex. I was hesitant to leave because I truly thought we would end up together but sooner or later I had to confront myself with the fact that the good times were too few and far between to warrant the issues, which coincidently were issues with him being overbearing and over controlling.

 All Im saying is that you need to look inside and make sure you are happy and if youre not you shouldnt let anybody, regardless of time and efforr put in,stand in the way of that. Speaking from experience, the leap is worth is and in this case  the grass really is greener on the other side.

Edit:I would like to add that the fact that he has locked you out while you were drunk and told you to get an uber is a very big red flag and leads me to question his concern for your safety, not sure if someone mentioned this already or not"
depression,erthr8v,t1_erthian,1561242752.0,"For reference, im 22 now but I would say the first time I dealt with depression is around 14. There have definitley been long periods in my life in amd out of depression, and right now Im coming out of a down period but its still difficult and the feedback this forum provides is helpful and endearing so its good to utilize what tools you can."
depression,erthian,t3_c3upba,1561242545.0,"I understand that being young basically means that youre at the mercy of the adults around you but I hope you stay strong through it. It may not be easy for OP to just switch to a new doctor since by the sound of it, her mom may deny that shes having issues or downplay it and not act upon her situation. While seeing a professional physician or psychologist is the best and most recommended route, you have to make use of what you have. I would recommend taking time to see a school guidance counseler, or school psychologist if you have one since they can provide the most educated advice on what youre going through. At the very least, its an adult that can listen to your problems. 

I am 5'4 and in highschool I weighed 185+ so I can relate to how you must be feeling. In the past few months ive found that painting and looking for local nature trails and parks to walk has been really helpong me prevent some bad days when I can gather the motivation to prevent them. Maybe that could help you too as its cheap/ free, easy to do, and healthy."

I'm also 22 and have been feeling like this since probably end of middle school/ start of high school.
