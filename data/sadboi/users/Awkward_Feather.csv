TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fmkcq6b,t1_fmjwdqs,1586150728.0,I’m in Escondido and Friday was definitely stronger. 3 long shakes to the house and two after shocks. Today just the shelves vibrated for a few seconds around 4-5pmish?

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fhy7y84,t3_f58hod,1581970479.0,"Alright, I’m probably more upset about this than is reasonable but I’m blaming it on the fact I’ve watched the show for almost 10 years so I’m invested lol

Why does Cate specifically always get the worst MUAs or stylists??? Like I get for Hollywood/LA she doesn’t have what would be considered industry standard beauty but Jesus GAWD Leah I’ve seen Mama June show up to red carpet events looking better. Not saying this was a red carpet event but she’s at least a person consistently on MTV and took people’s money for this. I’m not famous so no idea how it works but doesn’t she have any experience or someone to tell her “this is awful”???

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,eya81u2,t1_ey9yzu3,1566959521.0,Is that what this is? I’m trying to understand why this was made. Did she just wander into a studio coked out of her mind while some other comedians were recording and they thought they’d just let the cameras roll? What’s happening?

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,etdf749,t1_etczvao,1562705370.0,I’m wondering if Andrew working in the industry is working in her favor. HE knows to keep his mouth shut to stop the media shit storm. Or maybe Amber had a rill movement of clarity in gel after Jenelle-gate. I’m leaning towards Andrew and his lawyers tho.

How did you go about deciding this was something you wanted to get done and stretch as far as you have? I have plugs in my ears so I get “oops I guess I’m two sizes bigger than I planned” thinking lol this is just (what I would imagine to be) a very sensitive area

The other question I have is does it affect...anything? Especially with the size? 

Side note that I like your Jacob’s ladder and appreciate your time to answer questions!!"

I have never rooted to hard for people I’ve never met.
