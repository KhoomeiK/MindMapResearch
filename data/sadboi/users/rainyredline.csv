DJs,es9wwci,t3_c6lspj,1561746367.0,"iâ€™ve been doing a lot of mixes with Mac Miller recently. i do mostly hip-hop based mixes. 

One of my favorite transitions iâ€™ve done and canâ€™t stop doing/listening to is Big T*****s by Rico Nasty into Hurt Feelings by Mac Miller. 

I did a transition/mashup with Soulmate by Mac into One in A Million by Aaliyah that was received very well. I combined the hook of both, and theyâ€™re in the same key (had to speed up soulmates BPM to match the Aaliyah song) then transitioned that into Broken Girls by Saba, which i then transitioned into Us 2 by Toro Y Moi. All my friends lost it on those transitions/mash ups. it was about a 7 minute long mash up really."

chicago,errlit6,t3_c3iaje,1561174319.0,"used to work there;

if thereâ€™s no pit GA itâ€™s sold out. find a resale. it becomes a safety hazard when thereâ€™s too many people on the ground, i mean the floor shakes when people jump and you can see it in the restaurant below.

 GA balcony will let you on the balcony in front, thereâ€™s private booths sometimes saved for those that the artists guest lists."
AskMen,errfxpr,t3_c3glbl,1561169346.0,she doesnâ€™t like the friends i have. iâ€™ve always had shitty friends. my friends now CAN be shitty but itâ€™s unintentional and they have a good heart. sheâ€™s weary about me trying to meet new friends at times cuz of my trust issues from past friends due to this.
