I only add here what I have actually read. I corrected that person
I don't make statements about facts that I know I did not read so I corrected the person because their statement was misleading and now you want to pipe up because I am discussing the cousin and the sleepover.

Like I said a very unpopular opinion. It's not mine originally, and I've never said it was her. Ever. What I have said is they were up into the night whispering and about what no one has any idea. I think its possible someone known to her could have been involved, no one knows, but that could still be possible even if her cousin knew nothing about it.

At the end of the day someone must know something, so the best place to start is with her movements and interactions in the immediate time period leading up to her disappearance.

And like I said, no one knows what questions were ever asked of these people. So we just don't know. No one knows. Not me, or you either."

UnresolvedMysteries,fq365zk,t1_fq32xu8,1589063376.0,"A few people have asked questions about Catina and if she may have had knowledge of any reason for Asha to leave or known anyone who may be involved even if nothing to do with her personally. Its usually a very unpopular opinion and people get upset about it. I think it is interesting though. But since we don't know anything about what questions we're asked her in the aftermath, we really have no idea. I do recall a news article that said the day after Asha disappeared, her cousin was just sat 'slumped in her chair'. Could have been genuinely shocked and dumbfounded by it, or another emotion? Who knows but from everything I've read, apparently everyone was questioned. But we have no idea to what extent and about what. 
I wish I had links to put here. I just know all this is buried in the threads and news articles. There was a site called 'scribd' that had all the news articles from the time, as the search was happening ect... I don't know how to find it though. I've read so much on this case over many years."

Which means Internet activity somehow unbeknown to anyone, or that maybe he didn't really loose his phone, wrote letters (which I doubt, but I'm just saying it because it's a form of communication) or used a payphone or met someone in person and discussed whatever he was planning.

I personally don't think he did go to London to meet someone, maybe to look for something or someone or see something?? But not a pre arranged meeting with someone. I used to run away at 14 pre mobile phone or Internet era, I had neither, and when I went places I just went, sometimes looking for someone but they wouldn't have been expecting me.

Anyway I just go round in circles with it. Nothing makes sense. And anything is possible.

AndrewGosden,fpblwwj,t1_fpbkqhl,1588473059.0,"No I know that. But with the info I provided, and this is just an example...

 If they knew it was the missing person, they can call police, inform them, the person parents are informed their loved one is alive and case closed. (but the answer I'm being given is they can't do that or they are breaching confidentiality.) 

I'm not saying the agency should disclose to random me unknown caller on the phone. And I'm not saying it should be the case if the person only been missing a short while. But in cases like Andrews it doesn't sit right with me. 

Then they either regain communication and or the family have to accept the person wants to remain missing and maybe never get answers but the case is still closed."
AndrewGosden,fpbjvdu,t1_fpbjj00,1588471690.0,"Because basically the answer to my question is that Andrew or Carmel or any other missing person can be out there living life and people can know that to be the case but it's still an open investigation? And its OK they are doing that (assuming it's by their own free will) also if the missing person is using assumed name, different identity to their birth one, is that not fraud anyway?

This has me so confused."
AndrewGosden,fpbjj00,t1_fpbi0n1,1588471466.0,"We were not asking that though. We didn't want a random person identity. It was a quite high profile uk missing person case and a photo twenty years later of a rough sleeper who possibly bore resemblances and we were asking questions.. 

Well, maybe it is the same thing.. BUT if no one is allowed to report a sighting if they come across a missing person whilst at work in a professional capacity, and the onus is on the missing person to come forward themselves; then really what is the point of anyone looking for them, investigating or investing time, discussing theories like we do on Reddit or Anything? 

Because even if someone does know they're out there, unless it's just a random public member, they can't say so?

Why bother contacting any agencies that may have come into contact with that person with their missing appeal info!? What is even the point of any missing appeal really? 

I totally understand a person right to no contact, anonymity ect... But I think also a case should be able to be closed. Even if missing person does not want contact or anything. At least it would provide some closure, even if more questions were raised, the family would know they not murdered or something."

AndrewGosden,fp7hnzj,t1_fp7gkwb,1588370810.0,"Just before I came back on Reddit tonight, I was thinking about this with regards medical professionals, and thinking about how people say 

""...If Andrew went to a hospital or opticians ect and someone working there recognised his ear...""

Basically, that person wouldn't be allowed to say anything anyway...I mean, they could do, if they realised and were genuinely shocked or felt compelled to.

But if the person did not want to be found, then took action, complained or took it further, right or wrong the person may loose their job or end up involved in drama they did not want. 

(thats if whoever saw or recognised him even cared, I also thought that because we all care about this case, many others probably could not care less. I know my sister for example is not interested at all in any of these cases and when I ever bring them up in conversation she does not find it interesting so the conversation does not continue.)

If someone like her saw one of these people, they either would not even realise, or not care) We just sometimes assume maybe, that whoever it is that might come into contact with Andrew, or Carmel or anyone else missing would even care."

AndrewGosden,fp5u134,t3_g98ldl,1588339893.0,"My theory on this is that a lot of younger people who are actively discussing this case grew up after the Internet really took off in the UK and they cannot really fathom a world where people didn't all own smart phones and have active online and social media presences. 

In 2007 when Andrew disappeared, in the UK a lot of people were online, but a lot were not either. When I joined the Internet and Facebook in 2006 it was so boring, no one I knew was actively using it, not like today. NOW my 18 Yr old tells me that 'only old people use Facebook, everyone is on Instagram now. I cant get my head round Instagram though. 

A lot of other social media platforms and websites didn't even exist in 2007.

I had a MySpace, but honestly I did not really know what the possibilities of the Internet were, because I grew up without it. It wasn't until about 2010 that I got my first laptop and really began using the Internet and found forums I was interested in ect.. 

You also have to bear in mind the UK was very much behind the US with regards Internet usage too. So US contributors to this sub are also applying their experiences. 

Not everyone had smartphones in UK back then, from conversations I have had people seemed to use better phones in the US than we did around that time. My first smart phone that was anything like comparable to the one I have nowadays was in 2009. 

i phone 4 was released on 24th June 2010 and that was my second smartphone. So you see the way we live now and our online communications have evolved so far and so fast since Andrew disappeared. 

The people who were older around that time are able to identify with a pre 'online' world, but anyone who grew up seeing their parents online and has never known anything else will have a much harder time understanding that at one point more people were not online than regularly used it. 


I've also discovered from discussing other cases with people in the US, that they all seemed to have Internet and home computers waaaaay before the majority had them here. Even in a popular case from 1999 I've had people say that almost everyone was online at home and schools too, they chatted in chatrooms ect. That was definitely not the norm here in the UK as far back as 1999. 

Because the Internet generation was only just really taking off in the UK in 2007 even in the University, London Met, it was all paper resources and we had to queue up right down the corridors to submit assignments as hard copies. We could still even submit them as handwritten then too. Although most typed and printed it off, we didn't do it 'online'

Even when I went back to to University again in 2011 (Uni of Sheffield) it was still the same, but transitioning. Fast forward to 2020 & My 18 year old daughter cannot imagine anything other than accessing all her resources and submitting all her coursework online. 


However, Andrew had grown up without anything like what is normal by today's standards, so its definitely very likely he did not go online or have a presence. I'm sure at that time many his age and generation did, but it would have been just as normal to not. And definitely more difficult for an even younger generation, who have grown up with this technology all around them to actually comprehend. 

Therefore they apply their own experience to Andrew.

There are so many comments on here that say they used the Internet at this time without anyone knowing they did. Its possible he did somehow. Yet at the same time I believe its also possible that Andrew, as his parents say, really didn't have any interest in it.

conspiracytheories,fmy0exz,t1_fmvj07r,1586475499.0,"@hmolecke   I've read the MSN article again and there is nowhere in the article that states the family did not want a picture releasing of their son, or that a photo of someone else was used instead.

You cant just use a photo of a child who died (if that article is even true) 3 years ago on an article about another child's death.

The photograph that is on the top of the article is absolutely implying that child is the boy who died of this Covid-19.

Its a bogus article. To feed the propaganda and public fear and hysteria surrounding this so called coronavirus.

 So are the parents of the actual kid in the photo ( assuming that is even a picture of a real person) fine with their deceased child's photograph being used in article about another dead child?

Why would anyone do that?"

conspiracytheories,fmuygee,t1_fmuvad1,1586401728.0,"But is it really like or as bad and serious as what they reporting on the news ect? Because it just doesn't make sense a lot of it. Like here for example 
[UK Gov document](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/high-consequence-infectious-diseases-hcid)

'As of March 19th 2020 Covid-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease. And that the mortality rates were low overall.

So why is everything else in complete contrast to that statement?

These are death statistics that I've seen stating  deaths increased from previous years by around 500, I think it said that... the link is here [death stats UK](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales)


(I will use my town as an example) within less than a decade the population has increased here by over 200,000 people, so of course annually more people will die due to population growth. All the larger cities population has increased, so surely more people will die. How do we know everyone they say died of coronavirus really died of coronavirus? 

The UK Government statistics, before this virus, also stated that approximately 1400 die PER DAY in the UK. If that amount die in a day anyway in the UK, what about USA? Texas alone is three times bigger than UK and that's just one state!! 

What were those 1400 all dying of? No one talked about that. Now suddenly, for example 500 people die in a day and its attributed to Coronavirus. So, is that an additional 500 people to the 1400 who would have typically died in one day? Or it is within those estimates? 

Then there is obvious fake news like this. Who even knows if that photo is real when they have this technology [this person does not exist ](https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/)
 
With that in mind how do we know that the things they tell us is absolute fact?"

depression,fmuk2yp,t3_fxh4yf,1586392962.0,"I keep looking out from my kitchen window and thinking about things like that. Where I live its like being on bottom of a fish bowl. 

I was, supposed to move to another city but I stayed so my oldest could finish school and leave for uni. I had planned September, but now, ironically, everything is cancelled, exams and schools closed so could have gone. 

I'm not even sure we will be back to any sort of normal even by September. I don't see it and it makes me feel scared for the kids. Right now they are okay but I been laying in bed wondering what will happen if that doesn't go ahead as planned, then what? My oldest will be 19 and a prisoner in own house, just when she about to start out in the world on new adventures. 

I know it's the same for everyone, but its still a hard pill to swallow. 

I've had depression since I was 8. I worry about the kids if this just drags on and on. And I'm sure nothing will be the same. Not as before. A lot will change. And I don't think this will end any time soon. 

I've had disagreements on Facebook with friends because they really believe in a few weeks life will go back to the way it was before, but I know it won't. Could be years, and even then it won't be the same as before. 

I'm trying, because I know that maybe that's just their coping mechanisms kicking in, so they can deal with the right now. However, I'm just finding it so naieve that people actually think this can be over in a few weeks. 

My friend posted on fb yesterday her holiday in Portugal is cancelled for next week, and she saying she had no idea that would happen, but I don't see how? She's online everyday, sharing stuff about this Covid 19, Portugal is on full lockdown so it doesn't make sense to me that she really thought she was going next week? But I guess that's just how she's coping with it."

Please don't give me negative comments. Its something I don't understand, I just am curious to know how it works and why this lady didn't earn enough with job and welfare to pay even a cheap rent.
