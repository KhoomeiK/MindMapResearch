That would also bring me a lot of fear, and your concern is valid.

That being said, it is not and excuse... but, mental health can also take a village...He sounds sick. I have never been married but my ex and I were very much in love, and when he was depressed, he was another person. The same well intelligent, organized, engaging, handsome man who cared about himself and his self image wouldn‚Äôt shower for days, wouldnt do the dishes, make the bed, and was angry all the time. He couldn‚Äôt do anything. He would work, a very good and organized job mind you, but when he came home it was a different story. He would collapse and become withdrawn.

I find that you have to barter with people that have depression sometimes to get them to do things, like shower, or get up,and it is quite exhausting. I can‚Äôt imagine the stress that you‚Äôre dealing with during this time and coming home to that. I think I would feel resentful too. 

It sounds like your husband needs help, and of course you cannot make him get the help but I would have that convo on everything you need from him, how it‚Äôs making you feel and how exhausted you are, how much you love and value him and want him to get help, and it‚Äôs detrimental to your marriage that changes happen.

datingoverthirty,fotv4s2,t3_g9f30u,1588067228.0,"I may be providing an unconventional answer and will probably get heat for this but my honest thoughts. People with cluster B personality disorders never asked for them. Not everyone with ASPD is a serial killer. Most people who deal with personality disorders come from extremely abusive environments, a diagnosis is a set of symptoms regarding lack of coping skills. You can learn coping skills with behavioral therapy and many years of hard work. I don‚Äôt say that so you feel bad for him, I say that because it is not a choice for anyone to have to grow with a level of extreme pain. I was diagnosed with BPD in my early 30s and have survived a lifetime of extreme emotional, mental and physical abuse. It has been a long and lonely road and I don‚Äôt share much with others or stay close to people other then childhood friends because my relationships are too tumultuous. I don‚Äôt ask others for help when it comes to things I can do independently, and I do think I am worthy of love, now it just makes sense as to why I could never have healthy love. I think with a lot more work I am capable of being a good partner to someone someday when I‚Äôm ready. Right now I refuse to be romantic with anyone or date. When I was diagnosed all I found were a bunch of forums on how people hate BPDs, they are life ruiners and to run. I‚Äôm a person too and I want a stable and normal life as much as anyone.

You said he was diagnosed in his early 20s..how old is he? If he‚Äôs had time to digest it chances are he‚Äôs had time to put in the work, and if he has put in the work and CONTINUES to- understand that life will never fully be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù as it would be with a neurotypical partner but it is possible to have a healthy partnership with effort. Emphasis on *continues to*. Personality disorders are not a one time fix all. Therapy and behavior skills to a cluster B is like AA to an alcoholic, it‚Äôs constant work and it will never go away. His recovery has to be as important to him as wanting to live, otherwise there‚Äôs no chance this will work.  If he‚Äôs not working at it you need to be honest with yourself. This will never go away but it can be managed with education.

You are your first priority, not him. You need to look out for yourself and set strong boundaries. Love bombing is a huge red flag and all cluster B‚Äôs are pros at this. We don‚Äôt even realize we‚Äôre doing it. We genuinely want love, and we want to love. But it‚Äôs not sustainable. Getting high on love is the best feeling in the world for anyone but it‚Äôs not sustainable in the long run. Keep your wits about you. 

Continue to look for jobs, every single day - stay focused on your career and finding yourself back on your feet.

You‚Äôre living with a stranger you‚Äôre now romantic with and you do not have much independence. But the comeback is fully in your control. Focus on that. 

Keep those two things separate as much as you can and keep the lines drawn. You are living in this person‚Äôs house and yes they are doing a very nice thing for you, but don‚Äôt lose your footing- don‚Äôt let him being romantic take away from focusing on your independence. Do not get too comfortable here. Find work ASAP and get back on your feet. He‚Äôs doing you a favor but you don‚Äôt owe him a relationship for it. Keep those two things separate.

Aside from all this bs...If you genuinely like this person then realize they‚Äôre also a person ...and do regular shit you‚Äôd do with anyone else. Have fun, keep it light, exercise, hike, do the fun shit. Life is short, we all deserve to enjoy it. 

Be 100% honest with yourself. If something doesn‚Äôt feel right it‚Äôs because it isn‚Äôt, but if you feel this person is worth a shot it‚Äôs imperative you set strong boundaries and stay healthy. Learn as much as you can about this disorder, do your research, look at it from a clinical perspective. ASPs will struggle with love and emotions, but they can have an affinity for love and choose to act in ways that are beneficial for themselves and their partner. Is he generous in his community? Does he choose to be kind? Is he the same person in private as he is to the world?

Those are important things to consider.

Behavior is a choice, and since he is aware of his disorder he also gets to choose how he heals and continues to. Best of luck. Stay strong and stay educated.


Edit: OP, I just want to update my response in light of your update. I think the things he shared regarding his hurting animals as a teenager (not a small child) and the fact he‚Äôs in therapy just to ‚Äúkeep out of trouble‚Äù is extremely worrisome. Please consider your safety and the real risk of his unpredictability knowing this. You also indicated that he never committed violent crimes, followed with an update that he hurt animals which yes, is a violent crime. How can a person like that be caring? It is one thing as a small child with high impulses, it‚Äôs another as a grown person. 

Knowing this, with the fact that he ‚Äúusually‚Äù goes to therapy twice and week is also worrisome, which I did not touch one before I apologize.

DOES he *actually* go or *usually* go? Those are two different things and which leaves a lot of wiggle room for lies. 

He became a Dr. to ‚Äúincrease his earning potential‚Äù so he thought it would increase the chance of his problems away? That is just... delusional. That just gives him more options to keep people around him under his control. The fact that you also learned this AFTER you had sex with him and not before tells me he‚Äôs even more manipulative and dangerous then initially given. 

Look at it this way...If someone asked you this question and provided you with the same knowledge you‚Äôre giving us, what would your real response be? You need to be honest with yourself without the bullshit.

It sounds like you‚Äôre seeking validation from this community to affirm choices you‚Äôre already set on making. Sounds like you have enough insight and info to know what the logical thing to do is. Do you have friends or family you can contact to stay with? If so, I would consider going to stay with them.. perhaps don‚Äôt give him any indication you‚Äôre leaving, where you‚Äôre going, and leave when he‚Äôs not home."

BPD,ffx3dvo,t1_ffwzlbv,1580316894.0,"Thank you for this. I find that people who deal with emotional issues tend to find the same hiding places, maybe that is your case... that can be a fine line to walk - it‚Äôs either wonderful or a dangerous thing. It‚Äôs more manageable with friends I think then partners since boundaries are more an issue with intimacy, at least for me. If I see action and consistency it doesn‚Äôt matter how broken someone is as long as they are contributing members of society and treat people with respect. 

I really don‚Äôt think it is a bad thing when people are actively working on themselves and gravitate towards others who have similar demons. I‚Äôm trying to be mindful of that in partnerships but also be open to the possibility of knowing that just because someone hasn‚Äôt experienced my trauma doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt be patient, so I‚Äôm hoping to find someone on that level. How else can you really understand someone without resonating with them, you know? It‚Äôs a lot.  I have a lot to offer people around me, I try to be a voice of support and kindness - so if that draws people with issues,  I‚Äôll work on that boundary - but when people are trying I think that‚Äôs a beautiful thing.

BPD,ffvakfw,t1_ffva2c8,1580259587.0,"I feel that I do. I‚Äôve noticed though normal is relative as cliche as it sounds. Once I stopped smoking I basically kind of faded from peoples lives. Ive refocused my time with the gym and guitar lessons, writing a lot- I use to do all of those things stoned so I thought I had to but now I just focus on doing them in kind of a meditative focused way. I‚Äôve found that weed is kind of overrated for me at this time but it was a friend for so long lol. So your relationship can simply change with it. I would still choose weed/CBD/hemp as medicine over any synthetic for physical pain. It could just be right now."
BPD,ffv9swg,t3_evdvnb,1580259077.0,"Before I was diagnosed I thought it was helping me with depression but I also spent a lot of time in my head thinking it was normal to be obsessive in my thoughts... once I was diagnosed and realized how much time I needed to put into therapy and working thru everyday emotions so I could STOP swinging, it started to make me paranoid which I found weird because I smoked everyday. I love weed but now when I smoke I feel unproductive,paranoid and I feel it takes away from my progress. This is just me though."

relationship_advice,few1sl4,t1_fevyv2n,1579404275.0,That is the worst. It is hard to tell what goes on in other people‚Äôs lives/marriages.  You sound like a good friend and whatever is going on in her world has nothing to do with you. I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this.
relationship_advice,fevy1z6,t3_eqqiim,1579402982.0,"Anytime. She very well could be. I only say borderline personality because you mentioned blurred boundaries. Borderlines struggle with all boundaries. They can also be the kindest, most charismatic, doting and exhilarating friends to have - it is difficult and exhausting to maintain healthy relationships with these kinds of friends unless you have clear boundaries too as their self image can shift drastically and sometimes seemingly confusing and unpredictable behaviors will follow.  If she is dealing with this, she probably feels a lot of guilt for her behavior too. So just be mindful that her behavior is not a reflection of you as a person in any way. Be patient, make other friends, let her know you understand and you‚Äôre there for her if she needs anything. Mental and emotional illness does not make sense and is confusing for anyone who doesn‚Äôt know what signs to look for."
relationship_advice,fevvr0e,t3_eqqiim,1579402031.0,"She sounds like she has Borderline or manic type behaviors. She probably really did/does enjoy your company and couldn‚Äôt sustain the speed in which your friendship was going. Borderlines tend to want to make others feel welcome and included, they are empathetic and welcoming, and bond quickly with people, it is all encompassing but it is not sustainable when real life kicks back in and the high wears off. It is blinding for people who don‚Äôt understand the shift. It is possible that she stepped away from her responsibility and couldn‚Äôt balance her life and this new friendship. This is not a reflection of you whatsoever. It sounds like she has her own issues. So it is confusing when things go from day to night. BPD‚Äôs also have a tendency to create heartache unintentionally when their masks come off. I say this as someone whose exhibited and struggled with these behaviors and has done damage without meaning to. She probably really does enjoy your company and this has nothing to do with you. Her husband could just be immune to her behavior and supporting her, hence being in a good mood and riding it out. You never know what goes on behind closed doors with people. Your friend probably does struggle with some level of mental / emotional health and that would be confusing for anyone when they are blindsided by it. Just my two cents."

I struggle with boundaries but I am working on being better, it is hard for me because I‚Äôve had friends who have had better boundaries basically tell me I‚Äôm getting taken advantage of and I didn‚Äôt see it.

Those were also the first people to cut me off in my craziness because of my lack of. Being a human sucks sometimes."

datingoverthirty,fdiv0j2,t1_fde8c5r,1578451655.0,"This very much sounds like love bombing. As someone recently diagnosed with BPD who didn‚Äôt know I had it, I did this in my last relationship and the ending hurt like a mother fucker. I did not know half the shit I was doing was actually what it was.

Sounds like the beginning of a BPD love. Not to say she couldn‚Äôt be sincere, she probably is a very nice person but too much too soon is usually too much. Slow it down, stay friends from a distance. In time if you feel the same and you continue to be friendly, and she shows *consistency* then maybe it‚Äôs real. Time will tell. 

Personally I would not be okay with someone openly hooking up with other people when I wanted a relationship. 

If you enjoy her company be her friend from far. Don‚Äôt fall in love with a mirage. Sorry to sound cynical. You probably are an amazing dude, and the moments you shared were very real, just don‚Äôt hitch your horse to that wagon if it‚Äôs too good to be true. It usually is. People who love bomb aren‚Äôt healthy. They‚Äôre attached. There is a difference."

BPD,fdclumo,t3_eki3rt,1578278123.0,"I think this is where animals really help. Honestly. 

The need and asking for it, it‚Äôs valid and it is just that, a need. But not everyone can meet your needs, and it seems insurmountable to make someone happy all the time. As an outsider looking in, looking in from a potential NT perspective; sometimes it can be a lot on another person when they don‚Äôt know how to help someone whose emotional needs seem like a bottomless well, not a lot of people get it. Animals don‚Äôt have that. They just love you. 

I say this with love. BPD is a selfish beast.. The person itself can be the most selfless and loving person, and most actually are. Hang in there.

relationship_advice,fd7k6x3,t3_ejp970,1578205778.0,"I am so sorry for your losses. It sounds like an incredibly tough place to be and my heart goes to you. The stages before death do not always make sense, if she is on a sedative it is very likely that a small innocent passing crush on your brother when he was alive somehow mixed with her guilt of leaving you caused her to create a non existent scenario. It may or may not be the case but it's just a thought. When my Mother was passing and on morphine she told me I was pregnant with twins, I have never been pregnant nor was I. The brain will do some crazy shit .. when we are seeing a loved one die we want to trust that what they're saying is the truth since we're losing time and we're clinging on to whatever is left. Don't overthink it if you can, maybe speak with a nurse if there is one? The hospice nurses at the hospital where my Mom passed were incredible. Hang in there, you're doing the right thing. Honor the best in both of you and cherish the minutes with no judgement <3 xo"

BPD,fctb45r,t3_eiqkwu,1577937801.0,"No. I‚Äôm 33 and feel like as hard as it can be and as much as it seems like an uphill battle my best are yet to come. It makes sense not why everything hurts so bad and now I have a chance to fix it. Never had a normal childhood or even one at all. Now I can have a more normal future and hopefully bring a stable family into this world. It‚Äôs still hard, I fight to live everyday.

You‚Äôre 19, and that doesn‚Äôt undermine any of your pain. It hurts and it‚Äôs real. I have hope for you. It‚Äôs gonna hurt like hell but your best years can be yet to come. I hope you find the support and love that you need. It is scary putting yourself out there. I hope you have a good therapist and can find good grounding skills. üíú sending you love"
BPD,fblilb7,t3_edt6bi,1576963433.0,"Good job on not engaging on the compulsions!!!!! That is huge!! I know how hard that is.üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª

Hang in there. You‚Äôll go through all the motions.. questioning, denying, contemplating, accepting- It is hard everyday. Dbt and mindfulness helps. Find a therapist as soon as you can. You‚Äôre not your diagnoses. It‚Äôs a part of you, and it comes in many forms for many people. No one size fits all and it does get better. It is a mindfuck for your moods to change every 14 seconds. 

I listen to meditation songs on Spotify and videos on youtube multiple times a day. That helps a lot, I recommend it. 

here‚Äôs the thing... you can feel a certain way, and act a different way. So you can hate yourself and want to be impulsive, but fight the urge, speak slower, take a deep breath, and try to speak to your friend calmly instead of pushing them away. The hard thing is, is wanting people to understand and they don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve found more support on Reddit then anywhere.

That is not being a fraud, that is self preservation and a hard concept to grasp when you have a cognitive disorder. Pushing people away is something you will do, but, you recognize it - so, if you can, remove yourself for a second and try to see it from another set of eyes. If you only have a few days with your friend, try to enjoy it- and if you can‚Äôt, at the very least, don‚Äôt push it away and even if it is hard to believe just know this person loves you and wants your company. Sending you love homie."
