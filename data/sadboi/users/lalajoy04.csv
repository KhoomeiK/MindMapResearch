If he fakes having to nap he doesn’t get it later if he really needs a nap. Once a day is all I do. We’re set to stop when he turns 4 in a week. I’ve been tandem nursing for 20 months, so I’ve been where you are! At that stage we talked a lot about how babies drink milk and don’t eat food (and then when he started solids, not as much food). Now if he says he wants to nurse when his brother gets it (he still nurses 3-4 times a day) I just say “He nurses more because he’s a baby.” Just keep reiterating that and she’ll get it.
