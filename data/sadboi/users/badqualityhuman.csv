I just wanted to say ""hi"" real quick and then take the next bus. 

He stood there alone and made me feel guilty for leaving, so I decided I'll have a drink and then go. When the time had come I said that I wanted to go. He made me feel guilty again and said he wanted to drive me home. So I said ok. So I stayed. He always asked me how my love-life is going (I was dating my now boyfriend at that time) so I told him about that. 

After that day, he wrote me often. He was a friend of my coworker, when I went to work the next day, she told me how happy she was that I was dating this guy. I had to explain her, that it wasn't a date and that I dated another guy. He really told everyone we had a date. Which wasn't true. Ahhh it was just such an awkward meet up."
