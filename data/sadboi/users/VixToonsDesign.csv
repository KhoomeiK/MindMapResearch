politics,fr0d36c,t1_fr0b27s,1589791343.0,"Isn't it kind of the same everywhere? Or maybe not... Irish here but we don't get to directly elect who our Taoiseach is (aka Prime Minister aka the one who runs the country). We don't get a say on who that individual is.

In fact, pre Covid we had a vote which saw left leaning parties take the majority of votes which was very exciting. It looked like our usual 2 party power politics were about to get disrupted for once and then Covid came and priorities shifted I guess? So now it looks like the party who ultimately got the highest percentage of votes will not gain any power and instead the same two, unpopular, parties will remain pulling all the strings.

Im not great for talking politics and I'm sure someone far more educated on matters would do a better job than me but my point is, politics is corrupt everywhere and if you think people actually have a proper say, you're likely wrong.

Mind is within the self, as someone who spent years upon years in the depths of absolute self hatred. Happy is a simplistic goal, it's contentment for me. I've never had it and it's all I want. It's a peace of mind, it's something that evaded me for my whole life. It's simple and joyful. It's what it means to me."
LifeProTips,fq0nm9y,t1_fpznk2m,1589034789.0,No I don't believe so. Sadness is inevitable in life but if you have a sense of happiness that stems from self worth then you are better able to be kind to yourself in times or hardship or sadness.

Not from or in America but there's a bitter taste around certain folks there and they're blatant continued racism. You just know *some* Americans, the slack jawed types, would be more than happy to return to the days when they could treat non white people however the fuck they want. They're the same ones who'd want to be able to treat women however the fuck they like.

Lunch might be prawns with veg and a small amount of brown rice or something.

3pm snack of either greek yoghurt and fruit or crisp breads with peanut butter.

Dinner I'll have a vegan protein shake first usually with blueberries and avocado. Then I'll make some chicken with veg or beans or something. I'll work out after and finish off my shake after that.

Then I usually get peckish again and I'll try stick to apple with peanut butter or turkey slices or something but I crave cereal!!"

Anyway, it's just a note re your comment on him having no interest in make up, he's so into it, though more relaxed than his current YouTube persona.

I think his interest in make up actually is genuine but that's just my 2 cents. Naturally he'd have an interest in making money too, he's a marketer and business person."

What's worse is if I lean forward.. they look awful.

He gave me a cert for the week and advised I just take the pressure off a bit. Lie on the couch, watch a movie and just let myself relax at times. 

I think this whole thing kept me on edge like I had to stay doing stuff and eventually my whole body just went NOPE!

ireland,fmz8nhl,t1_fmz6dm6,1586510753.0,"Trust me, I've had depression. I'm not trying to have a go here but maybe you're misinterpreting my post.

I'm up every day, I'm doing stuff and even if I feel a bit zapped I'm going ahead and doing stuff.

I just am very wary of diagnosing depression on people. Depression is a very serious condition of hopelessness. If you keep telling someone they have depression you risk them just throwing up their hands and going ""guess I'm depressed"" which in itself can lead to a spiral into depression.

In the meantime I'm going to try some DIY treatments and see can I help it.

I'll let you know if I get anywhere positive."

I spoke to one guy who said he just gets blanket emails, calls and texts and they don't even know where the place is, they just hound it as soon as something appears online."
