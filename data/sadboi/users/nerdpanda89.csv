Depending how its worded it could potentially be low-key bullying the bully, which is arguably just as bad as the initial bullying since everyone has presumably had time to mature.  I totally resonate with OP's feelings and desire to be heard, but I think you're on the right track suggesting writing ABOUT it (and not sending) rather than writing a message to send.

Or, OP, if you want to be heard, maybe consider posting on r/unsentletters so you can still put your feelings out there, just not in such a personal manner.

I'm not sure what your intention behind messaging them would be though.  Are you hoping for an apology, or to make them feel bad?  I'm afraid you will likely be disappointed with their responses, if they reply at all.  Most people don't like to be called out for their mistakes, or will brush it off as something they did when they were ""young and dumb"", you would have to be VERY careful how you worded your message to get a positive response I think.

Delete them, and just continue living the best life you can.  Meet new people who appreciate you, and keep some kind of standard for how you allow people to treat you.  It's ok to verbalize boundaries to current friends if they cross a line, but rehashing stuff from the past usually won't do much good unless you genuinely want to re-establish a positive relationship with them going forward.

Can you hide books in your room?

He found that understanding the science behind how/why he reacts has helped him catch himself in a spiral, and it's made me a lot more understanding of his behavior.  
If you find that book (or anything else backed by science) helpful I'd maybe suggest having your mother read it as well, it's a lot tougher to write it off as nonsense when the evidence is staring you in the face, especially if she is aware of the trauma that put you in your current state.
