TopMindsOfReddit,fqxndxv,t1_fqxl90g,1589734980.0,"I think there’s a lot more to it than that. The vast major of people develop political leanings as a result of their environment. This is true of the left and right. I’ve lived and worked near rural towns where many people came from. Being conservative is the default way to think, and a lot of people born into it know no other way. If you’re not exposed to other ideas or taught to think critically, those beliefs become cemented. So for some people, it has nothing to do with empathy (on the other hand if you’re super rich or looking to benefit from GOP politics, some might flock to this—i believe you already touches on that). People turn off their empathy when it suits them or to avoid challenging their world view, but you don’t become a conservative because of this. It just so happens continually supporting conservative actions *does* require someone to do this. 

The sad truth is there are people who do well by themselves and their community. They raise families, do their best to teach their kids right and wrong, and are manipulated into voting against their best interests. Voting conservative is a way to preserve their way of life, and they don’t realize that you can do that under a liberal government."

My father's erratic behavior as a kid was incredibly disruptive and took a major toll on my mother and I. His substance abuse problems only exacerbated it, but I never understood the root of his mental illness (he was diagnosed as type I) until I received my own diagnosis and began to understand my own abuse with drugs and alcohol. Even though he was mentally explosive and irresponsible to a scarring extent, he fought hard so that I could be educated and have a better life. He's not doing great these days; business is slowing and his health is failing, and I'm afraid one day soon he will be gone. I just wish he had sought treatment before 30 years of things spiraled out of control. The best we can do is live our lives better and follow where we wish they had. I know that's what my father wants me of me--to become what he wanted for himself--and I'm sure yours was the same way."
