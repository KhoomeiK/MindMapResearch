My mother catch the Covid 3 weeks ago and quarantine herself in her bedroom, but this 3 weeks are a real nightmare, because, first, i don't really want that shit and second, with a cirrhosis of the liver if i get it I'll die for sure.
So everytime i need to get out of my bedroom for food or stuff, i touch just what i really need to touch and after that, WASHING MY HANDS LIKE MAD. Don't touch your face, eyes etc and that's ok. Just wash your hands carefully everytime. Think of that like...i don't know, a barrier? Because that's the case trust me.

Theses last day i give less f***, it's my new routine, getting used to washing my hands carefully, and telling myself ""and if i die, so what ?""

Maybe because I'm bored or tired...the only thing that continue to make me anxious? The outside. I CAN'T go outside. Literally. 

Everyone is different and the brain can make you a real slave of your fears. You need to be smart, protecting yourself and saying to your mind ""Shut up. I can take care of myself and i have 00,1% chances to grab this shit. I have more chances to win playing lottery if i know what to do against the virus.""

>Washing hands, washing stuff you have buying if possible, that's  the way. At least you don't do stupids things, no reasons to stress ;)"
covidandme,fqwxvvy,t3_gh9v3z,1589720848.0,"More or less 15 years in quarantine here (liver disease so.) And with the time i realized that i have some little depression at the beginning. You know, waking up and asking yourself ""What can i do? This day is the same as yesterday and surely tomorrow.""

And...with time you get used to that, you construct a new normality and a new routine, maybe that's not the best, maybe you'll need to try to discovers some news things etc...being in quarantine is like a Yo-yo, up and down constantly. My mood can change 10 times a day.

If i have an advice -and trust me that's the way to not being depressed- kick your ass and do stuff. You don't want to do what you like anymore? Try at least. Your mind need to be focus on some good things. If you let your brain get in the ""I'm in a deep shit"" zone for too long, you'll be more and more depressed and more and more anxious, doing nothing.

Good luck, hope you will get better soon."

Crafting one by one. 2minutes when someone traveling to an island and quit, the little loading when you pass in terraforming mode on/off can get on your nerves if you forget one hole or anything, impossibly to do something when someone is on your island or if your doors are open etc)

Really, after more than 400 hours on the game, I'm half assed between getting used of all this stuff and depression. I don't ask anything, just little updates here and here to correct some things for making the game more comfortable. No big deal. And seriously, the game is a battery eater.

And after 15 years in a Dark bedroom, that was a shock. You know...all the things that i know back then are finally here. Peoples, shops, funs, fresh air and stuff. Amazing seriously. And after a mouth outside, in Japan, when the time as come to travel back in my room, i just wanted to die, litteraly.

It's the same case here. You get used of a situation, you forget about...a lot of stuff and you fear that all this fun or freedom will never happen again. Tomorrow or in 3/4 years. That's a normal fear in this dark era, but everything has an end and human can get used -usually- to a new normality with time.

But the first chock is like a slap in the face and : Panic.

Hope i can explain the situation more or less clearly because English is not my native language so...

That's when YOUR World change radically. Your brain is at lost, everything seems weird/strange. And then one day, what you seeing as strange today will be the new routine. Not an easy path, i must admit nor a great moment, but...we need to deal with it. Maybe It's time to discover some others things, focus on yourself, and coming to go outside little by little. (I'm against the ""go outside"" advice in Covid pandemic, but some need to. And with safety that's ok.)

Sorry for the shitty poat, its very complicated to deal with this situation because everyone is different, personally, i don't have the balls to take a feet outside since 2019...bad timing, just when i got hyped by the outside again with not so much panic attacks.

China_Flu,fq2cv7e,t1_fq0qux4,1589054924.0,"Exactly that. In fact i joined China_Flu at first because they don't censors stuff, and you can say what you think without being ban for no real reasons.

But you described pretty well the new face of the sub. Now you will not be banned, like always, but the freedom of speech is punished by downvotes if you are mad after some racist who want us to hates all the Chineses in the World.

They need a brain, Asap. Each time i get downvoted, i imagine the Redneck cliches, really mad about tolerance and intelligence. Doesn't need some press articles to prove that the vast majority here are some dicks. 

Miss the time when everyone are mad about the right things, CCP and the WHO especially. Not just some fakes articles about Chineses."

The most important thing is that they still with us, even in a game. 

That's why i love personal island. It's always a part of ours lifes and personality. Hard times and good memories still with us."
AnimalCrossingNewHor,fpzswiq,t3_ggdodj,1589023115.0,"Hi ! Yesterday I've traveled to my fiancee Island to paying respect for ours lovely passed away dogs, and then, the Sky starting to shooting stars. That's dumb i know, and i never post pics about animal crossing on reddit but...this time i got pretty emotional. That's amazing how the Sky can talk without words. At least, that's what i like to think.

Just an anecdote, nothing big, but this game can be more than a game sometimes.

Have a nice day community!"
China_Flu,fpzqp1p,t1_fpyc3v8,1589022111.0,"Masks are a good protection, but nothing big. As someone who's getting in Japan last year, wearing a mask everyday, I've got a ""Strange pneumonia"" that was hell. Seriously. 
That's not a magical solution or anything. It's more safe with everyone wearing it (especially in closed space like metro.) But...your eyes are free to catch a lot of things.

So yeah, I'm 100% for the mazk culture in the West like in japan, no doubt about this. But the traitor thing are a little too much and....Chinese."
