>I am more sympathetic than some to the protesters, and others, who want  to see states reopen, who believe the cost of lockdown overwhelms the  apparent benefits. The economic agony is real, and they have been given  no way to imagine its end, no clear understanding of the purpose behind  their sacrifice. But the awful choice they feel we face — between  endless lockdown or reckless reopening — needs to be understood for what  it is: the failure of our political leaders to create a safer, middle  path.

Geothermal Heat Pump (GHP) or Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) are the using the constant temperature of the ground to heat your house.    You keep using Geothermal when you mean GHP.  To further confuse things, there are also Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHP).   And finally, there are ""earth tubes"" which just precondition the air up to the constant temperature of the ground.  So 3 very similar technologies -- easy to get confused and also easy to get the wrong google search terms (I prefer GSHP instead of GHP).

If you are willing to live in a cave-like temperature environment and have the space, then earth tubes are super cheap and super energy efficient (pumps can be pretty efficient).  Of course, if you want to have things closer to 72 degrees F, then you have to do something more like passive solar.

1.  Is the antibody tests sufficiently accurate for determining whether you have had it?
2. Can you test positive for antibodies (accurately) and still get sick later? or the equivalent question:  Can you have antibodies, but not yet be immune?
3. Can you be immune, and yet still test positive for active cultures in your nasal passages?  (i.e., can you be immune but still be a carrier?)
4. Are the tests from nasal swabs of people who test positive for antibodies but yet also test positive for COVID-19 due to the presence of dead viruses? (parents point)

The original post is saying that #2 is yes, but I do think this is unlikely -- the ideasthat you have antibodies but not have at least partial immunity is a statement that one of the major immune system's defenses becomes ineffective for COVID-19.  This really doesn't seem possible.   Thankfully, because if this were true then we have no hope for a vaccine or herd immunity.

Since others are not, I will suggest finding a psychiatrist with experience in PTSD symptoms.  Sertraline (Prozac) is helpful, as well as an antipsychotic if dissociation is a really big issue.  Caveats apply to both which is why you need a good psychiatrist (and even then, they are not cures, but rather just crutches to help you get by until time and therapy can kick in.

Most relevant however is Prazosin which gets rid of the night terrors/nightmares in many people.  This is somewhat controversial because ""dreams are a form of free therapy"", but in the experience with my daughter (who luckily is responsive), if the night terrors are too bad, then anxiety develops around sleep, and that anxiety interferes with sleep.  This can cause huge issues and warrant Prazosin.

What had ended up working for us is using Prazosin when you have spells of excessive nightmares/night terrors.  A couple of weeks of it, and then slowly taper off to where you don't remember the dreams.  We've had this to get us through around 3 spells of bad dreams over the past year.

David Frum, a Republican (GWB speechwriter) but a Never-Trumper, wrote a book in the 90's warning of Gingrich-ism.  His basic point is that the old racist Southern Democrats from the 50s and 60s were taking over the Republican party:  Gingrich, Lott, Thurmond, etc. were hijacking Reagan's message just for political power and not because they were truly conservative.  Prescient, but in the end, power won.
