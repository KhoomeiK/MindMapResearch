CPTSD,f38azq0,t3_dg2d2o,1570735023.0,"Sorry you're going through so much pain and fear. I've definitely been there- and lack of responses from my ex fiance/his absence would drive me insane when I had episodes, to the point of self harm. 

A lot of people don't know how painful perceived abandonment is. Every second passes so slowly and the world spirals out of control, heart hurting like someone has a tight fist on it, all the while being bombarded with messages like ""you have to love yourself! You don't need anyone."" While that's a beautiful end goal, when you're suffering in the bottom of the pit it just sounds like a load of BS. 

What continues to help me is having a robust support network to disperse the weight of helping someone with their pain. I'd mass blast ""hey are you free to text/chat a little? I'm having a hard time right now..."" to my close friends. Coming to r/CPTSD has definitely been a major one for me. And talking to you guys. 

Before, I put all the weight of my mental illness onto my ex and he couldn't take it anymore. He didn't blame me, just my illness, but ""taking care"" of me was just too overbearing, so he left after 3 years of being by my side. It really shattered me and I hope that never happens to you.

Fast forward to now. Distributing my pain among several friends have helped me actually keep my friendships and current relationship with bf strong. Friends feel closer to me (and open up more too, since I did) and my bf has more space to take care of himself too. 

I wish you the best. It hurts so much and I'm sorry."

I think it's really a miscommunication barrier. You got him something you definitely enjoy, and thought he would enjoy when you are apart, and thought would make sex better, but he took it the wrong way. 

It may have been an inconsiderate gift but I don't think that makes you TA. He could've responded that he felt weird/insulted in a much more considerate way towards your good intentions. You even customized it. If anything I think that makes him TA more than you.

If my bf (super low libido, we don't do it much unfortunately) got me a custom dildo for Christmas tbh I'd be weirded out and feel sad. But I can see how he would have the same intentions, that he wants me to enjoy good dicking even when he's not feeling it, but I wouldn't be into it especially without him. I think I'd communicate that I feel a little insulted and sad but it's not his fault and we can return it for something we both find fun.

It's already good that you know what you wanted back then but was told ""no""- if you can, try and give them a little try again. Social media algorithms actually kind of helped too. I never wore makeup and nail polish but I noticed on my YouTube, I kept watching tutorials anyway without even realizing it. Or ads in my Instagram feed.

AskReddit,eut1kad,t3_chaf53,1564017933.0,"Seriously speaking, it's good to have a mental checklist on what matters to you. After a lot of hoeing around (55 first dates in a 6 month span) I had a literal list and now I'm digging up my Excel file for you. Everyone is special and no one really is, at the same time. It's all about compatibility and chemistry. 

For me, it was essential for the other person to be open minded, considerate towards me, be compassionate, and be ambitious. These took up 50% of their composite score.

The other half was ""good to haves but not essential"". For me, those were passions for active learning, the arts, travel, philanthropy, food, drinking, drugs, gaming, technology, health and fitness, mental health, and common culture. 

Few things to keep in mind: 
1. Stay open. Try guiding to the topics on the first date but don't force it. It's normal to not get many answers. It's also normal that the other person comes up with something that surprises you that you didn't know about, whether it would be good or bad.

2. Give people a chance. If they're hitting some of your criteria on the first date even if it sucked it's worth trying to go out again. 

3. Uncontrollable chemistry factor

I met the sweetest people who had high scores in Essentials but no Good to Haves and there was just really nothing we had in common, and as for the other way around, we could have a good time but that was it. A select few scored high in both but we just didn't have chemistry, but we turned out to be good friends.

Currently in a serious relationship with my 55th first date for 223 days and our first date sucked. 4/10 on both ends when we first met 283 days ago, but we hit each other's criteria partially in one way or another, so we gave it another shot and it's one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life.

There are so many parts of me that are broken that nobody can truly help me heal. But I found the human connection essential to my healing because the loneliness was unbearable. ""You have to love yourself"" felt like an impossible task when I was hurting that much. 

---

Three things that really helped me:
1. ""Spreading it out."" With current and/or new friends. I noticed that I could give more empathy when a person didn't rely on me for emotional support, and vice versa. For example, I told one friend I hurt myself, another friend about dissociation, and even a group of strangers that I got cheated on and was lonely ever since, and that's all I shared about my CPTSD side with each group respectively. And of course, appreciate their attention and worry, and be there when they want to talk too to the best of your ability. 

2. Cradling my giant teddy bear. I'm 26 and this sounds ridiculous and pathetic but I'd hug it really hard and pretend it's someone else's arm. There's a certain feeling of a soft and firm weight on my heart that helps me take deeper breaths. I'd put it on my lap when I'm on my computer and hug it when I sleep. I feel like it ""simulates"" connection, and plus my bear is hella cute. Give it a try, y'all. It's embarrassing in the beginning but when you get over that, damn it feels good. To give connection to myself and feel just a teeny bit less reliant on others. No spoilers, but I was really inspired by the new toy story  movie.

3. Coming to this sub to post, comment, read, and upvote. We may not be able to see each other irl but it's so nice to know that so many people fully understand my pain. I feel like you can't see my body but you can see my soul. This sub and you all have helped me in ways I can't even begin to describe.

It shifted my perspective so much in ways good and bad, but overall, I came back from the experiences completely mindblown at the spectrum of how us humans are capable of feeling and thinking. My mental illness makes me believe that there is no light at the end of the tunnel/maybe I'll just die. LSD wasn't a magic tab that ""fixed anything"" but it made me broaden my perspective to many more possibilities. I would suggest the following for your first time:

1. If you're not ready, don't do it or the fear will make you miserable. That includes ""coping"" with shitty feelings by trying it. This is not that kind of drug and it's a terrible idea to cope with substances anyways (speaking from a substance abuser...)

2. Quality control. Make sure you're getting something from a trustworthy source and not from someone you don't know. 

3. Be in a safe space. Be with someone who you trust. It's even better if they're experienced, whether they've done it before or they've taken care of a tripping friend.

4. Prepare water and something to write/type with. You will learn a lot about how you see yourself and your life. Jot it down and read again when you're done tripping.

5. Prepare other stuff that makes you happy and calm, like plushies, videos etc. 

6. Really, it's a ""trip"" with potential ups and downs of eye opening moments so that's what you should expect. I had moments of anxiety, cold sweats, and my favorite ramen tasting like shit. But I also had hours of saturated colors of objects and lights, people smiling in slow motion, sensing their auras of happiness, and being reminded of how the world can be a brilliant, infinite playground like the moments when I was a ""cute enough kid"" that was loved before I got abused.

CPTSD,esnqq87,t1_esnmacl,1562145263.0,"Same for me actually. Wasn't physical abuse but the extreme neglect, emotional abuse and impossible expectations. 

How my grandpa treated my dad is still a mystery to me (only heard from my sister 8 years older who witnessed everything) that he was a complete neglectful, abusive asshole who treated literally everyone else with kindness"
CPTSD,esnqmc4,t1_esnkkad,1562145093.0,"Being slapped sounds fucking horrible. I think yeah regardless of how much it physically hurt it's so loaded with emotional undermining too. Agree on the return it to my ancestors part, wow what a family curse that asshole put on the rest of us"

TooAfraidToAsk,es27gdc,t1_es1dw20,1561515939.0,"I'd like to add on to this: they are all on spectrums too- so that includes the ""gray areas"". I can't say for them what end they would be on, but here is an example profiles of a person who MIGHT identify as all three:

""Joyce is born a girl and is attracted to women. Their gender expression is ambiguous and don't really identify with most ""stereotypical and traditional girly aspects"". In fact, they have very short hair, binds down their chest with a Spandex-like cloth, and never wears makeup. They love wearing baggy shirts and cargo shorts but occasionally a skirt. But they don't really identify with ""stereotypical and traditional guy-like aspects"" either. Finally, they're not really into sex. They can bang once in a while when their partner wants, but Joyce is not that interested in banging and would rather do something else in all opportunities to bang.""

-You can like women only but not dress like Joyce.
-You can express your attire like Joyce but still identify as a woman and not non-binary. 
-You can also rarely bang but not identify as asexual.

Basically, you may identify with other labels. 

Eg. Just because you're a guy who likes girly attire and talk about what guys you think are good looking doesn't mean you identify as female or identify as gay.

People might argue about your ""extent of lesbian-ness, non-binary level, and how much you're really into banging to 'qualify' as asexual"". People might be really sarcastic and mean. 

I think it helps you understand when you try to label YOURSELF when you understand the terms. 

TL;DR: They're all on spectrums and it's really about what you identify with when you truly know the meanings of these words and not be a sarcastic meanie like many people are. Also, EVERYTHING DEPENDS.
