depression,fg2zzky,t1_fg2xsxf,1580463789.0,"Thankyou so much!!! I'll keep that in mind. And she's improving a lot, in terms of mental health. And I feel like this relationship is helping her to see the better version of herself and life, in general. She seems to be more comfortable expressing her feelings now than ever before. And she knows I'll always listen to her and I'll always have her back. But also I know when to give her space when she's not feeling like it. I'm positive that she's gonna be better.
And I'm very grateful for the help :)"

depression,fg2w1mc,t1_fg2vuoz,1580458356.0,"Ah I get you. But I've dealt with online friends and others who have had mental illness. One of my bestfriends has it and we've been helping her for over a year. So I understand mental illness for the most part, just that I don't have it myself. And since I'm from India where 90% of the population doesn't understand mental illness, I'd say I understand it enough to be able to help her. I jus wanna help her that's it. Also, my girlfriend has gotten A LOT better than before. Things are positive :)
I jus wrote this article to know if there's stuff I can do to make her feel better :)"
