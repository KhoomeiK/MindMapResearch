femalehairadvice,f1fnzol,t3_d984wt,1569448763.0,I love the way that shampoo makes my hair feel! I have also had pretty good results with the Pantene Pro-V Sheer Volume. I feel like it does a really good job of cleansing my scalp.

seriouseats,etl6cja,t1_etkvzr4,1562923889.0,"I’ve only ever used cast iron- either a grill pan or skillet. I find that you get more even browning and less issues with sticking when using a skillet. Other than that, I haven’t notice much difference."
