WomensHealth,fpy8myt,t1_fpx9qdb,1588998465.0,"It could be anxiety. For like ten years now I’ve had what I call “pee anxiety” where I HAVE to pee right before bed, sometimes get up to go again before I fall asleep or in the middle of the night. There’s been periods in my life where I was getting up 10 times a night. It feels like there’s pressure in my bladder and I have to pee, but only a few drops come out (If you’re actually peeing a lot each time then it might not be anxiety tho - anxiety can make you feel like you have to pee but I don’t think it can actually produce more urine) . Part of it is the anxiety of peeing the bed, I think maybe part of it is just so built into me at this point. 

It sucked a lot at times but being on top of my sleep hygiene and mental health makes it so I only get up once or twice at most every night which is fine by me. I’ve also been able to figure out how to self soothe so I don’t feel the need to go as much, thoughts like “you don’t have to actually pee it’s just your mind”, “eh screw it try to sleep another min and if you can’t then go pee” (then I fall asleep), “you won’t wet the bed you never do, and you can go pee whenever you want” if I really think I need it lol. But yeah pee anxiety especially before bed is a thing"

AskReddit,fowwvmo,t1_fowri0c,1588128895.0,"I get the appeal of having an extra free day but I don’t think most of these things would be improved with this schedule. Yes I get one day off commuting, but I would have less time to cook after work, wouldn’t be able to make it to my workout classes on those four work days (and I typically go almost everyday after work), wouldn’t be able to have any down time on those four days and let’s face it, I’m lucky if I can get 4-5 hours of actual productivity at work, let alone 8, let alone 10. You’d still have to pay for childcare for 40 hours total. The savings in gas from not driving that extra day is probably negligible. 

Now a 4 day 32 hour work week? That I can get behind ;)"

Second, what was going on with your blonde hair? To me it looked like they gave you awful extensions then got mad when the awful extensions looked awful. Was it common that the makeovers just weren’t good quality?"
AskDocs,fmuwejq,t1_fmuv6qh,1586400384.0,"SAME. It’s called PRE menstrual symptoms for a reason - the awful symptoms are supposed to be before. 

It’s interesting reading women have mood issues while menstruating. I always assumed the assumption women are moody are “on their period” came from men not understanding what PMS actually refers to. But I shouldn’t be surprised at this point that everybody’s gonna experience hormone changes differently!!"

bestoflegaladvice,flrvxfy,t1_flr6bzr,1585428990.0,"Yeah I recently tried to go off my Lexapro because I'm in a really good place and after one day of not taking it (I had weaned off of it for 2 weeks), I was very quickly reminded of the terrible way I used to constantly feel for no reason. 

I only wanted to go off of them because my therapist insisted that SSRIs could be temporary and you could wean off once you get to a good place and learn coping skills. I like Lexapro and have no real side effects besides needing more sleep, though, but decided to try going off of it. My doctor was like ""you know you can stay on if you like it, right?"" and I'm like ""nah I'll try not taking it!""

I was super anxious and unable to sleep that first night, unsure if I should continue with going off of them, when I read on the lexapro subreddit related to taking them forever or not: ""You only get one life, might as well find the peace in it where you can."" And that felt so true - I don't mind being on a med for the rest of my life if it gives me the peace I never knew was possible and doesn't affect me otherwise. 

Also, super glad I didn't go off of it right before this pandemic because I should be struggling a lot more than I already am right now."

AskFeminists,flba0sx,t3_fnqjo3,1585000410.0,"I feel this strongly. I think what helps me for me is realizing that I don't hate *men* \- what I really hate is toxic masculinity and patriarchy. I hate the toxic behaviors that it encourages. 

It really is like taking off the rose-colored glasses - you're going to be more distrustful and judgmental of men and their behavior, but that's fine. Of course, in my opinion, you SHOULD be. 

I don't think your feelings are unhealthy. You're pissed off at prejudice! That's fine! But if it really is causing you a lot of distress, try to limit your exposure to the things that make you angry (for example, I used to be a LOT angrier when I browsed pickup artist sites). I think the feelings of anger will fade once it all stops feeling so new, too.

It's good not to have toxic people in your life, but having a nice boyfriend and knowing ""good"" men exists doesn't really help me feel much better about all this lol. What helps me is being strong in these beliefs as my morals and trusting myself, knowing that I know what I want in the people around me (ESPECIALLY relationships and sex with men), and trusting myself to make  healthy choices in the people I spend time with. 

And honestly fuck ppl telling you to get therapy because you DARE to be pissed at patriarchy and decide you don't want to deal with misogynists in your life. You're allowed to be pissed."

I got it pretty bad in my wrists back in November/December from Muay Thai, working a desk job at a computer, and just generally being on my phone a lot. I had some time off in December from Muay Thai and it went away. I would ice it and that would relieve a lot of the pain.

stopdrinking,ffax0up,t3_esgmif,1579746460.0,"Please seek counseling, especially if you’re having suicidal thoughts. 

When I first quit drinking, my mood was all over the place and I was majorly depressed. Everybody on this sub kept saying they felt so much better, but I just continued to feel worse and cried all day. 

After two months of no improvements, I gave antidepressants a try and they finally made me feel like a normal human being for the first time in years. Now I’m done with therapy and might come off the meds soon as well.

I’m not saying that you’ll need them, but I do suggest counseling as it helped me figure out how to navigate the emotions I suppressed for years by drinking!!! 

Just remember you’re not your negative thoughts and things WILL get better"

exredpill,ex6qlv2,t3_crm6ci,1566049927.0,"You're not comfortable with being dominant in bed (you say so yourself), so you should really give yourself the permission to accept this about yourself. Maybe you need to consider why you are so willing to continue a sexual relationship that makes you this uncomfortable. 

I'm a woman and not into any kind of BDSM or power play or being dominated or dominating, and if a guy tried to introduce that into the bedroom, I would be uncomfortable and I would just peace out. 

This is going to be a terribly unpopular opinion, and this isn't the hill I'll die on but a personal opinion, but I find domination and submission in the bedroom to be terribly problematic. I don't want a lover who gets off on hurting me. I recently went on a date with a guy who shared the same views as me on this, and it was VERY much an attractive quality. I think we are very much socialized to have these turn ons and want these dynamics, and I think it's completely normal to not like them!!!

Most importantly: just because one woman is turned on by what the redpill says women are turned on by does not mean that their philosophies are correct. And you say it yourself, she wants the domination in the context of a safe and caring relationship - the manipulation and emotional witholding/abuse done by redpill men is inherently NEVER a safe and caring relationship. I bet you that if this woman dated a redpill man, even if sexually she was being dominated...she'd still be getting emotionally abused and she's not going to like that. And maybe she likes you because you are able to empathize and aren't an awful redpill guy.

I don't know if this helped at all. I hope it did. I think it's valid to take some time and consider what you are actually comfortable with. The fact that you don't get much pleasure from dominating woman is another thing that sets you apart from the redpill men (not that men who like domination are all redpillers, but just saying)"
