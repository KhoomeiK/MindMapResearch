The sword does a lot of damage so it’s not that the Zandatsu doesn’t kill enemies.

If you want to make it up to your dad I recommend you work extra hard to help him out whenever you make a mistake, but for god’s sake don’t kill yourself because of how another person might think of you. Personally, I’m at the point in my life where I’m spiteful and a prick to everyone and will most likely not snap out of that until the things I can’t control get better, but that’s what makes me suicidal, the things I can’t control. i’m confident you can better yourself and learn to not make as many mistakes, and even if you can’t, you can always fix them.

I don’t think people necessarily view others as “burdens” or “worthless” because they didn’t turn out or behave exactly how they wanted/expected, and I’m confident this is all in your head. Maybe talk to the people close to you and see how you can make things up to them and have them tell you they’re proud of you regardless, it sounds dumb but I think it will help."
