WatchPeopleDieInside,fr2k7pp,t1_fr1jb1g,1589838743.0,Yea that was the wildest part. The main guy seemed to not care or understand the risk and endangerment he was putting others in. Thankfully guy #2 seemed to have a bit more neurons and I believe an off camera fight between them is the only way they made it back without one/both of them waking up in an obituary. I couldn't imagine having that load and then go downhill with it. What throws me off the most about the oil is he couldn't tell from smell alone something was up. I'm not a mechanic by any means but I have been around enough oil to know that has a particular scent especially when heated.

Skills: blue&green trees with focus on symbiosis and action skill cool down. Gamma burst, atomic aroma, and endurance. This allows fast action skill reset and lengthy duration. Eridian Skag

Shield: Fallout Red Suit. 3237 capacity. Constant 744 rad dmg/s area of effect, upon break 5205 radiation nova, and immune to all rad dmg. It is weak capacity wise but this is a shield you want to be broken.

Gun: Disciplined Star Helix. Annointed while gamma burst is active gain 65% rad dmg.

Relic: Snowdrift Loaded Dice. Increase luck, +102% slide speed, -75% health, +29 rad resistance, +16% shock dmg, +16% rad dmg, and ice to your slides. Im currently running this just for the luck boost so I can find better gear. The rad resistence is pointless and the -75% health hurts. Thankfully pupper and I heal each other with the dmg we deal, he can res me, and his kills count towards my 2nd wind so its manageable.

Class mod: Clawing Vulpine De4deye. Sk4g and I deal +35% to enemies above 75% health. +2until you are dead,+1two f4ang, +2go for the eyes. This is just a mod that I really liked. Doesn't add the the theme.

I was running Crit Fl4k before the first nerf. Granted Crit Fl4k was hella more powerful but this setup is so much more enjoyable to play and I love my lil Chernobyl pupper."
