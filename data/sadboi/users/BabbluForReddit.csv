The 4th dimension what you feel moght be like a lower level of astral plane. The demons can read our memories. They might try to impersonate your friends. If you really want to test it out, next time when you speak to your friends from other dimension,  try asking them their personal questions which you don't know. Say like ask your friend what he ate before he died i.e., what his mom served him the before night or something like that.  You can confirm that with his mom casually. If the answer is correct then they could be your friends, else you are in serious trouble.

See this test simply proves that demons acting like your friends only can read your mind. They act only based on your awareness or model of data you had on your friend. Since you dont know what he ate last night, demons cant tell the answer. Even if  they say it, mostly it could  be wrong,  tracing their response, it could be a random thing from saved memories related to your casual lunch with your friends in past."

LetsNotMeet,fn12t1j,t3_fyk9hx,1586553655.0,"See there could be any number of possibilities.  Here are few from my side 

1. Like everyone said, it could be your moms bf

2. It could be a pedophile. He stalked you guys. He knew your names. He could have got them from your mom or dad. He could be your mom's lawyer or dad's lawyer who got divorce or sent your mom to jail? He couldn't be parent of any kid in your school as teachers might recognize him


3. He could've been your father's colleague? People are really that way


4. Looking at changing cars, he could have borrowed them or simply he owns them. Might be a agent who was assigned to kidnap you guys. But by whom? Maybe your father's enemies? Maybe your grandparents from your mom side didn't want you kids to be with your dad? Like you said your mom had many creepy bfs, so he could have been your mom's ex who wanted to take revenge on your mom by doing things to you? No nameplate car fits to those creepy exes. 


5. You said he followed you in streets as well, might be a local? Or it could have been a professional/person who have a strong urge to complete his job. He didn't try to reason with teacher when you told them, instead he escaped. This shows that he is surely planning to do awful things to you.


6. One point to analyze is that whenever he tried to pick you guys from school, he always followed the protocol. He revealed his face to you and your teachers.I am guessing your school doesn't have cameras at the pickup location. He might have known it by doing some sort of study for few days.Also he might not be from your town if things happened and teachers tell police, he could have escaped by then. Or this could also be that he is too naive to do any coverup from his side.


7. Did he showup after you left to your stepmom? 



One thing for sure is that the person's behavior was more than anything that confirms that your life would have totally been different if anyone of you hopped onto his car. It could be different in absolutely bad way. You're safe, that's important. Also I am hoping he doesn't showup again."
