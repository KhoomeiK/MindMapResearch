You already know what you want to study, so start looking into universities with highly rated business colleges. That will narrow down the search. Once you've identified some schools, start researching the professors and decide who you would be most excited to study with. Think about the student populations of the schools - are there many nontraditional students or will you be one of a few? Decide if that's important to you. Does the culture of the school fit with your ideals?

Take at least 30 credits of basics at a community college. This will make you a transfer student and make admissions easier.

Hospitals are not infallible and it's well studied that women, and minority women in particular, don't always receive equal or adequate care

I'm not, like, advocating for home birth. Anecdotally I know many women who have had successful home births - one mom I know has had all 4 of hers at home (attended by an experienced midwife) 

I had my daughter in a very very nice hospital in a wealthy part of Texas. Everything went according to plan and was just fine. But I recognize that's not always the case. Sometimes when women speak up to say they think something is wrong, they aren't heard. Or listened to. Or believed. We know this from empirical studies

BackToCollege,fclrh4h,t3_ehu96y,1577754684.0,"I'm getting my master's online from a public university in my state - they actually prefer that students take 2 classes (6 credits) per semester. My in-state tuition for two classes is around $2500 per semester 

Search around and avoid private, for-profit schools. Look at public university options. Most will have a specific time limit you must finish in 6 years or something like that. Most programs are 30-36 credit hours and can be finished in 2 years, going part time in fall, spring and summer

Like if you know you need 2 parts sugar for every 1 part cocoa you use, and 4 parts flour per 2 parts sugar - you just have to start with one ingredient and then add the correct proportions of others 

I don't think I'd ever be able to really teach anyone any of my recipes haha"
