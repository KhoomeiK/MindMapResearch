It's the simliar principle with sociopaths. Things have shifted their values and explanations for everything, a comfort they live by. The only way to make them shift back is by empathy and respect for who they are and why they are.

But racists are treated as some ""SCARY"" monster that you get exclusive interviews with, or they're just treated like bacteria of no value.

 We're mammals. It's in our instincts to differ and to identify more with a certain group, but we also have a consciousness and with that we can work to go against those primary instincts so that we don't discriminate people on autopilot.
