dating_advice,fq1sopk,t3_ggkjw0,1589048739.0,"You call it quits when you don’t look at them the same anymore. If everything they do pisses you off, when there’s more bad times than good. 

When the relationship gets to the point that you don’t care where they are, what they’re doing, how there day was. If you find yourself imagining what it would be like to see someone new and liking what you’re imagining. 

If when you roll over in the morning and see their face, but you no longer see someone you want to spend the rest of your days with. 

When little tiny things turn into big blow ups, big fights. That’s when you call it quits. Because no longer is their love the light airy, butterfly feeling in your belly. 

Instead their love turns into a heavy, weighing you down,make you question everything kind of feeling."

But even when a mother acts this way, it stills hurts more when they are dead. Trust me. A mother who is alive still has time to make amends, change. A dead mother can do none of those things."
AmItheAsshole,fpfohyk,t3_gd70ln,1588577847.0,"YTA, well at least a little bit. Grief you feel towards your mother because she isn’t the mother you need her to be is very real. But speaking from the experience of losing my mother, her grief is very real as well. 

I don’t think she was trying to one up you. I think she was simply explaining that you are blessed your mother is still in the flesh. 

I can understand because I sympathize with her. Sometimes we have to step in the other persons shoes to understand sometimes things have more than one feeling that can be felt in a situation."

My thoughts are frank is worth way more alive than dead anyways. He does so much for Annalise."

I’m a Christian myself, but nothing anyone says or does can change who your brother was, or what has happened. If you believe there is nothing after this life, your brother is long gone. He has returned to the dirt from which he came, It can longer effect your brother so I’m not understanding why it’s affecting you now. You’re wanting to protect your bothers atheism, which no longer exists because he doesn’t. So just let it go. I’m sorry for your loss."
