rtms,fgkf3md,t3_eyoy5g,1580864078.0,"Hi there,

I've done multiple rounds of rTMS, of different types, like thetaburst etc. Each time I get more relief for longer periods of time. I'll never not be on medication though. I had rTMS for MDD, OCD, PTSD. I am currently 4.5 years out of my last treatment of 30 sessions. 

In the second week of treatment, I crashed. Like I was incredibly emotional, anxious (to the point of agoraphobia), discouraged and pessimistic. Middle of the 3rd week, I didn't notice a change but everyone around me did. They said I was more amiable to hanging out, I laughed more, I had better concentration. I didn't see any of this, but I think it's often the case - people notice before we do, however highly self-aware we are. 

Sometimes things get weird as the brain ""wakes up.""

Around the same time, I noticed that my obsessive thoughts started to make no sense to me (which frightened me), and I could actually envision not having to perform the compulsion - but that took a ton of work on my part b/c compulsions are so physical and behavioral.  


So maybe ask other people around you if they notice a difference...   


1st round: I did (sorry i can't remember all the names) 20 sessions of 11 minutes per side. about 3/4 of the way through I started getting out a bit more, which made me drink more, which for me is not a good coupling w/ depression, however social the drinking was. I got 10 booster sessions after that.   


2nd round: 2 years later - about 6 months before i started rTMS again, i was slipping fast. This time i got thetaburst. 2x a day, 30 minutes apart as part of a study (how i could afford it). which was supposed to be 10 sessions (but 20 treatments) It didn't speed up the effects for me, so they added an additional 10 w/ the same protocol. 

It's been 4.5 years since that last treatment, and I'd go again if I needed to.

Happy to answer any questions."
Healthyhooha,ff5qqik,t1_ff5qfs8,1579606446.0,"Thanks for the reminder. My insert says 24 hours, some online places say 3 days. 

i actually wasn't able to start the gel last night, so i'll start it tonight - but part of me is like, wow, this seemingly hardcore med only works in 50% of people - maybe i should just go the boric acid route. However, i can't find anything about checking medication interactions w/ that and something i'm on. Alas....

Thanks again for your response :)"
