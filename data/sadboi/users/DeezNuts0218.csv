That's Western propaganda right?

>Housing was guaranteed by the law

That doesn't mean homelessness didn't exist which you initially falsely stated. Read the source I linked, there were still tons of homeless people who were orphans of executed or imprisoned citizens (of which there were many). Soviet Union similarly ""guaranteed"" employment for everyone yet there were still unemployed people and high rates of crime. It's almost as if things written on paper don't necessarily manifest in reality. Oh but I forgot that's all Western propaganda and all that matters is that you read some socialist publishing stating that the Soviet Union didn't have unemployment or homelessness without looking an inch further into it.

The Irish famine might have resulted from laissez-faire (sorry if I butchered that) economic planning but it killed 1 million across 4 years(1845-1849). The Chinese famines of 1958-1962 saw 20-40 million deaths and a doubling of the death rate.

Bengal famine (3 million starved to death in 1943) was a colonial atrocity no doubt, but it was a wartime famine during the colonial eras. I would look at that as more of a result of the brutal British colonial practices, overpopulation, and wartime demand than a result of capitalism’s flaws. Now if we look at Holodomor which has conservative death estimate of 3 million ranging up to 7 million, and consider that 15 countries have declared it a genocide, how does that compare to Bengal famine?

Colonial exploitation was inexcusable but not on the same scale of atrocity as communist ethnic cleansing and genocide. Furthermore, colonialism ended along with capitalism’s crimes against humanity whereas North Korea is still one of the most unfortunate places on the planet to exist in as a result of being a socialist authoritarian state. Venezuelans are eating zoo animals and pets to avoid the starvation and famine wrought by their socialist government. Western invasions of Korea and Vietnam are justified as they tried to contain the spread of communism which is as close to a cancer or disease as an ideology can get.

>Soviet Union and China were and are not liberal democracies so they can’t be compared 

Soviet legal theory states “it is the government who is the beneficiary of human rights which are to be asserted against the individual”. There’s a fundamental ideological difference right there, West believes that humans are born with rights and government must serve to recognize and protect them. Soviet Communists believe that humans are granted rights by the government which effectively makes the citizens subjects of the government. If you cannot see the problem there then there is some wrong with your worldview that I cannot fix.
 
>The USSR abolished unemployment and guaranteed housing

Lmao that’s just false. The Soviets were too busy buildings nukes and pushing a wartime economy almost to worry about the needs of the individual.

[The tendency of the state to prioritize gigantic industrial concerns coupled with wartime destruction meant the large Soviet cities seldom could adequately house their population of workers. Although the Khrushchev era alleviated the housing shortages greatly through the use of prefabricated rebar-concrete structures, these buildings could still be quite cramped and unsatisfactory for family living. Furthermore, maintenance for these buildings could be somewhat patchwork and this became an issue during the low years of the Brezhnev-era economic stagnation.  Field-research on Soviet homelessness of the 1970s and 1980s found that stresses within the family helped fuel the Soviet homeless problem. While this particular cause for homelessness is far from unique, there were specific aspects of Soviet family life that could make the problem of an unhappy family worse. The twin historical crises of both Stalinism and the Second World War added strains to some Soviet families as children lost one or both parents. For war orphans, Soviet orphanages and group homes were frequently underfunded and their wards subject to various abuses. Remarriage could also potentially introduce new strains in family life. This led to both incidents of juvenile delinquency and runaways. The Soviet police and good deal of the public saw this as a crisis of youth hooliganism, especially in the 1950s, and Soviet youth charged with these offensives often found themselves sent to work camps or other reformatories. For a lot of youthful offenders, they became a marginalized underclass later in life. The labor colonies and youth hostels were not surprisingly quite harsh and the state was more concerned with observing this population than providing for it. In a state that regulated both movement and residency, the official stigma of a criminal record made it very difficult for individuals to break out this system in adulthood. These problems in the family, socially-charged policing, and anemic social safety net helped further encourage transiency.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4ljfhy/were_there_homeless_people_in_the_ussr/)

From that same post: Soviet mental health care was notoriously deficient throughout the existence of the USSR and Soviet psychiatry was quite a different animal than in the West. Soviet psychiatry tended to identify mental health problems as fundamentally biological in origin. Soviet discourse on mental health focused heavily on issues of ""abnormal minds,"" (in the words of Khrushchev), and treated those with mental health issues as if there was something physically wrong with them. This meant that those who suffered from problems of mental health frequently did not get effective treatment, but instead suffered social ostracization and exclusion. 


Within this context, Soviet individuals who found themselves vagrants for whatever reason faced a series of stark alternatives. When caught, the state often tried to force them to relocate to group work camps or dormitories within the Soviet periphery were they could be observed. The quality of life at these facilities left much to be desired and many elected to escape. The other option was to carve out a space in the underground and grey areas of the Soviet economy. While nominally free of state regulation (although the danger was always there), this meant interacting with a hardened criminal element. In both options, these individuals suffered from social death and were not considered either by the state or society at large to belong to the Soviet experiment, but rather were often put among the scapegoats for its failures.

Since Soviets had such great living standards and human rights for their citizens, how come there were human rights movements in the 60s calling for freedom of expression, political lean, and religion in the Soviet Union? I think we can throw freedom of speech out of the window, that hasn't existed in any long-standing communist regime in history.

[Like other dissidents in the post-Stalin Soviet Union, human rights activists were subjected to a broad range of repressive measures.

China:


Can you explain how Mao's local officials overseeing communes exploiting workers and taking their food supply (starving them) to provide a surplus to the government is simply a ""string of bad harvests""?

[https://www.scmp.com/article/723956/revisiting-calamitous-time](https://www.scmp.com/article/723956/revisiting-calamitous-time)

Looks like even CCP documents support the notion of the oppression of the communist government. Have a look at this segment in that South China article I linked:

>Dikotter, a native of the Netherlands, uses new material from China. 'While Communist Party archives are still very closely guarded, over the past four or five years, they have gradually opened up to the extent that serious research has become possible on the famine,' he said.

>Most of the material comes from 10 provincial archives chosen on the basis of openness, including those of Gansu , Guangdong, Hebei , Hubei , Hunan , Shandong , Sichuan , Yunnan and Zhejiang .

>’Provincial archives are not only much richer than the smaller collections which can be found in counties, cities or even villages, but they also tend to keep copies of important files that were sent to them from above, namely Beijing,' he said.

>’The death toll stands at a minimum of 45 million excess deaths ... Coercion, terror and systematic violence were the foundations of the Great Leap Forward. Thanks to the meticulous reports compiled by the party itself, we can infer that, between 1958 and 1962, by a rough approximation, six to eight per cent of the victims were tortured to death or summarily killed, amounting to at least 2.5 million people.

>’Other victims were deliberately deprived of food and starved to death. Many more vanished because they were too old, weak or sick to work - and hence unable to earn their keep. People were killed selectively because they were rich, because they dragged their feet, because they spoke out or simply because they were not liked, for whatever reason, by the man who wielded the ladle in the canteen.'

>He estimated that at least three million died of starvation and disease in gulags - labour and re-education camps set up by local governments - out of the eight to nine million detained in such camps during the Great Leap Forward. Between one and three million committed suicide.



I don't see how you can push the narrative that communist atrocities are excused because conditions were even more dire before in a discussion about the worst manmade famine in history. Mao could have certainly brought about better times for China (though they would be unsustainable because communism is a broken ideology), but he chose the interests of the party and the national image over the lives of his people.


As a couple side questions: What do you make of Mao declaring sparrows as ""birds of capitalism"" and driving them to near extinction along with several other animals in his Four Pests campaign? And what do you make of Tiananmen Square when the government rolled out tanks and soldiers to open fire and flatten protestors? That's Western propaganda too right?

&#x200B;

Since you claim that socialist states are free and are only portrayed otherwise as a result of Western propaganda, what would you say about all of the North Korean defectors who risk their lives trying to escape from the country? What would you say about the fact that the government throws their families and extended families into death camps upon defection? Since North Korea the socialist state is such a free and peaceful society, surely they must see a lot of tourism and surely there are a lot of pictures and videos from tourists on the internet right?

Mao’s Great Leap Forward was IIRC the worst famine ever killing between 20 to 40 million people and increasing China’s death rate from 1.2% to 2.5% basically doubling between 58 and 62.

For the USSR: 

At first, the Soviet Union experienced rapid economic growth. While the lack of open markets providing price signals and incentives to direct economic activity led to waste and economic inefficiencies, the Soviet economy posted an estimated average annual growth rate in gross national product (GNP) of 5.8% from 1928 to 1940, 5.7% from 1950 to 1960, and 5.2% from 1960 to 1970. (There was a dip to a 2.2% rate between 1940 to 1950.)

The impressive performance was largely due to the fact that, as an underdeveloped economy, the Soviet Union could adopt Western technology while forcibly mobilizing resources to implement and utilize such technology. An intense focus on industrialization and urbanization at the expense of personal consumption gave the Soviet Union a period of rapid modernization. However, once the country began to catch up with the West, its ability to borrow ever-newer technologies, and the productivity effects that came with it, soon diminished.

Yeah you’re right. The Chinese government is way better at locking innocents in concentration camps, shooting at protestors, censoring journalists, and infringing on human rights. China is better at all those things compared to the US.

>most Chinese don’t care about freedom of speech 

Probably because they’ve never truly had it. China’s recent history is full of censorship, disinformation, propaganda, and violations of human rights. When you have something and it’s under threat of being snatched from you, only

I can’t even entertain your analogy for American police and African American protestors. Black people literally fought for their rights and protested all during the 50s and 60s. They had to face water cannons, batons, and gas grenades all the same. People rioted in LA again after Rodney King was beaten by police after speeding down a highway for like 30 mins. And black people protest and riot to this day in places like Ferguson and Baltimore where cases of police brutality and extrajudicial black murder have happened. But guess what? 

None of them have been as bloody or violent as Tiananmen Square when the government rolled out soldiers and tanks to open fire and flatten thousands of protestors. Surprisingly I didn’t see you make a point to defend that one.

Not sure what your Falun Gong source was able to find or not find back in 2006, but there is conclusive evidence that states that the Chinese govt executes more prisoners on a yearly basis despite China keeping that info secret. Several human rights orgs around the world state that China executes far more prisoners than any other country, and China themselves released a statement saying they would be abolishing the practice of unconsenting organ harvestation.

The whistleblower who exposed the truth of COVID to the world and then was basically warned by Wuhan officials to keep his mouth shut?

Freedom of press and journalism cannot coexist in a state that relies on propaganda to “guide the public opinion” in Xi’s own words.

You don’t seem to be informed on how social credit works: 
As of November 2019, in addition to dishonest and fraudulent financial behavior, other behavior that some cities have officially listed as negative factors of credit ratings includes playing loud music or eating in rapid transits,[31] violating traffic rules such as jaywalking and red-light violations,[32][33] making reservations at restaurants or hotels but not showing up,[34] failing to correctly sort personal waste,[35][36][37] fraudulently using other people's public transportation ID cards,[38] etc;

Social credit violations can put you on a “blacklist”. Certain personal information of the blacklisted people is deliberately made accessible to the society and is displayed online as well as at various public venues such as movie theaters and buses,[45][46][47][48] while some cities have also banned children of ""untrustworthy"" residents from attending private schools and even universities.[49][50][51][52][53]

Since you say this kind of practice isn’t uncommon and even present in NYC, can you please provide sources to that effect?

This is a bonus point I’d like to pursue. What do you make of China “extraditing” North Korean “defectors” (escapees) back to North Korea where they will join their families in labor(death) camps?

So they started taking more and more grain and crops from the local farmers citing there were “surpluses” and effectively starved the workers that way. 

All in all, between 20 to 40 million people died during this “Great Leap Forward” between 1958 and 1962. China also saw its death rate double in this timespan (from 1.2% to 2.5%). 

With this Great Leap Forward came similarly boneheaded policies like the Four Pests campaign where Mao’s govt declared birds to be “public animals of capitalism” and invested govt resources to eradicate birds, flies, cockroaches, and rats. This pushed the sparrow populations in China to extinction. This campaign also included other pests outside the 4 listed, and saw the South China tiger population dip to near extinction (10-20 wild individual tigers) as CCP officials paid 30 yuan bounties for tiger pelts.

Since communists seem hell bent on blaming literally any death on capitalism, I’ll also throw in Yezhovshchina where Stalin’s government summary executed and mass murdered half a million people for political dissidence.

Mao’s “Great Leap Forward” speaks for itself but his communist government caused one of the worst famines in history claiming over 20 million lives, doubling the national death rate in that timespan. IMO this alone should end any comparisons between communist and capitalist atrocities but some of you have rather thick skulls. Mao’s cultural revolution where he gave his Red Guards the green light to murder anyone they deemed a “counter-revolutionary” saw the deaths of over a million people at the hands of Mao’s police force. And who can forget Tiananmen Square when the communist government imposed martial law and sent tanks out to roll over and kill protestors.

North Korea shouldn’t even need to be argued against considering it still has operational concentration camps that exist today **in 2020**. Historians estimate that at least a million people have died in their labor camps, at least 100,000 have been flat out executed, and defectors’ families are subjected to labor camp service for life for generations.

Although thousands of protesters simply tried to escape, others fought back, stoning the attacking troops and setting fire to military vehicles. Reporters and Western diplomats there that day estimated that hundreds to thousands of protesters were killed in the Tiananmen Square Massacre, and as many as 10,000 were arrested.

Leaders worldwide, including [Gorbachev](https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/04/i-do-not-want-red-square-to-look-like-tiananmen-square/), condemned the military action and, less than a month later, the United States Congress voted to impose economic sanctions against China, citing human rights violations.

IDGAF where r/politics is on your global political spectrum. I’m saying that objectively speaking it’s just as much of an echo chamber as T_D or any other subreddit is yet Reddit uses it to publish political news posing as a neutral political subreddit. That’s a clear cut instance of leftist bias.

We can trade anecdotal examples of subreddits being bad all we want but T_D a) was not as bad as you’re making it out to be otherwise the mods would outright ban or shut it down instead of quarantining for a few months and then closing it silently like they have and b) was more of a fan club for Trump than a political discourse subreddit like r/communism, r/politics, etc. It’s an echo chamber almost by design unlike several leftist echo chambers which are like that mostly because that’s how leftists inherently are. Communists historically suppressed dissenting opinions and outright genocided political opposition en masse so it’s no surprise r/communism drops the ban hammer so willingly. You’re not going to be very receptive to challenging questions when you know your ideology is inherently morally wrong.

IIRC there are subs like AskT_D which won’t ban you for asking questions. Contrast that with r/communism101 which is specifically designed to ask questions about communism and you’ll get banned for questioning Stalin’s motives in Holodomor or Mao’s competence during the Great Leap Forward.
