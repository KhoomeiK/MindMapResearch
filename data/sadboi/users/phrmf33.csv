Now the table seems to have turned... What do I know? We'll see, I guess.

Additional info: I'm not saying all mental illness is the same, obviously. However, for the sake of transparency, I assume I've been sort of mentally ill for a long time -- a lot of anxiety and long bouts of depression, medication, therapy, the works --, but curiously not bad enough not to function... I have just been feeling something's terribly off (I'm a millennial). Maybe now it's become visible to more people.
