SexToysCollection,fr55ala,t3_gmqbop,1589902753.0,That doesn't look battery operated to me. Sometimes the charging port is extremely small with waterproof toys which it looks like this is. Is there a chance you may have forgotten since it's been so long? It might only look like a pin pick or a hole that looks like pencil lead would fit into. Good luck.
