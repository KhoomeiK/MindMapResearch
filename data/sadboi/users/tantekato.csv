I was standing before an old house and after a while the garage door opened and a car came out and stopped next to me. The man was about 70 and invited me in the car. I showed him the address of my father and there we went. 

He talked the whole time in Danish and I did not understand a word. Than he spoke a little German and I understand he learned German in the war. After 20 minutes or so we arrived at my fathers house. I thanked him for his kind help. He waited until I was inside.
