Anxiety,f7hdyhn,t3_dw5gdv,1573738659.0,"I've found it to be normal. I actually just started therapy again and was feeling low so I talked to a friend afterwards who's also a counselor and she explained that each session we are actively dealing with the stuff we spend every other minute of the day avoiding. It puts a lot of mental strain on us so it follows that you'd leave feeling exposed and drained. It actually made me feel better because I've quit a bunch of times. It's hard work!

The hard part is pushing through it, especially if you find a therapist that you like. Try thinking of it less like they're suppose to fix you and more like they're giving you a safe space to lay it all out and sort through it. Like friends/loved ones are supposed to.

Wishing you luck💖"

wilfred,f7ecj49,t3_bqrwfi,1573653992.0,"I've always thought the basement represented Ryan's mind. Like every time he would retreat to the basement to conference with Wilfred about whatever was happening in the episode. Take a look at the episode where we has a panic attack about Geoffery crying, the episode where he tries to stop smoking and tidy up in there, the episode where him Wilfred and Bruce play the game that leads him to realize he needed to come clean to Amanda.

Hope this helps :) I frequently return to binging this show when I've come out of a depressive episode and can't leave the house."
wilfred,f7ebjyl,t3_c8l8o3,1573653190.0,Everytime I re watch it I'm reminded of how shitty a lot of Jennas behavior was way before Ryan even realized. I always feel like it was Wilfreds job to lead Ryan to happiness and part of that was understanding that he could be happy without her.

I just got it back and I barely look at it enough to warrant having it anymore. 

You got this."

bisexualadults,f2jsvnl,t3_dcelnv,1570277271.0,"I have trouble sealing the deal usually because I'm a shybi but what I've found that works most of the time with anyone I'm super into is being funny first and flirty second. I hide behind humor when I'm nervous so if I can get the girl/guy to laugh my confidence goes up and its much easier to feel them out before I put myself out there. Then if rejection comes you just have more 'material' for the next go round. 

Best of luck!"
