domesticviolence,fqmctib,t3_g32tte,1589475329.0,"You’re in denial about the abuse. I was in abusive relationships so I get it. The best thing I did for myself was when I reached a point and realized he kept controlling me and was taking my possibility of a better future away. I checked myself into the psych Ward for the weekend and did a lot of thinking. I had my best friend and family come talk to me and I asked their opinion of who this abuser was. This is not a good man for you or anyone. You are with an abusive person and you’re telling him it’s totally fine for him to treat you this way by staying. You need to know there’s a life outside of where you are now that is better. One were you can be with all your friends and family, leave the abuse, and get to experience new and exciting things in life. You think you’re in love, but you’re obsessed with what you think is love. He doesn’t love you. He likes controlling and abusing you. This love is sick. You could really benefit from taking time away from him. Since it’s quarantine, stay with your family or a friend. Don’t be trapped with this monster and allow him to keep hurting you. I’m sad for you because I know you’re ‘in love’ and wont leave him probably until he really hurts you or when he finally takes everything away from you and he’s caused you to separate from your friends and family. Good luck to you.

Edit. You’re not of low value. He is. I also want you to see how you’re hiding and protecting a rapist. You need to know he’s raped you. When someone doesn’t listen to no, they are raping you. A good healthy relationship isn’t about hiding anything. I got out of 2 abusive relationships, there has to be a time when you’re alone and grow to know yourself without any other person. And don’t you dare get pregnant and damn a kid into this bullshit abusive life."

glutenfreerecipes,fkhcacx,t3_fia1zl,1584195194.0,"One of my fave recipes: 
Paleo spaghetti squash spaghetti

1 lb ground grass-fed beef (the fattier the better);
2 tbsp ghee;
1/4 cup bacon, chopped;
1 large onion, chopped and diced;
3 cloves garlic, minced;
3 carrots, diced;
2 celery sticks, diced;
2 tsp dried oregano;
2 tbsp tomato paste;
1 bay leaf;
The equivalent of 2 cans whole meaty tomatoes;
Optional heavy cream (makes the sauce less acidic);
Fresh parsley for garnishing.
2 medium spaghetti squash

You can use less fat if your ground beef is fatty, but it’s really a question of taste. Cook the ground beef and bacon for about 5 minutes.
Remove the meat with a slotted spoon and set aside.
Use the same Dutch oven or pot to cook the other ingredients (carrots, celery, onion, garlic and oregano). Cook the vegetables until soft at medium heat.
Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, ground beef, bacon and bay leaf. You can break the tomatoes a bit, but the cooking process will break them anyway.
