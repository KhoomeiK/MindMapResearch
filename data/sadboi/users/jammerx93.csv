I have been using headspace for few months as well as DBT  course in Udemy by Yvette Vardy.
Apart from this i have been maintaining a habit journal As well as diary. 
The first few months It was hard as hell then it became gradually easier, as arithmetok said mindfulness is the building block upon which you build your DBT skills.
The free DBT course in Udemy has a worksheet and positive psychology has 20 worksheets that you can check out.

Its not much to say but you are not alone in this fight and 
Its never too late for a fresh start and there will always be chances to get better. 

Since your flair is coping skills needed and i am assuming you have been diagnosed recently I will point out a few resources for you and hopefully they would be helpful.

1. Check out DBT on positive psychology

https://positivepsychology.com/dbt-dialectical-behavior-therapy/

2. You could get DBT course on Udemy by Yvette Vardy, it has helped me a lot in coping with my volatile emotions.

3. You could see a therapist who specialises in DBT.


I have seen changes within a year ever since I started dialectical Behavioral therapy. 
Its still a struggle but life is so much clearer and more optimistic for me now than it was. My relationships have improved and i have reconnected with friends who i pushed away, made new friends who i could never have before.
And this is from a guy who used to have suicidal thoughts every night.

One thing i have learned is that the only person who can rescue you is yourself.

Do whatever it takes to get better.
I believe you can do it, Best of luck and take care."

I dont hate him now but i used to when  i was a kid and he used to be stressed out all the time and  was probably unaware When he blew up and it was tramautic. To be honest i think he has an inkling that he has a problem but has no idea how to deal with it And is terrified to tell anyone else about  it.
Right now i am doing dbt and seeing things non judgmentally and without blame is helping a lot.
Since still blaming him wont heal my mind being forgiving and caring will."
