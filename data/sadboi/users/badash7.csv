We‚Äôd go the first two weeks of the month with as much food as we wanted and then the last two weeks with nothing but school lunch. It was basically a free for all, first come first served. Till this day I struggle with food and get extreme anxiety. If I make dinner for me, my husband, and my littler sister I have to make sure that it‚Äôs all gone because I don‚Äôt like to waste food and if I keep the leftovers in the fridge it almost never gets ate. Even though I haven‚Äôt gone hungry for many years there‚Äôs always that thought in the back of my mind of ‚ÄúI have to eat as much as I can now because who knows when I‚Äôll get a good meal next‚Äù."

Flaunting your multiple homes while your brother and many others struggle to have one for their family is yuck.

BPD,fqjpnri,t1_fqjlx26,1589413380.0,Honestly it‚Äôs just holding my tongue. I have a problem with saying the first thing I think. When we get in fights I just hold my tongue because usually I know I shouldn‚Äôt say what I‚Äôm about to say and then say it anyways so I‚Äôm just practicing not saying it at all because even if it gets me satisfaction in the moment after the fact I feel like shit. So when I hold my tongue I‚Äôll wish I would‚Äôve said for about 10 minutes after and then I become glad I didn‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt like saying things I don‚Äôt mean in the spur of the moment because it ends up satisfying no one.

FortCollins,fq8wq8v,t3_ghcker,1589177791.0,I work as a babysitter and the family I work for make me wear a mask. Today my husband went to get a haircut at a local place and the manager plus one other woman were there giving haircuts to people one at a time and were being safe. The barber told him that the person before him had thrown a fit about being required to wear a mask and that he would refuse to pay if he had to wear one. Luckily the convinced him to do so but the man would only pay if he would be able to pay with his mask off so he made a big deal of going outside of the business to take off his mask and pay outside.

I don‚Äôt know much people that call themselves victims from someone cat calling them or touching their ass especially since this happens to most people (especially women) quite often. Just as a lot of people don‚Äôt call themselves assault survivors when someone with road rage yells at them. So it seems like your talking about a small population lol.

I took a look at her bill and found out she was paying for service that doesn‚Äôt even run off that particular modem! They said they‚Äôre needs to be a request made online to get a new one.
