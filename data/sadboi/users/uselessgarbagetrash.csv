Its depression, it doesn't care who it hurts
No money, rich, gay, straight, disabled or not disabled, you can be depressed and it's a perfectly valid feeling.

Sure, environments and situations can increase your chance of becoming depressed, like, if you developed a chronic illness or if you were homeless,or if you lost a parent. But that doesn't make them more 'worthy ' of being depressed because its a real illness affecting so many people. 

I'm here if you ever want to chat about things. :)"

The way I personally cope is by thinking that even if I can't be happy, maybe other people can. So I just help others as much as I can. Like, fuck me, I'm never gonna be happy

Im 14 and I'm on holiday in London right now, I live in Yorkshire. 
I've been panicking for the last couple of days all day cause I'm bad with crowds, and I'm really socially anxious. Not going to lie, I've had to go on quite a lot of trains/undergrounds and stuff, and being near the tracks is making pretty nervous. I don't think I'd actually do it but yk it's just scary. 

How are you?"
