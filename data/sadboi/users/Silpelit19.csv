2. I'm sorry about the therapist asking you for a direct answer about suicide. Unfortunately they have to do that even if they know its a shitty thing to do. If someone is a danger to themselves they have to report it. That said, I think some of them try to ask it in a way where its like they are saying ""I have to ask you this but as long as you say it its ok even if you dont mean it"". Like, lets just get this formality out of the way so we can actually work on improvement."

SuicideWatch,fppzkrf,t3_gen4q2,1588812218.0,"Being a young teenager there are a lot of uncontrollable emotions that tend to amplify what you are feeling. It feels shitty for everyone who was at that age. but it doesnt mean its not real or that it should just be ignored.

The most important thing for you is to have someone to talk to. Therapists are great, strangers online are not always that great lol. try to see a therapist if you can, you would need your parents approval for this typically and hopefully your parents are understanding.

That said, there are some things i could tell you that i wished I had known when i was a teenager.

Even if you feel like you are garbage or weak, exercise daily. even just a little. your brain rewards you with those feel good chemicals when you regularly exercise and stay fit. you might feel depressed and weak and exercise is just too hard when you are so down but you need to push through and do it anyways otherwise it gets worse and worse The same goes for eating, studying, chores, school work. 

they all feel like such a bother and that they won't bring you happiness. maybe that's true, but NOT doing it will definitely make everything feel worse. trust me getting used to a proper work ethic will make your life so much less stressful, and you are going to need that skill all the way through college. if you don't keep up with school work you will ALWAYS have stress and anxiety. school work might not make you happy but it saves you a lot of stress to just do it and get it over with. Laziness breeds depression, lets it fester. and its exhausting being anxious every second of every day. being tired isnt just a physical thing, your mind under heavy constant stress makes you tired too. it is the equivalent to jogging all day. work, study, eat, exercise, do it all and you avoid a lot of stress, that stress is what makes you so exhausted.

you know that saying 'money doesn't buy happiness'? its bullshit. Financial stability relieves SO MUCH stress. it works the same with grades, exercise, etc. do those things enough to not make them additional anxieties and you will feel a lot better about yourself. its not necessarily the activity that makes you happy but it's the relief of the stress you would have that makes you happy.

but again, talk to someone. a professional. just because you have teenage emotions doesnt mean it wouldnt help to see a specialist."

Honestly one of the best things a mod could do for you is keep a list of names that they can block from the channel entirely.

Like everyone else said, it does not matter what you do, whether you are a successful youtube channel or not, whether you are pretty or not, there will always be hate because that is just how viewers are. There are groups of people who get together in forums and combine their numbers to try and tear down humble channels just trying to have fun.

Think of it like if someone posted your photo to the roast me subreddit. They make it their mission to destroy you. It doesn't matter if they think you are attractive or smart or anything, they will tear you down. Luckily that sub requires verification.

SuicideWatch,fn86zpd,t1_fn81hzf,1586735245.0,"to build off this, there are exercises people can do ti help with these intrusive thoughts. regardless of what the thought might be. Some are explained better in the book I mentioned but the key basis is these steps:

Relabel - you label the intrusive thought as exactly what it is. an intrusive thought, it is not you, it is trying to trick you into thinking it is you.

Reattribute/reframe - change your perception of the deceptive brain message. You tell yourself ""it is not me, it is OCD"". Some people feel better saying it out loud when they can (me included).

Refocus - Direct your attention to something else. The intrusive thought will crowd your mind but try and do something that keeps you busy and productive to take your mind off it. (this is hard for me when I am bored with nothing to do...)

Revalue - Clearly see the thought or urge for what it is: a deceptive brain message that is not true and not you. it has no value or weight.

You follow these steps as much as you can, write them down, read them to yourself out loud, and tailor the steps to your thoughts and personalize them."
SuicideWatch,fn7xyk4,t1_fn69jga,1586729880.0,"before you solidify that fear, see a professional about OCD or read the book/audio book ""Brain Lock"". It directly addresses the fear of being a pedophile in OCD patients.

And its also best to do meds in combo with therapy.

That said, ""Brain Lock"" is a very good book/audio book to learn about OCD and what you can do about it. It sounds silly but it helps you to realize that you can rewire your brain to challenge these obsessive thoughts. and this works for ALL types of OCD. The fear of being a pedophile is directly addressed in this book as well.

Another good one is the OCD Workbook."
