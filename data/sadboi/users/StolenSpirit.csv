Ubiquiti,fr22xqw,t1_fr1zrzf,1589830243.0,"The one main thing that's making this decision rather hard (I've been researching it for 2 months now) Is not only the usability factor, GUI, functionality, but cost as well. The Ubiquity products appear more ideal in the sense that you know what you're getting because the hardware is directly from the company. With PFsense sure you have the Netgate offerings which the cheapest of which is around $200 and doesn't seem to get good reviews due to its processor and lack of ram. I then started to scour Amazon and building your own PFsense mini device and seems to check all the boxes of needing Intel Lans (their community really seems to hate Realtek) , it has to be a newer Intel chipset with AES-ni instructions capability, and with all that there are 3rd party offerings such as the Protectelli ones on Amazon, and Jetway by mITXpc (really expensive for the components inside easily $300 depending) and then something like the Fitlet2 which I've narrowed down to the one I'd get if I were to go with PFsense, $200 for the barebones E3950 version, then the m.2 SSD, and ram which has to be a specific kind to be compatible. Even that comes out to $260 on Amazon before tax. The appeal of Ubiquiti is the EX-R is $60 and the Edgerouter Lite is $130. Much cheaper in every way."

I’ve swiped past girls I’ve had a “situationship” with where we had our one point in life seeing each other and for whatever reason not working out before it becomes a relationship. But I know they’re out there struggling too cause they keep remaking their accounts on all the dating apps. Then you have the total unicorns that you match with and are totally new to dating apps and you hit it off and still don’t end up winning and getting played. Shit sucks.

asktrp,fm6c3rd,t3_fsqr6f,1585790791.0,"Turning 27 this month and with 30 on the horizon I feel like life’s already over. Greatest hits were definitely late teens early 20s, didn’t see it back then of course. Every woman past 27 looks ridden hard and dating in your 30s with woman at that age is a straight boner kill. None of them look appealing. Everyone here seems to praise their 30s as being some new chapter of their inevitable ending up alone life, which I can see I’ll end up. You can dress up in your head that it’s going to be great but truth is your heading into old and balding territory. But I get it, for the sake of masking the depression gotta look happy on the outside. Young romances are the best, ultimately they make up your defining moments in your life. If you don’t meet and stay with someone when your in your 20s everything else is damaged goods. If I had any spine I’d off myself in hopes I could relive my youth or another and do it differently with a better social upbringing, and more supportive environmental factors that were outside of my control- or even just not making some the mistakes when I had it good it would of been a different future forsure. Best not to dwell on that shit, it’s not “TRP” way. But deeply engraved personality flaws are unfixable, and can’t be unbound. In a world where everything is boring and bland, organic new relationships just don’t happen."

PFSENSE,fm1c9zo,t1_fm1bsw4,1585675819.0,"Oh wow, but on the other hand the 9400F is very power efficient. It's always nice to have more if you need it even if its not currently utilized. Thats the benefit of the newer processors, the older ones are less efficient and cost more to keep up and running 24/7, taking a hit to your electric bill. That's why I'm leaning away from refurb but the sheer power to price ratio is really so hard to pass up on some of these Dell Workstations on Amazon."

Maybe I'll see if I can hop on NewEgg and order it again."

That place is crazy busy now with all that's going on.

One of the companies was a huge transport company in their headquarters, and going into the interview I already knew something was up (this is me also working in IT currently at a school district that is now shut down for 8 weeks-perhaps more now) There was literally no one in all the offices, and so quiet you could hear a pin drop. I was pretty oblivious as was everyone else in Early March thinking it wouldn't hit them on a personal level but then when it does, its like nothing else. Hopefully (seriously hopefully) the economy bounces back from this, but man I fear there's going to be another recession because of all this."
