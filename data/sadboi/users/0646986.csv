You need at least 1/4 cup of stems, I like to grind them up as well before boiling them.

Then while boiling you add your binding agent (alcohol, butter, or milk). The type of binding agent you use determines when you add it to the stem solution. 

I let it simmer for like 30 min, strain it, then pour it over a tea bag in a tea cup :)
