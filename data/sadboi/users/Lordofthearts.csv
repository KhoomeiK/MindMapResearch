Tinder,f9fmuiv,t1_f9dnfj7,1575279561.0,"You're making an assumption about ""females"" as you stated. If this guy already has dating troubles telling him to ""be careful, females don't even know what they want"", will not help him, it's not a healthy view to have."
Tinder,f9dfcbq,t1_f9cl1pg,1575233007.0,"I'm glad you know woman better than they do. I have a lot dating experience, most PEOPLE don't know what they want. Don't make it a gender thing."
MrRobot,f9deb4m,t1_f9c29ui,1575232693.0,Is it hard walking around without a sense of humour?
Routine,f92sgai,t1_f8zxpdi,1575040502.0,"Of course it matters? You can't just ignore all the factors because it's convenient for you. If you gave 2 studios the same level of skill, but only 1 had the resources of a major studio, who would be more likely to succeed?

Cyberpunk had zero footage and was only something we were told by CD Projekt Red. We literally haven't seen a thing and only have heard of its existence (at the time) vs. a 2 full trailer, 2 missed release dates, complete radio silence multiple times, a startup company with 3 people... These situations are nothing alike."
Routine,f8xvmid,t1_f6hbvah,1574936179.0,"What? One game is being made by a proven successful studio and one is made by 3 people... get a grip dude lol  
Denial is a helluva drug."

darksouls,f17n698,t3_d80sui,1569245473.0,"It will turn into a garbage dump of crap, sure we could get some good stuff. Most of it will just big down the good text posts because want to look at something for 2 seconds and move along. I enjoy all the personal stories and triumphs from people, vids and pics would most definitely wreck that."

trashy,eyuap8y,t1_eytnctq,1567457213.0,"As a non-Christian, how do you turn a blind eye to God condoning rape, genocide, slavery and war in the Old Testament? I'm serious, I don't know how anyone who believes in the Old Testament can look at God and think , ""what a chill dude, sign me up!"""

PrequelMemes,erzpv3n,t1_erzladw,1561445456.0,"My mistake there, good sir. I think I'm still going to stay away from EA regardless. How long have they had the Star Wars license? They haven't really done... anything of note with it. I wish a company who actually gave a shit had it."
PrequelMemes,erylcbd,t1_erwl4tm,1561411182.0,"Then you go for it. I won't buy this shit on principle. There's much more deserving games of my money. Especially ones who aren't so transparent about ripping people off.  Loot boxes are just as bad as microtransactions imo, not to mention if you can buy loot boxes for small incremental amounts, they have now been turned into microtransactions."

""I thought 1 or 2 days a week was good enough."" Refering to hanging out and maybe being a little more there for me.

Oof. No longer consider this person a close friend. Really painful to be honest. All well."
