At 1 point in my life I had 3 kids in diapers and it was HARD. You have a 4 month old and a 4 year old? Those are some hard years! Plus, everytime I added a new baby, that first year was just an adjustment year, where you are in survival mode. Dishes didn't get done, laundry piled up, I didn't get sleep, it felt very defeating, but if snuggling your baby and changing diapers and playing with a toddler is ""all you accomplished"", then you accomplished a lot. Newborns are demanding and have a constant physical and emotional need from you. 

Now my oldest is 12 and parenting is still a challenge, but the kids can dress themselves, pick up toys and help with chores. We have a small farm and they gather eggs, feed the chickens, etc, and it lightens my load. I currently have strep throat and my oldest made breakfast for all his siblings while I slept in a bit.

Just curious because there are other college towns that may offer the same opportunities with lower COL. Bzn is the most expensive city in Montana right now.

I think you bring up some great points about turning a passion into a job, and that absolutely CAN happen, but I don't get the idea that is the case with Sam. I think her mental illness is the reason she's unfulfilled. I have Bipolar Disorder and struggle BIGTIME with depression & anxiety. During the lowest times, even my greatest passions become a struggle, my job (an oil & watercolor artist) & hobbies (skiing, camping, hiking, reading, running, photography), which I love, become entirely unfulfilling because my brain is sick. Life becomes bland, simple tasks like brushing my fucking teeth become overwhelming, and nothing feels worth living for. I've spent the past 15 years getting new jobs, switching careers to make me happy or to find something I love. But ultimately it came down to trying to resolve my mental health disorder, because when I am healthy and in a good state of mind, my passions become fulfilling again. I think if she gets a good combo of the right meds and continues working on her mental health, youtube and makeup will start to become a passion, again.

I made sure his house was clean by scheduling a housekeeper, pool maintenance, window cleaning, carpet cleaners, etc. I often ordered or cooked him lunch.

Laura says this is her most requested video and says she's going to answer questions and share some intimate and personal details on why she adopted her niece.

She starts by sharing some of her background, saying she grew up in a chaotic household and her dad was an alcoholic, there was domestic violence and they were very low income and lived often with the lights off. Of the 3 siblings, Laura's older sister handled the family situation the hardest.

When Laura's sister was 16 she got pregnant. Laura is 2 years younger than her sister and was 14 at the time. The teen pregnancy was a major factor in her parent's divorce. Laura, her sister, mom & the new baby moved into a small apartment and they went from low income, to poverty and things got worse from there.

Laura's relationship with her sister now is in a good place now, but has always been up and down and somewhat strained.

Laura lost her dad 3 years ago to addiction and says addiction has always been a huge part of her life and is the reason they adopted Eryn.

She then calls her sister so she can tell her story:

Her sister says being a teen mom was hard, she dropped out of school & had to get a job and being a single mom was very challenging. She said she never thought she'd become an addict and because she watched addiction ruin her dad, she didn't think she'd take that path, but stated addiction doesn't discriminate. It is a disease and in her case she thinks that in her case, it may have been hereditary. After their dad died, the addiction and drug use got worse and she was very close to going to federal prison, which was a wakeup call for her.

Her sister expresses gratitude for Laura and Tyler taking Eryn. She said she doesn't know what she would do without family and there are so many kids that end up in foster care and the system because of this and is just grateful and thankful that Laura & Tyler decided to step in and raise her daughter.

She encourages people who are in her shoes to stick with recovery and it's not an easy road.

Eryn shares her side:

She said life was pretty good until 6th grade. Her mom & dad started fighting, her parents got a divorce, and then they moved in with Eryns grandma. Soon after, her mom started using and became an addict. Eryn's grades started going downhill and she started skipping school. Eryn's grandma had a hard time raising and controlling Eryn, which is essentially when Laura and Tyler decided to take Eryn in.

Laura shares that her lifestyle has really changed. She used to be selfish and be focused on work, social media and travelling and now her & Tyler's focus is their family. They take Eryn to and from school, help with homework and establish set rules for Eryn. She went from a failing student to now an honor student. They really focused on giving her a stable home environment with accountability, support and structure.

MY OWN THOUGHTS:I know LL is controversial here and personally I don't support or watch her normally, but I will say I have enormous respect for what Laura and Tyler did for their niece. Eryn seems super happy and I know how important stability is to break the cycle of addiction. I came from a home of addiction and was a heroin addict, myself, so watching this video was very emotional for me. I really appreciated how Laura let her sister and Eryn both speak for themselves and answer their own questions. I think it's good to bring awareness to addiction and reduce the stigma that surrounds it, which is why I posted this video."

BeautyGuruChatter,f18dvgr,t1_f16ples,1569256290.0,"There's shame all-around. I'm a full time SAHM that doesn't give AF about a ""side hustle"" and get shamed because ""that's all I do"" when I could be earning an income from home! I'm targeted all the time. Nope. I don't want to sell stuff, I don't want to join your brainwashed scheme. I just want to raise my kids and my farm animals. 

PS I love your family dynamic and how highly you spoke of your parents & childhood upbringing."
BeautyGuruChatter,f18dad4,t1_f16n5co,1569256050.0,"Exactly. Take Advocare for example - they just restructured their entire company and most distributors lost their downline and all their income. I have a lot of friends that were in the business. 3 had to sell their homes, 2 moved across the country to be with family, and ALL had to find new jobs/careers. I'm not happy this happened to them, but it's the very same reason I said NO when they all approached me to become a salesperson. It's a brainwashed shady scam that sells the illusion of ""you're your own boss!""."

This helps and I actually cleaned my kitchen today, which snowballed into doing some laundry, which snowballed into getting my living room dusted and mopped. It ended up being about a C+ type of day, instead of a total F. I have 5 young kids so things add up QUICKLY. It's always the first step that is the hardest and I always struggle with the discipline of just taking the first step."
