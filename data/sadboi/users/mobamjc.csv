NYCbike,esbpdj6,t3_c6khhd,1561805034.0,"what do you expect? not too long i got into an argument with a yellow cab about how he was obstructing bike lanes...told me he was waiting for a fair.  I waited and waited, no fair.  Cop came by, I showed him the issue...he saw it...responded ""I don't know what you want me to do.""  These are the reasons people are getting hurt or killed.  Drivers of deadly machinery aren't being held accountable.

I was hit by a yellow cab turning right on my green light on hudson river greenway this past tuesday.  Cop was in no rush to talk to the cabbie, just to me. ""You alright? you are? okay - you were moving a little quick, did you not see him turning.""  I reacted as I saw him make his initial turn. He had no blinker on and didn't check for bicyclists on the fucking greenway.  Cop then told me i had to have more spacial awareness but that is what actually kept me from being seriously injured.  I was able to walk away with a sore head (helmets are cool, guys...they look goofy but they cool).  Bike however was rushed to the ER
