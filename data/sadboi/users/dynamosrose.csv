...or, if I may be so bold as to suggest this: *Carter Slader ghost-riding in a movie set in the late 60s*.
 

  



  

 
  


 
...and finally, my own little idea: a movie starring a ranchhand  who goes by the name of *J.T. Slade* and receives the Spirit in whatever way while tending to a farm somewhere far out in the country. He stubbornly chooses to ride his trusty, terminally-ill steed until the very end of the film, when it does, but by then he's received a more practical and also not-terminally-ill vehicle of some kind.

Or fuck it let's have a film about Naomi Kale. That's what I want to see. If hers was a more commonly discussed Rider, I'd want to see that one explored more than any of the others."
