mentalillness,fnyno03,t1_fnyigsi,1587368975.0,"I'm 25, came across a post. Looked it up. Discribred me to a tee. I'm going to work on it more."

mentalhealth,fnr0hau,t3_g3f3pk,1587176347.0,"I haven't cried in years. Yes cried drunk a few times but that was drunk. Can't remember actually crying sober, I don't even remember the feeling tbh. I'm craving that burn in your eyes before the tears fall."
mentalillness,fnr069z,t3_g3ae1w,1587176141.0,"What's getting me through at this time is having the mind set, reminding myself. Everyone is in the same boat rn. Everyone is stuck up shit creek without a paddle. I don't know where you are in the World but I feel they'd take this situation & many others into consideration. I'm in the same boat but stuck interstate about to fail my accounting & Bookkeeping course because I haven't got reliable reception where I live to go online to study. I'll have to pay back around 5k.. I literally feel like dying rn. I'm 25 & I feel this is my last chance at success. But no here I go failing again. It's actually crushing me I don't no what to do but life goes on man."
mentalillness,fnqzfv0,t3_g34q2v,1587175658.0,"When I was 7-8 id run away from home, down to the phonebox & ring kids helpline. I spoke with a really nice lady for years until I was 16, then I rang one day & she didn't work there anymore. It actually depressed me more, not saying goodbye. I'm 25 in a few weeks & still think of 'Betty'. Random people that walk by in the street I wonder if that's her. I wonder if she's doing ok in life.... I feel it does more damage."
MentalHealthWatch,fnqywm2,t3_g2hke1,1587175300.0,That's not fair
MentalHealthWatch,fnqysup,t3_g2m7oq,1587175232.0,"I get you..  but your home is both your home. I'm sure you could figure something out, is it the fact your want to be ALONE AT HOME or is it that she bugs you while recording etc ?"
MentalHealthWatch,fnqygbz,t3_g2y57n,1587175006.0,"Being a people pleaser, I'm one my self. Took me years to get away from the feeling. I came across this vid on YouTube, forgot the name. But it was explaining how each individual has multiple faces/multiple versions of themselves. Not in a fake way either. Like understanding that & studying that really helped me, getting into the law of attraction also. Yes sounds completely off topic but it help me understand the whole thing."
mentalhealth,fnqxytb,t3_g3c7yf,1587174683.0,"I've got long hair so that getting mattered is the only thing motivating me to shower rn... Why ... Not going to go out, socialise, be normal. What's the point."
mentalhealth,fnnf7xe,t3_g2nwfz,1587090987.0,"Don't, I can't talk much without being a hypocrite just don't."
mentalillness,fnnaldv,t3_g2q35w,1587088046.0,"I am in the same predicament. I don't even think the meds are working anymore , due to the fact of having to go out/socialise, do good. But can't ... I was kicked out by my mother on the 12th of March. I have a4yo son. Moved back in with her to get some support a step up. For once . The placeiwas with my son's dad just didn't offer anything'better' to achieve in life. So I took the offer. Now I'm in a even worse situation. I can't see a way out. Why did my toxic parent have to do me like this. I regret & hate myself because im an idiot for thinking she would help. All my supports are toxic. I feel I shouldn't be here."
mentalillness,fnna3ii,t3_g2ldso,1587087734.0,Because we are being forced into being some we aren't from birth.

mentalhealth,fml7byo,t3_fvyug4,1586180380.0,"This is too familiar, this is me. I have a similar post up. The complete same but different. I'm at the point where it's like wtf....."
mentalhealth,fml6i1m,t3_fvyqdd,1586179808.0,"0 friends, yes go make some... I did try that & found my in a ' wrong place wrong time' situation. Which I'll never recover from, f**ked my life. Not 100% but close! So that's a no go for me, at this point & time I do hope I do recover."
mentalhealth,fmkru8m,t3_fvtqlu,1586166175.0,"Just be that listening ear. Don't take it upon yourself to help, did they ask? Most likely not. Constructive criticism. 

All some ever wanted was to have an ear or shoulder to cry on. Most of the time know what to do, the steps to take, some  need to use 'venting' as a way to push in the right direction & not just pushing it off the the side."
