I will check out that term!

Finding a ocd specialist is impossible since there is none in my country (I have checked and so did a fellow redditor as well). Can I confess something? I'm not looking forward to return to therapy. My therapist seems fed up with me and began to repeat the same speech. ""you are doing it again. You have to face your fears"" I will bet she will do the same if i bring her this subject. She also makes me uncomfortable with her personality. She's too extra for me. And I can't change therapists because oh boy my parents. Hahaha.

I'm obsessing over that particular fantasy (the one with fictional blonde lady) and like I said, I didn't mean to fantasize about teens, if it happened... It's just that I don't know what adults, teens and children look like because I don't notice them... Does it make sense? Also, to me, it's so hard to give age to someone... I'm 23 so I come from a generation where teens looked like... Teens! Now, some 15 yo look older than me (I've had tons of people think I am still a minor). 

I don't remember what happened 2 years ago... I really don't... I wish I had so I wasn't guessing what happened. All I know is that even then she didn't stay the same... There were frame, during the same fantasy, where she had brown straight hair with a longer face. (shrugs) I think all of this is just manifesting as a twisted attack to my shame from my ocd and internalized homophobia.

I'm glad you don't suffer from my particular type of ocd. It's hell. But it's normal to have intrusive thoughts about this during vulnerable moments, specially when we are using our imagination but this was during a good period of my ocd where ""I didn't think I was p"" that's why this scares me more...

I'm almost ace... Not completely and I don't know if you know the term ""demisexual"" but that is what I use to describe a mid term between ace and sexual (???).

My fantasies were only to prepare myself for the future (if that ever happened). I'm terrified of seeing someone naked and touching... And it did help me overcome some of my fears but now, I only feel like a pervert or a predator... Please don't think I consider anyone else a pervert!! I'm only judge myself!! In fact, I think it's normal to other people, it just feels wrong if I do it.

It's worth to mention that in most of my fantasies, I was fully dressed... As if I didn't deserve affection and I'm incredibly ashamed of my body.

I'm unhappy... I've hated myself longer than I remember. I feel disgusting in my skin since I was a kid. I feel gross all the time and dirty... I don't have the compulsion of over cleaning because it won't ever wash away my dirtiness away... As much as I want to stay alive I don't know if I am strong enough to fight...

Whenever I think about people who actually hurt children (I will avoid the name), I think ""maybe I'm one of them"", ""maybe I should go to prison or die"". I look back to that moment and remember feeling nauseated after the day was over, wondering if her parents thought I was weird for playing with their child. I remember feeling guilty for battling those thoughts when I should had simply avoid the child as much as possible. I felt guilty but at the same time I felt I had no reason for it because I didnt think I had done anything wrong... In my head, my mind was simply fooling me. I wasn't a p! That's silly... But right now I can't stop feeling nauseated like I felt during the day and I wonder ""was I feeling guilty about something I did?"" because if I did have romantic feelings for the child, maybe I should had stayed away from her.... Maybe I shouldn't had held her.

I will try to do as you say... I'm not looking for reassurence because... I don't feel reassured anymore. In fact when people say ""it didn't happen"" I get worse because I am afraid of letting them down.

It's hell and its so early in the day and I don't want to be alive and hurting..."
OCD,foc5jrt,t1_foaj30f,1587667357.0,"Thank you... You are very kind my friend... This comment made me smile...

To use your metaphor, I'm so afraid I shook the tree so the acorn would hit the other person's head... I'm afraid I hurt the child on purpose...

The idea of having harm anyone it's awful, specially a child. That's why I am so fixated on this. I don't think I wanted to harm her or touch her inappropriately (because I have never done that to anyone)"
OCD,foc4l3k,t1_foc0guq,1587667034.0,"Yeah... I know ... To be honest, I have been trying to do it on my own... I'd rather have some help/assistance/company. I wouldn't feel as scared."

I hope you are right. I hope these were all just thoughts... That event makes me sick everytime I think about it. I try to review it over and over in my head but I don't remember the details and I feel anxious. The worse part of it is the pool where I created that horrible false memory (the pool one) ... I want to believe I didn't do anything because I don't remember having intentions of touching inappropriately but who knows?? Honestly, I don't know what to do... I've talked with my therapist about this! She dismisses and moves on to something else because ""we already talked about it"". I'm in great distress...

Hopefully, I will get over it one day.... I have already overcome a few false memories involving my dog. (not 100% but i try not to think about it)

The masturb- one makes me also sick... I don't know if it happened or not...

I will tell you... I am so tired... And I feel so guilty. What if any of my fears happened? Do I deserve to die?

Yes, I do..."

It sucks, I know... I'm really sorry. I am currently suffering from fixation over a past event and whether or not what I did was OK and some parts of it, are blurred so I always assume that I did the worse possible thing and I haven't feeling well..."

I can imagine your pain and suffering though. I don't know what type of symptoms/OCD your child has (there's so many).

First of all, I want you to understand that it's not your children's fault. OCD is an exaggerated fear of something. My parents tell me that I do this on purpose and it hurts me so much and makes everything harder to deal with. So when disciplining them, remember about that.

Please follow the doctor's orders... If your child needs medication, please do it. Talk with the doctor about it and tell them your worries and ask them for explanations about a certain drug.

Maybe try seeking online therapy. There's a association that might help you. They help everyone internationally. It's called ocdaction.

I wish you the best of luck!"

Despite me not accepting, I want you to know how grateful I am for your help... I truly cried. You made my day.

I also want you to know that I am not poor. I have saved money. Money I never touched but money I have access to. I am a grown up but my dad wouldn't let me get a credit card. That's why I don't have access to any online resources.

My parents aren't supportive and think I'm making this on purpose. I can't tell them that my therapist no longer helps or they would be pissed.... I'm so sorry for the rambling.

What you're describing is what I am trying to do. 8 don't feel like a ""p"" as much but... The story I linked still gives me peaks of anxiety. I sometimes can't sleep over whether or not I did something wrong. I want to believe that not happening but a painful chill on the back makes me question it.

I'm really sorry for worrying you... I haven't been able to sleep in last couple of days. I have horrible nightmares that make fear of falling asleep and make me wake up in the middle of them. My parents know this and yet they keep waking me up at 1 pm... It was so hard to fall asleep... I fell asleep after 7 pm. And I'm so tired... I'm so sorry for the venting. I just wanted to explain my painful night."

I'm really sorry if a comment slipped because I try to read them all... But honestly, it's hard because my reddit app (what I use) doesn't warn me of everything and tells me that I have more messages and comments than what I receive or can see.

Edit: I searched a lot and I found a comment of a person with a similar user name as yours asking me if I wanted a book. I'm so sorry for not replying. I truly didn't notice your comment. I could never accept someone to buy me things.... I couldn't. But I appreciate your offer"

Thank you... I can't tell you enough how grateful I am. I apologize for being overdramatic but I am in a bad spot right now. I have no therapy right now nor access to one...

Don't feel pressured to respond to this mess of a reply but I wanted to properly reply to you. 

About your first paragraph, yes. You are right. I tend to try to hate myself even though it's so painful. For this particular subject and a few others, I always tend to go back to them to hyper focus when I have been overly happy in the last few days. Deep down, I know that I don't deserve the hapiness and good things I have. This happens a lot with my girlfriend - she's the best thing that ever happened to me. She's my angel, my love... She's the reason why I still fight. She knows about this subject and like you said, she was the one who went through every detail and tell me that what I did is normal and that I didn't do anything wrong. She knows that this is a topic that brings me great distress and she often tells me that ""I'm loved. I'm needed""; that ""she won't go anywhere or give up on me"". Despite my ups and downs in thinking whether I'm a ""p"" or not, I'm *always* afraid I fantasized with children... And that if that is true, she would leave me. Does it make sense? I'm crying in panic as I write this... - Because, the fact that I fantasized with ladies with sweet/child-like personalities, frightens me to consider the possibility that I have a ""thing"" for at least young teens (14-16) that are sexually inexperienced... (and like I said in my post, I always told my head that they were the same age as I).

Oh gosh... You hit the nail on that one (I'm sorry if this is the wrong expression to use. English is my second language). I'm so ""innocent"" and ""dumb"" on these things... I'm 23 and this girlfriend I keep mentioning is my first one (and last) romantic partner and we've been dating for a year. We are thousands of miles away from each other and I'm inexperienced in everything from romance and sexual intimacy. I'm a virgin. I never kissed before. Before I continue, I want to say that our relationship is a healthy one in my perspective. Some people have rolled their eyes on me thinking that it wouldn't last because of [insert every problem with long distance relationships]. The only hard thing in our relationship is my OCD and being so far away from her and wanting to be near her. Don't get me wrong, I want affection but just her affection and the long distance doesn't change my feelings for her. Despite not being physically there, we try our best to be supportive of each other. We talk to each other every day and I make her feel loved and appreciated in every possibility I can. It's an mature relationship and an healthy one if I may so myself. I don't know if I had this to the original post but I never received affection and it caused me a severe lack of childhood development and it's the base cause of my OCD (this was said by my therapist).

I'm so afraid of intimacy for a long number of reasons. I will try to explain them without being overbearing. You are right about the religious background but it influenced me in a different way. I had a mild religious background. I ""am"" catholic. My country is catholic. I had catechism for 4 years. I have an aunt who is a nun. But in fact, I became agnostic... However, I sometimes pray to God for forgiveness for what I have done and request them to take my life sometimes. Despite being agnostic, my religious backgrounds were never gone. The religion shaped me, yes. But in a different way that you may think of. My parents never told me that sex was wrong or anything like that... I just assumed. I was seen as a pure child by everyone - parents, teachers, other children. And it was easy to be like that until my sexual desire changed... And I started wanting intimacy (mildly) .... To be honest, for a few years, I didn't think it was wrong (it was only recently - a few months ago, I started to go back into my ""I don't want s-x""). But it was always a limbo for me. ""maybe I shouldn't want these things"" I thought to myself, it just got huge after my OCD exploded. Another huge thing is the *hate* I feel for my body.... I was also diagnosed with depersonalization disorder (let's say, I hated my body) and the thought of my girlfriend touching my gross, disgusting body scares me so much... I don't know how to explain this...

About my shameful fantasies, I wanted to add that, back then, *when the fantasies occured*, I didn't consider the possibility that I was being a predator. I certainly had the thought that maybe I was fantasizing with people younger than me, but I thought that it was my head fooling me and that I wasn't doing anything wrong...... Does it make sense? I wish I had listened to my head... It was warning me that I'd later regret my fantasies. That what I was doing, was indeed wrong....

I'm so sorry if nothing of this made sense. I truly appreciated your message though. Thank you once again.

Oh! I almost forgot. I definitely touched this subject with both my first and second psicologists but I still didn't have the opportunity to talk in depth about it."

I'm in a similar situation. Yesterday was my 1st year anniversary with my girlfriend and she's an angel.

I never thought someone would love me... I am ugly, boring, dumb, failure and a loser... - the major points! I thought no one would like me... I also suffer from OCD and I can't have children because of my poor genetics. I thought I was doomed to be alone... That I would be a lonely girl forever... And I had accepted ever since I was a teen

She appeared in my life, out of the blue... Honestly, it was I who approached her. I wanted to be friends with her and after a few months, I started to like her but I never thought the opposite would happen so I didn't give too much thought.

She thinks I'm pretty, smart and interesting... She is there for me when my ocd is stronger and she is so so kind and intelligent, like... I'm *way* out of her league. I don't deserve her in the slightest and yet I don't want to lose her to anyone.

I'm really happy for you. We all need a special someone in our lives."
