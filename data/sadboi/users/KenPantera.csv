I‚Äôm not a doctor but there was a time I thought my asthma out of control and later learned I have sleep apnea. I also get health anxiety about my asthma. So what would happen is I would stop breathing and wake up out of breath and then trigger a panic attack. 

If you have dreams you need to use your inhaler or are choking, are having headaches in the morning and feel tired or want to nap mid-day even though you slept all night - may want to rule out sleep apnea."

I specifically get anxious with police knocking since it stirs up childhood memories of my dad being arrested multiple times. Even the sound of the radios sets me off. 

I was in my apartment about a year ago and hear the knock and police announcement. They said they got a call and I was so nervous and they probably could tell. Anyway after questioning for a bit they tell me they got a call from the apartment and midway they reread the address... yep they got the wrong building. 

I was relieved but yeah - after they left I was a wreck and it was so stressful."

Anxiety,fku61e1,t1_fktfjmb,1584543008.0,I would recommend going to r/asthma and checking out the thread by someone who has mild asthma like it seems your mom has and got covid-19. She‚Äôs giving daily updates and said it wasn‚Äôt as bad as other asthma flare ups. It helped me out a lot since I‚Äôm really anxious being asthmatic myself.
Anxiety,fkt3esr,t1_fks35f6,1584505141.0,"I get this feeling when I have anxiety attacks. I try to catch myself when I first feel this way and say it aloud to myself or my partner. This way I‚Äôm not trying to run away from it. Then I start circle breathing. 

I‚Äôve found that if I call it out without being embarrassed or ashamed - making myself feel like it‚Äôs okay if I do have an anxiety attack right now - that usually keeps me from having one. Brains are funny and complicated."
Anxiety,fkt37fs,t3_fkayil,1584504979.0,"Yes! I‚Äôve been coughing to try to make sure I can get any imagined chest congestion out. In addition I‚Äôm nervously clearing my throat. The more stressful I feel the more I do it. 

The only thing that helps is gargling with salt water. I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve made my throat sore from clearing and coughing. 

Sorry you are all going through this but glad to know I‚Äôm not alone. In fact - we‚Äôre probably the group of hyper vigilant people who will actually practice social distancing and hand washing which in itself probably makes us less likely to catch this versus the folks going out for no reason."
Anxiety,fkqkujp,t1_fkppxt2,1584449027.0,"I hear you. My ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù show up if I‚Äôm really anxious or haven‚Äôt had enough sleep. If I‚Äôm in that state of mind, relaxation breathing just makes me more aware of my breath. 

So, if you do need to relax during those times I have found it helpful to close my eyes and do circular breathing - breathing in for 4 second, holding for 4 seconding, breathing out for 4 seconds and then repeating. As I count, I focus on the bottom of my feet and what they feel like or I focus on the space between my eyebrows and what that feels like, or the space between my nostrils."
Anxiety,fkqjjas,t1_fkq9vyd,1584447912.0,"Asthmatic here who was just panicking about having it about an hour ago when I just woke up. I was fighting some sinus congestion and it probably drained down and I had a little congestion in my chest. I could hear a little wheeze. I was kind of freaking out but after some deep coughing I got it out and no wheeze. 

In my head I convinced myself I have it even though I have no fever or aches or anything else. I don‚Äôt have a constant cough because I can‚Äôt help it - rather I‚Äôm coughing more when I read news about this thing because I get anxious and hyper aware of my chest and lungs. 

Just know that others are going through this and your mind may also pull the trick on you that you have it but it hasn‚Äôt fully developed yet -  but just take it one day at a time. Play a game or watch a video to take your mind off stuff and set a random alarm in the middle of it. Then check in and notice if your symptoms have disappeared."
Anxiety,fkpqy5a,t1_fkognfs,1584416923.0,"While I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having anxiety about spreading this - good job on recognizing your mild conditions. In reality I‚Äôm probably just a mild asthmatic too. I don‚Äôt have to take corticosteroids daily and really the only impact is that when I get a cold it usually goes to my chest for a few days. But - I have trouble not thinking about catching it and ending up on a ventilator or intubated. I‚Äôve never had to do that - another reason I‚Äôm not more than mild asthmatic. 

It is so hard to reason with anxiety!"
Anxiety,fkpqmoz,t1_fkokif4,1584416684.0,"I would say get a thermometer if possible to ease your anxiety - but I will say that I have health anxiety and felt feverish a few times in the last few days - even feeling my forehead to be extra warm when I touched it....

Anxiety,fkjhnl8,t1_fkjd630,1584246211.0,One option may be to see if they have a service where you can order online and they hand it to you in the parking lot when done. It could be a way to minimize anxiety and avoid seeing anything in the store that could set off anxiety.

Anxiety,fkdjki4,t1_fkcz5a4,1584081270.0,"I have asthma and feel the same way you do a lot. It comes in waves and I do have this feeling that if I catch it - I will die from it. I‚Äôm also having ‚Äúchest congestion‚Äù that is probably just throat congestion from all my throat clearing and the dry air of my apartment is probably drying out my sinuses. 

I want to feel safe again too - but knowing others are feeling this way too helps. I‚Äôm early 30s so you def. remember 9/11 ‚Äî that‚Äôs kind of what that felt like except we didn‚Äôt have reddit then. So I‚Äôm grateful there‚Äôs this community to share and focus on any good news. 

I‚Äôve found confronting the frightening feeling and sitting with it for a few minutes can help demystify it vs. racing thoughts about the implication of the thing you can‚Äôt tell yourself or face. I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense but - it is kind of like not touching our faces now. When I get an itch I will focus on it but not avoid it and note that I can choose to acknowledge it and ignore it, that it will pass.

I am in the middle of a game of Pandemic Legacy where the outbreak was in China. We started played sometime in the summer and over 4-5 games it has spread through most of the world - in many of the same countries. 

I joked about a month ago with my partner when reports of covid-19 ramped up that we needed to finish the game to make the word right. Now it‚Äôs too triggering and bleak to bust it out and play. But we will have time and I‚Äôll report back on how it goes."

One thing that helped me was noticing the ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù go away when I am focused on a video game or something other than the news. Also- I‚Äôm not coughing at night and my throat is better in the morning - indicating that any soreness is due to excessive throat clearing from stress. That‚Äôs helped me.

Anxiety,fkcjdia,t1_fkc74b2,1584054328.0,"I‚Äôm sorry you are feeling that way. I was having similar symptoms yesterday. I had some sinus pressure which made me panic and when I‚Äôm anxious about my chest/lungs (I‚Äôm an asthmatic) I will start coughing and clearing my throat nervously. 

Yesterday I was really low on sleep too which made me more anxious without me realizing it. I did read that if you‚Äôre not coughing throughout the night - it is likely anxiety. So this morning when I woke up and realized there was no soreness or coughing through the night - it helped me hang on to that and lower my anxiety. 

As I‚Äôve been reading about things today sure enough I‚Äôve started clearing my throat again. Hearing about others going through this too helps me feel like I‚Äôm not in this alone. Thanks for sharing and I hope your therapy appointment goes well!"

If you have insurance and have an emergency surgery that‚Äôs hundreds of thousands of dollars - you‚Äôre stop lossed at a few thousand. Of course that can set back people still but it isn‚Äôt as much of a burden. 

Now let‚Äôs say we roll out single payer. Do you think medical costs are going anywhere but up? Will the government set lower rates?

If so - what is the incentive for a doctor to be a primary care doctor instead of a specialist. We‚Äôre already seeing a shortage of primary care doctors. Will we all be see nurses for primary care?"
politics,evnmbd5,t1_evnlftx,1564627665.0,"It‚Äôs my understanding that the ACA protects against this. So right now you can‚Äôt be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. 

There are government programs that pay out insurers based on risk if they happen to have more sick members than a competitor - this incentivizes insurers to learn a bunch about their members and get undiagnosed ones to see a doctor.
