ADHD,fj1dly3,t3_fauxzu,1582917873.0,"I know exactly how you feel.  My brain is always running a million miles a minute, I've always got at least 5 projects going on at a time,  I'm in school 9 months out of the year, and unfortunately I also have to do Real People Things‚Ñ¢ like make dinner and do laundry and make sure my car doesn't run out of  gas.  I distinctly remember a period I went through a few years ago where I was baffled by how multi-facted life is.  I have to worry about personal goals AND school AND my friends and family AND housekeeping AND finding a job AND, AND, AND....it's a lot of shit.  To most people I guess it comes naturally (my whole family has ADHD so we sure as fuck wouldn't know) but the curse of ADHD is being painfully aware of a million things at once.  While our brains aren't naturally good at processing and organizing large swaths of info/concerns, I promise you that learning how to manage your shit does get easier, less scary, and less overwhelming the more you do it.  That isn't to say you'll ever get to a point where you feel like you e got it down pat -- I sure as hell haven't and I've been in this game nigh on 20 years.  You'll fuck up sometimes, or forget to add something to a list, or get overwhelmed, or try something that doesn't work.  And that's totally OKAY!  It's okay to mess up and fuck up.  It may feel overwhelming, but it's important to be able to pull back from whatever you're immediately tackling, take a deep breath, and spend a minute or two kindly asking the screaming anxiety monkey in your head to tone it the fuck down so you can make a grocery list (the monkey may not always listen, but it never hurts to try).  Here are the tips and tricks I've amassed over my life to try and keep everything from falling apart.  Also, if the formatting is fucked up its because I'm on mobile, sorry!

-- SCHEDULING: This has been one of (if not the) single most helpful tools I've found to stay on top of commitments to outside shit.  Your perfect planner will be different from mine, but at the end of the day, the planner should be small enough to carry with you at all times (in a purse, bookbag, etc), have both monthly and weekly pages, and have lots of space to write.  On the monthly pages, you write down day-of stuff: appointments, due dates, events, visitors, etc.  On the weekly pages, write day-of stuff at the top of the day it's due in pen (or anything that pops out really) and below it, write what you specifically needs to do that day in pencil, ex. go to the store, complete a specific assignment, etc.  I've found that only writing down things I absolutely have to do in my planner helps keep me from getting overwhelmed -- once I've done those things I know whatever I do with the rest of the day doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about it. 

-- ROUTINES: if making a routine is stressful, start with just one simple routine.  For example, your morning routine.  Begin by writing down only the things that absolutely have to be done before you leave your house or start your day in the morning -- in this example, stuff like brushing your teeth, eating breakfast, letting pets out if you have them.  Write these on a scratch sheet of paper just so you can see and evaluate the different steps.  Then, on a separate piece of paper, write them down again and label the paper with whatever routine it contains (feel free to decorate this one and make it pretty because you're gonna be looking at it every day).  Next, stick it in a place that you will be forced to view it at the relevant time.  For a morning routine, this may be on the inside of your bedroom door, your bathroom mirror, or even above your bed so it's the first thing you see.  Follow this simple routine for a week or so until you feel like you're comfortable in it, then you can go back and add in extra, non essential stuff to it -- following the morning routine example, maybe you add making your bed, or doing yoga, or sitting outside a few minutes.  The important thing to remember when adding stuff is that you don't have to craft the perfect morning or plan out your first 5 waking hours down to the minute.  In fact, if just sticking to the bare bones essential routine helps you feel less anxious, stick with that!  The important thing is to get stuff out of your head and onto something you can physically see and touch -- this way you don't have to remember it, or worry about forgetting it, and your body will have sense memories to attach to the shit you're doing.

-- HOBBIES: I still struggle with this.  Everytime I try to pick up something new it seems like entering a whole new galaxy of information that I have no idea how to parse and no idea how to get into without spending too much money because I know I'll probably be bored of it in a month.  One thing that has helped me not get so overwhelmed with new hobbies is starting with a goal or thing I want to achieve through that hobby.  For example, I want to get into gardening, but I suck shit at at and have no idea where to start.  So, I set the goal of making my own raised bed garden with some veggies in it.  Now, instead of looking into everything ever recorded about gardening, I just need to focus on (1) growing veggies and (2) raised garden beds.  Plus, I'm only making one, so if I decide gardening gives me emotional hemorrhoids and isn't my jam, I haven't wasted money on any and all gardening accoutrement I could ever need.  Not only that, but I don't have to worry about a million tangential unfinished projects, because I just have the one to work on.  Starting with a project in mind can help you focus on one outcome as opposed to the myriad of new and exciting ideas our ADHD brains are always happy to generate, and it also helps narrow the scope of information you need to focus on to get into whatever you're interested in.  Then, once you've finished, you've already got your foot in the door, some information in your pocket, and one product of your efforts on the books.  You also haven't made an investment so large that you can't pull out when you get bored.

-- TIMERS:  Timers are an absolute life saver.  I have timers telling me when to get up, when to leave for school, when to take my meds, when to wash my face, and when to get in bed and chill.  If it's something you need to do at a specific time and you're likely to forget about it, set a timer!  

-- TO-DO: this one may or may not help you out, but it helps me out.  I have a list-making app on my phone that always has at least the following three lists: what I need to accomplish that exact day, what I need to accomplish in the next month or so, and random ADHD blurbs.  To-do for that day contains only the essentials -- things that unless I'm somehow impaired (sick, severely depressed) are going to get done by the end of the day.  Having a daily to-do list helps reduce my ADHD related anxiety because I know I'm not forgetting anything (it's a pretty consistent list), and as soon as those things are done I can do whatever the fuck I want with the rest of my time and still live a functioning adult life.  The monthly to-do list should include essentials that must be completed in the next 3-5 weeks (ex. paying bills, booking an appointment, etc.) but can also include general, less vital goals, such as finishing a book, finishing or starting a personal project, or any other personal goal.  As you get more comfortable with using this list you can decide what you want to set as concrete, vital, will without-a-doubt be completed goals and which goals will be okay unmet in the next month.  The final list is just a list of whatever ideas strike me in the moment and are non essential, like maybe I want to remember to get I to woodworking at some point in my life, or remember to call my nana, or check out a new restaurant, etc.  This list helps me not worry about remembering all the cool shit I wanna get to eventually, because if it's on the list it doesn't have to be in my brain.

-- ABOUT THE PICTURES: I used to be the same way until I got Pinterest!  It may sound dumb but it really is a great way to organize and collect ideas.  The interface also makes it super easy to go through and delete old shit if you decide you don't wanna worry about it anymore   It's a great way to store/organize project ideas and inspiration.

At the end of the day, our brains are prone to generating and spotting way more information than we could ever begin to process, and freaking themselves out in the process.  Picking out the absolute bare essentials of whatever you're doing and getting comfy with them before adding more shit is the bet habit you can develop to combat getting overwhelmed.  I hope this helped!"

We barely missed a speed limit sign, and the field itself was so bumpy I was certain we were going to flip.  I didn't really process what was going on, it was like I wasn't receiving any sensory information except for one moment where I thought ""I'm going to die right now,"" and then everything went fuzzy again until I finally took my foot off the gas and we stopped.

SkincareAddiction,ffcge0k,t3_esoj3x,1579798887.0,"Okay, so I need help deciding if I should use an AHA or BHA.  I've read through most of the related info about hydroxy acids available on the wiki/sub, but I'm not sure which is right for me.  On the one hand, I've always had somewhat sallow/dull looking skin (never had that glowy dewy effect), I think it could help with some fine lines on my forehead (that haven't been affected by treating skin or general dehydration), I'm prone to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and I think it could also help with some.mild acne I've been struggling with.  On the other hand, AHAs aren't generally recommended for sensitive skin, and a BHA might help more with controlling my oily, acne prone sensitive skin.  I know you aren't supposed to use multiple actives at the same time, but could I maybe use an AHA one week and a BHA the next?  I have oily, acne-prone skin that gets drier and dehydration prone in the winter.  My acne is mostly closed comedones and little texture bumps along my jawline and forehead, but about once a month I'll get a small cyst that leaves a dark mark for a while."
SkincareAddiction,ff6o3v4,t1_ff69jrr,1579631330.0,"Some special treatments such as chemical peels or the hydrafacial you describe can leave the skin in a state that is a direct result of the treatment and therefore ok for a few days.  I.e., you shouldn't be trying to ""dry out"" pimples in your daily routine (and if your daily routine starts to leave your skin feeling dry after the effects of the facial have abated then you should consider changing it), but the woman who did your hydrafacial was likely just letting you know that the treatment may leave you feeling a little dry for a few days but you shouldn't try and treat that dryness since it is only temporary and will go away.  The best way to treat acne caused by excess oil is to make sure that your skin is getting the proper hydration it needs and not overproducing oil to compensate.  I hope this makes sense/helps!!"
SkincareAddiction,ff6nhf5,t1_ff6i5da,1579630955.0,"The wiki has an absolute plethora of information on anything you could possibly fathom wanting to know about skincare, so I would start there.

SkincareAddiction,fdred3i,t3_emm9jj,1578683322.0,"Hey y'all! I'll try to keep the background info to a minimum. On an earlier thread I explained that I recently went off the pill and got the Depo shot, which lead to the worst acne I've had since middle school all over my face, back and chest. I asked for advice and someone said it would be best to treat the problem at it's source and switch bc, and I have made an appt with my gp to do so but the earliest appt I could get isn't until the end of the month.  My actual question is: what can I do about my skin until then, or is it not worth worrying about?  I've got very oily/combo skin that's somewhat sensitive.  The acne is obvi hormonal and mostly manifesting as blackheads, little baby cysts, and an overall really bumpy texture.  Same on my back and chest.  I live in the Piedmont region of NC if anyone is familiar with that climate.

Routine (same for AM and PM):
Cleanser: Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser (cosrx)
Toner: Thayer's Witch Hazel Aloe Vera + Rose Petal toner
Moisturizer: Beauty 360 oil free moisturizer

Occasionally I'll use Proactive emergency blemish relief or the Mario basescu anti acne serum on spots.  I know I should probably use sunscreen more frequently but the only time I'm outside is walking to my car.  Occasionally I'll use the formula 10.0.6 papaya+citrus, strawberry+yarrow mask or the Aphrodite olive oil one.  Thanks!
