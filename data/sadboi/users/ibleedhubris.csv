As silly as it sounds I am attempting to take it right before I meditate with my singing bowls with some incense. I'm kind of hoping I can pavlov my brain chemistry as much of a stretch as it may be... ðŸ˜…"

CPTSD,feyttn3,t1_feys5u0,1579450423.0,"I am a veteran who was 'forced' out when symptoms of trauma while in service were too problematic; given their treatment of me before, during, and after service especially at ages of 17 through 21 (now 27) I have no intention of rushing back to any form of military or militarized system ðŸ˜…

Thankfully the VA covers me insurance wise it just means I have to self advocate a lot harder with my treatment direction as I don't exactly have the freedom or luxury of 'shopping around' or my medical team. Which is just greaaaat with the imposter syndrome and gaslighting issues. 

Thank you so much for your input! If anything even just knowing others are navigating simultaneous diagnosis like this is helpful."
CPTSD,feyqzpj,t1_feyq549,1579449508.0,I am struggling so much with this right now! It doesn't help that I have Cptsd triggers around my son as well ðŸ˜¢ so the added stress of basic executive dysfunction is horrible and shameful all at once especially when I can easily remember a time that I balanced everything so well just through mindfulness and proactive planning. =(

I am hoping my team will be amenable in moving forward and listen to side effects that I've had issue with prior... I need control of my brain back I'm so tired of not feeling in control of my own actions."

TW; Sexual assault, abuse

First time posting in this thread, but have been lurking for some time. I eventually want to post my story to combat some severe imposter syndrome but it is long and ridiculous and a LOT to read. 

That being said, I am a single parent to my amazing son who is also the son of one of my rapists and abusers. I'm not going to make any friends saying this, but it is difficult for me to tolerate the touch and needs of my son. (mind you I push past such) 

It has been extremely painful and dysphoric to have this cracked mirror double edged sword in having the love and fierce mama bear mentality juxtaposed by my child being a significant trigger for me. 

Six months ago I started some intense shadow work and tried to really tackle my sleep issues which ultimately resulted in recognizing significant memory loss around certain time periods of my life, obsessively picling at the borders of such and using associative memory recall to try and remember and procedded to retraumatize myself to self destruction and suddenly put me in a position of having all of these old symptoms (that I didnt acknowledge or recognize as I was self medicating with alcohol at the time). 

Anyway, since such it has been even harder to handle trigger responses with my son. 

But among many other achievements I am proud of myself for managing to put my sons needs first despite a significantly stressful and hard mental health day and allowing him to sleep in my bed with me because he needed some closeness with mom. I barely slept, BUT I effectively managed my panic and anxiety to be able to be by his side through the night and have him in a space that I already struggle to feel safe in. 

Long winded but regardless felt the need to share. ðŸ’œ"
ptsd,f80bpr1,t1_f7zuu6h,1574125169.0,I am dealing with this exact issue now as a cptsd vet from both perspectives given I've seen both horror and have experienced aggressive military sexual trauma coming from a place of poverty and having your shipmates turn on you. Recent triggers have me reliving nightmare after nightmare.
