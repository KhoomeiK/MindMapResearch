mpcproxies,foml9z4,t3_g8aqis,1587894297.0,"nice website! I would like to mention that I'm pretty sure my cards being off centre in MPC's online editor is just a bug in their preview system though

https://imgur.com/a/owRib9P

The first picture is how it looks in MPC's online editor after you upload the card image (off centre to the left), the second is how it looks on the finalise order page (centred), and the third is how it printed (very slightly miscut vertically because MPC isn't perfect, but centred horizontally)

In my opinion, sending them a centred base image is how you're most likely to get centred cards, and adjusting the positioning of card images to try to guess how they'll miscut your cards when it's just variance in their manufacturing process might interfere with that. These were from the same order, and the cards were aligned identically https://i.imgur.com/BSHRjF8.jpg https://i.imgur.com/B04LiY2.jpg"

MPC doesn’t have an API from what I can gather, but I’ve already automated the drag and drop interface - check out the video I linked :)"
mpcproxies,fmqdg80,t1_fmp2q8b,1586297539.0,"for multiple drives, it uses a simple priority system - cards in my drive are prioritised over Scryfall scans, for example, and in the web app the version with the highest priority is shown by default when you search for a card

Did a bit of research last night and it looks like it’s possible to distribute an executable for python so I’d be going down that road. Don’t undersell the convenience of being able to set up an order to fill out, then letting it do its thing though - imagine ordering a cube with a few double faced cards, I sure as hell don’t want to drag the card back onto every single other card’s back if I can avoid it"
mpcproxies,fmoyair,t1_fmoxpi8,1586270882.0,<3 for this I was thinking I’d look into ways I can distribute my code to be as painless to set up and use as possible - I realise my other tools can sometimes be inaccessible to people who aren’t inclined towards programming
mpcproxies,fmg2jjm,t3_fv1lac,1586039901.0,"1.	People typically use the *Custom Game Cards (63mm x 88mm)* option, and people tend to use either S30 (default) or S33 stock. MPC also prints in foil which you guys might find interesting 
2.	I’d guess that people would be keen to buy alt art & full art copies of popular commanders, but maybe a survey of the r/magictcg community could give you a more concrete idea of what’s in demand 
3.	I believe MPC can let you do this straight from their website actually! They have a marketplace where you can sell your designs, which I haven’t explored but it sounds like what you’re looking for. You’ll want to be very careful about what is and isn’t wotc’s IP though - it’s not just the card’s art (e.g. the mana symbols and the word Saproling are both owned by wizards of the coast)"

bootlegmtg,fk0cpsb,t1_fk03wrt,1583752391.0,"saying the site linked in the comments is “really
bad” is pretty insulting when a lot of effort went into generating the cards on that site - the print quality you get out of them is much better than you’ll ever achieve by printing Scryfall scans"
bootlegmtg,fk09mta,t3_ffqzcj,1583748564.0,"if you're looking into developing this further, getting an idea of the current state of the art could be helpful - proxycommander.com has a database of roughly 3k images and automatically downloads the images for a list of cards you input. It's not linked up to scryfall but it mostly uses my higher quality photoshop generated images (stored in my google drive in the pinned post on r/mpcproxies). With your python script, you have to make sure you remove the copyright line - my script (located at https://github.com/ndepaola/mpc-scryfall) handles this for M15 onward cards, and u/berndt_toast83 's modifications let this work on any card from any set. He has pretty much every full set rendered and stored on his google drive, also in the pinned post on r/mpcproxies. Charging money for this is probably not kosher - the most I do with regards to money is I have a tip jar on the github page for my photoshop tool, but in accordance with wotc's fan content policy, everything has to be free to access and paying is optional (I think, feel free to correct me if I'm misremembering). Rendering cards and not including the copyright line is already in a grey area and charging money for fake cards pushes it over the line in my book"
