I found a game where I'm not forced into combat against other players - instead that we play along team work against imense pve enjoyable content. For same amount of moneys spent as sub in BnS I have nice story, nice content and very good optimization, a very good atmosphere and a huge fan community, very helpful and old style. I can play with one character any class I want to, as well I can have with same character all crafting exists in game, without need to level up any other alts.
I enjoyed BnS, until some classes been buffed to sky and some others been getting irrelevant.
I sort of got draw off by the community managers and GM's leaving. Noticed from devs team a constant pull off and indifererency towards their subscribers. Couldn't raid anymore because constant lags. Pvp content became relevant just for whales.Crafting also became zero worth and mats were almost impossible to farm,pushing medium player into micro transactions step by step.
Seems situation haven't changed much. Good luck all, have fun on what's left of this game."

Kick your ego aside, otherwise it will ruin your life. Start praying. You are disconnecting yourself from your source of life. This is why people are disappointed, discouraged and then fall into themselves ego's. Because instead to give energy of love and care they tend to keep it only for themselves.

And game has a really good lore. Works very good and is optimized even in medium pc's. Why to pay sub on Bns that has nothing much left to offer? And devs and GM's not really listening us anymore? Think for yourself. Even their employees had to leave from NcSoft. Why spend more time and money on something that even them don't believe anymore?Game WAS fun. Awesome. But not anymore. Building up frustration on own players doesn't benefit no one. I'm sad to hear people struggling this way.. Just move on guys.
