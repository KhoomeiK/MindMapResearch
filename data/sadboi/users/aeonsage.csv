nutrition,fi46oig,t3_f5vh6h,1582135052.0,"Exact same dose for me. Recently found out I have vitamin D deficiency, been prescribed 50,000 IU weekly and have a level of 14. It's been 3 days but I haven't seen any improvement. I did have an upset stomach when I took it so that might have affected the absorption of it. 

My friend had a level of 12 and was on the same dose as me and said he felt improvements immediately. So I guess it varies from person to person. I hope that it starts helping with my depression and fatigue though."

GodofWar,f8n6g5s,t1_f8mhxwx,1574639659.0,It's actually part of the lore IIRC. Mjolnir was supposed to have a longer handle but it accidentally breaks during its creation. Thor just takes it as is.
