So you are good looking and charming enough to land tons of dates but nothing ever works? I am starting to think you have a problem that you don't realize yourself. I get 10 or something dates but 100s?
AskEurope,ff4rym1,t3_erkny7,1579571009.0,"Yes, and it is quite accepted. For the people against it; people adopting have to go through many many checks and fit a LOT of criteria to be allowed to adopt a child. And then for gay couples they can only adopt from the USA (often also only black children with handicaps) as other countries don't allow gay adoption and these are the least wanted. Compared to all the single mothers having 3 kids with 3 different black or arab men living on welfare gay couples often are way better parents."
