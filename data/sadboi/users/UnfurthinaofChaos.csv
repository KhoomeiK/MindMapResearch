Not only are YOU putting your son in a situation that is not healthy for him for your own convenience, you then proceeded to try to get a poor man fired when YOUR decision backfired. 

At no point did the bus driver do anything wrong other than supposedly give you a dirty look and YOU THEN TRIED TO GET HIM FIRED. Just wow."

Sounds like she‚Äôs going out of her way to make an effort to connect with him by learning his native language and he can‚Äôt be inconvenienced by an hour a week."

Alternately ‚Äúoh honey your looks will fade, but that personality is forever‚Äù

‚ÄúGood looks may run in your family, but obviously so does being a cunt.‚Äù

Instead of supporting you in an incredibly difficult time she‚Äôs being a horribly selfish person! If it were me, she‚Äôd have been gone after this stunt. If she can‚Äôt be supportive and sympathetic in a hard time, and what‚Äôs worse she turns it into something about herself, how could you spend the rest of your life with her?"
