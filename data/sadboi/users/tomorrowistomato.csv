AskWomen,fqotuf1,t3_gjlqos,1589524680.0,"I mean, being raised by a mom with extreme trauma and probably undiagnosed BPD was super fun. My whole childhood was watching my mom snap back and forth between loving me and despising me (as well as my older sister), so that was a bit confusing for my fragile developing psyche. 

I of course inherited my own share of mental health issues. I've been dealing with depression, anxiety, panic attacks, self-harm, eating/body image issues, and suicidal ideation since I was a teenager. After five years of individual therapy and about a year and a half of dialectical behavioral therapy, though, I am doing a lot better. I'm not *better* better, but things are okay and I usually don't want to kill myself, so I consider that a success. 

As for my mom, our relationship is healthier than it's ever been. We've both done a lot of work and learned how to communicate and trust each other. She isn't perfect by any means, but she's made a genuine effort to change her behavior, and that's what's important to me."

WomensHealth,fqnh20j,t3_ghzoml,1589494714.0,"There's nothing to be ashamed of! UTIs are *super* common for women. Like, most women will experience at least one UTI in their lives. Some of us are lucky enough to get lots of them. 

It doesn't mean that you're unclean or doing anything wrong. Sometimes they just happen. Bacteria naturally migrate and sometimes they end up in your urethra. Just make sure that you're wiping front to back, washing with a gentle soap, and that you pee immediately after sex. That's all you can really do. It's also very important that you don't delay treatment when you have UTI symptoms or you could end up with a kidney infection which is dangerous and quite painful. 

Hope you start feeling better soon. Make sure you finish all of your antibiotics, drink lots of water, and rest. Also, the over-the-counter medication Azo Urinary Pain Relief can alleviate a lot of your symptoms so I highly recommend it, just know that it might turn your pee orange/red."

AskWomen,fotanua,t3_g98xbj,1588048660.0,"All my bad study habits caught up with me when I got to college. In high school, I could get away with procrastinating to the very last minute. I could get away with skimming text to grab the important, relevant details without really *reading* things. I could quickly memorize notes before a test without really studying. I didn't need to be able to focus in a classroom for more than 45 minutes at a time (and even that was really hard). Larger projects were broken up into small, digestible assignments. Notes were basically handed to us and I didn't have to think too much about what to write down. 

All of that changed when I went to college. All-nighters became a regular occurrence because of my procrastination. I struggled to read dense, more complex writing. Long lectures were torture. Miraculously my grades stayed up, but I was hanging by a thread and grinding myself into the dirt.

Eventually it started to click for me, though. I started thinking about all of the signs that were there since my childhood, but were overlooked because I was intelligent and creative and ambitious. My behavioral problems as a kid were brushed off because they were only really present at home. My sensory issues were chalked up to me just being a quirky kid. 

After doing some research I realized everything I was going through was very consistent with ADHD. I found online communities and realized there were other people experiencing the exact same things that I did. It was such a relief to have that validation, to know that I wasn't stupid or lazy or undisciplined. It wasn't my fault. After going through an evaluation with a campus psychologist I was officially diagnosed, put on meds, and offered accommodations."

Try to maintain a healthy weight. And if you plan to lose weight at any point, take it slow, because rapid weight loss greatly increases your risk. There's some evidence that fish oil and olive oil can help prevent gallstones, but you really don't need to worry about that if you're not already at an increased risk."
