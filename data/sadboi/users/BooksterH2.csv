Isn't it more likely that the game's poor sales figures resulted in it losing support? If I were to offer my own conjecture, I'd say the horrible, confusing marketing throughout Q4 2018 and especially Q1 2019 and the incomplete, broken state of the game at launch were more responsible for poor sales than the Core Values incident and the game's resulting exclusion from Evo. 

On the marketing point, I'll say this... I had very little idea as to what TN was trying to sell me until I finally played the demo 2 weeks prior to release, and I had been following the news on DOA6 since December 2018.

This game unfortunately doesn't appeal to the majority of any one group. 

1. Most competitive DOA players reject the game because it was made too casual, some of them reject it for this combined with the point below.

2. Most competitive FGC players won't move to DOA6 because the hold and break hold system makes benefiting from winning neutral with most characters heavily read-based, and therefore ostensibly random. Because there's little execution involved in either throw punishing a hold as an attacker who won neutral and has the opponent in a stun or holding/break holding as a defender who's stunned after losing neutral, much of the damage feels read-based. 

3. Most casual players don't buy or stay with the game because they fall into one or both of the following groups: 
  
(a. The group that would buy the game for single-player content, local vs matches and maybe some sprinkling of online matches. They're not interested in sweaty matches online or playing at a high level. They're just here to relax and have fun. This game has less single player content than its predecessors, less costumes to unlock, less new stages, less base characters, etc. Why would they play a game with so little content to keep them interested?

(b. The fanservice crowd. You know why they play this series, and you know this game was marketed initially to essentially shed this group of fans. This group is disgruntled because they feel TN is trying to claim a moral high road and slapped them in the face after making money selling enormous amounts of DLC to them and everyone else in the last game. Their contention is that TN and KT decided to gamble and abandon an audience they knew would buy content for a phantom audience. 

DOA6 isn't a bad game. In fact, I love this game. However, this is a sanitized, stripped-down version of what could have been a great game. I think it was released way too early, and was marketed and set up for failure right out of the gate. 

But hey, those are just my opinions."
DeadOrAlive,fp7mwfz,t3_gbrjap,1588373661.0,"You aren't wrong. DOA6 doesn't compare to SC6 in terms of overall content, and much of the cosmetic content is locked behind a paywall. DOA5LR has the same concept as far as microtransactions are concerned, but the base game has more characters, stages, modes, costumes etc than DOA6 does. 

If you're looking for a waifu fighter to just play casually and for fun, DOA5LR is probably the game to get. You have lots of content, and a much wider variety of costumes to buy if you want to pick up a few. 

DOA6 simply doesn't qualify as a complete game in 2020. I personally love the gameplay and training/lab features more than what SC6 offers, so for me DOA6 has more staying power. I play more competitively so the gameplay itself is enough of a draw for my preference. For the average player who's interested in a fun casual game to get into, SC6 or DOA5LR are probably the ways to go."

As a community, we need to convey that these business practices are unacceptable and that the cost to their reputation (what's left of it) and potential profitability long-term will outweigh the short-term revenue they'll see as a result of employing such an obviously predatory monetization scheme. 

The season passes were on one level, but this pushes the boundaries of MTX monetization in a way that they've never done in the fighting game franchise, and sets a bad precedent.

Unlocking costumes is super fast now.  I genuinely don't see how you can view this as tedious after that patch. I would actually argue that there should have been more costumes at launch in the base game to unlock, not that they're too tedious to unlock. There's literally no criteria outside of playing your character in Arcade or ranked mode to unlock costumes. The ""parts"" aspect is completely superfluous and frankly stupid, but post-patch it all piles up ridiculously fast so it doesn't even matter. 

Agreed on the DLC. So much of it now is just repackaged from the last game, sold at the same price, and not even included in the absurdly priced season passes. Even the characters released in this game (aside from Kula) were already in the last game. Other fighting games re-release charactersl through DLC, though."
DeadOrAlive,fhxps0a,t1_fhxfe3k,1581959691.0,"I don't disagree. The new mechanics make the game easier to approach and simplify the game to a degree, but they did change the game in a way that can be offputting to legacy players. 

I personally don't have any real issue with the meter system outside of sidesteps requiring meter. The break holds make sense as a counter-balance to the fact that fatal stuns now require a fatal rush, break blow cancel, character specific inputs (Hitomi's 8H+K, for example), or particular move/stance interactions like Bayman's P+K against a low-holding opponent. In DoA5LR fatal stuns were primarily predicated on meeting a stun threshold that you'd have to progress toward."
DeadOrAlive,fhxfe3k,t3_f5894a,1581953088.0,"I would definitely recommend downloading the F2P version to see if it's your cup of tea before spending the money on the full version. 

If you're getting it on PS4, you won't have any issues finding matches generally. The game overall performs adequately, but there are noticable frame drops on occasion when lighting and particle effects are triggered on certain stages, at least on the base PS4 model. There are also 8 frames of input delay on PS4, which to the average player will be virtually imperceptible, but when competitively it does become an annoyance when trying to punish unsafe moves or generally react within short windows of opportunity. It wasn't a deal-breaker for me, as I've been playing since launch on this console, but it's something to take into account. The highest resolution you'll get on PS4 or PS4 Pro is 1080p, but it looks great.

There are several reasons I think the game stands out positively and make it worth playing. 

Firstly, it has the best training features of any fighting game aside from maybe UNIST that I've played, with MK11 coming close. Frame data, command training, combo training, computer recording, an extremely detailed and comprehensive tutorial... it's all there. The importance of QoL features like this can't be overstated, and it's something I didn't fully appreciate before branching out to games like Tekken and Soul Calibur. The one area where the tutorial suffers is in it's lack of brevity for certain sections. Whereas MK11 is very punctual and succinct with its tutorial lessons, DOA can sometimes inundate newer players with information and terminology. If you have experience with fighting games it shouldn't be an issue, but if you're new to the genre it has the potential to be overwhelming. 

Japanese fighting games aren't known for having good netcode, and DOA6 is no exception. If you have an ethernet cable and a fast internet connection you shouldn't have many issues if you're searching for matches in your own region. WiFi, as with most fighting games outside of maybe Killer Instinct, is almost always unstable and will yield mixed results. DOA6, however, gives you the option to see other players' connection speeds and whether they're on WiFi or wired before you accept a ranked match with them. You can also rematch to a best 2 out of 3.

The lobby system is excellent and other developers need to do what Team Ninja did with this game (besides not releasing them at launch). Instant, infinite and immediate rematches in the form of Versus lobbies are an option if you want to do a 1v1 session with a friend and want to skip the loading and character select screens between matches, and multiple match slots exist for lobbies with 4 or more people, so multiple people can playing their own matches separately in the same lobby. Again, this is awesome and I wish more fighting games had this. 

The game is, for better or worse, more accessible for casual players than previous iterations. The addition of the meter and Break Hold/Break Blow/Fatal Rush options are still controversial because they effectively lower the skill floor and barrier to entry at low levels. Doing a sidestep attack costs 25% of your meter, which is bizarre in a 3D fighter. Options for attacking and forcing up grounded opponents have significantly changed since the last game, and characters who could previously keep momentum after winning the neutral game against you can't force you back into a mixup like they could before. Again, this is fine for newer players but makes the game less appealing to many competitive players because it effectively resets the match back to neutral in most cases rather than allowing the player who won the neutral in the first place to maintain pressure while the opponent is on the ground. 

Team Ninja updates the game very regularly with balance patches (some of which are significant while others leave my head), and costume DLC is released with every one.

The DLC practices in the game are well-known and are a source of ire for a lot of people. The prices for season passes are exorbitantly high, so unless you like burning money, just buy an outfit for a specific character you like for $2.00 or $3.00 and call it a day. The season passes don't even cover the outfits that are being re-released from the last game. 

Some people dislike the game frankly because it doesn't cater to their specific wants, and rather than moving on to something more in line with what they like, they spend time and energy trying to make sure other people don't like it either. Strange, but to each their own. 

Overall, it's worth trying at least. While I recognize the flaws, I personally love the game. There's a great pocket of the community that's always willing to help and answer questions as well.

That said, I agree to a large extent that the fanservicey stuff being as prevalent and up-front in its presentation gatekeeps people who would otherwise try the game, but the series wasn't going to attract more people by ditching it. Sure, the hypothetical onlookers you mention might laugh, but without the fanservice I don't think we'd have anything there to mock. 

While I and others who play the game like the game and its mechanics for the most part, the developers haven't done a particularly good job of marketing that draw to potential newcomers. Without a solid audience cultivated to play the game on a competitive level and market it competitively, the fanservice is a large part of what keeps this series alive."

DeadOrAlive,ff5d42f,t1_ff5cfzm,1579587915.0,"You're happy that it's a lazy recolor because of that? Okay, fair enough. I would actually frame it as insulting that the developers think this is anything close to an additional incentive to pay for the season pass."
DeadOrAlive,ff4yfus,t1_ff4x4nm,1579575465.0,"Yes, it's been a regular thing since release. I suppose the point I'm trying to make is that the practice of simply recoloring a previously existing cosmetic and then repackaging it as exclusive and ostensibly new content is a tad lackluster."
DeadOrAlive,ff4sut8,t1_ff4spz1,1579571629.0,"No, I mean these are literally recolors of a previously released pack. These are the wedding outfits from last March. I'm not talking about recolors within the same costume set."
DeadOrAlive,ff4r4md,t1_ff4o6kv,1579570437.0,That's a recolor of outfits they released almost a year ago.
alcoholism,few6ztn,t3_eqr31e,1579406207.0,"Don't. No one has ever NOT gotten drunk and regretted it. You'll wake up tomorrow well-rested and not-hungover and that's another day you can be fully present and human. 

Just cash in early tonight, man. 

Tomorrow is a totally new day. You can do this."
DeadOrAlive,few5c4c,t3_eqqo6y,1579405631.0,These actually look really good. Much better than anything offered last year.
depression,fevif5s,t3_eqorse,1579397761.0,"All things considered, this is actually a very nice, well-intentioned post. I think most people here would say they wish the best for you as well.

I'm doing the same thing, but without the SO. 

I hope things look up for you soon."
DeadOrAlive,fdzoa9k,t3_en8b4j,1578792399.0,I just want my dude Leon to come back.
DeadOrAlive,fdql28t,t3_emr7ep,1578669240.0,No.
DeadOrAlive,fcp6odz,t3_ei8jvh,1577852250.0,"I'm surprised to see you're running into smurf accounts to the extent that you've got different players at F rank who are regularly doing 80 percent combos on you.

I'm almost about to start my own account just to see. 

There is one Eliot player who smurfs semi-regularly. I personally just beat him and end his 25+ win streak and move on. Beyond that, I haven't seen any smurfs."
DeadOrAlive,fclzvur,t3_ehvc4f,1577760595.0,"Lawl.

Sick bait! Got em!"
DeadOrAlive,fcdhjhf,t1_fcdghgz,1577610079.0,"I am. You're welcome to add me at any time. 

My PSN is BooksterH4."
DeadOrAlive,fcdamtl,t1_fcd86bj,1577608291.0,"That's something we all go through. You're not alone. 

Just try to play and watch your replays to figure out what blew you up. If possible, find someone who's roughly around your skill level if not a little better and play them as much as possible. If you come across someone in ranked who fits the bill, ask them for some private matches and add them. You need an opportunity to test the waters and see what does and doesn't work against someone of a similar level of experience."
DeadOrAlive,fcd5r0c,t3_egytno,1577606696.0,"Stick to small, incremental goals. Don't count ""wins"" as victories. 

Did you go into a match planning to finally block that low kick on the Hitomi string that keeps counter-hitting you?  Did you block it? Sick! Now you know what to look for next time, and because you reacted to/read it once, you know you can do it again. 

Did you wake up after a knock down and crouch immediately because you knew that punk-ass Bayman was gonna try his 19 to 23 frame offensive hold throw against you? If you did, hell yeah. You now know how to deal with that specific situation and can instill fear in their hearts. 

Block and then crouch Nyotengu's neutral kick KK string after the 1st kick guard breaks on your block? Damn, bro. You're already doing something almost no one is thinking to do in a match. 

As with anything, stick to small goals. You're not going to jump in and start whooping people."
DeadOrAlive,fc7j08o,t3_egl5qj,1577508940.0,"Get Core Fighters first and see if you like the mechanics before you spend any money. That will answer your question.

You can't go wrong with MK11 or T7, though."
DeadOrAlive,fc2r8sj,t1_fc2qarv,1577371679.0,"There's some serious BS going on here. After a 30+ win streak, chances are you're doing something sketchy. At 285 wins, you're definitely doing something. Especially playing like this guy. He's not terrible but he's not very good either. 

What U rank player actually mashes H+K and PPPPPP over and over like that? His YouTube channel has videos where the othet player is literally walking up and doing nothing."
DeadOrAlive,fc2qq16,t3_efrugp,1577371221.0,"So glad you're enjoying the game! Welcome. 

As someone else said here, the recovery frames are shown as the last number, to the right of the active frames which are shown in parentheses.

If you ever have questions feel free to ask."
