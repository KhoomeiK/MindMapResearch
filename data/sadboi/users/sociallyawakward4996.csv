photography,fqzxkk5,t3_gk72wh,1589777942.0,"Hi I just wanted some advice. I'm a beginner photographer, I just bought my first  camera a Canon EOS Rebel T7 , but now that I'm reading more and more reviews I was thinking of getting a Canon 60d  body with a 50mm lens since I'm planning on doing fashion photography. But will the T7 be good for portraits or should I return my camera once it comes in and get something else? My budget I'm willing to spend is ($400)."

jobs,fni1fd9,t1_fni01y4,1586972355.0,Lol what jobs don't require a portfolio. I hope I don't sound rude but I haven't found a single one yet at least for photography.
jobs,fnhuuhh,t1_fnhipsj,1586969230.0,A media degree means nothing if you don't have a stunning portfolio. Most places in the arts don't care about a degree just your portfolio and even then it's hard to get into the industry. Nowadays if you want to be an artist it's best to start your own business and even then it's rough getting started. I know I'm only 21 but it will probably take at most 7 years before I get into the industry as a business own of my own brand. In the arts you have to push yourself and literally be crazy about it because getting a degree really won't get you anywhere if you don't have the talent or the passion.

No one can get along there's always will be a divide whether it's political or medical or anything. Humans can't really get along, since people always will have a different opinion and think there opinion is correct while the other persons opinion is wrong. It's pretty much the Dunning kruger effect. Everyone thinks they know more then the other person no one wants to admit they are wrong. So for me I've given up with people at this point.

raisedbynarcissists,flqttyq,t3_fqgjj3,1585406038.0,Try and keep your cool and get back on your meds if you can. My mom has never hit me or pulled my hair so I can't imagine how that would be. But I have had meltdowns when I was off my medication and attacked her due to not being able to handle the constant nagging and criticism . And even now a year later when I'm back on my medicine and doing fine. My mom still uses those things as leverage to kick me out.

And has a lot of trauma and anger and has been taking it out on me . Especially now since her boyfriend left her because she was being too controlling.  And now she is very clingy towards me and upset when I can't or don't give her affection but am around my partner . So she has been turning my boyfriend against me by saying that he doesn't love me and will leave me and that only she will love me . And how much she needs me in her life and can't live without me. She apologized today for lashing out at me for a couple of weeks and hugged me and said she loves me. But I know it will happen again since subconsciously she isn't dealing with her issues and just using my affection as a way to fix them. But I'm tired and I've just learned to play her game and give her the affection she needs and just not be myself or say what's really going on in my head. It sucks but at least I have some supportive friends ."

raisedbynarcissists,flif09q,t3_fp174c,1585181126.0,We fought when my mom and I talked about the virus and she was saying I was putting her in harm's way ( this was before she didn't allow me to leave the house our state only has a curfew) then the fight escalated after I giggle when she misspelled a word then she got upset and threw a tantrum and made fun of my cutting scars and called me demonic . I hate that I can't remember everything . Then recently like yesterday I went to go and see my boyfriend and she threatened to make me not see him and my friends at all so I'm on personal lockdown.

raisedbynarcissists,fk7weqs,t1_fk6df0o,1583944875.0,I know my mom has trauma she told me about it growing up. It's just hard for me to know when she guilt tripping me . Like I can't see my sickly grandpa because of work and I know he will die soon and I am prepared but my mom is making me feel bad for not going but saying it's my choice. Just things like that I don't understand. Like what's the plan in saying she's upset but saying it's ok if I do something. I'm very new to even thinking she's a covert narc. So I'm just unsure how to feel or even how to talk to her without getting emotional.

TrueAskReddit,fh2lrud,t1_fh1qg1m,1581257252.0,That is true. I'm a atheist but I understand . I mean I'm over it now and I don't love them any less but the topic of cyber bullying or telling someone they should commit suicide and not face any sort of punishment rubbed me the wrong way. After talking to my boyfriend he is explained it more clearly and I agree. I feel like the government shouldn't be involved in personal matter like if someone tells someone they should kill themselves but I feel like there should be some sort of punishment but not attempting manslaughter and years and years for prison. But maybe having a ban of some sort. But people will always say shitty things and be shitty and everyone will at some point say something that is upsetting to me but I have to get over it.
TrueAskReddit,fh2lfw8,t1_fh1uvpq,1581256982.0,Well yeah they are nice or good people but I don't think anyone is tbh . I mean I'm over what they said now and I talked to my boyfriend on how it made me a bit upset . He just feels like it shouldn't be the government's responsibility for issues like someone telling someone to kill themselves or someone killing themselves which I agree people should be able to say or do whatever they want without government involvement . But I feel like there is crossing a line at some point .
TrueAskReddit,fh2l732,t1_fh2hnv0,1581256750.0,No lol I wouldn't leave them over that it just rubbed me the wrong way but I'm over it now .
TrueAskReddit,fh2l5df,t1_fh2im6l,1581256702.0,Yeah. I mean I talked to my boyfriend about it yesterday he said he didn't mean to say it in a malicious manner just he feels it shouldn't be the government's responsibility to be in other people's lives like that . I said I understand but just I feel like saying someone should kill themselves for any reason is a rude thing to say.

I shouldn't  and I'm over it now  but things like that just bothers me .
TrueAskReddit,fh1ohds,t1_fh1mlq9,1581219664.0,No I feel like I was just overreacting to the situation at hand. But I tend to feel a lot of emotion towards how something may affect someone else. Since I think a lot of others feelings and almost emulate there emotions into my own life. So it bothered me when they said that. But now thinking it over I understand that they didn't mean any harm .
TrueAskReddit,fh1i6m6,t1_fh1fpkw,1581215825.0,But how do I help the fact that I feel bitter and anger towards them . I know that only comes with time . But it's hard for me as a hypempathic person to understand there feelings.

My mom does support me with things I like as long as it fits with her traditions . Like she supports me with my photography career but she doesn't support the fact I'm transgender she constantly misgenders and misnames me unless we are in public because it's a inconvenience to her since I have been on horomones for 10 months and pass as male in public also it's been about 6 years since I came out but everytime I would bring it up to her she would respond that it's hard for her because I'm her only kid or use an excuse of her being a single mother. Using that excuse is her favorite one . Like we might argue and afterwards she would have me sit down while she goes on a lecture about the argument . And uses the fact that she's a single mom to explain why she might act a certain way towards me. And I get being a single mom is hard but you can only use something so much . With the boyfriend thing as well. My mom hates how much I'm around my boyfriend. She constantly accuses me of loving him over her because how much I'm over there and not with her . The reason I'm over there so often is because my boyfriend's family is somewhere that feels like home . My boyfriend family is very non traditional compare to my mom like they are heavy religious but unlike with my mom I can say whatever is on my mind . While with my mom I can't say what's on in my mind without her going on a lecture trying to relate her life to mind and always talking over me in a conversation . At my boyfriend's house everyone listens , no one talks over each other , and you can disagree as long as you have a way to back it up with some sort of facts not just yelling about how you are being disrespectful to the family or bratty. Maybe I'm being "" bratty"" or "" disrespectful"" but I'm me I'm not trying to be fake. So maybe you are being a brat or mean but you shouldn't change yourself to make others around you happy . Your mom should be there for you even if you are nothing alike . I'm sorry . My mom isn't as bad as others but it's just her mental health and age and background. For the longest I would hate her for being that way but now I know she won't change. And that's ok also you don't have to love your parents or like everything they do it doesn't make you bad ."

I'll try again and see if it improves anything. Thanks for the comment . Some weird part of me wants to stop my trich but my mom has always made me feel ashamed about pulling and shaving my head in the past ( now she doesn't care anymore and thinks I'll do this for life) But it was a way of coping with that by pulling.

findapath,ff30cmb,t1_ff1vedz,1579530254.0,"Capitalism actually helps creativity. The definition of Capitalism is -an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state. Capitalism helps boost businesses which means anyone can start a business art, music, theater, and film . Anyone is free to start a business without government control . Without Capitalism your society will fail. The government doesn't have enough money to care for everything and everyone. But people just tend to blame big business but fail to realize that the government controls business not the opposite way around. So if you want to blame anyone for your issues blame the government not businesses. Everything is started with business.

raisedbynarcissists,fez21ga,t3_eqs4ti,1579453125.0,My question is my mom was acting really apologetic and said she is sorry for the wrong things she has done in the past and is constantly working towards bettering herself. So I can tell if she actually is going to change her behavior or not I guess apologizing is a start. I know I need to be more open up with her. But in the past I was open and was just hurt by how she would react or she will go on rants about when I was a kid or just bringing up unrelated conversations about her life to try to relate.

But I was on T for little over a year and my mom stopped paying for my horomones because she believed it wasn't an important issue . So I ended up stopping them abruptly and I experienced a lot of mood swings and problems with controlling my emotions I already suffer from other mental health issues. So going off it for a year and stopping that abruptly did mess me up on the emotional side. Also it just took a physical toll on me I gained a bunch of weight on T just to lose it. I mean if you start on a low dose and slowly ease off of it I guess that's fine. But even so you can be on a low dose and still get unwanted changes. But for me after that year I sort of shoved my dysphoria under a rug and it just started building and buliding until I had a breakdown and decided it was best to go back on it and get back into therapy . And I'm a lot happier now .
truscum,feie0xv,t3_ep8jck,1579136319.0,I wish people would understand going on horomones for a short period of time to get masculine quality and going off then on is really really bad for your health. Also you cant pick and choose what you get on T so I hope these lesbians don't mind having a mustache and being sweaty all the time and being covered in acne ðŸ˜˜

BPD,fdtbtvg,t3_eer7az,1578714543.0,My friend joked around about my aniexty when I get stoned I know she was joking but I got so pissed but didn't say anything and just lied about having to leave and left my FP with them since they are his friends as well. I really want to spam my FP but I'm trying not to .
