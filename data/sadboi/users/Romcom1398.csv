AskReddit,fprgsop,t3_gexhgi,1588853740.0,"In the park near our house, there is this one bench pretty much known as a hanging place for the older people. Around 6/7 pm you'll see about five older people sitting there, talking, often joined by other people who come and go, younger people, kids, older people, you name it.

I get along really well with this one man. He is incredibly nice and sweet and I really like talking to him. He has a grandpa vibe. I often try to avoid walking towards that bench because the group is usually about 5+ people and I have major social anxiety. But when I catch that man alone or with one other person I for sure will walk up to them to chat.

Anyway.
About maybe 4 years ago, I was standing there. The group was pretty big but I forgot to wall the other way so once I was headed in their direction I couldn't simply walk off, and the man called me over and we had a nice chat and I was all smiley. 

Then this other guy, a Moroccan man with a heavy accent, started talking to me.
""Did you know that in my homecountry you would probably be married by now? It isn't strange at all for a 15 year old to be married to an older man like me.""
I found it to be a little odd, but me, being naive and thinking the best of most people, figured he was just trying to make some small talk, so I laughed and acted surprised and like I wanted to know more about it, thinking he would start talking more about his home country. I wouldn't have minded that. I like learning about other cultures and other people. But he kept going back to the 'marrying young' topic. 

He started asking if we could be friends. If I could give him my number, so we could be friends. It wouldn't be more than that, just friends. He said this other woman also gave him her number and they were great friends, it wouldn't be more than that.
I said no thanks, that I thought it was sweet but no thanks, I don't think that is smart. And he kept pressuring me.

Now, remember the grandpa man? He was behind the guy, making a weird face and trying to tell me to cut it off. I thought je was joking. He and this weird man were sitting together, obviously they got along, so he must be joking right? If they get along, this weird man can't be that bad. So I started laughing because I didn't know what else to do. And he kept talking about my number or maybe he could give me his number. And me, being polite, wanted to try to stop the conversation but he kept talking so I couldn't just walk off like that,  that would be rude, and what if he really just wanted to be friends?

But eventually the older man interrupted him and told him he should stop and then I smiled and jokingly said 'OKAY BYE I HAVE TO GO NOW' and basically ran off 

Then the grandpa man followed me and tried to make sure I was okay. I was on the verge of crying but I laughed it off, and I thanked him (at least I hope I did. I was very stressed. But I think I did). He said thay I should have walked off immidiately, and that he thought the guy was really weird and stuff. And then we split ways, I walked home, I burst out crying and then my dad rushed out to the hanging place, the old man pointed him in the direction of where the guy went, and my dad pulled him off his bike to the ground. 

A few weeks later I walked into the weird guy, and he said he was a boxer and if he saw my dad he would really mess him up and he could sue my dad for attacking him. I'm still scared I'll walk into him, and whenever I see a guy of around his age, brown skin, and his kind of posture, I just walk all the way around to make sure he won't be able to follow me home.

But yeah. Basically the nice thing is that the older man helped me and made sure I was ok. I wish he was sitting alone more often. I can't walk up to a group of people, so I avoid them and so it looks like I avoid HIM, which I am not, I just- AJSBDJDB.
So yes, good guy. He deserves the absolute best.

He also made sure I was okay when an out of control grabbed a sick bird on the ground and swung it all around. We were looking at the little bird and like 'what should we do?' and then this big dog who's owner can't control him ran up to the bird and grabbed it like a squichy toy. I tried to stop the dog but the guy told me not to because the dog could easily attack me, and then afterward he made sure I was okay. He just is such a nice and good man."

The steps you gave sound incredibly helpful, but right now I'm going to sleep since it's 10.30 pm over here. I'll continue working on it tomorrow though:) 

Also, I started looking on Google a bit and I a post where someone said 'CBT changes the thoughts, mindfulness makes you aware of the thoughts. If you're not aware of them, you can't change them, so if you only use CBT and you feel bad because of negative thoughts you're not aware of, you might only become more stressed because you feel like you're not changing your thoughts the right way'. 
And that, I think, relates to what you mentioned about both treatments working on different parts and both doing great things. So maybe I can find an article on that.


One question though, if you don't mind. But you don't have to answer it if you don't want to, because it's kind of a 'what if, then what?' question. 

What would you do when you have two statements, both with a credible source, but there are no studies on the link between the two statements you want to make, because it just needs logical thinking to put them together. Would you still need a source for that? 

In my case that could be 'people with social anxiety tend to fear social situations (that would need a source), CBT often includes exposure therapy, which is a social situation (that would need a source too) whereas mindfulness doesn't (that would also need a source, but now I'm wondering how you could get a source for a statement that is negative like that), and so you might assume that some people with social anxiety might prefer mindfulness. Would it be ok to assume that, without citing a paper explicitly talking about that link?

(I wrote this after I found the post about how you need both for it to be really effective, so I might not even land in this situation, but I'm still curious if it would be ok to do)."
college,fp360pv,t1_fp30utm,1588273697.0,"Okay, thanks, I hope this is a little bit better:  
From what I understand and already know, mindfulness has the following benefits:

1. It reduces anxiety 
2. It reduces depression
3. It improves sleep
4. It increases self esteem and self acceptance
5. It improves focus
6. It reduces stress
7. It reduces chronic pain
8. It lowers blood pressure 
9. Improvements in learning and memory
10. It can improve the immune system
11. It can make you think more clearly

And from the articles I used for the actual research:

1. It improves the ability to switch thoughts
2. This can be very useful for people with social anxiety because it can improve exposure therapy results
3. Also (but this isn't from the studies), since people with social anxiety tend to ruminate a lot, being able to easily switch thoughts instead of being stuck on one negative thought sounds very useful, from my point of view.
4. It can reduce avoidance behavior
5. It changes reactivity with negative selfbeliefs (from what I understand,  after a bad thought, the amygdala was equally active before and after a breathing excercise. But after the mindfulness intervention, after a breathing excercise the amygdale reduced in activity. So to put it shortly, mindfulness makes it easier to calm down after a bad thought.

I think those were the most important parts"

college,fp2xgux,t1_fp2j5a3,1588269517.0,"Hi! Thank you so much for this!

Personally, I can think of the following reasons what the benefits of mindfulness might be (but maybe I have a distorted view on CBT, so sorry if I do)

* While both can be practised at home with books, I think (but I'd need to research that) there are **more apps for mindfulness than for CBT**. And I think it's much easier to use an app than to read a whole book. Oh, and for mindfulness there are also a lot of guided meditations inside apps, but I don't know if there is something similar for CBT.
* **Maybe mindfulness is easier to practise?**   
In therapy I had a hard time with CBT because I had to question everything I thought, and my therapist kept saying 'So what if they think you're weird? What happens then?' and it kind of kept going in circles because I knew nothing bad would happen, so it shouldn't bother me, but it did. I didn't feel like it was very helpful for me.  
With mindfulness, you don't have to try so hard to change your bad thoughts, you just have to accept them. There is no 'this thought is unhelpful so let's analyse it very carefully and end up with the conclusion that the chance that it is true is very small and that you won't die if it is true', just a 'yes, this thought is here, they float in and out like clouds so you can easily also let the thought go'. For CBT I'd need a piece of paper to write all things down and with mindfulness you don't need to focus on anything except for noticing the thoughts that appear.
* **Mindfulness doesn't include exposure therapy**, the very reason I quit CBT.
* Cognitive behavior therapy sessions usually take place outside of someone's home, and **maybe people with social anxiety find it hard to seek therapy because then they'd have to talk to new people**. And mindfulness has a lot of apps that don't involve strangers, but again, both treatments also have useful books that are both almost equally effective.
* **Cognitive behavioral therapy doesn't work for everyone?** But for that, I'd have to find a study on CBT and social anxiety, see the results where they conclude that it seems to work in a lot of cases, and then I 'd have to go 'But not in all cases!' which doesn't sound very good to me, since I don't think you can base anything on that. Maybe you can, but I don't really know a lot about research.

And that is about all I can think of. But I have no idea of any of these ideas sound useful. Maybe some CBT also doesn't include exposure therapy. Maybe CBT is also easily practicable but I just haven't found that yet. Maybe CBT is actually easier to practise and I just have a very distorted view on it.

&#x200B;

>From there, I've got some ideas about where you can go to develop your essay.

Also, I already summarised the three articles I'm using for the main part of the paper. They all pointed towards mindfulness having positive effects on social anxiety symptoms. So I already sort of developed the essay. Yet have to get feedback on that part from my instructor though. But right now all I need to focus on is bettering my introduction.  


Do you happen to have any tips, or ideas what sort of studies to look for?"
college,fp2smnb,t1_fp2j81f,1588267214.0,"It is intro yes, hahaha. It's a class for academic skills, and the end project is the review paper.   
Considering this is already kind of hard for me (I literally spent about ten hours just trying to find a few ok studies, a few weeks back), I am not looking forward to actually writing difficult papers hahaha. 

I did find a study comparing both treatments, and the conclusion was something along the lines of 'They both have about the same effect, but MBSR has slightly bigger effects on improving energy and reducing pain' but then I'd need to find another study about why it's especially for social anxiety useful to have bigger effects with those aspects. And then I'd have to cross studies and that's not ok.   


Also, thanks for the help!"
college,fp2rpip,t1_fp2mg5v,1588266776.0,"Yes, we use APA as well. I just find it very difficult to determine what exactly I should be looking for. In the few studies comparing CBT and mindfulness for (social) anxiety I have found so far, they don't really talk about why they are doing the research besides the fact that in the last couple of decades the popularity of mindfulness has really grown.   


My teacher doesn't want me to assert that mindfulness is better, though, maybe I should have used other words. We needed to write the introduction, and for that, we need to explain the important terms, why this research is important, and it all needs to be linked to our own research questions and the articles that we're comparing in the study. And I figured, since I'm going to compare mindfulness and it's effects on social anxiety, that it would be useful to talk about other often used treatments like CBT.

  
So I explained the basics of CBT in a few sentences, and then said 'and alternative is mindfulness' and went on to explain what that is. And the feedback was 'Explain the problem area some more, why is there need for an alternative?' 

  
The way I read that, is 'In what ways is mindfulness better than CBT, or why would people prefer to use mindfulness instead of CBT?'. In some articles I found, in the introduction they say that 'CBT has been proven effective, but not for everyone' and then they reference an article from before 2010, which we can't use.  What I am thinking, is that people might prefer mindfulness since it doesn't involve exposure therapy, which is the reason for my quitting with CBT (I didn't want to stand up randomly in class and do something stupid just to learn that, see, it doesn't have awful consequences after all! It's okay to make mistakes!). But I haven't been able to find any studies on 'people with social anxiety tend to stop with CBT because of exposure therapy'.

Thank you so much!"
college,fp2ij5j,t1_fp2gblr,1588262347.0,"I could do that yes, but in the introduction I also used another acticle to make a point, and then used my own words to form a bridge between that and my own paper. 

The paper said that with social anxiety there is an empathy imbalance and a disruption in a brainarea which disrupts cognitive processing during awkward moments and causes social anxiety. 

And then I said 'so it is useful to make sure the cognitive process isnt disrupted during awkward moment, for examply by making sure there is less focus on the awkward moment.'

But I needed sources for that as well (and yet have to find those). Now that I read it again, however, I feel like my whole reasoning doesn't make sense, I I might have to look at that again.

My point being, if I have a paper on social anxiety treatment and one on the criticism of cbt, I'd still have to link those together and need a paper to specifically tall about that link, stating 'social anxiety treatments use this, and cbt doesn't have that' because else I'd just be using my own reasoning. At least, I think so. I don't know. I'm new to all this.

college,fp2gpti,t1_fp2fnqf,1588261462.0,"That's what I was also thinking, but then I started searching and I found an article saying something along the lines of 'there are selfhelpbooks for MBSR and for CBT' and the study was about which was more effective (there wasn't much difference). And considering books are also fairly easily accesible, I figured that would make the argument invalid.

Also, the studies I compared in the middle part of the paper are all about mindfulness training where people have weekly groupsessions and get homework. And I guess the homeworkpart is easily accesible with apps, but the grouptraining part isn't.
And so I thought that if I used the argument that mbsr is easily accesible (for individuals, with apps and websites), and then started comparing studies about mindfulness where they used groupsessions as well, it wouldn't make sense.

But it might. Maybe I'm just thinking this over too much, I just don't want to do it all wrong hahaha"

I didn't like giving speeches when I grew older, but at first I liked it. I even came up with the idea of doing a play with my friends in front of all the parents (it totally failed, we didnt really... I dont think you could even call it a play, it was more improv-ish). I liked reading my stories that I wrote for the class, I joined in on the reading contest (which I lost, boohoo), I had a few friends... 
And it's not like the problem lies at home either.
My parents are amazing, full of love and always encouraging us and supporting us no matter the mistakes we make. 
The only thing I can think of is that my parents are huge introverts, we used to go to family gatherings SOMETIMES but my parents quickly grew bored of that, so we dont really have any extended family things anymore. So like, introvert, introvert, not really any other social contacts outside of school and our small family... Maybe that played a role. Idk this is me just rambling and putting of doing my schoolwork oop

I am very biased because I have social anxiety and ADD (and maybe depression?), and my friends are autistic.

But.  
It sounds a little bit like social anxiety? The part where you talk about being intimidated and then not knowing how to look.   
Then the not being able to focus part makes me think of ADD, but it could also be because of how much you focus on controlling your eyes that you're unable to focus on other things. But they also often go together, anxiety and adhd.   
And my friend and I talked about eye contact yesterday. She was recently diagnosed with autism and said she pays on awful amount of attention on making the right amount of eye contact when talking, and that that is something that is apperently common in people with autism.

Ok so, I had to order books for school and wanted to do that yesterday. But they're pricy, and I don't have any jobs right now since I'm a temporary in catering. I can afford them, but I don't have any more incoming money right now. And so, first I was like 'Ok gonna go try to see if there's any free stuff online, like, free books, pdf's, etc.' and that took me about three hours, just scrolling and scrolling and scrolling. Then I was like 'Ok maybe I should look at the other jobs my agency has aside from catering so I can make money' and so I went through emails to see what they said about the Corona virus, what that meant for me, what jobs I could do, I wrote a whole new curriculum vitae (dont know what it is in English and too lazy to look it up, is it CV?) sent out an application, and suddenly it was dinner time, we played a short family board game and meanwhile I was looking at other websites to order my books from in a cheaper way, maybe Amazon, since I had a gift card from there, but it was an American gift card and the book I needed was on the Dutch Amazon, and so I had to look up what the rules were there, about switching giftcards etc, which took me two hours, and around nine pm I decided to just order my books from the first site I had, the pricier one.

And that's what I spend my whole day on. Ordering. Two. Books. 

Don't know if it's kind of the same thing.
But I do know I can relate to the trouble with switching tasks. It's why I always leave my stuff downstairs. Like school stuff. Because if I clean it up, the flow will be broken and it will take a while for me to gather all my school stuff again and continue on what I was working on. And I need to have school tasks (or parts of them) finished before the end of the day. 
Which sucks because it's usually around 4 pm that I'm like 'Ok I really should do something' and then it's 10 pm, my mum is like 'Don't go too late to sleep again, all right?' and I'm like 'Yeah this will probably take ten more minutes' and then it turns out it takes more than that, but I am ALMOST done and I don't want to have to continue with that task tomorrow even though I have a lot of days left for the task, and then it's 12 and I'm finally done."

Hated it, because this one lady hated my guts because I did everything wrong (because they didn't really properly train me since there weren't enough people), and then when I slowly learned stuff she hated me because I'm a doormat (well she didn't say it, but basically she kept picking on me because she could). She's stand behind me lookingat how I'm putting stuff away and I'd freeze, thinking 'Here we go again, prepare for yelling' and then she'd be like ""KEEP WORKING, I'm just standing here!"". More people had trouble with her but since I didnt stand up to her she kept nitpicking me, and near the end of my time there, like a year or so, she was transfered to anothee location. I even cried two times because of her. Once because I did something wrong, she yelled, I felt stupid and during the break I apologized to her for not doing things the right way, and then she was like ""You've been working here a month now, you're supposed to know these things by now, even ... knows it already"". I think it was about where everything in the back was, like kitchen stuff is in that corner, living stuff there. She explained it once and the just trusted for me to remember it just like that, andwhen Id ask where something was maybe a week later, shed yell at me. 
So that wasn't fun.

But then I kind of got the hang of it, and I started looking for a new job and by doing so I cared less about being perfect at work so it was much easier. And all my other coworkers were amazing. I met my best friend there, and with her, another friend and another girl (all from work) we aent to Disney within maybe two months of meeting eachother. And the this other girl was gay, like me, but very talkative and strong and like, not caring about what anyone says. She basically pulled me out of the closet 'Hey do you mind if I tell her?' '... Tell me what?' and yeah I didnt really have a choice. Normally Id not be ok with that, like, outing is not cool, but I'm glad she did it. Everone eventually knew I was gay, they liked me (at least I think so) because I was sweet, this one coworker, a guy, even told me once that for some reason whenever I was in the room he jist became a lot more happy. In a non flirty way. And became a lot more comfortable talking to everyone, and near the end Id feel comfortable enough with them to joke around, the funny dances, high fives, sing around a bit (they did too), play games, just... yeah.

I grew a lot there. And even though it started out awful and the job itself was awfully boring (waitinf for customers to show up), it was by far my favorite job because of the jokes, banter, groaning together when the last customer wouldnt effing leave, being like 'AAH FIVE MORE MINUTES' or 'Ok your turn to talk into the microphone and tell everyone to leave'. I actually was so anxious to use the microphone the first time. Near the end, two of my coworker (and friends, we grew apart though) always asked me to do it because they were nervous, and by then it was just second nature to me basically."

Oh, AND: ok so we have to write a review paper for school (psychology) and I'm doing it about mindfulness and (social) anxiety.
Turns out in many cases mindfulness has positive effects on your selfesteem, makes the bad thought be less frequent, and overal social anxiety symptoms just tend to lessen.
There was this one study (I lost it because it wasn't fit for my assignment but I'll try to find it back) where these people had to do a presentation, and afterwards one group had a mindfulness session and one didnt. Then the mindfulness group ended up having less bad thoughts and/or (not sure) ruminated less about how they did than the other group. And that's just with a short session, while usually mindfulness based stress reduction or mindfulness based cognitive therapy is a course of 8 weeks.

So idk, maybe try mindfulness? It's really easy to do and even with just fifteen minutes a day or sonthere could be positive effects. I put it off for years because it sounded so vague, so I don't have any experience of whether it works or not, but I'm planning on trying it out. Thought I'd mention it in case it might help you."
mentalhealth,flwzno8,t3_frocnt,1585570982.0,"In my opinion, a bad person is someone who does bad things that hurt others, intentionally. I think as long as you try to be nice and treat others with respect and dignity, you're not a bad person.

Concerning the other things, I feel eerily similar.

I don't talk about myself too often because I don't want to be seen as a narcisist, so I let my friends bring up subjects they want to talk about and the go with that.
I'm far from an expert, still have lots of trouble with conversations unlessit's with my close family or two best (and only) friends. But what I have found through work, is that it helps to ask questions about whether someone is talking about, and talk a bit about your experience and view. It's definitely not easy but practise really does make perfect (or well, better. I still suck at social skills).
And my doctor person who I talk to always says 'you're allowed to be here, to take up space, just like everyone else. You're allowed to talk and think things and express yourself.'

I don't know what your art looks like or means, but I can almost guarantee your art doesn't suck.
Why?
Because art is different for everyone, you can see it from all kinds of perspectives. And so there will always be people who appreciate your art (and considering people support you, I think you should listen to them. They like your art!)
Just don't give up, keep pushing through, keep practising, and show them how fudging amazing you actually are.
Art takes practise. I don't speak from experience because I gave up drawing a long time ago, and I wish I hadn't. My sister didn't give up, and holy crap, her art is amazing. And (pls don't tell her) I must say, her first pieces weren't that awesome either. It just takes lots and lots of practise and willpower.
Besides, with everything you do, the first few pieces will suck (I don't know how long you've been drawing though). Point is, just because it might suck now (which it probably doesn't) doesn't mean you can't get better! Maybe look at the firs things you drew, see how much you developed, and just imagine how much further you could develop if you just push through!

About your future: Just go with the flow. Don't think too much about your future, it's only going to nag on you. Whatever happens, happens, and you will find a way to work with whatever is going on.
I have no idea what my future is going to look like either. It kind of sucks, but also not, because guess what? That means there are still so many awesome possibilities! All I know, is that in my case, I study psychology, I'm hopefully gonna get my degree, maybe hopefully find a girlfriend, get a few cats, and thats it. I might get a doctors degree, which I'm hoping for right now, or I might drop out and end up working in a supermarket or whathever, but whatever happens, it's gonna be okay, because I know that whatever I'm going to choose will have a damn good reason behind it. 

And about the dreaming: Yes that sucks lol.
I have multiple crushes (like, famous crushes) and some are in the back of my mind from like when I was ten or so, and sometimes I have a dream and I'm like 'YESS THIS IS MY CHANCE' and then they are being friendly and stuff... But all we end up doing is hold hands or paint something or whatever, things that you can also do with your purely platonic friends. And then I wake up. Like. WHY?
So I get where you're coming from.

In the future you should really look into what it means to not only have a dog, but also things you should know about the breed, how tonproperly train, if you have enough money to spend on him, healthcare, and if you have enough time for him. (And also adopt a stray, not puppies who are bred, there are a lot of amazing dogs who need a new family, and by going to a breeder you're only supporting the puppy mills and making sure more puppies are being bred while there are lots of strays who need a home. But that's beside the point.)

But I think if you kept him and things got worse, it would make you more of an asshole than when you give him up for adoption where he hopefully ends up in a loving family.
Just really think everything through next time.

Edit cause I thought this was the AmITheAsshole sub haha"
