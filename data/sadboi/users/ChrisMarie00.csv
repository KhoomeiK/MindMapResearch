AskReddit,eoij96g,t3_bs3gyx,1558620932.0,"Heres some context. 

Hi Reddit! I need some help. I was offered a wonderful job opportunity working at a private fishing lodge from June-September for double the money I make now. The only thing is... its located across the country. They want me to leave ASAP to start my shifts, but I still have to tell my bestfriend. She is a few years younger than me (I am 23, she is 19) and has basically been leaning on me for over a year. She is very shy and introverted and the only times she gets out and does things is when I drag her out. We also happen to be roommates. So she would be losing a summer buddy and a roomie (rent and bills will still be paid for as the lease is actually mine). I know how she is and I know she is going to get pissy with me. I'm afraid she will freak out and move out of my place and end our friendship over this."
