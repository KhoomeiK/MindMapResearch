ZeroWaste,fqgvd8x,t1_fqgch5p,1589358422.0,"Yeah this is also something I struggle with. It’s like I wanna be vegan so that I don’t rely on killing animals (also because it’s easier to be zero-waste while being vegan in my experience hahah), but also a lot of vegan sources of protein aren’t ethically sourced, so in the process of trying to save an animal I’m helping cripple the economy of some third-world country just so that I can eat strawberries in December! That combined with all the materials it took just to ship all these obscure vegan foods tommy grocery store, sometimes it feels like the only truly zero-waste, eco-minimalist, vegan thing that I can eat is the grass in my backyard hahah

I hope you figure out the whole eco-minimalist/vegan identity situation though!"
ZeroWaste,fqgv04q,t1_fqfq31x,1589358061.0,"Yeah that’s true. Starting to transition to being a minimalist involves getting rid of a lot of possessions, and that isn’t especially zero waste in some cases. I think that you can still be zero waste throughout that process though, because you can donate or sell a lot of your possessions instead of dropping it in the trash."

The only reason that I advocate for veganism instead of your lifestyle is because not every family has access the animals that your family can hunt for, so those types of families would probably turn to the massive meat industry, which is just terrible for the environment (and for the animals)

Also I’ll definitely look into better sources for alternative proteins now, so thanks for bringing that up :)

Of course when it comes to the minimalism thing I agree with you completely, but another commenter framed it nicely when they said how they still keep a lot of materials for hobbies and they’re still zero waste even though they’re technically not a minimalist, so that was really cool

For your first question, it honestly hasn’t saved me that much money! If anything it costs a little bit more to buy things like plastic-free soaps online. The one way it has saved me money is that it stops me from buying things that I would normally buy because I don’t want the extra plastic. Instead I find myself making things at home. It’s cheaper to buy brownie ingredients and make brownies than it is to buy a single one wrapped in plastic.

For your second question, it has made me way happier. It really feels like an accomplishment to go from a full garbage bag a week, to making the same bag last over three weeks! It’s also fun to feel like a part of a community that really cares about the planet and about making an impact. Now that I’ve started going zero waste, I can’t imagine ever going back."

Clearly your daughter missed out on so much of her childhood, and that is something that she will never get back.

Your daughter has every right to be furious, but it sounds like your husband is finally trying. Her response to his genuine attempt to recover was not appropriate. 

Addiction is complex and can be immeasurably difficult. Your daughter had to deal with the consequences of this growing up, and she has no obligation to forgive you nor does she have an obligation to change her wedding venue, but that does not make it okay for her to respond now, as an adult, by inflicting another immeasurable amount of pain on a person who is trying to do better by saying all those terrible things.

But anti-vaxxers are just gunna see this shirt and be bothered by the fact that it is throwing around the idea of children dying solely to prove a point that could instead be proven in many other, much more effective ways.

At the very least, imagine an unvaccinated child seeing this shirt out on the street or something.
