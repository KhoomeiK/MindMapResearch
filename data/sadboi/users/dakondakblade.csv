You'll get to Levequests and such when it's told to you in game, until then just do the MSQ and side quests for your level.

You mentioned you want to be a Dark Knight, Sam, Dark Mage etc, correct?

So DK is a tank, BM and Sam are DPS.

From those, I'd start out as a Thermaturge ( I butchered the spelling lmao ) that level 30 quest leads to becoming a BM as your job.

Dark Knight you can only unlock at level 50 and same with Sam.

There's a ton of ways to get XP, but until you unlock your first dungeon, just do the MSQ and side quests, and don't forget to pop any xp bonuses you have."
ffxiv,fp520qo,t1_fp510jo,1588313785.0,"Nah it's cross play between PC and PS4. I think it has PS3 as well, but if memory serves they dropped support from Heavensward onwards lol

The running gag back in 2015 was ""the real game begins after level 50"" and they're right.

Up to that point you are working on your char, fleshing out the story etc, after 50 is when the end game kicks in and things get even more fun ( and grindy )

A few tips I can think of 

1- Just like in most RPG's, don't buy new gear at every new town you visit. The way this game is designed, you'll get decent gear from the Main story/side quests and then dungeons and such will drop gear ( which you roll on )

2- Do some research into what you want to play as. There's three main roles, DPS, tank and healer. Healer and tank get priority in dungeon ques, DPS is literally, just murder and kill some more lol. My main is a dragoon, and once I hit 80, I'm going to spec into a gunbreaker.

3- Speaking of classes/jobs, this game is..  unique. In most MMO when you pick a class, you're stuck with it. This one is different. You pick your main class, and when you reach a certain point in the story, you can branch into other classes. That means a large chunk of the people who have 1000+ hours have multiple jobs/classes at 80. Speaking of that..

4- You have classes ( Archer, pugilist, lancer etc ) then you have ""Jobs"" 
You start off in an area (Depending what class you pick) and do the MSQ and your ""class"" quests up to 30. When you hit 30, you get a quest to unlock your ""job"" 

The skills from the class, carry over to the job + you get new ones + new armour + better stats.

As an example, if you want a tank, you can start as a Gladiator, and then at 30 do the quest to become a Pally. Or if you want DPS you can start as a lancer, then at 30 become a dragoon. 

When you pick your class during char creation, it'll show you the base classes and the ""job"" armour for that class.

If you're new to MMO's, a standard DPS is probably what I'd aim for. You learn your rotations throughout the game up to 30 and it's pretty much "" go in dungeon, trial, raid, spank enemies/boss, don't stand in circles/marks or targets on ground, spank boss"" 

The expansions added new jobs, but since you're new to the game, I'd pick something you feel comfortable with.

Also keep in mind one thing, if you make a new char on a preferred world, you can't swap to a new world for 90 days.

The XP bonus lasts up to level 60 ( level cap is 80 ) which means getting through the large chunk of the main story and first DLC will be doable, but then you're going to need to rely on food and other forms of XP  for anything post Heavensward ( main quests, roulettes, challenge logs, grinding.. .oh so much grinding haha )"
ffxiv,fp4z9bu,t1_fp4ytwf,1588311441.0,"The XP boost is pretty handy haha.

But if you do end up coming to Aether toss me a message here and we can meet up in game.

My friend has an FC on Faerie, and I'm pretty sure she'll have no issues with you joining as well. 

I took that break and it's nice and fun again lol."
ffxiv,fp4yj15,t1_fp4xydt,1588310840.0,"A rough example is

In FF XIV you have servers and data centres. A Data centre is a cluster of servers, while the servers themself in FF tradition are ""worlds"" and usually named after FF specific creatures/things. (Things like Bahamut, Goblin, Cactuar etc ) 

The Data Centres are split up. I believe there's 3 for NA, 2 for EU and 2 for SEA ( Asia) 

The nice thing about ""data centers"" is that if I was to go Faerie ( as an example ) and you went to anything else under the Aether data centre, we could still talk to each other via linkshell/mog mail and I believe in an upcoming patch we can play together.

FC is called a ""Free Company"" and it's this games version of a ""clan or guild""

Gives you people to play with and depending on the FC other bonuses. (Housing, events/give aways, players to help with trials,dungeons raids) 

I'm currently on the ""Primal"" data centre. But.. it's just not that active ( for me at least ) I'm moving to the Aether data centre friday aft/evening, which is where a few of my old friends ( from 2015 ) are.

Anyone can correct me if I'm wrong, but that's main gist of it.

FC's aren't to be confused with GC btw. A grand company is the affilation you choose when you get to a certain point in the story line. That leads to its own things like representing that GC in PVP, specific quests to the GC specific loot etc."

A lot of people have speculated you get a ""new"" darkness subclass/our current ones are tinged with darkness.  


What if it's even more off key? Where when you're in a darkness zone ( ie can't respawn ) when you're about to wipe, you are resurrected but as ""darkness.""  


You get a dark overshield, dark health etc. Here's the cool part. You CAN use your abilities/super, but it permanently eats your health (for the encounter at least) and just like in Crota, you can't regen it without an artifact.

Literally call it ""Season of Rejuvenation"" and make it a season about fixing the core/base game. The Sept DLC sounds pretty awesome ( presuming it's Sept ) let's make sure the game is in a good place before we get there.

1- Don't link together jump and dragon fire ( throw them in between combos )   
2- I have two combos essentially ( the disembowel, and the vorpal)   


So based on that, my ""order"" would be something along the lines of this   


battle litany  
blood bath   
(Cast those before a fight, maybe use elusive jump to get there)

blood of the dragon  
True Trust  
Jump  
disembowel  
Spineshatter drive  
chaos thrust  
Dragon Fire Dive   
wheeling thrust  
(Open with this combo above)  
true thrust  
vorpal thrust  
full thrust  
Jump  
fang and claw  
(Go in to this one, and then I should be able to proc the first combo again)  
Although I'm guessing the second jump is not necessary at that point.  


And with Wheeling Thrust and F&C, I don't need to reproc BOTD because they add an extra 10 sec to the counter.  


So I was on the right track above ( with the skills to use ) but I needed to revise the order. When I last played it was some insane 20+ rotation, the above is much more manageable.

battle littany  
blood bath   
blood of the dragon  
True Trust  
disembowel  
chaos thrust

Anyone have a decent level 55 ( I'm 58 and just started doing a few quests in the Gundu area ) to 60 combo or resource I can check out?   


I threw together this one cause it makes logical sense, but always open to help/critique.  


battle littany   
blood bath   
blood of the dragon   
true thrust   
vorpal thrust   
full thrust   
disembowel   
chaos thrust   
blood of the dragon   
spineshatter drive   
jump   
dragonfire dive

My logic is get BOTD up because it's going to buff almost the entire combo, get through the first rotation , then right after using chaos thrust once or twice, recast BOTD to get the full damage for spineshatter and jump, lead into dragon fire, then repeat with BOTD (if it's up ) or from the True thrust combo.  


It seems to do ok ( nowhere as amazing as my old rotation was back then) against single targets, ""decent"" against 2 targets, and I get my shit stomped in with multiple targets.

DestinyTheGame,fk98kbr,t1_fk97ybu,1583970932.0,"Those are some really good points. 

The emblem change is both a good and a bad thing. It sucks having certain things ( say your army of one medals ) not being able to be shown. But some of my friends are also happy they can use specific nightfall emblems without it showing their highest score. Whether that be for good or bad reasons. 

I personally love the Last Wish emblem, but I used to hate wearing it because I have a decently large chunk of clears and didn't want people to feel self conscious or feel like I was bragging. This new emblem concept means I can wear that emblem and not have that number show.

You've got me on the bounties. I think ever since they introduced the seasonal pass model, they can increase the power level to 2000, but it wont matter since bounties are the easiest/most effective way to farm XP. 

The new weapons have some ok perks but for the most part, they're.. average at best. That's the one part that worries me, because with the whole 9-15 month rotation thing, we might be forced to use rolls that wont be as effective for our playstyles. 

We'll have to wait and see.

And my aplogies for the PVE/PVP thing. I've seen that same diatribe on facebook and discord and people whining non stop about how PVE has nothing to do. I'll refrain from commenting on that in this topic."
DestinyTheGame,fk97qu1,t1_fk974jt,1583970456.0,"That makes the point even more valid. Why are people so butt hurt that PVP players finally get something new? 

I legit don't understand. In the entirety of Destiny 2 so far, we've had over double the amount of raids from D1 ( If you want to remove the raid lairs and just count the Year 2 raids and Levi that's fair, but in that case remove Crota cause that's a strike haha ) 

Just let the PVP players have their moment to have something to look forward to. They've really had almost nothing since Forsaken."
DestinyTheGame,fk9714o,t3_fgytkv,1583970030.0,"The complete irony in this.. is that for a PVP focused season.. PVE still got more content ( this is coming from a PVE person )

You might think I'm bat shit insane. Well here's the reasoning

PVP

\-A new mode + some new ( older ) maps and a beautiful ( but old ) armour set  
\-Flawless seal

PVE

\-A new mode ( Seraph public event + bunkers )  
\-Legendary adventures ( 9 to be exact )-Grand master nightfalls ( 6 I believe, it's the original areas in the game )  
\-At least one or two story missions. ( Look, I know Saint is amazing, but I don't think people running trials will stop the equivalent of a STAR DESTROYER from crashing into earth).. If they're following last seasons formula we'll 100% have a mission or two in regards to it.  
\- Light level increase to 1000 base + 10 from pinnacles. Remember, after the first Trials (and I presume banner ) they're disabling the artifact, meaning it wont benefit PVP players at all.  
\- Almighty Seasonal Seal- Conquerer seasonal seal ( I don't know if it's in game yet, but it's on both DIM and Braytech ) it's for doing all the grandmaster nightfalls.

So please.. tell me again, why people are so upset that PVP players got a new mode?

I've been around since D1 and despite a few breaks here and there, I've been here through thick and thin. Easily 2000+ hours in Destiny 2 and you know what? Since Year 2 onwards ( Forsaken ) PVP people got screwed, they didn't get as many new maps as PVE got strikes.

They have trials back. Instead of being salty, be happy that Bungie actually listened to feedback and let's all collectively hope that it means brighter days for the franchise."

As a quick precursor. I started from scratch on PC with teh boost ( since I was mainly on Xbox one before and my friends that came with me were in the same Xbox clan as myself. )  


I'm using a controller cause of a messed shoulder atm, so sub out those buttons for kb/m.

Just in case it helps, this is pretty much what I did with some clanmates  


1- We ran all 4 strongholds to unlock Tidal Basin  
2- Ran Tidal basin up to where you get the yellow key card thing and use that to open case to get ""Andrestia""   
3- Broke down Andrestia after mission was done ( I thought my friend was trolling me at first )  
4- Went to the District Union Arena (On Normal) today with a friend and on the difficulty screen, held down X on controller ( default controls ) to change it to invaded.  
5- Beat the DUA and the final boss ( I forget the name) dropped both myself and my friend an exotic part of some sort.   
6- Friend jumped off, so I went to GWH ( normal ) held down X on difficulty to change it to invaded, and got up to and beat Puck. Got my Nemesis blue print on the first drop.  


So I either had the luck of RNGsus with me, or it's a 100% drop. I can't double check to confirm."
