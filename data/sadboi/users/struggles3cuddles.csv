bipolar2,fqv5b9t,t1_fovirt2,1589670165.0,Yes it is possible. It just means you have more self control. This could mean it’s less severe or you have developed excellent coping skills.
bipolar_irl,fqv43td,t1_fqg4cgs,1589669478.0,I honestly just wouldn’t. It’s incredibly dangerous to take hallucinogens with bipolar disorder and then to take it with medications on TOP of that. It’s really not a good idea. Look up schizoaffective disorder. You are putting yourself at risk for that and/or seizures and other things.

shadowhunters,fplxg2v,t3_gcaur7,1588721344.0,"Shadowhunters have never really been the good cops. They mounted Downworlder heads on walls, took spoils well into the timeline of the books, though it’s not mentioned, and are just a super bigoted people. In the Bane Chronicles it mentions that they threw away plates they ate on. The books follow the noble characters whom I love, but most shadowhunters aren’t that way. Once you read past TMI, especially TDA, you’ll see just how bad it is. I agree with one of the posts, that the only reason older, and quite a few younger, shadowhunters don’t kill downworlders is because it’s the law"

I haven’t read the books in a very long time, but I remember loving that scene. Mostly because it ends with Magnus talking about how he hopes all three of them can be happy one day. Also because woolsey Scott and Will are very fiery.

OCD,fo9jvlu,t1_fo89i1s,1587621646.0,"That is a huge side effect of ROCD for sure. 

Honestly medicine is the only thing that helped me with my OCD, ROCD included. Therapy is obviously number one, but you really should try medication if you feel safe enough to. It has been a major game changer in my recovery. ATTENTION: if you try medication and the first one you take makes you hate medication and makes you think they suck DO NOT stop taking meds because of that. I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH to anyone reading. The first meds you try are usually awful and you hate them and you never want to take meds again BUT that’s not all meds it’s just that one medication. Meds are truly incredible for OCD and it will take a few tries before you find the right one. Don’t give up if you think meds might truly help you.

This was a big glob influenced by my personal experiences so do with it what you will, but if you want to, please give it a shot. I promise in the end you’ll be glad you stuck through the med trials."

OCD,fnqpbdi,t1_fnq48pa,1587169275.0,"To say it’s not that difficult to not act on compulsions on an OCD page is insensitive. For some, including me, life can be destroyed by compulsions. If it’s true OCD you can’t just be like “huh, I’m just not going to act on my compulsions today”. It takes work that tears you apart inside. It can very easily shatter you. Please try not to say this as it invalidates other peoples torture they’ve experienced."

OCD,fmte9db,t3_fx91wi,1586371251.0,"This is definitely OCD. Everyday I ruminate on bad shit I’ve done in my past, but it is always heavily based in anxiety. Try to distract yourself right now. Meditation won’t work right now. You can also put an ice pack to your head while you do it. It activates the dive affect and will cause all blood to go to vital organs and slow your heart rate which drastically reduces panic symptoms. Look up TIPP Skills DBT. It may save you from this you. Please stay safe and contact a suicide hotline through NAMI if you can"

The rest you listed are all apart of the shadowhunter world, but the infernal devices is the ancestors and the dark artifices is a younger generation that is mentioned in the last books of The mortal instruments.
