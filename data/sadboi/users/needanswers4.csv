If religion didn't exist people wouldn't grow up in fear of Hell for straying from the beliefs of their community. I think that's an important distinction, because people get too caught up in the adult world and forget what it's like being a child. Yeah as adults we can rationalize and make sense of the world around us, and thus come to the conclusion that religion is innocuous. As a child being raised in a psychologically harmful religion, you don't have the perspective or cognition to recognize you are being taught to hate yourself and fear death. It's a major distinction, and it's the reason I think religion should be eradicated from this earth."
