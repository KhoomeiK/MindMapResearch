You should not make a claim like this without a source or you are spreading misinformation too. I myself had never heard of cannabinoid toxicity, and from my brief reading from a few google articles some of the symptoms could potentially be fatal such as vomiting or seizures."

And I think most people like myself use bottles like this because I found it is much easier to drill a good hole with their flat-ish top surface, find a downstem long enough to reach the bottom, and personally Crown Royal apple is my favorite liquor. The design could be vastly improved by using a downstem/diffuser that has a right angle and making the hole at the base, but they don’t sell those at any local shops around me"

trees,f5xcy6q,t1_f5xavb8,1572538967.0,"Its actually printed using PLA, not as strong but doesn't have the nasty carcinogens that ABS has if it gets burned. However, while it isn't nearly as toxic, still not smart to smoke it, so I increased the fill on my print so it would be more durable and less likely to have little pieces break off in your bud. Also this is more of low use, fun to look at grinder."

I am an engineer that’s very familiar with this plastic and it’s uses and applications and I am confident it is safe to use in this design."
