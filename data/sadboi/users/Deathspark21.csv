Also if the pole would‚Äôve hit on the driver door where her head was she would‚Äôve died due to hitting her head on the pole. Luckily it was just cuts burns and very bad body aches.

BrandNewSentence,f47r06c,t1_f47n7wl,1571426636.0,Exactly this. Most people that get small breeds just want something so they aren‚Äôt alone. They don‚Äôt really try to teach it anything and they are treated like an only child. I‚Äôve met a few small dogs that are great. But most aren‚Äôt because the owners don‚Äôt train them. I will say typically it is the trainers fault the dogs are assholes but I have met a few that just don‚Äôt want to be trained no matter how hard the owner tries. But that comes with any breed. It just happens to be that the smaller breeds tend to not be trained as well as the bigger breeds because people who get bigger breeds are wanting to train them.

Of course nobody really get pulled over as long as your across the line when it‚Äôs yellow. But in this situation in Indiana the SUV is 100% at fault. The only way the suv may have gotten away was if this was something like a 55 mph road and they were speeding into the intersection to make the light but even then coming into the intersection at an unsafe speed would probably result in a worse case scenario for suv.

ConvenientCop,f3nxehf,t1_f3nwggq,1571003579.0,You say they don‚Äôt exist but they do. I‚Äôve seen a neon at a track hit 155 on a track. Just because a part isn‚Äôt specific for a neon doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt happen.
ConvenientCop,f3nvvjv,t1_f3nnro2,1571003031.0,You act like people can‚Äôt just put new performance parts in cars that they adore. Jut because you don‚Äôt like a car doesn‚Äôt mean others don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like saying you can‚Äôt tune a Miata to go 180 when I‚Äôve seen it done. If people like a car they will get it to go fast if they want. I‚Äôve seen a neon clicked at 157 so just because it doesn‚Äôt come like factory doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt.also those links just lead to factory tuned neons.

My guess is they were going around 130-150 easy and didn‚Äôt sound like it was struggling. That didn‚Äôt seem to be a cop car just someone really had to be somewhere. I guess. But it being hard to do something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs rare. It could just be something they gutted and kept the body just put new performance into it.

ConvenientCop,f3n7bzj,t1_f3m7wzn,1570995484.0,Honestly though they probably upgraded the performance like they do most of their normal cars. A dodge neon can keep up with their cars if tuned and upgrades correctly. So it‚Äôs not a wrong statement
