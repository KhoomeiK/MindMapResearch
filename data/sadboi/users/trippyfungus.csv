BPD,fmv0a2j,t3_fxf2il,1586402942.0,"One time I called for a referral to a therapist, during the intake interview I told the operator I didn't believe thinking about death, and discussing it is an unhealthy thing. Respecting death allows me to live more, acknowledge that it will happen and that there is nothing I can do to prevent it. That fact that we can choose death or allow it to happen is the most freedom we will ever have. My thoughts now are that I may as well ride it out, we all have nothing to lose because we won't be here to care about the somethings."

BDSMAdvice,fm16xhr,t3_fsbat3,1585673105.0,"So you guys can create your own style of ""bsdm"" or power dynamic. He doesn't have to control you completely. You two should probably discuss it more. Maybe think about educating yourselves further on what you're interested in and then discuss it together. Create your own power dynamic, but please discuss it because things that are left open ended are open to interpretation by either person. Meaning someone could think totally different about one thing the other person thinks is awesome. Negotiate 😊"

BPD,flnl923,t3_fpu95k,1585320942.0,"Of course there are others that have the same reaction. You're not alone. 

We also experience rejection from peoples tone of voice, wording, and actions. Maybe those reactions are less threatening.

You have to take a moment to realize,
 You are triggered, this is a mental reaction and is uncontrollable but what you can do is realize that you are and that how you react in that moment is going to pave the way for your future thoughts and feelings.
Yes people will ghost us, silent treatment us, or sometimes are just busy. Realizing you are upset with that is okay, you can validate yourself and then take a moment to breath and realize you don't have to have a meltdown your feelings are apart of you but don't control you. Take sometime for yourself, fill your thoughts with new ones by doing something beneficial to you. 
 
Your reaction is an effort to protect yourself from the pain but getting lost in that pain will never benefit you, and what's worse is by allowing yourself to react to that pain in a negative way you are now playing into the cycle which makes you feel even more pain."

BPD,flmrp0c,t3_fpscyv,1585293851.0,"Absolutely could not imagine life without. I've had my bestest bud for 12 years. He has helped me in every single way possible. I bring him everywhere with me. He breaks the social barriers, grounds me because I know he's just happy to be with me and doesn't need anything else to comfort him. Has a since of Adventure that matches mine, we've conquered fears together. 
Though he has some quirks, being a curious friendly dog he loves to run off and say hi to everyone. Which means sometimes he embarrasses me and I have to chase after him so he doesn't get lost. 

He is the best thing that could've ever happened to me and I doubt i would've done half of the things I done without him."

For instance say you want rules, discipline, And rewards. Together set a realistic time line of how long you have to research and report back to your dom. How your dom learns best would be an ideal way to report back to them. Be it presentation, written report, casual talk. 

Then go from there. 

Maybe the next week is something to do with a kink you two share. Ex. spanking
Learn all you can report to your dom, practice spanking or being spanked...."

Even when I'm at work I start feeling a weird longing to be at home with them. I can be by myself completely alone but it's just that weird longing feeling.

BPD,fkjod7x,t3_fit0jd,1584252740.0,"I was what i called borderline agoraphobia, I was saying this before I even knew what borderline was. Basically I'd go home and stay in my safe zone alone. My connections with people were through the internet. I'd only go to places that felt familiar, I'd drive my car so I wouldn't get stuck places I didn't want to be, I'd basically walk around stores repeating to myself I didn't want to live so I wouldn't have to be apart of society.
Eventually I realized these behaviors aren't healthy. So slowly I've been trying new things, met a new person, do knew things, go new places. Many times its difficult and I'm not sure if it's even worth it. But I keep trying because at very least I feel I'm living."

BDSMAdvice,fkjf99b,t3_firetd,1584244202.0,"Meet up is an online site where you might be able to find a sex positive community in your area. These communities usually consist of people that have developed techniques to help others with communicating about sex and what they desire with other potential partners. 

To me, it sounds that at this point in your life you are maybe nervous about your lack of experience in comparison to any potential partners. Being able to discuss this with another is probably the best place to start. If you're not sure how, trying looking at s.t.a.r.s a sex positive guideline to communicating with others about sex. 
https://www.sexpositiveportland.org/stars

Remember on the flip side you don't have to communicate this with any potential partner. I'm not saying if they ask don't tell them. I'm saying your virginity is yours and no body else has to know if you don't want them to. And remembering that being a virgin at 30 I'm really isn't a big deal at all, might help you when you find someone that feels right. 

Lastly if you are interested in power Dynamics sex might be something you can incorporate with a partner in a dynamic setting."

As if everything in the world is fascinating to me and I get wrapped up in the human that is showing me this new world. I think idealizing people, plays into this in a huge way. Oddly I kinda like that I'm so interested in culture and that my idealism drives me to learn more about it. Maybe we can learn to use our detriments to get to know ourselves."
