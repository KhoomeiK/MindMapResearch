CallOfDuty,fpslxz6,t1_fps3hqz,1588875703.0,https://youtu.be/O5BJVO3PDeQ        Here is a amazing (1hr long) video that details the full story of no mans sky and the ups and downs it had. It’s a great watch if you have the time. Basically this game was supposed to be the next Minecraft and was hyped up as such with dozens of promises made by the developers and upon launch of the game players quickly found out they put in around 1hrs worth of content in a $60 game and failed to deliver on hardly any of there promises. This lead to tens of thousands of people demanding refunds. So many so that Steam changed there refund policy just to accommodate this overwhelming negative feedback.
