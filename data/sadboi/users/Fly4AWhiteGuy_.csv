I know that in this times there isn't much choice but from my point of view vague instructions can baffle beginners, obviously you can use any types of eggs or potatoes but it's always good to have a clear start point. Everyone has different opinions with this though.

I learnt this recipe while growing up in my family's restaurant, so I hope you like it.

Ingredients :

1 kg potatoes (I think King Edwards work best, but anything will work)

6-10 Eggs ( Preferably free range. the more eggs the smoother it will be, while less eggs will make it 'dryer')

4 small, 2 medium or 1 (very) large, white onions

 Salt (I don't use pepper)

50-300 ml Olive Oil (depending on the quality and how used the non stick pan is, and if possible try to get a good olive oil) 

I would like to emphasise that the non stick pan should be as new as possible.

Instructions :

1. Peel the potatoes. Then cut them in half or quarters (depending how large they are) and slice them, slices should be around 2mm thick but if you are not very good with knives just make sure it's less than 5mm (0.5cm)

2. Peel onions, and slice them (about the same thickness as potatoes).

3. Fry the potatoes and onions medium heat. If you start frying the onions before the potatoes, the onions will be slightly caramelised. If you start frying the potatoes before the onions, the potatoes will feel toasted and slightly caramelised. If you start frying them both at the same time it will be somewhere in the middle, so adjust to taste. Constantly stir the vegetables so they are evenly cooked. 

4. Crack the eggs in a big bowl and whisk them. Add a teaspoon of salt (you can add more or less to taste). 

5. When the potatoes are cooked (they will feel soft),  add them to the eggs in the bowl and softly stir them up.

6. Pour the mix in the pan, and cook it at low heat. It will take about 5 minutes before you have to flip it. You can use a plate to flip the omelette, just place it over pan and flip the whole thing upside down, put the pan back on the stove and slide the omelette from the plate to the pan. It should take another 5 minutes to cook. In Spain we usually like it when the center is kind of runny, if you would like to omelette to be like this just cook without a lid and make it thicker. If you would like the centre cooked, use a lid. The time it takes to cook can vary a bit depending on how thick it is and the heat, so make sure you keep an eye on it.

The Spanish tortilla is done! Next time I cook it I can try to upload a video tutorial. I hope you enjoy this recipe."

Also I would recommend King Edward potatoes, free range eggs, and white onions. Also that recipe has way not enough eggs. If you guys want I can try to upload my recipe."

The times people have been more directly racist towards me it actually came from other minorities, in these instances they actually used slurs and insulted me claiming I would eat their dogs; and I think that people refrained from intervening because of the belief that minorities cannot be racist towards other minorities. Also I feel like usually East Asians avoid confrontation.
