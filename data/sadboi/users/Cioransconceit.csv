Which is why i think the jew were right not to personify it because it becomes something external that you can fear. And it is ignorance imo that produces blow torch sadism. Or insanity. Ignorance because they as I said it my last reply, think the immediate pleasure is more worth it than the future displeasure of guilt. 

>We sin because sinning means winning

Or at least people think it does. I think you can look at something like the anti d epidemic and see that people dont reall have a grasp on what makes them happy or what constitutes winning. Can seewhat you mean about the jack pot and the rules. I think we have to factor in how instituions are erroneously set up for what they mistake as their good. Like takeclimate change. Is it really in the interests of the companies to pollute- yes in the short term they win, but in the long term everybody loses. I can see this as just another example of the socratic idea of sin as ignorance.

Yeah I agree. This is a marxist notion in itself. Its actually such a broadly pseudo scientific idea that it almost couldn't be wrong. Basically all civilizations of the past have been class based and either at some point classlessness and statelessness will emerge, or civilisation in general will be destroyed. The latter case seems likely to me. Any way, seeing as were always in a zoo, do we want zoo keepers who express that they have our interests in heart or express that we should fight each other for their scraps? I'd rather the benevolent zoo keeper. At least then it would be apparent that hes going against his word when they become corrupt instead of people expecting it like they do in liberalism.

>your subjective experience is all the justification you need. 

This seems like a really shit argument dude. The burden is not on me to tell people they shouldn't sell their kids into child pornography for heroin. Wtf bro? Who wants that subjective experience? People who should be in fucking prison obviously. 

> I see every subjective experience, as simultaneously, an objective experience.

I do to. Empiricism can be interpreted as an idealist position imo. Not that i tithe myself to empiricism. Maybe it would b more correct to fully state: i think subjectivity is all there is- just to be clear. So it that sense it becomes objective - in a way. Again i tend to think worlds like objective are just honorific and are synonyms with good. Which makes sense imo, science has done a lot of good for us- it makes sense we'd make up a new world for good to tell ourselves thats related to a component of the scientific methods- abstraction and induction- which ironically aren't what I consider objective, if i had to consider such an impecunious term. 

>Failing here is a bad thing, to me(Value: Truth)

Failure is a subjective notion as i see it. Its not what I would of thought many people even conventionally would have associated with a truth criteria. Also you cannot fail to experience the ""reality of the bliss"" even at te same time as you watch the horror of the rape. Its an ignorant thing to do because no subjective extension of a blissful time period could be worth the eternal guilt any father worthy of the term would suffer. These people would be just telling themselves what they think is a comedy that would turn out to be a tragedy. Btw: please tell me your an antinatalist cat?

>To you, it seems like it's no problem.

Brah! You just made me into a straw man whos okay with junkies selling their kids for H
 Wtf. Like i said, if anyone actually considers doing that- thats why we have prison as a disincentive. Imo the disincentive for such an action should be bad. Maybe let the child decide. At any rate a life of hard labor would be a good start.

>does not latch on to reality in the slightest

As I said, you couldn't ignore the effects of the drug, nor the guilt that you would feel. If those aren't real motivations for an individual then they are what i would consider criminally insane. This feels like a socratic point to me. The person in this thought experiment obviously must think they're doing whats good, but we can both see they're clearly not. The misperception is that the immediate pleasure is more significant than the long term displeasure  (guilt- any junkie would be suicidal after that- thats why they need a life time of hard labor not execution.) Its the old, no one does wrong willingly idea. Just to clarify : does moral realism imply evil actually exists? Because it seems to to me. I just woke up though and I'm kinda hungover so forgive me for any mischaracterisation.

>Better to practice some temperance and prudence on this one.

Brah wtf? If i experience i think it would be prudent ton temper my mercy for the junkie with my rage and disgust and be him to within an inch of his life. Not to mention the rapist. The temperance would be hoe much is appropriate to beat them before the cops arrive. Seriously dude this thought experiment and straw man is wack.

>watch as you fall to your knees and vomit after having reality boot you in the face.

Well yeah. If thats part of the thougt experiment. Why didn't you make that part of the initial terms of the experiment?- hang on. In this situation, you would care more about teaching the junky a lesson than stopping the rape? (I dont think so obviously) but i think it would be prudent at least for my own guilt, to stop the rape first, then lecture the junkie while I beat him as the cops come aftet I've sobered him up.

>There exists a point to miss here, and it rests on the presence or absence of certain spaghetti code in the brain.

We've known since socrates that people dont really know whats good for them man. This is why we have laws that disincentivise people to doing horrible shit like this.

This is why I like 4chan more I think. 

>You don't get to ""just observe"", DNA doesn't share your values.

Dna wants the organism to be secure and reproduce. Observation of the environment is just the tendancy of a highly cautious organism. Thats what man is- the fearful organism, thanks to consciousness. Imo at least.

>Every joke is a broad sublimation of some kind

The fact you seem unwilling to joke makes me pity you (im sure you are though- or at least i hope you are). Also I think truth as consensus is an operable  functionality. Im mean it seems like the consensus of science is pretty broadly believed today, despite people broadly not grasping induction imo. Also the 7 xillion would care about their common consensus I'd expect.edit: on the silenus thing. So even if you think Silenus wisdom is true you think it would be ""trying your best"" to stay in the world in defiance of the truth of the wisdom so you could spread the truth to others?

>the product of evolution that makes winner monkeys-- what I very broadly call psychopathy and diagnose the entire human race with.

We are pretty close here. I think the original sin is fear of the unknown i.e. the snake symbolically- that which gives us knowledge. Evolutionary fear of the unknown is what motivated us to pick out good and bad, beneficial and determinantal things in the environment- basically fear produces knowledge. Thus no matter how much we know, we only realise how much we don't know and more fear will drive us to keep expanding our knowledge. Its an infintie regress of fear and progressivisim [scientific inquiry- it also takes the form of the idea of social reform, the idea that we could continually move closer and closer to perfection or something when in reality liberal democracy just gets closer and closer to techno fascism and soon we'll have ecofascism. 

I think there is a way out of the original sin though. Its just to accept fear- I'm always prattling on about acceptance on reddit which feels like a nice jungian shadow irony. Like accepting we dont need to know everything. Get ready to laugh but I saw a comment on a youtube doco about the amish where someone said- we only need to know how to live for 1 life time. Its struck a chord with me. I go even further and say we only need to know how to live for the day- or even just the moment- or in the passage itself [ which reminds me of the idea of stream entry in buddhism].

>We are all lying, domineering, empathy-less manipulative monsters, as far as I see.

""All"" seems hyperbolic but I see why you'd say that. I don't think were monsters, just animals trying to be comfortable and secure. Animals with a hyper acute ability to draw inferences [I call it the taxonomical faculty- like, snakes were bad in the past, lets stay away from them and call them ""bad"". I suppose we would have noticed edible floral recurring seasonally and thought ""good, more secure, less effort."" Hence ""the fall"" into sedentary societies. Or second fall I guess.

Oh, Now I get why you gave that preface about anti-realists and nihilists. I would't say im an anti realist but an acosmic [specifically the Shakespearean idea that the worlds a stage and the men and women actors]. I reckon a society is defined by the stories it tells itself. [Like the Jew for instance. The only way they can treat the Palestinians like that is because they believe the story that they're the chosen people and that Canaan is there home land [despite the fact that they're not from their originally- even in their own story.] ] That why I think the Dictatorship of the proletariat is preferable to liberal democracy. At least the former has the end in mind of equality and not inequality.

>Don't lie to people

Oh I vehemently agree with this. I was just listening to ""To live is to die"" and i can't help but think of Cliff's poem ""When a man lies, he murders some part of the world / These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives / All this I cannot bear to witness any longer / Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home?"". But I think theres a difference between being honest and broadcasting the truth. Like we should speak the truth, but if we have to propagandise with it I feel like the speaks to a deficiency in the propagandist. It becomes like proselytism. I very skeptical of notions of truth. The only sense I consider myself a nihilist is epistemologically- which ties into how I feel about the acceptance of fear and ignorance as the transcendence of original sin. 

>there's no beating around the bush from birth here.

I would never object to proselytising for antinatalism.  

> I think it's bad if people act in this world as if it's a good world

Why though? They actually believe it is. Its like the proverb ""let sleeping dogs lie"" accept in this case they are sheep not dogs. 

>Behavior has to respond to reality accurately.

It *should* respond to its *environment appropriately* I would say. But people have been saying that since Buddha and Socrates but people don't want to hear it man. They'd rather create and illusory tale about ""reality"" that fits their agenda, than respond genuinely to the stimulus of the world. But the ""should"" I used at the start of this paragraph is so futile imo that its not worth holding onto. You might as well say ""the sky should be purple or I should be able to turn air into gold"" or something. This is just the nature of the animal. I feel like even if you shoved the pic you linked in their face, put it on billboards they'd just say things like ""this is inappropriate imagery for children"" and they'd be right- about their kids but more importantly about themselves.  Theres nothing anyone can do make others respond honestly to their environment imo. Thats their task. 

>every action should have that artwork in mind

Theres that word ""should"" again Kitty. We'd all like people to be more aware and not passing on the virus called life, but thats what human life is- that viral balance of enough lucidity to go to the moon but not enough to see the futility in doing so. 

>the right thing

Well, obviously we diverge in the moral realist issue. I think ""the right thing"" is a context dependant phenomenon, like how we said people should respond accurately to their environment. Also part of the context is the individuals values imo. I agree with the sentiment though. If I would have done the Socrates and plead not guilty and drank the hemlock. Not because I thought it was objectively the right thing but because it was subjectively the right thing. 

>I don't consider myself to be particularly compassionate.

Couldn't help but kek given your name. Kitty got claws ""reow"". 

> I can kinda see what put a bad taste in your mouth now,

Im just passing time bro [?]. I feel like i've divested from the world and am just an observer at this point. 

>Re: ""What do you value"" -- Truth and its exposure, honesty, resistance of the typical egotism of the ape brain, primarily. 

I put this in the context of progressivism. Your dedication to truth is serving the evolutionary purpose of expanding the the sphere of the known in collective consciousness. I'm ambivalent about whether this will really do anything, because, as I pointed out with my infinite regress of fear > inquiry > knowledge [revealing the unknown] > fear > inquiry etc, I'd point to the fin de secile again and today. Never has the miserable nature of existence been more common knowledge thanks to the internet, yet people are just as dumb, egotistical, jingoistic and violent as ever. Maybe thats just the way modern media depicts us- but its not as if the media is a foreign element to humanity, its an expression of it. 

Not that I'm saying you shouldn't be doing this. I think given what you've said it seem appropriate to behave that way. I wouldn't do it myself but I don't have to so thats fine. 

>the ape brain

I was only reading the other day about the brain stem, the limbic system and the neo-cortex. I wonder how much life can support the neocortexical functions its producing, considering the rise of antinatalism, its seem like the virsuses momentum is winding down and extinction will [hopefully] happen soon- not to mention that Gaia is about the send a natural Azarel to take millions of us soon. You'd think that people will surely start to breed less when they see how devastating the climate's collapse is going to be and how much shit we are going to go through. Oh blob, the worst part is, if we get eco fascism, the people climate change effects the worst- the poor and global south- will be the first ones to start breeding less. Then you get an inbuilt kind of racial supremacism which will be used to encourage first worlders to ignore the suffering of the masses in the south- well, its just an extension of whats already happening really. Oh well, should have stayed in the trees. smh.

That burden always fall on the individual imo. Ought sounds very suspect in the context of values, wouldn't you agree?

> know Christianity is false

I'm just a skeptic / agnostic so I don't really agree with statements of knowledge and fact such as that. I get the hole burden of proof thing [and maybe I still have a latent fear of His wrath or hell or whatever- that doesn't bother me, I cant control the irrationality of what I fear- Like for instance I had a nightmare a couple of nights ago about a Azrael type figure. Obviously I knew it was just a dream. That didnt stop me from staying awake until morning light, like a dear frozen in headlights, paralyzed by fear [just as an aside, I wonder if there is any etymological link between ""the morning star"" and such dreams? Ive heard that the term lucifer is connected to the hebrew phrase from genesis ""the evil inclinations in the hearts of men"" [edit: which is so close to the idea of the Jungian shadow.]] But I just view the deity as just an analogy for the big bang, kinda thing. Same shit as Brahman or Vishnu, or like the Demiurge. I read it like a story that it is. You don't have to believe a story to find it entertaining or insightful. Probably went of topic soz.

>There's nothing more terrifying and unpleasant for a Christian to discover that they've been living a lie.

That sounds like weak faith imo. I would have thought a proper monotheist would fear hell the most.

I see what you mean. Of course theres nothing wrong with sharing your views with someone whose open to hearing them and wants a different perspective. I personally dont like the idea of injecting pessimism in to places where people don't want to hear it. 

>My personal approach to life is to express the farce of this hellhole.

I can agree with this as an artistic attitude but not as a proselytising one.

>Shout it from the rooftops. That's not going to jive with everyone

>No need to elaborate great works [-or wail from rooftops I would add]- merely say something that can be murmured in the ear of a drunkard or a dying man. 

Shit though dude. Im sure as hell not gonna stop you. I just personally wouldn't do that work because I don't think I could take feeling anymore shunned than I already do. 

>is is the only appropriate response for me, given what I know

Thats definitely fair. Im certainly more in favour of people honestly knowing themselves and doing what they feel they should than limiting that. 

>If I simply didn't give a shit

My motivation for saying that perhaps its better people don't think about pessimism is motivated by compassion, by a impulse to spare people the brutality of lucidity so to speak. Shit now I feel like the Grand Inquisitor from TBK. I think I can see what you mean from a ethico-epistemological point of view, a kind of socratic point that if only people had knowledge they would suffer less. I tend to think the full expression of that is to realise that there are things that we don't need to know- or dont need to pretend we have knowledge of. 

>what I value

Care to share? I think my highest values are contentment, prudence & sophrosyne (Greek: σωφροσύνη) or moderation or temperance. I think at some level they're all the same thing. I think my ego idea or archetypal tendency is towards the sage but that would make me ""the seeker"" or student I guess.

I just want to say, this is such a refreshing corner of the internet. The posts are well thought out, well presented and interesting accounts of honest people sharing. 

I feel like its pure chance. I think it started with some sort of hubris or conceit. When i was 12-13 (when we start highschool) we had a reading room in our library that was coated wall to wall with teenagerish fiction. I always rejected it and was reading shit from the classics section. It was such a trap, and an in / out group mechanism now I think about it. If you wanted to read something that wasn't commercial drivel you had to browse the classics section which was right on the other side of a set of glass doors which faced the reading room. So you instantly stood out as divergent if you weren't reading deltora quests or sport fiction or some shit. I actually remember seeing another boy (all boys school- smfh) reading the stranger and I got into that. From there into general existentialism, into marxism, into anarchism, into buddhism (socialism became a lost cause very quickly), into schopenhauer. Whats weird about the process is how I dug my fingers into the latter two stages. My mum was into buddhism and had books on it that I just feel like I randomly picked up one day and the simplicity of it blew me away. Got heavy into zen. Then I found a random secondhand book that compared buddhist philosophy and schopenhauerian philosophy by bhikkhu nanajivako. (Latter I found another intro to artie book with their handwriting in it.- kinda weird but its a small town here so I'm not to freaked about it.) 

Honestly though, even if I'd never picked up a book, i think I would have gotten here. I had a backwards childhood in that my mum left me when I was still breast feeding and I lived with my dad until 10-11, then I moved to live with my mum. It seems evident to me that the inverse should have happened. I moved around a lot with my dad as well. Consequently I've never felt any real sense of belonging (except maybe in the green and emerald hills of my youth- i played a lot of sega as escapism). This kind of disconnectedness I'm pretty sure is the basis of my pessimism- i sympathise with Pessoa though, I don't really actively think of myself as a principled pessimist- mearly, someone who laments having been born. I think maybe if I had to describe my thought in academic terms- i would be an acosmic monist eternalist silenite (the latter term after a follower of Silenus).

Theres a difference between accepting the world as it is and fighting the universe.

You make proclamations and generalise the whole species. ""We are incapable"", what are monks and ascetics? Those in whom the will to life has turned. You say, different plain of existence, I think different plain of awareness is more accurate. As long as we allow the brainstem and limbic system to run things and the neocortexical functions are subservient, yes, theres not much chance of acceptance. Acceptance means training the brain to be present in the moment without prejudices. I can understand why people who've never experienced this would be skeptical of it, but its in every religious mysticism I've read into.

It just means you dont project ideological motivations onto life, you just do what needs to be done to exist, to die quietly without making a fuss abut needing a new car, a holiday, a family, prestige, influence or a country house. We can acceptance what life is without that acceptance freezing us in place. Theres no necessary connection there imo.

I think some suicides have just accepted the despair of their lives and the superiority of being dead over living. Some are revolting against their suffering. Again its silly to generalise. 

We didnt have to change anything for the first, god knows how long while we were hunter gatherers. Only since civilization and ideologies (missions basically such as genesis 1: 28) have we felt the need to fight the universe with progressivism. 

The point with programming is what i was saying about the dominance of the neocortex over the lower systems. I maintain it is possible to cut through the anamalistic fight or flight mechanisms and simply exist without fear or greed. This is what ascetics, hermits and monks have been doing for millenia. 

I suppose in an upwards looking sense, certain rare types are capable of such a radical acceptance that they are capable of just letting themselves die. The zen monks who mummify themselves might be considered an example. Or self immolaters- that uses acceptance but is usually motivated by compassion so its kinda murky. 

We can agree to disagree though because its such a non issue imo. Most people will do what they do, never even considering that they neednt necessarily be doing what they are. The few will see the folly of the many and accept it for what it is. I like to think of them as metaphysical infidels. The earth is an abundant  paradise if you just harbour basic needs instead of letting your inferior mammalian brain drive you to get more, to learn more, to be more, most importantly, breed more. 

Just to end: I reckon the only hope is to abandon hope. I've heard, and I agree, that hope is just a denial of a fear. When we understand, with Silenus, death is better than life, what is there to be afraid of?

No need to apologize. You probably dont sound like ad much of an arsehole as I do and I'm not sorry. I may not continue this dialogue because its somewhat of a non issue to me tbh."
