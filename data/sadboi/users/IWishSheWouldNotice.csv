But i really dont have the energy go down that rabbit hole. Doesnt help my dad keeps telling i need to get married. Which really shows he has no clue about me LOL."
SuicideWatch,foxu3w1,t3_g9ylvn,1588156341.0,Im on the same train buddy 25 and i think imma die a kissless virgin. I really want the same intimacy you described but i really see no way of achieving that. No clue how to approach girls in public which seems really weird to me and no one swipes right online. But Im kinda lucky i have a friend irl that is also on the same boat and he doesn't give 2 fucks so that kinda helps cause it helps me get into the mentality of if he doesn't care why should i?
SuicideWatch,foxtc4n,t3_ga4prg,1588155581.0,"Everyone starts somewhere. I believe important thing with experience is not that you preform well every time but that you learn something from it. Being critical of yourself is good but if its self degrading thoughts like ""im stupid"" then you are needlessly hurting yourself. If you want to improve maybe ask yourself questions like Why did it take me X hours to do Y? What were my blockers? What did i learn? Could I do it faster given a different assignment but with the same concepts? You don't have to beat yourself up over one assignment. Plus if you are willing to put 8 hours into something it shows your dedication and persistence. Those traits i feel will carry you further than raw smarts."
SuicideWatch,foxs114,t3_ga2c4m,1588154268.0,God now that you mentioned getting a minor panic attack realizing im 25 now and havent done anything with myself. Don't really know what to do with myself either at this point but i know i have to change something...Sorry I dont have any solid advice for you not sure why i even typed this up but I really hope you can pick yourself back up again.

depression,fofrjic,t3_g739gq,1587741551.0,"Sorry gonna have to disagree with you. I believe the game puts a players in shitty situations based on rng but is relatively balanced ie. if i was born in the slums players around me have the same stats. I feel like balancing amongst our race shouldn't be an issue if we become more PvE oriented because our race is pretty op. As for the grind i think its an exponential curve like in most games. Once you get to a high enough level in the stats yes if will take 100+ hours just for one int but that one int can be the difference between being able to invent time travel. There's are a lot of classes to choose from but this can be overwhelming when you have to pick one, just remember you can always respec. Overall i give it a 7/10 its an unforgiving game so its best to find close trusted friends to play it with who can be there for you also helps with the grind."

SuicideWatch,fn6stkv,t1_fn6j1is,1586706649.0,I would have to disagree the goal of all living things is reproduction if it was survival we wouldn't see sexual dimorphic traits like peacock feathers. Survival is merely a means to an end. Like you said every individual is different motivation varies per individual. What if you don't have the amount of motivated need to improve your situation? Like a snowbunny in the arctic with an inadequate amount of fur should it live its life on the verge of freezing to death or should it choose not to exist in a world it wasn't dealt the right cards to?
SuicideWatch,fn5wswu,t1_fn5sgjv,1586678684.0,who's to say your chances of improving your situation isn't practically zero? How do you get the motivation to put in the extra effort in that situation?

SuicideWatch,fn58zb7,t1_fn3wfg2,1586658825.0,"Your post really resonated with me. My favorite hobby is also gaming been playing since i could remember but what you are describing I am feeling as well. I grew up with mmorpgs like maplestory and runescape and remember fondly when I would get excited to play but everything feels like a chore now. The childish curiosity of just having fun exploring the world has been replaced with this competitive ""min/max"" mentality. ""How will i do the most damage/How do I make the most gold/hr"". I think maybe that's why I feel bad when im done gaming. Instead of having a genuinely fun time you are just left with a feeling of ""I spend X hours competing for arbitrary numbers/pixels"". I not sure how to change this mentality or find a game that would instill that same innocent curiosity so gaming has just been ""bleh"" for me. I hope you find your motivation again and good luck with your exercises!"
SuicideWatch,fn2q1xr,t3_fz0aeu,1586598692.0,"I think you answered your own question. I agree these are coping mechanisms that ensure life can stay motivated through stressful situations. I have to disagree with your opening statement though life can be enjoyed by people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. I mean just look at history peasants, slaves, serfs they all had celebrations despite living in crappy situations. I personally would have killed myself if i were in their shoes but im just saying you don't have to be well off to appreciate life."
SuicideWatch,fn2oiri,t1_fn17g98,1586596904.0,"its a coping mechanism i assume. There will be life as long as its sustainable no matter how harsh  and painful because that's the nature of life. But that's speaking generally, individually its not for everyone."
SuicideWatch,fm14d1u,t3_fs9hn2,1585671775.0,"Well it really depends on the person you ask since ""bad"" is subjective. I can't speak on behalf of people that feel that way but from my observation there are many different views on why it is bad. I'll start with the easiest which is dogma. Some people believe all life is precious gift and we don't get to throw away this gift. The other view I see is from people who believe that suicide is a preventable cause of death. Which is why i think they see suicide as a bad thing. I don't believe there's anything inherently bad about suicide. If you are in a constant state of suffering I think everyone should have a quick and painless option to leave but just like any behavior sometimes our clouded judgement might not make the best choice and in the case of suicide that mistake is final."

SuicideWatch,fjkizrp,t3_fdotci,1583427747.0,"Ahh i see what you mean now thank you for elaborating. So you think that the lie of society is that people are lying to themselves to ignore the mundaneness and futility rather than to seek true contentment and you feel like you have to do the same? If so i see your point a lot of people feel this way but i think being bogged down by these questions is a symptom of consciousness. At the same time it lets us reflect on ourselves and our world giving us more understanding and knowledge of our universe but can lead to thoughts of hopelessness and dread. Everything comes with a price eh? 
I dont think people are lying to themselves by making sacrifices for necessities. Thats merely the nature of life, struggle. Theres not one species on this earth who's existence isn't endless an struggle for resources. Most animals deal with environmental stress with physiological adaptations. Humans have harnessed the environment so most of our struggle is mental putting us in quite of a predicament seeings as how we are facing a period of human history which is very unique therefore we might not be evolutionary well adapted for this kind of stress. Im no expert of psychology so i dont really know what's the best answer. But when it comes to finding answers to unexplored problems the only way to find the answer is to play around with the variables, making observations, fiddling with the parameters until you find the right configurations. Thats how most of the sciences are done to reach a logical conclusion to a question."
SuicideWatch,fjk8t28,t1_fjk4img,1583422505.0,"What aspect of death are you deriving your meaning from i feel like pondering over concepts without parameters leads to just ambiguity and at the end of the day you are just chasing your own tail. Like if i say hotdogs are the meaning to my life theres nothing to derive from that statement. Do i enjoy their existence? Do i like to eat them? Do i like to make them? Am i curious about them? etc. May i ask what's your theory about what makes dying legitimate? Also what do you mean by living in the lie of society? what would be a truthful way to live? I feel like you have a good grasp of how life and society works. And the answers are boring to you and you're right the biological, physical, behavioral, cultural reasons of humans are mundane. But you can make your spiritual reason for living as extravagant as you want. Some people like to believe they are part of a higher power. Some are fueled by their curiosity. Some are fueled by status and power. Some just want to enjoy their time. In the end you just gotta find what works for you. And its not really living a lie to be living even if you realize the futility of it."
SuicideWatch,fjk40vw,t1_fjk2ucj,1583419547.0,"i think the question ""what is the reason for human for humanity's existence?"" is a flawed question so you'll never find a satisfying answer. Life has too many dimensions to it to be asked such a general question and expecting it to have neat answer or even an answer at all. Also i dont think the lack of a reason means a lack of understanding either. what if we understand that there is no reason? and life exists because thats just how our universe works?"
SuicideWatch,fjjhguv,t1_fjjh8ql,1583396253.0,ahhh i feel you. do you wanna talk about it?
SuicideWatch,fjjh428,t3_fdrxvq,1583395790.0,yeah it does being tired and alone for so long makes me just wanna sleep and never wake up...but as long as my hearts doing its job might as well do mine as long as i can i guess...maybe if i do it for long enough there might be some cake at the end. may i ask why you feel that way?
SuicideWatch,fjjghpk,t3_fdotci,1583394987.0,"yea i know where you're coming from. I personally i am just curious of death no need to rush it but i also feel like life is meaningless as well. But the way i see it theres no reason to dwell on the futility of life. Just do your thing and try to have fun  . I dont see anything special in family, friends, love, entertainment at the end of the day its just chemical reactions within your body. I agree with you the things you like is just a product of your environment. But so what why does anything need meaning lifes just life why isnt that good enough? i think the fact that we can ponder these questions emphasizes how awesome the human experience is. but i dunno thats just me rambling..."
SuicideWatch,fjjfz8c,t3_fdrbfr,1583394339.0,im sorry but i disagree feeling suicidal is definitely a bad thing but i think what you mean is that you shouldn't be ashamed of it because it prevents you from addressing the problem and seeking help.
SuicideWatch,fjjfnbt,t3_fdqeqj,1583393930.0,gahh damn that hit home. i question everyday how ive made it this far. i think its mostly luck and the lack of a method i know will work 100% and be painless. i dont have a good relationship with my parents either mostly because they rather fight with each other and pressuring me to be successful than try to develop a relationship with me. so i feel you in that regard. sorry i don't know how to help you but thanks for showing me im not alone.
SuicideWatch,fjjf3ru,t3_fdqwt5,1583393261.0,i can really relate to wanting someone kind enough to care and remember me. i feel like im drowning waiting for just one hand to reach out. but i dunno sounds like you feel the same way. im sorry to hear you've been through so much pain...would it help to get some of it off your mind?
SuicideWatch,fjjedsl,t3_fdqa97,1583392413.0,yo i feel you. college is a very confusing and stressful time. i definitely felt that way went i went through college. the combination of apprehension of the future and staggering expectations made me miserable everyday as well. so i kinda get where you are coming from. if you wanna talk some more i'd love to listen.
SuicideWatch,fja4ujl,t3_fc9dnc,1583166418.0,"Yea i know what you mean. Its really unfair for people to have those expectations without empathizing with us at all makes me want to fricking vomit. Especially ppl who says it gets better, i feel like thats the laziest thing you can say. Like are you a psychic are you gonna help? But then again we don't know our future either. Like a roulette table life is uncertain. Just because the last ten rolls were black doesnt mean the next one will be too. But yea i totally agree life gets mentally draining at times and these empty promises dont help either. Just gotta do our best to endure i guess..."

But yeah can't speak for your situation but sounds like they could have been nervous to meet up after such a long time or just genuinely busy. Maybe it might be easier to reconnect individually to see who your real friends are? the you can set up bigger events from there.

Needafriend,fj601rl,t3_fbq0a5,1583050166.0,I can totally relate with the no gf/no adventure/just passing time by with a thumb up my ass haha. But who says we need any of that stuff to begin with? we are force fed these idealistic scenarios which in the end only amounts to a blip of momentary happiness. I feel dwelling over that kinda stuff only leads to amplifying unhappiness. As for your friends I think they are genuinely busy. its kinda shitty that they said that would come but i dont think they bailed because they hate you.
SuicideWatch,fj5yo36,t3_fbqkeh,1583048398.0,Stopped believing in good and evil a long time ago. In the end it breaks down to stuff that makes us happy and stuff that doesnt.

SuicideWatch,fiyedhr,t1_fiyd4yp,1582837789.0,I think that's a very human thing to want and feel. You don't have to be ashamed about it. Everybody has that nagging feel of wanting to change something about their lives. Its just they have different ways to cope. You shouldn't feel like you're alone.
SuicideWatch,fiydw4p,t1_fixgeyy,1582837521.0,yeah its rough no denying that. on a side note grill cheese sounds yummy tho! Just curious what are some of your favorite foods?
SuicideWatch,fiy2vmo,t3_fagd0d,1582831415.0,I understand how you feel about your parents. Im a first gen immigrant so all my parents did was work and force school on me. I dont really have a relationship with them either other than them providing me basic necessities so i kinda get how you feel. I dont feel like schools for me as well and it doesnt help they're also pressuring/guilting me about school every day. It must be hard battling with such a traumatizing experience and im sorry you had to go through that. Are you feeling any better after getting it off your chest? I would love to listen if you want to talk some more.

SuicideWatch,fixz8am,t3_fabw2o,1582829340.0,I can totally relate. Every compliment i receive I dont feel like its genuine. Like when my boss tells me im doing a good job i feel like he has to say it too boost moral and increase productivity all that corporate bs. So i kinda get where you're coming from. I also sometimes feel like my life is stagnant and im not going anywhere as well. I think its a common feeling in most people since we all get set in to some routine which can make us feel like we aren't going anywhere so its understandable you feel this way. You shouldn't be ashamed of yourself for feeling this way since we all can relate. Sorry I can't answer your last question since im clueless in that area as well...but would it help to open up some more here?
SuicideWatch,fixxqh2,t3_faf8kj,1582828493.0,I get where you're coming from i've put my faith in people just to be let down too many times.

SuicideWatch,fixg9m4,t1_fixb4zn,1582819847.0,"I can completely relate. When i was going through school those line would constantly loop though my head. And I totally understand that hopeless feeling when you don't know anything on an exam. I was in a similar situation, I didn't leave but scored a 27% and most of my answers was just jibberish or blank so I wouldn't blame someone for just wanting to leave in that scenario. I get its hard to feel like you belong anywhere when you feel like you're not good at anything. Thats how i felt when i was bombing one test after another so i really get where you're coming from.

I understand growing up without parents around is really really rough. It must be really hard seeing people around you being pushed away by things you can't control. You don't have to feel ashamed for how you feel, people can think whatever they want they but aren't you so they shouldn't dictate how you should or shouldn't feel. I'm glad you were able to open up here. How do you feel now that you're able to talk about it?"
SuicideWatch,fiw04d2,t3_fa2w50,1582772000.0,I think I get where you are coming from. Low self esteem is a pretty nasty thing to deal with.

SuicideWatch,fivyyo2,t3_fa3bl8,1582771234.0,"I totally agree with you it is absolutely unfair to be left behind in suffering while others are oblivious to your feelings. I don't think it's a perspective that you should be ashamed about either since people from the outside really don't understand what its like to just so simple tasks like wake up,shower,eat,go to work in a situation like yours.  I understand putting a charade can be mentally draining especially alone. Would there be anyone close you can share your feelings with?"
