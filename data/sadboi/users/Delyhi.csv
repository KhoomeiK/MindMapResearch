Advice,fbt32f2,t3_ee4ruh,1577066993.0,"https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/age-consent-laws

This outlines the legal age of consent for all areas of Australia, and the specific rules regarding them. It is not necessarily a crime that someone over the age of consent has sexual relations with someone under the legal age. The parties can be a certain number of years apart, check the link for details, it varies.

What is also important is whether or not the older party is in a position of power over the younger. This is not as clearcut as it sounds, there are subtleties to this that make it hard to determine, even from a legal standpoint.

I assume people here are objecting on a legal basis, and not moral one. That is altogether different.

If you determine via the link above that your friend is in violation of the laws in your area, I would present her with the information above, tell her you are concerned that she could be in trouble with the law over this relationship, and that surely, if the two care about each other, that a relationship could wait until the parties are within the law. Perhaps if the boyfriend understood that she could be put in jail or on a sex offender registry for life he would be more inclined to agree. If he truly cares about her, would he really want such dire consequences to their behaviour? In this case, I would probably make sure both sets of parents are aware of the situation.

Of course, if the relationship is legal, you have made it clear how you feel and should henceforth mind your business. It will play out one way or another and it is not your responsibility to police their behaviour."
