At the same time, not everyone can do what he does. It really speaks to his strength of character tbh that he's come out the other side.

Happy because I have like a truckload of music to catch up on and sad because I could've been listening to them a lot earlier lmao.

I thought that I was going to be biased towards MoTS:7 because it was my first album, but I definitely understand why the boys blew up the way they did after LY:Answer. Such a well-composed album tbh, with so many tracks I like. And it gave us a full version of Serendipity! 

Serendipity caught me by surprise because it's just so beautiful. Imo this is Jimin's best solo song for me because his vocals are so perfect for the vibe this song sets. It's one of those tracks that makes me cry every time I listen to it because it's so stunning and soulful. More so when I looked up the lyrics and understood the non-English bits. Hands down my favourite solo vocal track ever, even though Jin's songs usually work better for me.

That said, I surprisingly like the sound they had in their earlier albums, before The Most Beautiful Moment in Life. Can't say much about the lyrical content of it, but musically they're so well-done. It's a small thing, but I really like the instrumental Interludes they have here and there. More, imagine my surprise when I keep catching references to things they've used in later albums! It's wild.

Special shout-out to O!RUL8,2?'s Outro using the same initial beats to Skool Luv Affair's Intro. And then Hoseok references Ego in the intro and Namjoon uses Persona's beats. Gets me every time, it's so good."

Idols are mouthpieces for whatever music/concept/project their company chooses to give them and they have very little creative control. I would love for BP to show off their own talents a la what LiliFilms is, but it ultimately depends if they want to or not.

That said, the reason why some groups comeback more than the others - ie, Winner coming back before BP - is because they write their own music and are not dependent on their company/producer to give them something. BP have a very good discography, as short as it is, but it's all thanks to one guy - Teddy. Not saying that YG is justified in giving them fewer comebacks, of course, because they can most definitely get it done if they wanted to. But yeah, the lack of control over their discography really emphasizes how BP are not artists in the true sense of the word."

BlackPink,fn0huug,t1_fmw0ckc,1586542219.0,"Makes sense! Also explains why the Black Swan MV has like 60-ish million views. Was expecting it to get more, but idk... unless no one's streaming it dedicatedly? Or the views are getting split between all the other MoTS:7 vids? 

I think your point about BWL being more digestible pop might be bang on. Definitely a lot softer and 'fun' and easy for casual listeners to get into. But I'm enjoying the MoTS:7 songs a lot more tbh, but that's just me. 😊"
BlackPink,fmqw628,t3_fwwpag,1586308373.0,"I just woke up and saw the notification, got super excited for a bit before realising it was last year's performance. It's a bit different though, but still.

I can't with YG right now. I don't even know why I am surprised and disappointed at this point."
BlackPink,fmh7awv,t1_fmeqxza,1586069133.0,"I got into BP last February and the Coachella set was so amazing, I genuinely thought that they would ride that hype train into the sunset. There are people left and right clamoring to collab with them, producers hoping to work with them, and all we end up getting is CFs. 

I miss them so much. YG honestly did these girls dirty. Breaks my heart that they don't put out any music and are models first at this point. :I"
AskReddit,flg02z8,t1_flf482r,1585124803.0,"I honestly adore Hey Arnold to bits till this day because of how real it got. Helga remains one of my all-time favourite characters because of how complex and nuanced she is. In fact, the entire cast is amazingly well-written and it's definitely a show I remember fondly.

Still disgustingly happy that The Jungle Movie got made, finally. RIP the Patakis spinoff tho. :I"
BlackPink,fkbgywk,t1_fka1zyb,1584032805.0,"You aren't alone. I wouldn't say I am offended, but I sure am disappointed. Every project like this feels like a blatant cash grab, especially since the girls have barely any content out as it is. Honestly, I'm all about the girls getting that coin and I get that it's about Lisa's birthday, but like... the timing for this feels off, especially with YG being awfully silent about a CB. 

I keep thinking I'll be less disappointed with each new announcement and this clearly ain't it. :I"
Anxiety,fjzvt7h,t3_ffjt6m,1583731097.0,"I don't like things to fit in, but I sure do censor myself and my offbeat interests a lot. I've been doing it so long, I feel like I can only be completely myself when I'm alone or commiserating with internet strangers on reddit.

I don't know how to open myself up to people anymore. 😔"
BlackPink,fj2sysl,t1_fj1sy14,1582952939.0,Thank you. This basically incentivizes and assures YG that their tactic of doing the barest minimum is working. I don't feel good about these numbers in the face of the recent news we've been getting. :/
delhi,fiwsiwc,t3_fa6waq,1582801073.0,"Hey man, first off, proud of you for reaching out for help. So I suffer from depression and anxiety myself and meds + counseling was a huge help in getting my life back on track. I live in South Delhi, so these might be far for you, but these are all places I trust.

Dr. Alok Sarin is a psychiatrist based out of Saket (look him up). He was the guy who directed me to [Manas Foundation](http://www.manas.org.in/) for a professional, in-depth diagnosis. I then visited [Sanjivani Society for Mental Health](http://sanjivinisociety.org/) for regular counseling for a little over a year. These guys provide free professional counseling services and were critical in helping me out.

Best of luck, friend. Feel free to reach out in the DMs if you have any questions or just need to vent. <3"
kpop,fiwrgvn,t1_fivrn81,1582799588.0,">Part of me wouldn’t even be surprised if their comeback was canceled because the songs have been reassigned to the new girl group.

It's sad that I can honestly see this happening."
BlackPink,fiwra7f,t1_fivu192,1582799324.0,"Same fam, I saw the news on my feed this morning and was terribly mad. YG can't even manage their biggest moneymakers properly and they're over here talking about debuting a new GG? I mean, great for the new girls, they get to debut etc, but like wtf?

BP is the reason why I listen to any K-Pop at this point. I was here for the music, but looks like YG's more invested in using the girls as cash cows. On the plus side, at least the girls are loaded now, so good for them?

Ugh. What a mess. :I"
BlackPink,fim8u30,t1_fim88l0,1582521587.0,"lmao, i'll join this line of positive thought fam 😂"
BlackPink,fif38ih,t1_fickgt1,1582385203.0,"Ooh, I remember the teaser dropping and it shooting my hopes way up high, it being my first comeback and all that. 

Tbh KTL (the song) had mixed reactions initially, especially with several people taking issue with the 'abrupt' ending. I really enjoyed it personally - KTL is very loopable because of this - although there's definitely a rearrangement which I enjoy more. :3 I loved the mini album too - everything was great, although it took me awhile to warm up to the D4 Remix. 

That said, I'm personally keeping my expectations low to the ground for the current comeback. Is it going to be huge? Definitely - us as fans have been starving for music and anything they put out will blow up. Is it going to be objectively good? Debatable imo, but that's just the pessimist in me talking (YG haven't been giving me a lot of confidence over the last year, but I digress). I just really want the girls to get a comeback which does their respective talents justice; they deserve it.

TL;DR Manage yo expectations and you'll be sitting pretty. uwu"
kpop,fiaiaxd,t3_f7903s,1582301619.0,"Oh, this is so great to hear! I don't really follow Red Velvet, but I have been thinking about her time to time since her accident. Hearing news from her directly is lovely. Really do wish that SM are pouring all their resources into helping her recover and that she doesn't make her comeback before she's at her full strength."
kpop,fiahgbj,t1_fi9ukll,1582301114.0,YES. I was crying at how many times he was just left or right of centre and dat dance break centre position tho. Oof. My man didn't come here to play and I'm so damn proud. <3
kpop,fiagydg,t1_fi9py8u,1582300817.0,"lmao, this truth right here sis 🙏"
kpop,fi9pjqk,t3_f78ign,1582275947.0,"My first ever comeback and I'm legit shook. This was powerful and I was grinning the entire time. I literally have no words right now, tbh... just that it was good. Damn.

EDIT: Okay, the marching band, the Hey Na Na Na, Seokjin in the centre - these things made me happy. Would've wanted more of Yoongi rapping, but like, I always want that lol. I'm a sucker for anything that can pump me up on my way to work, so hey. The premier ended abruptly though? It just cut off and I was pretty confused for a few seconds.

EDIT 2: So turns out the stream crashed and that wasn't the whole thing lmao. But yeah, Jungkook's bridge there? The dance break? So good. They even gave my ass a close-up of Yoongi's beautiful face for a bit, and that alone is a solid 10/10 from me. 

I should say that I don't like many songs from the first listen, but On is it. I really liked it personally, definitely will be listening to the entire album over the weekend. Also, will the boys ever show up on tour in Southeast Asia? I'd like to watch them live very soon pls. <3

EDIT 3: I know that my die-hard Yoongi stan is showing, but god, my man is coming for the dance line. I'm so happy and proud. My mind is just ten screaming emojis at this point ahaha."
