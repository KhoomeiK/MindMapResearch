avicii,fqdtsf4,t3_gib3rv,1589296466.0,I remember when Wake Me Up premiered on Radio 1 because there was a specific YouTube of it that had the Pete Tong intro.

AskNYC,fq5splm,t3_ggpevz,1589116418.0,"I had $7k saved up for my NYC move to cover the up front (e.g. first, security, broker fee) and was planning on working the last few months or so before Corona struck. Had a couple months rent saved up anyway after on the off chance I couldn‚Äôt get a job in hospitality but low and behold that industry is messed and I never got the chance to move back anyway. But the numbers are still relevant! You may see a dip in rent too depending on how things play out.

Edit: the rents are not as nearly as high as everyone says they are, by the way. You can absolutely find a two bedroom around $2700 in Manhattan if you know where to look and $1,500/mo with utilities assuming you have one roommate and split it evenly, is pretty doable. Granted transportation, food etc. is still a thing but that $2,000 a month budget for living and stuff is not a bad target."
AskNYC,fq5s5pa,t3_ggnj2p,1589115981.0,"My roommates and I were moving from Boston. Lucky for me, I have relatives about 30 minutes outside the city so that eliminated the Airbnb factor, but we were exploring every option we could to find a place because I didn‚Äôt want to have to do the search twice. 

We worked with a fantastic broker from Triplemint and continued monitoring listings ourselves on StreetEasy every day. It took about three days of Jersey Transit and a lot of long hours, but we narrowed down exactly what we liked and didn‚Äôt like about what we had seen. We were getting sort of discouraged with our hunt but did find a place in Kip‚Äôs Bay that was miles ahead of the others in our eyes so we rushed to grab the deposit because the banks were about to close and I didn‚Äôt have my debit card. BUT we had one more open house we were going to skip elsewhere in Midtown. We decided that we‚Äôd come this far so we might as well just go... the second we walked in, we knew we had found the one. 

It was a pretty big grind because we had showings that were almost always across town no matter how we planned it but hey, we got it done.. The pressure from time was real, but if you‚Äôre thorough, it‚Äôll work. Plus, you already lived there‚Äîthat gives you a leg up because you already know what you need. Good luck!"

Given the circumstances with the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to recut it and release it with the hope that some may find solace in the message of the song. This is a really weird time in life for a lot of us, but it ties into the track featured here which I wrote a little under a year ago called Cabin Fever. It essentially talks about depressive isolation when you‚Äôre unable to leave your environment. Weirdly foreshadowed, given current times. An increasing number of people are sharing how this situation has negatively affected their lives and mental health, which is very synonymous with what led me to write this song last year.

So many of us are now unable to leave our homes and that can exasperate these feelings and you may very well feel alone, but you are not. We can come out of this together."
