BPD,fiiit4v,t1_figjq13,1582422122.0,"Oh, well I do have personal things that are specific to me that I suffer in (and there are way more than 4 of those, haha) but what I was actually referring to is the 4 parts of DBT and they are where I was struggling so deeply. 

If you don‚Äôt know that is: Emotional Regulation, Interpersonal Relationships, Mindfulness, and Distress Tolerance. 

Learning skills in these 4 areas was so helpful‚ÄîI had owned a DBT workbook for years but it never helped or clicked with me. I finally got over my fears of going to group (I was honestly terrified, but looking back that is even more reason I should have gone sooner lol) and learning about what those skills are for, how to actually apply the skills, and how best I could practice them was amazing. 

While you‚Äôre waiting to get in to group, i would suggest finding out which workbook your clinic teaches from and buying a copy. Go through it on your own, and it may help you a ton before you even go into depth! And if not, it makes it feel like such a lightbulb moment when you finally practice and learn about it in group. 

Another thing is just starting with awareness now. It really is one of the most valuable skills we can cultivate‚ÄîEvery time you want to change your emotion from what it is currently. Every time you want somebody else to behave differently. Every time you want to change the past or are worried of the future. ‚ÄîJust notice that you are resisting the present moment. (The times when we are struggling are the easiest to notice imo) and you can also notice, when you are feeling joy, excitement, or new love. Notice how you might be distracted from the present moment. Those positive emotions are also just as temporary. When we become more aware, we learn on a level beyond words that any of these thoughts, behaviors, or feelings are not who we actually are, but are something we are experiencing now. Practicing that often leads to peace of mind, reduced intensity of negative experiences (which prevents some of our impulsive habits) and a better sense of self. So yes, Awareness! That‚Äôs what I recommend!

That sounds hollow, and it‚Äôs not as reassuring as the reassurance you must practice giving yourself, but yes. I am more stable, happier, and a better friend/partner/person than I thought I could be and I felt like everything you said applied to me, and is how I felt up until about 2 years ago.

How? DBT group. I had been in therapy for a decade, and I knew what my therapist would say in response to practically everything, yet it didn‚Äôt help me feel any less hopeless and miserable. Then, I learned coping skills, practiced them, and it really was special to have a one on one guide, see how I should apply it to the four areas of my life I suffer in, and hear about other people with the same diagnosis and know I‚Äôm 1) not alone in ways I thought I was and 2) I‚Äôve actually made a lot of progress after a decade of therapy without realizing it fully.

Additionally, I found a therapist that listens, reassures me, trusts my judgement and is really just there to remind me that I am valid and worthy and give tips on how I can practice that myself. Self-care, self-love, self-respect, and self-acceptance all work to keep your emotions and feelings about yourself more stable. From that point it‚Äôs just about practicing healthy thoughts, self soothing, and self reassurance. I found that exercise, eating well, following my interests, taking baths, and spending time with my pets all work better than an anti-depressant, but it only started working when I practiced healthy thinking (which took about a year of constantly re-directing my thoughts. Check out ‚Äúthinking errors‚Äù and work on checking yourself constantly) instead of just living as if life was a chore. It was part biological, part learned, and part environmental factors. Taking small steps with the help of my therapist to figure out how to view them differently, and live differently helped everything."

Anyway, you‚Äôre entitled to do whatever yo want with your body. At the same time, he‚Äôs entitled to an opinion, but doesn‚Äôt get to make any choices for you. If he truly found this to be so important, and the two of you couldn‚Äôt compromise, I can understand the tension and serration. 

There is extra baggage here with you being his boss and having just signed into a lease. It is also very strange that you changing now only adds bitterness to his side of the equation, as opposed to relief that you‚Äôre taking better care of yourself. That doesn‚Äôt add up with his original case of feeling bitter because he‚Äôs worried that you‚Äôre not taking better care of yourself, and that leads me to believe he has deeply rooted issues here‚Äîmaybe having to take care if sickly drunk parents? A loss of a friend to cancer? Perhaps even just deep fear of death? 

Regardless, it sounds like there was a lack of communication about where you both were coming from, which led to a lack of compassion, which led to lack of compromise, and finally a deep bitterness on his end and painful heartbreak on your end. 

Is there any way you could give him extra space for a while (stay at friends houses a bit more, go out to eat, stay late at the gym, go out to a movie, etc.) so he can unwind? And then perhaps you guys could have a talk in about a month? It would at least be nice to know why, even though you‚Äôre doing everything right now, he is keeping his still distant and bitter."
socialskills,fid3dqy,t3_f7lspg,1582361851.0,"I am noticing a lot of overthinking, and some that I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve realized have formed false, seemingly deeply rooted, beliefs.

But first, I‚Äôm sorry you are struggling with anxiety, and have had to deal with a hurtful parent. That is genuinely hard, and it‚Äôs awesome that you are becoming more aware and want to change this about yourself.

Now, some general things everyone can use a refresher on sometimes:

hanging onto other people won‚Äôt ever make you feel less lonely. It‚Äôs true to some extent that we need some social interaction, and introverts crave less frequent, but more ‚Äúdeep‚Äù social interactions that can be harder to come by, but the truth is that when you‚Äôre trying to prolong contact with friends, you‚Äôre just distracting yourself from loneliness, not feeling less lonely. Your loneliness is not externally induced, but rather coming from a place of lack of self-acceptance. There is then a resulting anxiety that fills in the blanks of how to externally obtain that, when in reality, you just need to be better at being there for you to feel less lonely. Do you like yourself? Do you feel comfortable with yourself? Do you feel like you know who you are as a person? ‚Äî start there. 

You can‚Äôt control how other people perceive you. There is absolutely nothing you can do to be a perfect friend, or ‚Äúmake‚Äù somebody like you. They either will or they won‚Äôt. Did that sink in? I just want to emphasize: Changing yourself, trying super hard, draining your energy, etc is a waste of time and won‚Äôt change anybody‚Äôs mind. Who you are as a person isn‚Äôt dependent on those shallow things and real friends want to be friends with the real you, and humans are good at detecting whether or not something feels genuine. ‚Äî Really, all that matters is that you have good intentions, and you‚Äôre treating them kindly. 

For the record, you are not trapped. Even if you have to go to the next town over, I promise you can go to therapy and you can request a different therapist at the clinic. And if you really don‚Äôt want to, there are licensed therapists online that you can have sessions with over the phone, or through messaging. All of this in both cases are all governed by HIPPA. In short, it basically means it is a big fat crime for a therapist to share any information about you‚Äînobody has to know you‚Äôre gay if you don‚Äôt want them to! Which btw, fuck them if they don‚Äôt accept you! You are 100% as valid and important as anybody else! You deserve to feel and express your attraction and love the same way everybody else does! 

Also, In my personal opinion, the Bible will just leave you more lonely. 

I hope you feel better. You deserve happiness, kindness, acceptance and peace. I challenge you to offer that to yourself, and others! 

Best of luck."
BPD,fid068n,t3_f7p4e6,1582360432.0,"You‚Äôre anxious and overly attached. Alright. That‚Äôs pretty normal for this disorder regardless of the situation. 

The rest? That‚Äôs all negative thoughts, and a lack of good coping skills. Nothing is actually happening. 

Remind yourself that emotions are fleeting and temporary. Accept that you are anxious and allow yourself to feel it without trying to change it. Asking yourself ‚Äúwhy X,Y,Z‚Äù is participating, encouraging and trying to to change it‚Äîsimply notice that is your impulse but don‚Äôt act on it. Most importantly, acknowledge that you have to be there for you. No amount of reassurance will help you feel better for more than a few seconds and then you‚Äôll just feel more anxious for having asked. You need to comfort you. You need to be the one who learns to offer yourself an alternative, positive thought. 

I highly recommend seeing a therapist weekly and attending a DBT group to learn solid coping skills, gain awareness, have a more stable relationships, and just genuinely feel better and healthier."

BPD,ficxalq,t3_f7m8tn,1582358994.0,"I understand some of this may be a way for one of the symptoms of BPD, lack of stable identity, to manifest. Though, mine is more so a quiet, pensive emptiness and sense of confusion, as opposed to any external behavior. That said, it would be worth discussing this in depth with your therapist or doctor‚Äîit sounds like it could also be symptoms of ADHD, or another illness, or even developmental issues. 

I am sorry you are dealing with this. 

Basically, the short version is, you need to control your behavior. You may need medication, CBT, more exercise, or really trying any combination of suggestions from your doctor or therapist until you find something that works. This requires external help, and also a genuine internal desire to become disciplined, and take responsibility for your thoughts and behaviors.

As for the specifics‚ÄîJust stop saying sexist and racist things. It‚Äôs 2020 and there is no room for that. Get help if you need to, you may very well have a compulsive disorder that requires medication and therapy. Do not diagnose yourself though. Get help, or just stop saying those things. Also, when it comes to your moods, it‚Äôs sounds like a red flag that you have a title for it and there is a routine of how that goes. It doesn‚Äôt sound like you should behave like that around your gf because it makes her uncomfortable. 

Consider this from an outside perspective. Ask yourself ‚Äúwould I want to be my friend if I were X person? How do I treat them? Is that how I want them to treat me? Do I want them to do the same things to me, that I do to them?‚Äù

This is a painful time in your life right now. It sounds like you need to develop self control and maturity and that is a really uncomfortable process. I know you can adapt to this, and these painful emotions will make you a better person if you let yourself go through them. 

Good luck."

Be gentle and patient. Maybe even show her this post. Let her know how much it made you feel X emotion. (anger is a secondary emotion, so don‚Äôt say angry.

Also, so you know where I‚Äôm coming from: I have BPD and I have learned a lot. It took a decade of work in therapy, groups and in rocky relationships to finally be a healthy, more stable person and find out what works. I have become highly self aware. This information is what my long term partner wished he knew from the start, and will probably be the only advice focusing primarily on your sanity and preventing abuse, as opposed to how to ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù or ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with a BPD person and ‚Äúnot take the abuse personally.‚Äù This is his work to do, not yours, and any effort you take in trying to make it easier on him, only makes him less capable and independent no matter how good your intentions are. Additionally, you should never, ever put up with abuse. 

With that out of the way...

Start defining long term boundaries and begin practicing them now. Be very, very clear and consistent. (When you stop seeing him daily, it will be the first change. Since it‚Äôs so early, there‚Äôs a chance it won‚Äôt all go to shit. But take note: Change, that feels like a step towards abandonment, instead of a step toward him, [yes it‚Äôs usually analyzed as that black and white deep down] is usually a big fat trigger. The worst case scenario is the *only* scenario when there is a feeling of abandonment. This is his issue and not yours. Keep your boundary.)  

Manipulation starts with great subtlety and escalates to extremes over time. You won‚Äôt know it‚Äôs happening a lot of the time, because you‚Äôre just doing favors, and doing what any kind person would do. (think: you wake up a year from now and realize you‚Äôre unhappy, he is your only close social contact, and you feel an unhealthy obligation for his wellbeing that keeps you in an abusive cycle.) Do not let it get you. Do not be naive or weak willed. Continually check in and ask yourself ‚ÄúAre things equal and balanced in my relationship?‚Äù

Do not go against what you want more than a normal, healthy compromise. If you start doing things that you don‚Äôt want to do because it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasier‚Äù than dealing with him getting upset, you are already in eggshell city. It only gets worse. 

If it ever seems like he‚Äôs over reacting, he probably is. Do not engage when emotions are extremely negative. If he doesn‚Äôt respect your distance, you may have to physically leave. Once you‚Äôre safely away you can text him that you are only interested in calm conversations and he can reach out when he‚Äôs calm.

It‚Äôs been a year, and they seem to want to be her friend, and they seem to like her pictures. If that is an issue that you can‚Äôt let go, then you need to be willing to lose the friendship, or significantly injure it by asking them to do this for you. 

There is a chance they will totally see why it‚Äôs bothering you, but there is a (in my opinion, greater chance, but you know your friends better than I do) chance that they will think you are controlling, still into your ex, jealous, and perhaps even a toxic friend. 

My advice is to let this go, or just find other friends if this is a big deal to you.

Edit: Another tip would be to stay off social media. Unless you are using it to advertise/make money, or contact somebody, it‚Äôs a waste of your brain power and is clearly stressing you out. I would say that it‚Äôs not as meaningful as you are making it out to be."

You can not ever control what they will say, or what they do, or how they view you, but you can 100% control your response.

Then check in and acknowledge ‚ÄúI feel ____.‚Äù You can then, if you want to continue the conversation, let them know what you are actually feeling, and remind them that it is your feeling and not theirs, and their perception is not your truth. 

If you are behaving in aggressive ways‚Äîsarcasm, speaking louder than others in the conversation, jerky movements, intense eye contact, speaking over others, harsh tone, etc‚Äîconsider working on this.

BPD,fhxpj50,t3_f588ek,1581959540.0,"I truly understand how it feels to be made out as awful, manipulative, incapable, toxic, and attention-seeking. 

It's simply not true. Unfortunately, many people will not understand, but luckily science is eager to understand us and professional help and therapies are improving. We were born as sensitive and intelligent, and were also abused, mistreated, neglected, and misunderstood at crucial times during our development, and now we have a mountain of work to do to to un-learn the lessons that taught us. 

Imagine, if we said that veterans, who had lived in war-torn conditions, when acting on their triggers and dealing with their PTSD were simply attention-seeking, or toxic? 

I think the biggest difference is that people can understand how traditional violence can mess up a person, but they can't understand how emotional abuse and neglect can mess up a highly sensitive and intelligent person.

Do yourself a favor, and don't read the posts by people who talk about their ex's with BPD. The posters there were lucky enough to have a normal life. They have no perspective on dealing with a beautiful, sensitive, intelligent human who was not so lucky in life. +

And also, don't read the posts by the parents of people with BPD. Most of them are in denial and like to say it's purely based on the sensitive nature, and not nurture-- they are often eager to get their teens help once they realize it's not a phase, but treat us with a layer of fear and mis-trust once the diagnosis is given. And before that, where were they emotionally? How could they not recognize we had special needs? 

So anyway, yes, you do have a lot of work you need to do. DBT and CBT and a genuine desire to want to learn how to deal with your sensitivity and overcome the negative behaviors. But also, you are trying your best, and this stigma is bullshit. There are people who will understand you. It's taking a while, but one day, we will have the help and recognition we need."
PanicAttack,fhw0v2v,t1_fhvxrhy,1581904251.0,"That‚Äôs a valid point, but since we evolved to do this under threat of a life threatening attack, the chest tightening usually wouldn‚Äôt be the part of this process that makes us uncomfortable.

A good tip I learned was that the problem is that we are not exhaling enough. When you are too tense and feel you can‚Äôt breath you try to gasp for air, but your lungs are reaching maximum capacity already. exhale! What do you do specifically? Breathe in for several seconds, then double the seconds of the exhale. Saved me from passing out on multiple occasions. :)"

I want to say my own personal opinion on the very first part, in the battle you were describing between love and rationality‚ÄîIn my experience, rational thoughts are wiped out like a tsunami in the face of real love, and therefore they can never neutralize it. Love will always win, and take you over fully, even within the most awkward and logical of people. That is, if it is truly love, and not just infatuation, which logical people often tend to mistake for love because it appears to check the logical boxes of love. Though love is very different...

Our teeth (obviously blunt and not sharp, to primarily grind unlike a cat who has sharp penetrating fangs to tear) jaw structure (it can move side to side to grind leaves, unlike a cat who requires meat to survive and only moves up and down to crush and tear meat from prey) and digestive tract (it is quite long in humans to absorb nutrients from plants, as opposed to a wild cat who has short intestines for meat to pass through without rotting) is that of a 100% herbivores. Without weapons, heat, preservatives, and a lot of processing, we couldn‚Äôt eat meat. A cat could just walk up to an animal, and take in its fur, blood, and all the flies and is made to eat that naturally! For humans to eat meat it‚Äôs actually a lot of work and is unnatural biologically. It‚Äôs also important to note that humans who do not eat animal products have very low rates of obesity, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and indigestion, compared with their omnivorous counterparts in the population.
