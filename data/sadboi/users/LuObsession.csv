AskReddit,fpw169z,t3_gfvg0t,1588955456.0,"One morning on my way to work, stocked in the traffic at average speed about 40ish  on freeway. All of sudden a red Corolla and a white mustang were driving recklessly and fast from behind. The Corolla was chasing after the Mustang like a crazy for some reason, they were driving 60ish miles at the 40ish miles traffic and kept changing lanes through the traffic. The Mustang was trying to escape away from Corolla but she/he ended up got stopping by Corolla right at the car that is in front of me, then a women jumped out of the Corolla and punched right through the window of the Mustang for several times until the Mustang drove away, but the Corolla followed up to the tail and continued chasing after the Mustang. The closest moment that I could experience like GTA in the real life."

dating,ffxf9q2,t3_evbk8d,1580323962.0,"Lol you have must met my ex. I had listened to her whine and complaints nearly two hours a day during our six years of relationship. I constantly asked myself if she complained about me to other people just like she complained about others to me. She couldn't hold up a job for too long because there was always someone or something she didn't like and that became a reason for her to leave. She broke up with me because she listed out all of my flaws that she couldn't stand anymore, and that became a reason for her to end our relationship. 

I have been single for three years and I have never felt so great. I didn't realize all of negative vibe that she put me into had caused a damage to my mental health. It took me a while to feel normal and face my true self without being scared of someone you love would probably dump you one day because you're not as good as they expect you to be. Sorry for my bad grammar, but I hope to get my point clear."

I'm 36 years old now and still surviving through the daily BS from life. Keep it up young man/girl, don't give up your life too early because there are many things you need to experience before making the harsh decisions like this. Sorry about my bad English..."
offmychest,exfvao5,t3_csh465,1566249175.0,"I know how that feels. I was so depressed the entire last week and couldn't pull myself together in the office. Everyone thought I was in the bad mood or something happened to me, but I didn't know how to explain to them how depression feels like when it hits you from no where. My face looked like shit the whole week, but at least I could put up a smiley face when our clients visited. I couldn't get out of the bed over the last weekend, and I didn't even want to go out to get a food either. My boss was asking me what is wrong with me earlier, and all I could tell her was that I'm depressed for no reason and I'm trying to get better. For some reason, my tears just bursted out from no where and immediately calmed down in next few seconds. I didn't even know why I cried because I didn't feel like to cry at all...I don't know how much longer I can continue with this condition, I am feeling very tired right now and just want to go home and lie down on my bed..."

depression,ex3714w,t3_cml6ni,1565981057.0,It's been a week ever since my worst depression hit. The job that I have been convincing myself is a good one all of sudden became a hell to me. I don't want to talk to anyone in the office anymore even I shared almost every things about my life with them just last week. The coworker that I admire somehow becomes a worst person in the world to me. Now I am just hoping today will be ended soon so I can go home and talk to nobody and cope with my depression over the weekend..
