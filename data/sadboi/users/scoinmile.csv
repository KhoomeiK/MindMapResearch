singapore,f9fzz5e,t3_e4u5ik,1575289962.0,"I think it really depends what you want to do in future. Some jobs dont require a degree, whereas some require degree for specific industries (e.g. engineering). 

If you are dead set on going to a university, then it's important to study what you like, or at least have an interest in. That makes studying more productive and exams a breeze. Otherwise it will be a daunting 4 years ahead. P.S. Most people don't end up working in areas they have studied too!

From personal experience -
I didnt know what to study and so i took a Social Science degree - vague but i liked it. Ended up in a totally different place (struggling with data science now lol)


Wishing you all the best!"

I found it really therapeutic coming to terms with how much stuff I actually had, rediscovering happy old memories (finding things that I thought were long lost) and removing things that don't spark joy in me anymore (i threw away alot!) - its like reconnecting with your past ""one last time"" before moving on to the future.

Also, coming home to a de-cluttered apartment everyday just makes the mind so relaxed and at ease and you'll naturally feel lighter and happier :)"

SkincareAddiction,exg8m5o,t3_cspdkj,1566257918.0,"Hello!

I've been lurking around SCA for awhile but never seen this product being mentioned anywhere.

So a few months ago, I had a bad pimple breakout and went to the local drugstore and the salesperson recommended me to try this BioNike Acteen Quick Pen. She said all I had to do was simply dab it *once* on the acne spots twice a day (morning and night) and wait for its magic to appear.

Its been weeks now and my acne (and its spots) have cleared (not sure if its just the passing of time lol) and so I thought I would share it with everyone here! :) I'm also using Oxy 10 during the day.

P.S. I also included the list of ingredients above for those interested :)"

Background - just joined a company but I feel like i cant blend in with my colleagues well. There's just too much unspoken histories between them to learn, and the topics they talk about aren't to my interest either. To be fair I tried to blend in but after awhile it felt so tiring I decided to back out and boy could I breathe again.

In the end I'm better off alone and I actually enjoy that than trying to fit into a group just to look as if ""I have friends"". Guess its all about being comfortable in my own skin."
