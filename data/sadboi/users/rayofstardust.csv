CasualConversation,fmezl6d,t1_fmeo8ch,1586016918.0,"I have that with water bending. You can use it to heal and create but it also has immense power! Katara litteraly stops the rain and makes ice from it! And they rise with the moon, kinda an night owl myself who loves the moon a bit tpo much.

It also amazes me how fast she learned to be such a good waterbender. (Zuko still has the best character development)

I also love waterbending because of Tui and La. The whole story is so perfect to me. That's why I was kinda sad they changed everything in TLOK.. I loved the story of the original benders being. I know the moon is the original bender for water. But the spirits are still a huge part to it. Same with the dragons. I loved the idea of some people befriending a dragon and the dragon teaching him or her firebending. And love the theory of lightning bending dragons!
TLOK all undid that by just saying nah it were the lionturtles."
CasualConversation,fmeg5mk,t1_fmeattm,1586002777.0,"I never thought about dreams and nightmares in that way.. Now it makes a lot more sense. I always saw it as a bad filler episode.

(Also thanks for the episode names, I only know most of them in Dutch)

Zuko Alone is a great episode too! For sure one of my top favorites. I also enjoy the firebending masters. It shows that fire is not only destruction as most think.

I had a dream when I was little, I was the avatar and had to choose 4 people to represent the elements. When I got to fire I did this whole speach about fire being the element of warmth and hope.
Before I had seen that episode firebending was my least favorite. Now I kinda love it.

As far as the painted lady goes. You are right the whole factory thing wasnt that great. But I just love how we can see what Katara stands for. (Also might be a little biased because she is my favorite) I keep getting goosebumps when the actual spirit thanks her!"

I tried excersising a few days ago, aaaaand pushed myself too far hahahaha. My muscle hurt sooo much right now. But still try to at least stretch everyday.

Reading is not really an option for me right now (only stuff like Reddit posts, they are short enough to not lose focus) I bought some of my favorite magazines. Tried to read one, honestly have no clue what I read.
That's also why I mainly watch kids show on tv. Netflix has some amazing new shows right now. Started with 3 or 4, then just turned it off after half a episode.

I do have to meditate more often. I always think about that when I can't do it. Like when I am in the supermarket or taking a shower. I still try to do some meditation/grounding whilst I am there but forget to properly meditate when I get home.

You actually helped me a lot! Thank you so much for sharing"

Nobody was allowed to leave their room or sit in any living space. They had to eat in their room.. Feeling really bad for everyone who is there right now.

I do have some phone options, but they can't do much..  Actually have a skype appointment tomorrow morning. Don't really know what to expect from it though.."
