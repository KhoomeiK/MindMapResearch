My opinion is, it’s a case by case basis. You could have a depressed person who’s religious and it doesn’t help cause they they’re stressed out about sinning and being pure and worried about going to hell. Or someone where it helps because it gives them hope.

On the other hand you can have a nonreligious person who’s depressed cause they die and that’s it, oblivion. Or one who’s comforted by this fact and wants to enjoy life.

So there’s not a huge correllation IMO, depression effects people of all persuasions, classes, ethnicities."
