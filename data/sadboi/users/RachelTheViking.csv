I have a friend who regularly cancels plans at the last minute. I was relieved when I realized she does this with all of her friends. I honestly think she just has anxiety.

My advice would be to try to point out everything good that she does. No matter how small (dishes, washing the sheets, a positive interaction with your kids). Depression can make people feel like a failure. Sometimes to climb out you have to focus on getting small things done. 

Also, when I became a mom I was surprised at how difficult it was for me to do things for myself. It is hard to find times to shower. Although I'm sure my husband would be willing to take over with the kids, it's hard for me to ask. Maybe if you could carve out time once a week and tell her you want her to do something she wants to do. Like anything. If she wants to nap, shower, go for a walk; don't judge. Maybe she will get back into running which would probably really help her mental health. But I wouldn't suggest running if I were you. I think it should come from her."

TwoXChromosomes,exubjpw,t3_cud2yy,1566581728.0,"I found out I was pro-choice when I was 16, and my 15 year old friend opened up to me about being raped. Luckily (possibly thanks to plan B) she didn't have to make the decision about abortion, but I 100% knew in that moment I would drive her and pay for the abortion, if necessary.

But on a personal level the pro-life laws didn't scare me, until my husband and I started trying to have a family.  I've had recurrent miscarriages (which medically are called abortions), and I don't really think people consider the impact these laws could have on someone like me. The heartbeat law in Ireland caused doctors not to use medical intervention when a woman's miscarriage was going wrong, and she died. As someone who has had a miscarriage that required medical intervention, I obviously feel like that could be me. The Texas law that requires you to pay to bury or cremate the remains of aborted fetuses could affect me. In other countries women are being charged with murder for stillbirths and miscarriages. When you start prosecuting women for having abortions, it's a slippery slope. Because like I said even though I have had natural miscarriages my medical records still say 'abortion' since that is the technical term. This all makes it so scary to be a woman."

Grief puts a lot of strain on a marriage. When I was in the trenches, I felt like running away and leaving everything behind. I wanted to quit my job, leave my husband, and just hide.

It doesn't excuse her behavior, but I'm sure it's a significant factor. 


You guys need to take a time out from these friends. Honestly, it sounds to me like you guys have tied your lives too closely with these friends for awhile. If you both decide to continue this friendship in the future, then you will need to put some serious boundaries up.

ttcafterloss,ex5884p,t3_crggkg,1566018557.0,"I'm so sorry. I don't know if it helps, but you're not alone. I felt the same way after my second. I started grief counseling. And I would take off work an entire day once a month. But for me the depression lasted a long time. The intensity has decreased, but it's still there. The following description of grief helped me understand what I was feeling. 
“Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.
I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.
As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.
In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.
Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.
Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.”"
Parenting,ewyjfh7,t3_cqj2sl,1565882103.0,"I think this is a common feeling amongst most people our age/time of life. Like you, my husband and I went from 2 incomes to 1, and that in and of itself is hard. But the cost of childcare that I would trust is very high. 

Like you, I try to focus on the positives. Our current plan is for me to go back to work, at least part-time in 2 years, so money will be tight for the next 2 years. And then hopefully we will be ok. But I get to spend very valuable time with my daughter. And my husband has the peace of mind knowing that she's with someone who will do everything they can to keep her safe, encourage her development, and show her she is loved. I wouldn't trade this time in my life for anything.

I'd suggest going to storytimes and play groups, if you don't already. It helps me to connect with other moms. And it helped with creating a routine. A lot of the ones I do with my daughter are on break for August, and I've definitely found that myself feeling more frustrated.

Marriage,ev3bu62,t3_ci3b7a,1564192480.0,"Since you used to have a more active sex life, I think you need to reflect on when and why it changed.

I've had friends who for some reason begin to feel self-conscious in the bedroom. Having a baby initially made sex more painful, and my husband wasn't as open to using lube at the time. So I was a bit traumatized by that for about a year. I know feeling pressured by your spouse will definitely make it more difficult to get in the mood.

You also have to figure out what gets you in the mood. My husband knows that a good back rub almost always puts me in the mood. Also, planning something sexy for him will get me in the mood. With my best friend she literally gets in the mood when her spouse does chores around the house.
