If you are dead set on it, I would use internationally recognized organisations and standards to find participating surgeons in the country.

Talk to a dermatologist, talk to people that have had procedures (recently) by the surgeon you want. ALWAYS make sure exactly WHO is doing your surgery. Cheap procedures are usually done by assistants, not surgeons. Over-harvesting, high mortality rate and unnatural results are very likely in these scenarios.
