Supplements,fqi0585,t3_gj1xe2,1589387572.0,"I would be wary of ACV and Spirulina

Reason

ACV - fermentation process is not exactly how alcohol like wine is fermented, but similar journey (with sugar added). The stomach/acids can't really neutralize ACV. This causes the liver to work harder/strains the liver to process.

Spirulina - contains  cyanobacteria  that could (nobody really knows percentage) cause ALS.  It is also a potent heavy metal absorber .  Starting from it's own lifecycle.  Which my guess is that, it is not good to introduce to the body

Chlorella is better and safer because the cell wall protects it. Until broken for consumption. It is very popular in Japan

Also avoid wheatgrass as it is a strong detoxifier, which can be a good and a bad thing for the body.

Barley grass (juice powder) is a better land supergreen as it is a milder detoxifier and also contains a large amount of natural sodium (different than table salt).  That helps with hydrochloric acid production in the stomach to assist with digestion and nutrient extraction.  Also good to kill parasites and hydrate the body."
