Ben10,f8fggcw,t1_f8fgb0h,1574543214.0,"I always thought they lost out by not doing a slimmer version of the omniverse Omnitrix, in the show it's the most lightweight and functional but the toys looked ridiculous!"
Ben10,f8fg3y6,t1_f8ffeqy,1574543005.0,"Oh yeah, even as a kid my one problem with the Original Omnitrix was that whenever Ben would say that it's a fancy wrist watch I'd think of how ridiculous it is, they really should've made it smaller since merchandise is such a huge controlling part of the show and they even have been bringing in a tonne of Alien Force elements so like what's the harm in a AF style Omnitrix and then make the toy/watch out of that."
Ben10,f8em8s2,t1_f8ed94q,1574530445.0,Maybe they could do something better with the newer one since it looks larger.

WhiteWolfRPG,f53z646,t1_f53t624,1571967091.0,"I agree, the important thing IS that whatever goes on suits that specific group and I respect your politeness in how you disagree, personally the only suggestion I've seen for this that made me think ""Yeah that would be completely ok"" is a campaign set centuries ago where every player plays as an ancient vampire when they were first transformed other than that I can see how people would be sceptical and disagree."

WhiteWolfRPG,f53d2zv,t1_f53af97,1571958609.0,"I feel that it's complicated on one hand playing literal Dracula would make eyes roll immediately whereas a ""new"" character heavily based around him probably wouldn't, however the similarities are there regardless as such there's a possibility that the uniqueness of how a player could portray Dracula could change the other players minds on how they see it whereas with a ripoff because he's being sold as something else the similarities may be to glaring for the other players to fully appreciate the new stuff."
WhiteWolfRPG,f52isi5,t1_f52gwha,1571950678.0,"Funnily enough I discussed something that was somewhat similar with the GM at the time, I brought up the fact that in the Castlevania games there are two Dracula's and that one (originally named Gabriel Belmont is somewhat of a protagonist) what I brought up is that their were at least two Draculas (who were mostly independent) but Gabriel vanished and all of his legacy was attributed to Vlad Dracula (the real one if you will) in the present day the Gabriel Dracula reawakens severely weakened and is disrespected constantly leading to him teaming up with a group of kindred and regaining his powers, he could even seek vengeance on Vlad, I felt that this wouldn't really affect the overall lore, there was just another guy who called himself Dracula that time forgot."
WhiteWolfRPG,f52h2fi,t1_f51yc29,1571950299.0,"I think that's why the GM thought he could be a PC, he's not up to much so who's to say this can't happen if handled well."
WhiteWolfRPG,f52gtoj,t1_f52edwb,1571950233.0,"I see your point however another commenter pointed out that being upfront with ""This is Dracula done in a new way"" would potentially seem more original than an original character who is basically Dracula as there the other players would be more likely to spot the similarities and roll their eyes whereas if it's establishment that it IS Dracula the new elements stand out more because their expectations are proven incorrect, there are points for and against both in the end I suppose it comes down to are the players accepting of the idea I'd rather not play the game at all than play and make everyone else uncomfortable in some way."
depression,f516slx,t3_dmfjk3,1571937841.0,I know your pain.
WhiteWolfRPG,f50zm4q,t1_f50wsd8,1571935227.0,"Also the idea the GM brought up was that nobody would believe that Vlad is Dracula, they'd scoff and thinks he's crazy, even if someone recognizes the voice also face it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility that this is a lookalike or copy, his idea was for Vlad to be humbled by his humility."
WhiteWolfRPG,f50yctm,t1_f50wsd8,1571934725.0,"Funnily enough something that I suggested to him was that Dracula didn't need to be Vlad Dracula, the idea that I brought up was to do a version of Gabriel Belmont who was Dracula in the Castlevania Lords of Shadow video game series, as such the idea of there's two Dracula's but one took most of the fame and credit totally works Vlad gets to stay put while there's still another Dracula who's completely separate."

WhiteWolfRPG,f50sze7,t1_f50dqsc,1571932409.0,Also if there's a reason why the Oldman version is associated with VTM it's probably because it was the biggest adaptation at the time of WOD beginning therefore it's fresh in people's minds.
WhiteWolfRPG,f50p7re,t1_f50lefa,1571930806.0,"This was something I brought up with the GM, I even said call the guy Alucard, however another user pointed out that a Dracula rip off would possibly seem less original then Dracula done in a new way as the things that are altered would potentially be overlooked whereas with Dracula there's the initial eye rolling and then a ""Oh but this is quite a new take while still being inherently Dracula"" instead of ""I don't care it's basically just Dracula"" there's points for both though in my eyes."
WhiteWolfRPG,f50ok27,t1_f503ryz,1571930531.0,"Thank you, as an actor this was my logic can you even look at Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee and say ""Yup that's exactly the same character."" Not really because they both made the character theirs in my eyes there should never be a ""basic"" Dracula."
WhiteWolfRPG,f50jww8,t1_f50dqsc,1571928561.0,The Castlevania Lords of Shadow Dracula is also motivated by lost love and he isn't even Vlad Dracula at all.

WhiteWolfRPG,f4yxoe3,t1_f4ywt9f,1571888026.0,"The question was asked merely out of curiosity and because the GM had some interesting ideas on how to do it, to answer your question I'm an actor professionally trained my entire life is about taking characters that in some way or another exist and are someone else's and making them my own for me that's a challenge and quite appealing, the idea was also to make the other players question if this character IS Dracula or just some insane regular kindred who thinks he's Dracula, (The GM said he'd have Vlad get his ass handed to him in an encounter to purposefully shatter the expectations and not make it the obvious thing of ""Dracula is here so you're all on his shadow"") he'd be forced down to a level of ""lesser"" kindred and that fascinated me."

WhiteWolfRPG,f4ywaz3,t1_f4ytz9d,1571886943.0,"As fun an idea as that is what the GM suggested was practically the inverse, a hugely depowered and humiliated Dracula (who's based on the Gary Oldman version so no cape) is forced to work with ""lesser"" vampires who think he's just a delusional regular kindred as he has practically been reduced to one, your idea however sounds like a huge amount of fun."

WhiteWolfRPG,f4yol0i,t1_f4ym24t,1571881410.0,"That's why I was iffy, but the GM insisted that Dracula would be forced to accept that he wasn't better than them (he said he wanted Vlad to get his ass completely handed to him in a fight for everyone to see so that the others don't feel overshadowed and Vlad eats some humble pie)"
WhiteWolfRPG,f4ylp6j,t3_dm7l3g,1571879423.0,My thanks to those who responded you have been very pleasant and helpful.
WhiteWolfRPG,f4yk1v0,t1_f4yi0lx,1571878292.0,"Thank you the idea was for him to be so severely weakened that others would doubt that he is Dracula and he'd be humbled by being forced to work with lesser vampires he also was to take inspiration from the Gary Oldman version so he'd be sympathetic and depressed over losing the woman he loves more than anything in existence, a shadow of his former self."
WhiteWolfRPG,f4yjsrp,t1_f4yi54g,1571878122.0,The idea as I understood it was for him to A: be severely weakened to a point where NPCs would question if he where the real deal and was also going to be somewhat emotionally broken almost a shadow of the legend he's become.
