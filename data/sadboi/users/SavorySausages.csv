My mom gifted me money to buy my house so I don’t pay rent.

Not bathing is a part of my disability, good call.

I never said I was able to move abroad right now, and was referring to using money from the death of a parent to fund it, which they’re both alive. 

Also, I’ve never had bed bugs. Not sure what you’re talking about there, but I did have scabies once, that was picked up from someone else’s house. So..

Who’s really creepy now?

Edit: I did say bedbugs, I meant scabies, how weird lol. Still gross. And it wasn’t years you bafoon, I had them for a month before a dermatologist figured out what they were and they were treated."

For some, that’s therapy and meds. Others is diet changes, the gym or some form of regular exercise be it walking, running, yoga, even just meditation can help too. It can be finally saying No to whoever needs to hear it, or cutting out people that are actually bringing your health down. It can also be in the form of intense research of whatever it is that’s ailing you whether that’s psychology books, related memoirs, research papers, appropriate articles from reputable sources, asking questions to other people in similar situations as you are, support groups are good for that one, both in person and online. Finally being done could be getting sober from drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, vaping, whatever you’re too dependent on. Or it’s getting into a new hobby like art, music, crafts, mechanics of one thing or another, model airplanes, underwater basket weaving.

The list is endless and it greatly varies person to person as well as for each individual situation you’re presently going through. What works now, maybe didn’t earlier, or might not later, but there’s so many options, which is where the “do whatever it takes” part comes into play. One major thing I’m currently learning about all of that, though, is it’s incredibly difficult to force that desire when it’s just not there. Good luck bud."

I got a notice from the city that there’s a lien on the house due to a past due bill. One panic attack and frantic call to my mom later, I call the city and they told me it was the closing bill that the previous owners were supposed to pay in good faith with the money from the sell. So I was directed to the title company for some reason, they pulled some strings maybe and got a woman to find the sellers address (who are living in Alaska now and likely off the grid based on the magazines I get and some stuff they left, things I saw before they left) and she called the city on my behalf so they can contact them one last time. The city told me I can’t even pay the amount (less than $70), that it’ll be paid when I eventually sell. Since I can’t pay it, I never followed up.

It’s such frickin bs that it’s legal and as someone who pays in full as soon as the bill is available, I have a lien I can’t clear."

Their husbands have always called me a friend to them but they don’t answer texts or want to hang out unless the womenfolk are around too. If they were worried what their wives would think (they’re fine with it) then they should worry about me and their wives seeing as I’m bisexual and the implication goes both ways."

savedyouaclick,ezl0abi,t1_ezkywsj,1567969597.0,"I’ve read some countries have a much better situation regarding disabled citizens, with livable “wages” and decent healthcare, a care team, some other seemingly whimsical things. It’s like a fairytale reading about them lol. The American disability system is a long forgotten tire fire that no one wants to touch or look at. And while I do bitch on occasion, I also genuinely enjoy not being homeless which is the alternative."

It’s an awkward rectangle shape and so far tall trash bags are the only things that fit. Even former reusable bags are too tall. As for a box, it is a box lol. And I need a liner for the liquids, food scraps, plant matter, plus my city requires my waste be bagged."
