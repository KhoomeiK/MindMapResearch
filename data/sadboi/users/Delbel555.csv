AskWomen,fi45tc4,t3_f6cvv7,1582134557.0,"No amount of yelling is acceptable. I've been with my husband for 8 years. We've had 4 major arguments all within the first 5 years. Don't get me wrong we raised out voices and some past mistakes were  brought up, but we didn't degrade each other or make the other feel unsafe. 

We both grew up in abusive households were shouting was part of everyday life. After those arguments we both felt terrible and came up with a solution. All arguments/grievances are now had at the kitchen table. They are raised politely and we both don't leave the table until both parties are satisfied. No shouting/raised voices , swearing, gesturing or raising of past arguments are allowed.

You don't deserve to be shouted at. Not as a child by your father and not now as an adult. Not by anyone. Especially the person who's supposed to be your support and your cheerleader.

Please seek support from a close family member or friend and think about counselling for you and your husband. If you want to leave then that's fine too. It's your life and yours alone. Live it like the absolute queen you are!!

Hugs and love"

AskMen,faywj60,t1_faykr29,1576408090.0,"Just so you know I'm a woman

Ask her. It sounds like a romantic relationship and if that's not what she wants then she's being innapropriate and cruel to you. Even if she doesn't see it that way it's not nice and you don't have to be friends or anything else with her. 

Next time your on one of these ""dates"" simply say (insert name) before we go to the movies etc. We've went (places together) and had a great time and I really like you. I love spending time with you and think your (insert qualities). However I need to ask if this is romantic or just a friendship for you because I wish it could be more? 

You need to say you want more than friendship incase she thinks that's all your wanting and says she's not interested to stay friends with you. . This way there is no misunderstanding. 

If she says it's just a friendship decide if you want to be friends with someone who treats friends like that. If not then say your sorry but your looking for someone to be with and you'll see her around. 

I know it's awful to be rejected but it happens to everyone. I've been rejected my now husband has been rejected by people before and it can dent your confidence. But only if you let it. Some girls want to fuck about and play games and that's toxic. You deserve better. Don't settle for less. 

If she's not the one then just kerp trying you must be a nice guy for her to want to hang out with you. It's just a case of finding someone like her who also has that spark for you.

I hope it turns out well for you."

AskWomen,evvi145,t3_cli5gp,1564837584.0,"Don't sip at it all the time. Have large amounts then you won't need to go every 2 minutes. I'm an early riser so normally have about 3 hours in the house before I leave for work at 7:40 . I'll normally have 3 coffees and about 2 liters of water before leaving the house. Iv got it down to a T now that I have a pee before I leave for my 80 min commute. Then once at work I just have 1 coffee on my first break. At lunch I'll drink about another litre water and a coffee. I'll only need to go pee once more before I leave for home. Once home I have another 2-3 liters and pee but have an 8 o'clock cut off. Then just before bed I'll l pee and I'm set.

AskWomen,euvrxgq,t3_chidl3,1564064836.0,My partner and I are child free and so are most of our friends but we try to throw parties often that accommodate the few children in the group. It's good to see everyone even if it's only 3 or 4 times a year. The child free friends are easier as they're more available mid week and we'll throw dinner parties. We also walk  and cycle a lot at the weekends. All our friends plus their kids know they can join and we remind everyone on a weekly basis using out big group chat on WhatsApp.

chickens,eulq7nc,t1_eulojvn,1563905660.0,"There will always be squabbles with establishing a new pecking order. I find the best way is to put the new hens in at night when they're all ready for sleep. Then when they wake up it's just a case of getting on with it. They will peck and bicker but just let it run its course over a day or 2 then it all settles down. However iv never added just 1 hen. Multiple hens means if there's a Bully hens the aggression is spread. 

Also don't be fooled by age. The little ones are just as sassy and mean as the older ladies."

AskWomen,eukbade,t3_cgs3ad,1563885958.0,"I was walking into town and turned a corner. A man was coming in the opposite direction and we almost bumped into each other. I stepped a few steps back quickly so there was at least a foot between us. We both say sorry but as he's saying it, he walks forward and skims his hand along my arm and eventually touches my back. It really annoyed me and I was a bit shocked. He done this all while walking away and I didn't say anything but it's really been bugging me. It made me so angry and I wish I had said something but at the same time what would it even have done?

I'm also wondering if I'm overreacting as my husband thought it wasn't a big deal. It just felt a bit creepy to me."

ants,euaa7b2,t1_eu943jo,1563607942.0,"It sounds like your doing everything right. It's a bit baffling. 

Setup and temperature
My messor barbarus colony started slow as well but then really took off when I moved them to a tiny outworld with a natural setup including a soil/sand mixture. They really love a substrate and they will enclose their test tube with it. I know it's rubbish not getting to see them but it could help the queen feel more comfortable. I also found they constantly put the wettest soil in the tube so must like it moister than I was providing. I also put a big rock on top of 1 cornor and a heat mat under the same cornor of the tank and kept that side a little wetter. I then used a wooden scewer to create a tunnel to explore and they went mad for it. They dug it out and moved in within 2 days. Then the population took off. 

Feeding 
What seeds are you feeding them. Small workers will struggle to crack anything big open. Niger, poppy, chia and dandelion are great seeds to start them on. Give them a good amount to build up their seed store so they feel they have enough food. Messor barbarus get most of their protein and moisture from their seeds. I would keep giving them fruit flies and maybe a squished cricket but the seeds are most important. My colony also love scrambled egg with a tiny amount of salt as they need trace amounts of it.

Hopefully this helps a bit. Sorry I can only help with messor barbarus. I only had a lasius niger colony for a short while before giving it to a friend. But I did most the same thing but also gave them fruit and sugar sources."
