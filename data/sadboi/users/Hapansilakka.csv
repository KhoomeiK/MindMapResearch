I was just walking around and I saw the chimney and thought I want to climb that so I did, didn't even stop to think first, I was feeling so amazing that I trusted my non existing climbing skills 100%. Still was and is my favorite trip :)"

anime,fbaztdz,t1_fbaza3y,1576690313.0,yeah i get u but i feel like it has too many happy moments
anime,fbayn5b,t1_fbavobm,1576689597.0,"i guess, kinda, but for example 91days has a lot of murder, crime and blood but it's not dark to me.

and attack on titan too so many people say that it's super dark but in my opinion yeah there's dark moments but not a lot of them.

also, straight up gore isn't dark to me.

but for example phantom: requiem for the phantom is dark to me and i love it, and tokyo ghoul has very dark moments too, like when kaneki is tortured and they put that insect in his ear, that's dark and i fucking love it."
