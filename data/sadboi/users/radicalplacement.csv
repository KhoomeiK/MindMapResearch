smalldickproblems,fqq0u17,t3_gkaxmg,1589557456.0,"Hey. I’m a female, and I joined this sub because I was interested in seeing how males deal with insecurities like this (in the same way we worry about our breasts, butts, etc). 

The thing that jumped out at me reading this, is how wrapped in this spiral of worry you’ve become. Yes, from the sound of it, the girls have spoken about their partners’ members. But there is no guarantee that a) your girlfriend spoke about yours. Have you previously addressed your insecurities to her? b) her friend told her partner, or c) that the dude would care or remember. 

A wedding is a pretty big event, so if he were to spend any of it thinking about the size of a guest’s dick, it doesn’t sound like he’d be having a good time, or have his head in the right place. My point is that it would be highly unlikely, the nerves will be flying. She would be extremely unlikely to be thinking about it, either, because the majority of us really don’t care. It’s not something that is on our minds when we look at a guy.

Speaking to your girlfriend about your worries may help her to understand your perspective, which is important. 

I hope this helps somewhat, an outsider’s perspective can sometimes be useful. Good luck!"

I hope you keep it up though, you have potential, you just need to put the work in if you want the payoff to be anything worthwhile. Good luck!"

She asked me about it, and I ended up telling her about my plans to end my life that weekend, to which she responded by telling me I was saying this all for attention.  
Luckily, my parents took it seriously and took me out of school for about 6 months. I did also have a very supportive form tutor, which I realise I’m very fortunate to have had. But, man."

AskReddit,fmnn3kv,t3_fvzqic,1586229989.0,"When I was in secondary school sixth form (Y12-13), my Film Studies class requires us to make our own film.

Seeing as my film was on my MacBook, it had to be uploaded straight to the teacher’s computer via an adapter cable. Having connected my computer, I transferred my photos across, without realising that my teacher could see all of my photos on her computer. Now, this would have been okay, but my MacBook’s photos had been downloaded from iCloud, which was also connected to my phone.  
So, my teacher ended up getting a good look at a series full frontal nudes of me and my boyfriend of the time, alongside thumbnails of tapes we took when getting down and dirty. She didn’t say anything, luckily, but it still took me a while to summon the courage to look her in the eye again"
