OCD,fqbabog,t3_ghx2kx,1589233356.0,"Let me also say that I’ve suffered from POCD for years and always feared I was a molester, so I also think maybe being in the position of having kids all over me triggered it, i.e. groinal response."

STD,euauqy5,t1_eu9tl1a,1563632638.0,I’ve been thinking that! Glad to hear that. May I ask if you’re male or female? Just because they say men don’t get these much but I don’t think that’s super true.
