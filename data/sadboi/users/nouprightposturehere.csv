BPDsupport,fozbnj9,t3_g9zgsn,1588187954.0,"I punch myself in the chest, face, and legs, I’ll slap myself in the face , pull at my hair, and scratch my face and anywhere I can reach when I’m having crying bouts. The physical pain of the emotional anguish I’m dealing with seems insanely overwhelming that I wish I could rip myself to shreds.

To add: I don’t like it. It makes me feel sickly gross. I guess I am but it gets to that point because I’m begging people to help and I’m begging for communication and they refuse and it just hate myself for it all and I hate being in my body and mind."
BPD,fozb04c,t1_foz9smp,1588187643.0,"I tried to write I used to love writing especially funny ideas but now writing just makes me really really sad. I can’t sit down w pen and paper anymore and meditate like I used to. 

I think they were toxic to my siblings and all of their children’s mental health but they “did their best they could” even though they didn’t give us any tools to cope and wouldn’t take us to get help even while my parents accused me of being BPD even as a child. 

They know nothing of my ex or who they are at all so to just jump to their side and once again turn their back, even if we weren’t on the best terms, it’s just gutting me. The abuse between the two is so overwhelming and I know that my exes goal and they know I’m not emotionally strong enough to deal with this. It’s working."
BPD,fozacsv,t1_foz9smp,1588187335.0,"Thanks for responding! 

Thankfully, I don’t live with my parents. They actually shipped me off at 16 to go live with my aunt. And since one of my siblings took their own life I’ve basically have been estranged to my parents. 

Specifically they disowned me after I reported my siblings account on Facebook to be removed entirely as my parents got access to their account and started commenting as my sibling anytime there was a post by their friend. It was very very eerie to see a comment from my dead sibling and their friends had the same reaction. I asked repeatedly that they stop posting as them and they refused. We pretty much haven’t spoken since. Yet somehow they got into contact with my ex they never met. 

It’s all very bizarre."

BPD,fmu7gpm,t3_fxgkpm,1586385990.0,I’m tired of being made to feel like I’m crazy anytime I bring anything up. How do you all cope?
BPD,flz5ypp,t1_flz3mff,1585616257.0,"It’s usually after we fight but he never explains why, just ‘I need space’ and that’s it that’s the end of the conversation. He won’t answer no matter me asking what the boundaries of his space are?"
BPD,flut98i,t3_framg2,1585509566.0,"I did this a few months ago after I was isolated from my community because of my previous ex bf turning them against me. People were openly supporting him, a stranger, despite my experience with his narc. They supported him but stayed my friend on Facebook, they wouldn’t even talk to me or ask me about anything going on. So I went through every single ‘friend’ and removed them. In hindsight with what’s happening now, I sorta regret it. I don’t have a family and my current ex is doing NC. I feel invisible, I have no intention of going anywhere to be seen or run into friends. I just don’t ever want to be seen again."

Edit to reply: thank you for pointing that out actually. For some reason when I posted I thought it was an integrated sub for non & pw. I’ll make sure not to mix that up again. Please feel free to remove."
BPD,fls19kc,t3_fqsqse,1585432219.0,"This, it's nice to know I'm not the only one shocked and hurt by those posts. Yesterday I posted something similar  because I went into a sobbing fit all night. 

My FP is doing NC with me for a week now. I knew as soon as BPD came into question that he would start reading these stories with 'loved ones' and he would never listen to me again. 

I've said that NC is not what I need, I can give you space but you need to meet me have way and provide transparency/effective communication. He knows I spiral and I feel like with our 'loved ones' the NC is absolutely vindictive at this point."
BPDPartners,fls0rzs,t1_flrzcw7,1585431924.0,"He said a few times he'd come over and then just doesn't show. Then we he did talk he was trying to play dumb about something I found out, he responded but when I asked for the facts he began NC again. I've made it clear that NC is not what I need, I need clarity for what to expect. 

He's acknowledged this once after another blowout and he wouldn't talk to me said to give him space but he never defined what space that is and I begged him too. He'd just reply with leave me alone when I was saying I can leave him alone but it would help me focus at work if we could set a date to grab coffee or something and he refused until the day that I decided to leave then he blew up my phone. 

He knows what he's doing and how it affects me and he's unwilling to compromise at all. How can I give him space ,when he refuses to meet me halfway, without leaving him for good? I know the relationship is over. I just need him to say it."
