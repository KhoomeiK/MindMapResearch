ADHD,f05bzu9,t3_d3v2oz,1568406489.0,"Hear, hear! I was also diagnosed as a female in her 30s. Also quiet, mannerly and well-behaved as a child.

I totally get the “inability to do anything other than sleep for what seems like days on end...body care?” 

I was super good about it for several years after diagnosis but then fell off again probably due to co-morbid bipolar (spectrum?) and am trying to exercise and treat myself like a little bit of a diva again. Lol"

WeAreTheMusicMakers,ezugo7y,t3_d2ey17,1568151870.0,"Honestly the older iPads should work just fine...been using them for years for similar purposes! However! 

iPads just got updated today (which you may know...) I’d definitely go for something that is at the beginning of its cycle (from a former longtime Apple employee) because you can get AppleCare + and newer software will likely run better on it. 

I’ve used iRig with no major complaints but Sweetwater has a whole lot of newer stuff that looks like its come down considerably in price and now I want new stuff :) 

I do DJing and live mixing so I’ve used some that function both as inputs and mixers.

ADHD,eztuir4,t3_d295co,1568138936.0,"Totally me for years and years. Terrified to go see the Medicaid dentist for a tooth I broke in a BMX accident 3 years ago. I know I need a root canal and a crown but haven’t had proper insurance so I found the “city clinic.” 

The damn spot near where the partial tooth is (I think more of it came out) bleeds at random..::ughhh thank god for the dentist tomorrow."
