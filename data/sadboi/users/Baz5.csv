Nowadays, I'd go on google images and look at homes in different countries and I'd usually have soft rock playing in the background and I'd fantasize about being there, I usually do that at night. Yeah reality can suck alot. I have a job, and car and a few friends but thats it pretty much. My ps4 and netflix is were my head is 90%  of times.
