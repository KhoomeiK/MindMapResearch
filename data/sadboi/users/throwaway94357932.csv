BioShock just had the intention behind it. Real life is like that, free will is a specious, nonsensical concept. Games are not art fellas. I love BioShock, the ""art"" in it just comes with the game, and has nothing to do with the essential qualities that make it a game by definition, and which have absolutely nothing to do with art, like a ruleset, objectives, winnability, competitiveness etc. The art part is the art deco inspired game design, the jazz soundtrack, the ayn rand inspired storytelling etc. It's all subservient and incidental to the gameness of it, because it's, after all, just a game. And game =/= art. Chess is not art. Football is not art. Poker is not art. There's a solid argument to be made they're not games either, with the exception of chess."

Well just about anything is art according to you lot. Why don't you name a game that's art and tell us why it is art. I'm saying it's a game that might contain artistic elements, which have nothing to do with anything that makes the game a game. This is the point:  not one element essential to a game, contained in its definition as a game, can be art. Every element of a movie can be art.

Let's see, music can be art, so can photography and a piece of writing. These combined make a movie, and they're essential to it. A game is a game, like checkers. Video games have a written story, that can be considered art, presented via cutscenes usually, which is like an animated movie, with some music that can be considered art.

The story *is* the film, the characters are the film, the visuals and the music are the film. They augment what's being expressed, sometimes the photography or the music are the very mode of expression. But they're peripheral in a game. A game is there to be played and won. The rest is just incidental. Jesus in what universe are videogames art. Film, music, art don't have much in common with rules, challenges, competition, goals, interaction. Games do.
