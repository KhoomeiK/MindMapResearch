AskReddit,fqr33z5,t1_fqr20o5,1589576692.0,"It really depends on the restaurant I guess. In my experience specials often involve highly seasonal items like asparagus, that is only available in late spring. Or something like a special cut of meat, that gets cooked in a slow cook oven once a week and only sold that day.
Of course there are many dishes, that can be used to get rid of left overs like fish meat balls or certain types of stew / soup. But I would also question, if this is a bad thing. It lowers waste and also shows, that the restaurant cares and wants to prevent ingredients from getting old. It could be worse, if the restaurants just uses old ingredients for longer. 
It should be in the interest of the restaurant to serve tasty food, that doesn't taste off or gives food poisoning."
