My Dearest and bestest friend Wade,

Thank you for bringing me such joy in a weird time that we call year 2020. I know, I know, if it doesn't involve food, bugs or sleep then you probably know nothing about it... but the world right now is super scary and I'm so thankful to be tucked away on a small island with you. You've done nothing but make me genuinely happy and for that, I'll be forever grateful because I haven't been happy in a long time. 

Sincerely, your Burrito Jooby <3"

It can be super isolating at first -- I'm married and have been for a few years now and when I was working third, it was hard to sleep alone since he worked first. I couldn't even talk to him during my work hours because he was sleeping during that time. I'm sorry you've lost touch with your friends! If you want to talk, you can always PM me. I do however work the first shift now but I'm usually by my phone and will respond whenever I see it. I know it isn't much help but it's always nice to have \*someone\* :D"
