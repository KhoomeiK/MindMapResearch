At first, it started out with me having a very strong love for my family and friends. Then it became an obsession and I got into thinking about how I've treated them and started worrying about if they think I don't love them enough. That was only the peak through the rest of the trip I was getting very intense visuals and laughing at my ceiling, especially after I smoked."

SuicideWatch,fkpsq2g,t3_fjx5dj,1584418309.0,"At least you‚Äôre thinking of others. That‚Äôs a good quality, and I know you have many more. Depression stops you from seeing the good and only lets you see the bad. But obviously staying positive wont work so what is there left to do? Well if you take your life you‚Äôll never find out. Deep down inside i know theres a part of you that wants to see yourself in 20 years.. That‚Äôs a lot of time to accomplish something. I don‚Äôt know what your going through, and your life could really be just one bad thing after another. But as someone who has tried to take their life before I can tell you it‚Äôs not worth it. Don‚Äôt let your brain stop you from seeing the good things, you‚Äôll find them in time."

(2-3) 7-second rips - Baked af, usually good for heavy smokers.

Assuming your cart isn't complete dogshit and your tolerance is high asf heres what I go by.

My brain convinced me that im ugly and awkward, and that everyone else is simply just better. This quickly leads to depressing thoughts. The worst part is in a lot of situations my anxiety holds my mouth shut so I don‚Äôt talk that much. Now my friends think im the quiet guy.

depression,ex6c9wj,t3_criuja,1566043191.0,"Seems like you‚Äôre going through something real rough. Alcohol is something special. Usually I have very low self-esteem and am not confident at all when talking with others. When I drink I feel like my personality shifts so much in to this confident fun person that everyone loves. I feel like my friends actually want to talk to me. So when suddenly I‚Äôm on the comedown and reality comes back I‚Äôm more suicidal then before. That doesn‚Äôt stop me from drinking a half liter of vodka then sitting on my ass playing video games for at least 2 or 3 days out of the week. Most times when I drink alone at my house I don‚Äôt talk to anyone I just do it so I can get that amazing rush of being able to appreciate myself more. But always at the end of the day it‚Äôs a surface level fix. Sometimes I ask if being drunk or high is what it feels like not to be depressed, but thats just silly right? These thoughts are what leads me to take any drug I can get my hands on. 

There‚Äôs always a core problem that can only be fixed by working on the little things everyday. I‚Äôm still not better at all, however I did have a good month a little while ago. During that month I actually used drugs, including alcohol, to motivate myself. I made a check list every morning after I got out of bed. It would have things like ‚ÄúBrush you teeth‚Äù ‚ÄúGo to the gym‚Äù ‚ÄúMake plans.‚Äù At the end of the day if everything on the list was completed and checked off I‚Äôd smoke a blunt. At the end of the week if I completed the list everyday I could drink. But obviously you‚Äôre gonna have a bad day and just throw away the list and drink anyway; so what‚Äôs important is that you take whatever motivation your depression left you and put it towards your weekly drink or daily blunt until you wont need it at all. Stay safe my manüí™üí™"
depression,ex66tr8,t3_crkkue,1566040336.0,"Even though you said you know this already I‚Äôll say it anyway. Most men are way hornier than you think after 2 or 3 days without sex or masturbating. Of course that time span varies for everyone but regardless I‚Äôm pretty r/NoFap can agree if you go a week without doing anything you‚Äôll be able to jerk off to your nearast wall. It‚Äôs an insanely hard urge to fight off for guys. I promise it doesn‚Äôt mean your boyfriend loves you any less. He only uses the girls in porn for one thing, but he stays with you an uncountable amount of reasons. Low self-esteem is torture. I struggle with it everyday and from your view it seems like that no matter what your always the most unliked person in the room and everyone‚Äôs hoping you‚Äôll just leave so its less awkward, at least for me. It‚Äôs really hard to fight your ego but I‚Äôm fighting with you. Stay strongüí™üí™"

Even today, for example, I went to an amusement park with my friend. I couldn't seem to enjoy myself an hour or two after being there. It used to be my favorite place when I was younger, and even last summer i has a blast there. Its like those emotions cant be produced by my brain anymore. Now that you mention it I am seriously wondering if cutting off internet could make an impact. Maybe if I do what I enjoy less I'll learn to appreciate the less enjoyable things in life."
