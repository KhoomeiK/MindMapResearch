You probably arenâ€™t strong enough yet to be doing the things that are causing the elbow pain. You need to let your elbow rest until it feels better and then wait another several weeks minimum (I know, it sucks). Start doing exercises that you used to that donâ€™t hurt your elbow and increase weight on those to slowly build the muscles around your tendons and the tendons themselves.  That alone could take a couple months but I donâ€™t think it should affect your progress if you simply swap out the exercises that hurt you, but make sure to keep the exercises consistent. While resting your elbows entirely you probably want to replace those exercises with some cardio (or whatever you want) to make sure your still getting a full workout.

I have absolutely no science to back this up but both myself and my dad lift and have had the same issue as well as had difficulty figuring out how to treat it, but this is how weâ€™ve been able to overcome it.

I do admittedly think it's fair for someone with more sexual experience to want to date someone that also has more experience. Do you have some things that you might cautiously share with him if you were to hook up? Of course, for the most part, I don't think you should judge someone based on how much sex they've had.

The reason I have difficulty fitting Christianity into my world view is that the same critical thinking used in science to come to conclusions can not be used in most instances with religion.
