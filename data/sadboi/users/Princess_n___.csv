The only other stuff I’m using rn is:

shangpree s-energy eye cream

Shiseido SPF 42

I put a little bit of neosporin on any broken skin on my lips.

I am gonna start using the laneige lip sleeping mask, but it’s still not shipped due to covid.

I also use nivea lotion on my body, but I feel like using the cerave in the tub. It’s so hydrating

Instead. Day one, she uses the word “narcissist.” She says how innocent, young, and without pretense I am. (Like, genuine basically) That all my emotions are on my face, and that he loved that Bc I was so easy to manipulate. She said he was emotionally abusing me.

Physically with aging, and mentally with the growing mountain of damage you’re gonna have to deal with in therapy.

Go no contact and get in therapy. Feel validated now. This guy chose you for all your amazing qualities. This guy still wants to feed off you. But he doesn’t love you. He’ll only abuse you. Narcs only abuse you."
NarcissisticAbuse,fql3k2h,t3_gjgqaa,1589445013.0,"Same situation here. He’s manipulating you into doing that Bc he loves seeing you upset over him. It validates him. The ping of your texts.

He is comfortable like this. The more he hurts an disturbes you mentally, the easier it’ll be to keep you as a blood bag for supply forever. Sex, attention..... slave basically.

He wants this behavior. It’s negative reinforcement going on.

You gotta leave. Be happy with the peace you get for however long you last. A few month. Relapses happen. You have to leave again. You were strong enough to do it once. You can do it again. This shit ain’t life and it ain’t love.

You experienced this sick person. He’s literally ill. Nothing will change. Especially not when he’s happily riding the supply high... Bc that what you’re doing for him.

Now that you’ve met a NPD person... all that is left is this shitty power game where he will want you back forever. That’s why he does this. And you need to get away. You deserve your life and joy bsck. To not be abused and used by a mentally disturbed individual Bc these NPD freaks are EMPTY inside. There’re not like normal people. They’re SICK. Get away. He isn’t gonna help you. He isn’t going to be your friend. Try to get that through your head. HE IS YOUR ABUSER. He WIll NEVER be your friend. He will always want to use you for supply Bc he is disordered.

Staying no contact is always how it ends with these freaks Bc they will not leave you alone. Even when they convince you they’re leaving you, they’re not. They never leave! They will always be playing with you, driving you crazy. Watching you suffer when they “leave you”. They’re not gone. They’re watching you. They are putting you on a shelf.

And when you leave....... they never forget you. Especially not if you’ve ever been primary/if it’s been years knowing eachother. They see you as a possession. They think they have a claim over you for life.

This is a ghost you have now. This person will always be in the shadows watching your life unfold... trying to find a way back in.

Get away. No contact. He will never be your friend. Mine will never be mind either. If he was a friend... if he could be a friend.... you and I would never have interacted here."

I empathize so much and identify a ton with what people with BPD say. It’s just all so new to me, and I am really nervous about starting therapy (my first appointment is tomorrow!)

You’ve really changed my perspective and I feel much more open to going forward even if I’m diagnosed with BPD instead of CPTSD. The difference seems so small.

I really appreciate you taking the time to write all this for me and anyone else. It was so insightful. So kind and caring of you!!!

Also, this may be unrelated, but I think part of me rejecting any diagnosis is just me being afraid to heal and see where I’ve made mistakes in my relationships, so I’m trying to run away. But I will stay brave. You’re right that it’s just a list of things I struggle with, and I can choose whether to work on it.

I’m pretty desperate to find out.. I requested my records today. I guess I’ll know soon. If she did diagnose me, I feel like I might just stop therapy and not come back.. idk. Feels hurtful to call someone BPD. I feel like, if they call my issues BPD, they don’t actually understand or want to help me. I feel like they wouldn’t be able to help me actually, because I don’t believe I have BPD. I would feel like getting treated for BPD would just be a nice way of having crazy on my medical record... along with all my private thoughts. Feel like a big “No thanks” rn.
