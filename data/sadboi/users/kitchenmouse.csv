askwomenadvice,f8wogq9,t3_e2lbyl,1574895677.0,Based off of what you said- it sounds like she is not only just shy but probably very self-conscious. I say this because I had a similar experience. I’d have someone I like offer to come over when I wasn’t necessarily prepared or felt I didn’t look my best and would either come up with an excuse or stall them long enough to get ready. I hated making eye-contact and was terrible with small-talk so I’d often have a friend around to act as a buffer and help take the pressure off of me. If I’m thinking of myself as the same person I was then- I’d say you should maybe ask her on a date that would in some ways make it clear that you were interested in her but in a more relaxed setting. I’d suggest going to see a movie or having a game night with a couple of your friends and a few of her own friends. If you choose the game night I’d make sure she was able to bring at least one of her own friends along so she has someone to more comfortably interact with if she starts feeling self-conscious. But this is just my opinion.. and I wish you the best of luck 👍
depression,f8wlxbo,t3_e2gnrw,1574893874.0,This hit unbelievably close to home. I slept for nearly 13 hours last night/ today. I’ve been dealing with a lot and it’s so nice to leave the real world behind for a little while. Even though I end up feeling guilty about it.. especially when my boyfriend came back home for the second time and realized I was STILL asleep. The time change sure doesn’t help either. If you sleep too late- you may very literally never see the light of day 😂😭
Advice,f8ojwoc,t1_f8ogb5l,1574684214.0,"Thank you for responding. This was very helpful. I’m going to take your advice and keep away from this person. I’d considered him a good friend before. A lot of my friends recently moved away so we started hanging out more. But I never thought he would be capable of something like this. It’ll be hard to accept the reality of the situation but it would be much harder to see him again and have to act as if nothing ever happened. I’m trying to sympathize with my boyfriend.. and I do completely understand that it was and still is a lot for him to take in. I was just a little blind-sighted by his reaction, or lack of one.  He has never been one to show much emotion though.. it’ll be a long road for the both of us. I was really struggling to determine what my first step should be in processing and moving past this so I am very thankful that you took the time to help me. Thank you again <3"
