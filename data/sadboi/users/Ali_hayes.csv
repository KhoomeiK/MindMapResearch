OnePiece,fqgkn2y,t1_fqgk2qk,1589348833.0,"No not at all, that makes sense. I totally respect that Oda has respectable LGBT characters. My concern is that the lack of direct recognition of these things is discouraging. Admitably it's baby steps, and the fact they exist at all is definitely nice.

I guess maybe my grief is mainly with just how like you can certain that someone is LGBT but then all of a sudden aren't. I imagine it's all because of the publishers, but it's in general annoying as a viewer. For example, it wouldn't surprise me of Kiko just suddenly was male again because the war is over.

I hope that by then end of one piece society will be more accepting and so he can actually recognize people of the community in an open way (e.g. a celestial dragon being homophobic / transphobic then getting punched etc.). It would be an interesting addition to the whole over reaching ideology of freedom and those that try to repress it."

You, I, and everyone else who is trans does not a choice to transition. I have basically fucked myself in almost every way imaginable. Yet, it doesn't matter, because it's uncontrollable.

You were born into this life, and it's now your destiny to confront it and maybe fall to the oppression. It's much easier to accept fucked up circumstances that you find yourself in when you realize that you don't actually have a choice. There's only one direction forward, and that's transition.

Will you walk forward or sit where you stand / walk backwards and die knowing that you never even fucking tried. I wouldn't be able to rest in peace with that.

My advice, which is not to be confused with your understanding of your own situation and the best step forward, is to not wait and tell your parents asap. The longer you wait to start the process the more painful everything becomes.

Every moment of suffering you experience now is 10 less for the future.
