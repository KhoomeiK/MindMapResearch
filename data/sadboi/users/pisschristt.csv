If you can explain the situation to a friend or different family member, or at the least that it is not safe for you to continue to be there, I'm sure they would understand and let you stay with them. I am so sorry you're experiencing this. You have every right to feel angry, to feel sad, hurt, victimized, whatever you're feeling. You aren't alone and I hope this all gets resolved for you quickly. No matter what happens in the 3D world, we here all believe and support you. Best of luck"

As someone taken advantage of by an adult as a minor, come back to this when you are in your 20s and I guarantee you will think of it differently."
