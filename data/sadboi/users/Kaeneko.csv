BDSMAdvice,fhgv8h3,t3_f33ypa,1581580622.0,"Checking out your other posts, I'm really worried for you OP. Please don't buy into the false belief that ""spicing things up"" for your abuser will make things better. And I can tell you from experience that diving into BDSM/non-con won't make actual rape feel better, because he's violating your trust and love just as much as anything else. Abusive relationships are the most addictive drug, because your ""drug"" in these cases can actively manipulate you into staying.

Here's stuff I wish I knew when I was trying to leave:

*It takes an average of seven tries to leave an abusive relationship. Don't beat yourself up if you don't completely get away the first time, just get ready to try again ‚ù§Ô∏è

*Whatever he says he'll do, he probably won't. Abusers are all bark and basically only bite to keep their victims 'in check.' If he's threatening suicide, hand him a hotline number and walk away. You've done your part, his actions are his choice. It may seem cold, but just remember how little care he showed you every time he hurt you and then blamed you for it.

*Not only do you deserve better, you actually can do better. Being with an abuser can make it feel like you're only good for/at being abused, because it becomes something you're used to living with, but there are good people that will be drawn to you once you start recovering.

*His reasonings are garbage. The only appropriate response to causing serious harm to someone is to apologize, reflect, then figure out how to make amends/help who you've wronged. NOT to suddenly find reasons why that person deserved to be hurt. ***No one deserves to be abused.***

I know this is long and I'm sorry. Delete/hide this if it's crossing a line. But also feel free to dm me if you want to talk to someone who escaped their rapist. Best of luck üíï"

I find things that help me feel small and cared for are water checks, where CG asks if I've had water recently, gets me water if I haven't or encourages me to if they're not there, same with food, it's always nice to be handfed üòá your DD could take bubble baths with you or bring a chair in to be with you and watch your adorableness as you have one. I really really love sitting on a pillow on the floor next to my CGs, it makes me feel so tiny and owned. And that's something that can be done basically whenever you're hanging out! I've heard others say little candies like ringpops and Smarties can help them feel small, or foods like dino nuggies and tater tots, or kiddie cereal. Your DD can make those meals for you, and they're pretty easy.

You could find a covert way to reinforce the dynamic even when you're out in public, whether that's something sexual like a remote controlled toy or something innocent like carrying matching dolls/charms in your pockets or wearing matching jewelry. I've made simple necklaces/bracelets by just braiding some embroidery floss and tying the ends together. My Daddy almost never takes his off and it helps us feel connected despite the distance. Plus, making them really made me feel little! Lots of arts and crafts can do that for you, and you can buy little kits online with easy instructions on how to make all sorts of jewelry and even little plushies! I made a trans-colors ice cream cone with nonbinary sprinkles :3 lol I'm feeling smaller just thinking about it, I really recommend the plushies!

With that in mind: **stuffies!** Have tea parties and invite Daddy and your closest circle of stuffie guardians. Dress up for the special occasion!

Talk about what you miss, and see if you two can ease back into it. Tell him you're nervous about it, and (assuming he also wants to start this up again) ask him for praise whenever you're able to do little things. 

For rules and punishments I think it can be helpful to divide them into separate categories: Playtime and 24/7. For 24/7 rules, think about what you're trying to improve in yourself and your life and let that influence them. Accompanying punishments could be unpleasant things like extra chores or writing lines, things that you actually want to avoid but won't make you anxious or upset if you wind up having to do them. Playtime rules could be things like ways you must speak to your DD/about yourself, dress code (let Daddy dress you/pick out your clothes, wear only pre-approved outfits etc), performing certain servile tasks before/after playtime like massaging your DD, arranging/cleaning toys, undressing him or putting his clothes away. And finally, the Playtime punishments, or as some call them, funishments. These are the things littles might love to pretend we hate, like spankings and restraints. I'm sure your imagination can run wild in this area! Just make sure you stay safe üòá"

mentalillness,fg2w02u,t3_ewkr3h,1580458300.0,"BPD is a widely misunderstood diagnosis even among the general mental health community from what i know, but there are BPD-specific and PD-specific groups that you can join to at least know you're not alone in your experience.

As for your boyfriend, please kick that guy to the curb. You deserve SO much better than to constantly be belittled and told you deserve to hurt this way or that you do it to yourself. If you have a tendency to self sabotage that's something that can be approached in a much kinder, more considerate way.

As for therapy and psychiatry, I know there's lots of bullshit to deal with but PLEASE keep trying. You CAN find someone who is good at what they do and doing it for the right reasons (i.e. humanity > money). BPD is a demon you shouldn't try to battle on your own. Even the strongest people need help, and that's okay, that's part of being human. Choosing to continue therapy/searching for the right therapist is choosing yourself and your health. You're scared of hurting your family; good therapy + meds if you need them will greatly reduce your suicide risk.

You deserve to be happy and healthy and surrounded by people who understand and support you. It takes effort and practice, but learning how to put yourself first is so worth it. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Someone that threatens the safety of your children immediately exits their (and by extension your) life forever, it seems like a no-brainer... But then again, so do a lot of things that abuse makes seem confusing/debatable to the victim.

I read the comments about how she manipulates the system, and it makes me sick to my stomach. Do you think you could get pictures/videos for evidence? I mean, I don't know how the system works so I have no clue if that would even matter, but I feel like it's probably a good idea to document things as closely as possible without her catching on. Maybe if you show the caseworker a picture of drugs &/ a blacklisted person in her living room, they'll work harder to actually help her children."

I think after a while here we all take to heart how important communication is, but even once we know that, there are still so many things TO communicate about that the average vanilla person would never think of. So when you're newer to this little realm of existence it can be really hard to both A) anticipate the things you'll need to communicate about with each partner and B) perceive similar words/phrases and body language in the way that lots of kinky people might mean it vs how vanillas might mean it.

It just comes down to unabashedly asking individuals about their preferences and tendencies. You can't ever know what's going on in someone else's head. You might get good at guessing, but that's not the game you want to play when it comes to anticipating needs, wants, and intent of romantic or sexual partners.
