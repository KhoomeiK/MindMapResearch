Levi's go down to a size 23 now (styles are limited) and with a 28 inseam they're still long, but I like the way they look cuffed so I don't mind.

I get all my work pants from The Gap and Banana Republic because they go down to 00 and come in petite. You'll probably have to order online though. Both stores sell jeans too.

American Eagle goes down to 00 as well and they have an X-short inseam that's usually 26 or 27 inches.

Express has petite sizes too and they some some really good business casual peices and denim.

I've found the best thi g you can do is take measurements. You'll probably have to order everything online and you can save a lot of time and returns if you look at the size chart or product details to compare measurements.

Depending on the product you can also get ankle/crop pants, but depending on the wash sometimes that doesn't work for jeans."

This depends on where you are. In some countries tips aren't required, and even if you're in the U.S. there are some states where car wash employees get paid regular minimum wage, not tipped minimum wage. 

If you're in a country where tipping isn't the norm or a U.S. where car wash employees are paid the regular minimum wage, then you guys aren't the assholes, he is for making a racist comment.

But if you're in a place where you should tip and you didn't, everyone sucks. In the U.S. at least the federal tipped minimum wage is only $2.13/hour. Without tips, those workers are not making enough to live. They are performing a service for you that you are too lazy to do yourself. You can agree with tipping or not, and there is an argument to be made that employers should just pay their workers. But if you're in an area where they're not, for now it's unfortunately on normal people to take up the slack."

You have to live in the house and look at the decorations every day too. If something is truly that offensive to your eyes, you shouldn't have to put up with it. 

This is no different than when women won't let their husbands buy reclining chairs with cup holders because they think they're ugly and don't want it in their house.
