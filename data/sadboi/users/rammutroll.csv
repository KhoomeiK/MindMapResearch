My friends are having a blast just staying home and blazing all the time. Me I‚Äôm sober AF but I keep myself busy all the time and it helps get your mind off of weed. 

The hardest was the first 2-3 days. I suggest you buy some video games, start drawing, learn something new like do online courses, learn the guitar. Get yourself busy. 

Spend more time with your family and find your passion. After a while you won‚Äôt even think about weed anymore. 

But right now is the worst time to stop I agree. I wish I still used cannabis I would be blazed all the time that probably my tolerance would be at an all time high and I won‚Äôt get high anymore lol. 

If you put your mind Into it and keep yourself busy. You can do it. 

If I can do it, I am sure anybody could. I was vaping (not smoking) a good 3.5 per day if not more. Edibles and concentrates too. 

Good luck!"
Petioles,fo51ypf,t1_fo3lmj8,1587515779.0,"The mind is very powerful. If you tell yourself you don‚Äôt wanna smoke again or want to quit for good you will. It has to come from within. If you are not convinced at 100% you will eventually fall back. That‚Äôs number one. 

The first 2 weeks you have to be occupied all the time. I replaced it with online courses and starting my own business on the side to do a side hustle. I spent more time with family. Read more. Played more video games. I basically kept myself occupied so much that I don‚Äôt have time to think about weed.

Obviously it‚Äôs hard at first. The first 2-3 days I just felt like going outside and blazing. But I resisted and once you get over that it gets easier. You will always have urges to smoke but set goals like ok I want to test myself in 3 months and test negative for THC. This will motivate you. 

There‚Äôs an app called grounded. It really helps to give you that extra motivation the first couple of weeks. 

Once you go past week 2 you pretty much eliminate it from your routine and it gets easier by day. 

I went cold turkey. I had my friends smoke Infront if me and I just watched them and drank my beer. Having an occasional drink from time to time when the urge is really bad is a good substitute. Just don‚Äôt do it everyday though!

sqdc,fntbgsv,t1_fntawr3,1587238329.0,"Battery life is better on the Solo2. It can go up to 3 hours of nonstop vaping so you pretty much charge it once in a while. I‚Äôm a heavy user and didn‚Äôt charge it as often as say the mighty when I got it. 

The heat up time on the Solo2 is legendary. It‚Äôs so fast to heat up compared to the air2. 

Build is much more rigid on the Solo2. I had it for a couple of years and dropped it many times and it works like it‚Äôs brand new. It‚Äôs made out of aluminium on the outside I think and it‚Äôs definately more durable than the air. 

Only advantage of the air is really the fact that you can remove the batteries and swap them. But the Solo2 can go on for like 3 hours so I don‚Äôt see any problems with that. 

I don‚Äôt have an air but that‚Äôs based on the research I did and what people told me. Solo is like the big boss and air is the second best. They are both great but I would definately get another Solo2 if I got to choose again. 

Cheers!"
sqdc,fnsmimo,t1_fnskmyp,1587224647.0,"The solo is much better than the air. Price is lower on the air and it has removable batteries but if you use it a couple of times a week you will probably charge it once every 1-2 weeks.

sqdc,fni4tgd,t1_fni4k0y,1586973990.0,"You probably know about the sun Vaporents, but if you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a great community that taught me a lot about vapes and their pros and cons. 

I highly recommend you go there and ask any questions you have. They are very big on the dynavap, Solo2 and mighty. They even post which online retailers have sales and whatnot. 

Get the Dynavap! I never met anymore who had it that did not like it. Maybe later on you will upgrade to something fancier but for the time being it will be so much better than those cheap China vapes. 

Cheers!"
sqdc,fni46j7,t1_fni1phk,1586973675.0,"A lot of those cheap vapes are not built in a safe way. Like some vapes from China were opened up by many users and they noticed that some wires were burnt and those fumes were being inhaled by the users. So it‚Äôs a question of safety really. 

If you are medical, you should be somewhat worried about your health. And the Mighty (Storz and Bickel) is made in Germany and they have some medical vapes like the mighty medic and the volcano which are tested and approved for medical use. 

The Solo2 is made in Canada and considered a very top quality compared to other cheaper China made vapes that have 0 quality/Heath and safety standards. 

Cheap vapes will do the job for cheap, but in the expense of your health. 

Solo2 on 420 sales can be very cheap. If you are a total beginner you can even look Into the Arizer Air 2 which is even cheaper than the Solo2. Usually Arizer throws in a free Air2 if you buy any of their products. So you can get a desktop unit and the air for free (if they still have those sales). 

I really recommend you get something approved and at least built properly so you only Inhale the cannabis vapour and not any fumes/dangerous chemicals that can damage your lungs and health on the long term. 

If you want the cheapest vape that has a good reputation, look into the Dynavap. They are less than 100$ and powered by butane. Hits hard and is very cheap. 

That‚Äôs my 2cents."
sqdc,fnhwp21,t3_g1qmcz,1586970112.0,"It depends on what you want actually and what‚Äôs your budget. If you want something portable and that uses battery (not butane powered) I suggest the Mighty or Solo2. 

Mighty is the best of the best, Solo2 is the best price/quality you can get. Mighty is more powerful though. 

If you don‚Äôt know what to choose between crafty+ and the mighty. Go for the mighty. Crafty is a watered down version of the mighty. 

If you want the best of the best. Just get the mighty and never look back. If you get the solo2 you will get it for a very good price and you will use it daily for a full year and then will start fantasizing about the mighty and will end up getting the mighty afterward. So my advice to you is to get the mighty and have the king right from the start. 

The cons of the mighty is the higher price tag, and the fact that you have to clean it. 

Solo2 is less powerful than the mighty but you don‚Äôt have to think about cleaning it ever. So simple, portable and even heats up faster. 

If you have a higher tolerance the mighty is a better choice. If you are a noob then the Solo2 is the perfect vape to start with. 

I have both and use the mighty 99% of time, but when I use the solo I am still impressed."

My biggest factor was the fact that I didn‚Äôt even get high anymore. And if I do get high it won‚Äôt last for more than an hour or 2 tops. It was costing me a fortune too! Like a good 600-700 a month! 

The worst thing is when you have a kid (or more than one) and every time I use weed i would get a guilt trip. Like why am I putting my family through this. Why am I always seeing my kid high and barely have energy to play with him. I‚Äôd rather just go on Reddit and he‚Äôs around me playing calling me out and I‚Äôm like a vegetable around him. 

I didn‚Äôt wanna do any courses or improve on myself. I just wanted to vape, do edibles, and go online to buy weed (I‚Äôm in Canada). I spent so much time and money on weed. It had to stop. And I stopped. 

I‚Äôm not anti weed. But I really think it slows people down more than they think. 

It‚Äôs good to do once in a while, like having a drink every other weekend or so, but if it becomes a daily and hourly habit. It‚Äôs time to stop.

And that goes for Tangerine Dream, Delhaze, Purple Chitral, Pink Kush and GWS. 

Like I said I bought a shitload of SR and only had like 2-3 packages that had bigger sized nugs. And they were pink kush and delhaze.

Petioles,fmqbz21,t1_fmq91rv,1586296759.0,There are actually products that dilute your piss that actually work. You just need to drink so much water and use those products and should be Ok. I dehydrated myself and wanted to see if it‚Äôs still in my system or not and guess it still was.
Petioles,fmqbtdx,t1_fmq8b3g,1586296675.0,It‚Äôs a bit contributor for sure! Plus my wife keeps cooking sweets and baking. Ffffff
Petioles,fmqbqt0,t1_fmq6pro,1586296636.0,I stopped for almost 2 years before starting again and on the first times I was REALLY high. If you stop for a year or so and smoke you will get blitz like the good old days. But 2-3 times after and it‚Äôs like riding a bike.
Petioles,fmq63wo,t1_fmq5tvn,1586293564.0,Thank you! I will it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs hard these days because of the quarantine. But I will for sure! Cheers!
Petioles,fmq61f2,t1_fmq5y1k,1586293526.0,Yeah I‚Äôm not obese more like overweight. I think I need to be 180 to be considered normal.
Petioles,fmq5ydq,t1_fmq5myw,1586293480.0,That sound a lot like me actually. Didn‚Äôt get high anymore like I just feel more relaxed. I think the more concentrates and edibles you do the longer it takes your body to flush it out. I dunno but I‚Äôm gonna try again every 2 weeks and see when it gets flushed completely.
Petioles,fmq5mo1,t1_fmq5bf6,1586293307.0,"I think it depends on the test you use like I can probably buy a cheaper one that will show I‚Äôm negative. 

I also abused edibles and really went all out before quitting. Like yolo style. 

I think if I was a bit more active and drank cranberry juice and a lot of water I would flush it much faster. But I‚Äôm not doing any of that so I should start burning some fat."
Petioles,fmq530l,t1_fmq50os,1586293019.0,Yep! A bit overweight. Corona isolation and lockdown is not helping lol
Petioles,fmq4wpp,t1_fmq4ftl,1586292927.0,I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs working. If I tested negative I would question it but I clearly tested positive. I‚Äôm gonna try it again in 2 weeks and see.
Petioles,fmq4m99,t1_fmq4d55,1586292777.0,Welcome! This brand is very good I find and it has great reviews too!
Petioles,fmq4kin,t1_fmq3kp6,1586292752.0,He must be really skinny cuz it stores in the fat.
Petioles,fmq4gzx,t1_fmq1dqq,1586292701.0,Looks like it‚Äôs gonna take me a while lol
Petioles,fmq3xhc,t1_fmq3oy5,1586292419.0,Got those from amazon Canada. 5 tests for 30-35$ Canadian. And they are very accurate too!
Petioles,fmq3vu2,t1_fmpztx7,1586292395.0,I actually got them from amazon! Bought 5 tests like those for like 30-35$ Canadian.
Petioles,fmq3t0p,t1_fmpzdbb,1586292354.0,Yeah! I‚Äôm gonna try again in 2 weeks and once again in a month. I bought 5 tests in total so every 2 weeks I‚Äôll do a test to see.
Petioles,fmq3op4,t1_fmpynox,1586292292.0,Lol I‚Äôm a bit overweight. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11 and weight about 205-210 probably now that I am always at home eating all the time lol
Petioles,fmq3jdd,t1_fmpy4xh,1586292218.0,Nice! I‚Äôm gonna do that and drink loads of cranberry juice to detox. I‚Äôll drink lots of water too.
Petioles,fmq3gly,t1_fmpyrgf,1586292178.0,"I didn‚Äôt dab but I added some shatter to my vape sessions sometimes. 

I also did edibles daily!"
Petioles,fmq3ekb,t1_fmpzbvd,1586292148.0,I wanted it to be concentrates to have more accurate results. I didn‚Äôt wanna fake it out I wanted to make sure it was completely out of my system.
Petioles,fmq32cl,t1_fmpz155,1586291975.0,Yes exactly!
Petioles,fmpwph8,t1_fmpw437,1586288720.0,"I had a high tolerance to edibles. Probably around 50-100mg a day. Plus I vaped ALOT during the last couple of days. 

I‚Äôm sure it all added up but I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really up to 6 months. That‚Äôs crazy lol"
