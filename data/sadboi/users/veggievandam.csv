CatAdvice,fqmpm9x,t3_gjr1yt,1589481397.0,"I've had luck using positive punishment to show it is not desirable behavior. Positive punishment (not necessarily a mean thing, its a psych term) works by *presenting* an aversive consequence after an undesired behavior is exhibited, making the behavior less likely to happen in the future. The following are some examples of positive punishment:

* A child touches a hot stove (behavior) and feels pain (aversive stimulus).
* A person eats spoiled food (behavior) and gets a bad taste in his/her mouth (aversive stimulus).
* Kitten bites and scratches (behavior) and you walk away from her so you are no longer playing (aversive stimulus).

When kitty bites/scratches I would say ""ouch"" in a high pitch,  exaggerated way, and pull back from her reach. Really play it up, they read body language.  I would then proceed to walk away from her and out of the room if needed. When you walk away its great to make sure you can kick a toy in her direction to redirect her as you go BUT, make sure it doesn't come off as a reward to her attacks or as a continuation of the game/playtime. It's better to walk away with no perceived reward/redirection than it is to make her think that you are still playing.

&#x200B;

The goal in all that is not to scare or punish the kitten, but to show them that the biting behavior does not produce their desired results, which is play. Over time the kitten will associate the biting/attacking behaviors as something that makes you leave and stop playing, therefore they will be less likely to do it.

&#x200B;

When training puppies we make it a game. We try to reward heavily for nice play and once behavior gets out of control play stops in this manner. They quickly learn the right way to behave.

&#x200B;

The last thing I want to add is that the high pitch ""ouch"" is actually a very important step so don't skip it. It ""marks"" the behavior and it tells the cat exactly which thing they are doing that is wrong, the same way a click would mark the correct behavior in a clicker training session. If you have the cat bitting or attacking you and then you just get up without marking they will not make the connection that you want them to make."

The research step is so important because if you just work off of things like tiktok or IG you may not find reliable, accurate information and that's a potential mess. I also feel that research is important because it gives you background knowledge on why your doing what your doing during spell work. If you don't know why your doing something, then why are you doing it? Ya know? 

Next I would say keep your practice quiet and possibly find a way to hide any of your supplies. Parents don't always react well and I think it's best to do some research to find what calls you so that you can intelligently explain yourself if you are confronted by them. It also gives you the chance to explore without outside pressure to stop. 

Having a historical knowledge to back yourself up with is valuable since people sometimes judge us harshly, as if we are children playing make believe (how it feels to me).

Guns aren't evil or anything. I think they are pretty important for hunting actually. And yes, I'm okay with responsible, conservation minded, eithical hunting practices. Be thankful for what you have and respect the animal sustaining your life. In my area hunting is actually quite important to keep the eco system balanced because of invasive deer and other animal. We also have a gun that shoots non lethal bean bags or rubber bullets for self/home defense purposes. We've almost had to use it and we live in the burbs (low crime area) and I'm greatful that we have it. It's kinda fucked what people will do to when they are in a tight situation. In our case it was a guy breaking into houses for drugs.

Anyways, I garden, have guns, store food and have medical supplies and emergency bags in case my husband and I have to evacuate anywhere. It's just good practice. I don't have the ability to can my own food, I freeze what I can and that's what I've got for now. 

I agree that bunkers are a bit much, but honestly, there is nothing wrong with making sure you can sustain and protect yourself however you can  because you can't always count on others in today's day and age no matter how much you try to create a supportive community.

Virginia,fpwfcho,t1_fpwc540,1588962460.0,"I'll start with saying I don't agree with the bill at all, but It's called lifestyle cut backs. If you're making a six figure salary you are already making way more then the average American. Median personal income is around 30-40k per a basic Google search. I make around that amount and even I was able to figure out some budget cutbacks/less expensive alternatives to manage bills until this gets a bit better. At six figures you're already way better off than most in this country and you should be able to figure something out, just like the poor have to figure it out when their already small checks get cut further. 

That said, if you lost your job and have no income I think that you should be eligible for whatever assistance there is regardless of income prior to the crisis."

You keep pushing your warning of things I've already explored and worked through with my own medical team. Like I said, it's taken me a significant amount of time to get over my fear and hatred that I held for talking these meds and to come to terms with the treatment that works and that I need for my disabilities. 

The video you sent was just a video vilifying the use of benzos. How those specific people had bad treatment experiences. It's makes it seem as if these meds have no viable use in a montiored treatment plan and it makes it seem like everyone who takes them is going to get worse. There is seriously already enough shame around taking benzo medications, Its enough."
Fibromyalgia,fpvy5rd,t1_fpvvd0l,1588953933.0,"It's really disgusting the way you're med shaming you know that right? We all know there is an opiate crisis and that benzos can be addictive, but you have no right to start making judgements on someone else's treatment plan. It's not right to be sending video's to make someone question themselves and make them feel like they are an addict when they are responsibly taking care of themselves. There is already so much shame attached to needing mental health treatment, why perpetuate that further? 

I've been diagnosed with OCD and bipolar disorder for a while now and after 10 years of treatment my doctor and I have figured out that I can't be on typical ssri OCD treatments because of manic episodes that occur when on that treatment regiment. Fast acting benzos stop panic attacks when I feel like I need to scrub my skin off from contamination without causing manic episodes. OCD has also given me ruminating thoughts surrounding the fear of being an addict and it's taken ages of therapy to tackle that obsession and learn not to hate myself for needing the treatment I need. 

There is enough shame dolled out when I have to pick up my meds every month from the pharmacist, there is no reason for strangers on the internet to butt with their opinion too. There are more respectful ways of saying hey, look into xzy disorder aside from sending video's to make someone feel bad about the treatment they need."

COVID19,fpt71r3,t1_fpt5cz0,1588885992.0,"That's discrimination. It's the same as requiring an HIV test before admission. 

But either way, you're back at the begining of the argument, the nursing homes can deny covid patients based on their inability to care for them. If the nursing home does not have the ability to care for a patient, whatever the reason, they can tell NYS and have them relocated. They don't have to take them, but their refusal cant be based on discrimination. That opens up a whole other issue. 

The hospitals are also not a stand in for long term medical care facilities, that would lead to flooding of our healthcare system putting us back to square one. Long term care patients also can't just ""go stay with a relative"" either. They are in those facilities with medical equipment and trained medical staff for a reason, they don't have access to those things at home. Those refused patients could die because they do not have the care they needed in those facilities, what makes them less important in regards to life sustaining medical care? Their covid dx?"

There is also a major difference between living at work where you make masks, and living at work where you are surrounded by death and disease all day, risking your life for a very small paycheck. I don't think it's really a comparable situation."
COVID19,fpt3twc,t1_fpt22ng,1588884387.0,"It's not just major interventions into a private business that we are discussing though. You are talking about restructuring the long term living situation of the elderly and the ill. It's a problem way beyond the government setting out new regulations. 

Say the state does form all covid/ non covid facilities and then patients sent to the hospital are not allowed back to their old home, then what? Where do they go next? What happens when others in the home get sick and sent out? Does that home let new patients in at all in the meantime? What about our inability to test everyone in the homes daily to prevent spread? What about asymptomatic spread, how can you certifiably say that you are working with non covid patients on any situation? 

How does keeping nursing homes as non covid or covid only work in the situation that we are in? 

Seriously, I'd love to hear some productive, realistic brainstorming."
COVID19,fpt2cop,t1_fpsv4qp,1588883652.0,"The mandate said that the nursing homes had to meet certain requirements to care for all patients regardless of covid status.  BUT the mandate also said that if the facility could not meet the segregation/care requirements for covid/non-covid patients then they could refuse those returning patients based on the fact that they could not provide adequate care. The state would then relocate those patients to places where they can get adequate care. 

What is so confusing about that? 

Either you can modify your facility to meet the new standards and you are not allowed to discriminate against covid status, OR, you cannot modify your facility and you cannot meet the standards meaning you are no longer able to care for that patient and the state would relocate them. 

The nursing homes are not being forced to take patients that they cannot provide adequate care for, all they have to do is raise their hand and say I provide care to meet requirements and those patients would be moved."
COVID19,fpt0b4j,t1_fpsxieq,1588882653.0,"Stimulus bills don't provide unending amounts of funding to prop up every industry effected by this virus, that falls back into the realm of being unrealistic. And it's certainly not a small fraction of the patients being impacted by this, we wouldn't be having this conversation of it was only a small fraction of residents being effected. 


The state put out the mandate saying that homes have to take covid positive patients back in if they can abide by the regulations because if they had not done so, where would all the returning positive patients go? They get kicked from the nursing home to the hospital and then to where? They still need care despite being positive and they can't stay in the hospitals indefinitely. Nursing homes are some of the only places they can get long term care. 


If the state had not made the order *based on the nursing homes affirmation that they can provide care* then none of the nursing homes in the state would have allowed covid 19 positive patients to preserve their reputations and those patients would have no where to go causing yet another issue. This is not about what they should have done from the begining, it's about what needs to be done now. If a nursing home can't care for it's patients then it needs to say so and lose that revenue so the patient can be transferred to sutable care. 


 IMO, a non return order would not have made a difference in the begining either because we still did not have enough tests to know who was positive and who was not. We still don't have enough tests to determine this so I still don't see the difference. Asymptomatic spread makes this a complicated beast and it's impossible to keep it out of the nursing homes no matter what we do."
COVID19,fpsrww7,t1_fpspum8,1588878584.0,"My opinion is that moving the elderly from long term living situations is much different then telling someone to temporarily buy their unessential flowers from a different retailer. But either way, the state has inspections going on to make sure nursing homes are doing the right thing. I'm sure that plenty of them are not, I mean it's absurd what care issues go on in nursing homes on a good day, but the state has said they will revoke permiting and things as they see fit. 

Call me cold, but I don't think this is a ""divert all resources here"" situation. It absolutely needs to be addressed with force, but this is just one aspect of the majorly fucked situation that we will be in for a while, and somehow things need to be done equitably. I would not agree to the idea that we should stop funding school lunch pickups for underserved students just to put more money into splitting up nursing homes. We need to strike a balance where every area in need gets some assistance, unfortunately there will never be enough to go around."
COVID19,fpsozxp,t1_fpskws4,1588877170.0,"Nursing homes are for profit businesses. The state is removing patients as they are asked but the state cannot just come in and start moving long term patients around without the homes having a say in it. Not only would that be a huge loss of income for the nursing home causing the eventual collapse of their business, it would be a major disruption to the lives of the patients in those homes and that is not always in their best interests. Even in this covid situation. 

The reality is that there is almost nothing we can do to keep nursing homes sterile from this virus even if we have positive/negative only facilities. This virus spreads with asymptomatic carriers and because of that we will never 100% be able to identify who does and does not have a case until we have better testing. We can't just put all positive/suspected positive patients in the hospitals until then and these patients still need consistency of care in their lives. We also can't create the necessary number long term care centers that it would take to attempt to split up positive and negative cases. That would be an unrealistic undertaking. 

The state has set out guidelines saying that covid positive patients have to be in sperate cohorts/spaces and they need to have a completely separate staff among other things. This would be similar to the patients being in a hospital but not in a covid ward. If the nursing home  is keeping patients and can't handle that set up then shame on the nursing home for not speaking up and doing the right thing by their patients. 

As much as the state has taken over many things, they still do not have the right to just come in and take revenue from one business and give it to another business (in this case it would be them arbitrarily removing patients from one home to put them in another home). That state has said over and over that if a nursing home can't properly care for their patients they only have to say so and the state would step in to take that patient of their hands.

You're asking that state to do more, but on a practical level, what more are they able to do?"
COVID19,fpsj2qz,t1_fpsdv20,1588874314.0,"All the nursing homes had to do was say ""I don't have the resources to care for this patient"" and they wouldn't have to take that covid patient back.  It's that simple. NYS would then step in and transfer that patient to another facility that can meet regulations regarding covid care or they would go to a covid only facility.

Nursing homes are private, for profit institutions, the state doesn't run them and they can't come in and make those decisions for them, the state is only a regulator in this situation. The nursing home has to say they can't offer the correct standard of care set forth by the state before the state is able to step in to move people. That means the nursing home would lose the income for that patient by transferring them and my guess is that is part of the problem. They don't want to lose money. 

It all comes down to the fact that you can't just empty nursing homes into the hospital system until this is over. You still need them to take the elderly in for long term care and they can't be allowed to discriminate based on medical condition unless they are saying they don't have the resources to care for the patient and they try to get them placed elsewhere. It sucks, and if someone has a better, more viable option, I'd love to hear it, but right now the ball is in the nursing homes court. If they aren't owning up to their inability to care for their patients/customers then we need to address that, but the state can't just wave it's hand to and take over."
