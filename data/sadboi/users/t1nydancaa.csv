ANTM,fpho6lp,t1_fo8x65e,1588624745.0,Sara's makeover made her look so creepy! The bleached eyebrows works sometimes (rarely imo) but hers just looked kind of alien to me.
AskWomen,fp8d8um,t3_gbnitf,1588389403.0,"I'm an editor at a magazine. I need to have a Bachelor's in English, creative writing, or journalism, and I got a copy editing certificate, though that wasn't a necessity. I needed experience working in magazines to understand the production and how to work with departments like design. It helps to also understand journalism ethics when editing reporters, so experience in journalism is also very helpful."

woodworking,foob1gi,t1_fonvd3x,1587935829.0,Oh geez yeah replacing it seems definitely out of my skill set right now. I’ve actually since cleaned out in between all the cracks so I got rid of all the crumbs and dust. I’ll try buying a light walnut stain to start with and then see how that goes. Thank you for the advice!
ANTM,fodtrvk,t3_g6uv3i,1587689976.0,"If you could do anything differently, would you? And if so, what would you do differently?

Also, is makeover really that stressful or is it more of an act? At this point people should know it’s coming I imagine. 

I’m literally watching ANTM in quarantine right now (not your cycle but I was a fan of yours!) so this is kinda funny and surreal. haha"

ANTM,fo9etaq,t3_g1vba9,1587617558.0,"C3: After Cassie has her conversation about having an eating disorder and gets eliminated, Tyra has a whole scene where she cries to her mom about how Cassie’s eating disorder affected her and her mom hugs her, telling her she did the best she could. How does this one not get talked about more!? That is some crazy narcissism there. 

C4: Michelle getting burns from the bleach they put in her hair. Everyone bullied her in the house about her having some contagious skin disease, too, while she panicked and cried about not understanding what was going on with her skin. 

C10: Making fun of Anya’s accent was super ignorant. It’s a native Hawaiian accent. 

C13: Casting and then uncasting Amber because she was an undercover actress (supposedly).

Every time Mr. Jay says he has to be mean to a girl to get a good photo from her."
ANTM,fo97g15,t3_g61g0g,1587612306.0,I didn’t even recognize her at first not as a blonde! Her natural hair looks so much better. It drives me crazy the unnecessary makeovers Tyra gives some of the girls (especially the bleached eyebrows—just why!).

weddingplanning,fn1kuzr,t3_fy4vlt,1586564170.0,"When we first got engaged, we were hoping to get married in October 2020. Then obviously everything happened, and I kept holding out hope that it might still happen and we could make it work. Today we accepted that it's just not going to happen and decided to push to early May 2021. We have nothing booked or confirmed except this tentative date, but it actually feels like a massive relief to just decide and not have to keep holding onto hope that somehow October 2020 will work. PHEW. So now I guess this is actually real."

Anxiety,fn0kcc1,t3_fnz5n3,1586543524.0,"So this isn't necessarily giving me too much anxiety (for now lol) but what happens after we peak and everything goes down to manageable levels? I just keep thinking about how things are going to gradually open again and we'll go back to our offices and what not, but won't the virus still be around and won't we just be risking having another massive spike like what we're dealing with currently? I'm excited at seeing that it looks like things are leveling out, but I just can't help thinking about how we could end up in this exact same place again so easily."

Anxiety,fmtpvb2,t1_fmtibct,1586376940.0,"I understand those spiraling thoughts all too well. Maybe thinking of it like this will help: Someone would have had to have sneezed/coughed/spit on the ground in the exact spot that your mom and/or brother stepped (likely only one of them would step in it with one foot unless they were walking step-by-step behind each other). Let's say the latter is true, and they both stepped it in with one foot. Even then, each time they continued to step, the amount of virus on their shoe would decrease more and more. Think of all the steps they took from the store, to the parking lot, walking up to your house, and then walking in the house with their shoes on. The likelihood that the virus remained on the bottom of their shoes from that point is so beyond minuscule already, and then considering that you probably dropped and picked up your thermometer within a couple of seconds, decreases it further. Experts say you would need at least 10 minutes of being within the proximity of an infected person to risk exposure regardless, so those few seconds of touching the ground where the possible virus exposure has been so diluted already just makes it even lower of a chance."

Like how can I share this information with my anxious family members and provide sources for them to read themselves? Even when people dive into the stats, I'm not a numbers person so it all kinda goes over my head. 

I've been looking at Worldometers, and while everyone keeps citing it as something that makes them feel optimistic, it seems daunting and negative to me (but, again, likely because I'm misinterpreting the numbers in some way)."

I already haven’t left my house in almost two weeks and am seeing things about how this is going to last six to nine months, and I just feel so desolate and anxious today.

I read one source that says with most Coronaviruses it's not a higher risk, but then they add a line that's like BUT THIS ONE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT! And then I read a totally different source that says asthmatics are at high risk. 

I've already deleted the Twitter app off my phone (as of an hour ago lol) and had myself a few good cry sessions to my fiancee and my mom so I'm in a better place than I was a few hours ago. And I work in the media industry, so I really struggle with the whole ""the media is the problem"" take, but damn. It truly is a lot, and it's just so damn hard to find answers (though I do strongly agree with the one comment that says once you get one answer you'll just want another one anyway).

Anyway, guess this is a little bit of a vent. I'm mentally exhausted right now, and I'm just sick of spiraling out. This thread brought me some of the first genuine comfort that I've felt all week, so thank you for that."
