toptalent,fr3uj2u,t3_gma7ia,1589866652.0,I’m in Georgia and it seems like most of the people here think they pandemic is over. I guess people are thinking the government said we could reopen so everything must be fine.
science,fr08c4t,t1_fr01u6f,1589786883.0,That’s a dramatic simplification. I’m an environmental scientist by profession. I wasn’t sure what to expect from a psychedelic experience. I tried some psilocybin mushrooms and had a completely unexpected experience. I had envisioned that I would have visual distortions or hallucinations. It seemed to take me to a completely different reality where time and space worked differently. It’s completely impossible to describe to someone who hasn’t seen it themselves. I met a being that looked like an actor that often plays scientists in movies. I said out loud to myself: “ oh I get it you must be a manifestation of my consciousness that my brain decided to place here since I associate this look with someone who is wise. The entity smiled and said “you’ve almost got it” Then they said: “actually I represent something your mind can’t quite comprehend therefore you are filling in the blanks with ideas from your sub conscious to create this image you are comfortable with.” They told me my friend I hadn’t talked with in years was having a similar experience and would call me tomorrow to explain more. After the experience I thought it was very interesting how my mind created that conversation for me. Then later the next evening my friend called from the country he was living in around the world. He said he had done DMT and named the actor I had seen in the vision and said he had a message for me. I was completely shocked. I know from a scientific perspective it’s possible that this was a complete coincidence coupled with a drug induced vision. However the incredible unlikely situation of me sharing a vision with a friend around the world who called me after several years of not speaking when the vision said they would call.... I’ll just say it opened my eyes to the possibility of something like what John Wheeler might embrace. A universe where perhaps consciousness forms more of a basis for reality then materialism. I’m not going to get into the science of that because physics is definitely not my field of study.

PublicFreakout,fqncudm,t1_fqncabx,1589492592.0,I think the point of the fetus being it’s own organism isn’t only relevant but the only real issue to consider here. I think someone should be able to do absolutely anything they want with their own bodies. That’s why I think the government should stay out of telling grown adults if they want to use substances to alter their own consciousness for example. The part that I have a problem with is that technically speaking the fetus has its own organs and unique DNA and is therefore residing in the mother but is it’s own organism. Ultimately it’s a person deciding the fate of another human’s body more so then deciding the fate of their own.
PublicFreakout,fqncc5o,t1_fqnbjtd,1589492343.0,Thanks for your reply.

PublicFreakout,fqn8pfy,t1_fqmfvmj,1589490561.0,"I’m going to get downvoted into oblivion, but I can’t stop myself. 

I consider
Myself pro-life and I don’t understand why more people aren’t also. I don’t have this belief due to religious reasons. I have just seen the statistics of what stage the fetus is usually at when the abortions are done and what it’s state of development is at that point. When you have a fetus with a brain and a heart and a unique human genetic code I don’t see why people don’t consider that fetus to be a human? Maybe it can’t survive on its own but there are many people hooked up to medical machines that couldn’t survive on their own either and they are still people. The most common argument is that a female should have the right to do what they want with their body but the fetus is genetically unique and therefore not a part of that woman’s body but has its own body. What about the millions of female fetuses that are killed? Why don’t those have the same rights as the other females? I think that people get locked into the idea it’s a woman’s right issue and don’t think about the actual details of the young human being killed they just lash out if someone even says they may be pro-life because they think that statement is anti feminist. I understand why some people are pro abortion rights and I don’t hate those people it’s a complicated issue. I just wanted to share my views and hear some feedback. I just request any feedback be respectful and articulate your views. Yelling at me doesn’t help either one of us.

I’ve seen religious people do the opposite with trying to say violent crime and violent totalitarian governments arise because of a lack of religion.

AskReddit,fpyrxn8,t3_gfsi0q,1589008419.0,When I was a teenager before cell phones existed I was outside in my backyard on a wireless phone connected to a landline. I was talking to a friend of mine in another town who was also outside on the same type of phone. We both had woods in our backyard with no houses where no one lived. Suddenly I heard a loud flute in the woods that played a musical tune. It caught me by surprise because no one should be back there. After a minute my friend said: “ what is that weird flute music?”  I told him I was curious about the same thing but I was surprised he could hear it over the phone. He asked me what I was talking about and could I hear it over the phone. After a minute of talking we realized we were both hearing flute music in the woods behind our houses. I muted the phone and then asked him to hum the tune he heard and he did the same with me. We realized we were both hearing the same tune at the same time. The sound was moving every time it played and getting further away from our houses. At a certain point when it was far away it stopped. I’m an environmental scientist and my friend now works for intelligence at the pentagon. We both still talk about this occurrence and have no scientific explanation for how it happened. I know this sounds made up but I promise you it’s a completely true story.

You are exploring this vast world instead of just rushing through it. It’s easy to level completely solo in retail. In Classic as you level there are constantly situations where you need to group up because enemies are too difficult to fight on your own. In addition to this if you die there is a huge run many times across an entire zone to get back to your body. This makes the world feel like a more dangerous place. You actually need to take the time to drink and rest between attacking enemies. Also professions seem to be more meaningful and you have people in cities yelling out about what they are selling just like in a real city. Classic definitely is a completely different feeling game for me. Having said that I do love retail also for collecting transmog, mounts, pets, and faster gameplay with dungeons and raids.

wownoob,fnbrq8y,t1_fnataqz,1586821005.0,I’m not sure if I’m following your question properly. Once you have the artifact weapons and have unlocked some appearances you need to transmog your current weapon to the legion artifact weapon appearance to use the new forms. If you don’t have your artifact weapon equipped you always need to transmog your current weapon. Hope that helps.
DungeonsAndDragons,fn7i383,t3_fzqdxq,1586720769.0,That appears to be a sculpture not a painting. However if it’s a painting of a sculpture it’s brilliant.
wow,fn1eoot,t3_fy2114,1586560449.0,All that sounds good. Although I can take it or leave it with the emissary chests.
wow,fmvat96,t1_fmuip4k,1586410889.0,"I think a good compromise would be that the rep is still required for the heritage armor since the rep is required for old race heritage armor.

Wow a lot of downvotes. I’ve unlocked all the allied races so forgive me if I’d like to see some type of benefit for putting in all that extra time. I don’t think that what I mentioned is an unreasonable compromise."
wow,fmvaj1k,t1_fmux091,1586410648.0,"I have all the allied races unlocked so I guess the jokes on me. I’m happy for the people who are getting to play them that don’t have as much time as I do though. 

The main thing I’m curious about is the heritage armor. Old races require exalted with the relevant factions. Will the new allied races require that also?"
wow,fmfae60,t1_fm3z1q9,1586023138.0,I appreciate this as someone who is working on their 7th max level Druid to have one of each race. If you have time to answer I’d be curious to know how or if you think this is connected to your autism? Thanks and good luck with the fundraising.
wow,fm70awr,t1_fm6actt,1585808767.0,I keep seeing people say this but they have said it will be 60 to 70 percent faster and right now it’s 100 percent xp so I think it should be a little faster now. Unless I’m missing something really obvious I’ll feel stupid about later.
CompetitiveWoW,flez55v,t1_fl20hok,1585094504.0,Maybe I’m missing something but I don’t see how a 100 percent xp boost is supposed to be the same speed as the 60 to 70 percent faster leveling in Shadowlands. It seems to me you would be comparing 100 percent faster with between 60 and 70 percent faster which makes now a decent amount more quick with the leveling.
woweconomy,fkeydbx,t1_fkel3tx,1584123267.0,"Thanks, I’ll check into it"
woweconomy,fkee3nn,t3_fhwusi,1584111257.0,I have the rematch addon but how do you use the script with it to make it easier?
wow,fjwb5n5,t1_fjv3iu6,1583637358.0,I’m biased in my love of MoP because that’s the xpac when I started playing.
classicwow,fiz9yxo,t1_fiz22ua,1582857638.0,I didn’t know Old school RuneScape has a similar system. I’m curious now and will look into that. Thanks for the information.
classicwow,fiz4q6w,t1_fiwhvyp,1582854097.0,I’m a man and I do these things every day. My wife works longer hours then I do and actually I don’t mind the housework. Also she never gives me a hard time about having a raid night. She’s a wow player also so that probably helps.
classicwow,fiyz93w,t1_fiyo6sj,1582850401.0,Buying gold in classic with real money is against the TOS. Im not talking about retail. I’m really surprised by the number of people who don’t seem to have a problem with the idea of the wow token in classic. It completely undermines a lot of the classic experiences like saving up gold for your first mount or your epic mount. Not to mention there is a lot of decently good gear on the AH people could just buy with real money.
classicwow,fiyna5t,t1_fix5r8u,1582842784.0,"Buying gold with real money is against the TOS and cheating. You can’t always keep everyone cheating. However that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea to officially condone it. The great thing about classic is that it is in now way pay to win unless someone cheats. That will completely change if Blizzard endorses a classic wow token. I’m enjoying classic now but I would lose interest if they make that change.

Wow, I thought the classic wow subreddit was primarily a “No changes community”."
TheBullWins,fiqomn1,t3_f94te0,1582648735.0,I totally agree that bullfighting is cruel and should stop. I’m still surprised by the number of people in these threads that make comments about how they hope the person died. Are these threads filled with militant vegans? Because factory farming isn’t exactly kind and peaceful to cows. So should everyone that works at a place that sells meat also be killed? I don’t understand people.
MurderedByWords,fiipum2,t1_fi23avq,1582424514.0,I actually didn’t agree with anything. I was simply pointing out why each group takes the positions that they do take. I never picked a side. However I don’t find your last statement to be factually accurate. Most abortions are performed around the 8 week mark and brain activity starts around week 6.
