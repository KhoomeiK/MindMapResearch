1. Welcome to the community. No one really asked to be here but we’re not so bad 😉

2. It’s tough because it’s all so sudden, but I am glad you have a diagnosis. That it already a big step toward stability. Good job! And I’m glad you’re taking your meds. It takes a lot of courage and hard work, we understand that better than anyone.

3. I’m sorry about your dream. It’s awful you have to deal with that. Life isn’t fair. I hope you manage to reach out for support from loved ones. You deserve support and love through this long journey! 

Not sure if this is something you’ll be interested in, but Ian Gallagher from Shameless has a similar story to yours. He also aspired to be in the military but couldn’t due to Bipolar Disorder. He went manic. Maybe you’d like to check that show out? Totally up to you. 

Regardless, feel free to message me if you need any support from someone who understands, or if you just need someone to listen.

First of all, feels good to have a question not aimed at graphemes or chromesthetes.

Alright, down to business.

Yes, it definitely strengthens the more I focus on the colour. I can pinpoint it. It’s like, okay they’re a cool colour...intense, assertive...light. Usually how the process goes. 

It’s not an automatic info dump.

It’s like my mind just builds the profile, and I don’t really get a say.

It analyzes and generates. Like a computer. And sometimes the computer glitches a bit. 

I find that relaxing and not trying to fight it helps strengthen the profile. Also focusing on just one person. Though I figure that last point is evident."

Aphantasia,flqmvo0,t3_fqd3af,1585400476.0,"**I'll definitely go add my experiences on your first post**

* The coping skills some of you have seem like superpowers to me. **They are superpowers. We're fucking legends.** 
* Directions/navigating: **have an awful sense of direction. It's always been so bad. I used to even get made fun of because I didn't know what was right or left. It was embarrassing. We even had this one field trip which was where we had to follow a map and find the ""treasure"". Oh God. Traumatic.**
* A few seemed ok or good at sport, but a most were bad at it. (But obviously in sport, muscle memory and reflexes do most of the work, but when I play pool table I just see [that](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uHLnFWvPlfo/maxresdefault.jpg)). **The doctors think I may have Asperger's, so perhaps that plays into my athletic handicap. All the same, I could definitely be worse at sports?**
* Jobs: many of you are programmers, works with numbers (sales, etc.) or work in art. **I am both and artist and very much into maths and sciences. I find the culinary arts to be a good balance between the two. Where you have to have creativity but also excellent execution.** 
* Math: many of you like math, but most of you hated geometry **Never realized that this is why I hated geometry. It makes so much sense. I have memories engraved forever in my head of the one lesson about transformations. Like transitions, reflections, rotations, and finally, tessellations. Rotations, oh God! I would actually cry. There was no possible way for me to know how to rotate it.** 
* I really liked the analogy of our perception as a program, using back-end and front-end. What non-aphants do mostly via visualization, you do using the concepts, like an algorithm. **I love this!**   

   * Like the Rubik's Cube example **I actually can't even solve one face of a rubik's cube. I have tried over and over. I don't get it. Never realized it was connected to my aphantasia.** 
   * The spelling thing still blows my mind: I suppose our brains may do that, and practice does most of the work, but when I want to spell a word, the word is associated with an [image](http://mrclown.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MC_WOD-House.jpg) of it, that i ""see"" and just... read out... **I'm actually very good at spelling. Don't wanna brag, but I've won a few spelling bees in my time. It's so interesting that you actually see the word spelled out and instinctively associate it with an image.** 
   * I assume you do the same with anagrams? So you did not relate at all with this [scene](https://youtu.be/B6NxD7RQPF0?t=138) in Harry Potter? **I always thought only genius' could do that. I couldn't understand this. My brain can't do that.** 
* Please do no mention disgusting things like vomit at the dinner table with your family omg NOOOOO that's just cruel haha **My dad is such a guy, he always does this! My whole family gets grossed out and I'm just calmly munching on my pizza. I thought they were being dramatic.**   
Because if I eat cheese pizza and you talk to me about vomit, every time i'll think of cheese pizza, i will LITERALLY TASTE AND SMELL VOMIT! Just writing this I feel it yikes **Do you guys actually taste the vomit? That's gross! Poor non-aphants lol**
* I can't believe you didn't experience the terrible puberty phase where you fantasize about your hot teacher, and in the middle of the class you start to ""see"" yourself banging them on the desk in front of you, so you awkwardly force yourself to think of something calming/disgusting to counter the feeling and not get aroused! Lucky you! **Never happened. But it's also not the best because I actually can't fantasize at all, not even voluntarily. On a semi-related note, I have synesthesia, one of my main types being mirror-touch. I feel physical sensations that I see. So if I'm watching porn, I feel it on my body.** 
* Now it's been a long time, so it's integrated now and all, but the way you learned left and right is amazing to me. It must have been difficult. I used to just recall an image [similar to this](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RglIrpfX_fs/WOfOkyhMuiI/AAAAAAAAW2o/5OkCxIMS_voZPYXpfn4iwRoewtPXWd56gCLcB/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/left_right.jpg), and just...know... I never even considered kids learning it another way **I would imagine I was holding a sword, and that would be my right hand. But I'm pretty good with my left too, so I would get confused. When my right is tired, I switch to my left. Eating, drawing, writing.** 
* Memories: For a lot of you, memories hold little sentimental value, your senses don't reactivate as much if you recall it **None at all. I have difficulty remembering things. Awful memory. If you trigger a memory in me, then I will recall facts about it, but not how I was feeling.** 
* I'm really happy most of you seem to be happy and/or have made peace with the discovery of being aphant. It's definitively different, and can be a double edge sword **Yes, I agree! For example, I have Bipolar Disorder and so when I think back on my depressive episodes, I can't remember how it felt. Which makes me quite apathetic but also protects me. It's almost like the depression never happened. All I have to remember it is cuts on my arm.** 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can do that if I want, You must understand that for us, it's something like [this](https://c4.wallpaperflare.com/wallpaper/743/787/679/book-imagination-hd-wallpaper-preview.jpg). It seems easier to me to remember an image/movie plot than words/concepts.  **I remember the vague ideas of the novel/movie. I'm a big reader. Love it. Not into movies. I can't pay attention for that long. I think aphants also have difficulty with faces. I'm always asking 'who's that actor' and my family gets so annoyed lmao.** 

>"" *And how TF do people drive and not get bored and start visualising shit and not the road?!?!😄* ""

I'm distracted all the time haha! You must focus sooo much better than us!!! :o **We are. We have good focus but it can be dull. I detest the idea of driving. It's like all my least favourite things in one. Directions, sensory overload, and not enough rules. It's bad.** 

>""*Turns out, normal people had scary monsters under their beds while growing up.*""

Children are often scared by what they see, with their eyes and their mind eyes, so they really see the big bad dragon eating them. At that age it's hard to tell the difference. YOU DIDN'T SEE [THAT](https://iigg-games.net/gimgs/little-nightmares-chapter-1-3/little-nightmares-pc-crack.jpg) UNDER YOUR BED ??? OMG!!! it was scary af. I'm shocked haha **No, I never did see monsters! I thought it was just something you would pretend was there! I didn't think you ACTUALLY saw it! Wtf??? That's fucking creepy. You guys are the real legends. The only time I've actually 'seen' things was when I was psychotic (manic episode).** 

* Research: I wonder the implications aphantasia has on healing, the placebo effect and such **(you must elaborate)**. If I feel pain and consciously visualize my pain going away, as a physical thing, the pain lessens. **(yes, a friend of mine mentioned this. I can't do it. My mirror-touch along with mirror-pain just makes the physical sensations more overwhelming).** The opposite is also true: when I rethink of the time I fractured my arm, I feel my arm weaken, shivers, like my body relives the stress **(doesn't happen to me. Interesting concept).** We know the impact of positive psychology and imagery on recovery, sport performance, etc. It would be an interesting thing to study in relation to aphantasia. **(I agree. Sign me up)** 
* Last question (finally, **(this is iconic, don't worry lol)** I know haha): Did you guys role play as kids? (the symbolic play kind) If you didn't see it, did you still like playing? **(never role-played. Didn't understand it, even as a kid)**"

InsanePeopleQuora,fljscu4,t3_fp9e38,1585225078.0,"Actually, there are records, letters, etc, showing that it was discussed on and off for many years. It was a whole ass thing. Up until the late 1800s, it was common for the first move to be played by white or black, including the great international tournament of 1851. The first recorded rule requiring White to move first, I think, was the rules handbook of the New York 1880 tournament. Later in 1889, world champion Steinitz advocated this as a standard. It’s not about race at all, though it could have been influenced by it (this is not supported by any evidence, simply a deduction based upon the era)."
Synesthesia,fljqu1x,t1_flj5rby,1585223646.0,"I love that! Linguistic intelligence. Interestingly enough, those with ASD struggle with what is known as “executive functioning” (cognitive abilities, being able to both set a goal and achieve in while following several steps and troubleshooting).

Scientists and psychologists have actually found out that those who speak more than one language tend to have enhanced cognitive abilities, and therefore have better executive functioning. 

People who speak more than one language are also five or six years later in developing conditions like dementia (the most common type being Alzheimer’s).

The best method to test executive functioning is known as the “stroop test”. Basically, you’re given words in colour and you have to say what colour the word is. The hardest part is that the words are the names of colours. So the word pink may be the colour blue, and you’ll be required to say blue. 

Since people who speak more than one language are better at separating the word from the meaning, they perform better as they are constantly suppressing one language in order to speak another.

Edit: I reread your comment. I find your skill to be quite common in the ASD (mainly, Asperger) community. Mimicking. Those with ASD are quick at seamlessly mimicking accents, tone of voice, intonation, pitch. It’s interesting. Is there a biological reason for this, or is it due to environmental factors? In most cases, it’s a mixture of both. So we can safely deduce that it’s both."

Synesthesia,flgoyxx,t3_foq8ez,1585147427.0,"In relation to ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), they have found that synesthesia is three times more common in those who have ASD than those who do not. 

Synesthesia is basically connections in the brain that are abnormal and researchers also think that perhaps those with ASD also have over-connectivity of neurons (which is why those with ASD can be hyper fixed on details).  

There is a mechanism called apoptosis in which we lose our neural connections from infancy as we grow up. The rate of this seems to be delayed in both synesthesia and ASD. As you know, they say that we all have the ability for synesthesia, though many seem to lose it as we grow up.

Scientists have also found that there are genetic components to both conditions. They are actually close to figuring out the individual genes involved in ASD, though the genes involved in Synesthesia are still unknown.

Scientists also propose that having both Synesthesia and ASD can be due to high/excessive serotonin level. This could also possibly lead to a decreased extracellular levels of serotonin in one hemisphere of the brain and a compensatory increase in the other hemisphere. 

On that subject, they have actually found in PET scans of people with ASD that serotonin levels were suppressed in the left hemisphere of the brain and excessive in the right.

So, to conclude, there is definitely a link between ASD and Synesthesia, said link probably being serotonin levels."

aspergers,flbrau1,t3_fnuuhe,1585010827.0,"I can identify with what you are stating. It’s a common psychological mechanism in which one who has been hurt too much puts up a condescending and unlikeable front in order to protect oneself. One has the belief that if one gives others a visible reason to dislike one, then others will be giving into one’s hypothesis (one being unlikeable). One also believes that this way, people aren’t given the chance to dislike who one is. It’s a matter of trust, or rather, lack off. I am extremely interested in psychology, and how best to learn about people? Observe. I observe a lot."
