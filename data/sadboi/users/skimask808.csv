I was shortly after diagnosed with TMJ and it caused a lot of weird symptoms. I would get a really sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and a lot of dental pain; even loose teeth.

You are creating your own definition of what is competitive that's why I don't feel like I have to prove anything to you. 

You refuse to get your own data to back up YOUR original claim. Which leads me to believe you have no idea what you're talking about either. Which is fine, but you refuse to admit you're wrong. You made the argument that controller players aren't doing better. That was your original argument that started all of this. Why do you think that almost all the top pros are doing a M&KB duo with a controller player? So they get the best of both worlds. The fact is I believe that around 3 players placed in WC on controller. That number in almost all events has definitely gone up. Leading me to believe that controller players are adapting and getting better. Unknown Army and Scoped are placing more often than not, and he's not the only controller player that is doing very well in the meta currently. Those are only two of the many placing currently. 

Again, you're just playing devil's advocate and looking to argue and I'm not sure why. You're creating your own definitions and rules for simple conversation."

There's nothing wrong with controller players doing better... There's more controller players competing than ever before. Some top KB&M pros are even switching or already switched to controller. You seem like you just want to argue to argue. What's the point serious question?

Not even an opinion, it's just a fact. We've had more time to adapt and get better. Plus there's a higher number of people playing on controller in events than before too from what I've been told.

ChrisChanSonichu,fp5yw12,t1_fp5vkle,1588342818.0,"I agree with a lot of what you said, but i disagree with the statement that the trolls were trying to help him get his act together. Maybe one or two of them (liquid Chris and Alec come to mind) but they both had their own ulterior motives and manipulated Chris. They took time out of their day to mentally torment an autistic teen/adult with the mind of a 12 year old. 

I dont agree that most of the trolls had good intentions. I was around for the 4chan /b days too, and most people who trolled were mean spirited. Whether it was for the lulz or not, it was cruel to take time out of your day to make fun of an autistic kid who doesn't understand what's going on. 

None of this makes up for the fact that Chris may had deserved some of it, but it was wrong and shouldn't had happened to begin with. Kasey and Liquid Chris took things too far. Alec with the adds the list goes on and on. His mental disability played a role in him not being able to take responsibility, I'm almost sure of it.

ChrisChanSonichu,fp5omwl,t1_fp5nqpx,1588336114.0,"Couldn't agree more, ultimately his parents are at fault for his downfall and lack of social skills.

I have a feeling she didn't want him working or would've encouraged it more.

TMJ,fo4orq8,t1_fo4omof,1587508316.0,"It was one of the worst, scariest pains I've ever felt. Almost like a pulled muscle with a touch of strept. throat. Just had to take it easy and it got better with time.

Drank lots of tea and coffee and that helped too"
TMJ,fo4nj83,t3_g5opbo,1587507664.0,"YES! I had the exact same problem and even had ultrasounds of the soft tissue on my neck, and a CT scan of my neck to make sure it wasn't something more serious. Definitely had swollen lymph nodes too. 

It eventually went away and hasn't come back since. But it was very scary at the time."
FortniteCompetitive,fnymnxs,t3_g4jca5,1587367985.0,Congrats! That's huge

DayzXbox,fnxxtk9,t1_fnxxnpz,1587348691.0,"You don't have to apologize, im just trying to give you a bit of perspective maybe from his point of view. Have a good night, starting over while very tough can be kind of rewarding too! And who knows maybe next time you'll get even better gear wherever you spawn :)"
DayzXbox,fnxxd1e,t1_fnxx70x,1587348391.0,"Okay... But it has happened to me, multiple times. Sure it upsets me but you can't get mad at the guy who shot you it's apart of the game. 99% of people aren't going to be friendly. I feel like you woulda shot him in the same way. What was he supposed to do, come announce himself that he was going to shoot you before taking a shot? Lol kinda silly IMO

You don't know how long he's played the game, or how old he is so calling names and acting like he must be new for killing you is ridiculous"
DayzXbox,fnxwovx,t3_g4jyji,1587347961.0,"If you had a sniper you would've done the same exact thing, don't say you wouldn't had. It doesn't make him a coward.. just more geared than you near a military checkpoint. 

Plus how do you know it was a sniper and not a rifle with iron sights? I know you're upset but don't hate on someone for how they chose to play the game."
Fortnite1v1,fnxorc6,t1_fnxoivt,1587343136.0,No need to apologize were all good I just misunderstood
Fortnite1v1,fnxnn8w,t1_fnxncvn,1587342455.0,"How is that a joke or you complimenting me? You said I was complaining.. lol I kinda get what you were saying now so no problem bud, no harm no foul"
Fortnite1v1,fnxla5g,t1_fnxh8cm,1587340999.0,"I'm not complaining at all, what's wrong with you??? I was telling him my stats so he knows I'm not too good either... No need to be rude/toxic"
DayzXbox,fnx7e18,t1_fnx6wa9,1587332939.0,"You literally can't criticize the game on console at all without getting downvoted to hell. People forget that BI has all but completely stopped development for the game on console. The roadmap for 2020 sounded horrible to me. There's no improvement. How is this game a full release game that costed some people 60$ +(?)

I think if people feel like they got their money worth and enjoy the game I fully support that, but them supporting the devs is just wrong at this point. They pushed Livonia out for more money before fixing the game. They pushed a battle Royale out on PC before fixing it on console. Almost all of the old developers have left the project... The game has turned into something disappointing. There's so much room for improvement but people will swear it's perfect, no big issues at all."
DayzXbox,fnx5vm0,t1_fnx54ji,1587332087.0,"Agreed, dude I swear on my life some of the people that stan Xbox DayZ are delusional."
Fortnite1v1,fnx5ist,t1_fnwwdjr,1587331883.0,Are you on NAE?
Fortnite1v1,fnx3rnm,t3_g42ooq,1587330907.0,I only have 54 solo wins but I'm down to practice a bit. Are you NAE?
