leagueoflegends,fema96e,t1_fem48qe,1579245693.0,Op.gg only pulls WR from korean challenger if you read the fine print. Yes i am in low elo and as much as i like to believe im ahead of the curve (silver 1 my peak) i still believe Viktor is just too weak to try and play especially due to his many counters

leagueoflegends,felr7c4,t1_felpl13,1579228955.0,Viktor takes damn near the longest to hit his powespikes and is famn near the most weak mid laner to ganks. He is extremely immobile and if you die before you dan afford your 1st hex core the game is essentiallu over for you. Im not sure if you are playing viktor because even in challenger he is seeing a below 40% winrate. Viktor is dog shot right now and will remain there for a while.
leagueoflegends,felpcex,t1_felp21l,1579227667.0,Viktor is dog shit unfortunately. But velkoz is sick! Im currently learning Cassiopeia and then might learn Ryze next. Like i said before if i could play Azir confidently and cosistently i would definitely play him quite a bit!
