relationships,fpx51zb,t3_gespew,1588975798.0,"I found out my boyfriend did this but he basically said he didn't realize it was any different than regular porn and said he would stop. I don't care that he watches porn in general but the paying part got to me.

Anyway, I talked to him about it - almost broke up with him over it because I felt cheated on. Why would he pay when I gave him these things for free?

I think guys are just wired these days to feel this need to see what they can't, because the media and porn industry in general shows them everything all the time without them even asking for it, and when they do want to go out of their way, they can literally see WHATEVER they want. 

Thankfully my boyfriend understood my feelings and stopped doing it. He even unfollowed girls that posted porn on Twitter, I didn't even ask him to. He didn't want to subject me to bad feelings and probably didn't want to subject himself constantly to the desire to see things like that constantly (he uses Twitter constantly).

If I found out he lied and was still doing it, I would leave. But for now I think he handled it very well - if I were you, I would talk to your boyfriend and explain your feelings and ask if he could please stop.

Ask him how he would feel if you were paying to see other men naked. If he isn't mature enough to think about your feelings as equal to his, leave him."
