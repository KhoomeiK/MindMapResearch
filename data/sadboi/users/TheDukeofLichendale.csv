Showerthoughts,fcncgkp,t1_fcn7ggj,1577808719.0,"I do agree that attempting to guilt someone into sharing ideas is not the right way to approach this (or any subject matter really). And of course, if you truly do not care, then well, you don't care. What I can do is try to shed some light on why *I* care and hope to at least inform you regarding the matter. 

The issue is multifaceted. The most basic reason for why we should care is that *if* one believes in the right to privacy, then the act of companies/government tracking/logging our data in itself is breaking that right to privacy. 

Some other reasons:

* Exclusion and exploitation of your data: Oftentimes, when data is collected, people are prevented from having knowledge about what is being collected and how that data is being used. An example of this is the PRISM surveillance program in the United States which wasn't really known to the general public until Edward Snowden leaked information on it. 

* Distortion of data: Individual data points don't provide a holistic view of whatever you're looking at. And therefore it's really easy to manipulate data to create misleading 'pictures' of someone or something. Let's say you just watched Breaking Bad and you became curious on how meth is made. So you buy a book on making methamphetamine. That data point, without the context of watching Breaking Bad, makes you look suspicious. Should your average Joe have to worry about the possible implications for every decision they make? Additionally, there are no laws to protect us against exploitation and distortion of our data. No measures or regulations have been put into place to stop any company/government from doing anything they want with our data. 

The largest issue with the argument of 'I have nothing to hide' is that people who use that argument are denying that there's an issue in the first place. And it's easy to fall into this kind of thinking because our threat to privacy isn't gonna happen all at once. We're not just going to wake up one day and live in a dystopian society. The change is gradual. It starts off as something small, like asking for our phone numbers. You'll think, ""oh, that's just my number, no harm in that!"" Then a few years later, it's the installation of surveillance cameras. ""So what?"" you'll think to yourself. ""It will help against criminal activity."" Little by little, more will be asked of you. But since the change is gradual, you'll be likely to go along with it. 

People also say that ""our gov't/these companies that collect data would never wish us harm,"" which is true in a lot of cases, but they can also unintentionally cause harm due to errors or carelessness. Think about data leaks due to security flaws. Identity theft due to data leaks is one example. 

You might be thinking, ""things like this will never happen."" But as a final point, I'd like to point out that these kinds of things are already happening in our world. And you need not look farther than China.  If you're curious, look into China's ""social credit system."" 

There's also [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/eddsh8/damn_this_is_crazy_a_common_topic_by_rogan_just/) (please excuse the subreddit lol) floating around of police in China interrogating someone based on comments he made online."

Because that’s similar to the right to privacy. Just because someone doesn’t have anything to hide doesn’t mean that their right to privacy is not important."
