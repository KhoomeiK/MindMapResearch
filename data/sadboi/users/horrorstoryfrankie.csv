BipolarReddit,fpeafx1,t1_fpbufsd,1588543595.0,it breaks my heart to hear that. My family instead just start back on the tv or something to cut me off and i KNOW that’s a sign of ok please
BipolarReddit,fpbjprz,t1_fpax6ln,1588471588.0,"thats interesting, maybe it soothes you"
BipolarReddit,fpbjoq0,t1_fpavcg9,1588471569.0,gonna time myself to see how long i can shut the fuck up for and watch the record be 30 seconds if im lucky
BipolarReddit,fpbjmr2,t1_fpazuoo,1588471533.0,"to be honest, mine right now is tik tok songs LMFAO"
BipolarReddit,fpbjlqk,t1_fpaozum,1588471516.0,It's amazing how you brought this up because this is indeed what i was doing and WHY i had to tell myself to shut up because i was singing the same musical riffs repeatedly!
BipolarReddit,fpa11t8,t1_fpa0v2a,1588438657.0,"thank you so much! good luck to you as well , i’ll keep everything you said in mind and try to be more open."
BipolarReddit,fpa08ki,t1_fp9zztx,1588438192.0,that’s interesting i’ve never had an increase in dosage so rapidly before mania. i’m so shy to discuss with my doctors how i really feel because i’m an idiot
BipolarReddit,fp9zvpy,t1_fp9zonp,1588437982.0,thats how i feel. it’s like im singing or saying things in my head but then i just blurt them out it’s so annoying
Miami,fp9zc8j,t1_fp9pf4y,1588437672.0,LMFAOOOOOO
BipolarReddit,fp9z9vk,t1_fp9z0r3,1588437636.0,no literally like i have no explanation. i had to move back in because of corona and it’s the worst just because that’s so annoying along with “just be quiet” like i’m working on it
BipolarReddit,fp9z4qu,t1_fp9ybtt,1588437553.0,this. made me. feel. so much better. i was just talking making jokes to myself and literally said out loud shut the fuck up you’re so annoying LMFAO
college,fp9al8n,t1_fp9akbb,1588420464.0,gotta love online schooling <33
BipolarReddit,fp9a7dn,t3_gbzxl4,1588420089.0,"Hello! I’m glad you got diagnosed and are going towards the right direction in regards to getting help ( your meds and therapy). Although therapy is a great help, sometimes talking to a friend or family member feels different since they’ve known you their whole life. Are you ok with sharing your diagnosis with one of them in order to sort of map out your emotions? 

Also, since you are newly diagnosed and feel as if lithium is making you slow make sure to keep track of how your meds make u feel day to day to better understand their effects entirely. You can also write alongside your emotions if you feel if you’d like to be more confidential about your emotions with family and friends ! I hope you feel better soon we are all helping and learning together how we can fight this !"
BipolarReddit,fp99ugl,t3_gc306d,1588419734.0,"It’s hard for loved ones to deal with these times. i’m sorry she has such a difficult time staying on her meds, but you should not be forced to deal with this either. Yes it’s tragic , but try to find a way to really get through to her or have her perhaps think of going to therapy? Unfortunately mental illness is a big factor in relationships but getting through it together is the goal. I wish you and her the best!"
Miami,fp99p7d,t3_gbgok1,1588419589.0,I was SO CONFUSED when i saw this too. the world probably doing a reverse global warming into a global cooling with how much less we are using GHG’s LMFAO
college,fp99mir,t1_fp99jlc,1588419516.0,"i had this super annoying professor who would have us take the test on zoom by us using our phone camera to show our WHOLE desk and then use the computer on lockdown browser while TA’s watched us on zoom and we were all muted. Times are Crazy, no problem"
college,fp99afb,t3_gbta5j,1588419171.0,don’t take it too hard ):
college,fp991pa,t3_gc4i91,1588418920.0,"Although a Withdrawal on your transcript may raise an eyebrow to some schools, along with a good explanation it can be just fine. Since you’re stating the class isn’t part of your major track and was just something for fun, i’m sure you can just discuss how “you were interested in this topic but decided it wasn’t for you”, or something along those lines. The only real disadvantage I would think is if you were to lose your money due to that course and how late you are withdrawing. Also don’t be disappointed! everyone goes through it"
college,fp98ujq,t3_gc4pjv,1588418713.0,"try to think of if as a regular exam so don’t wake up 10 mins earlier solely because you can. Find the time to wake up at least an hour early to get your mind and body ready and tuned for the exam. Stay comfy! that is one of the advantages. I also suggest setting up your desk ( if you use honor lock, proctor u, zoom proctoring,etc) due to the guidelines that some professors will ask. Also, if your exam is proctored, try not to move too much , as this will “flag” you and have your professor have to watch why ( it’s fine if you weren’t cheating and they could tell but why risk the assumption) Other than that, study as hard as you usually do and expect great results!"
college,fp98mv5,t3_gbydkp,1588418490.0,"Wow this is honestly so awful and unthoughtful of the university. Several students already find it difficult as is to pay tuition and with the times we’re in, they try to make us pay for things that just put money into their pockets and don’t benefit us. I hope your student body gathers and fights this because that’s just not okay."
college,fp98iz3,t3_gc1kjn,1588418376.0,congratulations! this must be a huge weight off your shoulders!
FIU,fp98c46,t1_fp8ds4h,1588418175.0,"this is the part  that really killed me about the email LMFAO , like yes let me give my few pennies to FIU before i go"
BipolarReddit,fp982zw,t1_fp980kn,1588417910.0,thank you! i’m sure they don’t mean it that way but they also don’t understand that our brains literally can just do what it pleases at times
mentalillness,fp97xoe,t3_gbvj73,1588417753.0,congrats! now you never need to speak to them again LMAO
mentalillness,fp8mke9,t1_fp8mgp2,1588396371.0,This was such a great response that makes sense thank u for being considerate on both parts. I’ll definitely start questioning things if this happens again (second time in a week)
mentalillness,fn638j0,t3_fzr7go,1586685667.0,it’s okay to not feel okay even when everyone tells you you have nothing to complain about
BipolarReddit,fk9x321,t1_fk9t869,1583985743.0,"I’m so happy for you ! When i got diagnosed I felt so weird and kind of sad honestly , but when they finally put that piece of the puzzle in by putting a name to my issues , it ended up being better in the long run"
BipolarReddit,f6efodv,t3_dqrw3f,1572803532.0,I completely understand you. So many friendships and relationships have been lost and it feels as if I have no control over them.
