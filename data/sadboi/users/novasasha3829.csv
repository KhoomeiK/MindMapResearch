HeroinHeroines,fjit0s4,t1_fell8vr,1583375071.0,"Could not have said it better. This and the fact that putting humans in private prisons is profitable. Money and profit are done away with altogether, when it comes to government or lawmaking, there will always be unjust laws that prey on the most vulnerable people in society.(addicts, the homeless, the poor, racial and cultural minorities, lgbt populations.) More than anything we as addicts and the homeless are one of the last groups of people that have yet to have a civil rights movement. I realize that this sounds stupid at first but when you really look at how badly addicts have been treated  throughout history, there is desperate need for change in the current medical, legal, and institutional systems that control every aspect of an addicts life. Not much has changed when you look at the first opium dens in the early British empire, to the abandoned buildings and camps that we live in now. From the very beginning it has been religion and specifically Christianity that has directly caused the horrific and inhuman atrocities and suffering that addicts have faced and currently face."

Addictedtotheneedle,ezg3xrm,t1_ezdwuix,1567890840.0,Ya the entire addiction treatment industry in this country is rigged to make you pay every cent you have for the promise that they will make you better. But more often than not they just traumatize you even more than you ever were and give you twice as many reasons to need drugs to forget about it. All treatment is based on religious ideals on addiction that are rooted in 12 step that is almost a hundred years old. There are basically no secular options. Every rehab tells you that if it doesn’t work it’s your fault. No other type of medical treatment blames the patient when they fail. It’s completely broken.

I love using heroin to make the paranoia and fear go away from using too much clear. Also it makes it so you can sleep sooner. Otherwise it takes me like 36 hours after taking the last shot, to fall asleep"
meth,ewx1azf,t3_cos6x4,1565841053.0,The first one was when I had broken out of a rehab that I was in. I was looking alll over Las Vegas for heroin and couldn’t find any all night. That’s what I was in rehab for but everyone was offering me clear for free so I tried it. The rush from shooting it was better than that of heroin and now I do both together and it’s the best discovery I have ever made.
confession,eww6wuh,t3_cq97ha,1565821892.0,Relapse is always inevitable. The American rehab and addiction treatment system is hundreds of years behind on the actual science and proven ways to approach addiction. Most of this is thanks to 12 step and the inclusion of religion in addiction medicine. This is unheard of in every other type of medical setting. The way to actually be safe and get to a point where drugs no longer control your life is through moderation. What me and my wife do is use moderately once every two weeks or so. Use harm prevention techniques. Have narcan and suboxone to protect us and to get us through the weeks. Most people age out of addiction to heroin if they make it past the 10 or 15 year mark. The problem is that many people end up dying before then because they use to excess and will try to use the same amount that they used before going cold turkey when they inevitably relapse.
homeless,ewpbgg7,t1_eweelvz,1565637568.0,"I specifically said I wasn’t talking about middle class people. However their indifference is terrible as well. It is not entitlement that is causing me to say these things. Unless entitlement means that I feel I deserve basic human rights like food, water, shelter, healthcare. Things that prevent me from dying. Things that are stolen from you the moment you are born in this system. We are born into a world where all the means of production, land to live in and grow food, and sources of water are owned by people that have billions of dollars at their disposal. There is no way to survive in this world with our succumbing to their will. We are born enslaved to capital. We are forced to spend the rest of our lives making money for other people, while we get 1% of the money that we make. Then are expected to be happy and just work like mindless sheep. Anyone who uses the word entitled to describe someone who is demanding a fair shot at life, is just repeating the same propaganda that has been shoved down our throats for hundreds of years. At no point in human history, since the invention of money, has a person ever been free. Until money and private (not personal) property is abolished. People will always be exploited and we as the homeless are used as examples for people not to step out of line. Drug addicts and the homeless are kept from ever getting better so that capitalists can point to them and say, “don’t ever stop working for my gain, don’t ever stop believing that everything is fine and that we have your best interests at heart.

Everyday you are being exploited and stolen from. Your boss pretends to be your friend but they are really just the prison guard keeping you in place. You should take every sick day you can and hopefully you have payed sick leave, which is now a luxury in this disgusting system. Don't sacrifice your health and your body just to make someone else $1000 that day and take back $1 for yourself.

homeless,ew07ddi,t3_clsnne,1564978075.0,"Pretty much everyone now a days is struggling. Inflation goes up every year. Yet the minimum wage stays the same and has been pretty stagnant for decades. Rents now cost 80% of people's minimum wage for studio apartments in many places due to gentrification. many minimum wage jobs will purposefully keep employees below full time hours to prevent having to pay benefits. Most people need two or three jobs just to survive. the price corporate profits have gone up exponentially in the last 50 years, yet wages have gone up by a small fraction of that. Everything costs so many times more than what they used to cost yet wages have barely gone up by tiny amounts. Most people have to sacrifice basic necessities like health insurance or food or car repairs to be able to pay their rent or mortgage. People working full time jobs don't qualify for government benefits like welfare or social security even though they can't afford basic necessities. It is all a product of corporate greed and the fact that we are in the late stages of a capitalistic system. CEOs now make 10 to 100 times more than what they made 50 years ago. Yet the minimum wage has barely doubled since then. Investors have take advantage of the recent recessions to buy up houses, apartments, farms, trailer parks and other types of housing when people couldnt afford them and they were foreclosed on. The result is that nearly half of people are forced to rent outrageously priced mediocre houses and apartments that cost between half and 3/4 of their income just to prevent homelessness. Once someone is homeless cities have systems in place that keep you in a cycle of homelessness. This is enforced camping tickets, illegal searches, and the bans on living in cars or rvs. People living on the streets are forced into paying huge fines for just trying to exist and survive. Homeless shelters are terrible places where people frequently are sexually assaulted, stolen from, given false promises of future help, and are given short time limits for how long they can stay. Most cities have many timesore homeless people than there is room in the shelters there. In order to get a place to stay for the night, people are forced to line up as early as 3pm to possibly get a bed. This prevent people from being able to find a job or work enough hours to ever be able to save enough for housing. Cops constantly unfairly search their belongings l, give out huge tickets for just existing, destroy there property or structures they are living in, and arrest them just for trying to survive. Many times the camping tickets add up with no way to pay them until they are arrested for this. Once they get into the prison system they are more likely to be convicted again. They are less likely to find any sort of well paying job or any job at all because of the arrest being on their record.many are forced to steal, or dumpster dive, or sell drugs just to make enough money to survive and pay fines. This system is so fundamentally corrupt and always has been. Until we address all these issues, 90% of people will suffer and live unfulfilling lives while the other 10% hoard more money, resources and property than they could ever spend or use in a thousand lifetimes. These problems are only getting worse as time goes on eventually people will wake up and we will take back what's ours and demand the lives that were stolen from us."

homeless,eu8oepn,t1_eu5ezhs,1563561130.0,"You are exactly what is wrong with the world and exactly the reason why people and things don't change for the better. The ideology of ""I did it so why can't they!?!"" Is so toxic and unhelpful to the issues that cause homelessness and drug addiction in the first place.  Most people are in these circumstances because of things outside pf their control. Everything was taken from them that they have worked their whole lives for. Not everyone was taught coping skills and ways to deal with adversity when they were younger. Some people have so much pain bottled up from their whole lives and all the bad things that have happened that there is no choice between either suicide or something that can take that pain and emptiness away. Plenty of other people were sucked into the opioid epidemic in the 90s. Doctors back then did not warn patients that pain killers were addictive. The pharmaceutical companies that made them hid this fact from the labels to sell more. Once the Gov't cracked down on this they took away there supply almost immediately and they had no choice to turn to heroin or meth to stop the withdrawal symptoms.  There is no free social support systems for addicts. Especially not for homeless addicts. The cold turkey method of quitting is less than %10 effective. All these factors combined people still blame us for doing drugs while homeless and blame us for when drugs cause our homelessness. It is especially that they have people so convinced that drug addicts= bad people, that someone that has experienced it, like you, thinks you are better than the rest of the drug addicts. Just because you are one of the 10% that could do it cold turkey, does not mean you are better in any way. Spewing your hatred for other drug addicts is only going to cause more people to be resistant to more progressive policies that would give clinically proven treatments to drug addicts and homeless people that would actually help them."
homeless,eu5err6,t1_eu4uytx,1563476012.0,Just because you had the strength to stop doesn't mean you are better than them. I know that when you first start living on the streets. You give up on life because everyone else has given up on you. Of course we turn to drugs and alcohol. It's the only way to fall asleep half the time when it's so cold or raining on you while you sleep. Don't blame those people for not having access to help or treatment. Blame the system and government that allows things like gentrification and unlivable wages that cause homelessness in the first place. Obviously the guys who are taking stuff from you and burning holes in your tent are messed up. But you cant really blame them for being desperate enough to have to steal from people.
