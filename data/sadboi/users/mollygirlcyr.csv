lexapro,ezkvx2g,t1_ezhysgx,1567967440.0,"Apparently vomiting all day isn’t a good thing & the doc switched me again to trazodone, an older antidepressant. Crossing my fingers that this is the one."
lexapro,eyrdl4w,t1_eyrao92,1567365889.0,Thanks. I do know it’s the drugs so I’m trying not to let it get me down. Sticking it out for another week at least
lexapro,eyr90u4,t1_eyqples,1567363072.0,Hi! Thanks for asking:-) I switched over to the Lexapro after 2 weeks of hell on the Viibryd and I have to say the Lexapro isn’t doing much better for me..  Anxiety is still very high; nausea to the point of vomiting and I’m feeling very depressed. Even the clonazepam isn’t touching this. I suspect that I’ll end up back on Paxil after I see the doctor this week.
lexapro,eydgt4n,t1_eydgjxt,1567018398.0,"Oh my gosh, no, but thank you for your concern. I’m lucky enough that despite debilitating anxiety, I’ve never had depression or suicidal thoughts. I know they often go hand in hand"
lexapro,eydfhb5,t1_eydd7kv,1567017735.0,"Thankfully I have 2 weeks off of work and clonazepam in the cupboard. I’m trying to ride it out as best I can without taking it, but it’s there if I need it. Mostly, I’m bullshitting myself that this is good cbt practice"
lexapro,eydacz8,t3_cwm99u,1567014645.0,Thank you for this. I’m only 5 days in and I’m struggling to push on through the anxiety and nausea.  It’s reassuring to hear that it does get better

antidepressants,ewv4bcp,t1_ewv3q4l,1565798348.0,Lovely. I’m taking it for anxiety and panic so I’m hoping this’ll go away. How long were you on it for?
