Coronavirus,fl2b6hd,t1_fl0x31y,1584747021.0,"Ugh but help I’m so scared still. I have badddd anxiety disorder and have been living with it for years using multiple medications, and I understand what you’re saying TOTALLY, and it makes total sense to me. I guess what’s really got me going about the coronavirus is the thought of getting it now that it’s so widespread. My husband and I have been quarantining since the 13th with our dog. But every time I go outside to let her go to the bathroom (we live in an apartment) or think about us having to go to the store or anywhere, I feel like we’re in danger! I feel like I’m just constantly waiting for the symptoms to hit me. Or him. (We’re 24 and 25) We have been very good about keeping sanitized and everything and like I said, we’ve been basically holed up in our apartment since the 13th. THE WHAT IF FACTOR IS MAKING ME LOSE MY DAMN MIND!"

We are portrayed as violent and selfish people in the media and that’s what sickens me.  I understand it’s not a “glamorous disorder”, trust me, but it’s not an inherently violent or homicidal disorder."
