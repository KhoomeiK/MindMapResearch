berkeley,fql3k3d,t1_fqh1lkq,1589445014.0,"Thanks for this! This gives me a lot to think about. Lol I do fear judgement of other people, I think one of the toxic parts of silicon valley culture is trying your best but then still feeling like people look down on you for not doing more than that.

I think if there's a good part of quarantine, it's that I've been able to step away from environments where people define themselves by such metrics, but it's something I've still gotta work on. COVID-19 and all the layoffs kinda makes you see what's really important in life, when it all gets taken away from you...

But yeah, thanks again! :)"
berkeley,fql38k8,t1_fqi47g8,1589444701.0,"Yeah I remember recruiting for clubs... I was also rejected a lot as a freshman, but I'm now really involved in multiple CS clubs, so it really does show that if you work hard enough at something, you'll eventually get accepted and it'll all work out. :)"
berkeley,fql34vt,t1_fqhpx3d,1589444601.0,This is true. I keep asking if I'm good enough but if I look back at where I was a year ago it's pretty comforting! Thank you :)
berkeley,fql2rga,t1_fqi2h91,1589444235.0,"Thanks this gives me a lot to think about! And yeah, I honestly could consider TA'ing. I've been a lab assistant/tutor before and loved that."
berkeley,fql2gr3,t1_fqjkmib,1589443947.0,"Yeah, I've had friends who were in the recruitment process for some companies for months with continuous updates and extra steps to take, but never a definite yes or no. I'm from the area, and the toxic culture really does make this whole process a lot less enjoyable..."
berkeley,fql2c0h,t1_fqi8u7y,1589443824.0,"Yeah I agree! I made this post because I can handle other annoying inconveniences pretty well, like social rejection, general responsibilities, etc. but for some reason internship recruitment somehow stands out as something much worse. I know what I feel towards it is disproportional to what it actually is, cold emailing a bunch of people and putting on a smile to impress on its own is nbd. I think for myself and for others, a lot of the cutthroat/toxic environmental factors just blow the negatives out of proportion. But yeah, it's important to take note of that. Thanks!"
berkeley,fql1rpq,t1_fqi8p45,1589443283.0,"Yeah, I definitely see what you mean. And yeah, I remember when I was applying to colleges I didn't tell anyone anything, which helped me avoid a lot of drama. I think it's worth doing the same for recruiting!"
berkeley,fql0yvw,t1_fqiajca,1589442509.0,"That sounds really interesting. I've also considered working at an industry for a few years before applying to grad school, I feel like a) grad schools might care a \*little\* less about undergrad GPA if I've got some solid years of industry experience under my belt and 2) working could make the money situation a little more manageable. 

And I agree, I think stepping out of the Berkeley EECS environment could do me some good. If there's one good part of quarantine, it's that time away has helped me see my values and needs a lot more clearly -- and what I've realized is that I love CS, but that the toxicity I complain about in my post sometimes stops me from seeing that.

Thanks! :)"
berkeley,fql0fsl,t1_fqicgd1,1589442001.0,"Honestly... I think I'd be down to intern somewhere like that to start off with. I hear about people who stay in recruiting for the big 5 for months without a definite answer, with all sorts of levels and interviews and whatnot. I feel like a more lowkey place would have a much different recruitment process"
berkeley,fql08sh,t1_fqj42mj,1589441813.0,">Funny, this is the thing I hate the MOST out of CS recruiting; mindlessly grinding problems that have zero meaning or impact on anything, and are arguably a gigantic waste of time.

Oh that's so interesting. I mean I kinda get it, grinding problems over and over doesn't really produce anything of value. Maybe I just haven't gotten tired of it yet LOL"
berkeley,fql01ni,t1_fqkor8d,1589441622.0,"Honestly... it's not over till it's over, also who knows what if you do perfect on standardized testing? Also you can apply multiple times. I think I might consider working in industry for a bit and then trying to get a phd. I have a feeling GPA matters a little less with some years of work under your belt.

At least that's what I try to tell myself?"

To answer your second question, I’ve been taking 50mg Zoloft and 10mg Adderall together (for depression and ADHD) every morning for around two weeks now and I haven’t had any side effects other than my jaw kind of hurting. I’m not sure how Vyvanse works in comparison to Adderall, but it’s worked just fine for myself. You could maybe look into switching or getting a higher dosage?"
bisexual,fo5x6k2,t3_g5vi79,1587538644.0,"When I was thirdteen I had a crush on a boy but a subconscious and much deeper crush on one of my best friends who was a girl. I remember spending time with her and just wanting nothing more than to be physically near her, I remembered thinking to myself that I would much rather hold hands with her than the boy I liked. Comparing those attractions kinda made it all click for me. I figured if I liked her that much, there was no way I was straight."
EatingDisorders,fo5j52m,t1_fo5gotv,1587526913.0,"Yes exactly! Also @OP I empathize with feeling like your eating disorder is fake, a very dangerous (and common) part of ED’s in general is thinking they’re fake because a lot of people let themselves do more dangerous behavior if they think their previous mindset was healthy. Feel free to DM me if you ever need someone to talk to!"
EatingDisorders,fo26onc,t3_g59ymb,1587451448.0,"I mean... one thing to ask is, could someone who doesn't have disordered eating habits actually want to force themselves to throw up to be skinny? Would they commit these actions knowing it could become a life-threatening habit, if they were really doing okay?

To me, it makes the most sense to see everything as on a spectrum of some sort. I think the  desire to prioritize being skinny over basic needs in and of itself indicates a pattern of thought that reflects disordered eating. And of course, there's extremes on the other end."

AnorexiaNervosa,fn0gctf,t3_fych9q,1586541433.0,"I just remember in second grade my school decided to teach us about weight as a scientific concept (ie. what is a pound vs kg vs ounce). But then our teacher made everyone stand in a line, weigh them, and put that number on the whiteboard. I remember the girl who weighed the most started crying. The girls who weighed the least were cheering. I just remember hoping that night that one day I would be like those girls who weighed the least. I guess... 12 years later and I don’t feel any different. Kids are impressionable :("
