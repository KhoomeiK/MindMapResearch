A Christian with Jewish heritage is going to be under attack from anti-semitism as much as a person that practices Judaism. I'm not jewish and I can recognize there are many things to criticize that exist in Judaism,  but criticizing a religion is not the same as racial hatred which is anti-semitism. For what it's worth I dont agree with the person you responded to either. I'm an atheist and I support being critical of religion but I think it's wrong to make blind statements about any person based only on religion.  I'm just saying criticizing christianity is not the same as anti-semitism, and criticizing the beliefs and practices of Judaism is also not anti-semitism.  Anti-semitism is look at every one with a jewish heritage as a whole and making claims and stereotypes about them and using it as an excuse to hate them or treat them differently. When you criticize religion you need to still be open to seeing others as individuals.  A big difference between Judaism and christianity is that christianity doesnt have a specific racial group associated with it Judaism does so you cant make a 1 to 1 comparison between the 2  anti-Christian is far more different than anti-semitism, anti-semitism isnt even the same as being critical the religion of Judaism."
