self,ez4go9g,t1_ez4dtyi,1567686579.0,"It feels like absolute shit. You try your best to get out of the acquaintance-zone but it's like trying to walk through a sea of grease. I know them really well, because it has always been me who takes the initiative to ask them how their day had been. I don't understand how people can just ignore you and put you through like that. The only time they take note of me and I seem to exist is when we're talking face-to-face. And you're right. This shitty and clusterfucked society is cruel, cold, and insouciant. No one cares, regardless of how much you care. After I die, only then they would mutter shit like how I was an amazing person with a bright future. And likewise, I feel that I'm cursed to be the second-choice, forever.

BTW, I move this to r/depression instead. Seems like a better place for it."

I'd suggest telling him straight up that his behavior is slightly disconcerting, but don't put it too bluntly; tell him that he's a tad overstepping your boundaries. He should understand.

He reminds me of myself a few years back; I was in a similar situation; just that I had been extremely depressed and suicidal for quite a long time already and had no idea what in the hell I was doing."
