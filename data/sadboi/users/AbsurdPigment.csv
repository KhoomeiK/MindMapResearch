Something my therapist has advised me to do is 1. try grounding exercises  2. look at something calming 3. try to interrupt the thoughts.

I've had the time and space to do it in class. I would take a few deep breathes, name 5 things I could see, 4 things I could feel, 3 things I could hear, 2 things I could taste and 1 thing I could smell (You can change the sensations, but I find this one works well since I don't have a great sense of smell).   
Or I would take a few deep breathes and tune into the feeling of my clothes against my skin, my weight against the chair.   
Or I draw the infinity symbol on a piece of paper or with a finger on my skin, and match it with my breathing. 

I would either look out the window at the trees and sky, or at a the stickers I have on my laptop. I specifically chose stickers that are pleasant, calming or funny.

And I would try to stop monitoring my classmate's every move. Being aware that I'm hypervigilant kinda helps me.

I really want tomorrow to go well for you. I really really want you to be able to live life. I really want you to function. I respect your decision and your dedication, and I am rooting for you.

\-----

What you said about not being able to play piano really struck a cord with me. For a long time I wasn't able to read or write, and as a die-hard English major, this was a major blow to my sense of self-worth. I felt incomplete without that ability. I also couldn't clean, study, shop, socialize - I just couldn't function. I would watch Netflix all day and cry.

During that time, my therapist sat me down and explained to me Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. If you're already familiar with it, then take this as a gentle reminder. If you don't know it, maybe it will help you sort some things out. [https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html)

If you look at the chart, you'll see a pyramid that represents the stages of mental function and needs. You need to mostly fulfill the basic needs before moving on to the next - so in order to be creative, you have to feel safe. PTSD means not feeling safe. Even if logically you think you're safe, physiologically we're all stuck in fight-or-flight mode, evidenced by flashbacks and extreme anxiety. It's exhausting. So it's really really hard to do anything other than trying to feel safe with this disease. 

Additionally, I've been reading The Body Keeps the Score, and the author explains how our brain functions during flashbacks. When we experience a flashback, the left hemisphere deactivates. That's the hemisphere that helps you keep time and practice patterns while practicing piano, it hold Broca's area which is where our function for speech comes from, and it keeps chronological order resulting in a flashback feeling like it is currently happening. Science also now reports that humans are not predominantly right or left brained - we use both hemispheres fairly equally during tasks. Half of our brain partly shuts down with PTSD. It isn't our fault.

There's a lot more to it, but these are the things that I understand so far. I can get sources if you'd like that. I know that there are even more changes and more ways to explain dysfunction and PTSD, but this is just what I know so far. 

Really, what I want to convey above all to you is that there are biological functions that we can't control, so you're not at fault for your dysfunction. It isn't because you're lazy or scared or indulgent. It's because you have PTSD. I think that breaking away from distractions is going down the right path, but I'm worried that you're being too hard on yourself.  I still 100% want tomorrow to be a productive day for you - you deserve it. But I also want you to feel self-love and understanding."
CPTSD,fqytplt,t3_gljeb9,1589754394.0,"I'm so so sorry that this has happened to you. It wasn't your fault. An abuser chooses to abuse - it is their fault. You can't blame someone for being shot because they aren't wearing a bullet proof vest.

I'm really sorry. It sounds like right now you don't need to be told to ""pull yourself up from your bootstraps."" No matter if they mean well or not, it is a dismissive statement. They may be talking from their own experiences and not tuning into yours. It sounds like they're trying to fix you instead of just letting you rest and validating you.

Once again, I'm so sorry. I know you're trying, and you're strong for doing so. You're really strong just for existing right now. I'm really proud of you. 

From what I understand, it seems like you want to get stronger, but you feel stuck. It is ok to be there. It sucks, but it's ok. You're not inferior in any way. If it helps, I've also experienced that. I've known logically what to do, but when it all happened, I couldn't do it. I just couldn't.

That shows that your logical mind is healing faster than your emotional body, which happens to all trauma survivors - especially if your trauma is layered. What has kept you safe in the past is coded in our emotional body, and it takes a long time to teach it otherwise. It takes a lot of work to break that code, and above all it takes safe experiences. It doesn't sound like you've had a lot of those.

Freezing wasn't your fault. It was the fault of your past abuse, and it certainly isn't your fault for not already processing that. Trauma processing takes the time it demands, and it's really hard to get better in an environment that isn't safe. Your body doesn't buy into reasoning - it performs based on experience. Simply being told to ""not be a victim"" won't do a thing.

Once again, it isn't your fault. Your pain is valid, and your abuser is beyond shitty. Your friends seem like they are approaching you with love but not with sensitivity. I hope you have a trauma-informed therapist or friend to just sit with you and love you in the way you deserve. I'm so so sorry you went through that and so soon. Take the time you need. Do what you need to do. One day you'll be the strong person you're determined to be, but it takes time.

CPTSD,fqynjae,t3_glmqkj,1589751483.0,"I've in a somewhat similar spot.

My classes just ended. I did terribly in those classes. I didn't do the homework or the projects. It was terrible and a constant source of stress. But now that classes are over, I'm seeing their faces and hearing their voices. The anger and fear are horrible. I wish I was still dealing with academic stress.

But in therapy, I've learned two things about this situation:

1. You do need to feel your emotions, but you need to do it when you have access to helpful resources, either internal or external and 2. Distractions can be helpful.

Right now, I'm in a situation where I can't express my emotions because they will be punished by my parents, so my therapist advises to engage in distractions. But the goal we've laid out is eventually for be to be really messy with my emotions - to feel them and move them out of the body. Sometimes I only feel like I can handle a little bit of that processing only when she is around to help. Otherwise, I'm trapped in a mind full of flashbacks and can't get out. The goal is to be emotionally distant enough from those memories so that you can sort them out, rather than being totally consumed.

I don't know your situation, but I feel for you. I really hope you can play piano. I admire your resolve and push to get better, but I am worried that you might have an intense day tomorrow. I'm wondering if it might be helpful to have a period of the day where you get really messy, and still have access to distractions at other times? To not quite quit cold turkey? Because, as you said, it is overwhelming. So maybe you can just dip your toe into it all and avoid being fully submerged? 

I'm not a therapist, and I don't know if you're looking for advice. If not, I'm sorry.  Are you in contact with a therapist?

I wish you lots of luck and love. I'll be thinking about you"
CPTSD,fqyj94h,t3_glky9h,1589749476.0,"I have several different reactions to this, ya know? This post stirs up a lot of different thoughts in my mind, and I think I just need to lay it out.

For one, I was excited to see this post because Ive been thinking of making a similar post - exploring a thought that may be invalidating to others. I remember when this sub exploded when a person was distressed due to their lack of empathy and people attacked them instead of really understanding their position. My post was going to be about how I can't emphasize with people who are heartbroken after a relationship. (It makes me roll my eyes, but probably bc Ive never loved someone like that). So thank you for posting this, and I appreciate the disclaimer.

To address your post, I think there are some things at work there, but I dont think anyone is trolling us? Mostly because I think this diagnosis is too niche for someone to troll. I could definitely be wrong.

I think that two things are happening with that kind of post: looking to get their emotional needs met and genuinely being blind to abuse.

I think that people with cPTSD and that level of abuse never got their emotional needs met as a child. Parents that are that terrible cant look into and address their child's inner state - theyre too obsessed with themselves. So those kids grow up feeling empty, and crave being seen and feeling empathy. I think those posts are attempts to be seen in ways in which they dont appear needy by asking if theyre overreacting. I think they are requests to fill their emotional emptiness.

Or they really are blind. I think that the more extreme the abuse is, the more extreme the doubt is, especially if youre still experiencing the abuse. With clarity comes anger, and anger isnt allowed in abusive households, ya know? When I get angry at my dad, he sits me down and doesnt leave until I admit that I overreacted (because he is an unempathetic piece of shit.)

So the doubt really kicks in, and in a way keeps you safe even if it isnt healthy. Also, if every reaction you have to abuse is deemed ""overreacting"" as a way for the abuser to avoid their consequences, I can see why people would reach out to a third party. I think they are exploring they idea that they might be a victim to abuse by reaching out - they dont have any level of awareness yet.

I think being defensive is valid, especially if youre used to people using their emotions to manipulate you. This isnt totally the same, but I have a really hard time connecting to people who say they have cPTSD or PTSD irl. I always doubt them. I dont know why I do. I also have to hold myself back from getting competitive with them, as if I have to prove myself. Maybe because I've been emotionally invalidated and abused for so long. Idk."

That doubt is a voice trying to avoid feeling those terrifying emotions. Whether it is because it is scary and painful, or if it feels unsafe to. That doubt is actually evidence that you've been through trauma. People who havent been through trauma dont deal with that voice.

Since I had to move in with my parents, Ive been dealing with doubt tenfold. I can't feel those emotions here AND maintain the peace. I'd kill them.

I just kind of honor that doubt and its role. I know it is a part of me trying to protedt me. But I acknowledge that I'm in denial. And that actually helps a lot. I dont deny that I'm in denial. It still sucks, but it helps."

No. I am fighting to escape an abusive family structure. I am fighting to go no contact. I am fighting to be treated like a human being for the first time in my life.   


This is not your standard coming-of-age fight, and dismissing it as such makes it evident that you don't know what's actually going on. And it actually makes me question what's actually going on too. But the devil is in the details, I guess. Most people don't fight because their mom thinks she knows your feelings better than you do and is angry that you would say otherwise. ""How dare you say that you're happy when I *know for a fact* that you're mad!"" like, what?"
AmItheAsshole,fpfkzv8,t3_gd3p8p,1588574509.0,"YWBTA. But it's good that you're questioning this decision because that shows you care, and are possibly open to change.

It sounds like you love your daughter very much, but you're letting fear speak instead of love. Your daughter is setting boundaries, asking for respect, and becoming her own separate person. That can be scary, especially if your daughter is disabled and has needed additional help throughout her life.

But this is good for your daughter. She is gaining independence, confidence and her voice. SHE NEEDS THAT FOR THE REAL WORLD, and now is the time to start developing and encouraging it. She will gain a little distance from you, but she'll be ok. But if you try to control and keep her close because of that fear, she will run away. Because nobody likes to be controlled.

For instance, she has recently set a boundary with you - being called ""special needs"" makes her uncomfortable. It really doesn't matter where and how she came to this conclusion - it is a boundary. Fear tells you that she is deviating and that you are going to lose her, so you don't stop. You continue to call her ""special needs"" and make her uncomfortable. It's like continuing to stab her with a fork each time. That makes her rightfully angry. 

If you want to love her, respect her. Stop making her uncomfortable. I know you love her with all your heart, but love has to be expressed to be felt. Love is what you do. Love is respect.  It is a simple switch that will improve your relationship with your daughter because you show her that you love her. 

Telling her that she can't talk to her friend anymore would be just an awful thing to do. That would be controlling, which never works. You can't control people and expect them to stay close. And your daughter is going to grow up, make her own opinions and decisions regardless of her friends. She is her own person, and whether or not she is going to be strong and resilient is up to the choices you make right now. 

I would recommend researching boundaries and codependency, and maybe start seeing a therapist. This post is personal for me because my dad did the same thing - didn't respect my boundaries because that distance scared him. He never showed me love despite loving me more than anything, and that has deeply fucked me up. I fully plan on going no contact with him until he goes to therapy and changes his behavior. Don't be like us. Please."

Therapy is a fantastic tool! It works the best when the therapist is a good fit. I encourage everyone to walk into their first therapy session with a new therapist as a critic - sampling rather than committing. Get a gauge for how much they talk, if they talk down to you, if they ask questions, if they annoy you, how they talk about the SA, etc. Also question what their methods of therapy are, and their overall framework for your journey. For the most part, just having a therapist makes this journey easier, but having one that's a good-fit makes a big difference.

Across the board, therapy is hard. It feels like you're being broken into pieces so that you can rebuild a better version of yourself. I used to schedule my therapy on days I didn't have class or other commitments because I knew I would feel drained, upset, anxious - aka a mess. But it works.

The trauma-therapy I am in now is fantastic. My therapist is trauma-specialized, which I love. She slowly established trust with me, and I just talked to her about subjects and symptoms connected to the SA. Slowly, we are circling closer and closer to the actual event. But I can't really talk about the details yet, and I tell her that if I need to. Honestly, even though we haven't gone into details about the abuse, my life now compared to a few months ago when I started with her is drastically different, and for the better.

The main emotions therapists work with during SA victims is feelings of guilt, shame, embarrassment, feeling fundamentally bad, doubt, fear/anxiety, anger.  (TBH I didn't actually feel anything when I started, and they work with that too). This therapy is about feeling those emotions and letting them pass. I recently had a huge source of guilt I'd been holding onto for years towards an event dissolve away in therapy. This stuff works.   


 It also helps you reconstruct your perspective of the world as a safe-ish place, and give you resources to feel powerful. Establishing boundaries and making healthy connections with others are also things you work on in this kind of therapy.

In therapy I learned that the main goal in trauma work is to move the energy of years of unfelt emotions out of the body, and I believe that that is the energy you are starting to feel.

That means crying when you feel like you need to cry. Screaming if you feel the need to scream. Emotions and pain demand to be felt, and the only way to get that energy out is to honor it, feel it, then move past it. That may be the next stage for you in your healing.

&#x200B;

One assignment I learned from therapy is to write down when I am having an emotion. To initially just write ""I am having an emotion,"" if that is all I can do. The next step is to write why I am feeling that way, what the feeling is, and how it feels in the body.

For example, feeling like ""I'm not good enough"" when I perceive rejection feels like my throat and stomach have caved in. Or anxiety is a green clump in my stomach that extends up the back of my throat. Panic and stress are push on the insides of my head and make me clench my eyes.

It's a way to connect to the emotional body and feel what you need to feel. My therapist also has recommended exercise and especially yoga. I'm doing the 30-days of yoga challenge with Adriene for free on YouTube. It is for beginners, and the other day I just started sobbing while in tree pose. It is very helpful for grounding.

Do you have a therapist?

There are lots of grounding techniques out there, but I'd encourage you to consult with a therapist. This level of dissociation is indicative that your life is too difficult to stay present for. Dissociation is a defense mechanism in which the brain catapults itself into space. It kicks in when things aren't going well. There are really intense emotions that you're not ready to deal with, which is ok. 

Coming out of dissociation means facing that emotional distress, and it would be safer, more effective and easier to ground yourself with a therapist involved.

You're ok where you are right now. If this is how you need to be, it is how you need to be. If it makes you feel better, I'm a little dissociated too as I write this. But dissociation can make it difficult to function and connect. Plus, emotions tell us who we are, help you make the right choices for yourself, and protect you from toxic people or abuse. Being able to feel is a big positive.

Eventually, when you're ready, the goal would be to become grounded. And a therapist can help ready you. Sending well wishes, and feel free to DM me if you need to talk."

A vital changing point for me was partial hospitalization program after I hit my rock-bottom. It was a safe environment that took care of me. I hated it at the time, but as time goes on, the gratitude sinks deeper.

It taught me all the things I wasn't taught as a child and undid the things my abusive childhood did teach.

There I learned that I was numb, had an abusive childhood and was codependent. I learned about my toxic core beliefs, about managing expectations, values and morals, who I was, and about boundaries. Self-love has slowly been following, and is filling holes left by a toxic life. I started finding moments of happiness in shitty days, and that was a turning point.

I'm impressed with how well you've articulated that kind of state, and I feel weird reading it because I've never put it into words. It's like you've done the work for me.

I'm not sure if this will help, but having this kind of understanding of the situation and posting this is indicative of progress. You have moments of clarity that that doubting-voice is a little bitch, and that's progress. You're not letting denial win - you're battling it.

 It's fucking exhausting, and you have to fight to feel human, and I don't envy you at all.

I just want to say that what you're experiencing is evidence of cPTSD. The doubt, the clarity, the anger, the dissociation, the hopelessness for the future, the grieving of your old-self. It's terrible, but this is all validation. And that doubt? That doubt is a voice trying to pretend it all doesn't exist to attempt to protect you from those emotions. The same with dissociation. All trauma-responses.

Is there anything physical you can do right now? Yoga, running, screaming into a pillow, going for a walk? And I hope you get in touch with your therapist soon. Or get to punch something. If anything, I hope you find this comment validating, and you find relief soon."

Hi (Prof),

I hope this email finds you well and happy.  


I am writing this because I am falling behind in your class. This quarantine has brought me back to my abusive childhood home, and I'm finding it nearly impossible to engage with school when I don't feel safe. I would love to as I like to learn and I like your class, but it is getting increasingly difficult.  


At the moment, I am trying to switch all my classes to Credit/No credit, and am in touch with SAA. Right now, I was wondering if you could please give me an extension on the Dependent-t test homework assignment until tomorrow? I would be very grateful if you could, but I understand if that is too much/doesn't work.  


Thank you,

Nothing about this seems ok, and it is a big red flag. I just want to lay bare the dynamic I am seeing. I don't think there is any simple solution, and I'm worried that his control and possessiveness has seeped into other areas of the relationship without you noticing.

I got in the car and turned on the radio and didnt care about the music for the first time.

I left my apartment for a package of razors.
I went to Whole Foods to get dinner first. Then to Home Depot. I bought a pack of razors and a succulent. 

That will always stick with me. I bought something that I'd have to stay alive to care for and something I was going to end my life with in the same purchase. I spent quite a bit of time choosing the succulent.

I ate a whole package of cookies in my car and my Whole Foods dinner while crying in the parking lot. I was crying over the pain, the trauma, the loneliness and thinking that my poor roommate would find my body when she came back in a few weeks.

When I was back at my apartment I went to go run the bath. A guy invited himself over though I didnt want him to come. He asked me if I was going to kill myself and I said yeah. He then took all the sharp stuff out of my apartment and eventually set up a suicide-watch at his apartment.

Then him and his roommate got me drunk and raped me. I didnt care since I was on my way out anyway. My goal each and every day from then on was to die. The abuse continued for a few months until I tried to crash my car. I had to be hospitalized and live with my abusive parents.

That was over a year ago. Still here and no longer suicidal, but still dealing with PTSD. Went home at the beginning of covid before it became a quarantine. Currently trying to escape my abusive childhood home. It kinda gets overwhelming when I think about everything I've endured, especially these past few years, but I'm taking it one step at a time."

CPTSD,fnmb6st,t1_fnl9qx9,1587068288.0,"Hey! I'm not super confident in my advice, but I'll share what I can! I'll give it a shot!

I recognized it as a traumatic response because I was listening to my needs, my responses and my body. Trauma for me is when my boundaries are crossed, I feel a lack of control, and my fight-or-flight response is heavily activated.   


I broke down the situation as it was happening:

1. I was angry. At what? I didn't know. And I know that that is ok. I was completely in my right to have an emotion without knowing why.
2. I wanted to deal with it privately. I have the right to be alone, just as every human does. That was my right.
3. My dad came to confront me and tell me to stop feeling angry. I did not want him there. My father does not have the right to my presence or to tell me how to feel, and I knew it. I communicated that, and told him in explicit terms that he was violating my boundary. I know that anger comes when our boundaries are violated, and that is universal. I told him that.
4. I was getting angrier, and that was my right. It was natural since he wasn't respecting me right to be alone. He was getting angry because I wouldn't allow him to cross my boundary, and that was coming from a place of entitlement. That was not right.
5. He ran at me with the intent to hurt me. I stood up and stood my ground, pushing him away and telling him to not touch me. My fight-or-flight response was activated, and his actions were completely out of place. I felt my boundaries being crossed, and they were being crossed with rage, aggression and disrespect. He was trying to take away my control. That is trauma.

He left, and did other shitty things that were horrifically shitty, but not traumatizing. He victimized himself, tried to make me feel like the aggressor, and he later apologized in a sweet voice. I know that those are tactics aggressors use to maintain a relationship and control.

Then, of course, the aftermath with the typical symptoms after being traumatized. Insomnia, fear of him, hypervigilance, nightmares and what have you. (I'm better now - it still hurts, but I've processed it enough to write it down, and it is my choice to do so).

So, I think it is all therapy. Therapy equipped me with the terminology and the connection to myself in order to see the situation as it was. I really hoped this helped."

I actually feel lost with this new knowledge. There's a part of me that wants to defend my parents and another part that doesn't want to think too much about it. My childhood was spent trying to make everything seem fine to me and to other people. Breaking out of the role is going to be tough, and that therapy session felt like a big crack. Right now I'm living with my family in my childhood home due to this quarantine, so I don't think this is the time to really push myself out.

The second question is a bit tough since I don't really have a frame of reference. Though having my dad demolish any boundary I tried to put up has affected me a lot. Boundaries prohibits full obsession and emersion, so they weren't allowed. Having no boundaries growing up was horrible and it really fucked me up with other relationships. I think I can honestly say that I've never have had a healthy friendship or relationship - romantic, platonic or professional. 

I'm working so very hard on developing healthy friendships now that I'm older (going on 22), and I have frequent check-ins with my therapist to see if I am doing it right/if it is healthy.

I've had it for about a year and a half now, and I'm happy to report that it gets better with time. In the beginning, I would twitch when anything stressful happened. I had to preface class presentations with a warning in case I twitched. One time my roommate brought home a very smelly incense diffuser which caused me to twitch. Thinking about homework = twitch.

Now it doesn't even happen every time I am triggered.

Now it kinda works as a sounding system. Sometimes I get triggered but don't know it/accept it due to dissociation and doubt. But my body will twitch, and that tells me something is wrong.

For one, you wouldn't be ""taking a break."" Trauma work is not a break. It is shitty. It hurts. It fucking sucks because you want a break from all the hurt caused by constant trauma, but therapy hurts just as much, if not more. I'm in year three of therapy, and I still come out of my sessions in pain and feeling like a fragmented version of myself. Therapy and progress are positive things, but nobody really tells you how much it hurts. 

Maybe take that approach to your parents? Or, if you don't trust that they can understand that, at least try to take that to heart for yourself. Imagine you have a broken leg. You wouldn't call yourself a ""bum ass 19 year old"" if you decided to let it heal instead of continuing to run on it.

If you don't do therapy/self-help books/trauma work, you're stuck. You're just delaying the inevitable pain of moving forward.

And yeah, I can totally see how therapy sessions three weeks apart aren't doing it. Trauma work requires regular, frequent meetings. Also, why waste your time and money on sessions that aren't moving you forward? Of course you want something productive. I get it. 

I'm in therapy right now. I have a phone call once a week for an hour with a true trauma specialist.

Are you familiar with Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs? Essentially, it says humans are unable to do *anything* unless they first feel safe. [https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) When I was hit with PTSD, I couldn't even read for months. You aren't defective or weak for having a difficult time with everything. I know you just want to power through life, but your mind is begging you to slow down and address that pain. Pain demands to be felt. You're just human, and you need to move this hurt out of your body.  


I am speaking from experience because I was that 19 year old who couldn't stop. I tried to live life AND carry all that pain, and all it amounted to was slamming into what I thought was rock-bottom, then falling further. After two suicide attempts and retraumatization in college, I was given the choice of hospitalization or telling my parents. I ended up hospitalized *and* telling my parents, which meant living with my abusers for a year. Hell, right now I'm still trying to do school even though this quarantine brought me back to where the trauma all began. I'm having an impossible time dropping out or reaching out for help. I get it. You want to be functional and not give the trauma/your abusers power. It feels like you can't stop. But I beg you to stop before you're forced to. The way you're living isn't sustainable, and something has to give. That something may have to be you."

This makes me pretty angry, tbh. That tech wasn't for you at all, it was just a way they thought they could keep tabs on you. They are tracking devices they wanted you to want, so they wouldn't seem like assholes for stalking you.

I hope you continue your no-tech lifestyle. And I'm sorry your parents, who should be selfless and loving, are they way that they are. You rock, and I'm really impressed with your lifestyle choices.  
If they don't get you a gift, I will lol."

I'm sorry you're going through this. Losing your memory to such a degree makes you feel crazy and disoriented. I'm sorry. It sounds like you have it really really bad. 

Being young and having this is a whole other set of shittiness. I'm young too. Are you part of cPTSD? It is a nice community with young people."

But thank you for posting. It is nice to know that someone is there with me. Check out r/Dissociation or r/DissociationToolbox, if you haven't already."
TooAfraidToAsk,fmgu0te,t3_fv4t94,1586057808.0,This sounds a bit like maladaptive daydreaming or dissociation. I would go see a professional. Good luck to you.
