She also has some interviews on youtube, and an in depth one with Collective Evolution/CEtv (I dont resonate a lot with their other content, but this is a really important interview imo).

Saw some really messed up stuff when he sang and I said he had to leave or I would leave. Anyway, I never saw him again, but I left that group for obvious reasons. I am okay to speak more if you would like to PM me."
Ayahuasca,flljmyf,t1_flk5ur8,1585261634.0,This is such a good answer!
Ayahuasca,flljgkh,t3_fpbw8f,1585261531.0,"Yeah I have had 2 clairvoyant people tell me similar things. One of them I actually saw  for a massage but somehow she skipped that and went right into stuff about my 'path'. Paid a lot of money and got no massage lol. As a rule I don't usually see people like that, especially after my first experience, but because my most recent experience was so triggering for my ptsd I ended up talking with two more 'clairvoyant' people, and those experiences actually really helped me. The person I spoke with most recently started our session off saying that what is said to us in a reading should never ever be used to replace our own truth and our own understanding and intuitions. She said to always stick with what feels true to us and if something doesn't seem true or doesn't align with us, then to leave it. She was great and it was a really balanced experience. I will contact her again one day for a session.

I don't know where your person was coming from, maybe they were coming from a legitimate place, but what I noticed with the two clairvoyants who were guiding me away from Ayahuasca was that they seemed intimated by it, and also they were telling me things in a way where my own truth was not being honoured, there was a huge power imbalance. The last one was really intense, and she was trying to explain things to me that I already had a lot of experience in, but I couldn't get a word in to explain how much I had experienced. She was also explaining things like she knew for sure these were facts when she had never done Ayahuasca or been to the jungle or sat in a ceremony or anything. While I do not know a lot, obviously, I definitely did have more experience than her with this subject after 4+ years of on and off work with the medicine.

I know people who ended up messed up from Ayahuasca too. It is so important to do Ayahuasca with people you trust, and that can be hard to find. I thought I had found trust worthy people but I hadn't, and it was a roller coaster for sure. If you want to do it, do a lot of research, dig really, deep. Ask about retreats here and other forums, and don't just go off of trip advisor because it is really easy to fake reviews and delete negative ones. Even though I had some difficult and traumatic times with the first group I was involved with, I was able to find better people, and ultimately Ayahuasca really really saved me.

My sense too is that some psychics/energy workers are pretty intimidated by something that has a long lineage of tradition. If you find a good shaman/curandero to work with, you will see the difference those years of dedication and dietas make. Clairvoyants might pick up on stuff and think they are helping, but they don't always pick up accurate information and they don't always have deep training to be able to help them know what is right and what is not.

If you want you can always get a second opinion or you can take time to really check in with yourself about it too."

What makes it harder is that basically every single person around me minimized it also. 

TW 

Rose McGowan talks about being raped by Harvey Weinstein and as far as I can remember he didn't literally penetrate her either, and everyone including her has described her experince as rape. I am not sure if that is validating but it came to mind.

Sending safe hugs."
ptsd,fj4fyb5,t3_fbg6xm,1583007357.0,"Yeah I feel like I have some of this. In general I just feel really really bad for my abuser... and I think a lot of that comes from a valid place and a lot of it also comes from a place of unhealthy stuff. I am realizing too thought that I over empathize with people who hurt me. I am seeing that more clearly now. I empathize with them and don't empathize with myself at all and it is extremely unhealthy. I feel true anger is incredibly clearing, and only now am I beginning to feel rage, after years. Another thing too is that I didn't feel safe to feel angry, I think that played into it a lot."

In any case people here are really nice and it definitely has a way better vibe than most places I have been to in Ontario and Quebec. People aren't like glaring at you or constantly trying to run you over with their car, it's nice lol. I feel like no one really talks about the east coast much, when I was growing up other places in Canada were like, BC and the rockies. Every one would say there is nothing in the prairies, but I just didn't hear about the east coast at all. This sounds so bad and I am sorry, but growing up I guess I figured that because Canada has such a low population density in comparison to it's size that meant that mathematically not many people lived on the east coast or other places. There really isn't very much education out there though and in general I feel like I was never really taught about the different places in Canada, but I would learn about other places in the world and the USA instead. Now that I live here it's a bummer because it really is a great place on so many levels."

Psychic,fit47v2,t1_fit3o53,1582703747.0,"Wow that is terrible! Yeah like I find there is a lot of ego stuff that‚Äôs unresolved. Unconsciously I feel many people in these positions are getting a rush or high from being in a position of perceived knowledge and power, I feel I played into that with her too, just on the receiving end of it. I don‚Äôt feel she is a bad person at all, but that is an addictive dynamic for both parties. Like no judgment there at all because we can all end up in that even when we are doing great work too. Even if she was off I‚Äôm grateful because it really made me stop and consider why I‚Äôm making the choices I‚Äôm making. So even if it‚Äôs intense I did get a lot out of it and I‚Äôm grateful to get off the trauma cycle because that cycle included needing to travel in order to be safe from extreme abuse at home. I‚Äôm not in that anymore so there isn‚Äôt a reason to be taking such big trips. I‚Äôm just hoping I can be less triggered in general."
Psychic,fit3b1z,t1_fit35ew,1582702658.0,"Thank you so much. I feel like her explanation too is because I‚Äôve already been through intense trauma my soul is planning to go through more to learn even more... like a loop system. That was weird, she meant it in a general sense not just for my soul also. Like on one hand it was really positive but on the other hand it wasn‚Äôt and it felt kind of disrespectful."
Psychic,fit2r78,t1_fit0p97,1582701998.0,Thank you. Honestly I don‚Äôt know as I have never done this before... I do wish she was more respectful though. Like suggesting human trafficking after I shared I had been through trauma closely connected to human trafficking is intense. I can also see how I don‚Äôt need to go to South America and I was going for the wrong reasons and that can create it‚Äôs own cycle. I am reaching out to some others about this too.
Psychic,fit2gim,t1_fit2dln,1582701650.0,Yeah I can see that. I think! I hope I can go back one day though lol!
Psychic,fit1z0h,t1_fit0yne,1582701080.0,Yea I can see that ! Thank you so much! I decided I‚Äôm not going to go because I‚Äôm so shaken up but also because I‚Äôve had a lot go on and I need to chill and not travel. Thank you so much again.
Psychic,fiss2r6,t1_fisrya4,1582691794.0,Thank you so much! Yeah it left me feeling really shaken being told the ways I choose to live my life and help myself could lead to more extreme trauma lol. Thank you and good luck to you too!
Psychic,fispqjl,t1_fiso7ej,1582690087.0,"Thank you so much, this is so helpful! Like on one hand she was like there is no bad or good for the soul so these experiences would be extra expansion for your soul, but honestly no one wants to go through that so that isn't an option. She said we can get addicted to soul expansion which does't really make sense to me. Yeah she said I could go back in a few years and it would be okay. It is weird because she was like go anywhere else but this specific country, and I was like ok... but it's just weird af to have someone be like hey if you make this choice the universe is going to accelerate your expansion so that you will have something so traumatic happen that you will become a drug addict in prison for a while. 

She did say she sees us working more together... and at the time I was like okay and booked another appointment bc that is how I am lol but I can always cancel.   
It is frustrating to hear this after like honestly going through so much traumatic shit and NOT getting addicted to drugs or developing psychosis. Even if it was with the best of intentions on her part 100% there was a lot of triggering shit I have to work through now from talking with her. Like I am just super triggered bc my abuser used to say things like this too... so considering that I probably shouldn't be dabbling in this stuff at all.   


I did see an 'energy healer' a few years ago who was highly recommended but honestly she was pretty messed up. 

I might get another opinion but in general I am just going to stick with Eckhart Tolle and Jesus for now. I feel like that is the direction I prefer to take."
Psychic,fismxh6,t1_fislltw,1582688153.0,Thanks so much. Yeah it was hard bc I have a lot of trauma already so any suggestion of more is a lot to hear... like maybe it‚Äôs what I need to hear but also it didn‚Äôt seem like she understood where I was coming from and it was one of those things where there was some equality and respect but also the assumption that she knew more than me about certain things.
Psychic,fislj7g,t1_fislh3h,1582687245.0,"No, not at all."
Psychic,fisli82,t1_fislemc,1582687228.0,Thanks I am doing that.... yeah I dunno I spoke with my friend and he said readers shouldn't be saying things like that.
AmItheAsshole,finw991,t3_f8pj8i,1582571442.0,"NTA. People like that are going to take advantage of anyone they can. It's really sad but that is how it is. I am so sorry these are your friends. I am also grateful you have posted this because it's made me realize how messed up it has been that people have expected similar things from me, it's really not okay. To be upfront I have been friends with similar people, honestly even if you had just a bit more money than them they would probably still be trying to take advantage of you. My parents are not millionaires at all, they just have well paying jobs, and I personally have very little money. Because my parents are kind and because I have been through a lot of messed up stuff they have been supporting me financially lately. I live modestly, but this has still caused similar conflicts in my life with now former friends. You deserve so much better and I hope you can find friends who respect you and see you as a human being instead of a recourse to exploit. Everyone has given great replies and I hope this can give you the validation and self respect and love to cut these people out of your life and move on. Good luck!!"
