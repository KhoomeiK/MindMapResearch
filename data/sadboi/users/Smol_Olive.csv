After a shower, I'll have a bowl of ice cream, eat some fast food, or even go for a drive. After the rewards became routine, I challenged myself to shower twice a week, and then every other day. It was not easy, but honestly, I would try to remind myself how much better I would feel after I take a shower. After showers I feel so good and calm, idk I hope this kind of helps."

I didn't know how it worked, I just knew it wasn't through kissing because my parents kissed all the time. As I got older, like 11, I kinda put two and two together and assumed the pee-pee went into a girl's hole though I didn't know there were like 3 different holes. 

My first time wasn't like the movies at all but it was a good experience, we were super comfortable with each other but very awkward(we were both 17). It was with my first real ""love"" so losing our virginity together was something we wanted to do. We didn't really know what to do like if I'm being honest I kinda just got on top and like scooted(?) very slowly because it hurt a lot. I had seen porn before but god damn no experience made it really hard to do. After about two times we got the hang of it."

mentalhealth,fkbzha0,t3_fhiojp,1584042846.0,"Yep, Remeron worked wonders for me. I've tried it all Cymbalta, Lexapro, Prozac, etc. I was 75 pounds (I'm a 5'4"" female and I was 16 at the time) when I was put on Remeron and I got up to about 100 pounds in two months which was awesome for me. I had never crossed the 100-pound mark because it was really hard for me to eat, but Remeron gave me a huge appetite. I also had really bad insomnia, but Remeron would knock me out in 30 minutes. And of course, it helped with my moods, motivation, and overall quality of life. 

I will say the only downside was getting off Remeron. I knew it was time for me to get off because I was starting to feel numb (I had been on Remeron for about 3 years), not bad numb more just annoying numb. I also hadn't had a depressive episode in a year. I got off and my appetite is gone and it's hard for me to fall asleep, but that's only because I relied waaaaaay too much on Remeron. I've been off of it for about 2 months now and I'm slowly but surely working on my appetite and I'm taking melatonin and working out to help fall asleep quicker.

Honestly though, try to find a good psychiatrist who tries to find out what works for you and be prepared for side effects. Don't get discouraged when a couple of medications don't work for you. I hope things work out for you :)"
