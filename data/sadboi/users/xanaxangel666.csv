WritingPrompts,ewgz0c1,t3_cirlfc,1565393751.0,"Must I be alone to deal with the constant pain?
Bust through my mental walls, seemingly trying to attack

Gusts of sadness constantly blowing over me
Dust coated with unwanted thoughts hitting me in the face

Trust is broken, all of it is lost
Disgust fills all other human's faces as they see me

Lust is unknown, I have no desires
[I must've] Grown into someone who not one wants 

(this is pretty terrible ngl lmao, it's so hard to do this)"

mentalhealth,erbi1ri,t3_c170q9,1560681269.0,"I think it's good that you are aware that you might need a therapist. If you do have BPD, it would be better to catch it now rather than later, so you can steadily get the help you need. Good luck though ! Try your best, and do what you truly feels right"

WritingPrompts,erba89c,t3_c16zd0,1560668757.0,"""Who are you?"" I asked, an eerie feeling crawling up my spine. How could this stranger possibly have the same list as I do? That's completely out of order! That simply cannot be possible...

""My name is Christina Black."" At her response, my jaw dropped. What the actual hell is going on? How is this possible in any situation? ""M-My name is Christopher White."" A confused look came upon her face, in which I explained what I was really scared about. ""Your name is Christina, while mine is Christopher. Your last name is Black, while mine is White. It's like... you have the female version of my name... and the opposite of my last name."" To my explanation, her jaw dropped as well. 

Quickly, we had exchanged numbers, and now, a few days later, we decided go to a psychiatrist. Why? I don't know. I unconsciously suggested it and we agreed. So, here we were, explaining what happened. 

""I actually know quite a lot about these situations. You two are the opposite of each other, yet do things the same exact way. You both are stuck with the same mindset, and opinions, and interests. The only difference is, you two are physical opposites. A few examples would be Christina has blond hair while you have brown, Christopher. You,"" he points to Christina, ""have blue eyes, while he has brown. And you,"" he points to me, ""are 6'4 while Christina is 5'4."" 

Turns out, we all have physical opposites but act the exact same way. It's just, apparently rare to meet them... and mind-blowingly, I did."
