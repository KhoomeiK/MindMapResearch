If you just buckled down 4-5hrs, you  could get everything done in half the time. It Amazes me how much time people waste during the work day and then complain About “9-5”. Luckily, at least with skilled jobs, companies are starting to realize that it doesn’t matter how long you work, just get your work done. I’m not trying to compete with anyone here, but 9-5 isn’t that bad at all unless you HATE your job. Thats  the only time it becomes miserable. Granted, the time off in the US is still shit."

If that’s your thing, then be prepared to deal with the eccentricities of a creep who wants to date someone your age at his age. 

I’m sure deep down you know and many of your friends probably told you it was irresponsible, weird, gross, and dangerous to go on a date with someone his age at your age. 

But you didn’t listen, the inevitable happened, and now you’re on here acting surprised. It sucks, but take some responsibility for your own poor judgment.

If you want to date a healthy person, at least keep it to 10 years less in age gap. I’m 27 and even I would feel a bit like a creep asking you out. Again, not my kink, maybe it’s yours,  no judgement,  but your should know better if you expected more."
