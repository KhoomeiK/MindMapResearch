My INFJ mom and I are really good at history because of our Ni— history reads like Ni! 

For example, WW2 and the current mideastern conflict is an example of Ni. Both conflicts started because of a power imbalance and the person at top punished the person at the bottom. In WW2 it was caused by revenge on the allies end and modern mideastern conflict was caused by greed from the US.  Both conflicts have very different details but the underlying issue is still there. 

History is full of underlying, repeating problems we refuse to acknowledge. It involves admitting we are pretty terrible, selfish, and violent as a species. Working on correcting our nature also involves effort very few want to put in. People would rather live in lies because it is easier. 

Sorry for my tangent! But in summery, read socionics take on Ni.
