My600lbLife,fjj2ld8,t1_fjhi09l,1583381649.0,"SSDI and SSI are 2 completely different programs. SSDI is based on your highest earnings. SSI is more like welfare disability. You don't need the work credits. And SSI is only 733$ a month or somewhere around there. SSDI is also capped at around 2k a month. But average is 1500$ a month. SSDI does give the offspring of the disabled person but, it's not that much. And let's say the amount is 450 a month and you have 3 kids...they divide the 450 3 ways for each child. So, it's not as kick ass as people want to think. I was denied twice. I got a lawyer and finally got it. They are pretty behind in applications so that's why it takes like 3 years to be approved. It took me a year and a half back in 2003. You also have to be out of work do to the disability for a year before you can even apply. So, it's not as glamorous as people think."
AskDocs,fj7dl5q,t3_fbp7fi,1583090092.0,I had my gallbladder out when I was 17. My daughter had hers removed at 15. The pain is unimaginable. Like fetal position pain. Giving birth was tons easier. I had complained of severe pain for months. They finally did a ultrasound and that's how they decided to remove it. My daughter didn't have to suffer as long as I did because we just had them look at her gallbladder when she started having the severe pain. Eating anything with high fat in it gave me unbelievable diarrhea for a few years after it was removed. I'm now 48 and haven't had any problems with it being gone. I've had ulcers for awhile tho. Not sure if it has anything to do with my gallbladder being removed. I hope you can figure it out soon.

loveafterlockup,fhu7q7k,t3_f4q4om,1581882969.0,"I'm a foster child who was adopted by my foster parents. I was placed when I was an infant. My birth mother's rights from what I understand took forever. I was taken away from her at lease once then given back till ultimately her rights were terminated. But, I wasn't formally adopted till I was 11. My adopted mom was way abusive. I've tried to locate my birth mom off and on since I was around 19. The adoption was sealed meaning neither my bio mother nor my adopted parents could have access to the files. California (where I was born) is a closed adoption state so the only info I can get is my non identifying information about my bio parents. So, it's a bitch to find out either way. I don't think she has a chance in hell of making contact. She'll be lucky if they don't take the new baby from her. Unless her adopted out children want to find her once they are 18 they'll have an uphill battle. And they probably have a ton of issues towards her not being a decent parent to them. Being adopted is a very weird thing. At least for me. But, my adopted mother was crazy and abusive. And if her children have had a good life with their adopted family they may never want to meet her. It's possible that the kids adopted parents have been truthful about their birth could also be a hindrance for them not wanting to deal with her. Sorry for the wall of text. I'm on my phone."

They may have worked together but, I highly doubt she had as close of a relationship with him. I found the book totally self serving as it's mostly about her bragging about what buddies she was with him. There are way more books that are more insightful than her book. She doesn't even go into the fact that he'd go back to the bodies to have sex with them and make them ""pretty"" by putting make up on them."
serialkillers,fcnccgj,t3_eht3bd,1577808644.0,"His mother made him totally afraid of girls. She drove into him that no girl would ever give him the time of day. He wouldn't kill a girl if they chatted him up when he picked them up. He was painfully she around girls. Take for instance the fact he couldn't stab a girl in her chest because her boobs were all right there. And he apologized for brush up against her boob. Similar to Bundy he liked to have sex when they had already died. I think it was due impart of him feeling he was inadequate with girls. The fact tho is he killed his grandparents way before he started killing the girls. So, he already was leaning into murder. I think he is a classic case of his mother driving into him that he'd never be with a girl. So it's is nature vs nurture with him. If he had a loving mom from the get go, I think he could of been a normal person. He knows he's fucked up. Which is why he knows he'll never get out of jail. But, I think if he did I don't think he'd kill again. I'm sure after all these years he's had some therapy. He's been held in a hospital setting all this time. I just find him so fascinating.

He got out of the mental institute because he aced the test to prove he was ""sane"". He knew what to say to get out. I do agree that if he off'ed dear ol' ma first that would have saved the girls lives. He's a brilliant man but, recognized that he was fucked in the head. So, he's the only SK who turned themselves in before they were even close to solving the murders. He has the most insight into his killing than any other SK. Bundy just tried to give insight to his behavior as a means to get out of his execution. I've always found Kemper so interesting because all that. I wrote to him once but, I found out latter he stopped writing people before I wrote him. He's the only SK I've ever wrote to."
