I feel like by the time Obi Wan wraps up and we get to season 2 - 3 of Mandalorian that the fanbase will be both ready for and desiring of a classic original Star Wars storyline. It would also put enough time between the Solo movie flop and then that the fans wouldn't be put off by either just revisiting Han Solo or seeing him and Chewie in animation form. 

I kind of see this entire massive push by Disney with the new trilogy and extended new canon as the death star plans in the end scene of *Rogue One*, ""What is it they've sent us?"" to which Leia responds...""Hope."" The newest trilogy, with all it's flaws, feels like a lot of hope for many years of new Star Wars content to come.

I don't think it's healthy lol. But anyways, being creative, doing my art, petting/loving my dog, talking about it with my partner, gardening, being in the woods, and having classical music playing seem to help me a lot keeping the intrusive thoughts down. The classical music for some reason just takes the usual mental turmoil and brings it down to level 2 from a 10. It's calming, moving, beautiful....I am inspired by natural beauty of the world, or beautiful things like classical music, and inspiration is one of the few states of mind where I don't get intrusive thoughts.

She was turtle mountain chippewa and southern cheyenne, she was born in a real nomadic warrior society and lived that life as a young girl until the whites massacred her village, then they moved onto a designated 'peaceful' spot (designated by white U.S.) in the plains region. They were disarmed, then the cavalry came in and murdered all the men, raped the women and children (boys and girls) then bashed their heads in with the butts of their rifles. They then carved out the nutsacks and vaginas to keep as dried or leather war trophies, ears, eyes, and scalps too. Grandpas grandma was hiding in the tall grass, and watched it happen.

So when people try to tell me ""OHHH IT WAS HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO GET OVER IT"" I get enraged, and I have come to have a very poor outlook about non-natives since in my experience they are mostly full of colonizer brain washing and see me and all natives as a race which should have died off or accepted the 'American Way' fully.

And the thing is that this colonizer treatment hasn't stopped. I think standing rock was a big wake up call for all tribes that we are still second, if not third class citizens. Anyways, rant over."
Starwarscommander,fi36j38,t1_fi1bt7r,1582103356.0,Honestly it's just the design of the game to get you to cave and buy stuff from the store. I have found that you have to check in on your base at least 4 times a day to get the resources builg up enough to upgrade. At least for me with level 9 headquarters.

CPTSD,fi35r8j,t3_f5ztam,1582102262.0,"I have struggled with this exact thing since I was about 13. I was sexually groomed and raped as a child before that, and I was trained I suppose to feel stupid and worthless all the time. I am actually quite good at acting the part of a confident & well spoken person. But the reality is afterwards I have major anxiety and sometimes panic attacks over hyperanalyzing every syllable I spoke in the company of other people and how I acted etc. I have major anxiety *when* I am acting the part as well. I used to get so bad that I would gag, puke, cry, and all of it involuntary. It was so embarassing, now I can hold the tears until I am alone and then I sob like a little bitch. After a decade or so of therapy now I just have all the symptoms of out of control ptsd, depression, and of course anxiety to such a degree that I sometimes slip in and out of disassociating or have psychotic spells. I'm also physically disabled with horrible pain and a leaky bladder due to spinal cord injury but hey that's life now please excuse me as I go check the price on neuse quality rope."

I won't say I'm good at pricing art, but what I do sell I try to remind myself that I should charge more than the cost of a dinner for two at the local McDonalds. You and your art are worth more than two quarter pounder meals and an ice cream."

I get that with every single thing I have ever created, I always get so fed up with it I have to hide it until my feelings subside and I can look at it from an unemotional perspective. But, after a lot of years of living in that artists angst I have come to realize that *that* is exactly what pushes the best artists; that need and true spiritual desire to pull from nothingness and create beauty, or sadness, or grandiousity, or anything really. But we never *quite* execute it how the minds eye saw it in that mystical place that is inspiration. We are doomed like mythical greek tragedies to roam this earth forever longing for perfection in our art and never being able to fully grasp it, hounded by the muses and scorned by the plebeian masses."
