I slowed down the replay further when a friend questioned it and you need to do it \*right\* before Malz ults since you need to knock him up to cancel his ultimate. Too slow and you don't cast your ult at all, too fast and you don't cancel his ult. I just got really lucky lol

In general, it's preferable to ult him before he ults you so that you at least get the damage off while he's stationary. I'll poke him down before going in and before then, I try to get a lead pre6 so that I can survive his ult damage. Probably best not to fight if you don't know where their jg is \^\^"

She should, theoretically, succumb to your combo. Also, you can potentially bait out her W R if you go in on her after she uses her W, but if she Q or E instead just ulti her.

I don't know all the symptoms you experience or how frequent or what their triggers are, but I can empathize with the obsessive behavior, feeling like you need to remove yourself from that person's life because you feel like you will explode if you stay any longer. It's painful. I'm currently in DBT (pre-committal) and on suicide watch... most borderline symptoms are pretty stark.

Try your best not to bring yourself down or blame yourself. You may have a condition that affects your judgment, but you can take the steps to manage it slowly and consistently (if bipolar, taking medication may help. In general, attending DBT courses, etc). Remember that you never asked for any of the mental afflictions you currently experience and that you do feel remorse for your actions. Utilize that to bring positive change into your life. Change like this will take time, so don't feel discouraged if you don't get immediate results (and please drop the expectation as soon as possible!). People make mistakes."

BPD,fe6q9nl,t1_fe6nsk5,1578900357.0,"It's good that he has faith that things will stay secure, even if one of you needed space. That's a big sign of trust. Yes, it really seems that he is trying to put the pieces together, most likely alongside his psych or therapist, to prevent situations such as accidentally hurting you due to his stress. I know he's glad to know, though, that you'll be there to walk alongside him.

Considering his ex is hurt, it would make sense that this would add on a lot of extra turmoil that he may not want to involve you in, to protect you. It may already be troubling for the child if they are in the middle of it. As you two have plans, all you need to do for now is sit tight and give him the patience he needs, as though he *went to war for you*, and will come home.

You can do different things to occupy yourself; a job, a hobby, working out, hanging out with friends. I know a lot of things can sound really hard to do when you have BPD, but if you find something works, even just a little thing like taking a walk in the morning, remember that it worked for you at some point, and you should be able to come back to it in the future if you need to.

You can try to find some QoL to make the household transition easier for him; learn recipes to cook for him, look for furniture or things he may want, but try not to buy anything or change anything yet unless it's a small thing. Write all your ideas down for later!  When he is ready to make the move, don't bombard him with these ideas until he is ready to discuss them. He already may have to move furniture, accessories, clothes into the house and hearing that you want him to do more could be overwhelming. He will surely want to relax once things are settled! If he never brings it up, and it's been a few weeks, you can ask him what he thinks. It probably never came to his mind, which happens a lot, especially when you've been busy for a while.

If you think not talking enough is strange, you can ask if he would be okay with also saying goodnight or good morning if that would reassure you. You may wake up at different times though, so don't worry if he doesn't respond fast enough. He also might forget to tell you goodnight and just pass out (had that happen many times for me!).

I think that's all I've got in me for now. Best of luck to you and your relationship!"
BPD,fe6l5vb,t1_fe6jv4w,1578894558.0,"Yeah, trying to explain my feelings and problems to most of my friends usually ends up in some kind of a slap in the face. I have no idea if it's intentional or not since people often go by the ""suck it up"" vibe, but unfortunately, it can be really hard to suck it up!

Do you use Discord, by chance? It's kind of like Skype but less ugly and originally for gamers haha. I don't really use Reddit hardly enough to even qualify myself as a Redditor."
BPD,fe6kpju,t3_enyg6j,1578894106.0,"It should be fine! If he is concerned about your feelings, wellbeing, texting you, he is making changes so that you two can BE together? That is amazing and I bet you must be thankful for that. Don't be afraid to give him some time. I'm sure, in any case, if you needed any time to process your thoughts and emotions,  you would appreciate it the same. I'm literally only 19, but I've had one hell of a 2018 and 2019 with my own relationship, and he is non-committal. I've had to deal with his need for distance and it's extremes rather frequently and it's torn me apart, but I also over time recognized that he always came back for me.

Now, we're not together anymore (I broke things off today, actually... still going through the waves with that; why I'm on r/BPD!) as I finally realized I deserved better, but, if he is truly making changes to progress with you, and HUGE life changes at that, he would most likely do much better without feeling as though he also needs to worry for you! It can be disheartening to know that your actions are potentially hurting another person, especially when they are unavoidable. Men do not really like to open up about their feelings and woes; they feel and then forget until it builds up and they break. If he is worried about the current choices he is making, that could be an issue. It might not be a good idea to ask him directly about it, though. Just make sure you can remind him that you are open to listening if he needs it! If you are certain, he should trust you! It could take a weight off his chest.

Him seeking solitude would have nothing to do with your worth, but more likely that these changes hit him hard; he has to work through child custody, a new mortgage, his ex-partner could also be going through a rough time, and if they are still friends, he may be holding her burden as well. He may be concerned about how his kids will handle the changes, how much he has to take care of in such a short time. It can be very hard to find time for a safe place of peace and quiet within a storm if there are extra things to worry about and take care of, like whether or not you left your phone in the rain. But, if you know your phone is always with you in your pocket, you don't have to worry so much =)

As I mentioned before, what helped me was recognizing patterns, consistency, and ""certain certainties"" as Anna from Frozen says. My ex always came back (even if it's as a friend), so I could rely on this and it put me at ease if he ever needed distance (or cut me off for a short time, heh). However... I do not know the specifics of your situation with him. You say he is only texting you every few days? Since he has a partner, is he going through a divorce? Does he live in the same house as you yet and you are just avoiding contact? These could help me understand a bit better the things you're feeling. =)"
BPD,fe6in0y,t3_enxind,1578892095.0,"Honestly, yeah. I feel depressed when they're about to leave, and then after they leave, I feel relieved lmaoo.

BPD,fe6i74t,t3_enx5h8,1578891685.0,"OK, mine did this to me literally right after he left my house and got home in Quebec a day later... I was shocked and broken, but he came back and he said he was drunk and wanted to make things right after that.

2 weeks later, today, I finally let him go because I swear he didn't really love me and that he had a deluded idea of love. Finally, I stood up for myself for once and told him he didn't deserve me, and he agreed!? I feel relieved and somehow finally accept it after *5* suicide attempts last year, 4 due to this relationship, but my heart's still broken nonetheless. I was diagnosed with BPD in January 2019 (after my 1st suicide attempt)... I'm only 19, but yeah, he strung me along, seemingly about to tear me down with more concern for himself, and didn't give me any hope for future commitment in the end. I'm finally returning to therapy in 2 days after skipping the whole summer and fall...

Like you, I'm excited to fall in love with myself, too! It'll take some time to heal, though... I think he'll still be in my heart for a long time. If you're interested, maybe we can chat occasionally to see how we're moving along in life? Regardless if we're 10 or 30 years difference of age, I feel our situations are similar enough. =)"
