2) the Use Your Illusion albums charting at #1 and #2


3) G'N'R's vibe / image (the good press and the bad) was already way more street / less silly (no neon gtrs)


4) big personalities - most rock fans (and Americans) know the band members by single names (Izzy, Axl, Slash, Duff)


5) their diverse influences and instrumental chops blended surprisingly well as a team, they turned out to be smart arrangers and what they do still rocks


6) Axl is an underrated lyricist and monster songwriter
