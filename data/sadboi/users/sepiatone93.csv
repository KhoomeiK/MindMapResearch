Kerala,fq86yr0,t1_fq6yscv,1589159761.0,"I see it like this - (assumption) No country (except for very small ones like Iceland / Malta / UAE) have been able to test people at will, i.e. random sampling. They test people if they're already showing the symptoms or if they've been in contact with someone who has tested positive. So this is again not really a ""high"" testing rate - it is the same as in Kerala - testing people who have a good chance of having COVID-19.

I suspect you're getting downvoted by folks who're taking your skepticism of the ""Kerala model"" as a personal affront :) And btw, I think the article is wrong about calling this strategy the ""Kerala model"". I think the Kerala model correctly means the strong public health setup in the state that has been around for decades, much longer than COVID-19."
Kerala,fq6wnau,t1_fq6lgn4,1589138795.0,"I'd started off thinking the same as you - a low level of testing -> no real idea as to how many folks are infected, but then after nearly 3 months of the first case shouldn't there be more people seriously sick in hospitals?

As the infographic shows after the lockdown phase testing becomes more important - to figure out those who are asymptomatic and can transmit the diesease. In the earlier lockdown phase it matters less since asympotmatic folks will not be able to transmit the disease easily.

Of course I hope that the testing ramps up by a lot now, though from this [graph](https://www.covid19india.org/state/KL), it appears to be about the same as during the lockdown (the lockdown was lifted on May 4th)"
