I started it again as a monotherapy in November when I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. I had no expectations of it helping my MDD. No psychotropics ever had. Suicide was the only plan I was invested in, clinical or otherwise. I had to wait to execute my plan and took bupropion in the mean time because I had paid for it and was chided to. I had no side effects and was still very depressed and suicidal. It didn‚Äôt start working until the 3 month mark. There was absolutely no detectable effect prior to that. It was seemingly sudden that in January I couldn‚Äôt drink my usual two cups of morning coffee in bed. I had too much energy. I had urges to exercise and dance. I wanted to be with people, engage with people.  I wasn‚Äôt crying all day and I didn‚Äôt think of 100 ways to kill myself every time I entered a room. My interest/curiosity returned and my cognition has been gradually improving. I can hold a conversation. 
Will this happen for all people who take bupropion? Hell nah. Psychiatry is such trial and error, psychotropics responding to our unique makeup and pathophysiology. I‚Äôve had devastating consequences from psychotropics. Such that I became very trepid and critical of pharmacological approaches. I‚Äôve been in psychotherapy and in and out of hospitals and basically disabled my entire life and nothing has been as helpful as finding an effective medication. I had to be pushed by others every step of the way though. I would not have arrived at not wanting to die on my own."
