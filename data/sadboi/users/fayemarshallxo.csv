BPD,fpxeuv8,t1_fpwtqr4,1588981327.0,You are NOT manipulative. My therapist told me our behaviour is not manipulative because we don’t have the insight or tools in that moment to know what we’re doing. It’s instinct. Manipulation requires calculation and forethought. We are not manipulative.

There are many ways FPs can show they’re all about you - but it often isn’t up to our extreme standards.  
I really don’t know how to mitigate that feeling apart from asking them over and over again “do you still love me?”, and the frustrating thing is, even if they don’t love you anymore; they’ll still say that they will.  
So you’ll truly never know, maybe that’s comforting, maybe it’s not. you just gotta have faith."

BPD,fiytdhw,t1_fiys5y6,1582846511.0,"I get that. But I feel like having someone who can “handle” it is VERY different to someone who can “put up with it”. 
My ex put up with it. He slugged through it and barely made it out alive.  

When I say handle it I mean: set boundaries, put in limits, communicate about why it happened, disagree but still have empathy, take appropriate action in crisis, thoroughly read up on the condition, set their own limits, showing no really means no, having their own space with no questions asked, comforting when it’s appropriate to comfort during a breakdown, not enabling suicidal ideation. 

I hope you see my point and the differences between someone just putting up and shutting up and someone really handling it and dealing with it effectively."
BPD,fiyokt6,t1_fiyo7vx,1582843531.0,"Yep same here. Currently undergoing DBT. Managing and self soothing. Only had 1 outburst of my BPD in the last 6 months which for me is good considering they used to be weekly or monthly.  
My point is, I’m going to have these outbursts at some point. I’m going to lose control now and again because I haven’t yet started another relationship since the therapy so I don’t *really* know how I’ll react. 
I definitely do not want a co-dependent partner. I want the opposite and someone who sets boundaries.  
My ex FP never set boundaries and always gave in and it was the main reason it ended so destructively and abruptly and got so bad.  
I just don’t ever want to hurt someone like that again. But I also need hope that there are men out there who can handle the bat shit crazy stuff when it gets bad."
BPD,fiykx68,t1_fiykjj3,1582841417.0,"Yeah, see I suffered extremely badly with the suicidal threats. Like I was doing it every single time he was off with me, or we argued, or he didn’t want to spend time with me, or something didn’t go right. Straight away instinctively, and almost reflexively, I’d be like “right well I’m just going to kill myself then”. Every damn time. It was like a compulsion that I couldn’t stop. And 80% of the time I actually felt that way too like I didn’t want to be alive because my FP wanted to spend time away from me. It was really insane. That was the crux of it where he was like “nope I can’t have this on my shoulders anymore it’s crushing me, goodbye.” And he’s never looked back since.  
But he also couldn’t deal with the fiery outbursts and the level it would get to of me screaming and shouting and crying and throwing things. Like an actual adult tantrum. I’m petrified of even getting close to anyone anymore because of how embarrassing and scary they are.  
You’ve got a great guy though and I’m sure you’ve got lots of amazing qualities and traits that make it all worth it."
BPD,fiykgqq,t1_fiy64at,1582841152.0,"100% agree. We have tendencies that can come across as abusive or manipulative, but that’s assuming we have the emotional intelligence, wit and tools in those situations to actively *act out* manipulation.  
We straight up don’t. The traits that seems abusive or manipulative aren’t ever done with malice or ill-intent I personally don’t believe, I think we act some of this stuff out without even realising what we’re doing till after it’s done."

BPD,fiyfiqf,t1_fiyc9pc,1582838414.0,"To correct myself a bit, he definitely did love me. But I think there wasn’t a really deep level of understanding there for him. Or patience. I get it was hard, but I don’t think he understood how hard it was living with it either every second of everyday. I just wish I could chat with him now about it, now I’m not in that BPD state and I’m extremely rational again.  
It’s just a shame he didn’t have the strength/passion/desire to really see it through with me, he knew BPD fades with him but I think his own life/goals/aspirations were always far more important to him deep down than I ever was. Again I can’t really be mad at that. Just upset lol."
BPD,fiy88qm,t1_fiy7wah,1582834461.0,"Yeah it explained a lot for me too but was also harrowing how long it went on, how obvious it was, and how not a single medical professional picked up on it. Despite being in and out of therapy for 8 years.  
I wish I’d have known sooner and salvaged my last relationship and had what was deserved.  
Maybe he was right for me though? And I just wasn’t right for him? I don’t think I can expect someone to stay with me through all of that mess. I can’t even blame him for leaving.  
I’m hurt he left but I understand why as it’s a lot to deal with. But I also think to myself if he truly loved me he would have stuck around or at least helped me through therapy. I know if it was the other way round I wouldn’t ever have left his side. I’d have supported him the entire way through.  
I find it hard to love myself without someone else loving me - after all the horrible things I’ve done to people I love I find it hard to believe I’m worthy of love from anyone. If I get compliments I just think “yeah well you don’t really know me & you haven’t seen my dark side yet”."
BPD,fiy5o3n,t1_fiy5cmh,1582833011.0,"I tried all that. I was consistently sorry after all arguments. I did everything I could to make it up to him. I got therapy, I did self-DBT, I went doctors countless times, tried to get myself sectioned, went to hospitals. I tried so so hard to change but I kept lashing out and becoming suicidal and taking his time and freedom away from him. He felt trapped.  
I was ALWAYS sorry and wanted to communicate but I didn’t even know I had BPD till the very end of the relationship after a near-miss suicide attempt that was the reason he left completely.  
He’d never go back to me now after how much I harassed him to take me back. I hounded him for weeks sending hundreds of messages a day. Thankfully I’m getting help now and I hope there is a man who stays after seeing the horrible ugly sides of me, If they ever show themselves.  
You’re very lucky. I wish my ex would have stuck with me it hurts a lot that he didn’t and it was “too much”.  I just don’t think he had it in him and I can’t blame him."

I’m currently receiving DBT at the moment and it’s definitely helping regulate my emotions. I’m just scared of having an outburst in my new relationships and hoping I find someone that will stick with me if I slip up or go into crisis mode. You’ve given me a bit of hope though so thank you."
BPD,fixq53l,t1_fixpwz4,1582824866.0,"I’m still trying to get my head around wether i was more of positive force than a negative force in my last relationship. But I feel having 2/3 arguments a week and 1 massive outburst every month was just too much for my ex. 
Towards the end I was suicidal every other week and he had enough of it and left.  
I’m starting to lose hope that I’ll ever find anyone who can handle it. I tried to take my life in front of him and he wouldn’t even hug me, he just rang the police because I’d hid the key somewhere so nobody left me alone :/"

And it really does. I’d love to see some digital stuff you produce. Both methods have tools and tricks where you can cheat. They both take talent and skill.

JordanPeterson,fijt7o2,t1_fijs6cd,1582463184.0,"People made the medium an issue. Saying it ain’t oil so it can’t be an oil painting. It can be an oil style painting if you’re using oil brushes, regardless of it being digital or physical. I’ve never had an issue with stating that before. 
I’m not tracing of painting OVER an original photo. I’m simply referencing an existing photo. Like every artist ever. This is common practice for people doing a photo referenced painting - many artists do this. Colour picking is also extremely common place for digital artist, any digital artist colour samples from reference images. There’s actually no digital artist that doesn’t do that to be honest which makes me question your knowledge around that medium. 
The reason the videos are close up is because I running a competition on my Instagram for people to win a free print if they guessed who i was drawing. I don’t see why I should have to PROVE my digital art? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.  
I haven’t traced and painted over ANY of my artwork. The price piece again was done by scratch and I did 2 pieces that are entirely different and they’re not even remotely similar in detail, colour or texture. Again, videos of the entire Prince painting process are on my TikTok profile. I’ll just take it as a compliment you think it’s that good that I MUST have cheated on the entire piece.  
The Claire Redfield piece was done solely on Procreate on my iPad. I can’t use procreate well and it’s the first time I’d ever used it with minimal tools/brushes. I stated that. Hence why it’s not as good as my professional photoshop pieces (obviously).  The MK took 30+ hours and was completely rendered to an inch of its life. I reworked it and reworked it and added immense detail. The Jordan piece was meant to be rough oil style painting with obvious strokes and no blending. So thanks for pointing out obvious and purposeful inconsistencies.  
I have nothing to hide about my art and I’m completely transparent with all of it. They all take extreme patience and I’m proud of every piece. Thanks :)"

JordanPeterson,fijjc8t,t1_fiigreh,1582450676.0,Haha okay. Try getting an image and using the oil painting filter it looks nothing like this. I’ve also uploaded a video of me painting it.
JordanPeterson,fijjb49,t1_fiiltrw,1582450632.0,"Yes I want to pursue it as a career. I’ve been honest about the entire process; it’s a study piece and I referenced an image of him like all artists do when painting someone. If that’s what’s meant by “from scratch” then that’s exactly what I did. I don’t see why it matters to people, it took me 3 days and it takes skill to look at a photo and paint it wether it’s physical or digital."
JordanPeterson,fijj7kh,t1_fiimyed,1582450498.0,You can have it on your wall! Prints are available in many sizes [here](https://fkart.bigcartel.com)
JordanPeterson,fijj6lx,t1_fiiqp7i,1582450461.0,I’m crediting myself haha.
JordanPeterson,fijj6b2,t1_fiisxp2,1582450450.0,Google the dimensions it’ll be able to show you better than I can explain it :) A3 is about half a size bigger.
JordanPeterson,fijj5j0,t1_fiitinm,1582450419.0,Thanks bucko!
JordanPeterson,fijj59e,t1_fiiy1jt,1582450408.0,Awesome thank you :)
JordanPeterson,fijj4fg,t1_fiiu1d6,1582450379.0,You realise that every single digital artist uses this process to sample colours and uses reference pallets? I really don’t see why digital artists get so much hate its absolutely ridiculous. I also have physical art all over my Instagram so it’s not like I don’t have the skill there anyway...
JordanPeterson,fijj2mb,t1_fiiya81,1582450311.0,"I have an entire TikTok page dedicated to my art showing the video process of everything I do and showing it from scratch. I deal with comments like yours everyday, even from my own family doubting myself skill, and I just take it as a compliment because I know myself that I haven’t traced the entire photo and I painted every single detail myself - so these comments don’t bother me. My Instagram also has all my physical art on there too. I guess it’s the plight of the digital artist 🤷🏻‍♀️"
JordanPeterson,fijiyhp,t1_fiizxag,1582450154.0,The think is i can paint. I have paintings on my Instagram. I do physical and digital art. I uploaded a video also proving that I didn’t trace it and painted it from scratch. Some people just can’t let people have their moment unfortunately. Have a good day 👍🏻
JordanPeterson,fijiwil,t1_fij09il,1582450078.0,Nice one Bucko! Might do Shelby next.
JordanPeterson,fijiw8e,t1_fij14us,1582450066.0,Thank you! :)
JordanPeterson,fijivt4,t1_fij2mxd,1582450051.0,Haha aw thanks bucko! 🤪
JordanPeterson,fijivc6,t1_fij6s1h,1582450033.0,Thank you!! And I did - just yesterday! Have a good day bucko :)
JordanPeterson,fijiuqg,t1_fij9nb8,1582450011.0,Thanks bucko ☺️
JordanPeterson,fijiu55,t1_fijds63,1582449989.0,Awesome thanks!
JordanPeterson,fijitw6,t1_fijf8ro,1582449978.0,Yeah if people would want that! I do take custom requests
JordanPeterson,fijit7c,t1_fijfr7c,1582449953.0,Yes :) it wouldn’t let me edit the title I was meant to say “oil-style” painting I got excited lol
JordanPeterson,fijisaj,t1_fijhj14,1582449919.0,And again if you’d read the comments properly - I posted this in a hurry as I was super excited to get it out there and it wouldn’t let me edit the title so I disclosed it in the comments. There’s literally nothing I can do. I credited my art page which makes it clear I’m a digital artist. And my website also states that too. There’s literally nothing else I can do and I think both take extreme skill anyway and I don’t see how it would be misleading in terms of talent. If I could edit the title I would but I cannot.
JordanPeterson,fiie8hd,t1_fiidjcd,1582420393.0,It honestly doesn’t take long to get good! Get a Wacom tablet and get going :)
JordanPeterson,fiie4g9,t1_fiidxhw,1582420348.0,But it is an oil painting. I used oil brushes and oil style paint. It looks just like an oil painting. It’s an oil based technique.  Is it really an issue? Anyone with a brain cell and a pair of eyes can see its digital.
