A customer came up to my register yesterday covered in his own blood and I had a panic attack and had to run to the back of the store after ringing him up all while oblivious customers kept hounding me for hand sanitizer and toilet paper.

We need a greater societal push for better working conditions and pay for retail workers, and just better treatment from the public overall.

I know they're not a popular animal, but that doesn't mean they deserve to be *tortured to death* just for existing the way nature intended. Killing them is one thing, and sometimes very necessary, but torturing is completely different.

People absolutely **do not** know how to follow the most basic instructions when paying with their cards. Our card readers are simple: you press 'yes' to say you are ready to pay, you insert your card, then you either enter your PIN if it's debit, or sign if it's credit. And if you're using debit, you'll get a screen popping up if you want cash back.

99% of people can't figure this shit out. I get it that some features aren't terribly obvious, like pressing the green button/enter if you want to run your card as credit and it defaults to debit, but almost all of the issues these people have would be solved by *reading the screen*.

People get really aggressive over the cash back thing, too. So many people actually scream at me and panic because they don't want cash back. And every godsdamned time I have to tell them with a straight face to just press ""no.""

One time, our registers weren't working when it came to the cash back feature, and our IT department was working on finding out the cause.

I told him outright, ""look, this thing is going to hit all of us whether it comes from her or not. I need to know if there's a plan for handling this."" He told me that the plan was to send people home if they came in sick (although that clearly wasn't the case with this girl).

I asked if there was anything that was going to be done for those of us who didn't have sick days. The really screwed up thing is that my store changed its sick day policy in January, and that policy change left a lot of people without sick days for the remainder of the year because flu season hit us hard in that month, and our sick days renewed. Most of us would have only used one day or would have not used any and saved them for when this reached the states, but our HR lady filled out the sick day forms automatically for us. It used to be that we could choose when to use them.

Imagine getting sick a week after your 3 sick days for *the entire year* renew, and losing all of them, and not having any say as to whether you wanted to use them later or not. Hell, my fast food job was more reasonable than that!

I reminded this manager that a lot of us can't afford to just not work for an unknown period of time. As it stands, I have $1.53 in my bank account right now, for the remainder of the week, because getting sick last month put me $300 behind on rent, and I got saddled with a $75 late fee on top of it. I had to put nearly every cent of my last paycheck into that. One more financial hit, and I myself could end up on the streets.

I told him that, and he just laughed at me and proceeded to mock me for the entire day. There was a mail delivery at one point and he came up to me with a package and said, ""hey IdRatherBeADrow, it's for you! It's from the coronavirus.""

I wish desperately that I could afford to quit this job, because it's absolutely insufferable between the abuse and the moral issues (we're basically snake oil peddlers. I heard my store owner cackling with glee when we broke our nightly record and going on about how he hoped coronavirus was here to stay. I'm all for being happy about profits, but the man's pure evil - and for many reasons I can't even say publicly)."

Hypervigilance isn't easy to let go of when you've had so many close calls.

My lack of interest in drinking doesn't come up terribly often outside of work. Usually, it's just customers asking me for wine recommendations and me redirecting them to someone more knowledgeable. I've definitely had a few people pry, and I just awkwardly told them that my reasons are my own. Not the best way of handling it.

AskReddit,fjn1ql8,t3_febbkk,1583494649.0,"Working in a health food store, you deal with a lot of crazy people. There's this one lady that would pull into our parking lot a half hour before close, sit in her car, and wait until the very last minute to come in. She'd load up on hundreds of dollars worth of items, insist that you couldn't scan any of them and that you had to type in the barcode for each time, and to top it off, she'd open the smelliest food she got and eat it at the register while talking nonstop about crazy shit, like how she's female Michael Jackson and she's filming a movie and going to get Jim Carry and Chris Rock to star in it, and how she's God's favorite and He told her so. Her entire diet was keto desserts and fermented garlic, so you can imagine how pleasant that was to deal with. She'd also stay in our parking lot long after we closed so she could harass the nutritionist as she went to her car.

Well, after dealing with this for two years, I finally had enough. See, she found out that I took the bus to work, and she started going out of her way to screw with me while I was trying to leave. She'd come up and ask me to help her find a made up product we didn't carry, and I'd have to walk her over to the place where said item would be if we carried it. Spoiler: we never did. And every single time, she'd go off on me about how I should really know my stock better, after all, I work there. It's amazing they let me work there when I don't know my store's products.

She pulled the same damn thing again, and that day had already been one of the worst days I'd ever had there. People were even worse than usual. I know you'd think that fast food customers would be the worst, but I got treated way better by them than I did (and still do) by most of the customers at the health food store.

Anyway, I was on my way out, and she gunned for me again, and I'd had enough. I went through the same song and dance with her, and at that point, I told her that from now on, she could ask someone else. She does this every time she comes in, and I'm tired of being talked down to by her.

She went absolutely ballistic. Went around the store saying all kinds of nasty things about me, referring to me as ""the big one,"" mocking me, calling me fat. Now, look: I'm no model. I'm a solid 6, maybe a 7 if I'm really feeling full of myself. But I'm not obese by any means. It's true I'm a bit overweight, but not terribly so. Enough that I'm making a point to workout more so that I don't become *truly* overweight, but nowhere near enough to be considered ""the big one.""

Even IF I were truly that big though, that's still no excuse for that type of behavior. I'd be pissed if she'd done it to anyone else, just on principle. And her nastiness didn't stop there, either: She wrote to HR pressuring them to fire me, followed me around the store the next time she came in trying to intimidate me (really didn't work; she's the least threatening looking person I have ever seen in my life, I'd feel more threatened by a cotton ball than her), and when none of that worked, she pulled the same crap on one of my coworkers."

I'm not crapping myself over the idea of the virus killing everyone on the planet, but what I *am* worried about is the financial impact for myself and other people in my boat. My roommate and I are already in danger of getting evicted because I got sick last month and had to miss several days of work, and our landlord isn't remotely merciful. If the rent check isn't there by noon on the very day rent is due, you get served a 3-day notice and slapped with a $75 late fee.

Then, when I was around 13-14, I started taking an interest in the older pagan religions. It didn't happen exactly like that, though; at the time, we were learning about ancient civilizations in school (Greece happened to be the topic for a few weeks), and my mom rented the movie ""Troy."" If you've seen it, you'll know the gods are absent aside from a few remarks made from some of the characters here and there. But the gods themselves never show up. I really took an interest in some of the characters, like Odysseus, Hector, and Achilles, so when we began learning about them in class, that led me into doing a whole lot of independent research and eventually finding out that people worshiped these heroes in addition to worshiping the gods.

My parents weren't thrilled or remotely supportive when I took an interest in Hellenic paganism. Both of them tried to steer me away from it and said some pretty nasty things about it. On my dad's side, he twisted around everything I said when I mentioned that I was studying Greek history and religion, and told my mom some pretty wild shit. On my mom's side, she told me I was worshiping evil people. Things didn't get any better for me a few years later when I joined a pagan community that had some really vile people leading it. I went through a lot of abuse and left the pagan community altogether for a while.

Now, I've gone in a very different direction. For the past 13 years, I've been a Hellenic polytheist more or less (not strictly recon by any means, but I did my homework), but the Norse gods started calling out to me about 7 years ago, and one year ago, I finally gave in and sought them out. I'm a lot better off for it; while I don't consider myself a Hellenic Polytheist anymore, I haven't completely cut the Theoi or the heroes off. I look at it more like leaving the nest, but still keeping contact with the folks. The Norse gods have been great to me, and even before I gave in and committed to them, one of them in particular helped me out of some seriously rough spots in my life. They've earned my loyalty.

Ironically, my mom's now firmly atheist to the point of being intolerant at times. My dad flip-flops constantly."
