Because who gives you the right to rob someone of something so special?

I don’t think that way anymore because it would be extremely problematic if actually
put into action. Although, I do wish that all people like this that put others lives at risk would just .... disintegrate away somehow"

Donald Trump has done things that should have gotten him impeached, but the right just turns their head or maybe doesn’t even care to begin with. 
I didn’t pay much attention to Obama’s presidency considering I was under 18, but I can say with certainty that if Obama did half the bullshit that Trump has done, he would have been out of office sooooooo fast."
