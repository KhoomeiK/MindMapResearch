The only reason I joined this sub and looked into what an Empath was, was because I had been told by several people that I was an Empath, and I had no idea why."
Empaths,fprckp9,t1_fpqsjv0,1588850232.0,Lmao its easier to play along than it is to argue against. They‚Äôll do the dirty work of making themselves look a certain way. But he did make a fair point. Diversity is essential. It just wasn‚Äôt a point that needed to be made In response to my main question. I think he just wanted to make a point. And that‚Äôs okay. Sometimes people just want to make points.

Empaths,fpnrw5e,t1_fpnr5o5,1588771242.0,You‚Äôre asking me to think about something greater than myself. Why am I focused on how I receive empathy when diversity is a much important subject?

Never could wear a strapless bra or dress without thinking they looked too droopy. I think eventually it‚Äôs just a matter of accepting for what it is.

I also work in the healthcare field. I think it‚Äôs considered healthcare? I work with individuals on the autism spectrum that are around my age (20-23). It‚Äôs amazing how well I can understand their needs at times. Especially the non-verbal ones. It‚Äôs like I can test myself to truly see whether or not I‚Äôm an Empath. Ya know? Like I can tell what they need and they done even need to to say it because well.. they can‚Äôt. Idk. These people are so much more capable than we give them credit for sometimes. 

I understand what you mean. You feel the energy of everything around you. It can be so heavy. You know sometimes all too well. It can we so overwhelming. Not in a selfish way. But in an empathetic way. In a way where you want to help because you want their pain to stop hurting them because you know how it‚Äôs hurt you before, maybe? Idk."

Advice,fke0inf,t3_fhtd5y,1584101784.0,"This sounds like anxiety. The thing about anxiety, that I feel makes it sounds silly but also gives it a lot truth, is that it IS in your head. I‚Äôve suffered from an anxiety disorder my entire life and it‚Äôs not an easy thing to deal with. I have Tourette‚Äôs as well, so believe me, when something is working for my anxiety, I can see the difference! Haha. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre experiencing this right now though. 

There is help! Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a great option if you wish to seek treatment. 

If you need something a little more convenient, there are thousands of mindfulness mediation apps, and other mindfulness based resources. Practicing mindfulness has worked WONDERS for my anxiety. Simple going around the room and naming 5 things you can see, 4 things you can hear, 3 things you can feel (touch); is 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste is a great grounding exercise to help you feel more aware of yourself and your surrounding when you feel anxious. 

Walking, doodling, driving (my personal favorite) whatever helps your thoughts move along an even enough pace so that you can focus your nervous energy for a moment, can be considered meditation. It doesn‚Äôt have to be sitting down. 

The idea isn‚Äôt so much to help in just the small times at the supermarket but as a whole! So during those times you feel more at ease. It‚Äôs something you practice, to live a more mindful life that will have you feeling more at ease, more of the time. It‚Äôs teaching your brain to think, more than it is teaching yourself to deal with specific situations. So it WILL take time, but the mor you practice, the easier it will get. Like riding a bike. 

I hope this helps a little!"

That being said, I agree that perhaps Cognitive Behavioral Therapy may be beneficial. A Cognitive Behavior Therapist may refer you to a psychiatrist if necessary. 

One thing that I tried that helped me tremendously, was making sure I did one thing, the same thing, everyday, so no matter what, at least I can say THIS thing was accomplished. I made that thing making my bed. And no matter what time of the day, morning evening or night, my bed was always made. And everyday, my bed is made, and for whatever reason, it really helped me along my way. Maybe give that a shot?"
