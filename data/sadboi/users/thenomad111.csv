spirituality,fn5bxfx,t3_fzm4is,1586660901.0,"My perspective is: It is because they are not actually enlightened. Can't relate to other people? You can't relate to people only when you are on the path to enlightenment. You are going down that road, but you are ego yet, and no one else goes down that path, so you suffer. Spiritual awakening people refer to in this sub is just an intellectual awakening, that this kind of stuff exists. Some will even watch a meditation video and go on to say I am awakened. No you are not, it is just the first seed.

When you are enlightened you should relate to anyone I think. If you see that we are the same how can you not relate? If you are more closely connected to the universe how can you be lonely?

Of course I am not enlightened so take these with a grain of salt. I am only deducting this from the concept of enlightenment and from watching some people whom I consider more enlightened."

Try other meditations or listen to practitioners to see what the goal and principle of meditation is and why it is good for you etc before doing it so you feel safe."

I looked around in his forums a couple of times and didn't like what I saw. Also the forum members too, to be honest. People with normal egos I am okay with, but I really don't like spiritual egos.

They did not do anything physical, just they always made fun of me and threatened me, these four pathetic life forms that could only find a way to feel good and bond together by scaring someone weaker than them. I have gotten a lot stronger, learned to stand up for myself years eventually, I even fought other people physically, won half of them lol and man it felt very good. Taking a beating is not a big deal, I only want not to bow down you know that is what is great. But that taste of being helpless and panic stricken is still a part of me. I always had a dream of running across them, and if I did, to make their faces unrecognizable. And I was deadly serious about this. I know in my heart that I would do it.

After reading your post, I am very curious what I would do if one of them reached out to me and said he was sorry, never really thought about that. I know they were just kids at that time, man we change by experience and learning, and that instinct, need to be superior to someone is deep in us, especially during teenage years, and I was not an angel myself.. but still the wish of vengeance and payback is so strong it overrides any sense of empathy and understanding.

spirituality,fjedj8b,t1_fjdws5n,1583269882.0,"Well thanks, but all I have right now is some intellectual understanding of what others are saying, what I feel is right, and the fact that meditation is amazing for me when I can manage it.

I don't think any guru etc. thinks or says your body is useless, at least I have not heard them say it myself. You are for some reason (supposedly we are here to learn and experience, which feels right to me too, in that case all these physical stuff is very important at least for now) here in this body and mind so it definitely should serve some purpose. Enlightened beings would not be able to spread their messages if they did not have a body and mind or if they did not take good care of their body. Most of them say feel your body as much as you can, use your senses fully when living, take care of your physical realm etc. It is like we currently need the illusion to grow.

They are also not trying to make you deny your current reality, in fact they are telling you to accept it fully, but just go inside as well. Again, no wise man would deny that physical world needs them. Why did they start to teach their teachings then? They are obviously accepting that they are needed. 

We are right now, using body and mind to learn and grow. We can still appreciate and cherish them. But we don't need to identify with them, that is when the problems start, especially identifying with the ego. As far as I understand, they are actually saying what feels right to you too."
spirituality,fjdv9du,t3_fcy7sx,1583259928.0,"If you go to the people describing there is no sense of self and punch them in the face, they would still defend themselves (maybe Jesus would not though :D). As I understand it, people mean two different things when they sense of self. One is what I believe your true sense of self is, the pure consciousness, awareness within. Or soul maybe. That one can not be taken away, it is impossible. The other sense of self are the details occuring in it or things it identifies with, I am a man, I am from Italy, I am a teacher etc. That kind of sense of self is the illusion, you are not a teacher, you are the Self that has identified with being a teacher at the moment. So I think for example when Buddha said no self, he meant the second sense of self. But some mean the consciousness when they say sense of self so it becomes hell of a lot confusing.

So you will naturally avoid danger etc, just you do not need the second, fake self (Ego) to defend yourself. If you are identified with egos, a strong ego will probably protect you better compared to a wounded ego. But if there was no ego in the first place, then you would defend yourself in the best way. The construct will only confuse you.

I see it this way, and I am sure some enlightened beings are talking about this when they say ego and sense of self etc. 

I am not sure if I answered your question, it is just my take on these things."

We are obviously not our mind but it is ours after all.

You have got a LOT of different types, schools and people and if you do not listen to yourself and what feels right to you, you have a huge risk of only going in circles and getting lost in theories. And to me some opinions are really laughable and pointless, sorry to judge.

I only care about silencing my mind nowadays, because that is when I become peaceful and more alert, and I literally had zero negative outcome of doing that. Personally I don't care much about manifesting, don't want psychic or energy powers, if they are real and somehow come in the future then okay but that is not what I am after.

spirituality,fidhsmc,t1_fia2kaj,1582367132.0,"I also think a considerable amount of people are enjoying it, or at least having some satisfaction out of it. Looking back at my previous behaviors and mindset, my past and present friends, I can see that. Man you should see some of my friends taking pleasure of being in constant battle, hating others and having a negative approach to life, creating unnecessary pessimistic dramas. One of my friends had a great amount of satisfaction to debunk anything that touches a normal person's heart: that love actually doesn't exist, soul doesn't exist, everyone is selfish in nature, a mother's love is actually selfish, emotions are actually meaningless and just chemical stuff, and so on and such like. Look at some of the philosophers and scientists proudly announcing that reality sucks.

They are not enjoying it with all their hearts, they ARE actually suffering don't get me wrong and part of them must hate that negativity, but the addiction is definitely there. Negativity strengthens the ego after all. They are suffering, but not realizing it, and in this sense I agree with you. I don't think there is any judgement in stating this. Or maybe there is who knows, I am not claiming that I am free from my ego or enlightened. Ego may work in mysterious ways :)

Thanks a lot for your detailed response. Will try some of these. I have been doing similar things actually in a limited scale, that is how I started to feel neutral to myself instead of dislike. Spiritiuality and a sense of community really helps. I approach to my pain in a less criticizing way but still no real compassion."

Antipsychiatry,f4vvx4f,t1_f4vrtry,1571848573.0,"I went to two psychiatrists and a psychologist after I smelled bullshit and left. One is known as the best psychiatrist in my country. All three of them told me I was never psychotic and I know more about psychosis than my ex-therapist. 

The point of the story seem to me very grim. Anyone can make mistakes and make a wrong diagnosis. But your credibility dropping like shit after they judge you insane is very infuriating. And the fact that they try to turn you against you because they saw you insane makes me mad. It shouldn't be this easy to discredit someone.

There is a well known investigation in psychiatric history. A reporter acts like a schizophrenic to make himself admitted to investigate asylums and he (or she, I don't remember the details) had a tough time to get out. He totally acts normally inside but every move he makes is judged insane. He says he is a reporter but they think he is getting delusional again and do not believe him and push more drugs in his system. He is released by outside help from his partners who verify his story.

I shudder to think how many are judged wrong. I am not even sure that someone can be permanently insane anyway. And as you said, the definition of delusion is sketchy as well.

You are right, one should always go to a lot of doctors before making a final decision."
Antipsychiatry,f4uu698,t3_dkwtqh,1571829122.0,"I don't know about your case but one of my ex-therapists once diagnosed me with psychosis onset or some shit like that, then it went downhill. Anything I did not agree with her, she blamed delusion LMAO. For a month I used antipsychotics, then I brought her a SCIENTIFIC ARTICLE that CONCLUDED antipsychotics have very high risks of tardive dyskinesia. She did not even look at the data and article because I was delusional. She said she saw few people with that side effect so I must be delusional lol. I was a lot saner than that idiot.

Just one doubt of psychosis, delusion, that is enough then expect any kinds of abuse."

Psychosis is probably tied to some profound spiritual experience but sadly there is no spirituality experts to tutor these 'patients' anymore. You must be really strong to continue with this alone. Though in a spiritual sense we are never alone but still I wanted to say it."

You said you are jobless, how do you get your needs? If you can, you can also start therapy, I don't know if you have insurance or insurance covers therapy in your country.

You can find out spiritual practices and apply it to your life, they will definitely help, especially in knowing yourself."
spirituality,f3u5ri7,t3_di79u9,1571153494.0,"There is evidence for spirituality, albeit not scientific proof in today's standard. I think first you should research the idea that the brains do not create consciousness. It is based on a materialist and physicalist view after all. You can be fooled by the state of technology today, but actually both views are just assumptions. Read the opposite side of the views.

There are even neurologists who say it is very possible, that consciousness may be primary in the universe, though they are on the minority. If consciousness is not material then you can call it the soul, yes? Then look in the documented cases of NDE that science can not understand and brush them as hallucinations, as if they know why hallucinations occur in the first place. Once you see the flaws of the science, then you may merge science and spirituality. Use it only as an analytical tool."

To be honest it can be many things, if he really believes what he is saying he might be schizophrenic (though I believe he would show more bizarre behaviors if he is), he can be narcissistic, or he may have no specific mental disorders but just knows he is a complete wreck and feels he has to lie to feel important.

spirituality,f33buoy,t3_dff2ey,1570635645.0,"As far as I know Higher Self is not necessarily in control. You are a small part or projection of Higher Self, and you can get out of touch with it. If you do not follow the road your Higher Self planned to before your incarnation, your alignment with your Higher Self gets worse and worse and you experience all kinds of misery. People have free will so sometimes misery becomes too much because they are so out of alignment with their true selves they kill themselves.

Take this with doubt though I am a newbie to spirituality. But as I understand it this is why in my opinion."

You can adopt new points of views, create your new path as i did or even blend spirituality with psychology and logic if you do not want to drop it (as in do not believe 11:11, I don't too by the way, or see spiritual insights as psychological inner searchings). It takes a while but it is definitely possible. I am not saying do not be spiritual though, just take care of your balance and yourself and go where you need to go.

I was a materialist and digged science a lot before I started the spiritual path. Weirdly I feel a lot saner now. So I do not really care if my beliefs are consistent with mainstream ideas or objective reality, which means jackshit to me because our understanding of it will most likely change as we find new data. No one will know what objective reality is at least for a thousand years and that is being optimistic.

Just do whatever will make you feel good, is what I am saying. Don't worry too much about what truth is as long as you feel okay and stable."
