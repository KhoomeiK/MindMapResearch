questions,fl72p33,t3_fmwx9n,1584892780.0,"my experience: i started doing online school 2 years ago in the middle of 7th grade and still do it now. i have really bad social anxiety and would make myself throw up sometimes to avoid going to school. for some reason i thought isolating myself from other people would improve it (obviously not, it's just enforced my anxiety) and i can't say it's significantly made my life better. none of my friends really made an effort to keep up with me once i left, and vice versa. 

one positive is you can take your schoolwork wherever, i've traveled a lot in the past year and could do my work on the plane etc. 

i'd say only homeschool your kids if they have lots of outside of school activities (sports, theatre...) and if they are very self motivated. one of my problems is procrastination and distractions, it's hard to do algebra when i can just click on youtube. make sure they would be motivated enough to teach themselves hard concepts.
