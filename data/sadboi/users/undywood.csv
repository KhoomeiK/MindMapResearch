I don't know your situation, and I dont expect you to share.

I am sad that life is this hard for us

I am glad you are still here."
SuicideWatch,fit80f0,t3_f9d5go,1582708754.0,"I want to die sometimes.  I wont ever kill myself because my family, namely my wife and son mean to much to me.  But there are days I just cant deal. There are days that those two are pretty much the only bright points keeping me from literally pulling the trigger.  

And so I cope. And have a few drinks so I can sleep."
ptsd,f6ymnit,t1_f6w2f1p,1573287328.0,Thank you for your response.  Is therapy expensive?  I edited my post to explain why I haven't sought therapy as of yet.   Maybe you can answer my questions?
ptsd,f6ymknf,t1_f6w5c2j,1573287244.0,"Thank you for your response.  I'm going to look over the list and see what I can do.

Something I've done that helps me relax is to travel in my mind to a favorite place, on a creek bank.  I focus on the gravel and sand beneath my feet, and the smell of the air. The breeze.  It helps... sometimes."
ptsd,f6ymjbx,t1_f6wl6uy,1573287209.0,"Dad knows that's it's been hell on me, but I don't know that anyone outside of my wife, and this forum knows that I still struggle with it.  Thank you for your kind words."
ptsd,f6ymfoq,t1_f6wmhqz,1573287092.0,"Thank you.  It's weird thinking about how relatively calm I maintained for that first 24 hours.  It was a fight to help my dad, then I allowed myself to vent on the drive to the hospital, but then I had to go into damage control and help keep my mom and sisters together."
ptsd,f6ym7w8,t1_f6wtdw0,1573286870.0,I may take you up on that. Thank you.
ptsd,f6ym216,t1_f6wrrzg,1573286698.0,Don't apologize for rambling. This helps.  I've been disgusted by the fact that I don't really look at my dad as my dad anymore.  He's just too different.  My dad died in the ditch that day.
