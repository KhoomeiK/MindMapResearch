The only downside is maybe the battery life. I've been on 17 hour runs were I needed a headlamp for a couple hours in the morning and then a couple in the evening and the Bindi is totally fine for that.

I come from an ADHD and depressive background, overweight, former smoker and drug abuser when I was in high school and some of college. 

Then few years ago after college I began climbing and got in shape. Then I started cycling and running. And then I started running ultra distances (before I even knew that ultras were a thing). I also adopted the keto diet after I started having Celiacs-like symptoms any time I ate any type of carbohydrate (still haven't figured that one out, but keto fixes it).

Running has had a tremendous impact on my mental wellbeing. Sometimes I actually forget just how much more content and balanced I've become in the passed 2-3 years. I'm not the same person at all. I'm still trying to change to be a better person, and running is an integral part of that somehow. 

And finally when you talk about finding a 'fine line' between being reasonable with training, and overdoing it, I'm that way as well. I enjoy putting together training blocks and pushing myself really hard, and not even for a race but maybe just a particular planned long run or FKT."
