seniorkitties,fma4oyg,t1_fm9e7a7,1585883753.0,"I would sleep with my cats until my boyfriend and I got together, but ever since then, they have slept out in the living room. He stopped letting them come in because Kira would start screaming at him at 4am (her feeding time was 6am). She would do that to me in the past, but I was so accustomed to it, that I would ignore it, and she would eventually tire herself out. When she did sleep with me, she would sleep right next to my head. I would sleep in the middle of the bed, so there was a space between my pillow and the edge of the bed, and she would take the right side every night. Now, she can't jump on the bed, as her arthritis in her back legs has progressed, plus she is fat, so I am sure that doesn't help either. However, Kira was never much of a jumper, I attribute it to her broken sternum. The vets say that it is super common in cats, and it's apparently caused by birth, being stepped on, or some other trauma. So basically it feels like there is a bone sticking out of her stomach.

I have had my cats since they were babies, so they grew up together. It is kind of interesting how much cats fight, even when they have been around each other for so long! Of course, they really only bat each other around every now and again, with their spats, as you described. Lia and Kira will also groom each other, most often at the same time. So Kira will be licking Lia's face while Lia is trying to lick Kira's face, and it is so amusing and adorable.

I am sure that they love each other! I have noticed with my calico that if she does not like another cat, she will not have ANYTHING to do with them. She won't even acknowledge their existence. 

I have never met another calico, so I cannot put my two cents in, but I know that Kira is VERY vocal, and she'll let you know when she's cranky. Kira talks to me all the time as well, but it is typically for food. Lia will talk all the time as well, but she does it for the attention. 

I love my babies so much. I also agree with you, that I am so happy that I am able to enjoy their companionship and love. I am so happy that they adopted me as their fur mom. 

Of course! I do not mind talking to you at all! You seem to be a very lovely person with two lovely fur children! Please, if you need something to take your mind off of the times, don't hesitate to shoot me a chat. It was lovely talking to you as well <3"
seniorkitties,fm9aitz,t1_fm98n8e,1585864845.0,"Kira is very very sassy, she rules me. Lia is a daddy's girl (always liked men more) and she rules my boyfriend. 

Lia is very dominant, and will be a jerk to Kira just because she can. For example, she'll eat kira's food, even though she has her own food bowl (which is full at all times, of course).

Kira has gotten more cuddly as she's gotten older. Lia has always been the cuddly type. If you move when Lia is laying on you, she will scream at you and won't look at you until you tell her ro come back. If you dont tell her, about 5 minutes afyer pouting, she'll very slowly, and very sneakily, come back onto your lap. It's so funny. 

Kira, as she is fat, will sit right in eyes view of you when it's an hour and a half before dinner. Right at 4:30, she will be there, staring at you. Making sure she doesnt miss out on feeding time lol 

It's so interesting how they develop their own very unique and prominent personalities.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to spend one-on-one time with your father. Especially when you're younger (Idk how old you are), because it is important to show children that they are important individually as well, and need to be shown that they are seen that way by their parents. I wish my own father understood that... 

I would suggest wording it as: when the chance was given for some one-on-one time, I wanted to take the chance since I don't get that as often as step brother does. I didn't originally have an issue with sister coming along since she is in the same boat as I am in, and it seems rude to take her time away from you when I know how that would feel given our similar situations.

healthcare,fkr113l,t1_fkqwk6h,1584459733.0,"I do completely agree with you on this one. 

The main reason I am fixated on the masks was due to the lack of truthful information. 

I wish to eventually work in the health care industry (currently in school now), but as of now, I work in a restaurant (which I am unemployed from, for now), and the amount of people who don't know how to stay home when sick, cover their mouth when they sneeze or cough, keep an appropriate distance from people, or have common human decency, amazes me. Especially in the restaurant. I have also noticed the lack of social distancing in stores as well. 

It also aggravates me that people are going about their daily lives as if nothing is happening. I haven't worked for 2 weeks. I started taking time off of work because I knew that this virus had already been spreading and I have an at-risk human living in my home. The amount of people who aren't taking this seriously and are being completely ignorant and selfish baffles me. Even with the argument of ""WeRE aLL GoiNg tO gEt SiCK aT sOMe poInT,"" they are completely ignoring the horrifying effects of mass infection. There are individuals in Flordia, partying during spring break, ignoring the risks of infection.

I have to admit, yes, that masks are such a minimal part of the equation, but if the country had better prepared for this, I feel that a mask, even a DIY one, would have lessened the amount of infections (even if it is a minute amount), as well as lessened the crazed amount of sheer panic going on."

Not only that, if we talk about the mass hysteria going on, wouldn't masks be a good idea for the general public to lessen the panic? Granted, yes, we shouldn't encourage the idea that masks and gloves are magical shields, but if they give people some type of mental cushion, then why not?

I also don't remember him saying the devil made him do it. I think his explination was that his wife was mad because he was drinking. An argument ensued. She threatened him with a knife. He said do it (as in stab him). She ""nudged"" him with the knife. They physically fought. His head ended up getting hit (because it was bleeding when he was arrested.) He got ahold of the knife and stabbed her in the neck. 

Then he skinned her and gutted her (with the same knife), threw her remains into the sewage (you can see in the photos he, or the police, removed the toilet) to hide what he had did. I'm not sure how they were able to recover the bag of remains though. There was quite a lot in the bag that was entailed in the crime scene photos. 

There is a 14 year old son that the man has as well, though I dont know if that's with his now deceased wife or ex wife. I am unaware where he was during this. 

I am also unaware how much ""torture"" went on. Neighbors heard her screaming.. Though, who wouldn't after getting stabbed in the neck? However, the reports say she was tortured. Granted, it's also going to be really hard to fucking tell what kind of torture went on with this autopsy...."

Want some?"
relationship_advice,fgmci64,t3_ez73tv,1580921948.0,"So in my circumstance, my boyfriend is much older and has a lot more experience. I've slept with 4 people (not including him) and he's slept with way way way more than that. It also came with his career choices when he was younger, but besides that.... 

It was intimidating at first, but it turned out to be a wonderful experience because he taught me so much, and the sex is amazing.
 
However! He's never bragged about it or randomly brought his past up in a situation specifically focused on us. We've shared stories, but it was very mutual. Plus they were more like: what's the grossest experience? Most fun? Awkward? Weird location? Wildest? Etc. 

I would suggest telling him he's making you uncomfortable about his constant discussion about his past, especially when your presently in the location it took place. Tell him maybe one day you'd like to hear his previous sex stories, but right now you don't. 

He doesn't respect that? Cut him loose."
