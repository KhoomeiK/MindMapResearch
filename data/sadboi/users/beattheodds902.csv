Yorkies,flxk4pe,t3_frko5d,1585584457.0,"First of all, she is beautiful. I'll give my back story so you have an idea of where my opinion is coming from - I rehomed a yorkie when she was 4.5 years old who had been used for breeding her entire life. When I brought her to her first vet check up, the vet was able to move her entire front row of teeth on the top, and the bottom. \*audible gasp\*. He told me these teeth needed to go NOW to prevent infections spreading, as the front rows of teeth were all rotten, and the rest were absolutely covered in plaque, I was told she would always have gum disease. After her front rows of teeth were removed, she had a 180 change, she was enjoying food again and playing with toys, and overall it was obvious it relieved a lot of discomfort for her. Fast forward 5 years, Roxy is 9.5, very healthy, but the rest of her teeth are beginning to show signs that they're ready to go. I think about it a lot, because I know how happy she was after her first removal, but with her age now - I worry. I would express your concerns with your vet that a surgery like this could potentially be fatal (that's my first thought when it comes to them having to go under for an operation) and that you worry whether or not it's worth it given her age. My vet told me they could do an assessment of her health and give me a clearer idea of how anesthesia would affect her. If your girl is super healthy, perhaps this is the chance you have to boost her health into superyorkie and she will be able to give you many more years of love. My fear is that if you leave it unattended, more health issues will come up and there will be a point you are unable to help despite wanting to. I too sit here and debate my yorkies teeth all coming out, I think if I knew for certain she would be alright going under for the surgery, that I would do it. I truly think dental is one of the areas that truly impact the health of a dog, and though expensive can be absolutely life changing. Best of luck to you and your girl!!"

As you're a tourist, have a decent budget and want to keep your family safe, I have no issue recommending you look for hotels in Las Condes - it's a higher class area of the city and seems to remain the most protected due to the status of those living there. The Marriott is there, and I'm sure there are some others a quick google search will pull up. Perhaps even calling the Marriott, as they'd have English speakers and potentially more information about your concerns."

Perhaps try to plan something calm, away from the more populated downtown protest areas, for that evening. Although I think it's important for tourists to truly see what's going on here, I don't think it's the best situation to put yourself in right away!
