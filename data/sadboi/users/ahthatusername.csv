But every time that i explode in anger (not so often, not for that long) i feel myself again. I'm afraid that if i get too much better i will be deprived of my identity, even tho i love how things are going and i know that that's not my ""real identity"" but just something I'm used to. This is the most stable period of my life and I'm terrified that it could keep on getting better, because i wouldn't know what to do, but at the same time I'm also scared that something horrible is going to happen, like a major episode that would ruin everything or an external tragedy like someone dying. I don't want things to get ruined and i lowkey wish i could ruin them myself so that i have someone to blame."

It happened to me last summer, suddenly, for the first time in my life, music, the only thing i was sure would never disappoint me, was completely boring. I could just listen to a couple of songs from Queen, but it wasn't that i liked them, it was that i hated them a little bit less than the rest. I know how this feeling can leave you disoriented and hopeless and I'm sorry. For me i got out of that period, one of the worst of my entire life, by quitting antipsychotics. Now i feel I've never been better and I'm only doing progress. So i dont really know how to help you in your case, but just know that it's possible to get out of that."

Personally, i wrote a few letters from my ""stable"" self to my ""in the middle of a crisis"" self, and i find a little bit of comfort reading my own words reminding me that life isn't always what I'm feeling in that moment, since when I'm in a certain mood/state of mind, i struggle with imagining that other ways of being and feeling exist, even if i rationally know moods different than the one I'm feeling do exist (confusing sentence, sorry, hope i was clear).

iamatotalpieceofshit,f77stef,t1_f76x34e,1573474262.0,"I understand why it might be weird to someone. Maybe this is my opinion because I've met a few couples whith a huge (but legal) age gap, and i saw no reason to doubt their love nor the health of their relationship. A 20yo (male or female) might of course be naive or less experienced, but is definitely not a child, has not the body of a child nor the mind of one. If A likes B because of their young face and body, i personally believe there's no difference between this and A liking B for any other physical characteristic, like having blue eyes or curly hair. Of course we're talking of a relationship between two people where both are mentally able to understand and make decisions, and no one is manipulating the other (which can sadly happen at any age even between same age partners)."

It's better to spend a couple more months vegetarian (which is still a progress to be proud of) and use that time to better understand how to vegan, than to transition all at once and having either some deficiency cause you don't know what you're doing, or some mental/emotional problem due to others judging, your mom, stress of not knowing what to do and how to deal with stuff.
