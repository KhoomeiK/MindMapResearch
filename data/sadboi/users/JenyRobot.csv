I wasn't meaning it in that ""factory"" kind of sense. I mean, yes, your example does make sense but then that would be too much and in no way a woman or a man can handle so many of spouses at once. A woman can only handle so many of her husbands' rights at once. Like, we all know women can't do that. At least I know I can't. One husband can go out and provide for 4 wives at once according to his duty but can one wife attend to all 4 husbands at once as it is her duty? That's just gonna break relationships.

Okay, I wasn't aware of that. Thanks for sharing.

Islam is full of misogynistic values? Where?
http://en.al-shia.org/content/various-rights-women-islam
Read this and tell me it's written against women. No, women empower Islam as much as men do. Islam fully recognizes this.

I think you're not understanding where Islam draws the line of beating women. There's literally only one, I repeat one Quranic verse that says something on this matter and as I said before in another reply, this verse has various interpretations. The more common interpretation is one I argued about before.
Here, read this: https://www.al-islam.org/hidden-truths-gods-word-sayyid-mujtaba-musawi-lari/look-meaning-daraba-quran

I'm sorry, I am not indoctrinated since childhood. In fact, I would argue against that. I am a Twelver Shiite and I don't say anything my father taught me. I gave you two links from Shiite websites written by Shiite scholars that are not my fathers or teachers irl. Ok."
EdensZero,fljevfm,t3_fouvll,1585209553.0,I think EZ's story is better than FT's. But I also think FT's characters were more lovable than EZ's. I kinda slightly prefer FT over EZ.
Coronavirus,fljdw4q,t1_fliu2l0,1585208385.0,"Look, I'm NOT defending wife-beating here. The thing is, you don't know a miswak (unless you do), it doesn't hurt, it's NOT violent. I'm not a married woman either okay, don't jump to that assumption. Plus God HAS given the wife chances to discontinue her loyalty until she crosses the line, the woman brings it upon herself. Unless she turns to divorce, that's a solution to get what she wants, and then the ex no longer has ANY right to even touch her gently.

Ok let me tell you why God lets a man have 4 wives. I KNEW somebody would bring this up so I had already prepared the answer.

Look, first, take an example of a man having 4 wives. He can have four women pregnant at once. 4 children! But if a woman has more husbands, one of them has to wait a year to get his child, another needs to wait 2 years, and the another 3 years. It's just suffering from both ends.
Also, in the old times, there was an issue of not being able to figure out who the father is. It's not an issue today of course with DNA testing.
Polygamy is also in the nature, like a lion can have more than 1 mate but you don't see a lioness have more than 1 mate.

I can also spend all day correcting your misconceptions about Islam. Woman may be oppressed in Islamic countries, but they are not oppressed in Islam. Many Islamic countries barely even follow Islam lol (and I'm a deep Saudi hater right here sorry not sorry).
It's not Stockholm Syndrome, I've never heard a woman be disloyal to her husband and have him beat her and be affectionate towards him. Instead, she would be sending out full-throttle curses all day, all night. And I'm speaking from actual experience here. Most women get angry and go to their parents' house until both of their anger boils down. Of course, what you see everyday is jackasses abusing wives ""just because"" and Islam does not preach this. One of our deceased Shiite Ayatollahs, Ayatollah Fadhlallah had actually given the fatwa that if a husband is abusive, the woman has the right to be abusive towards him in self defense as well. But let me tell you, if the woman strikes back with little physical strength and wounds, the husband is sure to get 100% more mad and end up with murder. It's altogether safer to leave or divorce."
Coronavirus,flfuxan,t1_flenysc,1585118754.0,"That's...not even domestic violence. It's just a light strike and it's supposed to be with a *miswak*, which doesn't even hurt at all, doesn't leave a mark, and it's forbidden to hit the face and cause pain over any other body part, that's clearly not domestic violence, and it's supposed to be the *last* step after warnings. Have you actually read the whole thing? There are various interpretations of that Quranic verse, and several *Ahadees* from the Prophet *SAWW* regarding it. As a woman myself, I must say that a *woman* does deserve some kind of harmless punishment if she cheats on her husband, it's her fault and it's stage 3 after warnings. But the husband *deserves* punishment if he does damage to the body and relationship than repair them both.

It's stated there that Jurists have argued, though the light beating may be acceptable, it's *makrooh*, a highly undesirable act which has a reward if avoided. There are many other acts which are *makrooh* like cutting nails at night, it's not *haram* but it's not encouraged either.

Yes, you are free to express your opinion. But it is not your ""duty"" to ""share your opinion"" (which is actually just starting a debate under a disguise name).

Critism is not a negative thing. Who actually said you ""should"" be happy with the manga with its current quality. I mean, I actually agree with your critism.
