bipolar,fbrbtf5,t1_fbqu0a9,1577041431.0,You too?!  I'm there myself.
bipolar,fbm6fln,t3_edy2rz,1576979224.0,I so can relate.  I used to binge every weekend to bring myself down from the hypomania I used to get myself through the work week.  It often doesn't end well.  For me it triggered both manic and depressive episodes and wound me in the hospital.
GaySnapchat,fair5cx,t1_faiqi5l,1576114654.0,What's yours?
GaySnapchat,fahvjgo,t1_fahur2o,1576094377.0,Done
bipolar,f9v88rh,t1_f9v7498,1575664861.0,"Yep, though I lasted a year and a half, I did call in many times.  I don't know how to describe what happens with me when I have to resign.  It just feels like one day there's this boulder on my shoulders and I'm about to collapse into a puddle of tears, I then resign in a panic, go home, cry and sleep for 3 days."
bipolar,f9v6omq,t3_e70x5n,1575664080.0,I'm another like you describe but I don't think it's a BP trait.  With me it's anxiety and low self esteem.
bipolar,f9v6cjs,t3_e72m53,1575663917.0,Inpatient helps a lot.  Just don't let them kick you out prior to actually receiving the benefit of being there.

bipolar,f9kptwr,t1_f9kpoce,1575405446.0,"And yes, I suppose I can and will.  And he will too.  It just is very rough and a long, painful process.  I wish the best for you all :)"
bipolar,f9kpoce,t1_f9k1prr,1575405354.0,"That was absolutely beautiful and I thank you so much for your kind words.  It almost made me tear up.  I pray people realize that we are really trying so hard.  It's a very fickle, discouraging and frustrating illness.  I feel like a loser because it looks like I'm not trying but I am, very hard.  It's so difficult.  It makes all those things others take with ease absolutely monumental."
bipolar,f9ivj3l,t3_e59acq,1575347105.0,Me!
bipolar,f9i20sk,t1_f9i0yul,1575326408.0,I do use a mood app and things are pretty much on the depressive and anxious side.  At least not through the roof though.
bipolar,f9i1xae,t1_f9hxn7z,1575326343.0,Nope.  It's following a nervous breakdown from too much stress.  I wasn't manic though.
bipolar,f9htgko,t1_f9hsyyg,1575321410.0,It's quite possible that I have both.  Typically I just feel like sleeping all day every day.
bipolar,f9htdhw,t1_f9hs562,1575321363.0,I'll have to try and hope it resolves.
bipolar,f9hrs32,t1_f9hqsb0,1575320469.0,"I just started.  My second appointment isn't for another week.  I also get mixed episodes and they're hell.  I can't seem to find a proper balance, in anything."
bipolar,f9hro1r,t1_f9hqqzp,1575320405.0,"That's kind of where I am.  That is, just trying to push though and do whatever to move out of it.  I bought a light therapy box, started seeing a counselor and looked up info on a part time job today.  I guess it's a matter of fake it till you make it?"

bipolar,evw1d7s,t1_evvzfoc,1564852664.0,Absolutely.  I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
bipolar,evvx777,t1_evvx1d2,1564849663.0,"Yeah, I'm bad at remembering titles usually, however this title was memorable due to it containing a term that describes exactly how it feels to have a loved one with BPD."
bipolar,evvvow5,t1_evvuvc3,1564848560.0,"I'm a little skeptical to how much meds can help stabilize the mood of someone with BPD, as there's very little reason it should do anything.  A lot of people with Bipolar (myself included) get worse in the Summer.  It's not necessarily SAD.  No, people with BPD aren't lunatics, it was bad wording.  Their behavior can come across as loony but so can Bipolar's, just for different reasons."
bipolar,evvvfoq,t1_evvuygh,1564848373.0,Are you sure it's just pain?  That could just be a manic episode.
bipolar,evvvao4,t1_evvu90k,1564848271.0,"Yep, it's Stop Walking on Eggshells :)"
bipolar,evvu8co,t1_evvtnnr,1564847488.0,"It's tough, because unless a psychiatrist or counselor sees all the patterns and reasons for the swings, Borderline is often misdiagnosed as Bipolar.  They kind of need to assess interpersonal relationships and such, lol"
bipolar,evvthgh,t3_clhci3,1564846944.0,"For me, it can sometimes feel like I'm in my head, watching my life play out as if it's a movie.  Colors look warped and time feels like it's slowed.  Very surreal."
bipolar,evvtbam,t3_cliiwa,1564846818.0,"I'm very atypical in that I noticed improvement in just a few days, despite only starting at 25mg."
bipolar,evvt80y,t3_cljzja,1564846751.0,"Borderline is actually VERY different from Bipolar.  Yes, they both share impulsivity and mood swings but with Bipolar the swings are more chemical, whereas Borderline is more to do with one's personality.  Also, people with Bipolar typically don't swing moods several times in the same day at the drop of a hat.  The stigmatized behavior of those that don't understand Bipolar that makes people think we're lunatics is actually more in line with Borderline."

bipolar,evi6g9j,t1_evi55p4,1564537777.0,"Yep, typically my resignations are BP related but the half day one was purely panic attack related."
bipolar,evi3c2p,t1_evi2o8m,1564536366.0,It was more panic disorder related than BP though.

bipolar,evfpzrv,t3_cjrk1z,1564499511.0,"I hate when people assume we're more in line with what would actually be Sociopathic or Psychopathic.  Some also think it means we act in ways that are actually more in line with Borderline, that we're abusive and snap, with moods singing seemingly randomly in one day, etc."
bipolar,evfpfe2,t3_cjsp4g,1564499270.0,"Mine are covered, ever since I upped to 300."

bipolar,evditej,t3_cjhogr,1564439272.0,"It's the one and only medication that stabilizes me effectively.  It keeps me as close to middle ground as possible, not swaying hardly at all into manic or depressive states."
bipolar,evd9k2u,t3_cjgz16,1564433133.0,"I used to binge at the bar once a week for that purpose, yep.  Throughout the week, my hypomania drove my work performance then I'd use the weekend to ease it."

bipolar,evcn0y5,t1_evcmq4d,1564418827.0,"Hm.  Not being a psychiatrist, I'm kind of at a loss towards what it might be.  It might not be anything and she's just a moody person with a temper problem (shrug)"
bipolar,evclvtg,t1_evcll9k,1564418133.0,"That's what I mean when I say it might not actually be anything but regular mood/responses.  Does she ever go from loving someone one second to misinterpreting innocent behavior as just not caring or loving her enough, then bam, she blows up at someone?  That kind of thing would be Borderline."
bipolar,evckgv3,t1_evcjv2b,1564417254.0,"Unfortunately, just the terms ""mania"" and ""manic"" make it sound to those that don't know better as if you're a psychopath.  Manic behavior also looks very odd to those not in the know.  I so get what you mean, lol"
bipolar,evc71c9,t1_evav0ol,1564408060.0,I understand that.  It's a rock and a hard place situation.
bipolar,evc6zbs,t1_evbwkh5,1564408017.0,"Well, it sounds like she wouldn't really be up for accepting that sort of thing but if it's causing great distress you could run it by your own therapist...?  That almost sounds more like a touch of Narcissist Personality Disorder or Borderline even."

bipolar,evb5lat,t3_cj4o15,1564366508.0,"Good question I'm trying to find out the answer to myself.  I just try to make as much down time as possible, even if I need to let others down by not attending to them.  Lots of naps, movies, books, guitar, long showers, meditation, etc.  I could never have a family because the stress of needing to be there for them is something I'm afraid I couldn't do well."
bipolar,evb1yyq,t1_evb0h20,1564363588.0,"Wow... I feel sorry for anyone that has the misfortune of knowing you personally.

I can't fathom what it is that would make you think I give a damn about superficial crap like upvotes, etc.  I was legitimately trying to help but thanks for assuming I'm a dick... how kind of you."
bipolar,evavqjs,t1_evavh9u,1564358573.0,"Sadly, that's the kind I'm seeing now.  And yeah, not tapering off a benzo can kill you.  I don't get how a psychiatrist doesn't know that (facepalm) lol"

bipolar,evaun5m,t3_ciy88g,1564357696.0,"From past experiences of my own, I know that when I feel the way you are, it's time to see a psychiatrist, whether you like it or not.  It's the only way your chaos will stop.  The destruction of type 1 is nothing to ignore."
bipolar,evau1dg,t3_cj29bb,1564357225.0,That's not necessarily ANY particular real illness.  Do you have other examples?  Do her moods swing throughout the same day or are there at least a few days of the same mood?  How is she with money and impulsivity?  Does she go from idolizing someone to hating them if she mistakes innocent behavior as a slight against her? Etc.
