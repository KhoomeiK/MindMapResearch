One thing that really has helped me keep up with online classes is having a planner. Every day I write a to-do list and write the time that I want to do everything at. 

I also make sure I’m taking my medication(s) as prescribed! That’s so important when it comes to staying motivated or I’d be very depressed during this time. 

Then I’ve been making sure to schedule in some fun time. Even if it’s just for half an hour, do something for yourself! Do you have any hobbies? Do those!
