You say your neighbour started “forcefully” kissing you, but you still took your dick out after that. Idk about you but if someone started forcefully kissing me that would be when I push them away, not when I unzip my pants. So you can’t really say she was forceful when you were clearly reciprocating. Good job for putting it back in I guess but if I was your gf that would’ve been the end of the relationship for me. And being drunk is no excuse. 

And you say you posted something on a pornstars page? That’s a bit of a red flag for me too. Don’t love the idea of buying the videos either but that’s just me. 

Don’t get me wrong I watch porn and masturbate and my bf does too, but It’d feel so wrong for me to post or comment on a specific actors page. And if my bf did the same I’d be pissed too. 

You’re both in the wrong here. She’s insecure to the point of making ultimatums and you probably don’t have as much self control as you think you do. You’re clearly not a good match."

Edit: especially grateful for our healthcare system when it comes to my grandma. 3 kinds of cancer over the last 22 years. Just before quarantine she had to have radiation treatment done for her thyroid cancer (I believe, sometimes what she says is confusing) after the cancer came back after having her thyroid removed (again I’m not entirely sure) last year. 

Along with her having diabetes for at least 20 years, multiple rounds of chemo and radiation, all her appointments and specialists. Free. Thank god for Canada.

AnimalCrossing,fp0xxx3,t1_foze3o2,1588219454.0,"To be fair, as someone who has worked foh at all different kinds of restaurants for 4 years, this is not always the case. The cutlery does quite a bit of travelling before it’s set on the table. Plus in higher end restaurants (such as the one I work in) cutlery is also polished. My restaurant is kept to a high standard where we are required to wear a sterile glove when polishing, but I’ve never seen this anywhere else. Many hands could have touched the cutlery and those hands may not always be as clean as you think. And then it gets put into a bin that probably hasn’t been cleaned in a while. And is collecting dust and crumbs and little hairs in the bottom. I guarantee you.  


Same with tables. You think the 15 second wipe down is cleaning the table well enough to justify putting cutlery straight down on it? Unlikely. And more often than not it isn’t actually sanitizing spray. It’s just vinegar and water until the health inspector comes around.  

Knowing what goes on behind the scenes definitely makes me more cautious, but I’d never make a scene about it. I’m just more mindful about checking my cutlery for spots or stuck on food before digging in, and I’ll usually give it a little wipe too. Basically, just about everything can be just as dirty as those bar citrus. As a bartender, I’m so anal about keeping my citrus fresh and my holders get washed regularly so I even use them for my own drinks. If I don’t feel confident doing that, I wouldn’t give it to a customer.

careerguidance,fos099l,t3_g8zhcy,1588021620.0,"I had a situation almost exactly like this! I was a social media manager too! And I sucked at it because I had no experience 

TL;DR I left that place because it just wasn’t worth it for me anymore 


I had a job like this for a while, was working for a restaurant group, initially in event planning. Didn’t even have any experience but they saw something in me and I turned out to be amazing at it and they loved me. The social media manager then left a few months later and despite me being the newest member of the team they asked me to take over the role. I had a reputation of being the “yes girl” so they knew I’d be up to the task.

I was terrible at it. Terrible. Every day I was expected to make a post on Instagram and every day I was going to my superiors looking for witty captions. 

Then the girl they had hired to replace me in my events role randomly quit without notice, and I ended up having to do both jobs. Within the same amount of time, expected not to go into overtime, making the same as I was making before. I started to get frustrated as I felt things kept being dumped on me, and left almost every day crying. 

Then the worst of it started. This woman who was originally hired as a hostess decided to elbow her way into the operations team. She was jealous of my closeness with the owners and superiors and often said out loud she wanted my job. She would go to them saying she wanted my job. I started to think she just wanted to be me. Eventually they gave her a chance, and we did not get along. She kept demanding to take more and more of my job, which she was not qualified, and was worse than I was at it. We got into this big blowout where I literally said “why would I teach you how to (send out menu options to large party guests) when you can’t even take a fucking reservation properly”

I got so fed up I told my superior I was not going to train her anymore, which she understood fully. The other girl decided she would give me $200 to train her because “I was the only one who knew (superior) well enough to know what she likes”. I took the money, did 2 hours of training with her off company time. I put in my notice and they begged me to stay, at least for a bit longer so I did. After I left she kept calling me asking “I sent you a file can you tell me if (supervisor) will approve of it”. Told her I’m not the fucking supervisor she should ask her herself, and blocked her number. Two weeks after I left, they fired her. 

Anyways my point is, if you’re not happy and you feel you’re not benefitting from this job, I would leave. It’s better than them eventually firing you and considering the current state of events any future employer should be able to understand a gap in your resume."

Prior to having my iud put in (about 2 months before) I had to have a D&C, and during that I was slightly sedated and had local anaesthesia, but it was the worst pain I’ve ever experienced in my life. The doctor who did it was amazing though as he talked to me the whole time about unrelated things to keep me distracted and had a nurse holding my hand too since my bf wasn’t allowed in with me.

The experience with that definitely prepared me for the unique pain I experienced when getting my iud in, but man did it fucking hurt, and I had popped 2 extra strength Advils about an hour before.

One thing I wanted to ask is were you on your period? Generally doctors try to do it then so the cervix is already somewhat open."
