My girl was fine eventually. She cried all night after it happened. She actually got into bed and snuggled right up to me. She couldn't move it at all, cried peeing and pooping. I got her painkillers but it took months for her tail to get back to normal. It was so sad. She always walked with her tail up. Seeing it down was horrible. I miss her a lot.

I was never allowed to listen to it growing up until I got to around 16 and finally had access to the internet. The amount of music I got then was crazy, but still, I'm not a big listener because it has never really been there. TV as background noise is actually better for me, music distracts me like crazy, I just end up singing along or if it's an instrumental, humming along or pausing to listen to a really beautiful part.

When I had Spotify it was great, I got to listen to so much stuff. I really enjoyed it! Losing it made me sad as I don't have a lot of the music I was listening to and with the free version, I can never just listen to one album in it's entirety. I'll end up hearing one or two songs and the rest will be completely random and it drives me bonkers."

Lupin was a good man to Harry, but that was it, he cared for the boy, but he was never that fatherly figure he desperately needed in the long run. He didn't write to Harry and only saw him in passing really, this must have hurt Harry, but at the same time, he was used to it. He never offered to save Harry from his abusers and I think that's why Harry was so much more fond of Sirius. 

I feel like Dumbledore probably forced Remus to stay away from Harry. Everyone respected that crazy man and he had his reasons, but if Remus had seen how they abused Harry, he may have stepped in and Harry may have lost his protective spell. He was also the filth of society due to being a werewolf, I bet there would have been an uproar if Lupin had taken the boy in.

I always felt like it was the older generation that had the issue with not knowing how to dress like a muggle. Kids seemed to follow fashion a lot more.

I wish they showed the girls wearing the short tie, that was common with us and not having your shirt tucked in was a big one. There was also the sneak tuck, if your shirt was big enough, you could tuck it in and have enough material hanging over the edge to make it look untucked. I got in trouble a lot for this. Then one day I was forced to tuck it in properly. My trousers were a good two to three sizes too big for me (I lost a ton of weight) and you could see down them easily.

If the rules were lax, I'm willing to bet they kept them off, especially as they got older and wanted to rebel a little more. I remember on a really, really hot day, we were allowed to have drinks on us at all times, not just at break and lunch, we could remove out blazers and ties and unbutton the top two buttons of our shirts.

I think if Harry stayed in contact with anyone, it would have been his cousin. He was abused as well and was hopefully smart enough to see it. 

From experience, my golden child cousins never made it out, they ended up trapped living at home with their mother, neither work and they're around 30. They never apologised for the things they did in any way and are crazy resentful and blame me and another kid we grew up with for it. I haven't seen them in person in ten years, before that I hadn't spoken to them in about eight, and I still get blamed. Dudley doing this, it showed he wasn't a bad kid and wanted to change. Nearly dying and then watching his parents attack the person who saved him, then having to still bow to his fathers pressure and not show any change in emotion towards his cousin must have been hard.

AskReddit,fr1y4nj,t1_fqzq05s,1589827907.0,"Same thing happened to me just after Christmas. Caught it from my boyfriends sister who flew in from Canada and had gone around the UK visiting tourist spots. I got incredibly sick, couldn't breathe, fever, the sore throat from hell. I had to keep it numbed 24/7 for a month or so it was that bad. I got pinkeye as well. I was having to use my inhaler constantly and ended up seeing a doctor, begging for something to help because I was in a mess. My temperature was 37.5 with paracetamol. I couldn't sleep because I would wake up 20 minutes later coughing up thick green phlegm. 

I was sick for a good couple of months, no voice for five/six weeks. My throat was so swollen it would close if I laughed. Once it was finally gone, I struggled to do anything. I was so tired. I went from the fittest in my kung fu class to the worst. I could barely do the warm up let alone keep up with the rest of the class. 

It was scary how sick I got. I was supposed to go home one weekend. My boyfriend took me home because I'd been away for two weeks and I had to go make sure my fish were ok. I stayed home for a day, sorted out the fish then went back to his. I just wasn't ready to be home alone. I'm now terrified of the virus because I don't want to get that sick again. I'm still trying to get my fitness back up. With being sick over Christmas, only going back to training for a month and a half, it's seriously messed with me."

I remember when I got my dog, I got her around the time my oldest cousin had his kid. Mums reaction to me getting a dog was, ""my brother gets a grandchild and all I get is a dog."" At the same time, all I was thinking is this person cannot be allowed around any child I might possibly have in the future. 

On my side I don't know anyone on my dads side, including my siblings. I only found out last year I have a sister, who is the same as as my mum, 36 years older and my brother is 29 years older then me. I've found my older nephew but I've never had the courage to message him as the bits I remember about his dad aren't good. I don't know how my sister would feel. I found the church she belongs to, but again, never had the courage to contact her. 

No idea how my boyfriends family would be. I think his sisters would make a big deal, but he very rarely sees them because they're all busy with their own lives and don't live close, one lives in Canada, so a bit far from the UK, the others live between me and him (he's a two hour drive away from me/five hour train ride). His parents live between their place here and Hong Kong. They don't see their family too often either. Everyone would be happy, but as I said, they've all been there before. It's nothing special. 

Currently I'm still not wanting to have my own. I want to be free just a little bit longer before I decide for sure if I want to have a kid. I love being around kids, I spent most of christmas just playing with the kids. I hadn't realised at one point that me and my boyfriend were sitting, playing with the kids in the living room and all the other adults had gone into the dining room to chat and eat. I was quite happy, we were battling bayblades. I only ever got to play with them on my own as a kid so it was fun playing with the kids."

With my boyfriend, his siblings have already given his parents six grandkids, so there wouldn't be that much excitement there either. It's weird. Knowing that you're never going to get a reaction like that from anyone. No one is ever going to care about you that much ever. The family in that video are so freaking lucky.

The only reason why I bought some that were in sets, was one, I couldn't get hold of the official at a reasonable price or like the bricktober sets, they weren't released here in the UK. I only ever saw it advertised in person at Toys R Us in Hong Kong when I visited a couple of years back. Importing them was crazy expensive for four minifigures. Everything else I bought was custom. Lego hadn't or weren't releasing those minifigures probably ever. I have freaking Kamen Rider and Sailor Moon minifigures which I adore! This is alongside around 1,400 official minifigures I own.

At that point I figured they would never show up. About a month and a half later, they arrived. For some odd reason, the packages had been sent from Hong Kong, repackaged in Malaysia and then shipped on to me. I have no idea what was going on, each one was packaged in two layers of plastic, both with paid postage to me from two different countries???

My ex told me once that he noticed I got upset and then pulled myself together and still had fun. I didnt ruin the night. I remember what had happened. I was at a birthday party and I ended up not having any food. By the time I got to the food table everything was gone (we all queued and I was at the back because I had talked to someone who had already gotten their food for a bit), even the crisps. I was upset because I was hungry and some people pushed in line to get seconds while I got nothing. Stupid me got upset. I get upset and hangry still. I've taken to carrying snacks around everywhere to combat it, especially on holidays as getting vegetarian food is near impossible sometimes."

My mum didn't know how to handle it and she would also cut it herself, badly. My hair was a big issue, but no one knew how to fix it. Mum would just threaten to cut it all off and for a girl who always wanted long hair, that was the worst idea ever. I spent years being ridiculed for it. I got in trouble because it was distracting. I eventually learned how to stick it down, but it was still red. As an adult I know how to deal with my hair. I straighten the crap out of it.

There was also the issue of getting in trouble for keeping our coats on us after we moved to the new school. Some of us didn't have lockers and mine was broken open very quickly after someone saw me grabbing my PE kit from there. Of cause I stopped using it. My coat stayed in my backpack and wasn't an issue. One teacher would lose it if she saw it and would kick us out of class or take our coats. We wouldn't get them back until the end of term either. Stupid rule. Oh, on the other site you weren't allowed to habe food or drinks on you (this included water) and you would be forced to throw your lunch away if they saw it in your bag or caught you having a drink outside of break and lunch. For a kid who got no breakfast and only a single sandwich with a slice of wafer thin ham on it, it was hell if I got caught.

I wasn't allowed to see other kids outside of school, let alone have any regular clothes (I wore hand me down male clothes, I'm a girl). Luckily my school had uniforms so people only knew from rumours about my clothes, until there was a wear your own clothes day. I still wish i could have been a normal kid/teen and joined in with all the crazy stuff. Even music, I missed out on all the music. I just heard stuff in movies and occasionally someone would let me listen to a song on their CD player. I had no music until I was 16/17 and got the internet at home, only the stuff I had as a kid and the only tape I still enjoyed was go green ranger. I was into rock and metal. Mum wasn't, so I wasn't allowed any music I liked. Even movie scores, she refused to buy me the Lord of the rings soundtrack!"

I was highly dehydrated, in so much pain just moving because my muscles hurt. I couldn't get my heart rate down and it was scaring me. Blood work came back as mr fighting a massive infection somewhere, but I had no injuries. They got me stabilised and I went home a few hours later with antibiotics and told to go straight back in if I got worse. 

Second, had a uti, it got so painful walking was hard. 

Third was this weird virus I caught around Christmas that made me so sick I couldn't breathe. I was using my inhaler way too much. I was coughing up thick green phlegm constantly, fever this time of 27.5 even with paracetamol, I couldn't sleep because I'd start coughing 20 minutes later. It was hell. I couldn't talk either, my throat was so painful I had it numbed 24/7. Laughing caused it to close up which was scary. Took over a month until I could talk again, I've only just started to sing again and can finally hit high notes again. I also got pinkeye. I had to go on antibiotics again because my chest was that bad. I had no energy for a couple of months, I went from being the fittest in Kung fu to not being able to complete a warm up."

I'm lucky that no one spat on me that time, threw stuff at me or tried to attack me physically. It never really died down again. Its been like this all my life, even my own mum called it a curse and hates red heads. 

On the other side of this, first day in America two years ago I got on a bus and another woman decided to have a go at me, she wasn't white (important for the story). She was going on about my pale skin and I must think I'm better then her and how privileged I am. When I didnt reply she got crazier and crazier to the point where the entire bus was staring at me. In my very English accent I told them I had no idea what she was talking about, I hadn't been in America a day yet. Luckily everyone starred at her again and left me alone. My life has been far from privileged. I'm lucky to have grown up here in the uk, but I spent my childhood alone, terrified, badly bullied and part of it was because I had bright red hair and very pale skin, oh and freckles, let's not forget them. 

As an adult it doesn't stop and its from all ages, genders and races. I also have the issue of being so tall, I don't fit the norm for a girl, so I'm accused of being gay and trans a lot. I get yelled at in the street for it, I've also been kicked out of changing rooms and toilets. I look like a normal girl, I'm just tall. All my life I've been told I'm not a real girl, that was the excuse boys used to beat me up as a kid. Hell, I've lost a ton of female friends because they can't handle the crap you get for hanging out with me. The ones I do have find it hilarious, but people are rude. Luckily I have some good lines for people who come up to us at this point, making a joke and making them look like fools. Even when I'm out with guys I'm dating it doesn't stop. Every single person, we've been accused of being gay or lesbians.

I missed him when he left. I think him helping me made his life hell there. He didn't even say goodbye. He was sad the last time we talked, didn't tell me what was wrong and never answered when I texted him to find out what happened to him (for my work experience I worked with him and we'd text each other, easier since the school was on two sites and they were both huge, so it wasn't weird).

Telling kids not to do things like that isnt the way to go. It seriously socially stunts them if they're scared into it. I remember hiding up a tree when some kid tried to give me a cigarette.

When I was 17, I started getting more work, I needed more time to finish. Homework couldn't be finished in 30 minutes anymore. I was taking two courses that took up a lot of time along with three others for my A levels. My mum would get home and start screaming at me, making up the most random things to be mad at me over. She would even hit me over these imaginary things. I was just trying to do my schoolwork, as she was accusing me of being kicked out???

I then asked for a later bedtime as I had no time to work in the evening as I had training and on the weekends I had work. Nope. I had to be in bed asleep at 9pm and up at 8am the next day. I asked nicely, stating reasons. I thought i was being reasonable since I was stuck in a dark room, awake for at least 2 hours a day, three most days. Nope. It became a hige deal with me just trying to work and her losing it. She said the most awful things. She trashed my room and my schoolwork, she hit, she took stuff away from me, she screamed, said some really awful things, all because I wanted to continue to silently work in my bedroom. My grades were tanking because I couldn't keep up. I had 30 minutes a day to do five classes of coursework. I was working straight through break, lunch and my free periods in school, but its hard to focus in a place where you've got to be alert all the time against bullies. 

How was it resolved. I told a teacher what was going on. She actually believed me, it went to the head of year and it was the first time she was called in. Took two call ins and some threats but I was able to finally have time to work. She didn't talk to me for a few months. I was even allowed to wash again. My grades recovered a bit and I eventually pulled a B, but it was too little too late. 

Also, I told my mum I was going to uni three hours away while she was at work so she couldn't hit or scream at me over it. I luckily went away the next day with my karate class for a weekend seminar and got my black belt, so she had a good few days to chill out. She still threatened to kill herself if I left and tried to make me stay with the promise of a car."
