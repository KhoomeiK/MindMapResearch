However, at this point her career has brought her to a place where she can afford the best trainers, nutritionists, therapists, or pharmaceutical intervention available. If she isn't doing that because she feels her career relies on her image as the voice for fat shaming, we're all to blame for her inevitable early death.

Edit: if you look at this broads shoulders though, she big. She can carry more fat than most. While she is assuredly obese, it may not be as damaging as it would be on a person with a weaker frame. I'm not linking any research. It's out there"
