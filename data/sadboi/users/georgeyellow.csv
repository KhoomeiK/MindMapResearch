tbh, i’m shocked every day lmao. i don’t know how i’ve done it. but it’s possible! time management is a skill i would recommend investing heavily in. also a piece of advice i was given is: the first two weeks are the most important of your college career. 

meaning, the way you choose to prioritize school/homework (or not) in the first two weeks will hugely influence your school moving forward. also good advice for habits in general. 

the first 2 weeks will be a lot probably, but as long as mentally you invest in yourself and your schooling, it will set a really good tone for your academics moving forward. 

advice really depends a lot on your personality and your direction in school. i barely scraped by in HS with C/D/F’s, and am entering my 3rd year in college with a 4.0... always believe in your ability to perform well and differently than in the past. and if i can ever offer any more specific help/tips, please let me know! i love school and love to help people with it, so please reach out :) 

that’s my last tip — take advantage of the resources you have available. in friends, family, and your school. most colleges have tons of resources for students in any department, and i’d recommend using them."

also nothing wrong with p/f! i don’t know about you, but my uni changed the rules and deadlines a bit to make that more accessible. i definitely considered it, and it is a wise decision if the grades call for it! good job finishing regardless, im proud of you!"

Art,fqihhul,t1_fqi46yt,1589396062.0,"i’m not “demanding” anything. i encouraged the original commenter to maybe offer something more fruitful than a rude and empty jab. my response to u/twistedfantasy15’s comment was not dismissive, in my opinion. rather, i do not have the time or the energy to analyze each and every comment i receive on reddit (and i had just woken up!). i feel that offering context as to why i made the decisions that i did in my artwork is not dismissive, and it makes sense. this is my artwork, someone commented on it, and i replied giving my perspective.

i welcome and value constructive criticism tremendously. that doesn’t mean i am “demanding” or that i have the time to reply to all criticism i receive in a way you deem satisfactory."

Art,fqi1906,t1_fqgzygb,1589388095.0,"i’ll share another comment i made here:


“lots of people talking shit about the angst in the comments, but in reality, the edgy and angsty part of my brain will always exist and i don’t think there’s anything wrong with expressing that exactly as it is — angry, juvenile, immature, messy, whatever. that’s how it felt, so that’s how i wrote it.”

if you don’t like it, that’s also fine. a helpful tool you might look into, though, is constructive criticism. saying someone’s very personal art looks like “pubes shaved over bad poetry” is doing nothing for anyone but yourself. it isn’t beneficial feedback, it’s just rude. 

of course you have the right to be rude all you want on random people’s artworks. but i hope you can at least find a way to work a microscopic amount of constructive criticism in there once in a while."
