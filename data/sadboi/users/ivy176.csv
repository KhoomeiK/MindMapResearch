PurplePillDebate,fr58xfb,t3_gmqwip,1589904563.0,My partner and I are only interested in sex within a relationship so neither of us would be interested in sex dolls
PurplePillDebate,fqzhatc,t1_fqylsiv,1589767366.0,"My personal worst experience was with my ex husband who was American and got into anti woman type stuff like red pill and toxic stuff posing as men's rights. He had massive victim complex and felt wronged by women (mother, sister, exes, myself) and had serious issues in general (along with being sexist, he was racist, violent, financially dependent on me, very lazy). 

I definitely don't experience the level or type of sexism I see on reddit in my real life, but I experience issues in life related to my gender.

Most men here date and marry women around the same age as them. A 10 year age gap if bith are over 30 won't be shocking to people but it's a bit unusual. A lot of men that gender subs on reddit attract go on about only wanting 20 year old women, defend it with okcupid data from back in the day (yeah, it was like a hookup site, not a balanced sample of men there) and just ""natural biology"". But I've only ever seen men say they want to date women 15-20 years younger on reddit. My ex was an asshole and had immature asshole friends who still partied and were in bands and their love/sex interests were all similar age to them. My partners have always said it'd be embarrassing to be with someone young enough to be your kid and that very young people are immature/off putting and seem like kids by the time you're 30-35. So that's definitely only a reddit thing in my life.

I work with a lot of men. I find they are lazier on average and majorly avoid cleaning which is part of our job. Time management is often poor. They can rush and focus on only the biggest main tasks, if they want to go home early. But they don't do a good job when they get their ass into gear and they leave loads of work for me because they can't multitask or be speedy AND thorough. That's my experience. Most of my bosses are women and they tend to let men get away with being lazier. The women in this job have more unpaid responsibilities that we aren't recognised for, then the men are given a pat on the back if they have to take over just 1 of my responsibilities. I'm on leave from work and my responsibilities were delegated between 5 men while I'm gone. 

We certainly have that ""women get everything in divorce"" attitude here, which isn't accurate for myself or any woman in my circle. 

I haven't noticed an attitude from men of denying rape or focusing on false accusations, or saying false accusation is as bad as or worse than rape. We had some higher profile attacks in my city, one example being Jill Meagher who was raped and killed on the street when she was walking home. Another was Eurydice Dixon who was also raped and murdered on her way home. Eurydice was a comedian who spoke about gender and was viewed as a feminist so that brought a lot of assholes out of the woodwork, one being some incel blogger who drew a huge penis on her memorial site. So they're there.. but they tend to be hidden away online and won't say anything in public. 

We also don't have that Anerican ""college culture"" here as it's normal to commute to university, some unis don't have accommodation and the ones that do, it's mainly international students who are focused on study. So we don't have frat houses/sororities or any of that. 

There are a lot of issues within intimate relationships. These days, in Australia, a lot of men want to have their cake and eat it too. They want everything 50/50, but if she earns more money then they think she should pay a lot more. But within 50/50, they still expect the woman to do far more house work or be the main care taker of the kids. My experience here is mostly that women will often just go along with doing more work and contributing more, especially in their first or second marriage/big relationship. 

It's a pretty liberal and modern country with far less religious influence than the US, so 50/50 or women being bread winners is commonplace. Australia is also all about being ""easy going"" so a lot of men expect women to put up with their shit whether it's in a relationship or simply being drunk and sleazing onto her in a pub/bar/club. 

There's a lot of inappropriate behaviour in clubs, but I don't go to those places. 

Australia has a big drinking culture and binge drinking on weekends is considered normal to many people. Men can act very inappropriately when drunk and they think everyone's supposed to just think ""oh well, he was drunk, not his fault"". A lot of men get argumentative and aggressive when drunk. 

But that's just my experience in city/suburbia. Very rural country areas can be SOOOOOOOO much worse. There are pubs in mining towns and other male dominated towns and they specifically hire women to leer at, sexually harass and treat like dirt. But bar tenders are treated like shit even in the cities in ordinary bars too. Drunk men are assholes. 

There's a documentary called Hotel Coolgardie which gives an example of these types of towns. Misogynists, no respect, no manners, very threatening, sex obsessed and permanently drunk Hills Have Eyes type men."

PurplePillDebate,fqvijo5,t1_fqu92of,1589678022.0,"Domestic violence laws actually include verbal abuse in some states. But I'm personally speaking specifically of physical violence in my post, like blocking access, restraint, pushing, shoving, slapping, punching, throwing objects at people, destroying property, using weapons obviously, etc (when it is not genuine self defence). 

Sexual abuse would obviously be acts of assault or rape. But in terms of family violence, it can be more of an ""invisible"" issue. For example, in my state, sexual abuse in a relationship or marriage was defined as ""indecent behaviour to the other person without consent"" which minimizes the assault to more like an inappropriate behaviour rather than rape. I'd say most people would agree spouses can sexually assault or rape each other, but it wouldn't be looked upon like being raped by someone you're not in a relationship with, in general. I don't agree with that, but that is how it'd be viewed by plenty of people.

In my view, sexual abuse in a relationship would also include, without consent, trying to coerce someone to do certain acts or giving punishment if they refuse. Removing condoms without asking and without consent. Deliberate damage to condoms without the other person being aware. Lying about being on birth control. Lying about not having STIs. Cheating on a partner and then giving your partner an STI. People could sleep around even with a condom, likely get HPV or herpes as condoms don't protect against them, then give it to partner. Not only that, but disgusting people do it without even a condom as well. No one would be tested for genital herpes unless they had a lesion and got it swabbed, and men won't be tested for HPV at all. Then there are other STIs that take weeks to be tested for, so even if someone got tested afterwards, it's still quite likely they can pass on an STI. I don't know exactly how laws work with these things though. 

Generally, a lot of things are used to support protection orders and not necessarily convicted offences. 

Financial abuse:

 ""5.31 Only some jurisdictions include ‘economic abuse’ in their definition of family violence—namely Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory.

5.32 There are some differences in the precise formulations of economic abuse. It may include, for example:

unreasonable controlling behaviour without consent that denies a person financial autonomy; withholding financial support reasonably necessary for the maintenance of a partner; coercing a partner to relinquish control over assets; unreasonably preventing a person from taking part in decisions over household expenditure or the disposition of joint property; coercing the person to claim social security payments; and preventing the person from seeking or keeping employment.[39]""

In my case, financial abuse was my ex refusing to work for many years and spending my money without permission. I could not support him long term on my wage and didn't agree for him to be dependent on me, he provided no type of domestic labour whatsoever and he found my credit cards and would record the numbers so he could buy things online without asking me.

Emotional and psychological abuse: 

""5.37 Both the Victorian and South Australian family violence legislation defines emotional or psychological abuse as well as giving examples of such abuse. The Victorian family violence legislation defines emotional or psychological abuse as behaviour that ‘torments, intimidates, harasses or is offensive’.[48]Examples of such behaviour include racial taunts, threatening to disclose a person’s sexual orientation or to commit suicide, preventing a person from keeping family and cultural connections, and threatening to withhold a person’s medication.[49] The South Australian family violence legislation defines emotional or psychological harm as including mental illness, nervous shock, and distress, anxiety or fear that is more than trivial.[50]Examples of such conduct include threatening to institutionalise the person and threatening to withdraw care on which the person is dependent.[51]

5.38 In contrast, Western Australian family violence legislation includes ‘emotionally abusive conduct’, but neither defines nor gives examples of such conduct.[52]

5.39 Emotional abuse or intimidation under the Tasmanian legislation is defined as the pursuit of ‘a course of conduct that he or she knows, or ought to know, is likely to have the effect of unreasonably controlling or intimidating, or causing mental harm, apprehension or fear, in his or her spouse’.[53]

5.40 Other legislation refers to conduct that is intimidating,[54]harassing[55] or offensive.[56]Intimidation is defined variously to include conduct that: causes reasonable apprehension or fear;[57] a reasonable apprehension of injury[58] or violence to the person or the person’s property;[59]has the effect of unreasonably controlling the person or causing mental harm;[60] causes physical harm;[61] prevents the person from doing any act that the person is lawfully entitled to do or compels the person to do an act that the person is legally entitled to abstain from;[62] and conduct that amounts to harassment or molestation.[63] Intimidation is usually included either as a subcategory of emotional abuse or as a ground of family violence in its own right. Similarly, in some cases harassment and offensive behaviour are treated as subcategories of emotional abuse or of intimidation, while in other cases they form an aspect of family violence in their own right.""

I'd say most people would generally view verbal/psychological/emotional abuse as name calling, shouting at, swearing at - particularly if it systematic or regular behaviour. I mean if my voice gets a bit louder during an argument because I'm frustrated and the person's talking over me then I don't view that as ""abuse"" even though it's negative. But if I was to just start yelling at my partner or calling him names, saying fuck you etc etc, that would be abusive to me. Obviously threatening people would be commonly viewed as abusive, in terms of threatening harm, to damage property, to take someones property away, to take necessary things away that the person is entitled to, to take away pets or children where there has been no abuse to warrant attempting to take them away... 

For me, personally, I think being highly manipulative is psychological abuse. For example, gaslighting, trying to convince a person they're crazy when they speak the truth or try to find resolution. Completely denying things that happened (like hitting somebody, or spending money without permission). 

There are also separate categories for stalking, breaching protection orders, property damage and abuse of animals that all fall under family violence laws in various ways depending on state. Harm to pets falls under property damage in some states, but in others it can fall under more general family violence and emotional abuse."

I'm an aged care nurse in small facilities and it's soooooooooo SOOOOO cliquey.

I'm 33 but people seriously assume I'm like 25 and the worst experiences I've had are with women over 45. 

I think the issue is that people can start viewing their work as a second home (since we are working round the clock there) and get SO controlling and territorial.  It's a very women dominated industry where I live, but strangely enough, both sites I've worked at long term actually had more male staff because women sustained injuries at these intensive sites a lot faster. 

In this industry, at least where I am, there are quite a few women who either did a career change later in life to aged care, or they had kids and came back after a number of years. I'm a childfree woman and pretty much any woman I've worked with had kids and a lot of them judge me HARD. I worked with many ex school teachers and previous SAHMs and I can honestly say that a huge chunk of them looked down on me. For example, they would act shocked and dismissive if I said I was previously married for nearly 10 years. They'd laugh and say ""what, did you get married at 12? What are you talking about?"". When I explained my age and people came to accept me as a 32 year old woman (they assumed I was 25 or under for some reason), I got weird comments like ""Well, you're divorced.... so.""... because they were still married (and miserably).

I know FDS is so much about building up other women and I'm sooo for that, but there are such rude nasty women in certain women dominated industries and I just have to say it!! 

In aged care, there can be things like cooking, cleaning, laundry, and of course taking care of people. Some women can be so controlling about these things, and I don't mean offence to moms because I'm just talking about my personal work experience but they were all moms and seemed to not be able to get out if authoritarian mom mode at work. They treated me like a child and I absolutely hated work when I temporarily went casual and had to deal with them. Like you, I stayed quiet but I got judged for that too.

I tend to get along easier with men in this industry BUT that's because they're often not as controlling BECAUSE they have a more ""whatever"" attitude. I find the men are absolutely hopeless with cleaning and time management and I do far more work on shufts with them. So it's less conflict in one way, but more stress in another way. 

I work with a couple of women who I get along with really well. Neither of them have kids and they're not egotistical or controlling. They can be assertive if something's not right, but they don't berate someone over how they folded a napkin or criticise the way you mash potatoes.

In my country, this is not a minimum wage job. My base rate is good and the penalty rates for certain shifts are BIG. So I won't let conflict push me out of my job. 

I found in this situation, it's best to just be yourself. Say what you think, do what you think is right. These people are so self absorbed that they won't really notice. I'm a passive person, but I found when I stood up to these types, they either just said nothing or treated me a bit better.

As for making friends.. it'll either happen or it won't. Just be your kind hearted self but don't be a doormat. If people like you, they'll gravitate. If they're snooty, they won't. But ask yourself honestly, do you really wanna fit in with people that aren't welcoming?"

You're at an age where it's a common time to start truly questioning the decisions you made and the relationships you built or fell into in your teens and 20s. 

You have to think about where you want to be in life and if your spouse looks like a likely part of that. I'm sure you want a loving partner and a good father to your child, but sometimes that just can't happen with the person you hoped it would. 

I wish you all the best in your future, congratulations on your recovery. Don't let someone else drag you down

Addicts can't fully recover being around other active addicts. You need to get to the root cause of what contributed to your addiction and why you stay with an addict. Stopping one or 2 substances doesn't necessarily fix the root cause or the urge, as you can see with your partner. If he keeps doing any kind of substance like that, you probably will too.

Dating a man in my financial league isn't having a ""bread winner"". Having a breadwinner means that they pay my bills and I am not independent.

For FDS women, offering to pay is the chivalrous gesture. 

Now I can't speak for all FDS women, it's made up of 70k+ women who have different viewpoints. But if I was on a date and the man didn't OFFER to pay or he suggested to pay half... do you think I would argue with him and say ""No! You're the man! You asked me out! You pay for 100%!!!!"". Nope, I will pay. Also, if a man pauses and doesn't say he's got it and won't say anything at all, I'd just pay half. I'm not interested in forcing a man to be something he's not. 

But I'm looking for something more traditional. I can pay half (or ALL) but I don't have to see him again if he's not my type. I don't DEMAND a man to pay. I just don't want to date men who want to go dutch because a) I've financially supported a man for 5 years and lack of financial stability and effort are red flags and b) I want traditional chivalry. 

If a man was fully supporting me then I would do all the housework, cooking etc. I expected the same of my ex husband who was unemployed and fully supported by me when I was only earning THIRTY KAY (that was more towards poverty for ""first world"" stabdards but I still managed for a while) but he couldn't even do the dishes or mow the lawn. 

I have never ever had a man financially support me as a bread winner. I was the bread winner though. Half my entire pay went to rent, I'd get paid twice a month and one pay went over 100% to rent. My fiance does more for me than any man has but it's not a LOSS for him, he's just not GAINING off me significantly in any financial way. For example, he could rent a room out in his house and get cash from it. But that would a) affect his tax negatively, b) reduce his privacy and freedom in a way he doesn't want, and c) not result in having his home clean and his meals cooked like I do. A room mate and a fiance are very different - he wants to share our home with me and feels comfortable doing things in front of me that he wouldn't with a room mate, like walking naked to the laundry to get clean underwear or singing loudly, whatever. A room mate most likely wouldn't cook for him or clean or organize things to the level that I do because they're not invested in him or the home like I am as his life partner. I will be going on the title/deed of the mortgage so I do things that affect the long term value of the home that a random renter would not. 

He vetted me just like I vetted him. I want certain things and so does he. We BOTH liked traditional roles so yes, I do most cooking and more of the cleaning. He doesn't demand that of me whatsoever but he LIKES it. I don't demand he does anything but I LIKE it. I didn't demand that he paid for dates but did I have to continue dating him if he didn't? NO. Just like a man doesn't HAVE TO keep dating me when I say I don't have sex until we're in a fully committed relationship and looking towards marriage. Nobody HAS TO do anything, but they should be honest about their desires and intentions. 

Yes there are some women on FDS who want very wealthy men, but the thing is a lot of those wonen are wealthy!! If a woman is broke and looking for a rich partner, well she can legally do that but is it a good idea? Not often. The dynamic would be so out of balance and the man would hold too much power. I'd recommend she gains more financial independence first and keeps certain things separate and so would a lot of FDS veterans. It's NOT meant to be a sugarbaby sub no matter if there are young newbies there who want a meal ticket or not. 

Now that's not to say a good man who's wealthy can't fall for a woman who has barely any money and they can't have a loving healthy relationship. But people do tend to date and marry within their ""level"" when it comes to looks, fitness, lifestyle, finances etc. It's okay if a wonan would prefer to be with a wealthy man, just like many men would prefer and seek out a woman who had a particular body type, personality, hair colour/type, or anything else. It's just not the be all and end all and women shouldn't overlook other qualities and issues because he's wealthy.

I rejected a yuppie life. My father is in a house that's worth 2.5 million dollars and I've done all the dinner parties and endlessly congratulated women on their engagement to lawyer cheating assholes and said how beautiful their 5 carat rings are. I've worked inner city and liased with high profile businessmen and celebrities who will sleaze onto anything that looks female, slim and under 27. They'll try to hit you up on snapchat even if they're married with 3 kids. 

I live my own life and am proud of my independently earned 55k. I don't give a shit if a man is wealthy or what university he went to or what his job title is or if he has a membership to that country club or that yacht club. Yes it's nice to not have money worries and to be able to have really nice things. In a perfect world, would I prefer my partner earned 500k? Yeah, so long as he wasn't a snob and didn't spend most of his time at work or talking about work and money and isn't a controlling asshole. But that's soooooooo beyond fucking unlikely. I'll happily take a man who is financially stable, independent, achieving goals, has assets. Also who has life experience beyond being at the best private all-boys schools and the best universities and scoff at people who earn 55k a year. A bunch of those guys don't even know how to change a tap washer or change a tyre. I am not into that and many women who think they're into that haven't even regularly socialised with these guys. 

But despite the fact that I am not into really wealthy men, they are a huge turn off for me, I only continue dating a man who pays for dates during courting. It's not about money and I don't DEMAND any man pays for me. But it's about my preference and the GESTURE. Just like he mentioned in the video from his own perspective as a YOUNG likely gen Z man who doesn't particularly want anything traditional. 

Many FDS women don't want traditional roles in all ways, but they earn plenty of money and don't enjoy cooking or don't want kids. They still want the man to offer and pay, for the gesture, because the less slutty and more serious guys offer to pay more often. They also tend to be less anti woman with less hangups. It's not about needing a ""free meal"". 

It's ok to vet to your preferences, men do it all the time. 

If a woman is broke and doesn't like domestic labour or cooking, but she wants a really wealthy man to support her... well, she can want that. But it will put her in a vulnerable position as a dependent which opens her up to lack of autonomy and freedom. So we would not recommend that at FDS even if we were only thinking of the woman's perspective. 

But like I said, a man doesn't have to be wealthy to pay for dates. I find the average ""working class folk"" men that you textually spat on to be more generous and chivalrous anyway."
PurplePillDebate,fqsx0t5,t1_fqsu7wf,1589621974.0,"Let's just say they actually asked questions without being a total karen.

Yes, there can be major downsides to dating someone from work. This is very individual and depends what industry you work in and how CLOSE you work together. If it's different departments or even different locations and you meet at work parties or events then that's less of an issue than if you work in the same tiny office.

I also said classes which makes up 50% of my basic examples of how people often have a prior history. Hobbies, friends of friends, there are many ways people could already know each other. 

People say the same thing about not dating someone in your group of friends but that happens a LOT too.

He highlighted my comment about already liking a man in question, implying that I am suggesting to be a mind reader, when I already listed ways to flirt which he didn't quote.

Men should assume a woman isn't interested unless she is flirting and suggesting. A woman can be subtle but it's still obvious that it's flirting. By ""subtle"" I meant I don't go ""Hello Daren. I'd like you to ask me out because I have some fluttery feelings in my stomach and vagina towards you and think you could be a potential for marriage in 3 years"". You know, a lot more subtle than that. But still clearly flirting."
PurplePillDebate,fqsws1q,t1_fqsw4b5,1589621710.0,"I never said a man has to pay $100, but a main meal here is like $30+ per meal. Unless you're taking a woman to McDonald's, but that's like pub meal cost. 

Excuse me but did you just say people shouldn't act like ""working class folk""?????????

I'd rather date a hard working blue collar man than some wealthy yuppie who looks down on people due to their income or ""class"" and sits on reddit being pissed off about women on a sub that he'll never meet. 

I can't believe you're so salty towards some random FDS sugarbaby newbies when you're a total snob.

If you would struggle to live on 55k and be ""poverty"" level then it's not such a wild assumption to assume you're not frugal.

Men on incomes that you deem as ""poverty"" have been more generous than wealthy men in my experience, and that is exactly what I tell some 19 year old newbie sugababes on FDS. Wealth does not equal high value man.

I used to work in a high profile place that deals with a lot of very wealthy people and highlights their yuppiness and shallowness more than any other industry. I left that job despite it being nearly 6 figures because I can't fucking STAND snobs."
PurplePillDebate,fqswhjn,t1_fqsukpt,1589621400.0,"I only used the first example because I met my fiance at work. A lot of people meet their spouse at work. It's not exactly ideal but it happens for a lot of people since we spend a lot of our time and often meet the most people through work. 

It definitely has cons and is not even allowed in some places, but it still happens. I wasn't suggesting that it's the best place to find someone, I was saying I personally only date men I already know, and that has happened to me with a work partner."
PurplePillDebate,fqsw9xt,t1_fqsu7wf,1589621175.0,"They said the man needs to be a ""mind reader"" when I said to flirt. 

Am I supposed to be a mind reader and assume this person is genuinely wanting to clarify or ask me things, or would one likely assume they're just a pissed off man who's cherry picking in order to attack and invalidate what I said?

People can ask questions directly if they want clarification.

I won't take sarcastic statements as questions."
PurplePillDebate,fqstqoa,t1_fqsss6j,1589618530.0,"But I'm not including general politeness that men mistake for interest. 

I'm talking about flirting. If someone can't tell the difference between just a smile and saying thanks or how are you, or politely laughing at a joke or having a basic conversation...  and someone being actually interested by making certain remarks, flirty body language or saying subtly suggestive things then that's not the woman's doing."
PurplePillDebate,fqst6dl,t1_fqsrsfl,1589617964.0,"You just ignore everything I say and say ""nuh uh"". I've repeated myself saying there's an FDS level up sub and that we have terms for low value women. 

I live in a high cost of living area but that doesn't mean I must earn a high wage otherwise live in ""poverty"". I made wise decisions. I am independent. I could earn over 90k if I worked full time but I have health issues that prevent that. 

Yes, there are plenty of ways I've saved money. You're pretty judgemental if you view $4600/month as poverty, especially if you're in the US. I had a room mate before I was with my partner. I paid $1200 a month as my share of the rent. That leaves 3400 per week to pay some minor bills, eat, save money. 

If you choose to rent inner city, refuse to commute at all and spend money on things that break the bank then that's somebody's choice. But these things are not necessities and doesn't mean someone on 55k is ""poor"". Sounds like you're far more judgemental about money than me, and perhaps not very good with money. My partner was only earning 12k more per year than me when we got together. We're now similar as he dropped some hours to also work on a business. 

He was able to save a house deposit and buy on his own. This place is small and worth 600k. He bought at a wise time and had a large deposit. 

I have more in my savings account than what I earn per year. 

FDS isn't about ""simply"" not dating men who are abusive. Why would you think our standards need to be so basic? There are lots of things we have preferences with, as we should.

A lot of FDS women earn way more money than me. I don't think a woman who earns 150k+ needs a ""bread winner"". But even those of us who earn a lot less - I don't live in poverty. I do most realistic things I want in life and don't ever feel short of money or struggle to pay for things. I spend $100-200/week on food and drinks per week easily and that's not including my groceries. 

Paying for dates doesn't equal bread winner. My partner doesn't earn much more than me. I chose someone who's financially compatible with me and whose lifestyle is compatible. He is great at saving and makes wise decisions and is independent, like me."
PurplePillDebate,fqsmqpe,t1_fqsmh9w,1589611805.0,I said repeatedly to make it obvious and listed ways to flirt so you are cherry picking
PurplePillDebate,fqsi6q3,t3_gkl0nh,1589607957.0,"I don't want random guys approaching me at all, but I don't go to places where getting ""hit on"" is considered commonplace, like bars or clubs. 

Women tend not to want to be approached if they're doing things like running errands, grocery shopping or exercising. I've had VERY terrifying experiences of harassment in those situations, way beyond ""creepy"" but actually very threatening where I ran for my life and was followed. 

Men know that approaching women can be threatening, so many feel uncomfortable to do it. 

I only want a man to make the move of asking me out if we have prior history and I already know him (and like him of course). Maybe we work together or both do some kind of class together, etc. But I'm quite ""old fashioned"" and as I said, never go to bars and I've never used a dating app. 

But it's difficult for women because even though many guys can be creepy, she will fancy some guys and wish they'd ask her out. They may be more traditional women and not want to ask a guy out. I wouldn't ask a guy out, that's my personal preference. But I'll show him I'm interested in other ways to make it kind of obvious that he can ask me out. My mentality is if he doesn't ask me despite me flirting and showing I'm interested, then it's not meant to be, he's not my type and doesn't want to pursue me. I don't want to pursue a man in the early courtship phase, I don't want to take the dominant position and ""woo"" him in that way, and that's okay. But if I like a guy then I have to show him that. I don't have to pursue him in a traditional sense, but I have to show him that I'm interested and make him feel desired. I won't be the one to text furst or ask him out, but I will make sure he knows I'm liking his pursuit and that I'm liking a lot of things about him.  

I think it's ok to vent online that you wish a good guy would approach or pursue you, even if you're not willing to pursue. It's okay to want things a certain way and be disappointed that you don't have it. You shouldn't have to change your standards. But it shouldn't make you really miserable or distract from the rest of your life. Venting is ok though, we all gotta vent sometimes and finding a connection no matter how sloppy and pathetic your standards could be is hard.

I don't think throwing your traditional desires to the wind is a good strategy for finding a partner if that's who you truly are. If you want a guy to pursue you then that's understandable. But we women have our own methods of seduction and you have to use them. If you sit there looking miserable or don't talk to a guy or give short answers, or anything that shows you might not be interested then you have no chance. But if you keep the conversations flowing and do some subtle flirting, men pick up on that. You don't have to give much away, I never hit on a guy or say anything sexually suggestive, not even close. But there are hundreds of ways to flirt and show a guy you're interested.

I think for women, it's important to be direct when you are not interested.. but this can be hard if you feel cornered or threatened. Women are taught to be polite, passive and indirect in order to minimize threat of harm by men. We have to be careful but it's important to be as direct as you can, if safe to do so. Online? In a bar? At a coffee shop? At the supermarket? Tell him straight up that you're not interested. If it's a date, tell him at the end of the date  that you enjoyed the night (if he was a gentleman but you just didn't click, not if he was a negging asshole).. but you didn't feel that romantic type of connection. 

If it's a guy you're into, make sure you show him you're interested. If he chats about something, keep the conversation going. Find subtle ways to flirt that come more naturally to your style and personality. If he compliments you then throw a compliment towards him into another topic a few minutes later. Drop some hints. If he still doesn't make the move of asking you out when you've made it obvious, then he lacks what you want and unfortunately it's gotta be -  Next."
PurplePillDebate,fqs845s,t1_fqqpz0y,1589600666.0,"Cost of living is high where I live. I could afford $200/week for dates. I only expect a man to be in a similar position to me. Have assets, have savings, can support themselves and has disposable income, because that's what I have, and I earn what others in my area would consider a mediocre wage. It's not my wage amount that enabled me to have all of that, it's what I did with it and did with my life. I made sacrifices to have that. I expect the same from a man and he doesn't have to have a great wage to do it, because I'm on 55k net a year which is good for part time but nothing compared to what a lot of people here get for working full time. I know a lot of people on 90-150k a year. 80k is the ""median"" wage here. 

FDS doesn't recommend against ""pitching in"" to your own freaking life lol. If you're living with a man as a partnership then most will agree that you contribute. Different couples have different arrangements, for example child rearing, domestic labour, cooking etc are strong contributions, as well as working and contributing financially. In some cases, especially if the woman is a ""stay at home"" parent, the man will obviously provide the financial support in that case. But if there are no kids, usually both parties are working and both contribute. 

FDS advocates not being wifey to a guy you're just dating. It advocates not doing things that you'd do if you were a committed couple, if he's not yet committed. It also advocates men paying for dates during the courtship phase. Now there may be women whose husbands pay for dates for the rest of their lives, whatever works for them. But most of us view it differently when it comes to a life partnership/marriage because now your lives are combined. You should still have your own money, but you'll also have many combined purchases and things in your life..  so that's a totally separate arena to the DATING strategy. You're not dating anymore, you're living together or married. That's not a hot topic on FDS because those of us that are engaged/married are the minority but we're there to give our input. Most other women there are in courtship phase with a man or they're struggling to find one decent guy to even go on a 2nd date with, so the content is geared towards early courting and not so much towards living together or marriage. 

That's like going on red pill and assuming that even if a red pill man was married then he'll still be ""spinning plates"" and all that stupid crap. I'm not implying FDS is like red pill, but both sides of the spectrum have different recommendations and cultural attitudes towards DATING vs MARRIAGE. 

No, I don't live in the US. I live in a country where de facto relationships are valid in all states. You have rights to division of assets and your spouse's superannuation if you made significant financial or non financial contributions, if the relationship was 2 years or longer or if there was a child. Any one of those things, you don't have to meet them all. 

Yes, FDS promotes being high value and recognises some women are low value. That's why we have dedicated levelup subs and have certain terms for certain behaviour by women. Women don't want weak men or men that will be disadvantaged by paying for dates or whatever. You don't seem to get that we don't want men with money troubles to be taking us out. The man shouldn't even notice he's spending money on some dates, I wouldn't. It's not about the money, it's about the effort. As you can see, a lot of men here are very defensive and protective about anything money related. Money talks, to MEN. A man will only spend money on sonething he really wants. A man paying for dates shows his investment. 

Most women at FDS agree with a lot of what I say, that's why I'm an ""fds disciple"". I am not in the same position as much younger women who are using dating apps and need to be ruthless about vetting. I've never used a dating app and I'm engaged and live with my long term partner. My views aren't going to be identical to 22 year old American women. That doesn't mean any newbie represents FDS more than I do. We have a handbook and we all post our views. I am one of the people who posts about relationships and marriage. Many of the other ladies aren't at that stage yet. I also post about avoiding abusive relationships and things I have experience with.

Of course we want the upper hand while dating or during courtship. By upper hand, I mean we are making decisions and deciding whether we do or don't want something and we are not submitting to men we date. We don't want to get abused or assaulted in the process. There are so many men out there on the hunt to take things from women and don't care if they hurt them. We have to keep ourselves in a certain position for our safety. Also a lot of men like a woman who knows what she wants and who respects herself. Many men want to pay for dates. We don't want the ""upper hand"" in order to abuse men, and we wish we didn't NEED to have any upper hand. 

Yes there are many posts that are negative towards men on FDS, but so many women have been abused and we use a women only space to vent sometimes. People may say, well go do that on a domestic violence or sexual assault or relationships forum. But the things women experience in relationships are so minimized and the toxic ways in which men can behave with dating are insidious, manipulative and vague... you need to talk about it with other women who have been through it, and the best way to find that is a women only sub of everyday women.. because most women get treated like shit by men. If you only went to DV forums to talk about all of it, you'll be bombarded by men saying ""what about violence against men"", and ""That's not even bad, look what happened to me"" by women that are still in the thick of it and haven't processed their abuse at all. Sometimes women just want to vent about shitty dating experiences and shitty relationships to other women who will be sympathetic but level headed. DV forums tend not to be very empowering places and FDS women want to feel empowered. Sure we can focus on the negatives a lot, but dating has a lot of negatives for women and you have to acknowledge things in order to change them. 

The bottom line is that if you're in a serious relationship or married and you're past the courting stage, both people have to contribute. There are different ways to contribute, but both people should be benefiting from the relationship. FDS women LIKE high value men. If you're in a relationship with a high value man then you'll WANT to make him happy and he'll be making you happy. The issue is that people assume the way FDS women feel about NVM and LVM is how they'll feel about HVM. You have to remember that despite vetting, these women are still inadvertantly dating lots of low value men. So a lot of what is posted is about in fact dating low value men, and how to try not to. Those duscussions and vuews cannot apply to a marriage with a High value man."
PurplePillDebate,fqs4n0k,t1_fqr2ko8,1589598421.0,"It's a mystery to me... he did say that I was emasculating him a lot and he felt very strongly that he was a victim so I think that's what attracted him to it.

The confusing part is that the reason he accused me if emasculating him was that I would ask him after 4 years of unemployment if he could apply for some jobs. I'd ask him to please do the dishes or not let our pets defecate on the carpet while I was gone (let them outside) and I'd get frustrated that I'd come home after night shift and see the dishes were untouched and get my steam cleaner out to clean the piss and poop off the carpet. He'd say he ""forgot""  so I'd leave a 2 item list or text him to remind him and he said that was patronizing, emasculating and ""you're not my mother"" and not to do that. Then I'd get home and guess what? Wasn't done, not one thing. We'd then argue and if he was in a good mood because I bought him his favourite treats (sloppy unhealthy food, booze, weed) then he'd say ok, I understand why you left a list.. but I forgot to look at it. Or I read your text but I forgot it after. 

He demanded with his complete inaction and refusal to work that I be the bread winner and the housewife at the same time, but then he resented me for it and said he felt emasculated that he had no money. So I organised jobs for him through male friends or colleagues I had, like on their side hustles, but he wouldn't get off his computer or wake up in time to meet them. I thank God he didn't end up doing tgat now because I'm now engaged to one of those men lol. He did end up meeting him but refused the job, phew. I was upset at the time though. 

Basically, if I got home and seemed angry AT ALL that he did nothing, he'd use it as an excuse to have a full on shitshow of an argument and to be violent. I guess he expected me to quietly do absolutely everything for him? Anyway, that was his idea of being emasculated... fucking up your own life and another person's in a marriage, then getting upset if they have any problem with it. 

I didn't know he was in red pill and toxic stuff posing as mens rights or MGTOW until more recently. I had no clue that existed and just thought he was making up weird phrases to insult me with or bamboozle me with. He'd say ""female privelege"" a lot which is not a normal phrase to use here, I've only seen it on reddit and those types of forums. He'd say those weird things about men being accused of rape is worse than being raped. He'd use other unusual terms... I didn't pay attention because it was all mixed in with calling me a cunt whore and hitting me, so everything he did/said was just psychotic blahblahblah to me. But I guess it all sunk into my mind somewhere because now on red pill, mgtow and incel type subs, the toxic people may as well be my ex talking. 

I think a lot of it stemmed from his mother. His childhood wasn't fantastic but not as bad as he made out at all. He always said I had ""daddy issues"" but I think he had far bigger daddy AND mommy issues than me. His dad was out of the picture when he was a baby and his mom was a teenage single mother. He always felt his mom preferred his sister who was part african american/different father and so I think some of his anti woman and racist attitudes came from that."
PurplePillDebate,fqs2dof,t1_fqrfic2,1589596967.0,"I was just a normal person, I had anxiety and wasn't some beaming ray of sunshine. I wpuld get very stressed quite often, but then I also was very young and wanting to go on adventures and was fun as well. He had his buddies over a LOT and I was happy to party and drink with everyone.  

I found it hard to work full time and do university at 20 so he said it was ok if I stopped for a while to do uni and because my job was awful, low paying and with a bad boss. That was the one time he worked and he was the breadwinner for 1.5 years so he always said that justified me having to be the breadwinner for 5 years as I was in eternal debt to him. 

In the early days I was depressed and tired from traveling an hour to uni every day and an hour home and didn't do enough cleaning. I got another job once I caught up with a year of college and started working more and more. Been in that job for a decade now.

I was then depressed from being abused for so long. I was permanently exhausted from doing all the work (job and all housework while he had no job) and that never went away to this day. He was always inconsiderate to feelings, told me I was manipulative for crying when he hurt me even from pretty early on. But then it went from seeming inconsiderate sometimes to just calling me a cunt, bitch, stupid female etc. I didn't call him names much but I called him asshole etc if he hit me or whatever. Mainly I was always just pleading for him to wake up and care about what he was doing and treat me like a human and he found that really annoying and entitled. 

In the latter years, I yelled at him to get a job, help me with housework and stop abusing me. After he pushed me into a wall, I threw something at him because he was laughing at me being hurt. If I tried to defend myself while he was hurting me then he'd say I was the abuser. He would always say I attacked him first when I didn't, and that he defended himself. I could be standing there cooking or chopping vegetables, he'd attack me and then swear it was self defence as I was ""waving a knife"" even though I had my back to him and was doing a task. 

He would deny that he ever hit me. I bought into that manipulation and we'd be in 3 hour arguments if ne saying how can you deny what just happened, what is wrong with you. One time the argument went for so long that he just said fine, I did punch you a bunch of times, fine I admit it and here's the 10th one you whore and punched me in the face. At that point I never slept in the same room or associated much with him again. He seemed perplexed that he couldn't make me upset or fight with me after that, I'd just say hardly anything and if he called ne names or did anything, I just ignored it or said ok. That made him pissed off and he started giving ultimatums otherwise he's divorcing me. I said I'm done and agree with divorce like you're suggesting. He said fine. I spent the next month trying to kick him out with him begging for me to get back with him but then he'd switch to threatening to kill especially when I started dating someone else. He called that cheating and said I was going to hell for it. I kept saying I've told you for 2 months that we're separated and it's over, we both agreed on divorce. He just said nope. 

Anyway finally kicked him out and he banged some chick and got her pregnant from the hookup and she had the kid. 

It's normal to not list every negative thing about myself in a story of abuse because abusers use the fact that you're not perfect to justify abuse. And I don't see how it's relevant that I'm not an angel, because that implies that I need to be in order to not suffer domestic violence. It implies the man initiating domestic violence that was not self defence, is more understandable in some cases, if the woman's personality just isn't perfect enough. Unless you're implying that you suspect the entire thing is made up, which I would prefer to thinking violence against women is more understandable in some cases depending on how non-angelic she is.

But there are women who never even yelled or tried to defend themselves whatsoever who suffer domestic violence. That doesn't mean they deserve it less than someone who yells that it's not acceptable, tries to demand respect or tries to defend themselves. I mean what would people expect of someone who's been abused for 10 years? People wonder why women don't ""just leave"" but then their first response is ""hmm wonder what he actually did to deserve that though, bet she wasn't perfect"" instead of being troubled by the immense abuse that happened. That's why women don't often tell people, or report it, or press charges, or leave.. because they have their abuser in their ear saying they're a piece of shit person even worse than they are, then outsiders sitting there going ""Oh I just can't believe someone would do that for no valid reason tho"".

It's like if someone got murdered by a serial killer and people said ""You know I get really suspicious when they make out this person to be so innocent, the killer probably picked them for a reason"". People are fucked up. People target people. If normal life stress or a person being imperfect means a man resorts to violence then he is weak and evil imo. 

I'm the same imperfect person and I've been with someone else 4.5 years and he's never ever done anything like my ex did, not any name calling, not yelling at me or anything along those lines and I'm more fucked up and my personality is 70% worse now."
PurplePillDebate,fqp1vk0,t3_gjy9qg,1589532051.0,"I had a dead bedroom. We were incompatible, he was a bad person and became physically violent. He didn't work for years. But the relationship was crappy even before the serious abuse. He was well below my league and we just didn't go anywhere despite being married and being together for 12 years. 

In the earlier years, he would try for sex but he didn't really seduce me and would always verbally ask me to have sex. Neither of us wanted children but the responsibility of birth control was on me. That combined with another medication lowered my libido, but I just never had a good libido with him even before that. I thought it was ""just me"" and bought into the crap where men say sex isn't as important to women. I was really young and didn't know any better - with him at 16 and married at 20. 

We still had sex like once every 2 weeks maybe, but he just didn't turn me on and the actual sex wasn't good for me physically either. I was communicative, but his needs to pound somebody in order to cum due to having American circumcised deathgrip wasn't something communication could address. He also wanted foreplay I wasn't into and pressured me into it. If I wouldn't do it, he got angry and upset. He would say all other women like it and shame me for it. He saw nothing wrong with pressuring me because it was ""a favour to me"". Well, getting oral sex performed on me if I don't want it is not a favour to me. He wanted me to agree to it for him because it turned HIM on. But for me it's painful no matter how lightly anyone could do it. He didn't care what I might be into. Actually he freaked out when I suggested new things, he even freaked out when I wore a fantasy type outfit and said it made him feel ""pressured and inadequate"". He often sulked about sex.

In 12 years, he NEVER learned to touch my body in a way I like despite me being a very open, communicative and adventurous ""in bed"". He just could not turn me on. Sex was a total chore for me that I'd rather avoid, but I still did it and didn't act like it was a chore.

Until he started getting more emotionally abusive towards me and was getting into red pill and anti women forums, then he just stopped asking. I initiated sometimes because I felt guilty about it but he'd reject me. I was relieved, but it seemed weird at the same time. 

We just stopped having sex after a year or so of that. If I ever got drunk and tried to fool around (very occasional), he'd start insulting my body in ways he knew I was sensitive about and starting arguments about other things. He'd insult stuff that I had body dysmorphia aboout, but he was morbidly obese with bad hygiene.

By this point, he was very verbally abusive and he hadn't had a job for years (I was the bread winner) and he started becoming physically violent as well like pushing me into things and retraining me, pulling me put of the bed onto the floor etc.

The marriage was over for me and I had zero feelings for him so sex was totally irrelevant. It still happened very occasionally but pretty rare. I had to be really drunk. He was drunk and on drugs. 

Yet, I still stayed with him a solid 3 more years because ""vows"". I eventually did kick him out after he started punching me til I couldn't breathe and in my face. Pretty fucking stupid but when it builds up insidiously over 12 years, no one comprehends what can become normal to you. For me, it was so long term that I reacted to it like a normal person would to a minor argument. Upset, trying to reason with the person and help them see my point of view, why it's hurtful etc... it was like a reaction to arguing over buying a couch rather than being punched. I did have police attend and did seek help but no one could/would provide help beyond just telling me to leave and keep paying for him to stay at my house. 

So a bunch of crap happened and I eventually kicked him out. It took a while because of weird laws. People assume if someone abuses you, you can just kick them out if they're not paying to live there... but people actually have a lot more rights than you realise and police don't come running and drag them to jail like on TV. 

So I started dating another man after I separated from my ex. It was a man I'd known a very long time. Now I'm a part of FDS (oh noooo) but this was before FDS existed. I don't have sex with random people and never did, I wait months to have sex.

So we were dating and we were exclusive and committed, so I started having sex with him and I was shocked. I knew I had 100% more sexual feelings towards him before we did anything, I mean I was massively in lust with him but I figured it's all just new and I'm falling in love, so part of me figured sex would still just be meh and the anticipation was going to be more thrilling than actual sex. 

But the sex was great. His body just worked with mine automatically. I remember thinking ""Why does it feel tingly in there? I'm not even rubbing my clit.. what's happening? Is that an orgasm building up slowly? Nah I don't have penetration only orgasms. Hmm.. I think it could be?? Yes...""

Our relationship is so good and he seduces me. We were having sex 5x a day and it's pretty much all I thought about for 2 years. Of course things are less crazy now after 4.5 years but he still turns me on regularly and we both initiate. Also, his anatomy just works so much better for my body.

So yeah, that's my dead bedroom story. The relationship was dead, the man was dead, the bedroom was dead."
PurplePillDebate,fqorm6q,t1_fqoio9q,1589522822.0,"Most women I know do the 50/50 split when dating and even after they're married. 

I've supported my ex for 5 years so I can't really relate to complaining about paying ""a bit more"" whatever that means, but it's good to be in a relationship now where we both benefit. It's necessary for me that a man has decent financial status - and by that I mean he has some assets, savings and doesn't need additional help.. I'm not talking about being wealthy, this is achievable on average incomes as my fiance and I are both very average, actually below the median Australian income. I have all of those things so I expect the same from a man. 

If some FDS women want men who are wealthier than I expect, they are allowed to do that, just like men are allowed to only date women who aren't overweight or who have stable income or are a certain age range or whatever people's preferences are. Plus some FDS women are wealthy themselves, there are some higher profile people there as well. 

I don't define what other women should accept, if they have different standards to me then it doesn't mean that's wrong. We're all at different levels and want different things, but the overall recommendations regarding money would be (in my personal words, not quoting handbook):

During courtship, he pays for the dates. It's a weeding out strategy. Also, we don't ask men out so it's simply polite to pay when you invite someone to something. I'd do that for another woman, friends or family. 

He must be at least financially stable.

You must also be financially stable. Your career, your finances, your independence and life as a woman are non negotiable. 

We do NOT advocate sugarbaby lifestyle. It's dangerous for the woman for a start, plus it's bad for your own development. It's sad for the man but a lot of sugar daddies are shallow users too."
PurplePillDebate,fqoqmht,t1_fqoj847,1589522018.0,"So could my fiance and he never did. We worked together and I saw how many women he rejected at work.. a lot. Plenty of men don't value it either. And I don't think it's hard for men to get casual sex if they have low standards, same for women."

PurplePillDebate,fqopzrj,t1_fqom7pd,1589521513.0,"$100 a week is affordable for people on normal wages, without kids and other issues. If you struggle with $100 then you're close to broke.

It's not broke or breadwinner. Breadwinner is supporting a partner or household, not paying for dates. 

How could ""we both pay the bills"" mean he pays all the bills? He pays his mortgage and some of the bills. I pay some of the bills and I buy food/groceries more often. I do pretty much all of the cooking. He helps with cleaning but I do a majority.

I don't pay towards his mortgage since I'm not yet on the title. We haven't had time to do that with all the pandemic stuff, but once I'm on the title then we have a plan for refinancing and also both putting in a lump sum. I don't pay him ""rent"" as he views it as I'm his fiance and not a room mate, and that I contribute in other ways financially and in domestic labour. But like I said, we have plans for me to go on the mortgage. As it stands now, I'm his defacto and have rights to be paid out if we were to break up, but we have discussed what we would do in that situation if anything bizarre was to happen.

Right now, we both gain. We both gain a partner. He gains a clean house and cooked meals. I am not gaining that, as I am expending the effort to do that, but I gain essentially ""rent free"" living if you wanted to look at it that way. He loses nothing by having me in his home ""rent free"" because I am his partner, he wants me there and doesn't need anyone to help pay his mortgage that he already had on his own. We split the bills pretty fairly but he has some additional personal things he pays for, so he's not losing out on utilities or any costs. We both save more money, me because I'm not paying rent and him because he orders far less takeout, doesn't regularly pay for groceries and doesn't need a cleaner. It's a win-win situation. That's the whole point of a couple combining their lives. If it's win-lose or lose-lose then it's bullshit. 

Then in the future, we both continue to gain even if things change. I go on the mortgage title which increases some risk for him and myself, but he gains my lump sum and increased payments from me, reducing interest and paying it off much faster, resulting in more equity as house prices here dramatically increase long term, and I gain more security in the joint asset that I'll be significantly contributing to.

I'm not typing this to justify but just to show people what some FDS women are actually doing when living with a partner/married. It's a separate topic to dating strategy and listing specifics is the only way I can demonstrate how things work for some of us post-courtship."

PurplePillDebate,fqogoti,t1_fqofzfm,1589514835.0,"Plenty of them mind and plenty of men are looking for resources from women like a warm place to crash or their bills to be paid while following their pipedreams.

The gen Y musicians, artists, wannabe entrepreneurs know they need someone to support them because they don't have the stamina to work and study or work and grow their business or side hustle. They're still stuck in 2000 saying rock is dead and their parents say their ass is too old to keep staying in their basement, so they consciously or subconsciously hunt for a woman who can ""support their dreams"" and ""be their cheerleader"" and ""be so different to the rest"" aka let me stay for free while I act like pursuing my hobbies is a business in the making.

They might even get some crappy low paying or part time job if they're *really* top notch dudes and really killin it. Or they pay her a bit of rent with their dole payment, which is practically like a wage and not a handout, because he's had tough times in his life, like his parents got divorced when he was a kid, so the government is there to help guys like him who are in very genuine need due to such difficult circumstances. Besides, she'd have the house even if he wasn't there, he's only helping her out even more by contributing anything, it's not like it can impact her negatively. Moving forward together isn't like a *necessary* thing. Staying in the same place and not making her wealthier by joining together as a team is normal. I mean she'd be a gold digger if she expects that they'd be financially better off by coupling.

Depression is rough too. Not too
rough enough to stop him hanging out with some highschool buddies or to do his hobby, but I mean that's networking and business, just cause something's fun or not making money (YET) does not mean he's a lazy bum doing whatever he wants!!!!

They are selling the house and splitting things somewhat fairly but it can't be fair because she has been paying more of the cost of living for 10 years.

I have also been in the court system due to domestic violence and nobody favoured me at any stage and he was not convicted of anything. So I just paid for the divorce application and gave him thousands of dollars cash to bribe him to get out of my house because I couldn't legally kick him out due to squatter rights and lack of proof of domestic violence happening at the current time.
