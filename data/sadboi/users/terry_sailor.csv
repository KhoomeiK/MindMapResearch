They don’t want to be eco friendly, they want you to think they do"
politics,eyqew2s,t1_eypzwqy,1567340400.0,"Yeah, trump lies, so does every other politician. It’s kinda their thing, see how I’m celebrating the fact that he’s not lying? I’m not a trump supporter though, thx for assuming, I’m just an open minded human being wanting more freedom than these people “allow” me to have, by this point I’ve also obviously realized that trump is yet another politician stand-in being used to distract us from the declassified info, whys it declassified by the way?? Oh cuz they tell us we can’t know, as a free thinking human being I shouldn’t still have to watch who’s feelings I’m hurting and fight for what is best for the people. An uprising perhaps?? Then they can’t hide this crazy shit from us and tax us out our assholes, I should not have to be a part of this but because I was born in a country, I owe them something? Think about it, I deserve to know where my money is going, I deserve to know everything they desperately try to hide, why on earth shouldn’t I be? Because I was born in a position of submission, I’m the little guy to their big guy, they could take trump out tomorrow, make it look like an accident and use his death to push whatever they want to push in the media, it’s strange how dystopian this is becoming."

What’s going on in other countries, withholding information is a method to keep us down, if they admitted tomorrow that why’ve been lying the whole time, about everything, the masses would show up to their stupid low-paid high-taxed jobs because, “gotta make money!!” Omg"
