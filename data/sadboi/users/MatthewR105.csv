There are so many unexpected and possibly worrying symptoms you can get from taking T.  I've had a decent amount of changes in the 5 weeks I've been on it and while I love most of them, there is one that is somewhat worrying. I've bled once since starting, but now am having a consistent light bleeding for about a week and a half, with no pms symptoms. I did accidentally under dose myself, so I'm not sure if that's why, but my doctor said it was breakthrough bleeding. This is the only thing I didn't know that could happen and I'm struggling to understand why people who go into this completely blind, because I tend to worry A LOT.  Also, the fact that some people don't know that T is NOT birth control confuses the hell out of me."

For me, it is extremely difficult to push things out of my mind and forget about them, so I find what helps me more is to let it out.
