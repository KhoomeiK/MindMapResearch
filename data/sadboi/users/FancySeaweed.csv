I'm eating organic eggs, tofu, fish, yogurt, nuts, avocados, cheese, and the greens/veggies I eat often now are organic. I am eating healthy meals  (with maybe an addl snack during the day) --- which maybe is okay. I just need to find out if my metabolism will slow down. I am sometimes eating only about half the calories my macros suggest, not intentionally. It's really hard to get all those calories without processed carbs or whole grains. I think Dr. Fung addresses the metabolism issue, and I need to read it again.

BTW, your omelette sounds amazing! And that would likely sustain me, too, with maybe some nuts and cheese as a snack."

I need basic emailing, researching, and being able to read a lot of articles on a larger device. Need a more comfortable place to sit besides my desk chair/desktop.... to use device while on the couch or at coffee shop.  

I like to use the talk-to-text feature a lot even when writing emails. Would that be available on the iPad and the Chromebook, both? And I assume not on the laptop?

I'm more used to a touch screen but could adapt to a non-touch screen. 

I'd like to play some music and podcasts, though when home I can stream from my desktop to a Bluetooth speaker. I mostly use Spotify right now, would not be saving a ton of music to device. Most photos are in Google pics but I'd like to view and edit them from new device. Posting stuff on Etsy. Hearing a podcast. I assume I could watch a Netflix movie on either? Creating some documents, text. No gaming, ever. 

I also have an older iMac desktop that a friend didn't need anymore. I use it but am uncomfortable sitting at my desk. And for whatever reason my phone is a lot faster and I'm not dependent on (sometimes) spotty wifi for it. (It's a Google Pixel 1). I had a PC before and I'm still learning the iMac. I don't want Windows and dealing with viruses, etc. Want something I can use apps on. I would be using Wifi-only for the iPad also, but it would be much newer than iMac. 

I sometimes write and would like to store writings on device. And would like to store articles and be able to organize them.

The painting program on the iPad looks amazing. I would use that if I had it. I don't think it's expensive?

Would like to take with me when traveling although that's not often.

I don't know if there are additional costs  that come with an iPad. I know Apple tends to be expensive. There is AppleCare that is $69 for two years if I actually need that? and extra for a keyboard if I want that later. 

Are there things that the Chromebook can do that an iPad can't do? I assume a laptop is mostly needed if I need to download more involved programs? 

Thanks so much."

You can also use tempeh. If you're not eating other grains, there is plain soy tempeh. It's great protein and kind of a nutty flavor. You can put it in stirfrys, the same as tofu. 

2 hard boiled eggs with a cut up avocado (and salt and pepper or ""Everything but the Bagel"" spices) is a good breakfast or lunch. I eat lots of eggs, lots of avocados, and lots of nuts. I even put nuts in stirfrys. Fage 5% yogurt has a lot of protein and you can add a few blueberries and ground flaxseed.

But I do think Keto a challenging WOE if you're doing it vegetarian. The only way I personally can make it work is by *not* being vegetarian... by eating some salmon, some sardines, and some chicken sausages each week. It's just so hard (for me) to get enough protein otherwise...."
