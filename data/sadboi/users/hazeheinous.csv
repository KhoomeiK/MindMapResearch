depression,eodxw73,t3_brgu5r,1558483592.0,It ain’t stupid for sure. Started cleaning my room and showering were the first thing I tried to make them a daily goal when I was depressed. It actually felt good to have my room clean. Gotta start somewhere and honestly I’m sick living in a shithole.
depression,eodxgpl,t3_brh7gq,1558483295.0,"I feel better not because I feel I’m somehow a good person, but the more I talked to them, the easier I learned how to talk to myself the same way without prejudice."
depression,eodx4tt,t3_brfhvj,1558483076.0,I’m probably seeing one soon myself. But I don’t think I have a big problem. Is it still worth going if I’m feeling normal but just wanna know why I’m acting in certain way?
depression,eodw51z,t3_brffm6,1558482413.0,"Yea kinda..:/
Few months ago when I was at my lowest fantasize myself dying every second my school counselor was watching over me.
Now I’m normal but I guess just wanna vent as I’ve got 0 friends. I only got to meet the counselor for 20 mins. I didn’t have much to say that’s true tho. I’m glad my tutors at school are all super understanding and even more helpful and caring than the counselor."
depression,eocu3r8,t3_br4g9u,1558463957.0,"Birthday celebration is a nightmare for people who don’t have many friends, so I gave it up even when I have friends around me that day. And I don’t care much anyway. But last year during my depression I went crazy on it. Eating 2 whole cakes on my own in 3 days. It was painful and sad af."
depression,eo9q2au,t1_eo9pk1t,1558397504.0,"Oh great to hear you’re taking online classes. Don’t worry too much about those assignments you already missed, but focus to finish the things you’d feel better if you do it now. Summer class is a good start."
depression,eo9pr2a,t1_eo9ovru,1558397278.0,"Thanks! It was indeed very sweet of her. We went to Paris later as well, but only that memory really stick with my mind. I’m sure he’d enjoy the nature with you too. And there’s no better distraction than going somewhere nice, cause it’s physically healthy and visually pleasing. And all we could talk & think about were the books, where to visit & eat etc. lol you got the idea!"
depression,eo9nfjz,t3_br31q9,1558395628.0,"I’m an extreme introvert. I remember during my bad days my sister and I went for a day trip visiting museums, finding good restaurants etc. Then we spent the afternoon laying on the grass reading books, under the sun. It was really nice.

I guess just bring myself out of that depressing environment and go to a small town or nature (the best) feels better."
depression,eo9ma5p,t3_br2tjo,1558394805.0,"22 here was in your stage 2 months ago. Now I’m much better but still far from ‘good’. Mental illness is a bitch but you’re a warrior. I feel sorry that you and your brother both have the same issue. I think it’s very brave of you to write how you feel here, and certainly there’re millions of people struggling too. Talk to your brother if you can. Find a therapist if it’s affordable."
depression,eo9k4sn,t3_br2l8f,1558393309.0,"I think one of our major problem is that we are thinking too much about ourselves and the future, which no one knows. I’m a student and missing 90% of my classes this year. Spent all those time at home sleeping. we all know what we are doing isn’t helpful (well, it’s stressful) yet it’s hard to break the cycle. Just keep trying. Maybe start from cleaning your room or showering? Make it a tiny goal for each day. I’m still looking at reddit now but I’m writing my essay that’s due a month ago lol. Don’t give up."
depression,eo9blkw,t1_eo9b6mq,1558387317.0,"About self hatred. It’s killing me too. But I just tell myself that it is the thought loop that is toxic. Not me. Even tho I don’t believe this, I keep reminding myself this, that I have to find ways to get away from the thoughts. 
At my worst time, nothing works. But when you get better, try to go somewhere, read a book, have a haircut, do whatever that’s physically healthy for you like exercise. Just have to grab that tiny opportunity every time then things will get better."
depression,eo9b6mq,t3_br126o,1558387002.0,"I’m 22 studying at uni. First year. Never had a job. And I’ve been skipping most of my classes this year, so I’ve got no friends at school. Anyway, I major in art too. Can’t say much honestly. But I want to try doing better from today. So I’m cleaning my room first after leaving this comment. Drink some water. Then I’ll try to finish my essay that I’ve been avoiding for a month. Give yourself some time. Try to do something that could distract yourself from only thinking about depression. I know these are general stuff, but keep trying even tho they sounded bullshit. It’d work someday."
AskReddit,eo7ycob,t1_eo5p72v,1558351790.0,"Thank you for all the kindness! I read every single word. :) I’ve been missing my parents so much these days. I won’t be able to see my mom until July. But I just dropped her a message said I miss her, and the rest of it I’d probably write a letter. I think she deserves to know it. Wish you all well cuz you’re amazing. <3"
