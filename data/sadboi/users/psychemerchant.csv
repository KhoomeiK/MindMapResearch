I'm no authority on geology, but Carson's theories have not been peer reviewed or published in any sane journal in this age. For God's sake, he claims to be a ""geomythologist"". Just look at how he posits all these ridiculous theories with confidence, without one speck of evidence to prove any of it. All he has are speculations. Almost every respected scientist in the field dismisses him as a seriously misinformed speculator.

Joe Rogan experience is a really really really bad place to learn about critical issues. In fact, don't take any of these YouTubers seriously before doing a fact check. Read some peer reviewed scientific papers instead. Its easy to swallow what's published on social media."
