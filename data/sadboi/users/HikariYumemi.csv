They glossed over many key points, that okay maybe she didn't want to get into much details, but maybe if she wasn't comfortable Shane shouldn't have made a video about it.

For example, I still don't get how she could not have noticed that she was underweight when everyone, even the internet was commenting about it. Did she think everyone was wrong but her? Did she find being underweight very attractive?? What made her to think like that etc. I'd have helped if she could have brought insight into the gap between how she thinks she looks and how it actually is (she mentioned realizing that she lost weight when she was weighed and not before, but that's it).

I don't know maybe this is triggering to explain but I feel like it's a pretty empty video just announcing that she's better and not the informational video it could have been.
