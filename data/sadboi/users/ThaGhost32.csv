dating_advice,eyynrdv,t1_eyyn64t,1567596036.0,"The level of stupidity in some guys amazes. I‚Äôm no ladies man per se, but even I know that things like that are absolutely unacceptable. This is coming from someone who is known for saying some fucked up things too. You did the right thing and if he‚Äôs surprised, he should get an MRI to look for brain damage"
dating_advice,eyylje0,t3_czi0il,1567593459.0,"Unless you have clear as Day evidence, never make assumptions. As a guy, I know that this doesn‚Äôt go well with either side as I‚Äôve done similar things myself and completely ruined chances with some people."
dating_advice,eyyleao,t3_czi1y5,1567593275.0,"Find a time where you can talk to her alone and say something along the lines of: ‚Äúwe‚Äôve been spending a lot of time together and I wanted to tell you that I really like you after getting to know you better as a person‚Äù. If her reaction is positive, go for it and ask her to be yours"
dating_advice,eyyl82q,t3_cziac9,1567593047.0,"He might just be busy or he might even be trying to not come off as needy. I‚Äôd say wait a bit then if he still doesn‚Äôt and she still likes him a lot, she should text him to try and make plans. As a guy, I would love this because it‚Äôs not often that a girl takes the initiative and I think it‚Äôs very attractive. Just because he hasn‚Äôt texted doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt like her. The only sure way for her to know is if one steps up to ask the other on a date"
dating_advice,eyykvde,t3_czfgtk,1567592582.0,"Find out a little bit to see if there‚Äôs anything you like outside of their looks and if you genuinely wanna know more, ask them out"
dating_advice,eyykrtq,t3_czgy0w,1567592449.0,"That guy is so god damn stupid to make a joke like that to a girl. As a guy, I know that rape is a very sensitive topic for women so I choose not to bring it up. Good on you for blocking him. You deserve someone smarter"
dating_advice,eyudik2,t3_cypdrt,1567459279.0,"You don‚Äôt have to agree to everything they wanna do and you can always suggest something different. As a guy, I would be okay with that because the relationship should go both ways and I‚Äôd rather a girl suggest something she wants to do than hold it in and snap later on down the line. If he gets mad or upset, he‚Äôs probably not worth it because he thinks it‚Äôs all about him."
Tinder,eytexfw,t3_cyo1o5,1567434727.0,That was pretty good
Tinder,ewh49cq,t3_co5vkg,1565397480.0,What‚Äôre you doing with your big school words? Just use normal people words and I‚Äôll understand what you‚Äôre talking aboat
Tinder,ew6lsqz,t1_ew6lniz,1565175446.0,"A mix of both. I‚Äôd also say the ‚Äúgood weird‚Äù, like the funny and unique kind that isn‚Äôt creepy"
Tinder,ew6j7yc,t1_ew6j72l,1565172188.0,Na I have photos of my face for my tinder I just couldn‚Äôt upload another pic
dating_advice,ew3ovhj,t3_cmgd1l,1565089525.0,But you‚Äôll never know if she‚Äôs attracted to you if you don‚Äôt even look at her. You‚Äôre just guaranteeing that nothing will happen and hurting yourself. You‚Äôd be surprised at how many girls are actually very nice no matter how attractive they are and would be more than happy to talk to you as long as you approach them with positive body language
AskWomen,evjlupo,t3_cjrbaz,1564565064.0,"Guy here. That girls who enjoy sex are ‚Äúslutty‚Äù. I think that ridiculous because we all know that men enjoy sex, so why can‚Äôt women enjoy it too? Plus nothing turns a man on more than him knowing that he‚Äôs wanted and desired. I see no issue with a woman being open about her sexuality with people that she‚Äôs into because that‚Äôll let the guy know that he can be open as well"
depression,evjlf5c,t3_cjzusc,1564564818.0,"The one thing that always keeps me fighting when I feel like I‚Äôm gonna end it all is my dogs. I love them too god damn much and I can‚Äôt imagine how sad they‚Äôd be if they never saw me again... and if you have close friends, confide in them so they can be there for you. Your real friends will let you talk anytime you need to and would do literally anything to keep you up and running. I have bad luck with ladies too and that tends to get to me at times (I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend, am still a virgin, and never had my first kiss). But after learning that there were attractive women that were actually into me (only not making a move because I was cockblocked), I use that as a way to boost my self confidence because I know that pretty girls actually find me attractive. There‚Äôs always something to fight for, no matter how big or small it may seem to be"
AskMen,etuel5h,t3_cdg8eg,1563210815.0,Come onto him when he isn‚Äôt expecting it. Nothing makes a man feel better about himself than knowing that he turns his girl on by just being himself.
