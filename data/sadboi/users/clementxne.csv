AskWomen,fqgz0st,t3_gil16z,1589362090.0,"I worked in retail and whilst I in no way wanted to stay there long term, I didn't mind it at all. I rarely had to deal with grumpy customers, could just get on with the job and the people I met there were all wonderful - I made some friends for life and even after leaving I know the people there still have my back.

there was this new lady who joined as a manager on my department. I suffer with quite a few mental health issues and when she joined I was going down a pretty awful spiral. I thought it best I let her know sooner rather than later so she didn't see me being slow and out of it and think that was just what I was like. at first she seemed super super supportive - she thanked me for telling her, acknowledged that it was a hard thing to talk about with a stranger and offered her own experiences with mental health as a way of saying she related.

however it all quickly went downhill. she put forward extremely unreasonable times in which we had to get tasks finished and would lose it if we didn't meet it. she would do no work herself - disappearing off the shop floor to sort out 'manager stuff' like schedules etc. I know that managers do have to like. manage, but im  sorry, doing schedules does not take 6 hours and when you've told us to get a 9 pallet delivery done in 4 hours between 2 people, at least come and help attempt to make that a reality instead of sitting on your ass and complaining when it's not done.

when she was on the shop floor, she just stood around observing. would talk all the time then reprimand you for talking. take people away to do dumb tasks with her that didn't need to be done or ask them to do it alone. pair up with people on tasks that really could have been done alone when she could have helped elsewhere. would go around bitching about EVERYONE behind their back. I mean literally everyone. she would bitch about me, the section leader at the time, the section leader on the department closest to us, all the other workers on my department then, to our face, tell us we were great and she loved us and we were doing a fantastic job. as if no one would talk to each other and find out lmao

on multiple occasions she lied to throw people under the bus - my old section leader especially as he never settled for her bullshit and always called her out and stood up to her.

the worst things she did to me personally were use my mental illness against me and, beyond that first moment, show a complete and utter lack of sympathy and understanding. I had to take some time off and when I went in to give her my doctors note, she took it, read it, sighed, rolled her eyes and said 'I guess. make sure you get better.' lmao like I wish I just. could do that. and then, she would go and take MONTHS off at a time. and weirdly, she would always do this when she found herself in hot water ie. got caught in a lie, got found out for not doing a VERY important daily task that she said she did every day that is actually ILLEGAL for us not to do. that kind of thing.

this was the final straw for me, in showing a complete and utter lack of understanding and sympathy after my dog died. we had her since she was a baby, we raised her, she was a very very ingrained, important part of my home. she was always there, a rock and stability when I could find none. one day, she and our other dog escaped. she was hit by a car and killed. fortunately the other dog was fine, but I felt like my heart had been ripped from my chest. my whole world collapsed around me. i literally cannot describe the pain i  felt well enough. it's been a long time since this happened and I still can't look at pictures of her or I'll burst into tears. needless to say, it was a very very horrible experience and after that, my mental health took a sharp nosedive. I was NOT doing good.

I went in to work the day after the next and just. was not there at all. I was slow, miserable, kept crying, couldn't focus. a friend on the dept who I was working with took it upon himself to talk to my manager about sending me home (bless him ‚ù§) and after that, she pretty much. summoned me over ? she said i could go home after I'd finished what i was doing. then proceeded to chastise me for being slow, saying, and i quote, 'I know it's been a rough couple of days but you REALLY should have had that all done by now.'

I was so dead I just said yes, and left to finish my work. but looking back on it, it makes me so furious that she would respond in such a way to such a horrible experience. ugh. she was awful. I hated her guts and never should have trusted her. theres a shit ton of other stuff she did but I'll just leave it with - when she joined the dept as manager, it gained like. ¬£30,000 in losses. also she was caught stealing and fired looooooolll girl bye"

Please allow for more character customisation (Body type options! The super skinny lanky elf body type doesn't fit some characters, especially not my inquisitor. More hair options. More voice options.) 

Please don't make the bad guy be another mage in the group. You're trying to portray the mage/templar war as even ground with each side having their own point and some peoppe being for and against the group's respectively but you are also consistently portraying mages as being power hungry people who are very susceptible to evil and corruption and having everyone else suffer because of it. 

Also it would be nice to have information provided to us in the game and not as an extra in a book or something (see Empress Celene and Briala' s past relationship.) Even as a codex. It seems unfair to have such important info left out and put into a completely different medium. 

Idk I don't have much hope for it, I even doubt as to whether it will actually come out and if it does, if EA will even listen to what anyone wants. Just please for the love of god, don't try and push multiplayer and don't pump it full of microtransactions. edit: and give me a dog again!"
