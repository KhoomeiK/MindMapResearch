Only thing you need to consider is that the flavor of the dumpling dough (likely a neutral flavor that will be enhanced by the filling.) So the filling may seem almost too salty or seasoned on its own but will be perfect once encased. Kind of like tasting a dip by itself instead of with a chip or cracker. 

As for a thicker dough, yes, I think it would work great. Just need to consider seasoning and flavor of the thicker dough, I would think."

And, honestly, I usually hand knead my dough unless I'm really tired or don't feel like cleaning the counter (though I kneaded this in its own mixing bowl.)

It is also great for adding an airiness into hot chocolate over the stove and more fully blending the chocolate with the milk, especially if you're making hot chocolate from actual chocolate VS powder (which is far superior!) 

I also use my immersion blender to blend/puree when I make enchilada sauces or when I'm partially pureeing homemade salsas!

No therapist should!
mentalillness,erv3zcc,t3_c43ekh,1561305760.0,"I'm a therapist, and I can't think of a context where it's appropriate to say that to a client. Especially without time to discuss what that means or on a very first session. Our job is to be a container of emotions and be an ear to listen. Of, course, we do much more than that and maybe she was trying a more solution focused approach of trying to shift to the positive and strategies to get better...? But, I don't think that phrasing was a good choice on her part.

On behalf of therapists, I'm so sorry she caused you to feel that way. I don't think she's the right fit for you (or possibly anyone for that matter...) I've heard so many stories from my clients of not good things their past therapists have said... Unfortunately, there are some not so good therapists out there. But there are good ones too! I encourage you to do some searching of therapist profiles online and see if one profile resonates with you. I recommend someone who uses a Humanistic, client/person centered approach. Though I don't know what's popular in the Netherlands. 

Bottom line: I would never say that to a client. You deserve better. You can find better. Please don't give up finding the right fit. We are here to help you.

I see 15 to 20 clients a week spread across three days, and I teach two psychology classes at a community college per semester. I consider that I work a full-time job and a part-time job, and I think I'm spread not too thin but thin. How I take care of myself? I committed to a group class gym membership that I go to 3 days a week, I call my girlfriend when I've had a hard day, I talk with other therapists when I want support, I still go to my own therapy, and I love to cook.
