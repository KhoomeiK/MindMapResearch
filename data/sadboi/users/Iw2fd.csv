Consant bullying, being totally misfit, a strict school made me fall in to alcoholism as early as 14yo... I couldn't pass a school day without getting drunk, cause of everything stressing me. In 3rd year of middle school (middle school was back then 13yo-15yo here in Poland) I tried to change myself, went on a therapy for my anxiety, focused on studying, got a high place at a nation-wide contest which made me able to choose whatever school I wanted...  
And when I finally got to high school - it was already too late. I couldn't focus at learning at all, as I had no friends, struggled hardly to make even the simplest kind of relations. When that failed, I tried to at least focus myself on draughtsmanship and painting... But instead I have fallen into a downward spiral - got diagnosed bipolar, tried killing myself dozen times, once getting really close... Well at least it will get better when I am adult I thought...

depression,fpklkdm,t3_gd7jxd,1588696842.0,"Well man to make things straight :

\- Wanna be remembered after killing yourself? It depends what kind of person you were - were you a prospectous person with a life goal, or were you a quiet person living without showing yourself to the world. If you are the second one - even if you were still a teen, you wouldn't get remembered in such an impactful way you strive for. Were you  first one - people would care, as you had an impact on their life.

\- Don't worry - nobody but you family, closest friends (if you had such) will remember you month later, especially as a pathetic person, again unless you spent majority of your whole life as a pathetic person (I am such a person). But judging by the fact that you're saying you have someone you call friends - you are not such a pathetic person, you think you are .

Do you have a job? Do you attend college? Or do you take any kind of ""neetbux""? If so - you can still make your life at least bearable, if not enjoyable. Especially since your comment implies you have some kind of friends who care about you, so you aren't totally unsociable, another positive merit :)"

virgin,foft57t,t1_fod5e5c,1587742363.0,"Hi, I'm very happy to hear a legitimate response, it may seem like nothing, but it really means a lot to me . I had SPD diagnosed - it stands for semantic pragmatic disorder, kinda a mild case of autism which mostly impairs my social abilities, but it combined with a really hard case of adhd made me have literally NO friends for 16 years of my life - I was always ostracised as an odd one - and my house problems impacted this even more making me an antisocial mess. The bright side is that I have overcome a lot of Language related problems my disorder brought me, but the time I had to spend on working on it with therapies made me really aback compared to my peers, adding another kind of difficulty to my   
I will start with answering the last question - the only people I currently talk to are my colleagues, and we only talk about simple things like drugs, music and such - we aren't ""friends"" - the only link between us is our job. Also I sometimes whine to my older brother but he's got diagnosed Autism - he's really a closed person, who has serious difficulties with speaking his mind, but thank god, at least he can somewhat fend for himself - I mean he's graduated out of one of better Tech Unis here in Poland and now works in his industry. But he's the last person to whom you would go to with life-esque problems, especially social ones, as his life consists of going to work, and playing computer games, nothing else, and it always has been like that. He's the only person from my family whom I even can stand though. It's really ironic that both of us have cases of autism, and our household is a pathological mess XD.   
   On subject of my asexuality again I'm not 100% sure I am totally ACE, but a few occurences during my early teens period, and the whole familiar situtation made me not think about sex at all. Not like I ever had come further with a girl than exchanging a few lines on chat, or a friendly welcoming hug (well technically you could say I kissed... as a girlfriend of a peer used to welcome everyone she met by kissing them by the cheek XDDD) 

   As I said I don't have pure autism, and my adhd makes it even harder to focus, my work ethic is literal SHIT, and short term memory could be said to not exist - I forget everything someone says to me like a few seconds after hearing it... only to remember their words out of blue a few hours / days/ even years later. But I have to admit - on the few occassions I managed to legitimately focus (happened when I was taking adhd meds , but I can't take most of available ones anymore cause I have heart problems) on learning I remembered things quite easily, I also have somewhat ""photographic memory"" meaning I can give  fairly accurate Descriptions of things  I glimpse at, but this is also my bane, as it combined with my brain's hiperactivity make sleeping a really hard thing to do - I am constantly on sleeping meds since I'm like 12-13. 

Lastly touching the main subject of the thread - why does the concept of casual dating concern me when I have no plans of duing it? It's because like I said in the post - I find it hard to find any girl who wouldn't be focusing on it, having no kid and not being a ""higher standard one"".  I ain't looking for a wife for life - as I know having my male's creator personality I would only hurt her in long term. What I am looking for is someone with whom I could do things we both like, while not giving the other person too much of requirements, not restricting their freedom . 

Thanks if someone even read quarter of my rant, I just had to let it go.   
Also sorry if the alligning sucks - I don't really know how to do it properly.   
Again have a nice day, Pat"

Like really - for example (so speaking subjectively) I don't really have things I enjoy anymore, the only thing ever making me happy being reading comics, but to not have to work this freaking McSlavery to the end of my life, I'm learning programming. But how the hell am I suppossed to meet new people using this skill? Firstly programming, leaving aside using conversation to get advice on problems, is as interesting topic to talk about as for example defecation... Secondly there's no way for me to meet new people in IT in near future, as in my region there aren't any IT meet ups, nor do I know personally any person working in the IT.  
One of my mosty liked hobbies is kinda expensive (of course for me, a poor polish slave) and for most of my  implementation ... it was illegal.

(which I dropped out of because of mental health and wrongly choosen major) ... Since then I haven't ever been out with anybody, even though I tried inviting people on a beer, to no avail. My only socialising nowadays is at work and with my therapist. I work at McDonalds - while I'm the cashier I tend to elongate the conversations with customers. Colleagues treat me as a freak, I even got refered to as a f-word used to describe feminime or homo guys, people tend to laugh at my pedantic and excentric behaviour, but it's not a friendly laugh, it's the laugh people have at the circus, a cold and sarcastic one... The worst thing is that god knows how one person learned that I'm autistic and she uses this to make me uncomfortable every time I make a mistake saying things around the lines ""Oh see , Mr. Autistic, that's why we don't need you here"".
