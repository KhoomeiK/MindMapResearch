dating_advice,fpe5w2n,t3_gcwz08,1588540977.0,"Hi there, 26 year old male here. Got my first long term relationship at your age. Aftermath is bad, we broke up (and I still feel guilty about it without a logical reason) but it is just my luck... yet I digress.

So, how did a fat, round-face nerd started dating? Did it happen just out of pure luck? Or did I search for it? No, not either of them. Let's use bullet points to analyze my life back then:

- A double major student in one of the best universities of my country, had a rough year last year, but back on track, studying hard and acing every single class.

- Jump-started a club in uni (Biomedical engineering club, super niche, I know) and working as regulatory vice chair

- Did I mention I was fat? Yeah, I still am, but, I started working out, in a serious way. Had muscles showing up, but still a long way away from a whole wardrobe reset! (Yes I should keep working out, it's totally on me, please let me finish, okay? Okay.)

- Amateur story writing in a completely anonymous website (not here, a niche site that accepted e-mail addresses from our uni only) and making every single woman in that site expecting a new page every other day. Makes you feel like a celebrity.

So, the breaking point was me exchanging info with some people from that anonymous website. That one particular girl caught my attention. I couldn't stop myself from calling her thrice a day! (Yeah I can hear you cringing over there. I know, okay? I know.) 

We did a meet and greet, then arranged a night out, and the next thing I know, I'm in love with her. One thing I didn't know was that me and her weren't compatible in any matter except one single point. Yes, that point. (I'm literally ashamed to type it out. Wow, a guy, ashamed? Yeah I am ashamed.)

For me, everything spiraled down from that moment, yet it took me 6 years to understand it. Double major? Finished it in 8 years. Club? Abandoned it the first thing. Working out? Ditched it too. Stories? What stories? No more of them, ""all the girls read them"" and it makes her jealous.

Aftermath was bad, but, I had it coming. 

My two cents? Did you get your life together? Good. Go out there and get a proper hobby. If that hobby also gives you a guy who got his own life together, maybe make that guy your hubby. Did you not get your life together yet? Then get yourself together first and don't bother yourself with the relationship mumbo jumbo."

dating_advice,fnskd6m,t3_g3iu9y,1587223413.0,"Hi OP, I don't know about your country and past, but will give my 2 cents.

I'm a 26-year-old male living in capitol city of Turkey, Ankara, raised in a wholesome and understanding family, have double major in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and Biology, working as a patent engineer and got my first serious relationship at age 20. And I was desperate to get into a relationship. 

How desperate, you ask? Well, I bought her a ring, albeit silver and in a very, very odd design that I love a lot, in our THIRD WEEK (sorry I'm cringing over my stupidity). A female friend from engineering classes almost scolded me for it, and by God, she was correct.

We had a relationship, on and off, super unstable, for 6 years and some odd months, and I finally pressed the eject button. Now after 6 *insert your go-to profanity here* years, putting all the threats and blackmailing and profanities from her aside, I am back at ground zero. 

No, correction, ground basement, because I lost two crucial things because of rushing stuff. 

First thing is my ability to trust people. Including myself. I admit, I politely request to know every crucial thing in my family members' and close friends' lives. I want to know the headlights, not details, though. And the reason I pressed the eject button is based on my own girlfriend hiding an important financial decision. Now all I think about is what people are hiding from me.

Second thing is my ""purity"" in intimate matters. Yes, I know, there's no such thing as a male's virginity and ""all men want to stick it in anywhere it fits in my country"", thank you for all the clich√©, yet it is not nice to have a certain shape of human body stuck in your head whenever you think about sexual topics. 

Now, what I want to do if I ever want to get into a relationship is to go low and slow, but the right time for a new relationship is not now for me. It is time to reflect on my past relationship, focus on my psyche and body, start graduate school and be a wholesome human before searching for what I want out of a relationship.


TL,DR: Got first GF at age 20, had shitty relationship for 6 years, now I bailed and trying to fix my mind and body. Never. Rushing. Things. Again."

dating_advice,fl932yh,t3_fmwvf6,1584939440.0,"Three things actually. From less important to most critical:

3. Keep your finances in view. A new relationship most probably means a change in lifestyle, and even if you're earning a thousand dollars a day, your altered lifestyle may result in a little extra spending. Nobody can live without money in the current world, so it's best to look at your expenditures and channels of income early on. Well, who knows, maybe you will need to finance a home for you and her in some odd years later? It will help you to learn how to balance money early on, and help you keep your head cool.

2. Don't take things fast about anything, but keep it even slower about physical relationships. Life is not a long thing, yes, but it's easy to run out of things to do together. About physical relationships, it's necessary to have sex with your partner to make sure if that person is right for you, yet even sex can get mundane. So, take small bites of fun often, do something fun or relaxing or adventurous every day but don't squeeze every experience into smallest time frame possible.

1. Communicate clearly, in every little chance. Nobody can read the other person's mind. It's not possible to exactly know what that person is thinking or feeling every single time. Or maybe you didn't grasp the matter fully, and assuming something that's not even related (happened to me, guilty, yes). You will be safer if you ask what that other person meant and sometimes, it's good to say it like ""I'm thinking that you meant [your assumption or understanding of the topic], am I right or not?"" Please ask questions to understand, not ridicule or belittle other people. And please ask more until you are sure you understood. It will be easier to solve any problem with a clear communication."

Initially I was okay to feel tired and see her in the morning, since having a breakfast together is one of biggest time slots we can share, due to work hours and whatnot. But her attitude got to me yesterday morning, so I did not show up with a super short notice. It was sort of a a-hole response from my part, I admit it. 

We talked over it and she said she's sorry that she overreacted and I didn't ask her to promise not to do it. I know she will do something like this instance again in not-so-distant future. I asked her why she did so, but she couldn't give solid explanation yet. So, that's it so far."
internetparents,fhwsdzv,t3_f4v778,1581927913.0,"Hello, may I share my understanding as well?

I [26M, Turkey] have old parents [61F and 62M]. Age gap between me and my parents made our communication hard at my adolescence. I argued with both of my parents a lot. I had 2 bachelor's degree, and am currently working in a small office for medium pay. During HS and first years of uni, my mother was almost like your father. 

Then, I started tutoring high school students, and shared every story about that tutoring gigs. My mother's outlook changed drastically, she grasped that I'm getting a taste of real life, working for myself, struggling with my mental health issues and trying to balance work and school. Even though her comments kept hurting a lot at first, I kept sharing my experience with my parents. In time, their look shifted. I began sensing the respect in their attitude. It came after a good 5 years, but it eventually happened.

Now I think how it'd make me feel if I never felt a change in their attitude. I admit that I'd be sad, disappointed and discouraged. Yet, I'm a young adult now. Okay, I may make mistakes, but it shouldn't stop me from trying to do good things for myself. It applies to everyone, I guess. Every adult, however young or old, should try to do good things for themselves.

I'm not in a position to give advice at all, but here's my two cents: Please keep working, keep getting mental health support, keep practicing for your driving licence and try to do every good thing for your health, happiness and life quality. I believe in you. Good work. And Godspeed."

Yet, there are two students in that class, whom are about to fail that class almost surely. They said to each other ""Dude, forget passing this class. Let's go drinking."" They leave class after that, also not entering the final. They planned to retake the class next semester, or next year.

Prof agrees to give a multiple choice test. Yet, prof states that every wrong answer will decrease overall points by a fraction of a question.

It hurts to admit that I've given up on an incredibly huge career option for her.
