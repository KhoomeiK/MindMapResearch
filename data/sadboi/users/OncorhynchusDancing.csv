My man leaves laundry on the floors - the living room, bedroom, bathroom. I stopped picking it up a few years ago. When he noticed, he whined. I responded: *I am your wife, not your fucking maid. I wash (at the time) laundry for four people, and am tired of picking up after YOU a grown assed man.*

I left it at that. He still leaves shit everywhere, and I still refuse to pick it up. Unless I EXPLICITLY SAY: **I AM DOING LAUNDRY PICK UP YOUR SHIT SO I CAN WASH IT**.. it stays there. I am about to stop saying even that.

What I DO wash, IS inside out, or it's two shirts in one. His crusty assed socks are bunched up - and it stays that fucking way.

A few times, I washed his work uniforms - wash, dry, hang up. He complained I didn't do it right. So I said: *Fine, you do it.* and I walked away. Now he fumbles, trying to remember to wash them, and keep up with the washer/dryer cycle - because for twelve years or so, I have managed that. ""Why didn;t you tell me it was done?"" 

BECAUSE I SHOULDN'T BETHE ONLY GROWN ASSED PERSON LISTENING TO THE RYHTHM OF THIS APARTMENT. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

breakingmom,fmbyaby,t1_fmbqoi6,1585935438.0,"It's hard. I buy more or less the SAME shit EVERY weekend for meals - breakfasts, lunches, dinners and **SNACKS**.

I buy the usuals: generics where possible, fresh fruit and veg, store brand breads - cheapies. My job is to keep the food bill in check.  I know what's in that kitchen, pantry and storage. I keep a little extra on hand of dry goods (bulk oats, lentils, rice) in case I forget shit when I am at the grocery.

I know what I can get away with as far as feeding this household and still satisfy my husband's ""I MUST have meat or I will DIE"" fits, make sure my kids are fed and do it cheaply, while with imagination.

EVERY TIME I MAKE A LIST he says, ""IDK.. you just do that.. I don't have a say in what you cook.."" Which is.. incorrect.

EVERY WEEK, I LOOK AT RECIPES. I SEND THEM TO HIM AND ASK HIS THOUGHTS. hE only says: I don't like food without MEAT. And I dont like BEANS. I try to do a new recipe once a month - something off Budget Bytes - her stuff is cheap, and tasty, and usually flexible AF.

&#x200B;

I sent him **one** time after we moved here, to do the shopping. He spent triple the amount in food, somehow, and brought home nothing but hotdogs, steaks, chips, dips and carrots. WHen I freaked out he said: **Well gee, you're so good at making dinner out of nothing, I didn;t think this would be an issue. I got what I liked.**

I legit screamed at him. We had an honest to fuck fight - He simpl,y couldn't fucking understand why I was pissed. He felt, truly, that he was left out of meal planning and that HIS tastes and needs should come before the household's needs.

He doesn't grocery shop anymore, and is VIGOROUSLY and aggressively included in list making and grocery trips. He has a much bigger grasp of what I am constantly trying to do here at home as far as the budget.. I may not make money, but I DO try to ensure we adhere to the budget."

AskReddit,floqx8k,t3_fpyb6k,1585343665.0,"I worked at a deli here in WA. My uncle ""knew the owner!"" and ""Pulled some strings!"" - as much as I was grateful, I was not happy, and felt obligated to accept the job. He did this before with a coffee house, and while it worked out, the experience left me feeling waspish at him - he was very.. ""LOOK! what I DID! for my niece!"" (on FB) He crows a lot, and it is a major turn off.

But you know, I needed to work, so I took it in the end. We had one car at the time, so I was forced to rely on my husband for rides on his days off to take me in, and drop me off while he watched the kid.

&#x200B;

It was standard kitchen work. Making mediocre sammiches, soups, salads and pies. Lots of stuff came from instant mixes and cans, while being advertised as home-made. IDK. My breaks were timed FEROCIOUSLY, everything I did was scrutinized - first by the owner who declared all I did as unfit, and then by my co-workers, who said constantly: You have to do better, or she'll fire you.

I was frantically trying to do better, be faster, cleaner - I mean, I learned lots about being clean at Starbucks. This place was not clean though - no amount of scrubbing or bleach really would changed that but ok. I learned a good amount of stuff tho; like how to pull a pie out of your ass, how to tell a good shipment of lettuce from the bad, how much salt can make day old soup better or worse and so on.

My car situation changed; and suddenly I needed rides to work from a co-worker. Boss only said ""Make it work......"" via text. Her daughter (22) would walk into the kitchen, pick foods from the cases with her bare fingers (meats, cheeses) and eat, sip soup from the ladle and put it back in the pot - no gloves, hair free flowing (we had to be gloved and hair had to be pulled back and covered) - but my child, then 3, upon seeing me working ran back before she could be stopped and got screamed at. She only took two steps in. I was told ""Kids are FILTHY! You need to control her!"" (and to be fair, she's right, kids are gross. Though I was working, my husband should have kept an eye on her. BUT DONT YELL AT MY KID)

Started getting there early with this person, but I wasn;t allowed to work - ""You can;t clock in because it's not time for you, it'll be a liablity.. and she hates paying overtime..."" While she DID clock in early, and started setting up the kitchen. Weird, but alright.

So; I'd read a book. What the hell else do I do, right? At my appointed time (not a minute early or later!!) I'd clock in and start working. This went on for a month - I hated it, but understood what I thought was insurance related shit. 

Suddenly, that co-worker couldnt drive me, so I scrambled. I asked my uncle for help, he sourly agreed, bitching/crowing the entire time. My husband's work made the real dollars, so this was was me trying to keep busy, earn extra monies and try to enjoy a job with food.

Instead, I was frantic with stress. I couldnt make this woman happy. She started telling me that my Driver Co-worker ""really busted her ass to help you...... and you can;t even wash a dish?"" and other shit. (It is seriously not hard to wash a dish, fyi)

&#x200B;

It came to a head when I was home on a day off. Husband was also off, it was a rare thing. My phone rings. It's my boss. I answer, but instead of her, it's my co-worker and my boss, talking about my performance. I didn;t do enough. Why do I sit there and fucking READ when I COULD be helping out in the morning? How fucking rude. She thinks she can raise kids with that attitude? She doesn;t control her kid AT ALL.

It was pretty crappy. I ended up hanging up, only getting called back and asked why I hung up. When I tried to answer, I was told to come to the deli tomorrow morning, we need to talk about my poor performance.

I went that same day, took all my aprons (washed and dried!) to tell her I was quitting. My husband went in with me, he had a feeling I guess. She went OFF. I was telling lies, apparently. She never called, and if she had I didn;t HAVE to sit there and listen!

She tried attacking my husband verbally (She had a very 'im in charge, i'll get my way' attitude) and brushed her off and told me to gather my stuff, lets go. SO she turned to me.

""You're going to let your pussy man boss YOU around?""

gosh. He seriously grabbed my hand, flipped her off and took me home. She beat on my window and said, ""WELL, are you working tomorrow?"" I didn't answer her.

My uncle called me 30 minutes later, pissed off. I ruined his relationship with this 'local business figurehead in \[city\]' and I shouldn;t ask him for help. My cousin, his son, messaged me saying his dad and the deli owner were trying to clean up the mess I'd left by leaving 'without notice'

I never went back. I didn't get my w2 until the VERY last minute. Same with my final paycheck.

I didn't talk to my uncle again for five years. Really haven;t worked a steady job since; focusing mainly on being a SAHP to my now two kiddos.

One thing I know: I DID do my best - I cleaned, I cooked, I washed every fucking dish. I learned where and when I could. My mental health absolutely tanked there, and after I left, I felt shakey, but better.

I lasted 7 months. Sometimes, as bad as you need the fuckin money, the job is not worth the stress, strain and anguish."

My body seemed shut down, my breathing went nuts, my heart rate went nuts. I was stuck in the car, on a freeway, in the rain.  I started sobbing, rocking back and forth and huddling. It turned into incoherent, hysterical screaming. My chest ached - was I having a fucking heart attack? I freaked out more. I felt half way floating out of my body, disconnected. (this did not help) Was I dying? I wasn't ready. 

We got to our destination (a pumpkin patch) and I was left alone, in the car. I expected to calm down, but I did not. I thought it was just anxiety.

Nothing helped. Eventually it DID fade, I DID calm down. Reality did seem to come back.

GODS it is EXHAUSTING at times, but it helps ME stay on task/time, and subsequently them. And if I DO find myself rushing and getting shitty, I DO have to think - did I get up too late and fuck up The Routine? if I did, I need to get tf up when my alarm goes off.   


Did The Routine change for a reason tho? an early before school dr appointment? I gotta warn them the night before to be ready for the change, and to be more flexible in the AM. Because they DO notice changes, and one is confirmed to be ADHD (like me lmao) and the sudden change in stuff sets us off BAD.

OP has it fuckin right. Plan ahead if possible <3"

TalesFromRetail,fh2o0mj,t3_f15par,1581258590.0,"Was working at Starbucks. (Onerous fucking job, no lie.) One of my regulars (came in every weekday, 7am. Ordered an iced chai and an oatmeal with fruit/nuts, no sugar, and a banana.) - she was very polite, friendly.

Came in without fail - she worked hard.

One day, she came in later than normal - I asked if she was playing hooky, right? she laughed it off.

Four hours later, Im doing my end of shift lobby sweep - and there she is. She's staring at the floor while she eats a banana - automatic little bites. She's by the window.

""(Name) - hey girl? hey are you ok? I thought you'd be at work or something.""  
She looked up after a moment, and says, with this blank expression, ""I- I lost my man.""  
""Wh- (Name). Do you mean he left?""  
""No, he- he had a heart attack. I don't know what to do. I didn't know where else to go.""

&#x200B;

oh fuck - right? I ended up pinging my manager, telling him I had an emergency. He took over my sweep and clocked me out while I walked her outside. We sat in my scary assed van while she just talked.  She talked about everything. Her husband, his daughters, her relationship with those daughters, husbands health, the suddenness of his passing. She talked. I listened. 

We sat there for two hours before she finally left - a daughter had called, asking her to come back so they can help with arrangements.

Gosh, I cried. I went home, called my dad and cried even more.  She didn't come back for a week. When she did, she seemed distant for a very long time - which is understandable. They were together 15 years.

&#x200B;

I think about her now and then. I hope she is doing ok.
