It just seems you're being highly padentic about the situation, you said he's swell because he took a picture with a group of girls and, I'll make it clear so you don't throw a fit, he's a swell guy because he dated a girl that apparently only dates swell guys. It's as if you're trying to be this god that pin points everything a person says and when he makes such a little assumption or maybe something so small the average person would overlook it you just rip into them like you're some wise guru.

It's true anyone who responds could be a fan, but when someone comments a post entirely positive with reasons that are just poor you wouldn't be crazy to assume they're a fan.

Amber Heard is an awful human being who tried to frame Johnny Depp as an abusive man, and filmed a video of him where he drunk himself deep as a result of finding out about his mother's death and he wasn't able to spend time with her beforehand.

So let's analyze the deaths, there are 253,000 deaths globally and America has had 71,065 deaths. 71,065/253,000 = 28%.

And bare in mind those are reported deaths, there is nothing fake about that and it's the official statistics reported so if anything it's bound to be an underestimate of what they are. These deaths were reported after those who had been tested due to the coronavirus had came back positive, all these deaths were people who had the coronavirus.
