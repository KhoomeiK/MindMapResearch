depression,fnocb13,t3_g2zezg,1587120211.0,"Detergent is a painful way to die, and ofc I don't think you should kys, that would horribly effect those around u that care about u, however much u feel your harming them now, can not compare to if u weren't here. I value u as a human being, that's why I don't think u should kys, also your young and if u truly think your a bad person or whatever (highly unlikely), you can change, especially at this age. You could try to notice things u do that u dislike and in that moment regonize it, then maybe next time hopefully you'll notice before u do it and stop yourself"

I urge u, if your friends are down, to open up about stuff, it makes things easier"
depression,fnni6m7,t3_g2t9fo,1587092940.0,"Just because areas are being like diluted by non-white people, doesn't mean they or the powers that be that allow it to happen dislike or hate white, that's really faulty logic. Dilution is just a byproduct of a variety of people wanting to be in America or Canada or whatever. Any argument from the position of cultural differences, sure , that's understandable, but the other stuff is such bs

From all this analysis of the decrease in the amount of white people, makes me infer u have some yikes opinions about other people, why is less white people inherently bad."

Drugs,f50jjgc,t1_f4zgkb0,1571928404.0,"I'm hoping it being such a small dose will lead to a shorter time to recover, but I glad that know regardless of how long it will end

I've always been very philosophically geared but never got around to reading much as it relates to the subject. Also I haven't been very spiritual in the past, perhaps even reductionist, but maybe this event calls for it.

I'm not sure what the mundane cause would be but I surely hope so, a list of my main problems would include:
Loneliness,
Not great relationship with parents,
Bad self discipline leading to poor school performance,
Not very confident.

This did help thank you"
