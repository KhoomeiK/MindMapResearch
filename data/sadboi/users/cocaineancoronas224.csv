When I lived with my parents I tried to talk to them about it but as amazing as the parents I was blessed to be born with are they simply couldn't understand.  My mom would try to listen to me but then I'd find out a week later from my brother that she had told him she felt like I wasn't really depressed or something like that.  That sound so small when I type it out but hearing that always made my emotions feel made or meaningless.  I grew up with every advantage and opportunity, grew up going to gifted schools and being heavily involved in the arts.  But here I am almost 20 working construction with no college experience spending every penny I work for on drugs and alcohol.  Despite apparently not believing when I lived with my parents my mother tried to get me to therapy severely times but after hearing how she truly felt from my brother I would tell her I wasn't depressed and I was fine because I felt like nothing but a burden.  Now I live with two roommates that can't stand me because I'm a mess and work 10-12 hour days of hard labor 5 days a week so I now have literally no time for therapy.  Sometimes I wish I could talk to someone and they could at least diagnose me with depression or something so I'd at least know what was wrong with me.  Stay strong friend, nobody knows how you feel inside all that matters is what you know about yourself.  I've never been diagnosed so I feel like I don't deserve to talk about how I feel but all I know is that there's something wrong with me there has to be some sort of reason I feel like this every day.  I'm probably in a pretty similar situation as you so I guess I'm not a great person to take advice from but it's 3am where I'm at and I'm coked up and drunk again I feel like I need to say all this right now.  I don't know much about life but from what I've experienced I feel like all we can do is hold onto the few genuinely happy experiences life gives us and grind through the bad until we get to the next happy moment in life.  I wish I had my shit together so I was able to help people going through shit but I don't even know how to jelly myself.  I know life feels meaningless and sometimes you probably feel like everyone hates you or your life is meaningless, but anybody can change.  I'm so fucked up right now I hope my comment isn't seen as annoying and I regret it when I wake up and I'm sober but idk who else to talk to and you all seem to feel exactly as I do, I don't even know you but I want you to know if you ended your life I would care, I would cry for you because you're a fellow human on this fucked up earth and you like everyone else deserves to feel normal/happy.  Stay strong friend, you're not alone.  Even if you're miserable now as long as your life continues there's hope of change/happiness, but if your life ends all hope is gone it is never worth it.  Think about where you were a year ago and how much has changed in your life in only a year, now imagine how different your like could be in 5 or ten years.  I love all of you this subreddit gets me through my nights he safe everyone ❤️"
