mentalillness,fr0neks,t3_glulna,1589801526.0,"I’ve had my bipolar 1 diagnosis for almost 20 years. I can’t even begin to estimate how many times I have felt like this, more than could be imaginable or believable. You’re in a dark place right now, so what I’m going to tell you will be difficult to believe but I PROMISE you, it’s not like this forever. I can’t predict how long this will last for you but what I can tell you is that at some point it will go away, and you will feel okay again. It’s not likely you’ll suddenly be cured, but you WILL have moments where you come back, and you’ll be so very grateful you didn’t give in to the darkness. Your brain chemistry will change, and change again. I know this is an almost impossible thought to comprehend because of how you’re currently feeling, but you HAVE to hang in there, you have to fight those demons in your mind. You must know that at some point this will turn. I’ve been there, I’ve been hospitalised, I’ve had failed attempts, and I’ve been devastated on so many days for just waking up, why? Why couldn’t I just have gone in my sleep? It’s so painful. I’ve had 20 years of this shit and trust me when you have good moments, however brief, there’s a clarity that makes you so very grateful you held on. You CAN do it. Go to war with your thoughts, challenge them, accept that your brain isn’t working correctly at the moment and that’s not your fault. Live for those moments that WILL come in the future, those moments of reprieve. You’re not alone and you’ve done the right thing reaching out. People here will support you. Keep fighting. One day you’ll know it was worth it. And the advice that everyone always rolls their eyes at me for giving out is: EXERCISE, even if it’s for 5 minutes, even if it’s just for two. I’m on more meds than I can count and my psychiatrist told me exercise works better than any drugs she can give me and she wasn’t wrong (and yes I thought that advice was bullshit, but it’s a lifesaver for me). Baby steps. Just DO NOT quit, you’ve come this far, keep going."

bipolar,fou8wb0,t3_g5cat1,1588079102.0,PS sorry for writing 5 billion words there. I didn’t realise it was that long until I pressed send.
bipolar,fou8svu,t3_g5cat1,1588079040.0,"I went of my meds once and it was a total disaster that I barely remember except that I ended up not talking to any of my family for 3 years. I wasn’t off long, just long enough to make a mess of my life and I went right back on them. I’m on Pristiq now (antidepressant) which initially I praised because it worked well. Then one night I forgot to take it and all hell broke loose. I woke up shaking, the bed was soaked with sweat, I felt like I was going to vomit (a lot), my head was spinning like I was high on some terrible drug and I couldn’t get it to stop, I could barely get up to get towels to wrap myself in. I had no idea a legal drug could have such intense, terrible withdrawals - 6 years later and I’ve NEVER missed a dose again. Sometimes if it’s a few hours later than normal the ‘feeling’ starts and I take it immediately but know I’ll feel shit for about four hours, but rather that than not taking it at all and going through that again. 

I don’t expect ECT to cure me, my psychiatrist has told me that I will be on meds for the rest of my life no matter what. All I want right now is a break. I’m rapid cycling like Lance Armstrong. Yesterday I was hypomanic most of the day with a few very minor low moments, then around 9pm, in a split second, with not trigger, no reason at all, I was horribly depressed and saw no viable future for myself. I was hollow. Moments before I was fine, I was positive even, then everything changed so fast, faster than I could comprehend. I took a couple of Xanax and drank some beer so I’d fall asleep and not feel anything, I couldn’t bare it anymore. 


Today I woke up feeling okayish. By 3pm I found myself at paying for $300 worth of stuff I didn’t need at Kmart. I messaged my best friend about something unrelated and totally normal I thought. She called me five minutes later and said ‘you’re manic’. “No I’m not!” I declared. She asked what I had done today, I told her I ‘just went to Kmart’ and she said ‘See! You ALWAYS do that when you’re manic!”

Now it’s 11pm and I’ve completely emptied a storage room, washed everything, and am still going strong. I’ve been at it since just before 7pm with no break until writing this now. 

THAT... that is what I want the ECT to stop. My moods have never been so unstable. I can’t say they’ve really ever been predictable, but right now I’m very aware that all it takes is one second and everything in me changes and I don’t know how long I’ll be up, or down or what’s around the corner. I’m constantly on edge. One minute I’m functioning at my peak and the next I can’t even think properly because my brain just shuts down, I can’t read or watch tv, or make something to eat. I just stare into space until the switch flicks again."

bipolar,foel9n4,t1_fo4eirv,1587706810.0,"I found when I finally felt euphoric it was addictive and I didn’t want it to stop. I ignored the bad stuff (I labelled those as ‘fun things’ I deserved). For once I had a mania I haven’t had before, I wasn’t raging, I wasn’t aggressive, I didn’t have any psychosis (I think, usually I know afterwards but as I’m sitting thinking about it, I can’t recall having any delusions or hallucinations - okay maybe I felt special, a little bit, maybe I thought one or two minor things that might not have been true, but nothing hectic). I just felt so capable, of anything, I had a confidence I’ve never had before and it was great, I wish I could always be confident. But then it went away, really fast and I was worthless and miserable and hated the world (within hours sometimes). 

The truth of it is I’m so sick and tired of the solution being ‘add this drug’ or ‘increase the dosage of this med’ - how many more times can I actually do that? I’m desperately waiting for isolation to end so I can get in for ECT which my psychiatrist has highly recommended. Right now, I’m all for that. Willing to try anything to stop swinging so much and so fast."
bipolar,foekofn,t1_fo38ye9,1587706337.0,"It’s just shitty because I’ve almost always had semi-unpleasant episodes of mania, irritation, aggravation, can’t sleep, can’t stay still, everything annoys me, I want to do everything but it’s too overwhelming so I do something that annoys me when I’m done because it was a waste of time, I could have done something fun like art, but ended up cleaning like a crazy person. Then the good kind came, and I felt really happy and I liked it. I felt like after all these years I deserved this, but of course I ignored the negative things mania brought, or somehow convinced myself those bad things were actually good. I’ve had my medication tweaked now so I’ll wait and see what happens."
bipolar,foekdj5,t1_fo2hlrz,1587706091.0,"Yeah, I know it’s meant to even me out from both perspectives and sometimes I’m terrified I’ll get too low and sometimes I’m terrified I’ll lose the highs. I’ve got a pretty good, albeit large, amount of meds that are mostly effective but every now and again something changes and my meds need tweaked again, which my psychiatrist has just done, so I’ll see how it goes."
bipolar,foek6r6,t1_fo2kju5,1587705939.0,"Thanks for this. I needed a reminder that I can actually do things without being hypomanic or manic. I have a schedule, pomodoro I installed on my watch, practice mindfulness, meditation and yoga and when I’m okay I exercise every day. I’ve had this a long time and try to do everything I can to fight it but sometimes I forget that it’s a fight, and sometimes I’ll win and sometimes I’ll lose and that’s okay. I do actually have ADHD too, which I’m also medicated for, along with C-PTSD but for some reason the label of bipolar is the one I always ruminate on. I really don’t think you sounded even a tiny bit condescending, you were a voice of reason for a person that forgot all these things and needed the reminder, so thank you."

Like if you are talking to a coworker about something completely unrelated and you just blurt it out, it could be uncomfortable because they are taken off guard and may not consider the relationship the kind where you share personal information like that. Don’t think of yourself as being rude, just understand that people don’t know what to say, so backing off is their safe, ‘go-to’ reaction. That’s not about you."

I didn’t know any better, even after I discovered that wasn’t normal, I thought I was just ‘special’. Eventually the penny dropped. The other kids didn’t think I was crazy... nope... they thought I was a satanist and so I kept to myself after."
bipolar,flw2m3g,t1_flvkgrt,1585538051.0,"It’s really hard to say, I don’t remember too much about that time except for the grand finale event that made me realise that my medication was essential, just like my psychiatrist kept telling me. I started to listen to uneducated family members opinions about me not needing medication, telling me the psychiatrist was just using me as a guinea pig, that I’m only on meds so others can profit etc. I DID know better but that kind of talk certainly did me no favours. I listened, went off meds, blew up my life and like I said slowly mended broken bridges over a few years. 
It’s only now, that they know better, unfortunately it took a police escort to the emergency room (recently), & getting sectioned for them to realise that my illness is serious. Somehow seeing the physical wounds made them see the emotional ones too. I couldn’t hide it this time. I think the fact that police were involved too probably scared them. 
My mental health is quite volatile. I don’t know why, I was sort of stable for a while. This means I have to see my psychiatrist every 1-2 weeks, get my blood checked more often than was previously necessary and my psychiatrist sometimes does random phone calls between visits to see how I am. We’re keeping a VERY close eye on my meds, and we tweak them regularly. I was meant to be going for ECT soon & a month in the psych ward, but not sure that’ll be happening with the corona virus issue. In instances where I can’t be hospitalised my psychiatrist basically keeps me heavily sedated until the mood shifts. Like most of my life it’s a bit of a ‘wait and see’ thing."

I needed more paint & supplies, so I had to go to the shops to get everything. No problem, I was motivated and excited for my next project. I went to the shops and got my paint. On impulse I bought a whole bunch of jewellery making supplies too (I don’t actually make jewellery but anyway!). So, I got home, opened up all the packets of tiny bits and pieces, put them in little jars, labeled them all (technically this was absolutely pointless as they were already packaged and labeled, I could have just put them in a drawer). I sorted out my paint supplies, got my canvas ready and then... it was dark. I was tired. I was no longer motivated. So I gave up that idea all together and just got annoyed with myself instead. No problem I thought, I’ll do it tomorrow... which is now, today, 4:30pm Sunday (32 hours after I got the idea to paint). I took my supplies outside, put them on the table and that was the end of that. So now, I’m not even getting to to the point of starting things and then not finishing them, I’m just planning to start things and never actually getting that far. Urgh. Frustration."

Some days you are going to be stuck in the closet, and it’s going to be the only way you can cope, and right now, with everything that’s going on - that is okay. You don’t need to spend additional energy trying to fix your symptoms and reactions, sometime you just have to go through them because it’s all you can do. 
For the headaches, my neurologist told me to take 2x paracetamol and 1x ibuprofen and then alternate 2x ibuprofen and 1x paracetamol in 3-4 hours. Obviously I don’t know what medication you are on, whether you can take those (always check), but they are both over the counter medications, actually not even over the counter, they’re on the supermarket shelves. Also make sure to stay hydrated during this time and don’t skip your usual caffeine intake as it can cause headaches.

I have loads of plants, mostly outdoor ones. When my best friend calls me and suspects I might be a little manic or depressed she will always figure out my mental state before I do. She has two questions she always asks lol. “How many plants did you buy?” - that tells her I’m down and miserable. “How much stationery did you buy?” that tells her I’m hypomanic. It’s funny because I generally always answer with “Yes, BUT this time...” and she’s like “Nope. Think about it!” and damn it she’s right. With plants though, I think I like them because I get to care for them without added stress or pressure. It’s not a human so it can’t talk back or upset me, and I don’t have to keep it alive. I just watch them grow and it gives me a lot of alone time when I really need it. Going to have a bumper crop of tomatoes soon because I planted loads of seeds and WAY more than I expected germinated. I also grow some herbs and pineapples.

I also find that when I’m looking forward to doing THE THING, I’ll procrastinate even though I know it’ll be enjoyable, almost like I’m self-sabotaging in a way. So instead of getting into that painting I’m dying to do, I’ll suddenly NEED to reorganise my sock drawer first. 🙄"

ADHD,fkmt03q,t3_fjat2h,1584338917.0,"20yrs ago I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1, OCD and a few years later PTSD and ADD. My family has had 20yrs to come to terms with my conditions. I left home within a year of my first diagnosis. 
Over the years they’ve told me the drugs are doing this to me and I don’t need them, that you can’t trust psychiatrists because ‘they keep filling your head with this nonsense’. Some other ‘helpful’ things they’ve said:
- If you just get a regular sleep pattern you’ll be fine
- If you went off your medication you’d be so much better
- It’s all in your head
- You CANNOT tell ANYONE about these conditions ever. You’ll just destroy your life. 
- Why are you so erratic?
- Why can’t you just do the things you are supposed to do, you just have to try harder. 
- You are too smart to have these problems. 
I could continue for a long time but you get the point. I was placed in a psychiatric hospital at the time of my initial diagnosis so that should have been enough of a clue but anyway. 

Fast forward to the recent past, I’ll try to keep this short. I went to a public park in the early hours of the morning, decided I was done, police came, I was sectioned. This time I couldn’t hide the wound or the trip to the ER. This time, they found out because a friend (who know knows my issues) didn’t know where I was, frantically investigated, found out and immediately called my family as she was out of town. So it took 20yrs, being taken away and guarded by the police in the hospital and a massive, confronting wound, for them to realise these things are real, they realised I could have died and now they are finally paying attention. (I do not know who called the police on me, as I assumed nobody would be around at that time, but someone saw, someone called and here I am) 

I know how frustrating it is. I’m sorry you’ve got to deal with this."

bipolar,fk65cal,t1_fk4j615,1583894023.0,"This is honestly such a great place to come and learn things, because we don’t get given any sort of in-depth manual. We get given the basics, a small list of typical symptoms and then a handful of meds. We get told hypomania and mania are sort of like bouncing off the walls with happiness, but dig deep and you’ll find that some people, like myself, have quite angry, irritable and unpleasant episodes of what’s meant to be ‘the good bit’. They didn’t tell me about rapid cycling or mixed episodes back then either. It was just the little standard text book list of symptoms. It can become overwhelming and confusing when you don’t know what’s happening. THIS is where you’ll get support. 

I got diagnosed 20yrs ago and I’m still learning things to this day (we didn’t have resources like this subreddit back then and I come from a family who seem to believe that if you ignore something it goes away. They also forbid me from telling ANYONE, even my uncle and his daughter, my cousin, who is about 15yrs older than me and also has bipolar 1, I’ve only started to open up in the last 4 years or so). 

I’m glad you are here. Never stop learning or sharing. This is by far my favourite resource for this illness. This is the ONLY place I’ve ever felt understood, and sometimes when I can’t think straight someone gives me an answer (that in a normal state would be obvious to me) and I suddenly remember “oh yeah, that’s what I’m meant to do when I’m like this”. I’m so very grateful for being part of this subreddit and I am so glad you’ve decided to join in. Everyone here has been amazing so far. ❤️"

bipolar,fk392iq,t1_fk1sqh6,1583822405.0,"She sounded like a real keeper, unfortunate that didn’t work out. 

Everyone says it’s a totally different experience for men and women on Tinder. I haven’t actually got any bad stories. Sometimes there was just no chemistry but we had dinner and a chat and what not and went our separate ways. Other times things worked out (on a temporary basis because I don’t want to actually date for a long time). Some of the guys I’ve met were really cool and we stayed friends. 
The concept is kinda dangerous though, I get that. A woman goes to meet a man, a complete stranger, he could be a really bad dude, there’s no way of knowing. That’s never happened to me (but I always tell a friend where I am and share my GPS location and set a ‘check-in’ time for a phone call or text so they know I’m okay). 
Must be more difficult for men because there are so many women out there that are complete fruit loops and I hear a few bad stories from the guys I’ve met. So I do think it’s better for a woman than a man. Just my take, based on my own experience so far."

Psychosis,fk0njmj,t1_fjpbyzg,1583761784.0,"I get this too. My first memory of this happening was when I was in high school. A boy in my grade died, we didn’t have any classes together but I knew him and sometimes we’d walk home together as he lived a few houses away from me. About a week later, during the change of classes he walked past me in the hallway and I was shocked and confused and truly didn’t understand how it was possible. I had a dream that he died and it was so real I didn’t even think twice, he had died, yet there he was alive & well. It was really unnerving. I’ve had it quite a few times since (high school was ages ago) but I still can’t tell if it’s real until everyone else can prove to me that it didn’t actually happen. Sometimes the clues like in the details that when I think about them rationally, I realise they don’t make sense or are impossible (like the time I went to the beach with a friend and a barge had pulled up on the beach for the cars to load on to go to the island. For that to happen the cars would have had to have driven up a narrow beach, on the sand, I clearly remembered it being low tide, which meant the barge would not have been able to pull up to the shore without getting beached, and there’s absolutely no way cars could possibly get to that section of the beach. Also that friend informed me we had never been to that beach together ever, it’s nowhere near where we live. I remembered us getting ice cream and everything. I remember the corner cafe. None of it was real). Scary but it happens."

bipolar,fjf2k08,t1_fjc51k1,1583282938.0,"I’m not proud of this, and I realise that my actions did me no favours. No negative vibes please. 

My first hospitalisation was when I was either 19 or 20. I hated it from the moment my bed was assigned to me. I hated my assigned psychiatrist. After the first group meeting, I saw him and said “I shouldn’t be in here, I’m not like these people”. (pls note I was young, getting diagnosed, scared and in denial). He looked me straight in the eye and said ‘YOU. Are exactly like these people”. I ended up in their most intensive therapy course which has only 10 spots out of about 200+ patients. I didn’t think I was that unwell (denial again) and that he only put me in there to prove a point and to punish me. On top of all the other therapies I had to see this guy once to twice a week. In the first week I protested, argued, told him I was fine and needed to be released. He said “I will be the judge of that NOT you.”
By the end of the week I realised my words, actions and behaviours were the reason he was keeping me in. I wanted out so badly. I realised I had to play the game. I had to tell him everything he wanted to hear (true or not). So I started off Day 1 of my plan saying “I’ve been thinking, and you are right, I’m in a bad way and I am like everyone else here. Acceptance if the only way I can heal and I’m ready to accept all the help you give me and follow all your rules. I’m sorry I didn’t see it before.” (Our words time that effect). I stroked his ego in the most subtle ways. I figured out what the ‘right’ answers to his questions were and I gave him those. I faked it the entire time. 
Within a week he was astounded by my progress and said he was ready to consider releasing me. I told him I owe it all to him, blah blah blah, more ego stroking. 
I got out. 

Years later the cops dragged me to the hospital, I got sectioned. It’s usually a minimum of 72 hours and I faked me way out of that too. I told them I wasn’t suicidal and the wound was a big mistake, I didn’t mean to cut so deep etc. I was under police guard for HOURS and maintained a calm and relaxed vibe the entire time. It takes a lot of effort to pretend so hard, but it’s better than the consequence of getting locked up against my will again. I was nice to every person I came across despite wishing I had died. Yes of course the cut was an attempt, but I said it was self harm gone wrong. Long story short, they all believed me and released me in less than 18hrs. 

Like I said. I’m not proud of this. It’s just something I’ve learned how to do over the years. For anyone reading this PLEASE DON’T DO THIS. Be honest because although I keep getting out, that’s just a short term benefit and the long term risk is definitely not worth it. All I did is run from treatment I needed only for it to come back with a vengeance making everything worse."

bipolar,fj88b88,t1_fj82kzk,1583107384.0,"Thank you for replying, it’s funny (not haha funny) that you’ve just told me everything I know I’m supposed to do, except I ‘forgot’ - I don’t know if that makes sense. Its like I can’t access that part of my brain, memory & logic are disengaged. I’m not sure why I posted in here instead of calling my doc - that’s what I’m meant to do, yet the thought never seems to enter my mind at times like this. You said ‘you don’t have to be alone’ - that got me because people keep telling me that, they keep telling me to stop ‘pulling away’ from them. Everything you’ve said is like an echo. I remembered I even have spare ‘right-now’ meds that I also seem to have forgotten about until you brought it up. Shit... I don’t know why I seem to have to wait for someone to tell me what to do instead of being able to figure it out for myself. Every. Single. Time. 
I hear you on the feel-good hypomania, it’s so incredibly rare that I feel happy or full of life or experience stereotypical bipolar. I almost envy people with that kind of hypomania/mania. I’m just on the go non stop, I get irritable and aggravated, I don’t like to be interrupted, I must complete my mission, and then I find myself in some sort of fucked up situation that ends with a trip to the hospital, against my will. 
Thank you again for taking the time to reply, I really appreciate it and thank you for guiding me. My best friend usually does this bit but she’s overseas. My family isn’t quite as adept at recognising my symptoms etc. I haven’t lived with them since I was initially diagnosed (about 20yrs ago), so it’s all a bit ‘new’ for them (we were estranged for a while). Unfortunately by the time they figure it out (or act upon it maybe?) I already know, so it’s a bit late. My dog used to predict this 2-3 days before I’d know but he’s not with me anymore. This morning they asked why I’m awake so early again, then commented on the great job I did cleaning and tidying the terrace & garden (until 4am, they don’t know that bit lol). 
Thanks again :)"
bipolar,fj7yt6e,t1_fj6t6va,1583101286.0,"That’s a great question. The only thing I can do is wait for my psychiatrist appointment this week, I’ve only recently come out the hospital so I’m going regularly. I like that you asked what the routine is, part of the problem is I just don’t have one anymore, my entire life as I knew it is gone. I’ve just gotten divorced and lost everything in the process and I mean everything. My previous support structure is gone. I have to live with family until I’m well enough to get back to some version of a life. Thankfully, I have a good family and someone is always nearby to keep me out of trouble, well, as best they can anyway, it’s not foolproof or I wouldn’t have ended up in the hospital recently. It’s all a blurry mess. So for now I just ‘wait and see’."

bipolar,fi6p721,t3_f6rqu3,1582203592.0,"This is so accurate. Despite the fact I was diagnosed almost 20 years ago my family still don’t understand what having bipolar (1) actually means or what I endure. That’s my own flesh and blood, so I have little hope anyone else could ever understand. This forum is a godsend, it’s the first time I’ve ever felt like I’m not alone. 
Also... what a DICK! Perhaps a change of career is in order because he’s never going to survive with those beliefs. Nobody gets to tell you about your illness or how legitimate it is. Very, very few people know I have bipolar 1 mostly because I can’t be bothered with the stigma or ignorance. I generally stay far away from those I know when I’m depressed or manic. After confiding in a close friend once, she turned around and said ‘Oh that’s nothing, we are all bipolar at some point’. That instantly ended that friendship. Come back and tell me that again when you can’t tell if what’s happening is real or not, or when you hallucinate or become delusional or get hospitalised against your will or try to kill yourself, or do some stupid dangerous shit when you’re manic. People are assholes. Don’t let them get to you."
bipolar,fi6j8e8,t3_f6kmi8,1582197426.0,"Yes, I’ve assumed that since I was 13. I’m almost 40 and shocked I made it this far. Sometimes it feels like that’s what I’m waiting for, that moment that seems inevitable. Although I’ve had enough and have been over it for a very long time, I’m still here. Had a close call a few weeks back, police came, I was sectioned and I thought afterwards I’d slip back into my life with nobody finding out but I was SO wrong. All the closest people to me found out as my best friend knew I’d been taken away by the cops but didn’t hear anything after that, and a frantic search to find me ensued. It was also kind of hard to hide the bandages etc. Almost all of them cried, some hysterically to the point they couldn’t breath properly. They told me they felt they’d failed me, how much guilt they had, they begged me to promise not to do it. So now I’ve got that fucking guilt on me. I really didn’t expect the devastation they went through and how supportive everyone suddenly became. Down side, I can’t go anywhere without being questioned like a teenager. If I don’t answer my phone they freak out in case I’ve gone through with it. So now I feel I can’t because of the pain I caused them, I saw it and the guilt is so incredibly unbearable, I can’t forgive myself for putting them through that (and I didn’t even die). I see every single face in agony when I close my eyes and think about it. I wasn’t ready for that. 
Now I just presume one day I’ll move far away, slowly lose contact with everyone and just go when my time comes."
bipolar,fi6i0mv,t3_f62ixd,1582195827.0,"Had a psychiatrist appointment at 12 this afternoon. She called me yesterday morning when I was still asleep and in my ‘meds hangover stage’ - which basically means I’m exceptionally dumb and don’t always remember what I say. Anyway when I woke up again yesterday, I changed it in my calendar. She said 10am today instead of 12. I get there at 10am today.  I had to get up super early to take the bus because I cut my hand really badly (by accident), severed an artery and had some nerve damage and long story short my hand doesn’t work properly right now so I can’t drive. 

Anyway, I arrive at 10 and she’s in the reception area. She gives me a super strange look, comes up to me and says ‘Don’t you remember I called you yesterday?’ to which I confidently replied ‘Yes that’s why I’m here, you said 10am’. She goes ‘uhm, I said Monday’. So sheepishly I say ‘oops I guess I’ll see you at 10 on Monday then’. She goes ‘wait a minute’ and checks the computer and says ‘It’s not even at 10. We changed it to 12pm on Monday’. Wow. I wasn’t even close. So my almost 2 hour trip in was for nothing. She tells me to wait a minute, because by then it was 10:03. She disappeared and came back and said ‘You won’t believe this but we called my 10am appointment and she forgot she had an appointment today so I can actually see you now!’ 
So now I don’t have to spend 4 hours back and forward on Monday and today’s trip worked out perfectly. Note to self: stop answering the phone when I’m asleep 😂"

Looking back, I do have a lot to be thankful for and to be proud of. I was diagnosed at about 18yrs ago. I was okay for a while, I got my degree, got a great job, got married and moved overseas. It was exciting but that is also when I really began to struggle again, no friends, no family etc. I managed to hold up my career for a good few years, but with increasing difficulty. 

I was eligible for disability about 10yrs ago, but refused to accept it and pushed on as far as I could. Now, here I am, completely unable to work. I haven’t worked in a couple of years.    

I was hospitalised again recently (emergency). Finally after this last hospitalisation, a family member took me to apply for disability and told me it’s nothing to be ashamed of, I’m unwell and it’s not my fault and I don’t have to feel guilty. I still struggled to accept it though. 

I’m really so grateful to you for your response it’s exactly what I needed to hear and coming from someone who knows this illness, makes it all the more meaningful to me. It’s almost like I had to hear it from someone else, someone outside my circle for it to finally be ‘okay’. I hate that mental health has such a terrible stigma and I often get mad at that, but if I can’t accept it myself, then how can I possibly expect others to? You are so right, just because I am disabled by this condition doesn’t mean I can’t live rewarding life, as I do have so many positive aspects like my family & friends & this community. I’m not alone despite what I sometimes think. Once again, thank you SO much for taking the time to reply to my comment, I’m so glad you did, I truly appreciate it. ♥️"
