makinghiphop,fm2ydeu,t3_fsjs3v,1585708338.0,"We find it hard to let go of certain attachments sometimes, be it a loved one after a break up or the sense of feeling good which makes things complicated because we don‚Äôt like feeling down so we automatically strive for 24/7 pleasure, that however isn‚Äôt possible as one cannot be reached without experiencing the other they go hand in hand, they are like both end of a seesaw of an emotion. But if we only go for pleasure we start to crave it meaning we end up on the opposite side, if someones way of coping is a destructive habit like smoking or pronography, they end up needing more & more to reach the same effect. What we must do is this, go towards discomfort, go face our fears be brutally honest with ourselves, listen out for our higher self & constantly move forward. 

Don‚Äôt feel frustrated if things don‚Äôt go as planned or if your feeling shit just own it & look at it like how can i grow from this.
Clear the head, go do something you like that isn‚Äôt a destructive habit, meditation is phenomenal, I feel like relaxing & working go hand in hand with eachother just like the sea saw, you absolutely need to rewind and relax in order to become better, work with more spirit, unlock new creative powers.

Let‚Äôs remember that all we have is this exact moment, no past, no future.
Let‚Äôs let go of our worries by remembering that we‚Äôre all in this together, it‚Äôs all going down right now at the same time everywhere & there‚Äôs always someone in a worse situation than us so why not just be grateful for our life‚Äôs, no matter what we have going on there‚Äôs always more things to be grateful for than to be worried about.
So with that being said, if instead of dwelling on our own existence we go out there into the world with a helping hand & a willingness to give ourselves to others, I know for a fact the world would be a happier place inside & out. 

Now imagine seeing humanity work together like this while tripping on shrooms from the space station!

It can be hard I know, but you can‚Äôt give up you MUST keep moving. 
Take it step by step, try different things with the aim of healing yourself.
Meditate, exercise, write, sing, help others 
Whatever it is that makes you feel better start with that.
I really recommend you add meditation to your daily practice, look up ‚Äúmiracle morning routine‚Äù by Hal Elrod & study the shit out of it, go for a run  & just try to focus on the moment, listen to Alan Watts lectures, Stoicism, look up the art of effortlessness or ‚Äúwu wei‚Äù some ancient stuff that actually worked for ages!
If your looking for a quick fix then I want you to know that it doesn‚Äôt exist, any pills they try to throw at us saying they will cure our problems will most definitely bring about more problems than they will cure, everything takes time.
The closest thing to that is probably dmt.
If you can afford it, right now, book a flight to peru & get an ayahuasca shamanic ritual done which is also dmt.
Micro dosing has also been proven to have outstanding effects on depression & other mental health issues.

Again most importantly 
Do not give up!
