\- licensed under a CreativeCommons NoDerivatives license or a similar license, which allows sharing while banning any code editing. I have not yet seen any mobile app licensed under a license like this.

>Not all developers implement OBB files downloading

Yes, that's true. Not sure what point you're trying to make here.

>Many apps put files in the ""Android"" folder which users find very useful to handle via other apps, such as chatting apps (Slack and Telegram), web browser apps (Brave) and emulation apps (share the ROMs).

That's a good point.

Ultimately, it's up to the developers where they're going to save these things. And it's up to their audience to convince them to use the right places.

There are designated for downloads, pictures, videos, etc. on Android. These apps should really be using those, it seems.

That said, I can see a good argument being made for backup apps accessing these folders, in that case.

>If apps would want to be nice to users of the above, it would still not be good: users would be forced to use their UI/UX which might be bad or restricted, or they would just put the files in the main storage volume, making it all exposed which means you lost all privacy/security claims for this restriction.

As mentioned, the appropriate place for e.g. downloads from Brave would really be the Downloads folder.

Users give app permission on a folder-by-folder basis, and these permissions can be temporary. That's inherently more secure than giving broad access to the whole file system.

>Apps that have access to ""Android"" folder already most probably have access to the rest, which has much more ""juicy"" files (your photos, videos, documents...).

See the paragraph I wrote above.

>Many apps are free and available, and it should be perfectly fine to be able to install them freely. Check ApkPure website for example. Those are not pirated apps.

Actually, it seems like they are. Unless all the apps there are being published with the copyright owner's permissions, which doesn't seem like they are.

>Overview in the Android settings for file storage is not enough. In many cases it's even showing you wrong numbers. Try to put files in the SD-card path of apps and see that it doesn't show information about it at all, for example.

Okay. Something to work on. Not really relevant to the Android folder argument – the numbers should be reflected there.

>Or try to look at the tiny system app that don't make sense that they are so tiny.

Those system apps are often just skeleton apps, with much of the code being part of, well, the system.

Again, though, not really relevant to the Android folder argument.

>Again, this is a public folder which takes space of the user on the main storage volume, and is accessible via USB. Why should I be able to reach a folder via USB, but not via the device itself?

I agree with you there.

>As for backup, the private data files of apps are protected and not the topic here (for those you always needed root). But for the rest, you didn't, ever. Those files are public and should stay public. They are important for full restoration of the installation (excluding again the data). This shouldn't require root, just as getting the APK files don't require root. Restoring apps from storage was always faster than using the Internet.

The compromise one-time payment did get through the senate, along with the abhorrent trillion dollar bailout.

In any case, the discussion here is about whether Nancy Pelosi is a good leader or not. She was the one AGAINST a universal payment for all Americans.

Also, Bernie isn't the definition of progressiveness. Every action he does isn't intrinsically progressive and it doesn't make sense to say ""if Bernie did this, then that's the progressive thing to do"". Instead, we have the definition of progressivism. Citing Wikipedia: ""Progressivism is a political philosophy in support of social reform. It is based on the idea of progress in which advancements in science, technology, economic development and social organization are vital to **the improvement of the human condition**.""

Note the improvement of the human condition part.

This bailout was absolutely terrible for most Americans, only increasing the disparity between them and the top 1%. Pelosi made sure it passed and without any accountability, as she refused to hold a recorded vote. By definition, not at all progressive."

The $1200 was **a Republican proposal**!

In fact, after the idea of a universal payment was floated by both Republicans and progressives (with initial proposals calling for **monthly payments**), Nancy Pelosi was against it – see [https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/18/refusal-pelosi-consider-universal-cash-payments-response-coronavirus-pandemic](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/18/refusal-pelosi-consider-universal-cash-payments-response-coronavirus-pandemic).

progressive,fpbbem9,t1_fpba96c,1588466201.0,">So hurt people for some political points?

No. The opposite. Prevent hurting people, despite it potentially costing some political points (because of how Republicans would twist it).

People were hurt by the bailout. The bailout gave big companies millions, enabling them to buy out any smaller companies that go under, enabling them to practice financial negligence without reprecussions, enabling them to lay off workers because they don't need them right now and can make it through the pandemic without lifting a finger thanks to the bailout money. Meanwhile, unemployment rates are skyrocketing, people can't afford healthcare, and are struggling to make ends meet.

The meager one time payment of a few hundred dollars was a ploy to get people onboard. If Democrats refused to go along with it, Republicans could say that they're not willing to give them the few hundred dollars. In actuality, they would be doing the right thing, fighting for the people.

AOC fought against the bailout, for the people. It'd be good to have another progressive voice in the House doing the same."
