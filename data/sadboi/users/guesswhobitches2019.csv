ADHD,f2chhse,t1_f26lcau,1570138231.0,"The last neuropsych I went to literally didn’t believe ADD was a real thing so he was biased from the start and he gave me literal IQ TESTS like bro wtf does intelligence have to do with ADD? Implying we’re all a bunch of dumbasses or something? Was I “too smart” to have ADD? Jesus 😳 Also re: focusing under pressure it’s like they don’t realize hyperfocus and selective focus are a thing 😏 I’ve always “thrived” under pressure due to my procrastinating/avoidant nature... And the tests were easy ASF for the most part therefore not that difficult to focus on? ?? So apparently if I’m not a dumbass I can’t have ADD, nice. He had such a strange variety of tests he gave me for one who right off the bat says he “doesn’t believe in ADD” 😳"
ADHD,f2cgz9r,t1_f26lcau,1570138023.0,"Ughhhhhh that’s so frustrating!!! 

See, I’ve gotten tested by a neuropsychologist 3 times in my life since I’ve been displaying heavy ADD symptoms since at least like, 2ND GRADE and all 3x they said I don’t have it bc I am able to focus under pressure when someone’s watching me do a timed test?! But then my psychiatrist diagnosed me with it a couple years back based on a self-report questionnaire to which I answered yes to like all the symptoms but then that diagnosis “mysteriously dropped” from my official mental health records 👀 She prescribed me Strattera which quite frankly didn’t do shyt for me but I think I could do really well on a stimulant like Adderall."

You see, I hesitate to take too much direction from those who label themselves “crippling alcoholics” but I know y’all don’t judge me. I used to call myself an alcoholic and was sober for 4 years, but I think that is mainly bc my parents are both sober with decades of sobriety in AA so I knew how I ~could~ end up and was definitely overindulging back then. I was also like 18/19 😂 So idk how atypical that is for that age 🤷‍♀️"
