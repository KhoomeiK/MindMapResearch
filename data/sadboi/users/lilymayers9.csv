SelfHarmScars,fr0mrj1,t3_g9xrky,1589800957.0,"if you haven't tried already, try some silicon gel or silicon gel sheets. They look like keloid scars which is something I have (genetic thing). I am clumsy by nature and also have burn scars and prevented them from becoming raised bumps like what it looks for you. Google keloid scars if these scars haven't improved over time. I hope this helps."
SkincareAddiction,fr0j6gn,t3_gkuvmo,1589797562.0,"I have keloids scars and the only way to treat them is to have cortisone injections! (steroids). Yes silicon gel helps to get them calm but they won't 'flatten'. You can also buy steroid tape from JAPAN - it can work over 36+ months. 

Keloids tend to pop back up if you do have surgical cuts because it classifies as a trauma of  the skin.  depending on your genes. It might work for you, but my dermatologist have always advised against it because of the possibility of them getting worst. 

Does this scar inch and tingle? because it might be a hypertonic scar - similar to keloids. 

It doesn't look like a typical keloid scar to be honest so you might be right in getting it surgically removed. 

Go see your local dermatologist or skin specialist because if it really bothers you then it's worth it."

Herpes,fpf2bh2,t3_gcsea5,1588560143.0,"um, perhaps be creative and see if you can cum in other ways as well as thinner condoms. just be honest and see if you two can work something out together.

Even if you are still in contact with him and haven't had further intercourse, this little secret will nag you always. The worst thing is obviously rejection, but the best thing to come out of this is: 1. that you can be honest and 2. he may okay with this skin condition. 

But at the end of the day, you do what feels right for you. Hope this helps."

One day, I was awake/alive after a morning swim. Never felt better! and then midday, and that 'condition' creeps over me. Next thing I know, I'm blind drunk and crying. Desperate for love.

The thing I took away was to make sure I feel safe and comfortable and do something that only you like doing first. For me its swimming. Then when you feel strong enough, you can start exploring other things that makes you feel good.

You probably exhaust yourself socially?? 

I hope you find something that sparks your interest in a healthy way and slowly you will feel like yourself again. You know you when you do. much love"

BPD,fo8mvsh,t3_g61gi0,1587599691.0,"Thanks for sharing that ! It made me laugh because imagine your stomach and the toilet ... ops.

I also struggle to express my intense emotions. one day i was in a mood of love and just wanted to be affectionate. people around me don't take to it as well as i hope because it's JUST TOO MUCH. The urge was so real and i mostly drink and smoke heavily to numb it. i couldn't EXPRESS it. I decided to take a hot bath to soothe myself, forcing myself to sit in that hot bathtub and boy did I understand the feeling. I felt so suffocated by the hot water. but any excessive urge for expression was released. i know what it must feel like on the receiving end. 

but thank you for sharing great tips when we are struggling to cope. it made me chuckle heartedly."
Herpes,fo6b5li,t1_fo5500p,1587553302.0,"Whichever the scene is will be fine; the concrete jungle or wilderness, won't matter too much really. 
also the dating apps is totally relatable even for us girls. i agree that it's better to judge a character in person than through a swipe. but the ghosting happens - wouldn't take it personally. 
perhaps don't overthink, you sound like you are quite selective or meticulous - bound to overthink (i do anyway). Even with the HSV2, just let go, stop looking hard and be yourself. she'll come strutting into your life like you won't believe. good luck."

Herpes,fnyqt1d,t3_g4oh01,1587372171.0,"it sounds like the symptoms of it, but you need to head to the doc's and get the small bumps swabbed, and blood test drawn to get a proper diagnosis. I took a herbal steam to relieve the fevers and headed to the pharmacy to get the x3 anti-virals for cold sores because at the time I suspected it right away.

what works for me is if you just walk away or let us cool down. so that no energy can be fed into the bpd. it takes heaps of work on his part tbh, he has to understand himself first and then he can direct u on how it can be better. usually a safe word helps in a fight. like ""i need to take a *pineapple express* right now!""

Herpes,fnkj94j,t3_g2b3y0,1587029148.0,"I can't be certain, and although herpes may be a stigma, it sounds like it's an underlying thing. You said you feel unworthy of love. because you have a common disease which is totally non-life threatening.  This maybe be an attachment theory and how you perceive what love is for you and your sense of worth in relationships. 

Honestly, it sounds like your bf/gf is solid and totally fine."

BPD,fncltb4,t3_g0np5r,1586840074.0,"Hello. first of, it's really brave of you to share this and it sounds like you have been as honest with yourself as a way to get better at this. 

I completely understand what you are feeling. Ever since I was a young, I had the most intense crushes for boys, and still experience it to this day.  my example would be: I had a short encounter with a guy at a festival and when I came home, I couldn't sleep a wink! because I was fantasising about a possible happy ending. This lasted for at least a week wondering about this random stranger...  I understand as having 'child-like fantasies of a romantic partner 'rescuing' you.  (The sub: **BPD and the Inner Child dwells deeper into this.)** It is our way of holding onto the idea of love and comfort in our minds. It's supposed to make us feel better but of course this just leads you down a pit of despair and confusion. I know it must be exhausting ! 

What I have found helpful is first just write down all your thoughts about him (whether it is your daydreams, fantasy or hopes). This is to help clear your mind and solidify it on paper. 

You can read it back to yourself, keeping in mind that perhaps the reason you are still hung up on this person is your way of finding comfort and your needs for connection and love. Those breadcrumbs you mention is exactly that. 

Now if you reflect against what you wrote about with him, ask yourself what you really need for connection and love. What does that realistically look and feel for you? What do YOU want in a healthy happy relationship. And does he really fit that bill for YOU? For example: This feels good/or okay for me when: someone genuinely asks me how my day was. I need someone to respect me as my authentic self, or that person gives me a warm hug. WRITE these down to remind yourself. 

Remember that in reality, this is actually about you. It's probably nothing to do with him as he has been upfront with you. 

Now is a good time for you to focus on you! It can be difficult but if you find something that makes you feel good one day it really makes the difference. For example: pat something warm and cuddly (a pet); I personally go swimming (I can't atm); you can do some mindful colouring; anything that you just love doing! 

I'm sending a warm hug to you and to say that you are a precious human being like everyone else that wants love and connection. Stay strong and give yourself the permission to just comfort and love you. and spend time with your loved ones if you have any! xxxxx"
