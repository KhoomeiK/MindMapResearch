SuicideWatch,fpydwrr,t1_fpwkrjx,1589002169.0,"""It took me a while to learn that not all therapists are equal""...yeah, I can attest to that.

One psychologist I went to on recommendation was retiring at the end of the month at the time I went to see him. He approached my problems with the drive and motivation of an employee putting in their two weeks notice. I won't repeat what he said, but his advice was about as helpful as you'd imagine.

At the same time, that dingbat recommended/forwarded me to someone who ended up being my favorite counselor in the world. She, unlike the dingbat I saw before her, helped me let go of burdens that were bottled up for years. Like Anemone-ing said, and to add a little to their point: Psychologists are people too. Sometimes you'll get lucky, finding the right one off the bat, and sometimes you gotta search a little and find the right one for you. I know that sounds like a tall order, but it's really not as difficult as I'm making it sound."

The only complaint I have so far is that the dialogue needs a second glance from a proof reader here and there. That, and maybe I haven't seen enough of them play, but Samus, Wii Fit, and Palutena only seem to have generic dialogue for each other. Kind of a let down if you're a smash fan like I am.

Other than that, I'm enjoying the game! As for a suggestion: I'd love to see some .hack//G.U. representation. Seeing Atoli, Pi, Alkaid, or hell even some of the guys would be great. Really feel like that series doesn't get a lot of love."
