Knoxville,flqzyxu,t3_fq8mzn,1585410046.0,"Yes I agree! I have had to go to the grocery store a few times to get supplies. When I go, I wear gloves and use hand sanitizer,  I don't get close to people and I certainly DO NOT BRING MY KIDS OR HUSBAND WITH ME. However, I have seen whole families in the stores, like it was a family outing or something!! I don't get it!"
xxfitness,flm9amp,t1_fllyqtc,1585277646.0,"Yep, probably fasted and have done tons of prep!"
xxfitness,flm96x0,t1_fllpn5v,1585277575.0,"The only time my stomach looks flat, never mind visible abs, is when I am eating low, low carb."

depression,fkl06xr,t3_fixd8i,1584295659.0,I am so happy that you made the right choice!! This is such an important message: do NOT do anything like this on an impulse (or ever)
PlanetFitnessMembers,fkkm1ig,t1_fkja24g,1584287066.0,"It is very common to look at your phone between sets! I do that all the time. Sometimes I am looking at my clock, watching How-To videos, getting on Reddit, checking my email, etc. BTW, I am a woman in my 50s. I am sure my form is not always perfect and I don't lift as heavy as some others, but I have never felt like I was being judged or anything! Or maybe I just don't care! Anyway, I say go for it!"
PlanetFitnessMembers,fkklr3b,t3_fio326,1584286882.0,I went yesterday. There was hardly anyone there.

PlanetFitnessMembers,fkb4aaj,t1_fkb3si9,1584025824.0,Does your spray have any odor? Ours is also purple but has no odor. I use Fabuloso at home sometimes and it has a pretty strong odor.
PlanetFitnessMembers,fkb41ms,t3_fhaf8f,1584025686.0,Well it sounds like differing potions are being used. Ours is also purple and watered down but literally has no odor to it so I do wonder if it is even doing anything!

ADHD,fcd3wrm,t1_fc95xo0,1577606041.0,"I can so relate to this!! Sometimes I want to go around and say to people ""but I am actually pretty smart,  I swear!"" And sometimes I know I sound like a know-it-all. Or try to be. It's just because I am so insecure about people really thinking I am dumb. I am just so in lala land and inside my head so much, sometimes it takes me a while to integrate what I am hearing, or to put together an intelligent response (which I have in my head, I just am not able to articulate it!)"
Marriage,fbn434c,t3_edx0zr,1576992461.0,"He does sound like he might be a little passive-aggressive.  Maybe he is afraid of letting you down by not driving you around, but also resents you for it? (I am not saying this is right). I would sit down with him and tell him that he doesn't necessarily have to offer to drive you if he really doesn't want to. This particular issue mught be resolved soon when you do get a car, but his passive-aggressive behavior will likely come up again with another issue in your marriage if you don't resolve it."
Marriage,fbn2w0p,t1_fbn05qt,1576992011.0,Very good book!
Marriage,fbn1knj,t3_edruhz,1576991516.0,You need to get out of the marriage now. It's only been 14 months. Cut your losses.

fasting,f8kjex1,t3_e0x6aa,1574611725.0,You look great - beautiful AND strong! Can I ask: do you lift during your fasting or your eating window? Also how many grams of protein do you get a day?
Marriage,f8il3c7,t3_e0w12n,1574590080.0,I think it is wise of you not to jump into anything so quickly! You all are SO young! Have you thought about talking to a counselor to explore why you are having so much anxiety?
Marriage,f8iicvz,t3_e0ponx,1574589191.0,Very good advice!
