AZCardinals,fqgi7cv,t3_gisius,1589346934.0,">Winner: Kyler Murray, QB, Arizona Cardinals

>I mentioned three other 2019 quarterbacks earlier, but I'll add a fourth to the list with the first overall pick from last year's draft. It isn't complicated, of course: Murray was given the gift of DeAndre Hopkins, who will add to a receiving corps that already featured Christian Kirk and Larry Fitzgerald. The Arizona offense was also better after adding Kenyan Drake last season, and Drake was retained on a transition tag. Kliff Kingsbury's offense will not lack for weapons.

>I'm still a little worried about the offensive line, but the Cardinals did re-sign left tackle D.J. Humphries after his best season and added Josh Jones to compete with Marcus Gilbert on the right side. Last year's MVP was a second-year quarterback who took a leap forward after his team spent the offseason surrounding him with the right weapons. It's asking a lot of Murray to follow in the footsteps of Lamar Jackson, of course, but Murray should have the pieces he needs to take a leap forward in 2020."
AZCardinals,fqgi3gy,t3_gisius,1589346853.0,">Loser: Tight end streamers against the Arizona Cardinals

>If you played daily fantasy football or chose to stream your tight ends on a week-to-week basis in standard fantasy football, you knew about the Cardinals. Last year, Arizona allowed 309 points to opposing tight ends in PPR leagues, an average of 19.3 points per game. No other team was above 244, and the league average was 195 points, or just under 12.2 points per contest. It's the second-worst season any team has posted against tight ends over the past 20 years, trailing only the 2013 Cardinals. Everybody from T.J. Hockenson to Ross Dwelley had their best games of the season against Arizona.

>Vance Joseph-led defenses don't always know what to do with tight ends -- the Broncos ranked 26th against tight ends during his two years as Denver's coach -- but the Cardinals did something to address the problem this offseason by drafting Isaiah Simmons with the No. 8 overall pick. They've suggested that the talented Clemson defender will begin his NFL career at linebacker, where he's likely to see plenty of action against tight ends in coverage. Arizona has managed to get the least out of athletic, hybrid defenders like Deone Bucannon and Haason Reddick in years past, but Simmons could very well ruin one of the easiest exploits in fantasy football."
