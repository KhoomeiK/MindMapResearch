creepyPMs,fpki7vb,t3_gdsz7a,1588695155.0,"“Why you judge people on what they like?”

Because some people like sick shit. I hate this new thing we’re doing where we’re not supposed to shame people for their kinks. I’m sorry, but if your kink is watching real life women fuck horses, then you absolutely should be shamed for that."

Why tf is she letting her dog into other people’s yards in the first place?? Walking is for the side walks."

fatlogic,fpioq1g,t3_gdnfif,1588645365.0,"No, you’re not just a lump of fat. That’s what the HAES thinks. That you’re defined by your size. You are a human being with the ability to take care of your body and lose weight for a happier and healthier life."
TooAfraidToAsk,fphed3k,t3_gdgpt6,1588619786.0,"In the end, you’re free to go where you want, but without further context it sounds like you’re mom is just looking out for you and wants you to be ok in the finance area."
TooAfraidToAsk,fphdz8q,t3_gdh1iz,1588619585.0,"Stop letting that be your focus. Just live your life like a normal person doing the things you like to do and you will probably find somebody. You can try online dating or hanging out at places where you meet people with the same interests. My main point is that if this is your main focus you may come off as too pushy or weird (a turn off for others) or you may end up jumping into a relationship that’s not good for you. Everybody wants love and affection, but there are plenty of things to enjoy in life. Don’t let being single be the sole reason you’re unhappy, because chances are when you get into a relationship it probably won’t bring you everything you think it will."
niceguys,fph6fy8,t1_fph5iu8,1588615794.0,"I don’t really care about dick size. I care about whether I have fun in bed, and that can be accomplished by a variety of sizes of dicks. That being said, I’ve had a couple sexual encounters where the guy was pressing into my cervix and I definitely did not enjoy."

It doesn’t make a difference if the car horn is legitimate (like trying to avoid an accident) or just somebody bring an asshole. Doesn’t make a difference if it’s directed at me or not. I’m glad I’m not a gun owner because I have this huge (probably irrational) fear that I’ll have a gun in the car and just start shooting at whoever honks their horn. I’m able to drive, but it’s definitely distressing."
TooAfraidToAsk,fph0qz4,t3_gdfr2p,1588612927.0,I mean it depends on what you consider to smell bad. I don’t really consider a guys natural scent (a little sweaty or not) to be a turn off. Sex smells like sweat and fluids from the body. Whether that smells bad or not is up for interpretation.
