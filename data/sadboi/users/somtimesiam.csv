I heard this thing a while back that said sad people were the one's who wanted others to be happy the most (I think it was in reference to Robbin Williams). Sometimes I imagine other people having the same feelings as me and get really sad that they have these (imagined) feelings of pain and immense sadness. I want to comfort them telling them they're wrong and are loved. Just a little thing to give me perspective. Everyone deserves kind words and gifts, including you and me."
