AskReddit,f52rnf1,t3_dmg0y2,1571952673.0,"Ooh I’ve been waiting for this moment.

My school went to shit from my junior to senior year of high school. There were two certain events that tore the community and I’ll go into thin below.

Our first scandal was supposedly how our male Latin teacher hooked up with our female Latin teacher during a school trip to Rome over the summer. No one really believed in it but the female teacher stopped going on school trips and eventually left town to go teach at another school. This is even worse considered the fact that he male Latin teacher was married. After the wife found out about the accusations, I think they divorced. He’s a pretty chill guy and he just f*cked up I guess. Last I heard he has a girlfriend/married and they’re happy. 

The other one was about a friend of mine who posted a picture of himself with a nerf gun and told his Snapchat story to “not go to school tomorrow”. Though it was obviously a joke. Though the school principal didn’t see the humor in it and expelled the kid. The kids parents were not happy though and sued the school. The students also went into a kind of uproar and did stupid shit like pull fire alarms and set trash cans on fire. We had a fire drill like every week and there was a hashtag thing going to free the kid or something. There was a huge safety concern though because our school was under construction and the entrances were never locked so kids would bring in firecrackers and sh*t straight from the parking lot without going through attendance. It even got so bad that the staff eventually expelled a kid for having a “hit list” full of students names. There was so much bad stuff going on at the school that our principal took a “break” and let the vice take control for the last semester before I graduated.

Fun times.

TL;DR- my married, male Latin teacher slept with my female Latin teacher.

TL;DR- my principal expelled a kid who posted a dark humorous Snapchat and caused an uproar upon the students and a lawsuit."
