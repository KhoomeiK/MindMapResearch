Maybe you can try that?
It helps to me sometimes"

The improvement for me started also when I eliminated perfectionism  from my life, nobody likes perfectionist and it stopped me from going forward."

So therapy didn‚Äôt help me because people who didn‚Äôt go through the pain they don‚Äôt know the scars and think that it is so easy to breathe through it or talk about it an everything will go away. No it won‚Äôt. How I learned to help myself to go through conflicts is to start loving myself. Love yourself unconditionally and that will make you strong. Accept yourself unconditionally and that will give you courage to deal with your past and future. Loving yourself gives you confidence to stand up for yourself. I wish you all the best, life is waiting for you don‚Äôt think about past."

1. U Srbiji ljudi previ≈°e slu≈°aju i gledaju i ƒçitaju politiku. 
2. Zastra≈°ivanje politiƒçara u medijima je veliko, i one fore ‚Äúkod nas je i dobro kako je u Grƒçkoj, Spaniji, pa tek neredi u Turskoj ...‚Äù to je takvo prodavanje magle da jadni ljudi treba da pobacaju svoje TVs u smeƒáe.
3. Uopste poznato; ‚ÄúNi≈°ta se ne isplati‚Äù kako to? Treba ne≈°to da se proba prvo pa da je ƒçovek siguran.
4. Prekvalifikovan sam ja da konobarim! Mnogo ljudi u Srbiji ima nisko razvijene radne navike i to ih zaustavlja. 
5. Bolje je ≈æiveti kod roditelja nego na kiriji- pa dokle? Zaradi i plati kiriju, trgni se malo. Ta besplatna stanovanja samo zadr≈æavaju mlade ljude. 

Generalno na≈°i ljudi koji dodju u inostranstvo veƒáinom uspesno ≈æive i rade. Znaci problem je u sredini, i u slu≈°anju ‚Äúrekla kazala‚Äù i politiziranja bez potrebe.
Na ≈æalost mlade generacije koje su shvatile problem odu da tra≈æe sreƒáu u inostranstvu jer su se dinosaurusi u Srbiji  ucvrstili na vlasti i dr≈æe Srbiju u prehistoric vremenu da bi opravdali svoje nesposobnosti."
