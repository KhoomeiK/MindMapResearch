Second: YOU’RE GONNA NEED TO SET ASIDE SOME TIME AND TRY TO READ ALL OF THIS BECAUSE I TRIED TO COVER EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW THE BASICS BUT IT’S HONESTLY PROBABLY IN A WIERD ORDER SO PLEASE READ ALL OF IT TO AVOID GETTING CONFUSED THANK YOOOOU

The si se ti te ni ne fi fe things are called cognitive functions, and they’re kinda what makes up your type.

The letters in ESFP are an abbreviation of sorts that act more like a name than anything and might sound a little convoluted at first. What you should understand is how function stacks work and I’ll try to lay it out for you.

There are 8 different functions and every type uses every one to a certain degree. The top 4 that you use are the most important ones that can explain a lot of your behavior. They’re the only ones that really matter for this explanation. As an ESFP, your top 4 go like this:

Se: Dominant Function, 1st function
Fi:  Auxiliary Function,  2nd function
Te: Tertiary Function,    3rd function
Ni:  Inferior Function,    4th function

You might be picking up some patterns right now, like how it alternates between “e” and “i” and how each one starts with a different letter.

The function’s names are like this:

Si: introverted sensing
Se: extroverted sensing
Ti: introverted thinking
Te: extroverted thinking
Ni: introverted intuition
Ne: extroverted intuition
Fi: introverted feeling
Fe: extroverted feeling

These names seem a little bit contradictory to your type’s name at first, but there’s a system to it. I’m sure you can guess how the functions were named though.

In terms of the type name letters system:

Introverted vs Extroverted is rather straightforward.

If your first function is Se, Te, Ne, or Fe, you’re an extrovert, using E at the start of the type’s name.

If your first function is Si, Ti, Ni, or Fi, you’re an introvert, using I at the start of the type’s name.


Sensing vs Intuitive is pretty easy too.

If your first or second function is Se or Si, you’re a sensor. The second letter of the type will be S.

If your first or second function is Ne or Ni, you’re an intuitive. The second letter of the type will be N.

Feeling vs Thinking is similar to S v I.


If your first or second function is Fe or Fi, you’re a feeler. The third letter of the type will be F.

If your first or second function is Te or Ti, you’re a thinker. The third letter of the type will be T.


Lastly, the whole “judging vs perceiving” thing is the weird one. J vs P changes all of a type’s functions. For example, ESTP and ESTJ don’t have any of their first four functions in common with each other. This is not the case for most of the other letters, so the J vs P thing is weird and needs a little getting used to.

People with Ne or Se as their 1st or 2nd function are perceivers, using the letter P as the fourth letter of their type name.

People with Fe or Te as their 1st or 2nd function are judgers, using the letter J as the fourth letter in their type name.

Function stacks alternate between introverted functions and extroverted functions, and both are necessary for typing someone. An S or N function always have to be next to a T or F function. Remember, we’re talking functions not letters. That means you can’t have pairings like Ni Ti, or Se Ni, they just don’t make sense in terms of the system. When typing someone, at the most basic level you can use their top 2 functions.

Se and Fi are your 1st and 2nd functions. You lead with Se, so you are immediately defined as ESxP, using x as a placeholder letter. We can determine your third letter by looking at your Fi, ESFP. Simple, right? It’s like a flowchart.

Here’s another example, but backwards. Let’s say someone’s first 2 functions are Te and Fi.
We can tell from the first one that they are ExTJ. Using the 2nd function, that solidifies them as ENTJ. Does that make sense so far?

Adding on to what I said before, functions each have an opposite. Fe is the opposite of Ti, Ni is the opposite of Se, Te is the opposite of Fi, and Si is the opposite of Ni. If you go back to your 4 function stack, you’ll see that your first 2 functions are mirrored with their opposites.

Se
Fi
Te
Ni

1 and 4 are opposites and 2 and 3 are opposites.

Opposites isn’t even really the best word for these pairs, they’re more so compliments to each other because they often accomplish similar tasks.

SPEAKING OF TASKS!

I’m going to try and tell you what each of these functions does because that’s where the real juice of this stuff lies. These descriptions are as honest as I can make them but a little exaggerated and satirical :)

Si: Responsible for assessing one’s internal condition and finding what’s comfortable and what works. Often associated with tradition and moms. Reliable to a T, will get stuff done but won’t have much fun unless you push them.

Se: Gets input from the world around them and their senses. Usually associated with active people and sports. Often gets very exited by attention. Function most likely to be promiscuous. ;)

Ti: Keeps someone’s internal logic in order. Walking bs detector, usually skeptical. Associated with nerds and mechanics. Stereotyped as socially inept and depressed.

Te: Imposes personal will over their environment through systems or theories. Associated with bosses, no-nonsense but occasionally kinda gullible.

Ni: Delves deeper into information, usually focused on one thing at a time, finding the stuff that no one else does by looking closely. Associated with detectives and therapists, and usually stereotyped as always looking at the future. Maybe they know too much.

Ne: Forms new ideas by making connections between existing ones and branching off from there, sometimes disguises itself as Se and visa versa. Brainstormy but often in a dumb way. Associated with mad scientists and imaginative children.

Fi: Keeps one’s internal values central. Less likely to bend themselves in order to please others. Can be quite domineering when their values or choices are at stake, often impulsive when in a bad mental place.  Associated with weirdos artists, anyone who goes by their heart.

Fe: Senses the energy of the group, maintains harmony for themselves and for everyone else. More likely to sacrifice their integrity to try and fit in with the group, sometimes quite oppressive or manipulative in ways one wouldn’t expect. Associated with popular kids, knights, and again, moms.

If you have any questions, let me know! This was really fun to write and I hope it clears some stuff up."

It’s really nice to listen to just about anything while I walk, even those dumb text-to-speech Reddit readings. If you can go 3 miles, about 45 minutes, it’s likely you can go 10 miles, about 3 1/2 hours. Getting a tracking app like Relive could provide motivation, but it’s not necessary. And let me tell you, getting up early just to walk around for the duration of the sunrise is one of the most fulfilling and healing things I’ve ever done, especially when I’m in a bad headspace. It will make you feel great knowing you did it and seeing all of those colors flooding the sky can really cut through a lot of haze.
