And that's the thing about EDs or disordered eating, you don't have to look a certain way to have one. You don't even necessarily have to be eating in a certain way to have one.

I've been struggling for four years with disordered eating. Restriction, over exercising, bingeing, etc. But since Christmas I've done no exercise and been eating 'normally' - to anyone it would appear I'm fine. I do enjoy cooking and I do enjoy eating. 

But do I beat myself up after meals, feel guilty, hate my body, think about food and my next meal 90% of the time? Yes.

EDAnonymous,fpi0rjw,t3_gdkf8c,1588631412.0,"Firstly I wouldn't paint body positivity with the same brush as haes.

One thing that has helped me is to realise that as a person, your body and mind are not and should not be considered as completely separate things. They make you whole as a person and they should be in harmony with each other, not battling against each other.

 Therefore body positivity is recognising that your body is a intricate part of what makes you you. And it's not about the aesthetics necessarily. It's the fact that your body is a sum of parts all working together to keep you alive, and it enables you to do amazing things, like hug your loved ones, play music, draw, do sport, read etc.

Hope this helps :)"

- it feels worse than your ED

- you never feel ""ready"" for it

- it doesn't just click and happen overnight

- choosing to recover isn't enough, literally at every thought, choice or meal you have to defy every ED thought your brain is screaming and you have to do the opposite. You feel shit but do the recovery option anyway, and then you feel even shitter afterwards. 
 

I'm just gonna say, you've got this. 💪You're gonna have good days and bad days and even weeks, and that's okay!
Think about where you are now compared to in the depths of your ED. Besides gaining weight, what else have you gained?
For me it was my period (so my bone health will be so much better), not feeling cold all the time even in summer, and actually having the mental capacity to enjoy spending time with people and not thinking about food 110% of the time. 

I'm currently semi-relapsing too, but also have the clarity to see how if I get caught in an ED spiral, I don't think I'll manage to get out again. And that fear of being trapped in my ED keeps me from relapsing completely. 

In terms of how you feel in your body, just remember this body now is just your ""recovery bod"". It's not the body you'll have forever. Bodies change and especially in recovery the way your body stores fat etc. is very different to how it would if you hadn't had an ED.

It's amazing you have a team - use them! You have a lot of support and you can do this. Try to keep in perspective why you started recovery in the first place.

Btw check out MegsyRecovery on YouTube, she has tonnes of videos about quasi-recovery, gaining weight, relapses, etc. Her videos have literally saved me.

- getting your bone health back

My advice would be eat a few small meals regularly throughout the day, if you don't have the appetite for full meals. Not only will it help maintain your weight, it means your body will physically be satiated so you won't run the risk of binge urges.

Try to keep in mind all the positives you've gained from being stable and healthy - all the mental and physical benefits and what you've been able to achieve during recovery.

Yes this could be a slippery slope if you let it be, but the self awareness you have and the fact that you have reached out for help early is a really good sign, and that you're willing to make changes to prevent yourself from getting worse!

It's super fun! I'd definitely recommend trying it if you have an ice rink where you live. There are lots of development teams etc for new players."
