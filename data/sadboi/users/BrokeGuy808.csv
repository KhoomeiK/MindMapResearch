BipolarReddit,fpf5jbi,t3_gd28bk,1588562296.0,"If it’s any help, I’ll say the first 9 months of me being diagnosed (diagnosed April 2019), were the most scary and unnerving months I’d experienced in my young life. Similar to you, I was diagnosed by my therapist while having a manic episode with psychotic features, one in which I really should’ve been hospitalized. Also similar to you, it sorta forced me to completely reevaluate my life and realize that some of the career paths I was looking into were probably non compatible with me leading a stable life. 

But In the now year since then, I’ve learned so much more about myself and how this disorder affects me, I’ve learned how medication, while not a godsend, allows me to manage my episodes far better than I ever could before, I’ve learned how having a close support network of friends and family along with therapy keeps me from losing myself in my own thoughts, how although the life I imagined for myself prior to being diagnosed may not come to fruition, the multitude of options I have in life are truly immense, and I personally feel are considerably more consistent with what I actually want to accomplish with these short years/decades we have on Earth. 

Take time to grieve your past undiagnosed life, eventually you’ll find that this disorder ain’t necessarily all that bad when treated with the respect it demands, and may even allow you to excel in ways you haven’t even realized. I’m assuming you’re 18-21 years old like I am, and with that something else I realized was that adult life is literally just beginning for us, we have our entire lives ahead of us still, and to think we are only fit for one career or job in that lifetime simply limits ourselves to an astoundingly acute degree. 

Life’s too damn imaginative, vast, and unpredictable to plan out, and taking it as is, in its crazy self day by day, might just allow you to accomplish things unfathomable to your own prior beliefs.

I wish you well going forward, and please never forget you’re not alone in your struggles, as isolating and estranged as it may make you feel. I’m glad I was fortunate enough to be diagnosed at such a relatively young age, because now I can truly work on myself, instead of letting this disorder work me. Keep on moving ahead, one day you’ll look back on this period of your life with pride, for it forced you to face life, all its spikes and dips, and learn to not only take it, but to direct it in your own way."

Just consider how their legitimate concerns and problems are completely overlooked, and how the political field/language is so stupidly esoteric lest you personally devote time to understanding it, which by the way ain’t exactly easy.
