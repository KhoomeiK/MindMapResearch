Look into laws on your local area; sometimes a 16 or 17 year old can live independently if they’re in an extreme situation.

If you get thrown out before you’re able to use your savings to move out, get to a shelter immediately. Make friends if you can and build a good relationship with a social worker. See if you can get into a single room occupancy ASAP since those tend to be a little better than living in a shelter.

Your safety comes first but when you’re able to come out and move out all at once, things will be amazing. Hang in there."

She was featured in Tiger King where first season’s main character and exotic animal zoo owner Joe Exotic accuses her of murdering her missing husband and mishandling t he animals (I don’t think they included this in the show but she admits on at least one BCR video that she used to breed cubs in a misguided attempt at conservation, and Joe deceptively presents a small attachment to the larger tiger enclosure as a “tiny cage” - this “tiny cage” has two doors. They open the outer one, put the meat in, close the outer door, and open the inner door to allow the tiger to eat. These are also frequently used to administer sedative-laced meat to the cats when a veterinary procedure needs to be done).

That said, the evidence pointing to Carole murdering her husband is overwhelming and the reason much of the conversation with Joe takes place via phone from the jail he served time in (no spoilers; you can google that) is a hell of a lot worse imho."

At your age, raising a C to an A within the term is also probably an acceptable achievement to include if you did that.
