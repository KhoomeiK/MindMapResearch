britishproblems,fp6hs8a,t3_gbf8q3,1588352569.0,"I‚Äôve worked in rescue for years. The priority is getting the best home possible for the animal so that they don‚Äôt end up getting returned but also the safety of the public and other animals. The reasons that animals come in for rehoming is vast but a lot of the time they have some behavioural issues that contributed them being given up. People expect these perfect normal dogs but a lot of the time they have issues that need further training and work, a lot of people can‚Äôt be bothered. All dogs have behavioural assessments from qualified behaviourists so if they have specific rehoming requirements it‚Äôs for a good reason. A lot of dogs are strays that we would have no background history on so how can we assess if they are ok with children? If we say they are and then the kid gets hurt it‚Äôs the charity that it will come back on. Also dogs shouldn‚Äôt be left for extended periods of time on their own so if you work full time and don‚Äôt go back during the day or get a dog walker then you shouldn‚Äôt be getting a dog. 

As for fees do you have any idea how much it costs to run a rehoming centre? All animals are vaccinated, flea‚Äôd, wormed, microchipped,  neutered and any other vet treatment. Then add to that normal business costs all paid for by donations, they are not for profit and often don‚Äôt have any government funding. A lot of the time they are on walking a very fine line as to whether they can keep running. 

I know this I poorly formatted and jumps all over the place but this post and particularly some comments boiled my piss and I just needed the rant a bit!! People honestly have NO IDEA about the realities of rehoming and seem to have a rose tinted glasses on or only think about what they‚Äôre getting from it. Please stop and have a proper think about it from the charities perspective and what is truly in the best interest of the animals. After all we do have the same goal which is to give animals the second chance they deserve. If anyone wants to ask any questions and get honest answers I will do my best to answer them.

Edit: lol ok downvote all you want but that‚Äôs the truth of the matter, stay ignorant."

It can get very ‚Äúcliquey‚Äù sometimes and there‚Äôs a lot of know-it-all type people who think their way to do things is the only way. These type of people also like to criticise everything you do without actually giving any advice or constructive criticism just being mean for the sake of it. Bullying is quite a big problem in the equine world sadly.
Rottweiler,flcyi2b,t3_fnzcer,1585051349.0,You could teach them ‚Äútouch‚Äù.

trashy,fkwsuhf,t1_fkwltm6,1584604324.0,"We can. The animal welfare act is a piece of legislation that is meant to give animals more protection against neglect and cruelty so that people can be more easily prosecuted. Only problem is it can be quite subjective (eg animals used in farming) and it isn‚Äôt very high on the list of police priorities to enforce so it is mainly used by animal charities such as the RSPCA who prosecute people privately. Obviously this takes a lot of time, money and you need solid strong evidence. Used to work for an animal charity and with RSPCA inspectors and the amount of hoops they had to jump though for a conviction is ridiculous."
