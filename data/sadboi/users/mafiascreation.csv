He didn't demand more time with me than I could give, didn't get mad when I didn't answer texts for hours and understood my want to be alone (because he has that want too!). A few years later we bought a house in which we have separate bedrooms, two living rooms (so we can both be alone) and we have 2 cats. 

So I guess I always expected to end up alone, which *almost* worked out."
