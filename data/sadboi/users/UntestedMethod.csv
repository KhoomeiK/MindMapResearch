DesignMyRoom,fqx6e48,t1_fqx2a1y,1589726818.0,"Hey, glad you found my comment helpful!

Bean bag... I mean I like them because they are super comfy and convenient, but they are also super casual... like basement rumpus room or college dorm/house style casual more than mature main living room.  I'd probably have it as part of the lounge space in my bedroom (since you're having roommates, it's nice to have a good private lounge and workspace in your bedroom.)

I'd be careful with the album covers and vintage posters unless they're special collector's items - it's great for a man cave or college vibe, but can easily come across as immature if it's not carefully done.  If you're a record collector, definitely showcase the turntable and some favourite albums somewhere (a dedicated pedestal for a turntable/stereo system is totally appropriate imho.)  Vintage posters would really depend what they are - movies, sports, and comic book posters for the man cave, but more worldly culture type vintage posters can sometimes fit in the main area amidst a collection of other worldly culture type deco.

Again it's all about personal taste and what vibe you're going for - since you said minimalist bachelor, I am thinking a step more mature than the typical college roommate house and that you might like to entertain and occasionally impress guests."

DesignMyRoom,fqx0fq5,t3_glcrlc,1589722768.0,"You mentioned you're already roommates - so as a  general starting point you might talk about what you like or don't like about your current setup and think about adapting that to your new space.

Size of budget for furniture can dictate a lot about what the options will be.  Matching sets of furniture can look really nice and give cohesion to a room (vs piecing together this and that.)  A futon can be a good choice if you plan to ever have overnight guests, but it can be tough to find a really comfortable one.  Comfy leather couch and a good quality chair or two can make a good comfortable gaming/TV room.  Don't forget the coffee table and end table so you have somewhere to put the drinks or whatever.

Bachelor pad kitchen table and chairs can usually be pretty basic since we're not often hosting family dinners or dinner parties.  You will probably want to set some budget for pots, pans, utensils, etc if you don't have that stuff already.

Decorating will depend a lot on your personal style.  Artwork is always nice and I think a key thing here is to keep it authentic to your refined tastes.  A couple houseplants will add a touch of class and a lot of women seem to like it when guys have plants.  If you're all big readers, you might include a book shelf in the main living area since books can be a good conversation piece (I can easily see one on that wall between the window and kitchen area.)

For lighting, having lamps is nice for the evenings when you don't want full-bright overheads - consider floor-standing lamps if you want more versatility or won't have end-tables.  Accent lighting will probably depend a lot on what style you choose for the rest of the deco.  LED strip lighting can look pretty classy and minimalist when tastefully done (key point is to hide the diodes so you only see the light emitted.)"

I'll add a note about working with friends as there is a common saying to be careful mixing business and friendship.  If you do contract work for friends, it's important to keep elements of your business and friendship separate and don't allow the friendship part to make the business part too casual.  Still sign contracts, etc. if they ask why, tell them it's to protect both your business and your friendship by clarifying any expectations upfront to avoid any disagreements down the line.  Ultimately both business and friendship are relationships, throw money into the mix and people can start acting weird.  When I was younger I found some friends didn't seem to understand that when I was freelancing it was more than just a hobby I was doing for fun so they thought it was no problem to ask me to do projects for them for free - had to clarify for them that my free time is for my own interests."

Sounds like your father sees more value in the quick n cheap sites which I'm sure one could easily make good money in.

freelance,fo7tnj4,t3_g65b8v,1587584352.0,"In my experience freelancing (many years full-time and continuing as a side-hustle fir more years while employed full-time), you will come across all kinds of people who want to do business with you, some are serious, some just like to throw ideas around, some have lots of money and want to pay you, others have little or no money and expect you to work for free or as part of some partnership, etc. The point is that there are all kinds of people trying to do business out there and as a freelancer you get/need to choose who you do business with. Learn to identify red flags and how to read personalities for possible troublesome clients. Choose your clients carefully, write and sign contracts that define scope of work, payment schedule, and limitations (ie. boundaries and explicitly stating things that won't be included), include early-termination clauses that don't screw you out of getting paid for work completed-to-date. Collect a down-payment up front so the client shows they are serious and willing to pay.

Pay. Attention. To. Red. Flags.

Opt out of doing business with people who show signs they may be trouble. As a freelancer many of us have very little protection for ourselves so we  need to be extra cautious with how we spend our time.

For this client of your's, I would have dropped them almost immediately and definitely after they ghosted me. If I was you I would invoice them and GTFO, family friend or not they need to show you more respect.  Refuse to do any more work for them until they pay outstanding invoices and once all invoices are settled, terminate the contract and don't look back.

The family friend part raises another point about being careful doing business with friends, kind of conventional wisdom really but still important. Reminder that as a freelancer you get to choose who you do business with. If you do business with friends and family, I find it helps to treat them as much like any other client as possible - friendship is friendship, business is business - the serious business+friends understand this and tend to approach it the same way of business is business."

AbsoluteUnits,fo5atpg,t1_fo3tiiy,1587521289.0,"VPN usually used for security purposes.  It is commonly associated with hiding a real IP or masking as a different geographic region.  Another main use is to have an IP address that doesn't change and that multiple computers can use simultaneously.  Similar to how all computers on a LAN have one public IP, all computers connected to the VPN have the IP address of the VPN; in this sense it could also be comparable to an apartment building where everyone has the same street address.

A practical and common use for this in terms of server security would be to configure the server to allow access only from the VPN's IP.  For example in a business setting, there may be a file server that many staff need remote access to.  Rather than allowing any IP address (do you leave your front door unlocked?) or maintaining the list of each staff's IP separately, the server (or firewall) would be configured to allow the VPN IP and staff would be given the VPN software and instructions how to connect to the VPN.

In terms of file sharing, definitely not faster.  You'd actually be losing speed since the traffic is routed through the VPN server.

Bragging rights? Maybe? I think people who know what it is would kinda just be like ""so what?"" and people who don't know what it is would probably just think it's overly technical nerd stuff.  The real bragging rights for home/hobby use would usually be in what you're using the VPN for."

design_critiques,fnstdl4,t3_g3porj,1587228428.0,"A few things stand out right away (currently on mobile)

- the background images in the hero element at the top could be improved - text on top of the sharp flash of bright pink roses is hard to read, that image is just a little too busy and in your face. Consider giving the text some breathing room in those elements. Having the wreath hanging on a door is fine for a secondary product shot, but looks amateurish as any kind of featured image. 

- more product selection - if she only sells one kind of wreath but with different options, consider splitting some of those options into separate products - something of ""presets"". People like to feel like they have at least some selection at every stage and don't always want to ""start from scratch"" to fully customize. Plus this approach allows her to feature a more diverse portfolio.  Think like a customer - are you more interested in ""a wreath"" or ""a special occasion wreath"" - this easily opens up your marketing options as well since you can feature specific products for specific target markets.

- the font is not a good choice. Generally any font with too much ""character"" will look amateurish as a main font - especially when the same font is used for titles, body, menu, everywhere. It's good to choose 2 complimentary fonts - one for main titles and one for body; menus unless carefully designed would usually use same font as body with maybe slight variation like bolding. The title font can have a bit of ""character"" but it needs to match the overall style of the site or else it will look tacky. Fancy fonts are generally not the best way to add personal flair to a site."

Start setting up the ""firing her"" part early, even giving her a chance to redeem herself and start cooperating if you want.  Remind them of the clause in the contract where it says ""2 rounds of revision"" - elaborate exactly what that means - she can send you no more than 2 emails, each one can contain a list of revisions, and feedback received in any other format will be ignored.  If she wants another phone call and you're feeling generous, give her it but set clear time limit and make it clear that it is the last phone call she gets.  If you want you can offer to not count the multitude of feedback messages she has already sent or you could say all that counts as a round of feedback and she can email one more list of changes and that's it what she gets it what she gets after that.  She needs to realize that you need to wrap this project up as soon as possible and that you won't tolerate any more of her crap.

Contracts are written and signed for the exact purpose of defining expectations and setting boundaries.  If someone signs a contract does not abide by the boundaries set out in it, they are in violation and it is totally valid to terminate.  The tricky part is that the contract must be clearly worded so there will be no ambiguity or opportunity to bend, stretch, or ""misinterpret"" in any way.

Freelancing is tough, there are some bad clients out there and there are some amazing clients out there.  One key thing is to choose who you work with carefully.  If you get any red flags, address them as quickly and clearly as possible - bring it up diplomatically with the client (use non-violent communication techniques, ask questions of why they are ignoring your requests, etc)  If no resolution can be found, then this client is most likely not worth your time and you should start working on your exit plan - build the case (justified reasoning for termination); get paid for work completed to date (good to write the termination clauses of your contract in a way that you won't take a bad hit even if you choose to terminate); and finally terminate services.  If they try to harass you after, then call it exactly that - harassment, which is illegal.

This client sounds like they might be the type of person who might take to slander, etc if you do end up firing them.  Slander is illegal, so keep that in mind.  Also remember this is one bad client compared to however many good clients you have worked with - don't let this one make you think badly of yourself.  Sounds like you are stretching your limits going above and beyond for them and they are showing zero appreciation."
