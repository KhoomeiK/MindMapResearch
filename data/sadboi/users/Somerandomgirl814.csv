selfharm,fqllkkj,t1_fqlkp3a,1589461113.0,"Maybe you should try the letter thing a redditor suggested you on another post of yours. You can write down what you want to tell them. And leave it somewhere where they could find it while you're at school or another activity. In this way, you could say what you mean without stressing about their first reaction. Say something like ""I've wanted to say this for some time but I didn't know how to start. I wrote this letter to express myself better"" then explain how you've been feeling. Tell them you can't keep doing it like that, and you need help. When you'll come back you will talk about it. That's my idea. I think you should try, because, with you still being a teenager, you can really get help on your own, you need an adult. Be it your parent, relative, teacher, counselor, whoever you trust"
