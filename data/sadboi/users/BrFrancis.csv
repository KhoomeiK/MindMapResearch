Even if it was written in python, then either the infected computer has to already have python installed, or they had packaged the python runtime along with their script or even compiled it into a executable.

So many of your questions relate to how things basically work that it isn't likely anyone will answer them.

How does one host a website? How does one execute code? How does one ensure that they don't accidentally break an os by manipulating files?

You considered the hosting the website part. Sure, whatever vm or cheap hardware, in the cloud or even portable. Torrent and onion are designed to work in ways where ip addresses don't matter so much... It's not like www, doesn't use dns...

But how a website is hosted, www or onion or... Is not specific to ransomware, or any malware...

If the VM does not contain any personal information or passwords saved in its browser or anything like that, then the only way some JS is gonna affect you windows host is by breaching the visualization..

Which has been demonstrated in the past to be possible, and then quickly patched against. It's a pain in the rear to accomplish.

Also, malicious Javascript doesn't have to stay only within the browser. One could use it as a part of a multi stage attack, using a JS vulnerability to drop an executable and infect a system.

The likelihood of this occurring on a Linux based browser is small but nonzero. Most Malware binaries are targeted at windows.

If you are taking these precautions because you suspect the site to be malicious and want to study it, then I would think you should be able to kill the vm long before an vm breaching was even possible, as those attacks generally take a while to work the exploit if it's even possible"

the translucent ones are just dye. The opaque ones started as something like a 50/50 mix Tenacious flexible and  AnyCubic Basic Grey , with dye and later some of the aqua resin mixed in trying to get a more saturated color..

I ended up with a failed print due to not completely mixing the dye in though.. that's when I swapped in the AnyBasic clear with the Tenacious ( \~50/50 eyeballed ) and then dyed blue .. was like 20 drops or so, and a few drops black.. with the resevoir filled to the the fillet ( about \~100ml? )"

Sometimes trying to explain to someone saying you're wrong why they're so wrong illuminates the situation further than either of you alone could."
todayilearned,f75ncxx,t1_f75i0xx,1573417082.0,"I think the overall effect depends on the rest of the context of your upbringing. r/aftergifted is full of tales of being praised as being smart. 

I would often succeed very quickly at new things and was praised how smart I was, a genius, by my mother. But my father would comment on the thing.. The thing is pretty good, I like this detail. Can you take it further? Can you add X? 

I largely disregarded the ""smart"" praise. I never really believed it. I did things better than my peers, and that was all. 


 I took pride in my work, and if it sucked that was OK, I  could try again. I could take it further.

I had a lot of problems sticking to anything, but that's just other things I guess."
