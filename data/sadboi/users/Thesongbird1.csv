During easier patterns go HARD, give those streams your all, its free points. Know the beat pattern of the song and stick to it, being slightly off beat will ruin your score.

I found that for me, the fastest way to improve was repetition + diversity. 

repetition: find your favorite songs and try to improve their scores many times. this teaches you what leads to improved scores.

diversity: playing a large diverse group of songs teaches you how to pass more of what ever may come your way in the future.

 If you cant do a hard part of a song, ive found you will learn how to do it over time just by playing different songs. If a song gives you a ""easy part"", GO HARD on it. Running will help increase your endurance.

I now have giant arm muscles. Favorite maps: KillerBeast (puds), Anomaly (???), all of those ""french-sounding"" ranked songs, Abyss of Frobenoid (hardest version)"
