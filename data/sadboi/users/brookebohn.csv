BPD,fp41e71,t3_gazy08,1588289784.0,"i feel like we are too hard on ourselves in these scenarios. people who don't have bpd also experience stuff like this. they get attached to people because they spend SO much time with them and fall in love super quick. we just have the shitty part where when they abandon us we feel like we're going to literally die. 

yes, our bpd can be blamed for our desire to harm ourselves and rely on substances to cope because our emotions are just TOO much. the abandonment can make us feel like we're physically dying on the inside and out. and shit like that will hurt you, resulting in PTSD-like symptoms. 

and maybe you weren't soulmates, but just because you have bpd does not invalidate the feelings that you had for him. they were real feelings."

I used to be as extreme as you, it‚Äôs gotten easier with time and of course working on myself. 

My advice, stop talking to people who you have romantic intentions with entirely for awhile. Focus on yourself. Solidify your sense of self. Find what you love, what you want to do for the rest of your life on your own (career, hobbies, maybe live in a cool house with 5 dogs, anything), and focus on that. 

When you see yourself getting obsessed, focus on those things. Things that you are hopeful for for yourself. Love can be one of those things, but love takes a lot of time, patience, and the right person (which is the hardest thing of all). I‚Äôm not sure how old you are, but I‚Äôm sure you have plenty of time, and you just need to remind yourself of that. 

I‚Äôm 24, and I constantly obsess about finding ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù I rush into anything where I get affection. It‚Äôs bitten me in the ass a lot and I find myself becoming better at rationalization and also learning when to step away. 

I‚Äôve had 8 failed relationships in 6 years, it was definitely a learning lesson. But the best thing I did was take 2 years to myself and learn who I am. 

Figure out who you are and learn to love yourself."

FP seems to be on the toxic side of a relationship. it is perfectly normal to become obsessed with someone you're dating, but being able to not let it cloud your vision i think is what sets a partner away from the FP definition."

Gotta find boundaries that work and focus on yourself first, even if you find it difficult. 

For example, I just broke up with him earlier this week. We‚Äôre still talking and mentioned getting back together in the future, but I‚Äôm teaching myself how to not think about him all the time and occupy my time with things I love to do for myself instead. Also reminding myself that people are free to leave at anytime, so getting deeply obsessed with someone isn‚Äôt healthy. 

It‚Äôs hard for people like us to date healthily and not go insane, but it is possible with a lot of effort."

I lacked boundaries with this one as we literally saw each other everyday. It was just a come over or I‚Äôm coming over and we spent all our free time together. Usually I don‚Äôt let that become a thing because I get too attached and too obsessed, but everything was going so well, what could go wrong?

I was worried about breaking up with him originally, but I had to take away the emotions I had for him and really look at it with cold hard logic. Which now makes sense when I do it again. I know I‚Äôll be okay in a few days/a week and I‚Äôm just feeling an immediate sense of loss."

I didn‚Äôt realize I was unintentionally overloading my boyfriend with my emotions by venting to him almost everyday. He‚Äôs not speaking to me right now... he says I did nothing wrong and we‚Äôre going through an unhealthy time right now, but I know I messed up. 

Now.. hopefully, he‚Äôll take me back, and I know that I‚Äôll have to limit the venting to him. I want him to be my best friend, but I can‚Äôt keep telling him how things effect me every single time. 

I just saw it as a way for him to understand me, but instead it caused him to want no contact for however long it takes him to approach me. It sucks.

But remember, as long as you‚Äôre aware of it and take a step back when you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed yourself, breathe and sort out your emotions before you convey them onto other people. You got this. I believe in you."

I told him that‚Äôs how I felt and he actually reassured the hell out of me and told me I‚Äôm basically stuck with him. 

I think that we think these scenarios because it‚Äôs so easy for the brain to go to those places when we‚Äôve been abandoned or neglected in the past. I‚Äôve had everyone leave me in one way or another; my dad would disappear for months, my mom would escape via alcohol and I wouldn‚Äôt recognize her, all my past relationships ended because of them leaving me. I‚Äôm not sure what your past is like, but that‚Äôs what mine is like and which is why I automatically go to the ‚Äúholy fuck, they‚Äôre gonna leave me and they‚Äôve been lying to me this whole time.‚Äù Takes a lot of emotional rationalization to bring me back down to a safe baseline of not being scared of abandonment."
