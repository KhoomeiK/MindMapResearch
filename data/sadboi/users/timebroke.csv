It's also important to remember that comedy has a lot to do with personal experience, so if you don't have a vagina then there's a high possibility that you have a low tolerance for how many pussy jokes you can take. And there's nothing wrong with that.

However, you have to remind yourself that there are some vagina havers who like these jokes more than you do.

As for male one trick ponys, don't you worry there are plenty of examples.


Jeselynik, every edgy kids favourite comedian, is also very popular but has a very particular set of jokes( which is actually kind of cool in my opinion), namely sock value one liners. Think of a rotation between pedophilia, incest and violence. That's a one trick pony but he is most applauded by casuals and comedy nerds alike.

Joe Rogan, as well. The very famous ""are you triggered?"" routine seems to be very lucrative.

Being a boring comedian is fine. A lot of people like boring comedy, since they aren't that well versed in the medium. That's fine.

No one says masculinity is bad. Taking care of your family is considered a masculine attribute, but it isn't toxic in itself.
 

Also, it's always "" *boys* don't cry"", ""let's take it outside *if you are a man*"",  "" you are wearing make-up? What are you *a sissy*?"". No one is going around  saying ""let's gossip about Jessica or you aren't a girl"". Being a woman isn't being gatekeeped by these toxic behaviours."

They don't. r/askfeminist always has to make this clear because every second post is asking about that.



>It's what you've been told, not what you've seen.

It's actually what I 've seen. The other day I was watching an otherwise lovely guy talking about MRA who I 'm sure is genuine in his pursue of helping men, but when asked about toxic masculinity did a whole routine of mental gymnastics to say he doesn't agree with the concept only to conclude that he just doesn't like the word. That's just being reactionary to feminists just for being reactionary and indicative of a person who hasn't interacted with feminism in good -faith. Also, another speaker was this woman whose name I don't remember, but who made a reaction to Natalie's video about men and claimed, among other things that women weren't actually oppressed in the past (which is something the aforementioned guy also claimed).


Even if a genuine conversations concerning men's interests is happening in those circles it is poisoned by this anti-feminist context, when the movement I am envisioning is one that works side by side with feminism. Personally, I fail to see how this kind of mras are going to abolish mandatory draft when they squirm at the concept of male sacrifice being labelled as toxic, which it also happens to be. Or, for example, how they are planning to combat the unfair custody of children without encouraging men to become the primary caregivers. To do that you would have to see that the problem all along was a system that pressures women to become the primary caregivers, which I doubt the mras I have encountered are able to see."

What I see happening is a lot of anti-feminists hijacking men's rights or rather hiding behind them and creating a reactionary agenda rather than actually advocating change for men( all men, because they also lack intersectionality a lot of the time).

And toxic masculinity is only part of the puzzle.
