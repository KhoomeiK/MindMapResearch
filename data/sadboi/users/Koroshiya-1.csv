I felt the full weight of Noctis' sacrifice on a personal level, watching him give his life for his people felt like losing both a friend and a part of *myself*. The emotional immersion in FFXV is one of its strongest attributes, I hadn't felt such strong emotional investment in the protagonist's fate since Final Fantasy X. It's not for everyone, but the themes of loyalty, determination, and selflessness really hit home for me. Even though it's a fantasy setting, the core relationships between the main cast feel very familiar and genuine, their friendship is nuanced and believable. This will probably sound stupid, but... I think because I have no friends IRL, playing FFXV made me feel like I had a crew who would stand by me through anything, for the entire duration of the game. I played it at the perfect time in my life when I really needed a story like this to get me through some difficult things, and it affected me in a way no other game ever has."
DID,fr44xus,t3_gm8qy8,1589875955.0,"I'm the host and I have absolutely *no idea* how gender works, so I identify as agender. (Or sometimes genderqueer as an umbrella term, although genderfluid would probably be more accurate... idek anymore \*sigh\*) I *really* don't understand what people mean or how people know when they say they are male/female or a man/woman, so it makes sense to me to identify as agender because I truly can't relate to the idea of choosing one or both or ANY gender identities. I'm also asexual and I think that factors into this as well. If I could design an ideal body to exist in, it would be one with zero sex characteristics - sex and gender just aren't things I have any attachment to or interest in. I do experience gender dysphoria and feel mismatched with this female body, but then *nothing* about this body matches the ""me"" I see internally. To me this body is merely the vessel through which I interact with the outside world, and my gender not matching my biological sex is just one issue among many when it comes to my physical body not representing what I feel like inside.  


We have other alters that are agender, as well as alters that are female, male, nonbinary and genderfluid. Collectively we've agreed to go by she/her pronouns since we're in a female body and that's less complicated and confusing for people talking to us, but we don't mind they/them pronouns either (especially having DID, so they/them pronouns have a double meaning.) We often list ourselves as ""Female"" on social media profiles and the like because it's just not worth the effort to explain all this to most people we aren't close to personally. Overall this is something we still struggle to understand about ourselves even 15+ years into being aware of our system. It's a very complex, sensitive, tricky subject and our understanding of it has changed over time, and it'll probably change more from here. We also experience this same confusion when it comes to our age(s), but I'll save that can of worms for another post.

Without going specifically into trauma stuff, since that would almost certainly be much more than he can handle right now, explain to him that this is how his mind developed to keep him safe and strong to ensure his survival. Try explaining that even though this seems sudden and scary that he's existed this way his entire life, it's just that he's become aware of it now. And now that he has that awareness, true healing can begin for the first time.

Basically, frame things in a positive and non-threatening way. It might be helpful, especially for a little, to explain being part of a DID system as being part of a supportive family, or a team of friends working together. That alters are there to contribute resources and skills that one single identity might not be able to provide by themself. Let him know it's okay and normal to feel afraid/upset about finding out he has DID, but with time and treatment he can come to understand this condition as a vital and even positive aspect of his life and identity.

If he reaches a point where he feels safe enough to do so, find a way he can get his thoughts and feelings out about all this. Journaling is great for that. He can write in a journal to his alters and vice versa, or use it the traditional way as a place to privately unburden himself of internal stress and fear. That would be something you could do alongside him with your own journal if you don't already have one. Being able to share that activity with you might help him feel less isolated. Let him know there are online communities like this one where he can read about others' experiences, and reach out for support or ask questions if he gets comfortable enough to do so. If any of this is overwhelming or scary to the point of making him feel unsafe/unstable, then wait until his therapist is informed about what's going on so they can properly guide him through this process. With you still being new to all this as well that makes it trickier to help support him through this - don't take the risk of overextending yourself for his sake so much that you lessen your own ability to cope or continue learning about your system.

We found him pretty realistic, especially in the last couple of seasons, but I agree with the above reply in that he's more a mix of typical protector and persecutor. (Though I should clarify that our system doesn't use the term persecutor, and that we classify most of what others refer to as ""persecutor"" alters as protectors to begin with.)  


There are different types of protectors, and Mr. Robot is the type who isn't afraid to engage in questionable tactics to achieve certain goals, even if those tactics seem super harmful or sketchy from the outside. During the last season a couple of our main protectors VERY strongly identified with Mr. Robot's desperation to keep Elliot separate from trauma memories. His focus on keeping Elliot in the dark to a fault was so real and familiar to us that we were left in tears for hours after watching the episode in which Elliot finally confronts his trauma/abuse memories. It's clear that even though Mr. Robot's actions have been dangerous, manipulative and hurtful, especially when neither Elliot nor the audience have full context for WHY he's done all this before the last few episodes, he cares deeply for Elliot and takes no pleasure in events playing out the way they did. I thought it was quite moving and realistic that as he gains more understanding of what all of this has cost them, he shows more empathy to Elliot and apologizes for things he felt he had to do, and makes it clear that he's done all of it to protect him (and by extension ""original"" Elliot) and to keep their system going. He's quite tragic and misunderstood, which I think is true for so many protectors IRL who engage in the more persecutory actions that make perfect sense to them internally, but come off as cruel or illogical externally. In others words he made choices in the best ways he knew how, to serve the ultimate goal of keeping other alters safe from trauma, but his choices were often harmful because they came from a dysfunctional place in the absence of treatment and support. That's extremely relatable and very realistic."

You said a young alter got real upset about these topics. I got stuck for a long, long time being angry and upset about terminology and discussions about integration after I first found out I had DID. I didn't understand that people speaking about ""parts of a whole"" wasn't personal and didn't negate my individuality, and it was hard for the rest of my system to see why I got so upset about it. It was really tough to not feel like my existence was being threatened when the topic of integration came up, and I also avoided owning any trauma history because it was too scary and painful.  


So I just wanted to say... reach out to that young alter, and any other alters who might be feeling like this, let her know she isn't wrong to feel this way but also that no harm is meant when people talk about ""parts"" or integration or trauma. The idea that it's okay to feel comfortable thinking and referring to yourself as a ""part"" is very much not a given. DID is vilified in pop culture and common discussion as crazy/delusional, weird, and wrong. We are taught that having DID or a trauma history makes us broken in some fundamental way when it isn't so, and we are not encouraged to feel anything but sadness and fear about it. I can promise you that alter needs help from the rest of her system right now, to understand that she doesn't have to feel alone with her negative feelings, and that there is more to being a system than negativity. Let her know you understand she is a real, valid person by reaching out to support her. You guys are learning together, and from each other. Let her know that if alters say ""I'm part of you, and you're part of me"" it's as a mutual, equal relationship of teamwork and family, and that nothing is ever going to erase that. Reassure her that she doesn't have to delve into trauma right now, especially not without a therapist to help you guys through it.

I left a reply in the linked thread that goes through my concerns with trying to make a game based around DID. The central problem here is that while the idea of minigames showing how switching works, visually depicting a system's alters and inner world, etc. sounds interesting, it would be irresponsible to make a game like that without reminding the player that DID is a trauma disorder. And trauma is not a ""fun"" subject to make a game about. It's an extremely delicate, emotional, deeply personal subject and that cannot and should not be left out of any fictional depiction of DID.  


You have designs for your characters, but do you understand the genesis of their condition? Do you truly feel you understand and know enough about DID to tell this story? If you want to help us educate people about DID, become an ally. You don't need to make a game to do that.

The bare bones parts about his grandfather dying, seeing his corpse, and feeling abandoned are probably true. It would make sense that this is one of the incidents in his early life that linked death and sexuality for him, but that's also such an ""easy"" answer that it makes me question it, if you know what I mean? Nilsen was full of stories like this, things that seemed to easily explain his actions and attractions. I don't know what specifically, if anything, caused the wires in his brain to cross the way they did. I suspect even without his grandfather's death he still would've become the same kind of killer, because it wasn't as simple as one or two things for him, it was everything, it was the way he related (or rather didn't relate) to other human beings, the way he interpreted social interactions, the way he felt entitled to attempt to own and dominate other people.

He also had a very bizarre story about nearly drowning when he was a child, being saved by an older boy and that boy molesting/assaulting him. He frames the experience in an uncomfortably romantic/erotic way that makes me doubt the truth of it as well. I think a lot of his stories and exaggerated accounts were probably fantasies, perhaps loosely inspired by real events but changed to make Nilsen the star and his feelings the most important aspect. It's classic narcissist behavior to interpret and reframe life events that way. His life stories always sounded so rehearsed and polished, like scenes in a film. I don't think he was ever truly honest about what ""made"" him the way he was, if there even is such a thing, and I don't think he even understood it himself.  


EDIT: he also claimed that his grandfather sexually abused him. I am an incest survivor myself and I know what that disgusting abuse does to your brain, how it permanently warps your view of sexuality and intimacy. Nilsen tried to seem like this abuse didn't bother or affect him much, and again frames it in a more romantic way. It's actually very disturbing.

There's a lot to be said, too, for the many often overlooked factors that contribute to how a person recovers from trauma or not. Factors that are often as involuntary as the experience of trauma itself, or at least not as simple as being able to choose better. Even in the richest countries in the world a person's income, class, location, etc. still frequently determines right off the bat what access they're going to have to diagnostic and treatment options. A person's genetics can make it harder for them to overcome certain types of psychological and behavioral issues like depression and addiction. It also matters hugely whether a person has a network of people around them willing and capable of supporting them after trauma in the short *and* long term. Then there's people like us who have DID and often don't even *know* we were traumatized until years down the road.  


I will always appreciate people who mean well, who come at this with a ""healing is possible no matter what happened to you and it's never too late to try to get better"" outlook. I think it can be really important for survivors to hear that. But the people who boil that down to a simple black and white choice, and then frame people who aren't yet functional as ""not trying"" or people who commit suicide as ""weak/selfish"" and that kind of BS, are indeed frustrating and hurtful. The vast majority of people just don't understand trauma or its effects, and don't understand how much it matters how they phrase things like this. It matters that people like you, who have been through it, are able to respond and give others a better idea of what it's actually like.

It gave me such feelings of excitement and anticipation, the building and exploration felt so immersive and limitless, it's probably some of the most fun I've ever had playing a game. This was back when Minecraft had very little of the bells and whistles it has now and despite the game having much more to actually *do* in it now, I can never have as much fun playing it now as I did back then. You know your life is sad when you feel like crying thinking about how much better it felt playing out a fictional life in Minecraft than it does living your real life now...

Why confess to something, especially something you might be deeply ashamed of or are now shocked that you were coerced into participating in, if no one can prove you even did it? If he did participate in the torture, and I feel certain he did, that's something he'd probably want to take to the grave. I think the vast majority of people would. Sexually torturing children - his friends and peers - is one of the most heinous things a person could possibly admit to, and it would make him an even bigger target of hatred and violence behind bars. That's ""deathbed confession"" type shit at *best*."
AskDID,fnygivo,t3_g4ivk7,1587362409.0,"There's been a lot of good answers already and I don't feel stable enough right now to address the main questions here, but I want to reiterate the fact that ""host"" is not another way to reference the body; a ""host"" is a type of alter, the alter(s) who fronts the most/deals with daily life, the body itself is not the host. And even host alters don't necessarily identify with the body's traits. Make sense?  


Also, of course your hurt is valid. Don't ever feel like you're just ""making it about yourself"" if something is hurtful to you. This is a really personal issue for you and it makes sense for this situation to have brought up difficult feelings. Your reaction and these questions are totally okay. I'd much rather someone voice their concerns this way in order to have everyone talk it out and understand where other people are coming from, rather than keep silent for fear of offending us. No one learns or grows that way. Thank you for bringing this up, and I really wish I felt able to respond more adequately right now."
DID,fncjy70,t3_g0xx9b,1586838672.0,"I originally stepped in as host in 2002 when the previous host went dormant, and I've been here ever since. Right out of the gate you need to know that being host is extremely difficult and demanding. There will be times that are so overwhelming that you'll want to quit. You will probably get very sick of having to answer to the body's name, and pretending to be one person every single day. If you're not used to fronting for long stretches of time at once, it's going to tire you out and test your endurance. And I've always thought one of the worst parts is that hosts are often left out of the loop of what's going on with the system internally. You may find alters have internally pulled away from you, or that you're not included in any decision-making that goes on inside. This is typically a safety measure; hosts have so much contact with the outside world and we can be seen as a security risk because of that, the system fears the host telling others our secrets/etc., but you can't talk about what you don't even know about, hence the exclusion of hosts from internal issues. It can be really hard to deal with that, it feels like your system turning their backs on you even though everyone has good intentions. Being host can be quite lonely and isolating.  


In general just know that it's not going to be easy, it's not going to be fun, and because of all this you need to communicate with your system and let them know when you're struggling or need help. It's good that there are two of you stepping up to do this, so you can give each other breaks when needed. When hosting gets really hard I try to remind myself that this is essentially a gift to the rest of my system. It's something I can do in order to spare less resilient alters who would fold under the pressure from having to do it, and in this way I am also protecting them. In the same way that some of them hold and experienced trauma that I myself am not burdened with, I am able to hold and experience the psychologically taxing responsibility of being out front almost 24/7. I hope this works out for the two of you, and that your original host gets much-needed rest and is able to return safely."

Didrama,fn27nzl,t3_fyo4d9,1586580149.0,"For every person who's outraged, posting responses, critiquing her self-diagnosis, etc. Trisha thrives. She revels in creating and maintaining drama, and it's so, so easy to stir up drama in a community filled with trauma survivors who have difficulty managing their emotions and functioning at the best of times. I've seen so many people describe her as a ""troll"" and her behavior as ""trolling."" But that label allows people, including Trisha herself, to think this isn't really that serious or destructive, that it's just online baiting that has no IRL consequences, or the outrage directed at her is merely ""cancel culture"" rearing its head again. I absolutely believe that we shouldn't allow people to push that narrative, because it ignores the fact that there are numerous systems in the real world who are being triggered and destabilized by this. It doesn't help that we've let the term ""triggered"" become a dumb unchecked meme, because real triggering is not funny, it's not someone getting overly upset by something minor, it's not a sensitive person overreacting. It is a terrible, involuntary trauma reaction that can be dangerous to a system's wellbeing. When real people are being intentionally harmed to this extent it's gone far beyond trolling, it's outright heartless cruelty.  


But ultimately neither I nor anyone else can KNOW she is faking. I don't like to make faking accusations at anyone, not even someone who's stooped as low as Trisha. But she is, *at best*, in a terribly dysfunctional system that needs treatment, not exposure. At worst she's a lying, malingering, intentionally harmful shit-stirrer resorting to exploitation of a trauma disorder for views. Either way she's continuously harming our community, fundamentally misunderstanding DID, and approaching all this in such a theatrical, histrionic way that makes it impossible to sympathize with her. The level of social damage she's inflicted on our community is almost on par with the damage done when Split was released, only this is worse because it can't be handwaved away as a work of fiction/art that relies on fantasy to sell its message, and she's made it personal by singling out DissociaDID and Anthony Padilla. She has singlehandedly made it even harder for people with DID to receive respect, support, and validation and made our condition look like attention-seeking nonsense. This is absolutely inexcusable and the bottom line, to me, is that it doesn't even matter whether she has DID or not anymore.  


It doesn't matter because regardless of whether she's a single- or multiple-identity person, she posted all of this knowing it would cause drama and harm, she timed the video to piggyback on the increase in public interest resulting from Anthony Padilla's video, she made a deliberate choice to call someone else out and then purposely engaged in back-and-forth poorly disguised smear campaigns. She shows she's ignorant about the facts of the condition and PROUD OF THAT IGNORANCE by talking about her self-diagnosis and spewing many myths/misconceptions about DID, making zero corrections and achieving no personal growth despite MANY people reaching out in attempt to educate her. Because it's not about accuracy, or trying for respectful expression, it's not even really about presenting her ""alters."" It's all about *attention* for her, it's all about views and notoriety and infamy. She's done shit like this before to the trans community, and she's literally famous for being a drama instigator. With that level of deliberate foolishness it stops mattering whether she has a system or not. Either way she should not be welcome within our community after what she's done, and she should not get to talk about this ever again without being called out. People should not allow her to just move on from this - she deserves to be haunted by this bullshit for the rest of her online ""career"" unless and until she educates herself, gets help and proves she understands what she's done (which will never happen because she is proud of the chaos she's caused, it's quite literally her job.)  


This entire situation is just exhausting and shitty. People with DID/OSDD don't deserve this kind of bullshit getting dumped on them. I'm so TIRED and FED UP of being dumped on. And the fact that the person doing the dumping claims to have DID makes it hurt worse, IMO. Betraying your own community this way is very disgusting. It's wrong, and I'm glad she's getting so much pushback even from non-multiples. I hope at the very least this has caused some more non-multiples to become allies.

Let him know that was okay, but in the future to let others in the system know what he's feeling so they can try to help. Show him he's safe among loved ones within the system now, and that if something scary or sad happens in the future he will have you all to protect him.

You cannot ""choose"" to have DID because it is traumagenic, and by definition no one consents to trauma or chooses to be traumatized. It's patently absurd to claim that people making up imaginary friends or LARPing different characters they've created is equivalent to DID. The brain is a complex thing capable of many things we don't yet understand, and if someone wants to think the character they've created is real, fine. But that has absolutely nothing to do with DID, and they should not co-opt DID terminology or associate their experience with DID at all. The association of people who claim to voluntarily create alters and all that has hurt the dissociative community's reputation (yet again) and we are associated with these ideas that don't belong outside the new age/spiritual/etc. communities. It's infuriating that people with DID cannot escape negative association with this shit when we talk about our condition.

The existence of multiple identities in a single body is only one aspect of DID, and it seems to be the only aspect these people are interested in, not the aspects that involve amnesia, flashbacks, severe dissociation and PTSD, dysfunction and distress, etc. All that horrible, negative shit is the real heart of the disorder. To claim you have a dissociative disorder when in reality you're imagining things is like constantly going around in a wheelchair despite having no medical or psychological need to be in that wheelchair. It's a blatant, callous, arrogant display of ignorance and a slap in the face for the people that struggle with this condition every minute of every day. Your friend getting frustrated with your amnesia is a perfect example of how all this harms actual systems - she is exasperated with a REAL symptom resulting from trauma, as a direct result of having her perception of dissociative disorders skewed by people who are ""choosing"" to be that way. I'm so sorry you're being treated this way, and I hope this friend educates themself. You deserve so much better than this."
AskDID,fmnb0hy,t3_fwawdj,1586222012.0,"Alters, like any other people, don't slide neatly into predetermined roles. Alter roles are not something set in stone, and ultimately they're just labels applied to situations/behaviors that we use as shorthand to communicate more easily. You are not missing anything - your system is set up in the way it needed to be FOR YOU to survive and carry on in your life. Don't focus so much on these roles, just get to know your alters as you would any other person IRL. Labels are supposed to be descriptors, not rigid jobs that alters must qualify to be counted in. The pressure to fit the definition of ""protector"" or ""gatekeeper"" can cause so much undue stress for alters, no one needs to confine or define themselves according to any label, they just need to be themselves. DID and people in general are too complex and malleable and rich with many traits to be slotted into boxes that way.  


I hope this helped at all. Having trouble getting my words out right now."
AskDID,fmna7lq,t3_fw7psm,1586221502.0,"In general this doesn't happen often because alters are there to protect the system and help everyone survive, which is in direct opposition to the scenario of someone fronting while driving with no idea how to operate a vehicle. That's a potentially dangerous or even fatal situation, most alters know what their abilities and strengths are and will avoid the front if they know they can't do a specific task that could result in serious harm. After all it's their safety and life on the line too. (Also per your last line, it's not necessarily the host that's driving by default.)  


Still, it does happen as everyone has already said. And like Church posted, a big part of driving  is tasks that become ingrained in muscle memory, so it's very unlikely an alter wouldn't at least be able to pull over or brake, etc. If all else fails, there can indeed be accidents - I've met a couple of people over the years who had this happen and it resulted in (mild) car accidents. Personally I'm terrified of driving and all this is one of many reasons why, I don't think we're ever going to get a license because it's far too overwhelming and scary to drive."
AskDID,fmn87zp,t3_fw8cbu,1586220277.0,"I vaguely acknowledge my ""birthday"" (January 9) which is the day I took over as host and started existing in my current role, I don't celebrate but I do think about my life back then. No one else really acknowledges birthdays, since the body's birthday is such a terrible time for us and we don't want more days of turmoil like that.  


Something we do when we want to focus positive things on a specific alter is to write them letters/notes telling them how much they're loved, what their role in our system has meant to us, what their strengths are, etc. Kind of like a birthday card, but in letter form instead and focusing on their contributions and accomplishments instead of just generic ""happy birthday."" Everyone who wants to participate writes their own letter, and it's been really good to see how the recipient reacts when they finally receive a little pile of letters sharing their pride and love and support for them. This might be kinda redundant if Ryan is coconscious and can already see what everyone is writing ahead of time. But even then he would be able to see the positive messages and he'd have the notes as physical reminders to read in cases of future distress or loneliness.  


Inner world party sounds fun too if it's possible.

I know it wasn't your intention to do so, but words like ""worst"" frame things in a competitive/ranked context which can't ever be objective or fully known, and more importantly is not helpful to our understanding of crime and may be hurtful to victims and survivors.  


To answer the underlying question itself, I'm sure there are crimes that will happen in the future which will seem more heinous than crimes we're familiar with now, but I'm also sure there were crimes in the past that would cause just as much shock/outrage but aren't widely known or known at all.

AskDID,fmgh5mt,t1_fmg92dp,1586048953.0,"It's good that you respect that their DID is personal to them, and they DO need to work on that personally with their own therapist, but IMO it stops being personal when alters engage in domestic violence or other forms of abuse. That is very much an *inter*personal situation. It's actions that directly involve and harm you, and it's absolutely within your rights to bring that up in your personal therapy sessions. You have been with them for 10 years - your relationship is inextricably intertwined with their issues at this point. Given that, it absolutely becomes your place to say things, and your therapist can't help you adequately if they aren't even aware of your entire life situation.  


It's overwhelmingly common for people with DID to be misdiagnosed, mistreated, invalidated, ignored, and struggle to find proper help for their condition. The average length of time it takes for people with DID to be properly diagnosed is 7 years, which equates to a staggering amount of rejection, invalidation, erasure, and other horribly negative feelings. In all the years I've engaged in the dissociative community I've only seen a handful of systems who were able to get qualified help in under a year. Because of this it's very common and so easy to fall into a mindset of ""we just can't be helped."" But that is one of the most counterproductive, psychologically toxic beliefs to cling to for someone with DID. Yes there are unfortunately very awful and unqualified therapists out there, but that doesn't mean you can't find someone who WILL help you if you keep searching. That hopeless mindset needs to be challenged; maybe if they spoke to other systems who have gone through this sort of shit too and eventually found help, they would feel less alone and more apt to believe there is hope for their system?  


I don't believe in ""bad alters"" either, but I do believe in unstable alters dealing with untreated issues who lash out at others and don't take responsibility for it. Every ""bad"" alter is merely engaging in behavior that, to them, is designed to keep the system going, no matter how destructive it may seem to outside observers. But if that crosses a line into abuse, they NEED to be called out and given help. Also, it doesn't matter if an abuser apologizes for what they've done if they make zero effort to change their mindset or behavior. ""Sorry"" doesn't erase the harm that was done, or resolve their internal issues that are causing them to act that way. The rest of their system is also dodging responsibility for this behavior. Every single thing an alter does when they front is ultimately the responsibility of the entire system, DID is NOT an excuse to be shitty and it's important alters understand that. If alters don't collectively take responsibility for abuse, they essentially become enablers of that abuser. The fact that this is coming from a person with DID doesn't change anything about the reality of the situation: that they are abusive and have taken no steps to correct or atone for that. An abusive alter doesn't need to be put ""in check"", they need to be treated for their unresolved issues and unprocessed trauma and taught productive coping skills in place of violence. If your partner truly doesn't have the ability to do this right now, it's time to seriously consider getting out of this relationship. You are not and cannot be responsible for managing their dysfunction.  


I know that isn't what you want to hear, and that even thinking about leaving someone you love so much, knowing you'd be leaving them alone with their internal issues, is an extremely hard choice to make, let alone actually carry out. But look at the personal cost. Look at the damage it's done to you, look at some of the things you're saying that are textbook statements victims in abusive relationships say to rationalize or dismiss their abuser's horrible actions. You are better than this, and you deserve better. Your question was whether or not they are able to live a normal, healthy life without therapy. I think that's been thoroughly answered, and I think deep down you knew the answer before you even posted. From everything you've posted, this comes off as a very dysfunctional and unhealthy system in an unhealthy relationship. If they were capable of living in a healthy way they would've done so long ago. It's up to you to decide what to do here, but just know you are free to post here again in search of support. I'm glad you're seeking professional help and are doing your homework on professionals in your area. You are incredibly strong to be able to deal with this situation for so long, and I hope so much that things will improve for you soon."

AskDID,fmg4gzk,t3_fuxzwu,1586041067.0,"I disagree it isn't your place to say this. Being their partner for 10 years you know them probably better than anyone else in their life, and even from the little you've described here it's clear they DON'T have this on lock. Choking and other abuse is never, ever, EVER okay no matter how infrequently it happens or whether the perpetrator has DID. Also, being with someone this long but not being comfortable sharing almost anything about your system with your partner is a recipe for disaster. It's a red flag for someone unwilling to confront and work through their own issues, and that is exactly the kind of person that is likely to create and engage in toxic behavior in a relationship, especially since there's been violence in the relationship in the past. So many systems would give *anything* to have a partner like you who is WILLING to support and understand DID and form bonds with alters. For them to resist that... I don't know how to phrase it nicely, other than that it's a red flag for dysfunction that you really aren't capable of sorting out on your own.

They need therapy. And so do you. This situation is not something anyone knows how to deal with alone, and especially since physical abuse has happened in the past I feel like a therapist's guidance could be crucial for you not just in terms of getting your relationship to a better place, but for you to better ensure your physical and psychological safety. And please be open to whatever advice that may come, even if it's taking a break from the relationship or leaving entirely. The MOST IMPORTANT thing here is your safety. It really sounds like you are not and have not put yourself first and focused on your own wellbeing enough for a long time. For a system to have an alter that has seriously harmed their partner more than once and for them to have been hospitalized for self-harm, to then refuse and resist professional help is absolutely irresponsible and dangerous for everyone involved. They need treatment for DID and trauma, and you both need help to figure out a way to involve their system in your relationship in a way that isn't abusive or dysfunctional. I can't emphasize enough that it matters SO MUCH how you've felt awkward, afraid, alone, and confused during these 10 years  with them. Because that isn't how a loving, healthy relationship is supposed to feel. They need to take responsibility for their behavior and dysfunction and learn to be better - and you need to acknowledge the way you've been neglected and hurt by your partner. Everyone else has left great advice and support already, and I hope it's helped put things in perspective for you to see all these comments urging you to see the harsh reality of this situation. No matter what happens, I wish you and your partner(s) all the best. I know this is an extremely difficult situation to be in and that it's hard to change the status quo in a longterm relationship, but it really sounds like your emotional needs are not being met, and the physical danger has created even more turmoil. Please know that it's okay to expect more from your partner and that feeling upset with their lack of initiative is valid. I'm so sorry you're going through this and you deserve so much more."

AskDID,flz1yzv,t3_frs8kb,1585613789.0,"I wish people would fucking educate themselves, and in turn educate others when they encounter ignorance. To put it more politely, I wish people understood trauma and its effects in general. Not just specifically DID-caliber trauma, but ALL trauma. I absolutely believe schools should teach young people about abuse and other trauma, what the signs are, how to respond, what to do and not to do. And equally importantly teach what it does to people, teach how to help them instead of judging or denying or denigrating survivors. There are almost no social outlets in which survivors can be open about their experience, and when people do come forward they are regularly silenced, invalidated, handwaved away or victim-blamed. Perhaps even worse, most people don't and *never will* realize how widespread trauma is, and how much harm it can create. People don't understand that trauma affects every aspect of a person's life for the duration of their life, and that even when someone gets the best treatment possible they will never be the person they were before their trauma. Growing up having experienced abuse, particularly if it's something like CSA/incest, makes every single other thing in life that much harder to deal with properly. It turns simply existing into a struggle. And not only do most people never get taught how to cope with that, but there are a staggering number of people that don't even understand they have PTSD, or a dissociative disorder, or any other trauma-related mental illness in the first place, because unless someone is a psychology student or gets lucky enough to stumble across the info themselves, they will never know the symptoms well enough to even cause them to seek treatment. Child abuse and childhood trauma is extremely common, yet we don't treat these issues as the *epidemic* it actually is, our cultures don't see or treat it as a priority. That INFURIATES me, even moreso because despite things like huge advances in our understanding of how trauma affects the brain and social movements like #metoo, very little real progress has been made that makes living as a survivor of trauma any easier.

I wish people understood that we didn't choose to be this way, that no matter how ""fake"" or over the top our symptoms look it's normal for us *in light of what we've been put through*. I wish people would do even 10 minutes of research about dissociative disorders before saying or writing cruel, ignorant, harmful messages of invalidation and intolerance. I wish people **cared** enough to respect others' humanity and experience, even if they don't even believe in DID. But all of that falls under the initial umbrella of education and awareness of trauma itself. Everything stems from that. And it's a goddamn shame that we as a species continue to allow ourselves to ignore the needs of the people who have been hurt most, because it's easier and less disturbing to not look at the truth and find solutions.

And that's a perfect example of why you need therapy, and what you need it for. You literally can't even see how other people exist and don't feel this way. The human brain isn't designed to function well if it's focused on horrific tragedies and corruption all the time. To worry to this degree - where you're at the point of thinking even your friends would instantly murder and rape at will if it became socially acceptable - is pathological, which you've already confirmed by saying you have OCD.  


I said more than once you didn't have to give up your beliefs or morals to get treatment, that it's about treating the obsession/anxiety, not forcing you to ignore injustice. And to be fair, you left some of my points unanswered as well. But that's understandable because we both left very long replies.  


If you have zero faith that a therapist could help you, you've automatically wiped out the option of having access to a huge amount of positive resources. It's so much more than just having a conversation. Therapists are literally trained to hear the kinds of things you're saying and break them down to get you to understand what's at the root of all this. For some people that means medication, some do CBT, some do both. And again, therapy isn't a straight-up problem solving thing. It's a process to provide you with adequate abilities to cope better with whatever is going on with you. I hope you will someday genuinely consider getting treatment from a professional. Nothing's ever going to get better for you if you aren't willing to change. I sincerely wish you nothing but the best though, regardless of what you choose. I have severe anxiety and I know it's a real bitch to suffer with, and you don't deserve to have to live that way either."

You're focused on the injustice of the world so much that you're losing sight of your own wellbeing."
stevenuniverse,flprao6,t1_flpnoh9,1585366638.0,">Anyway, first off, are you saying that people that can't afford therapy are just doomed? Surely there is another way.  


I said pretty much the opposite of that and don't know how you got that from my post, but yes, there are other ways. I'm in the U.S., and there are therapists who treat low/no income patients (although this is far from ideal treatment; I was only allowed to see my therapist for a certain number of sessions, and he could not refill my medication. I assume this varies by state and by country so you'll have to look into it locally if you're interested.)  


I'm truly sorry you've been turned away by doctors. I've had my share of shitty doctors as well and it is always painful and demoralizing. But every single thing you've spoken about here can be discussed and helped in therapy. Agreeing or disagreeing with your views is not what therapy would be about - it would focus on how you fixate on and obsess over those views to the point where it causes you distress. It is atypical and unhealthy to be experiencing that level of stress in reaction to those thoughts. You need help managing that stress and it's going to be extremely difficult to do that without professional help. You can learn to manage symptoms outside of therapy, but addressing the source of those symptoms is something a professional needs to handle.  


I don't particularly want to argue against your views because that won't accomplish anything, but I do want to ask why you think you know other peoples' internal moral code and life philosophy? How do you know that people in your life would be murderers and rapists given the right circumstances? Would YOU be that way under the same circumstances? If not, what makes you different from the people you do perceive as potentially evil?  


>As someone who watches Steven Universe, I would assume that you believe that people should be who they are. So what am I supposed to do if being who I am causes me intense stress just from being in this corrupt world?  


This is exactly part of the problem, that you seem to think this stress and discomfort just existing in this world is a part of your identity. When in reality extreme stress and the dysfunction it causes is not who you are, it's a negative mental health issue that can be treated. You don't have to deny your beliefs or morals, you just need to learn to process all this in a healthier way. Also - you've been talking about stress this whole time, but most of this sounds more like anxiety to me. Have you ever been evaluated for an anxiety disorder?"
stevenuniverse,flpmj4v,t3_fq99t5,1585363115.0,"(This comment was originally in response to another comment further upthread, but I after I finished I felt like it would make more sense as a reply to the OP instead.)  


Therapy *is* the ""answer,"" although calling it that gives a faulty impression of the purpose of therapy itself. Therapy doesn't exactly solve problems, it teaches *you* how to recognize what's causing your problems and how to react, adapt, or otherwise cope with them in a productive, positive, functional way. Therapy educates you about any mental illnesses you may have as well as any overwhelming/confusing/complex emotions you're experiencing. Therapists evaluate and guide the patient along their unique path to functioning and healing. It arms you with new positive coping skills, and you learn to identify negative coping mechanisms and redirect negative emotions and behaviors into something productive. The specifics of all that is obviously going to differ from patient to patient, there is no one solution that fits everyone.  


Like you, I spent a long time having no resources. I had no insurance for years, no therapist, no GP, no driver's license, no job, no experience, I couldn't even graduate college. I felt helpless and trapped, and I didn't care what happened to me because I truly believed I was a hopeless, horrible person. It took a huge wake up call in the form of being hospitalized and getting introduced to DBT that sparked a change in my way of thinking. I learned that I have to be my own advocate, I have to seek out solutions in the absence of outside help, and I have to WANT change in order for change to happen. There are tons of free resources online that explain various positive coping skills, and tons of forums/groups where you can receive support from others in similar situations to yours. For me part of my process is reading up on my condition(s) and educating myself about every facet of them, so I know what to expect and can plan how to deal with symptoms. Another hugely important part is that I go out of my way every single day to say something supportive and positive to myself, even if it's something really small. If you've spent years believing you are a hopeless case that can't progress, you have to spent just as much time and effort changing that way of thinking into positives. And I won't lie, self-improvement is extremely hard work and it takes dedication. There are many times I've given up on it, or just gotten complacent/lazy and stopped trying much. But what matters is that I eventually made the choice to KEEP TRYING, no matter what, even (especially!) when it feels utterly pointless. It's the trying that matters, even if it ends in failure, because every time you try you're retraining your brain to think about your life and yourself differently.  


You CAN change for the better, it's never too late or too difficult. The only reason anyone would be stuck literally unable to make progress is if they made a conscious choice to stop trying, cease all effort, and resign themselves completely. And even then people can revise their opinion and choose to try again. I see that you've dismissed a lot of the really good suggestions in other comments about ways to get treatment/help, and I don't understand why. How many of the self-improvement techniques that people have suggested here have you tried out? Do you know therapy can't help you from experience or are you just assuming, or basing it off a prior horrible experience? Have you considered seeing someone who specializes in stress management or whatever else you're specifically suffering with? Have you looked into consulting a life coach to address your struggle with motivation? You have SO many avenues available to you. You have options."
stevenuniverse,flpcsoc,t3_fq92iz,1585356496.0,"I have DID and I cannot adequately explain how much I've related to characters and storylines in this series. So many moments and themes reflect our experiences as a system and as trauma survivors. I got into Steven Universe rather late and I regret not watching it sooner, because it's truly helped me examine a lot of issues in my life that I was not dealing with properly.  


The fact that therapy was included in this finale is such an incredible and even groundbreaking thing. I can't recall ever seeing a cartoon aimed at a younger audience that showed therapy as the positive, empowering, healing tool it can be. Even if it isn't the first to do that, the show still emphasized the importance of good self-care and the consequences of not maintaining self-care in a way that was necessary and authentic. I know so many kids, teens, and adults alike have learned from this show great messages of self-love, having a support system, processing trauma, and learning to navigate around negative psychological obstacles as a result of mental illness and abuse. The series also broke ground in portraying many queer characters and relationships, something that if you had told me even 10 years ago would be happening in a mainstream cartoon on a *very* mainstream kids/teens channel I would have instantly dismissed as fake and impossible. It feels so good to finally see positive representation like this. Steven Universe was something special not just in terms of animation but in terms of culture as well, and I think it always will be seen as such.  


Thank you to every single person who worked hard on bringing this show to us. You can sense the love the cast and crew had for this series in pretty much every episode.

AskDID,flnpua6,t3_fpnp9k,1585323567.0,"In addition to the great answers that have already been given, it needs to be said that when you're the host your perception of both switching and amnesia can be very iffy or hard to identify. Especially when you're *very* early into the process of learning how all this works and don't yet have a baseline ""feel"" for how your system normally operates. I've known I have DID for over 15 years as host and there are still frequently times where I'll only realize a switch has happened way later, or somehow become made aware I have amnesia for something without realizing or feeling like I lost any time at all. Feeling like you're almost always present doesn't mean you aren't switching, it might just mean that staying close to the front *despite* switching is how you function as host (it's the same for us, and for plenty of other hosts/systems.) There are also other types and degrees of amnesia besides total blackouts, and you can have amnesia for your amnesia.  


No one knows exactly what is going on or why it's happening that way when they first begin to accept this, and your understanding of those things is going to change a lot over the coming months anyway.

I feel like the answer to your question is... it's both. If you have sex with other alters, you're engaging with them physically and psychologically, your sexual relationship is being experienced by more than one person. But like you said, they share a body, so you're still only engaging with one physical person. This strays into the ""how do you define 'a person'?"" territory which is always a murky topic.  


My personal views on this are similarly complicated. We haven't collectively had many sexual experiences overall, and I (the host) have had even fewer, since I'm asexual and sex is totally unimportant to me in a relationship. But when my ex-GF and I did get sexual another alter would sometimes front completely, or more often co-front with me during the experience. For this reason I consider those experiences to be both mine... and not mine. It's hard to explain. I consider the experiences I was present for to have happened to me, personally. In other words, I integrate them into my life story and self-concept and can honestly say ""this happened to me."" The experiences which only that other alter was present for I don't consider to have happened to me personally - I don't relate to the memories or think of them as mine/happening to me. But because it happened to our body, it's part of our collective experience. I integrate that into the overarching life story of our entire system, but not my personal life story. Does any of this make sense? I feel like this is coming off as a complete mess but I swear I do have a coherent point somewhere in here. :I"

It sounds like this approach has had a significant negative impact on your partner's system and wellbeing. If this therapist has done more harm than good and they won't change their approach, it's time to get out. No one should have to suffer through therapy that doesn't feel right or helpful for them."
AskDID,flcf4n3,t3_fnye82,1585028575.0,"I also have a hard time letting go of the front even when I want to, it's the same for a lot of hosts and I've found that for most of them it's a control/trust issue. Often hosts are so overwhelmed and stressed from dealing with everyday life that we cling to our role because it's the one thing we can feel in control of, it's familiar and safe compared to letting others have free reign over the front. If you're like me you prefer to know what's going on with other alters as much as possible at all times, and the fear that stepping back from hosting might leave you out of the loop is very real. Ask yourself: what am I afraid of about stepping down? Do I trust other alters to behave responsibly in my stead, and if I don't, why not? What internal fears and anxieties am I holding onto that make me reluctant to let go of my role for a while?  


Discuss with your alters if anyone is willing and able to temporarily take over hosting duties fulltime, or if that's too much then to share the role with you so you can get some rest while the other person is fronting. Let them know you're struggling and need their help. It really does take practice to learn to fully let go, and it's important to know that you CAN do it even if it seems impossible right now. In the meantime as you find yourself unable to leave the front, try to set aside some time each day where you disengage from the world and its stressors, and instead concentrate 100% on self-care. Taking even one hour each day for yourself can make such a huge difference. Engage in relaxing hobbies and self-soothing techniques, try relaxation or meditation exercises if you're into that sort of thing. You can even use that time to practice visualizing letting go of the front. (sorry ending here because I dissociated a lot and don't remember what else I was going to say...)"

Typically the only alters who can break through that block are protectors if they get specifically triggered forward, or the block can be undone by the alter that has control over switching (not sure who that is, they stay hidden in the very back of our headspace.)

If he's uncomfortable with other alters that's his hangup and it needs to be challenged/corrected or it's almost surely going to lead to everyone getting hurt emotionally. A relationship built on a cracked, unstable foundation of trust issues and his lack of connection with the rest of your system is doomed to eventual failure or heartbreak. He needs to at least make an effort to get to know the others, even if it makes him uncomfortable or it feels silly to him. His feeling guilty is not productive or conducive to change - he needs to push himself to step outside his comfort zone and TRY. Relationships are about compromise, and he needs to step up here and do better. Not only because he's absolutely capable of it if he actually tries, but because *you deserve* better. Getting a therapist involved might be something that would help you both navigate this confusing situation.
