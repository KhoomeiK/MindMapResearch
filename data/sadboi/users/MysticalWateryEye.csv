Also, she has admitted time and time again that her medication dulls her libido, due to the fact that she hasn't had sex in awhile, i feel she was hoping an in person interaction would bring that ""spark"" back, and it didn't, and as someone who has a chronic illness as well, and with libido issues it is depressing as fuck when you think ""ah yes! now maybe i can try again"" but nothing works and you feel broken. it sucks, and i seriously wish tlc would have focused more on the chronically ill relationship struggles instead of pushing the very fraudy ""i've gotta come out"" fraudyline.

She's not geoffrey, she's not Ed, those families won't be upset to see that an emotional person made a documentary. In the grand scheme of things she will go away after this, the documentary will bring awareness and that will be about it, maybe here and there a random youtuber will make a story about it.

In another, write down if you had a bad GI upset that day. 

Do you have an epipen? i know our paranoid minds feel more relieved when we have one.

Now that you may have safe foods, slowly spread out from the safe food, like ""i can eat this cheese with this bread"", now add ""this cheese with this protein and bread"". or whatever. just add an extra item. 

Worse case scenario, because you need the weight to do the full panel of allergy tests, is nutritional drinks, or a tube. I hate to put it that way, but it really might be your only option to return to a safe weight to do tests. 

Obviously, i'm not a doctor, just someone who has an anxiety brain that overthinks tons of things, and family members with a similar issue. It's rough what you are going through, especially because you've been actively trying to do something about it, but keep getting stuck. 

I'm sorry if i missed something in there, but have they ruled out gastroparasis?


The hunger cues will return, some people it's instant, others it takes time. All bodies are different.  But for now the mechanical eating will work until you get the hang of it.
