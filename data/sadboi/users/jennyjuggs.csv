When not on my meds I have hallucinations when I’m half asleep, can’t really identify what’s real. I have sleep paralysis and fall asleep at random parts of the day. I’ve been discouraged when it comes to finding another doctor. So I’ll just sit here knowing something is wrong with me and no one to help."
