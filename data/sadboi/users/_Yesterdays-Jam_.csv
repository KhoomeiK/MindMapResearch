Saying that, it really really was destroying me until a month or so ago. Then I sat down and told him I wanted to explain it.

I am not an atheist because I have decided not to believe in anything, I am atheist because I see no evidence to support the existence of a god, and as a result I feel their existence is unlikely.

>Shouldn’t we be constantly questioning the universe? letting ourselves be open?

Yes. Absolutely. I'm open to any evidence. Science relies upon constantly asking questions and re-evaluation based on the emerging evidence. 


>God could exist in so many ways, god could be the manifestation of the universe, the collective consciousness of humans, or maybe mushrooms are god and we aren’t able to understand their level of consciousness. There are so many different levels and spaces it could exist on.


Yes, god *could* exist in these ways. It is highly unlikely based on the lack of evidence, but if I see any solid evidence to support these theories then I'd gladly change my mind. 


>The religious are “delusional” and the atheists are “edgy”.

I disagree with both statements. For the most part, religious people are not (in my view) delusional. They have different life experiences, values and views on what constitutes evidence for themselves personally. They aren't delusional, just different in a few minor ways. Same goes for atheists. Not trying to be edgy, just different in minor ways, leading to a difference in opinion."

It is hard enough when you can barely look after yourself, let alone trying to do an actually good job of providing a pleasant environment for a Child.

I constantly feel like I'm not good enough for any of them, that they don't love me and I've trapped them, but I've come to terms with the fact that there is literally nother they could do to convince me otherwise.

I love them both so much, they're lovely, I try my hardest with them and they're becoming amazing and caring people, however I find it incredibly hard. I feel such an enormous guilt on their behalfs because I feel like I do a horrendous job. Parenthood is hard for anyone, but this makes it especially hard. And trying to care for someone so vulnerable when you feel barely able to care for yourself feels almost close to impossible. But you don't have the choice in giving up, because you brought them into the world and it is your duty to carry on and some how manage, and built an environment for them to flourish. 

If it is something you actually really desire to do then my advice is plan very carefully before hand. make sure that you have a strong plan to deal with the stress, parenting challenges, money problems.

AvPD,fjg9cxn,t3_fcta3w,1583317859.0,"Me. I'm not diagnosed. I've been diagnosed as GAD but I know it doesn't explain my symptoms. I'm pushing and pushing for more exploration but it feels like the adult MH team don't care / are too busy (I'm under the most inadequate mental health trust in the country, how is that for luck?!). I'm at least having 'CBT' with the psychiatrist so a chance to reiterate my symptoms and stuff but I feel like they don't care.   I shouldn't complain because so many people here don't get any help or slip through the net. I feel like no-one believes me and tbh I don't blame them. I don't trust myself 99% of the time either."

The idea of my SO or someone else doing this for me makes be feel really uncomfortable, a bit scared, a bit sick. 

I think maybe because of my experiences, I expect people to not be interested in me, and also have a massive issue with control. When people are interested, I look for the malice or alterior motive.

I also have major issues with self esteem, and 'helping' often feels patronising, or like I'm someone's 'case' to be 'fixed'. 

Bleh. My issues though, what you're doing is very thoughtful and proactive. I'm not in a good place right now, so especially sensitive I think."

I've always been explicitly clear about being atheist and never have taken up offers to come to the Kingdom Hall etc. I wouldn't consider them proper friends as I only see them when we bible study, however, we usually chat for sometimes many hours about life and non-god stuff. They have had me over to their house many times, our kids play together, so it certainly doesn't feel formal either. 

The more I read, the more I think that this might be unusual. I mean, we were studying a chapter about demons and I was teaching them about Black Sabbath 😅"

But I am 29 (almost) and I know it's pathetic to most people but I still suck my thumb. Not in public anymore because it's shameful. 

When I was 17ish I just didn't give a shit and must have been sucking my thumb out in the wild when A friend's uncle was like 'lol, were you molested as a child?'. 

I didn't think about it much at the time, but although I wasn't molested, I do wonder if there is something in that comment. Maybe it is trauma  linked."
JehovahsWitnesses,ffbtcgb,t1_ff877qp,1579782010.0,"VERY interesting. I am an atheist. I've been studying the bible with JWs for a few years as it interests me (in an academic kind of way, I've tried to be transparent about this and it doesn't seem to have bothered them). 

I came here to listen to another side of the story, and it's shit like this that they don't tell you. I was explicitly told that they had predicted the events of 1914, and knew it would be the start of the end. 

Hearing what you have said makes it feel like what I have been told has really misrepresented the history of what they were saying."
CPTSD,ffbktaa,t3_esnfmg,1579770125.0,"My partner had a really authoritarian upbringing. It's definitely affected him and his sister is really unwell. I have to remind him that it is normal for our children to test boundaries. That the aim of our parenting isn't to try to stop it occurring all together. We aren't failures because they dare to express their feelings in the only way they know how. It's our job to teach them better coping strategies, empathy and love. When they're being assholes they aren't trying to hurt us, they are feeling so much, are asking for our guidance and feel comfortable enough to be open with us. It might be hard, but really it's also a gift in a way."
CPTSD,ff98i2m,t3_es6c2h,1579707291.0,"This happened to me too. I luckily never made the step to physically meet anyone, but I really nearly did. I hadn't even realised what it WAS until really really recently. 

It scares me because I was intelligent. I was internet smart. I should have 'known', but as a child you don't realise that you're being taken advantage of, or manipulated. I sought it out myself ffs. 

I have children of my own now, and at this point (as well as obviously educating them) I feel like the biggest preventative will be trying my hardest to make sure they feel loved and secure."

I've always wondered if it is something I put out, or something I seek. 

It's not necessarily a negative - these people understand me, and I understand them better."
