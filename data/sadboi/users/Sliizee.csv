depression,ezki25s,t1_ezgp5w5,1567960621.0,"I know self-harm won't solve any of my issues, and i am currently seeking help for the 3rd time.

I speak to psychologists and take medication, and have been doing so for the past 3 years or so, but i don't feel like anything is helping. So...i self-harm to relive some of the mental stress and frustrations.

My family isn't religious, so i guess i don't have to worry about that at least...though i believe my mother would be the one who might lash out.

My father on the other hand, knows less about how much i'm struggling, so it might come as a shock for him...but i feel like he would be more understanding and caring, so...i suppose i just need to man-up and talk to him. 

Anyway, thanks!"
