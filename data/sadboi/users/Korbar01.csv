boating,fcunxc5,t3_ej0p77,1577985011.0,Check the floor and transom throughly!
boating,f8s6mn9,t3_e1sybn,1574771344.0,"Assume you need to spend $1000 to get it in the shape you want - you’ll probably need to clean it, do some minor repairs, fluid flushes, etc.

If the transom is solid and the floors are solid then get it!"
Anxiety,f5qklek,t3_dothnj,1572378611.0,"I can't recommend this - it's only a short term fix. I know it's hard, but try seeing a therapist to work on techniques to work to lessen the frequency of the panic attacks."
boating,f2x0838,t1_f2wyj1u,1570472252.0,"I'll definitely look at that. 

The previous owner had somehow crimped the 2 (blue/green) wires together individually and then covered it with about 10 feet of electrical tape, so of course it was all wet and disgusting. Also, I can see huge globs of silicon at the base of the trim motor, which leads me to believe water got into the trim motor at some point, probably destroying it."
boating,f2wvug1,t1_f2wvf3w,1570470813.0,"The blue wire is missing some of its sheath at the top of the trim motor. Also there are wire crimps connecting the green and blue wires to another set of green and blue wires about halfway to where the wires go into the outboard. 

I’m not sure how to fix this."
boating,f2os2z4,t1_f2ol9s1,1570332587.0,Never seen that! I have a 1999 Javelin that has some sealant around the transom motor mount holes. Maybe unscrew the bolts a little and put some sealant on them?
boating,f1c0sae,t1_f1bv4mo,1569347314.0,It actually doesn't have a tank vent haha!
boating,f1agyxt,t1_f1abjl5,1569293735.0,This was taken by my wife at Canyon Lake in Texas. I’m on our 1999 Javelin Venom 17.
boating,f0zbijo,t3_d6ylj1,1569091230.0,"I figured it out! The tilt tube nut was too loose. I tightened it a lot more after greasing it up. Now the issue is resolved!

Thanks everyone!"
boating,f0wbzf1,t1_f0wbpia,1569003870.0,What’s the best way of doing this? Taking off the trim fluid cap and lowering/raising the motor multiple times until it runs out?
boating,f0w9vqa,t3_d6ylj1,1569002404.0,"I bought this boat last week of off a guy who let it run with low fluid and a broken trim fluid reservoir cap that he tried sealing with some rubber silicon. I'm betting some water got into the hydraulic lines at some point or another. 

Motor raises up without issue. When it's lowered it's very jerky and bounces the whole boat. The trim fluid reservoir cap was not fitting properly, so I bought a replacement that fits perfectly. I filled up the reservoir with power trim fluid and have raised/lowered the motor over a dozen times, but I haven't lowered the motor completely onto the rams as it will bottom out on my driveway. I've also tightened the trim nut near the transom.  


I'm not sure what else to check. Is there still air in the lines causing this issue? Do I need to keep filling, triming, filling, etc until it stops? Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
boating,f0kvua3,t3_d55rlp,1568689481.0,I’m going to Canyon this Saturday! How’s the fishing been?
boating,f0fc864,t1_f0fbzmf,1568581130.0,Will those work for the main drain plug? Those looks like baitwell plugs.
boating,f0f8h3e,t3_d4q2jt,1568579541.0,"I bought a 1999 Javelin with a plastic drain plug the owner provided. I want a backup plug but standard 1 inch brass plugs don’t fit. Looks like the previous owner put in a plastic housing that came with this type of plug.

Anyone know where I can get a replacement plug? I’ve tried Googling but can’t find it."
Anxiety,ez5cw9r,t3_bjxw1t,1567698152.0,"I know this is older, but I have that same kinda feeling and ""slight"" dizziness that is very difficult to describe. I also feel like my eyes are ""lagging"" in a sense when objects move.

&#x200B;

I notice that those feelings are greatly diminished when I go do something enjoyable, so i'm not sure it's something to be worried about, but i'm getting it checked out just to be sure."
Anxiety,ez5brd1,t3_czqtqt,1567697799.0,"Yes, very common. I had this for over a year before it finally moved onto something else (dizziness and feeling of falling)."
Anxiety,eywk6uk,t1_eywjpwr,1567531374.0,A few months. It comes and goes. I notice it a lot when I’m standing in front of a computer screen as I have a standing desk at work.
Anxiety,eyw36pg,t3_cxynob,1567519707.0,"I’ve felt the same way for a few months now. It comes and goes randomly, definitely increases with stress. 

I noticed over the weekend while I was relaxing that it seemed greatly diminished, but as soon as I got to work this morning it came right back."
sanantonio,eyhwj5d,t3_cwmhbx,1567093798.0,LOL most legal immigrants HATE illegal immigrants. Get this propaganda piece outta here.
Anxiety,eyfhpar,t3_cwv4zv,1567048970.0,"Get off doctor Google. That makes everything worse.

I have health anxiety too. Here’s my rule of thumb: If I notice a weird symptom I make a note of it and keep an eye on it for a couple weeks. If a week or two has gone by and nothing improved, I go to the doctor.

I know it’s hard, but you have to convince yourself you’re fine. I will talk to myself out loud and reassure myself.

Seeking reassurance from others is only going to make things worse in the long run."
Anxiety,eyfh1vi,t3_cwukhj,1567048684.0,See a doctor. You need to be treated for this.
Anxiety,eyfguwe,t3_cwsdyv,1567048600.0,"Do relaxed breathing techniques. It takes practice but try to have patience.

Try singing a song you enjoy when the symptoms flare up to calm yourself. 

See a therapist to get more help."
Anxiety,eyfcr0n,t1_ey3e5yg,1567046813.0,How do you deal with it? This seems to come and go randomly. Sometimes it will last for days and it will vary in severity.
Anxiety,ey87qh1,t3_cw002u,1566913520.0,"I had this for months back in 2016. I recommend just trying to focus your attention on something else. 

&#x200B;

Have you tried CBT? You should find a therapist that can help with this."
Anxiety,ey3fpmo,t1_ey3anmp,1566763261.0,"My anxiety “feelings” always move onto something else. For a while I had this awful feeling in my stomach, like when you don’t eat for hours type hunger pain. Eventually it went on to something else.

I’m hoping this is the same because it’s very annoying when you want to play with your son or do anything really."
