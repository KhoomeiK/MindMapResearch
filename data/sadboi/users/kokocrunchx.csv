As much as you love someone, it’s not worth thinking of many steps and planned out methods to get him back. And maybe he can use this time to focus on his depression and try to get better"

AskReddit,f2lgknq,t3_ddh8vm,1570294733.0,"I remember watching a movie back when I was a kid and I can’t seem to find this movie ANYWHERE. But basically it was about this girl and her sisters (can’t rmb if she had brothers), they went out to the farm side where her grandparents lived and they were meant to stay there for the summer. Once they arrived, she and her sisters went inside the barn beside their grandparent’s house and they noticed a tyre swig.  Everything was fine, but once she got onto it, I think they swung her too hard and the rope connecting to the swing snapped and she fell and injured herself really badly. 

After that incident, she couldn’t move at all. She was stuck in her room (which was on the second floor of the house). Her sisters used to come and take care of her, brush her hair and give her company. She used to also get physical therapy in her room and I also recall she used to have classes in her room too. But she would look out her window and just envy her siblings being out. 

Then long story short, it was either Christmas or her grandads bday (I cant rly rmb but it was a special event). The family never expected her to come down to the first floor to celebrate but she surprises them by walking all the way down. And that’s how the movie ends. 

There’s no way I’m making this up but I have no idea how to find the name of this movie online 🙃"
