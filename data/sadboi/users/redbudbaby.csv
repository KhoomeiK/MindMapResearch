depression,fn7357w,t1_fn7188o,1586712379.0,"Thank you so much for your thoughtful and insightful replies. I’ve been texting him constantly. (Worries it’s too often). But he doesn’t feel like talking (understandably), and I can’t just sit next to him quietly as we live in different states. He’s my sweet baby brother and all I want to do is protect him. I’m so consumed by thoughts of wanting to help him get better sometimes I can’t sleep."
depression,fn6y7qi,t1_fn6xkxn,1586709665.0,Thank you! I want to share this with my brother but I don’t want to overwhelm him or attack him with “self-help” advice. Not sure how much he even understands right now about reality. He denies he’s depressed. He also has schizophrenia. He’s not very aware of anything. But was recently diagnosed with deep depression.
depression,fn6wap1,t1_fmsohpz,1586708601.0,Any tips or words of advice on how you turned your life around?
depression,fn6ud2x,t3_fzz2ex,1586707526.0,Anyone?
depression,fmfh0u3,t3_futnmu,1586027066.0,"It is NOT too late to find happiness. It’s NEVER too late. Please hang in there. The most important thing is to find love for yourself before you can give love to anyone else. Nurture yourself and good things will follow. 

Honestly — what do you enjoy doing? Anything you are passionate about or talented at? Focus on anything that can build your confidence. 

The best therapy for me has been yoga. It’s given me an opportunity to find self love, acceptance and peace. And focusing on one moment at a time can reduce anxiety and stress or feelings of hopelessness. 

I am so sorry you’ve had such a struggle. I’m sure there are people who love you and friendships in your future but for now you need to become your own friend.

💕❤️"
