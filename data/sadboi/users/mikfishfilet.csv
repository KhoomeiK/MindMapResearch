I told him I didnt like him like that. That I wasnt interested and he basically chalked it up to him being too fucked up. Like okay thanks. Didnt know being drunk was an excuse to keep making moves on someone who said no.

Secondly, I think it's normal that you guys were consoling each other because your families had been very close for ages. So as friends, of course you're going to be there for each other..

Some would say its destiny. I mean I would hope you guys didnt have feelings for each other while your spouses were alive, but you only get one life.
