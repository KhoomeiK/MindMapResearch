But at least there *is* food, just need to be a little creative sometimes. Ive been getting way less fresh things, canned or frozen to keep longger. Paper goods are another story. My bf drops me at work for 6:45am and gets to the store by 7am just to get toilet paper/tissues/paper towels. Hes been doing this one morning every week or two depending on what he can get.

I was told I would be immediately protected doing it this way, and am still on a 3 month cycle with one break with the patch as well. I just feel more protected, having a higher dose form makes me feel better about it. To be honest I have sex once or twice a day, so ensuring I'm protected is EXTREMELY important. I dont think I'm going to end up having kids at all. I have the most luck sticking them on my arm, towards the front where it gets squishy (if you were to hold your palm straight up). Literally no side effects aside from cold sweats day 1 (and I can't even fully say if that was the bc or not) and fleeting nausea for maybe 2 days.
