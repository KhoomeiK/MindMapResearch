Anxiety,fmilg5w,t3_fvi08v,1586111936.0,"Personally I like to just stop, take in my surroundings and focus on deep slow breaths with my shoulders held back.

Heart was racing while out a walk other day having a panic attack over thought of going to work. Took a moment to look at the hills and fields really helped to ground myself."
Anxiety,fmikrg8,t3_fvcv2t,1586111541.0,"Have 3 days in work, not sure how many days I will get the week after. Went a big walk today with my GF which was amazing, before we decided to keep our distance for now to keep our families safe during Covid lockdown.

Currently feeling guilty about sitting not really doing anything except reading educational articles and youtube videos that I enjoy. 

I am grateful I still have some money coming in after seeing recent unemployment figures, but it can change at anytime for me as a temporary worker.

Got a plan lined up once things are back to normal working with my GFs dad and eventually starting a business which is the main thing getting me through the days.

Time for a fresh start and to work on what I am passionate about and not having others control when and how long I work. 

Stay safe and positive people Its hard but reading about others situations really helps and makes me feel less alone."

Anxiety,fm7znch,t1_fm7z32a,1585839979.0,"I was lucky I met my gf in high school when I was in a better place, we didnt end up together for a few years after school. We look back and wonder what if I hadnt asked her to go out a drive that night, we were both out of work and had no money and we have come such a long journey together. I appreciate her more and more so my advice is if you want it go and get it youll know the right person for you. I knew all those years back when me and my gf were just friends"
