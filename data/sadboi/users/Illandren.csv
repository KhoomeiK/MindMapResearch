As you said, it could be wasted development. However, just because there are more factions doesn't mean that there will be war between all of them.

WoW probably is not the game to implement this system since we're already ""too deep""

An alternative is to break up the factions or give guilds some individuality. I think it would be interesting to have guilds choose what other guilds they form alliances with even if it's a guild of humans, dwarfs, and night elves allying with a guild of orc, trolls, and taurens. All while being at war with a guild that is solely gnomes.
