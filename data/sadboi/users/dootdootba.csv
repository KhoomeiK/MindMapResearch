I don't know how else to put it, but sometimes it doesn't matter what I'm doing or how loud my music is, I can't stop it from playing over and over.... It's like being trapped in a sick nightmare. A few beats of a song will send me into a flashback. I get emptional flashbacks constantly, where all of the feelings from then flood me, and it's debilitating, and I want to run. Or die. 

I get a lot of panic attacks... well, usually, I can stop them before they're full-blown, but I'm always tense and get panicky at the drop of a hat. I don't feel safe around guys I don't know when I'm walking down the street. 

My nightmares come in waves and are the general topic of what I went through but different. When I'm awake, half the time I'm a dead girl walking. I go through my day, but I can't shake it. I'm always depressed... I never feel like I can truly live. Every time I start to think that maybe THIS time, I'm truly healing and start to adjust and relax, it comes back. So now I'm terrified of having a good day, because the other shoe always drops when I do... I had a good number of weeks before lockdown, and I thought that I had healed... I was so wrong. 

Stupid things remind me of my trauma. I almost can't remember what it's like to watch T.V shows without breaking down. It would be nice to feel normal... or see an orange hoodie without freaking out. 

I'm not really sure how much I dissociate. I had about four months straight of dissociation, but since then it happens sometimes. Sometimes it's nice. Like when I'm in so much pain that my body just shuts off, and my brain shuts down, and I can't feel anything. I'm basically either numb or in tons of pain with no middle ground. 

My symptoms have morphed over the four years that I've been trapped in this hell... for example, I used to shake uncontrollably when I was triggered to the point where I couldn't walk. I haven't had that happen in a long time, thank God. 

The only people I would wish this hell on are the ones who inflicted this on people with ptsd so they could see what their hell looks like. 

Ptsd is like drowning: you're not dead, but you aren't alive either.
