Okay so here’s what you must do: 

Go into firing range, get a havoc, no attachments, and either r301 no attachments(maybe you can put a magazine on the r301)or another gun you need help with, and what you do is go to one of those big square targets, and make sure you empty the clip without missing, see what the max damage is on the havoc, 

Now what you do is go onto one of the platforms that has guns and other items, and try to stand still, aim down, and shoot the moving targets(the big square ones) and keep shooting it until you get the max amount of damage atleast 3 times in a row, you can keep going if you want, and now do the same with the r301, look at max damage with no attachments except a purple magazine, and then go to the same exact spot and do the same thing but try to get max damage 4 or 5 times

keep doing this every day before playing, so when you get on go to firing range, keep doing this for about 10 min or so unless you don’t have enough time but i recommend always doing this, and switching it up. 

Sooner or later, maybe even less than a week, you should be incredibly good with this gun, but the thing is responding to actual fights, if you can get a friend to play with you:

Have them switch to friendly fire ON, and just walk around, tell them to randomly attack you and surprise you by busting your blue shield, and keep doing this, and when you can respond by taking down atleast a legendary shield, then you should be pretty good, maybe try to kill them completely which is nearly impossible, but if you can do that then you won’t need any more training. 

What you should do now is have 2 friends with white shields and nothing else, and same with you, and try to beat them in a 2v1 fist fight.  

This helps for me but usually i do 1v1 but 2v1 is much better, it’s just they might hit each other by accident, and this helps me bcuz i know when you run, when to attack. 

 What legend do you main? if you main octane always remember to stim and dodge bullets, this is great for the havoc imo bcuz you can just spray your targets down and they won’t even be able to it you really if you know how to use stim correctly."
