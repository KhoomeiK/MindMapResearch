Maybe temperature checks at airports).

I don't know what SIF is so no idea, as Universal have already suggested make all retail and food locations contact-free with all restaraunts operating on a takeout basis entirely, any shows should have alternate row seating with staff on hand to ensure that social distancing is followed if some form of obstacle is not available to block every other seat, while also enforcing that fabric masks are to be worn at all times except when eating and drinking. 

As for lines, Universal already uses virtual line systems which seems the most logical option to use until social distancing guidelines aren't necessary. I'd also expect that they would emphasise the express pass which would work as more of a front of line pass which you would buy for a specific house at a specific time, similar to Disney's Fast Pass+ just at a commensurate fee. 

Close quarters is a difficult one, firstly all Scare Actors would through some use of themeing have mouth coverings, house would operate in much the same way but by allowing only a specific number of individuals in which would be based upon the social distancing we are all familiar with, if these guidelines were put into place I fail to see why spray water or air compressors wouldn't be usable although these would obviously angled in such a way that the water is aimed away from the face."
