Also, as mentioned below by another user, anyone in the UK over the age of 5 can now be tested if they experience any symptoms of coronavirus. 

All in all, Sky news is looking quite positive today! Talking about how Italy have had a wonderful day with the reopening of cafes and hairdressers, Spain are likely to open their doors to tourists from the end of June, and it is going to be the hottest day of the year in the UK soon! Keep positive guys."

I dream vividly every single night, sometimes multiple dreams every night and I’m one of those people that can remember every dream I’ve had and recall them years later. Also, as it is 2am now as I’m writing this, it takes me hours usually to fall asleep. 

A few years ago I went camping with my brother and it was around midnight/1am and we were lying in our separate sleeping bags talking about whatever and after a while we said goodnight. I turned around in my sleeping bag, literally blinked, and it was the morning, 7.30am. I said straight away what the hell just happened. I had just closed my eyes, that second, and now I was awake and it was morning immediately. I even felt groggy and tired, not refreshed at all and I was so annoyed that I now had to spend the day with no sleep.

The next year, my mum and dad divorce and my dad moves to a town 45 minutes away from me, that I’d never been to, and as we are driving I see the exact cottage from my dream.

When I got to his house, he text me to say the key was under the mat outside the door and when I looked under the mat, the key was there along with a post it note saying “welcome”. 

Then there were post it notes on the stairs, leading all the way to his room. When I got to his room, there was a glass of water next to the bed saying “if you get thirsty”, the laptop was open and ready on Netflix so I had something to watch, and on the mirror on his wall was a post it note saying “you look pretty”. 5 years later and that last post it note makes me smile uncontrollably no matter where I am.

Mid Feb, I had a cold. I had a very sore throat, felt congested In my head and felt like I couldn’t hear anything. I was quite hot and sweaty and had a runny nose, but I didn’t have a cough. I had it for about a week and then I felt better. Me and my fiancé went to Florence on the 29th feb, after I had recovered and had a nice holiday. 

The day we got back, 3rd March, my boyfriend developed flu like symptoms. He had every single symptom of the coronavirus. He had a high temperature, sudden and continuous cough, extremely tired, sweating and had the chills, lost his appetite and this lasted for about 4 days, but the cough lasted almost 2 weeks. We both got tested for coronavirus on the 6th March and the results came back negative. However she did say on the phone to stay in isolation until our symptoms had cleared “incase it is a false negative”. 

So it’s a few weeks later, we both feel ok. But I’m wondering, could he have had coronavirus even though the test was negative? How common are false negatives? 

I wish he did have it so I know now he has recovered well and is fine, because my anxiety is all about the thought of losing him. 

Again, I apologise because I don’t really know what I’m looking for. I know you can’t guarantee he had it or didn’t have it, but I just needed to tell someone my thoughts."

I have crippling anxiety, especially when it comes to health issues. I’ve lost countless people to unexpected health issues, and it has destroyed me in unusual ways. 2 weeks ago today, in Florence, I got engaged to my best friend of 5 years. That night, he came down with a flu and I was PETRIFIED. I haven’t had a full blown panic attack in 4 years until that night, and every night since, I’ve had at least 1 per day. We came home and we were tested for coronavirus and luckily we were tested negative. I am still nervous because we have to go to work still and there are chances we could still catch coronavirus, and the main thing I worry about is losing him. However, yesterday I realised that I’m worrying about something that might never happen, and I’m worrying to the extent where I am in a separate room shaking on the floor in tears over losing him, when he is in the other room watching a movie on the couch with a quilt. Why am I not in there with him??? What was I doing!? I know it’s not possible to just simply turn off anxiety, but in that moment I thought all I can do is spend time with him now. If we do get poorly, I’m putting myself through the trauma twice. I may as well spend time with him. So I put my phone down, I cuddled on the couch and today is my first day in 2 weeks panic attack free. I don’t know if this will help anyone, but take a deep breath and spend your time with the things or people you love."
