But kinda leaning more to NTA. Everyone has different needs for sleeping, and living with someone forces you to compromise. I propose you buy some comfortable ear plugs, and he buys some headphones he could fall asleep with, and both of you do that. Unless for one of you wearing the thing in your ear just isn't possible to adjust to, then y'all will have to figure out something else. It isn't fair for either of you to have to sacrifice sleep for the other. 

I personally think it's a teensy bit more a-holey of him to not let you turn the TV off once he's deep into snooze-land, but perhaps you need to wait a little bit longer for him to get into that real good deep sleep where turning the TV off won't disturb him. 

Also, ear buds are way more uncomfortable than ear plugs in my humble opinion, but also he could just use one side of the ear buds if he's a side sleeper (meaning he should just use one bud in the ear that isn't pressed against the pillow)."
WhitePeopleTwitter,f2uvdl1,t3_debedu,1570430967.0,"Omg, I used to work for the department that was responsible for doling out the condoms to all the resident halls at this college that had about 30,000 students. I never learned what the exact amount was for the cost of all the condoms; but what I do know is that I had a 20 hour a week summer job (three months) where all I did was put 50 condoms (about) into a little bag, which I then would put the 50-count bags into a larger bag, which I would fill with 150-200 of the smaller 50-count bags. There were 8-10 resident halls/places we distributed them to on campus that all got a big bag of two-hundred 50-count bags to last them for one single semester. The school bought wholesale sized boxes of condoms, which the quantity per box varies wildly between brands, but generally they were between 500-1,000 condoms a box. I have no idea what one of those boxes cost, though. 
So, what I’m saying though is... schools can drop loads of money on condoms to give for free (which hell yeah, take what you can get) but it just makes me wonder how the money is prioritized to begin with, and how they make those decisions.

You know the facts - the challenge you have in front of you seems to have been curated to be your personal form of pure Hell. No joke, you have mental illnesses that are best kept in check if you have a strong support system, and your strong support system has now been taken away from you. What’s worse is that they’re right in view and you can’t touch, you can only look. Another fact - this is temporary, right? If I comprehended correctly? You said “two month minimum” though, which leads me to believe they could string you along on this schedule for a lot longer. And not having an end in sight is too cruel and heinous to go through with it, in my opinion. But, maybe you could try to reframe how you think of this? Perhaps this is your gauntlet, and once you get through it there will be bountiful rewards! If you could get through this, who knows what else you could do! Maybe this is a challenge you CAN accept. Maybe there are ways in which you can feel more of a connection to your fiancé when you’re at work aside from just seeing him for 45 minutes a day. Agree to start leaving love notes for each other for when one of you gets home, or maybe one of you can take a quick video of themselves when nobody is around just making silly faces or whatever it is you two do together to cheer one another up. There are ways to utilize your support system even if they aren’t there in the flesh. 
But maybe doing those things aren’t enough to help you manage through this grueling schedule, and that’s ok. But remember, if you decide to not go through with it and leave the job, you have nothing else to lose, right? So why not tell your boss about your mental health issues? There could be some collaboration between you and them about what serves you and the company best. Maybe your boss can guarantee a stop date for you, if that would help give you the hope you need to get through it. Or something else I can’t even think of. Possibilities could be endless.
It’s good to push yourself out of your comfort zone, and if that’s what this job is doing, maybe try finding a few more options with support from others. But if it’s truly too much, there’s no shame in having to step down to take care of yourself. I hope this helped. Be well."

It doesn’t mean whatever was learned then isn’t reversible, but it is much harder to unlearn things learned during the formative years than to just not teach them in the first place.
Like yeah, the dad (I’m assuming) in this video most likely doesn’t let this baby hit anyone else or even him on a regular basis.
