GriefSupport,fr46b79,t3_gm12za,1589877328.0,"I lost my brother when I was 16, it is not easy losing a sibling because often times the support is directed at the parents which makes sense. I hope you have a lot of support. If you need to talk I have a lot of experience with my grief because it has been nearly 5 years since my brother passed away. Godspeed my friend."

mentalillness,fr2ilas,t3_gm9yo3,1589837923.0,I was thinking about this the other day. I don‚Äôt really know why. I think maybe sometimes people feel unique because of it? A lot of people who glorify it probably don‚Äôt even actually have it because I have severe depression and anxiety and I do not find it fun at all. I think those that glorify it can‚Äôt possibly be feeling it the way most actually mentally ill people do. I may be wrong though.

He kept asking me to do I finally did. He then got super awkward when I was reciting it and he said ‚Äúok stop stop stop‚Äù. Made me feel like shit.... mind you this was a job interview at Panda Express???? Like why you asking me to recite poetry at a food service job lmfao.

I used to think that people were just blissfully ignorant, and life was just not depressing to them because they had no fucking idea what was going on around them. I genuinely cannot imagine anyone not being depressed in this climate. I feel you 100000000%. I have met people who aren't depressed and I can't really click with them. I seem to only click with people who have been through a ton of trauma. I don't even know if I want to be like those people, despite hating my depression..."
