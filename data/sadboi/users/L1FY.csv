GlobalOffensive,evsno4v,t1_evrukov,1564751793.0,"There was one fix where you would underclock your cpu. If you have an i7 7740x and it's base clock is 4.3ghz, underclock it to 3 or 3.5. Course, do not try messing anything in the bios unless you know what you're doing. I won't be held responsible. I'll send you a link in where I found the fix. HOWEVER, do not get your hopes up as I tried it and nothing changed. Plus it makes your pc slightly slower.

Ultimately, I am an introvert and I don't think I can change that. But that's fine, the way you phrased it makes it seem like I don't have to put an appearance for everyone else and I think I'm starting to understand now thanks to all the people in this thread. I do like being by myself but there are times where my friend would ask me to play something and I just don't want to take part. At the same time, I'll start overthinking everything, it happens every time I'm alone and I honestly don't know why I'm like this. I'll work on just enjoying any alone time I have instead of thinking negatively. Honestly, thank you for sharing!!!"
SuicideWatch,esc21u6,t1_esc0tio,1561818885.0,Thanks for the reply! I do try and keep talking about the topics they like. My fear is when they start responding with little words and gives the impression they don't really want to talk. It's not like that all the time obviously but I can't stop thinking if I've said something wrong when they do get quiet. Thanks for the help!

SuicideWatch,esaw9mf,t1_esavnfh,1561770714.0,"It was useful thanks! I'm starting to believe finding new friends would be better for me. I've known my current friends for around 4-5 years but honestly, they don't really show me enough attention or have any interests in the things I like. Thank you!"
SuicideWatch,esavwmq,t1_esavigi,1561770404.0,"Thanks for the reply! And yes! There are times where I do have a good conversation that just goes for hours. But they are extremely rare. And other days I just don't know what to say and just go completely blank and say nothing. After that, it just feels awkward and I keep thinking it's my fault for not saying anything. I'm not diagnosed with bipolar, but something tells me I might have it. One thing I learned from this thread is to just relax about it and don't overthink."
SuicideWatch,esav8cq,t1_esauen3,1561769824.0,"Thanks for the response! Thank you for reassuring me too! I've always thought if it was me that was causing the conversation to go quiet or was it the other side. And yes, please! I'm down to talk!"
SuicideWatch,esav5i2,t1_esatsrx,1561769757.0,Thanks for the response! The thing is I want to make new friends. The issue is that I don't know how to keep them around. And other times I would just cut ties because I feel like I won't talk as much.
SuicideWatch,esav1i1,t1_esatmyc,1561769663.0,Thanks for the response! I'll keep that in mind.
SuicideWatch,esauapq,t1_esasxq5,1561769038.0,"I know your pain 100% but this thread has been super helpful! Main things I learned is to respect yourself, let them know you're trying, stop overthinking and just try to enjoy the conversation. I know for a fact it's gonna be hard to keep thinking like this though. But I'm gonna try since I got nothing to lose."
SuicideWatch,esau4wi,t1_esasri8,1561768901.0,"Thanks for the reply! I love listening to people! But I can't make them keep talking and they just go silent. I do understand why, it's just hard to keep that flow going."
SuicideWatch,esau073,t1_esasplk,1561768792.0,"Thanks for the reply! It's probably best to let people know that you're having struggles. I'll do that next time! However, using filler questions is my go-to, unfortunately. I guess I can bring up what their interests are. Just hope I can hold the conversation until then. Thank you!"
SuicideWatch,esatt9t,t1_esask40,1561768630.0,"Thanks for the reply! I do try and expand what I say. It's just sometimes the way they word it seems like they aren't really interested in talking to me. Like they're half-arsed in what they say. From this thread though, it's because I've been overthinking and I should stop caring."
SuicideWatch,esath6o,t1_esaseeo,1561768350.0,"Thanks for the reply! I'll try and work on it. I've been worried about how others think of me but from this thread, I should stop thinking and enjoy the conversation."
SuicideWatch,esate5j,t1_esas4bv,1561768280.0,"Thanks for the reply! From what I've read in this thread, including your comment, it's all down to just trying to stay chill. Thanks!"
SuicideWatch,esasola,t1_esarr23,1561767684.0,"Thanks for the reply! It seems that confidence is the issue when it comes to talking to people. For me at least. I was in a similar situation when I was able to make loads of friends in middle school. But something happened and I just completely switched off to everyone. I use to talk non stop to my friends and now I can't bring up anything I want to talk about to them. In high school, it just got worse and I only talked to my few friends that luckily stuck by me. I still can't get the issue out though. I passed high school and finished college and now I'm on my way to uni and yet I know for a fact it's gonna be the same. This time without friends. I'll be sitting alone with no one to talk to then I'll end up thinking there's no point to make friends. I don't want that situation to happen. I'll try and work on my confidence but I know for a fact it's something I'll have to gradually work on. Thank you for your story! It has helped a lot! Good luck on your journey too!"
SuicideWatch,esas0uc,t1_esary91,1561767142.0,Thank you for the help honestly! I'll work on it!
SuicideWatch,esarxv2,t1_esarorf,1561767072.0,"Thanks for the extra advice but I've always been too scared to do this. I'm always scared that I'll offend them in any way. When I was young, I was careless of what I say and I would accidentally offend the other person. Now I just don't know what I say would be taken seriously or taken in as a joke. Thank you!"
SuicideWatch,esarrzm,t1_esaqt04,1561766935.0,"Thank you! It's weird. Every time I look at them in the eye, I get a reflex to look at something else. Like turn my head, or pretending to be busy. I hate doing that but I guess I'm gonna have to force myself since there is no other way. Thank you!"
SuicideWatch,esarm0y,t1_esaoy5m,1561766796.0,"I'll try it. What I'm scared of is that if they respond with something vague, like they don't want me to know too much for some reason. I'll try it anyway though. Thank you!"
SuicideWatch,esarg5c,t1_esao0xe,1561766660.0,"I'm really sorry to hear... guess that's why we're all here, looking for guidance. I would focus on myself and see what I can work on. Try doing the same. People in this thread are super helpful."

SuicideWatch,esao54y,t1_esanghi,1561764257.0,Reading this thread just made me realise how it's always about the other person. But I guess if I want to make new friends and keep talking then I'm more than fine with it. Thank you!

SuicideWatch,esanudd,t1_esamk8j,1561764050.0,Ive thought that too. I've always thought I have to give a good impression like I'm meeting someone super important. I wish I can just be chill about it and be myself.
SuicideWatch,esanq6m,t1_esamh5x,1561763970.0,I have a good idea of it now! Thank you for responding!
SuicideWatch,esanl16,t1_esaml50,1561763872.0,Honestly thank you! It makes me so happy just to read this! I need a bit of self confidence and breaks! And I should make sure the things I talk about are things I am interested in and the person I am talking to is also interested. Got it! Thank you for the help! I  cant express it enough. I haven't felt happy for quite a long time but just reading this thread honestly gives me reassurance!
SuicideWatch,esamjjx,t1_esam6c8,1561763144.0,Thanks for the response! And I'm sorry to hear. I get what you mean 100%! I would try to make new friends but the next day I want to disconnect with them because I can't talk. I just don't get why I would rather be alone at times even though I don't want to.
SuicideWatch,esam0gd,t1_esalqnh,1561762773.0,Honestly I'm more than happy to do that!
SuicideWatch,esalxfn,t1_esal92z,1561762714.0,"Thanks for the response! I do talk about their interests. However, sometimes I get the feeling they are bored on what I respond with.

I usually just get the point and just stop talking but I just don't get why?"
SuicideWatch,esakpke,t3_c6q9v1,1561761883.0,I just wanted to say thank you for reaching out to help me.

SuicideWatch,esak172,t1_esajrap,1561761424.0,Thank you! I guess I just need to be chill about it. If it goes quiet then let it be quiet until I have something to ask. Honestly thank you!
SuicideWatch,esajb8g,t1_esaj34y,1561760952.0,I know that for sure.
SuicideWatch,esaj3y3,t1_esairol,1561760819.0,Thank you for responding! It's what I do. I keep asking relevent things about their topic until there's nothing to talk about. The next time I talk to them are usually so awkward because I asked everything I need to know about them and I just sit in silence.
SuicideWatch,esaiq58,t1_esah7yr,1561760567.0,"Wish I could help. Thankfully, two people gave responses if they can help out."
SuicideWatch,esain3g,t1_esahiy3,1561760509.0,Makes me quite upset to know that's probably why I'm so quiet now.
SuicideWatch,esaihf6,t1_esahp11,1561760402.0,"Yeah most of them are video games and music. I love talking about it but sometimes, their responses would be to stay silent or give  a half arsed response. That's why I usually don't talk about my interests since they obviously don't care. Thanks for the response!"
SuicideWatch,esahgqt,t1_esagtsk,1561759716.0,"Thank you for responding! I appreciate it honestly! I do talk about my interests however most of the time they don't ask more about it. When I talk about things I am interested in to my friends, they just stay silent. Then move on. Things like video games and my university course. There is no reason for them to go silent. Unless they are that much uninterested. Fair. I'll stop talking. Thank you for responding."
SuicideWatch,es6mlze,t3_c66lul,1561652703.0,Did you talk to anyone yet? What's brought you down or did something happen? I don't know your life but it must be extremely tough on you. Talk here.
SuicideWatch,erw63k7,t1_erw5h95,1561334295.0,Yeah it sucks. I 100% know what you mean. It's more clearance to let you know they care and want to include you in activities and want you to be part of their group. I honestly hope you go through this.
SuicideWatch,ervtei1,t3_c40k9f,1561324575.0,"I 100% agree. It's one of the reasons why I keep things private to myself now. I know for a fact they don't really care or they look at it as if I'm doing it for attention. The times I have said things about it, they wouldnt understand and tell me what to do instead. Things like ""go to therapy"" ""it will get better"" Truth is I can't go to therapy. I'm too scared to. Hell, I can't look at someone's eyes for longer than a second. However, it's strange to say but, I learnt a lot from sorting problems by myseld (BUT I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND IT). I understand more about myself and know what makes me upset. I'll be honest I'm not ready to kill myself yet. I'm too scared to and I don't want to upset anyone. So for the time being, I'll try and keep myself happy and potentially avoid this situation."
