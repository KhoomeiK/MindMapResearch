I always liked that they kept that in the game because you can tell that Machiavelli (in-game) sees the value and virtue of Cesare, while also believing him to be an evil presence. It grants some much needed and early nuance to both characters.

Selvfølgelig skal det da tages alvorligt, men med en dødelighed så lav (3,4%) ifølge WHO, synes jeg ikke at ""jorden går under"" mentaliteten holder. Specielt, når man tænker at de 3,4% er et globalt gæt og ikke bare i Europa, hvor de fleste har adgang til ordentlig hygiejne og hospitaler.   


Desuden er der andre faktorer i hvorfor det går så galt i Italien. Hvis man kigger på Demografien har italien en af de ældste befolkninger i Europa, med en medianalder omkring 47. Ca. 23% er over 65, så selvfølgelig vil der være en højere belastning i et land som Italien, som har en meget stor udsat gruppe.   


Selv med Italiens horror-historie, som jo selvfølgelig er tragisk, lægger dødsraten for corona stadig ""kun"" på 5%. Igen! Selvfølgelig skal det tages alvorligt. Men jorden går ikke under.

Spike is a tragic character in that he once had such great passion for the world, for love, life and everything in it. The world pushed him towards cruelty and his choices cemented it. I honestly think that that is what Angel and Spike realized when they had the conversation about victimhood at the end of the ""Angel"" series.

>!About a mentally ill potential turned slayer:!<

>! A: ""She is an innocent victim"" !<

>!S: ""So were we once.""!<

What I however agree with this post about is that I love the fact that Spike's character nor the show in general never focus on Spike as a victim, because the way he is now is a result of an answer from Spike to his circumstances, and saying it's all because of his ""tragic"" backstory would be, just like this post, selling his character **way** too short."

A bad person will recognize their wrong doing and not care.
A good person will recognize their wrong doing, take responsibillity and aim to do better. 

In other words, it is never too late to change, and you show signs of wanting to be better, you are well on your way to making that change. 

In regards to your relapse: it is okay. No one wakes up and says: ""I am mentally healthy again."" It's about beating your record again and again. You say it's been months since you were violent, and that's good. Now your mission is to go for that time + a Day (or more). Just keep breaking the record and you will be fine. 

I don't know what to do about your medication, my advice would probably be to go back on it and go into therapy while on it. But that is not the solution for everyone, and I am no doctor or anything like it. However, I would recommend actually seeing a doctor and lay your problems down on the table before him or her. 

Life can be unbearably cruel sometimes, and we sometimes become cruel as a result, that doesn't make us bad people nor does it lock us into cruelty. Not taking responsibillity is what makes us that. And it seems like you are trying to take responsibillity, which is great, but I do not believe you deserve to die, quite the opposite in fact.

Both games are different from Black Flag in gameplay. Ezio's games are older and have some messiness in the controlls. But not much worse than Black Flag in my opinion. 

Origins is more of a numbers RPG where you constantly collect new gear - if that is your thing go for it.
