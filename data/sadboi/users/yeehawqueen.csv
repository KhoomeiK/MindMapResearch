depression,fopr51v,t1_fopr03k,1587969469.0,"i hate you feel the same way. it’s very difficult. and don’t worry, i’m okay"
depression,fopoie1,t1_fopo1fm,1587967191.0,yeah i’ve been diagnosed i was first diagnosed when i was hospitalized at 14. i’m just wishing i can not live so miserably without any help but that’s not going to work
depression,fopnk9i,t1_fopn5fs,1587966393.0,"i’ve tried loving myself. but i just can’t seem to do it. i’ve tried bettering myself with exercise and art and music and going to a college that impresses people around me. i’ve even tried religion. but it just reminds me of how horrible i feel all the time. 

i just don’t understand why someone can’t find it in themselves to love me now when all i’ve ever done for others is love them"
depression,fopm8ky,t1_foplvlg,1587965307.0,i hope that is true. i’ve been searching forever for someone to experience life with me but they never stay. the amount of friends who have dropped me for someone better is far too much.
depression,foplxg5,t1_foplkvc,1587965051.0,i guess that’s true. i just wish i had real friends who cared about me. my former best friend told me she wants nothing to do with me recently. we were so close it was like she was my platonic soulmate. i still haven’t recovered from her cutting me off. it’s times like these where i wish more than anything i can call her and talk. it hurts to see her enjoying life with other people when she doesn’t want me in it
depression,fopl8br,t1_fopkuuy,1587964495.0,"i don’t feel brave or intelligent. i mean,,how could i be if my friends call me fucking stupid all the time. i’m in therapy right now and i’ve tried different meds and i’m so tired of it. it’s not working. i want to be honest with my therapist but it’ll for sure land me in the psych ward again. i can’t go there not again. i just want someone to care deeply for me the way i care about them."
depression,fopjz03,t1_fopjn02,1587963502.0,"normally it wouldn’t bother me but he used to really talk things out with me, help me get to the root of the problem and now he’s just like oh that sucks. it hurt even more when i realized he will always love his girlfriend more than he’ll ever love me (i am so in love with him, but i would never do anything to mess with his relationship) 

i’ve tried painting and drawing and music and netflix but it’s so hard to focus on those things now. talking to my friends helped too but they don’t seem to care

im 19 and i know im young but dear god i want to die so badly"
depression,fopiiay,t1_fophnif,1587962380.0,"i am so alone. i feel as if my friends are absolutely sick of me. i’m so afraid that they think im a horrible person that they dont want to be around anymore. there have been too many instances where they make fun of me for things i like or they’ll insult things about me they know i’m sensitive about. 
i have this very close friend who i’ve known for years who i tell everything to, but i’m afraid he’s getting sick of me too. i’ll tell him something is wrong and he’ll respond with “:(“ or “:/“ and it feels like he’s dismissing my feelings. i can’t talk to my parents because they truly don’t understand why the medicine isn’t working and why i hate being alive so much. it doesn’t help either that im stuck at home with them everyday and they’re always mad at me for soemthing 
every minor inconvenience makes me want to hurt or even kill myself and i had to restrain myself from cutting my wrists with glass shards last night while washing dishes. 
i hate being alive i hate it here"

collegeresults,fc6xddo,t1_fc6jsg5,1577491938.0,lmao my weighted gpa was 4.3 and numbers aren’t the only thing that get you into a college but ok
collegeresults,fc6x5d5,t1_fc6s8ow,1577491772.0,"it’s definitely a hard school, but everyone is so supportive of the things you do, and they really do want to see you succeed. im about to start my 3rd semester but so far i’ve been getting As and Bs in all my classes. living there is p cool, but tbh the dorms aren’t the best but they’re alright(however Glenn or Towers building is AMAZING, if u want a better chance to live there then send your housing/application deposit ASAP). you will definitely have some tough times there, and the mental health services aren’t famous for being useful from what i’ve heard, so i recommend seeking outside help if you need mental healthcare. honestly i love being at tech because i can already see how i’m learning to think critically and have a good work ethic. also the people there are so kind and helpful and it just warms my heart tbh. i have some friends and they’re awesome and it’s cool to see how so many different people have come together at one school. sometimes people get really intense with their studying around midterms and finals but you’ll catch on to what will work for you and what won’t. if you have any other questions feel free to PM me !"
