You‚Äôre on the right track, even if you find being kind to yourself is hard right now- it is the best way forward. Picture yourself as a kid, before anyone had any expectations of you, before you had tasks to be accomplished. How would you react if that child was hurt or sad? You would want someone to treat you with care, understanding and compassion. It is will be a process to reframe your thinking but it will be a rewarding one. 

Your worth does not come from your productivity output, you are loved and cared for because you are human and we all have good in us. And that is enough."

The cats will play fight, it may look and sound scary- I would definitely monitor the interactions at first, spending a little more time together each time. Involve treats, give attention to the older cat to make them feel comfortable, and then separate if you see any signs of stress then repeat. All 3 of our cats have now been living together successfully for about 6 months (the move was quite recent).

I did hate working out after a while because I was doing it for the wrong reasons.

I was also going to the gym 3 times a week for high rep, low weight exercises such as cable crunches and a lot of leg work. Yes, I had double workout days. 

My diet mainly consists of high protein (chicken, fish, protein supplements), high quality fats (2 avocados a day, nuts, etc.), loads of fresh veggies, minimal amount of added sugar (fruit or otherwise) and ALWAYS staying in a caloric deficit. Should also mention that I do not eat dairy bc I'm lactose intolerant and use a lactose free protein powder.

For the purpose of providing energy, your body doesn't know the difference between a calorie from a chicken nugget or a calorie from a piece of lettuce.
