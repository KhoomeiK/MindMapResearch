I checked the updated state guidelines and they're trying to roll out things as best they can. On April 25, self employed individuals will be allowed to apply and successfully receive benefits. Believe me, I'm stressed and working hard. Typing on the internet is not a good way to transmit emotional understanding. All self employed have to sit tight until then. If you're not self employed then you have no idea the hoops we've had to jump through so far.

I'm only speaking to my own experience and trying to answer the questions as accurately as possible. It's completely okay if people are skeptical of the answers and questioning.

Retconned,fjnsn1v,t1_fjnptuj,1583513683.0,"Some information is gathered in the days and months after. Some studies of a specific outbreak aren't completed for years after the event; that's usually when people look back and say 'wow, didn't know it was that serious'. The 50 million number is an estimate because after the fact it hard to be accurate without everyone being tested as they were ill. Again, H1N1 was really just a flu strain that was new to a lot of the population,  therefore more people were miserable because your immune system is having to learn. The numbers some times come from patient/doctor interviews after an event is over. H1N1 is now considered a pretty common variant of flu that cycles around every year. The number may have been less, may have been greater, it's really just a number. General testing for infectious diseases doesn't really happen like TV and movies. H1N1 deaths could also have been higher than realized but it was just a flu and they just simply marked cause of death as flu. Solely relying on the numbers makes everything seems worse. You have to take into account that people already knew how to treat a flu and you really didn't need to do much more, including doctors who were confident that people would recover. Also take into account the number of people living period. 50 million seems like a large number by itself until you compare it to the population. If you or anyone you know weren't affected by it, consider yourself lucky (I'm absolutely thrilled so many people didn't have to deal with it!) and you (and the area you live) just may have a low risk for infection."

Retconned,fjma0gw,t1_fjm9346,1583465127.0,Hospitals didn't have to manage because most people stayed home with what they thought was regular flu. The ones who went to ER were more than likely topped up on fluids with an IV and sent home not even realizing the specific strain of flu they had.
Retconned,fjm8rcu,t3_fe6qy7,1583464257.0,"As someone who had, tested for and came up positive with, H1N1 I can tell you that number is about right. H1N1 came on like the regular flu; sudden and unrelenting. SARS-coV-2 comes on gradually which makes it a little more sneaky. The day I stumbled into the urgent care, it was full of people and I was told it had been a long couple of weeks for the doctors. H1N1 wove so tightly into the regular flu crowd that they just treated most of us like it was the regular. Go home, rest, keep fluids up, if you get worse head to the hospital and tell them you have H1N1. It was really a meh event in the scales of apocalyptic viruses.

Edit: I think we all need to realize that just because you have THE illness doesn't mean you're in a bad way in the hospital. Some people can test positive and have very little symptoms. Most of us with H1N1 avoided the hospital by simply being able to keep up with the fluid loss. A lot people of people tested positive on the back end of their illness because they  felt good enough to make to the GP when they were already getting better. The numbers are probably accurate but lots of people weren't waiting for death."

I almost threw up on the doctor the first attempt, the second time they gave me pain meds, muscle and cervical relaxers to take an hour beforehand....did not work at all. They were very sceptical that I had even taken them but my mother was with me and she had seen me do it. Finally was able to get it in under general and subsequently through IV sedation. I have the beginnings of endo and it was extremely important to get the IUD in place so they could monitor me. Feel fortunate you can have it done with little intervention but believe the rest of us when we say it hurts badly. I have often been scoffed at and told I just need to toughen up because of the pain. I would much rather give birth again than get another IUD without sedation!"
AskReddit,fiti6rh,t3_f9kd1v,1582720827.0,"Laying on a couch, in my son's high school, waiting for an ambulance. I had been fine all day, moved furniture for a client with no issues. I had suddenly felt the need to lay down in the middle of a conversation and the words 'you need to go to hospital' kept repeating in my head. I messaged my son that I was coming to pick him up and I needed him to drive me to the hospital. When I got to the school, it took all my strength to not collapse in the lobby and I must have looked bad because I was immediately pulled into room to lay down. At the hospital they ran a bunch of tests (plus I barfed on their floor and shit all over myself, with no help cleaning myself up. Thanks Duke) and a whole 20 hours in the ER later; the closest to an answer they would give me was that maybe I had gone into shock due to maaaaaaybeee a septic infection. I was hooked up to IV antibiotics and given a script for more super strong  antibiotics, then shoved out the door. Still no solid answer on what caused the episode but whatever it was seemed to be cleared out by the strong (and fucking expensive) antibiotics.  It sucked for quite a while and my doctor was PISSED I wasn't admitted but I'm currently alive so there's a postive!"

MaladaptiveDreaming,esfz7d7,t3_c7kwdf,1561938800.0,"What you have to understand about mental health is, mental wellness/illness is very fluid. A LOT of mental issues share the same symptoms and it takes a professional to wade through it all and come to a working conclusion. Very simple things can be masked as big things and vice versa. When you're already in a state of fear/panic everything looks bad. The best thing you can do for yourself is find a mental health professional that you trust and be honest with them. That's the hard and scary part, but I'm confident that you can do that. Don't forget that you can always change providers if you don't feel you have a connection. Be kind to yourself, you deserve it.

Edit: forgot to add that their are many free or low cost clinics. Depending in circumstances, any public hospital with a psych/Neuro sciences department also has a financial charity care program you can enroll in. A Google search for the hospital name and ""financial assistance"" should get you a number to call ask about help with the medical expenses."
