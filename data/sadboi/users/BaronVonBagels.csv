ACQR,flt5jre,t1_flqv2xw,1585459947.0,"It’s mainly just that if you aren’t careful you can lose villagers if it seems you abandoned them for months (skipping long periods), and the town can get over run with weeds or what have you, or if you do any sort of bell hack then that can take away the drive to do anything else (collect bugs, hunt for things to sell, etc)? But it’s kinda personal preference! I suggest just playing however suits you best! It’s your game. :) Theres a couple guides that explain it a little more clearly if you look up Animal Crossing New Horizons time traveling!"
ACQR,flno875,t1_flnnb19,1585322669.0,"Honestly, I do it in small amounts (generally one day at a time-and sparingly) and I’m still unlocking stuff- and can’t even terraform yet- and still having fun! Hasn’t ruined the desire to collect and sell things and I’m not out of new things to do! But bell hacks and skipping forward too far can be detrimental."
ACQR,flnmbjp,t1_flmfht4,1585321573.0,Once you unlock them you can share it. Takes a couple real life days unless you time skip.

rarepuppers,f2euf2w,t1_f2et5qk,1570204163.0,This is the exact place for one to make comments. You’re in the wrong place to get buttmangled about people talking to one another. Lol. You also DIDN’T mind your own business by making your rude comment. Just FYI.
RBI,f1q7ffa,t3_dad6yt,1569694996.0,Go to the Search Team and Search Squad on Facebook! They help people find other people. They’re amazing at it. They gave me all the info I needed within 24 hours.

mentalillness,f0182v0,t3_d2ry3e,1568311542.0,"Every day feels like I’m being held down; it hurts, it’s tiring, it makes me so angry sometimes. 
I can’t drive, can’t go out, can’t be around people, can’t think without my body physically locking up. 
It often feels like life is a movie. 
I have trouble breathing now."
mentalillness,f017bsy,t1_ezy8ng2,1568311293.0,You actually sound like the kind of clinician I’d love. I like your approach. I wish you luck.
TalesOfWind,eyumx2q,t3_cyvkvc,1567466516.0,They expire after the event. They do not carry over. And the amount of silver star they convert to really isn’t worth it either imo. I’d use em up.

wholesomememes,esn2owx,t1_esn2ei6,1562121127.0,"That can happen from a lot of caffeine, had a doctor tell me and I know when I was drinking soda like crazy my breast tissue was much lumpier and when I gave it up they were much softer and smoother tissue! Not sure if that helps you but personally that was the cause for me!"
