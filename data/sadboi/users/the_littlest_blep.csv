AmItheAsshole,fqiqu16,t1_fqiq1u0,1589399634.0,"I think it's important to get your husband to understand that you can do basically all of the same things with daughters as you can do with sons! You can use me as an example if you'd like :P I'm a 25yo woman, and growing up, I did LOVE doing things with my mom like baking and crafts and gardening - but I also LOVED to sit with my dad and camp, work on his truck, go fishing, and shoot BBs! You can pass down the things you love to your children, no matter their gender."
AmItheAsshole,fqildcs,t1_fqikbah,1589397542.0,"Unfortunately, that doesn't mean much. A lot of dog-fighters take to social media to show off their new 'stock' and use code in their comments so that they can discuss the new dogs they get. Since he's a puppy, if this IS what's happening, that might buy him some time. But definitely, definitely call the police and give them everything you have, ASAP.

Maybe they ARE just assholes who tried to steal your dog for themselves, but it's unfair to the defenseless dog to just assume it isn't more sinister than that. Best of luck with the police investigation."

AmItheAsshole,fqijf86,t3_gj4mzp,1589396798.0,"NTA, you just gave birth! It's exceptionally normal to be sluggish and not contribute to the household evenly for weeks after that, or sometimes even months. It sounds like your husband is accepting of what's going on, and that's what really matters. Try to relax, and focus on healing and keeping you and your babies healthy. If you really feel guilty, maybe ask your husband outright if he feels unfairly burdened. And then LISTEN to his answer."

No one single person is a good enough support system for someone where they should'nt need to go looking somewhere else. 

You scare me, and YTA without a doubt. I'm hoping the first thing your daughter does once she leaves your household is go get the help she KEEPS TELLING YOU SHE NEEDS."

Her underwear are  no dirty,just stained, and whether her underwear are stained is really none of your business anyway.

AmItheAsshole,fq4p5r5,t3_ggkfdz,1589080945.0,"YTA for the following reasons

1. Thinking it's 'unfair' to be tasked with raising another man's child; that baby is innocent of any crime and needs love, not resentment

2. Resenting your son; he is absolutely faultless in this, even if he WASN'T biologically your son

3. Letting people get to you; being married to a woman of a different ethnicity, you should've made it your business to know that 'genetics are weird' as you put it. Instead, you let gossiping people's rude suggestions turn your ear, and you doubted your wife's fidelity

4. Doubting your wife's fidelity; without IRREFUTABLE proof, this usually makes you an asshole, point blank, because it's such a serious aspersion/accusation

5. Doing the test in secret; at some point, you really believed more than you didn't, that your son was someone else's and that your wife cheated. That is SERIOUSLY damaging, even if you'd turned out to be right. A lot of relationships never come back from that sort of distrust.

A week on the couch & you think that's too much? You're seriously out of touch here. If I was your wife and I found out that you tested our sons DNA behind my back because you thought I cheated, because he didn't look enough like you, I would in all likelihood leave you."

AmItheAsshole,fpufhdo,t3_gfc7ka,1588911585.0,"NTA! Yeah, you SHOULD break up - not because you're selfish (you aren't.) Because your bf is a freak.

Seriously, what kind of grown man makes fun of his SIGNIFICANT OTHER because they speak another language?? A very useful skill? Especially when it's their mother tongue, and a source of cultural pride?? He seriously sounds like an awful person, I am SURE you could do better.

And I was so scared to navigate the halls alone that I'd just sob. Both my parents had to work & couldn't bring me themselves, and it broke their hearts.

My bus driver's name was Bonnie - a loud, badass, take-no-shit old woman with a white coiffure and perfect manicure. After just one week of seeing little me trembling like a jello, she pulled me aside when we got to the school, said 'hang on', waited until everyone else got off the bus, then turned the bus off, locked it up, jumped out, took me by the hand, and walked me into the school, to my locker, and then to my first morning class.

From the description you gave, I'm thinking that your issue might have less to do with your BF's size & more to do with something medical on your end. You should look up the condition called Vestibular Vulvodynia, and see if it sounds familiar to what you experience.

You can't help having enduring feelings - but you CAN help how you deal with them. You decided to get married to someone who wasn't the love of your life - you need to prioritize that marriage. 

I do wonder, though: does your HUSBAND know that you don't love him as much as you love your ex? Did he know that BEFORE you got married? It seems unfair to let someone marry you, without knowing they're playing second fiddle.

&

Because you told her she was being ridiculous. First off, that's just rude and uncalled for. No wonder she got mad at you. And secondly, she WASNT being ridiculous. That isn't 'just the style', it's called 'objectification' and you should google it.

He also is unsuccessful in non-familial relationships, and struggled heavily for years with ideals that were misogynistic. After years of hard work, he's made serious progress. But it took hundreds of arguments. Being truthful with him about these issues is the kindest thing you could do for him, ultimately.

AskReddit,fp68jm8,t3_gbde0g,1588348001.0,"For a good memory of my parents together:

My stepdad has a learning disorder and was raised by fairly negligent farmers, whose primary language was French. Long story short, he's always struggled with his literacy and handwriting. Despite this, he toiled to write my mother an original love poem, about how much he adores and cherishes her. I got to glance it over once when mom and me were having a girls day. She keeps it in a little chest of special things. It was entitled 'For My Lady'.

Bonus nice memory: like I said, dad struggles with his literacy. I, conversely, have always excelled at it. One day when I was about 9 or 10, he called me down to our basement where we kept our computer. He was staring at a word document and I could all but see the smoke coming from his ears. He told me that he had to write an official statement for his work - unusual, in his field. And he asked ME for help writing it, because 'you've always been so good with words and I need this to sound perfect'. Since then, I'm always the one dad goes to when he needs help with writing something, and I grew up randomly hearing him shout ""Littlest_Blep, how do you spell _____?' and me just shouting back how to spell it. I love that man."

So I didn't really understand why he was suddenly in the dad role, and not my actual dad (who is not the best guy). It took me about a year to warm up to my step dad. I remember just walking up to him where he sat at the dining room table in our tiny apartment and matter of factly saying 'I love you. You're good.'

AskReddit,fn4xssb,t1_fn4xkbl,1586651325.0,Ugh. I'm currently sitting in a campaign run by my partner's brother. So if I left it'd be big drama 🙄 but he's legit the WORST railroader I've ever had to play under and I feel like I'm being lobotomized
AmItheAsshole,fn4qcwn,t1_fn4pyxk,1586646707.0,"Holy shit..I had no idea. I guess at 25 I'm old and out of the loop. When I was that age, getting engaged was seen as the absolute biggest loser thing you could do"
AmItheAsshole,fn4mhzu,t1_fn403qw,1586644437.0,Thank you for this. This is exactly right. Assholes like OP's boyfriend give me a lot of anxiety and I wish I could take this exact message and just SMASH it into their brains until they get it. I'm glad to see that so many people understand and are good-hearted.
AmItheAsshole,fn4lvjz,t3_fzdz5p,1586644069.0,"God, all I've read is the title, and I already feel like you should rehome your boyfriend and keep your cat.

Like ???? My husband is mildly ALLERGIC to my cats & still never suggested I rehome them. 

NTA, keep your cat."
AmItheAsshole,fn4jew2,t3_fyxays,1586642602.0,"That is fucking WEIRD, and I think you probably need to drop this friend. This was not okay of her AT ALL. NTA"
AmItheAsshole,fn4ggjn,t3_fz8f9k,1586640885.0,"OP, that is SO creepy and weird. Paying for his portion of the GROCERIES doesn't get him COOKED MEALS. Tell him he has no right to expect this of you. Jeez :/ NTA"
AmItheAsshole,fn46h51,t1_fn435os,1586635032.0,"Yeah, those are all valid points. Do you have any idea how she got it in her head that a speedy engagement = loving her more? Because that is an ALARMINGLY quick engagement and she seems to be seeing it as more of a status symbol than the huge deal that it is."
