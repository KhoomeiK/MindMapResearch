OP I also considered mentioning IFS which is short for Internal Family Systems therapy... but I didn‚Äôt want to list too many therapies and decided to focus on telling you about the most somatic (body) oriented ones as contemporary research research shows that in order to heal from trauma it‚Äôs best to work bottom up rather than top down, which is to say to start from the body and work up to the mind, rather than the other way round which is how all therapy used to be in Western practices (think psychoanalysis, talk therapy, cbt) prior to the research that lead to recognition of trauma as a thing, and a thing that is stored in our body, especially effecting our nervous system. I don‚Äôt know if you guys are at the stage where you want to learn lots about trauma and why she has these flashback and what can be done, but just in case you are I will mention that the book ‚ÄòThe Body Keeps the Score‚Äô is the most incredibly eye opening and informative place to start :) Therapies like EMDR and IFS are explained well in there, with case studies demonstrating the healing that is possible.

Back to what I was saying about IFS though - it has been recognised that trauma, such as child sexual abuse, fragments the self into many parts, and some of those parts hold memories and feelings that other parts don‚Äôt.. and often when something is incredibly painful such as being violated as a child then a part will form that holds the effect of that experience and lives on inside of us in a way that remains stuck at that age. So Internal Family Systems helps us get to know our own inner internal family of parts and eventually helps the wounded parts release the burden they are carrying. This still is at quite a mind level though so it‚Äôs important to do other somatic/trauma therapies in conjunction with IFS, such as the ones I originally listed."

Something else that comes to mind is that some people say trauma‚Äôs of omission (experiences where something you needed, say care, was not there ie. neglect, isolation) can be best healed in relationship ie. you finally get what was needed back then.

Psilocybin (magic mushrooms) is another medicine that can bring you out of deep depression. Do you have access to them?"
mdmatherapy,fnu52mp,t3_g3rrp8,1587254703.0,"I‚Äôve done one psilocybin session with a therapist and three psilocybin sessions solo replicating as best I could the therapeutic set and setting. I‚Äôve also done two MDMA sessions with a therapist. I definitely think a psilocybin session is ‚Äòworth it‚Äô! However, in my personal experience it has been most profound with a therapist. One of my main defences is intellectualising and when I‚Äôve done solo sessions I have struggled to come out of my head and to surrender. I found myself trying to be my own therapist which conflicted with letting go. All my psilocybin sessions have felt painful through out, except the session with the therapist where I had an unexpected window into a very subtle n beautiful experience, followed by a lot painful reliving trauma, followed by an eventual sense of safety in my vulnerability through contact with the therapist. Ending in the safety felt really significant. This session felt quite profound for me and for sometime after I was in a deeply self-compassionate and self-trusting grief process that was wholly unfamiliar and very cleansing. In my solo sessions I have struggled to find a felt sense of safety or softness. It can be pretty raw! That said I do feel I still processed trauma, saw/felt painful things very clearly, gained insights and directions and benefited from the reset and after glow. Psilocybin is known to be very helpful for bringing people out of depression, though not permanently. I‚Äôm considering taking doses somewhat regularly (as well as microdosing) to help with my depression. Psilocybin is considered to be ‚Äòmore advanced medicine‚Äô (than MDMA) by my therapist and I have heard this echoed by others in the field such as Saj Ravzi from Innate Path/MAPS. This makes sense to me as I feel it is more dynamic than MDMA. Have you been through the conversations on the PsychedelicTherapy sub?

mdmatherapy,fn68j1y,t3_fz8wmh,1586691552.0,"Seconding TRE. My psychedelic therapist advised me to practice TRE daily. I think it‚Äôs a good one because it‚Äôs somatic, simple and pretty easy to teach yourself. And you only need to do a little bit at a time. Here‚Äôs a bit more info on the background of it:

 https://www.acesconnection.com/blog/what-is-trauma-release-exercises-tre

And here‚Äôs the main TRE webpage:

https://traumaprevention.com

You‚Äôll notice there are teachers who‚Äôll do an online session with you during this time, and there‚Äôs some free group online TRE teaching sessions happening too. Listed under ‚Äòtrainers‚Äô or ‚Äòtraining‚Äô I think it was. But if you want to just teach yourself there‚Äôs plenty of video‚Äôs. You only need to practice a little bit at a time.. and try it out first.. like do 5 mins and build your way up to 20 mins, cos apparently it can be activating for some people. 

I agree with the other suggestions from everyone who has responded so far, though some are easier to practice alone than others and some might help you out down the track more so than in this acute stage you‚Äôre in.. for example Internal Family Systems (IFS), Somatic Experiencing (SE), Hakomi, EMDR are all types of therapy really worth considering if/when you can access therapy, and for now it may be worth looking into the audio resources for practicing IFS and SE alone as I have seen many times ppl posting about some good programs though I don‚Äôt know the names/links to them myself (I‚Äôm sure if you posted asking you would find out). It‚Äôs not advised to do EMDR alone and Hakomi isn‚Äôt so much a self practice I don‚Äôt think think, it‚Äôs a Mindful Somatic style of  psychotherapy, I mentioned it cos it‚Äôs one of the trainings I look out for when looking for a trauma therapist. 

But as for integrating alone Pete Walker - who another poster suggested you read the book by - has some good self practice guides on his website, for example this one on emotional flashbacks:

http://pete-walker.com/pdf/emotionalFlashbackManagement.pdf

He also has lots of good articles and I think some chapters of his book up on his website. I‚Äôve found it can feel very validating and reassuring to read about what I‚Äôm going through... sometimes it helps me disidentify from the young trauma state that I‚Äôm in. Or just to feel valid and soften my shame which can be the worst state of all. The other book suggested by another poster ‚ÄòThe Body Keeps the Score‚Äô has also had this effect for me profoundly. Be aware some people find the case studies in it triggering, though some express it is the good kind of triggering (if that exists) or worth it because of how enlightening it is. But maybe not ideal for the early/acute stages of integration. 

Tbh I‚Äôve found, like another said, that at times all I can do is hold myself and cry and put myself to bed... then do what I could to ground myself which would usually be tune into the sensations in my body and slow my breath down, then will myself out of bed and out the door for a walk. Maybe listen to a recording by Tara Brach on the walk. Turns out that walking and exercising are as important as everyone always said :) Practicing yoga through online videos is an accessible integration practice during these corona times (these are easy ones to start with https://yogawithadriene.com). Also breathing - deep soft belly breathing, or slowing your breath ie. 4 second inhale 7 seconds hold 8 seconds exhale - it‚Äôs a very good trick for grounding, regulating your nervous system. I don‚Äôt know if grounding practices are integration so much as they are essential preliminary practices to work with in order to then do integration work in a way that‚Äôs not retraumatising. We have to get back into our ‚Äòwindow of tolerance‚Äô first then we can welcome the feelings that are coming up in way that is not overwhelming (from a down-regulated state). 

Wishing you well <3"

Hold tight to your truth, and when you doubt yourself read what you have written here but imagining it was written by someone else... I believe you will see that you are saving yourself and, sadly your friend is being drawn into your abusers power, you still need to keep on saving yourself.. you need to move away from her."

relationship_advice,fmsb78s,t3_fx31dj,1586351604.0,"Hey I imagine it‚Äôs pretty intense receiving all the strong messages from everyone who has responded. I really want to express that it is understandable that you wrote the post the way you did, that you have felt you just want to know a way to sort it out with him, not to break up with him... it is all understandable, I imagine you are doing the best you can with what you have. There can be a subtle and often unconscious way we turn others disrespect of us into a disrespect of ourselves and the cycle goes on and on... until something more awful than all the awful that came before somehow wakes us up... I‚Äôm imagining that this might be that time for you and that by posting the details of what you are living with here and receiving the unanimous responses, that you may now go into some level of shock as you see the corner that you are needing to turn. I hope you can hold yourself with as much forgiveness and love as possible as you face this. I hope you can reach out to a sexual assault crisis line and speak to a counsellor. I hope you are in a position financially and logistically that supports you to take the steps you need to take. I hope you can create a safe plan for you and your child with the help of the counsellor and any trusted loved ones you feel you can confide in. 

I have been through similar experiences, with different men. I had a much older boyfriend who abused me and looking back I see he was attracted to the power imbalance. And I had a boyfriend who sexually assaulted me in my sleep, though at first I didn‚Äôt even recognise it as assault (at least not cognitively, but somatically I sure as hell did and I‚Äôm still trying to work through the trauma imprinted into my body today), but then it got worse, I woke up to what felt like him trying to destroy me, I was terrified, and yet I froze, dissociated... long story is getting long, but I did get the hell away and 2 years on I‚Äôm so glad for it, he was sick, he harmed me, it took me some time to untangle my emotional attachment to him but I got there and I‚Äôm so SO glad he is not my boyfriend anymore. I guess what I‚Äôm getting at is if you need to chat I‚Äôm here without judgment, but not without the same clarity of all other responders - this is rape, it is best you leave."
CPTSD,fms75ry,t1_fms56st,1586348593.0,"I‚Äôve started practising it with a therapist who is trained in it (as well as a couple of other modalities of therapy) and it‚Äôs a gradual process of getting to know your parts.. I feel I‚Äôm still early in the process because I‚Äôve been dealing with a lot of overwhelm and a lot of sessions have needed to focus on helping me ground and self-regulate. Only if I‚Äôm grounded will my therapist then guide me into the deep internal inquiry that creates a kind of meeting and getting to know and hopefully soothing of a ‚Äòpart‚Äô who is there that day.. it‚Äôs been very rich I would say.. it‚Äôs like this whole world in there! The parts are often very young and extreme in their ways.. there are parts that play protective roles for our most vulnerable and rejected parts.. for example I have a protector part who is very convinced that she needs to ‚Äòfigure everything out‚Äô and she serves me well to a certain extent (ie. I‚Äôm quite intellectual, I have researched my healing path well..) but she also keeps me relentlessly in my head and inhibits me from surrendering to feeling my feelings... she is trying to protect my more vulnerable parts which in IFS are referred to as exiles... I have only met an exile in me once and it was incredible - I had been in such a bad way for a couple of days at a level that was rare for me, I was feeling so mentally deranged that I was seriously wishing I could get checked in to a psyche ward, I was convinced I‚Äôd lost it and I felt far away from everyone like miles away from my friend who sat with me through some of this time and I felt very nauseous for no good reason... then I went to my regular therapy and I described my state to my therapist and we went in (closed eyes, followed her subtle guided inquiry, reporting back what I noticed) to meet the parts that were there that day and I saw this little child, a baby, she seemed to be poisoned, but also sacred and she desperately needed caring elders to gather round her and be with her.. my therapist was able to help me carefully visualise/manifest a sense of some of this deep communal care for her with me... it was a very deep process... as the session came to an end and I opened my eyes and came back into the room I felt completely different - the nausea was gone, I felt well, grounded, myself and when I saw my friend after I felt close to her again in a regular way. It was quite incredible! I was back in what IFS refers to as Self :)"

Please please look into it, I don‚Äôt think I can do it justice describing it here... but I can say it‚Äôs a very well regarded trauma therapy. And working with it would be a profound way of stepping into these different parts of your self further and healing their pains. What a profound dream already!

PsychedelicTherapy,fmj5sc6,t1_fmfdsmm,1586123606.0,Thanks for replying.. yes I have been introduced to TRE by my psychedelic therapist. My body goes into the tremors the moment I put it in the basic TRE position when I‚Äôm laying down on the medicines and he has commented on this and suggests I would benefit from practicing it everyday. I haven‚Äôt created an everyday habit with it yet but I do practice it maybe once a week. Tbh I do other physical practices like yoga more often because they feel better... I‚Äôm not familiar with Dr Bercelli‚Äôs literature on the benefits of TRE for muscle pain specifically so I will look into that now.
KindVoice,fmdvavg,t3_fuksty,1585979106.0,Congratulations! I hope this is the beginning of a much better time for you and your daughter. I don‚Äôt know where you are so I don‚Äôt know what services to suggest precisely.. but I agree very much with the comment above about reaching out and seeing where the help comes from as it will probably be somewhere you did not expect. I also just want to suggest that you make sure that wherever you go there is no way your abuser could guess or find out that you are there. The time directly after leaving is commonly the most dangerous.

CPTSD,fmagsb0,t1_fm7a7xf,1585893632.0,I‚Äôve been wondering about the connection between endometriosis and trauma.. for me I was diagnosed with adenomyosis 1 year after the last/worst sexual assault (as an adult).. but had pretty awful period pain since from the beginning..

I also have/had psoriasis, hyperthyroidism, hyperthyroid attack, hypothyroidism, digestive problems (including stomach ache every morning as a child), migraines, chronic infections, weak kidneys, minor allergies, teeth grinding... congenital cataract (born with one blind eye.. actually fits more in the cause part of my picture than in consequence)...

It‚Äôs impossible to count how many Dr‚Äôs and practitioners I have been to in my life... only to be told ‚Äòit‚Äôs stress related‚Äô and there‚Äôs little to nothing they can recommend."
PsychedelicTherapy,fm8wyep,t3_fj7r19,1585857568.0,"I‚Äôm curious to hear more from everyone about the lasting muscular release? Has anyone had, for example, a chronic holding pattern/area of muscle pain go away completely after working with these compounds? 
I‚Äôm some way into my process working with MDMA, psilocybin and San Pedro, and I have found my body does a lot of trembling and larger movements during the sessions, however my chronic muscle pain has not improved.

It is very common for survivors to develop trauma around a situation like this one with your friend, on top of the trauma of the assault. It‚Äôs frightening to add the loss of your main friends to a trauma in which you already lost so much. I believe you could respectfully communicate to her how seriously her behaviour is affecting you and if she does not have the capacity to understand your position and seriously wake up, which it sadly sounds like she may not, then I think it‚Äôs best to cut ties with her completely in this time, knowing you did your best."

Last night was terrible, the hyperarousal then dissociation had me up til 3am, now it‚Äôs nearly 3pm and I‚Äôm still in bed. I tried my grounding techniques but couldn‚Äôt ride the wave. So lonely and it‚Äôs too exhausting to keep trying to explain to others who don‚Äôt live it.

I wanted to say I see you as noble and with integrity when you write that you are staying home because you do not want to  spread the virus unknowingly and be the cause for someone else falling severely ill. I hope you can take some nourishment from knowing this about yourself. I see anyone who is taking social-isolation seriously as wise. I‚Äôm struggling with feelings towards those who aren‚Äôt too.

You are absolutely right there is a lot going on and it‚Äôs compounding what was already going on for you. I understand why you self-injured after you got denied the injunction against your abuser - you didn‚Äôt mess up by going back to this coping strategy. 

I had a similar issue a few weeks ago with victims services insisting on contacting my abuser and I immediately went into a shutdown state, then blurted out in front of people who don‚Äôt understand ‚ÄòI want to slit my wrists‚Äô. I was so ashamed. But think about it, if I were with you when I blurted that out you would‚Äôve understood. Same goes for my understanding you. 

Thanks for venting about your emotional  flashbacks too. I‚Äôm just coming to understand that this is a thing that I‚Äôm experiencing. 

I wrote such a long rant and posted here last night and the reminder I received in a reply that stays with me today is we need to anchor ourselves into the present moment with mindfulness. I know this is not much. I see your pain."
