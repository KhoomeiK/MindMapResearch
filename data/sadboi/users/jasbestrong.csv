raisedbynarcissists,flwyqwe,t3_frpgad,1585570145.0,"therapy is always a good thing.
remember that you’re no longer a child and right now, it may be best to look forward rather than back but it’s always good to find a therapist that can help you discover who you were and work on getting to who you are now and who you can be in the future.

it’s taken 10+ yrs for me to get to this point so you don’t need to rush. healing will take time.

I had a similar childhood plus teenage years, I was always drunk or some other self-harm type situation. 

It starts with a decision to want to be better which helps with moving forward. 
example: “oh so i have a mental illness.” —take steps to manage
“oh i have anxiety?” —enroll in art therapy and exercise daily
“oh i am afraid to be alone?” —learn that it’s perfectly okay to be in solitude and practice self-discovery.
“trauma?” —therapy therapy

childhood memories don’t have to be great to be good. in the midst of abuse, I remember my favorite food, the day trees looked green and fresh when i got my first pair of glasses that kind of thing. the smile on my friends face when i told her a joke, etc."

whenever she felt like i needed someone, she’d show up and talk to me about how i was doing the right thing.

it was when i spoke to my sister and we had gotten closer that I was able to express my concerns. she was the one who said that it was not a healthy relationship. she reminded me day in day out of why i was doing it especially when the good, manipulating mood would replace the angry, violent mood and i would second guess myself.

BPD,fgoutri,t3_ezqs77,1580987628.0,"first of all,
who are you really angry with?

have you experienced any trauma in your life that could be associated with this anger?

second,
if you start to feel angry toward your sister. walk away. go out and ground yourself. take a long walk to release you from all your pent up energy.

exercise is good for anger management. yoga in particular. search inside flow yoga in youtube.


art is the best for anger management. even if you’re not particularly good at it, sign up for sculpting class or sketching or painting. “paint your anger” in angry birds is actually accurate.

if you can afford therapy, go. talk to someone. 
the only way anger is released is releasing it in more positive ways. 

hope this helps."

Open our eyes to what you need us to see
Forgiving our past iniquity
