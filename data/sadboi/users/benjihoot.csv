Или вот ещё: «Дмитрий Сергеевич, вашего сына выпиздили из Оксфорда». А на самом деле выпиздить его из Кембриджа.


И так — во всём. Вообще во всём. «Дмитрий Сергеевич, мы вас ведём на допрос на пятый этаж в Следственный комитет». И отвести его на четвёртый этаж в Генпрокуратуру. «Дмитрий Сергеевич, к вам мама на свидание». И привести вместо мамы дочь.

Instead of stimulating people to learn how to live with and around issues people normalised banning anything that makes them afraid, uncomfortable and pretend problem does not exist by getting it out of sight. I’m sorry if I’m triggering anyone, but it is just psychology: when they teach you to work with ocd, panic, anxiety, ptsd.. the idea is that you overcome trying to avoid things that scare or worry you, doesn’t mean you have to like them but if you’re hypochondriac, you learn to stop going to see doctor after every sneeze, you learn to accept that there are things you can’t control and it’s ok. There is healthy avoidance, like you don’t blow up fireworks in your face, but hiding under your bed because something somewhere can explode is unhealthy and shouldn’t be supported by society as a way out, but it is. Life is a risk in itself, but people don’t want to accept that. Death to many seems to be something that happens to someone else or at least has a long preexisting history, a lot of things can be cured today. People are not used to it and they learned to run away from what’s scary or just move it to Asia, pretend it’s somebody else’s problem and then find themselves in a situation where they themselves can’t produce even PPE that they need. ...And I’ll just apologise for vent and go hide under a table..."

So if they sleep from sunrise to sunset - they would sleep for longer as the light day grows during firs half of the year and then sleep less whe the light day is sorter?

tories,fpu5xsn,t3_gf5675,1588905377.0,"To be honest, I always thought they were this kind of party that are in reality are comfortable with being part of something bigger and don’t really want to take the leading role. 

Imo with all the opportunity they had this last election they had absolutely every chance to shine if they had something to shine with. But it was just the same stuff, amplified, but same. 

I did think at one point that I could consider voting for them just to kind of support the balance of what was going on, so I tuned in a bit more into what they had to say. It was just so inconsistent, and it felt like they tried to be all over the place. Also after being bombarded with piles of exactly the same leaflets daily, topped up with personalised “letter”, I somewhat laid off the idea of having someone in the office who had no idea what they wanted to do."
