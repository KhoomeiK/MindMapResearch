HomeDecorating,evekq63,t3_cjjadg,1564469781.0,"Wall art, rugs, fairy lights and plants. That usually does the trick for me!"
Anxiety,evekmce,t3_c4lt76,1564469681.0,"Wanted to share a few of my tips, that helped me cope with the anxiety (I would usually get it before bed):   
1. Meditation and breathing exercises before bed;  
2. Limited usage of an electronic device. No phone or laptop an hour before bed;   
3. Using a weighted blanket - this really puts me in a calmer mood, I got mine from here: https://bearaby.com/products/the-napper;  
4. I completely quit any drinks with caffeine as it gives me a rush of adrenaline."
Anxiety,es664w0,t3_c530as,1561641530.0,"I can definitely agree that weighted blankets help with anxiety. I got mine from Bearaby - [https://bearaby.com/products/tree-napper.](https://bearaby.com/products/tree-napper.) I think it is a beautiful addition to my interior and I find that the weight really grounds me when I feel anxious (I tend to combine it with a meditation app). It is super soft, breathable so you will never feel like you are too hot. I also try to leave a positive impact on the environment and this one is great because with every blanket purchased Bearaby plants a tree."
AskReddit,es661e0,t3_c2ou2w,1561641456.0,"A weighted blanket! I am a very light sleeper therefore most of the gifts I have received for my birthday were revolving around sleep health. I know for some people, this might not seem special, but it honestly changed my life. I could finally fall asleep quicker and get a better rest at night. I just checked, and the one that I have is from Bearaby (https://bearaby.com/products/tree-napper). Not only it helped me so much it is such a lovely interior peace (I could never find a blanket for myself) purely because I didn't like the design). Not only that, I've just read on their website that when you purchase a blanket the brand plants a tree for it. It just made me so happy!"
HomeDecorating,es65y0t,t3_c5vj62,1561641381.0,"So cute, where did you get it? Would love to have something like that in my kitchen."
WeightedBlankets,es65t3w,t3_bztvs2,1561641273.0,"I personally use ""The Napper"" from Bearaby: [https://bearaby.com/products/the-napper](https://bearaby.com/products/the-napper). This blanket does not have any filling materials inside. Through their layering technique they have incorporated the weight naturally, without using any filling materials. You should give it a try! Plus, it looks beautiful on your bed."
travel,es5wp17,t3_c3hldc,1561632127.0,"I need to recommend you a hotel. There are obviously loads of amazing places to see. But I went to Barcelona this summer and got to live in Casa Bonay. Everything is made by local artists, the overall vibe of this place is super hip and instagram friendly. And the bast part is - they have ""Satan's coffee"" which was hands down the best coffee in Barca. As for the locations - make sure to see Gaudi's architecture (Park Guell was my fav) and go to Boqueria market."
travel,es5wgez,t3_c5p0h2,1561631811.0,Would go back to this place anytime!
HomeDecorating,es5wf9v,t3_c5quay,1561631768.0,House plants and wall art should definitely do the trick!
ethicalfashion,es5w9pl,t3_brdx1a,1561631565.0,"I have recently gifted my friend with a Bearaby weighted blanket. It is made 100% sustainably farmed organic cotton and it really helps her falling asleep faster. I got her the color ""Milky way"" (https://bearaby.com/products/the-napper). And may I say it is a beautiful interior addition! Also, their packaging has 0 plastic, which is a huge plus in my book."
