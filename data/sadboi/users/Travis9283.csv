AskCulinary,ev84mdr,t1_ev83trc,1564269179.0,"Yeah, top round is the same as London broil plus the meat cap.  Both are a very tough meat With low fat content that’s why you don’t see that golden brown sear like you would on a ribeye or a very well marbled fillet.  Usually if I’m cooking a top round or London broil I marinate for 24 hours with my preferred marinade and then I broil it in the oven for seven or eight minutes per side. It may sound a little off but I marinate mine in French dressing After tenderizing meat thoroughly with a spiked tenderizer.   Maybe someone else can chime in on about cooking London broil without an oven. I do not smoke meats a lot.  Perhaps if you do not have an oven you could pick up a cheap sous vide to cook them that way then finish off on a high sear in a pan.

Or you could beat the shit out of it with a meat tenderizer and make some country fried steak."
AskCulinary,ev83jyc,t1_ev82pq0,1564268537.0,"My apologies I thought I read differently, looks like they’re about an inch thick.  Not sure of your location but here generally any cut of steak is about 1 1/4 inch thick up to 2 inches if you were getting a fillet. For reference, a fillet would be heavily seasoned with salt and pepper, again a high heat oil but I would sear that steak for about six minutes without moving or touching it. Then flip it and into the oven for six or seven minutes for a medium to medium rare with a great crust. That type of steak I would definitely let rest for at least 15 minutes under tight foil.  Another good point is to make sure your steak is at room temperature before you start cooking it.

The 2 of the 3 on the left look like top round?"
AskCulinary,ev82gnj,t3_cio1lo,1564268012.0,"Unless I’m firing up the charcoal grill, this is my preferred method for cooking steak.  I usually use a high heat oil like vegetable or canola until it’s smoking. A thin cut like yours I would only sear for a minute to a minute and a half without touching it, then flip it and stick it in a 450° oven for another minute and a half or so. The important part is once the oven is done, transfer the steak to a serving plate and cover tightly with foil to let it rest for five or 10 minutes.  Occasionally I will put a slab of butter right on top of the steak just before I cover it with foil.  Pre-make a Cajun compound butter and try that on top before the foil. My family prefers this method over any other and they devour it."
