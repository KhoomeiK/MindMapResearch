But, like you, afterwards I get frustrated or cry at trivial things and it really sucks. Now, it's hard for me to express myself and nobody believes me when I say I've been depressed and had GAD all throughout school, because I grew up in good circumstances and was always cheerful. I wished I'd just gotten therapy instead of worrying so much about doing well in school :("

There is a queer character in the family (I won’t say who), but I love how it talks about the complexity of being queer and Hispanic. They delve into other topics too like depression, anxiety, sexism, racism, addiction, being gender nonconforming. The writers are all geniuses and I went to the live audience taping this week and was blown away by the sheer talent of the cast and crew.
