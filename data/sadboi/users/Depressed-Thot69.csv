I once had a friend who I confided in with everything and at first she was kinda supportive but then one night I decided that life was a constant disappointment and I wanted to end it all. I texted her saying good bye and I love you and went to get my knife but after a long while of trying to work up the courage I eventually chickened out. So, ofcourse, I texted her to relieve her worries and we talked for a while but then she added that since she can’t help me I should just go do whatever I want to myself which basically means because I wasn’t magically cured she was tired of trying with me. I replied that since it’s such a bother then you don’t have to listen to me and then she said I should just go find a therapist because she can’t be bothered with this all the time. So I blocked her on every social media I had her on and haven’t spoken to her since. Sometimes I wonder if I overreacted but I was hurt in that moment and acted on impulse."
