I'm not one to diagnose this, but I've heard very similar things from a close friend who is also a victim like that. Your mother does sound like she has some narcissistic tendencies, that way of manipulating and guilt tripping you, making you seem like the bad guy. She might not even realize what she is doing, but it is still very wrong to do it to you. You should definitely try to draw that line and try not to let her words have such an impact on you anymore. I know that's way easier said than done, but take small steps. When she says something that sounds absurd to you or something negative that makes you feel bad, leave that situation and don't believe what she says as the truth. Usually there's really no point to try to argue back because these cases are too stubborn to take back their own words or not believe that they could be wrong. 

It seems like you actually answered your own question already. If another year more only makes you more miserable and you do not want to work on that area, why should you waste that year? Past has already happened and you can't change that. What you can change is your future. And trust me, there can be a future outside your mothers vision. Take those new steps if that's what you want. Start living your own life, you still have time :) Life isn't as scary as your mother believes, but it is a struggle. Make it a struggle worth living and find your own happiness :)"

I've also dealt with a helicopter mom though definitely not as bad as yours. But it still left deep scars in me that I've had to work hard to fix. 

Sorry to say this but your mother sounds very toxic.. And you need to escape that and fast. You're already an adult, you have every legal right to decide for yourself what you want to do. Right now it seems like you are living your mothers dreams, not your own. And it also seems like you already have something you'd actually want to do. Go for that! Even if you graduate from that math degree, do you actually want to work in that field? If no, stop wasting your precious life in that school and go do something you actually feel happy to do. This is your own life, not your mothers. Even if she gave birth to you, she still doesn't have any rights to say what you should do with your life. You do.

Parents DON'T know it all, do you realize that? Your mom sounds like she is just spouting anything to keep you from escaping from under her care. She doesn't know how to let you go and that is very difficult to her. But she has to, that is every parents duty for their children. Otherwise she is hindering your growth as an adult. And that is abuse in it's own way. 

I am also battling OCD so I know what your mother is going through. It is VERY difficult for her to change her behaviour, those obsessive thoughts are too loud. But even if she is sick, she does not have any right to let it also ruin your life.  That's where you need to set a line. 
You need to find your own voice, your own confidence. Find yourself. Ignore your mother and go do what makes you happy. That is what every parent should want for their child. I know this all sounds harsh, but that's what you need to be right now.

I know it's hard to move forward, I've been there myself and still am struggling. But you have only two options, change your life for the better or stay where you are right now. Are you happy right now? If not and you'd want to be, then take that first step. Change is always possible, don't stop yourself from getting happiness. 

You are good enough, you always will be. You just have to decide that for yourself. 

You can do this, I believe in you!"
AskReddit,figuaqy,t1_figana4,1582403509.0,"I feel you.. Just lost a long-time friend because I didn´t have enough time for them. Mind you I´m trying to balance having one part time job, running my own part time business and also going to school, all of this in order to finally be able to work just in a few months with a smile on my face. Those gaps in the schedule are literally the only times I have to meet a friend. Then I also have to squeeze in some self-care somewhere.. Never mind taking care of my family :’D It sucks but there’s literally nothing I can do about it.."
