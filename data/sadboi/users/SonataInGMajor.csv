It's difficult for people with astma and respiratory issues to not be treated right now, but it would be even more dangerous to allow them to go to a hospital with extremely contagious patients that carry a disease that could kill them. The focus now is on those suffering and those infected to ensure less infections in the future and to help find a possible instant cure and or a vaccine for COVID-19. It's rough for all other patients, but avoiding the further spreading of the pandemic is what is the priority now, in the eyes of many doctors and healthcare/government officials."
TooAfraidToAsk,fqtevwb,t3_gkuxfn,1589637610.0,"Masochism is a extremely subjective kink. Like how sadism isn't about enjoying ALL pain someone inflicts onto others, masochism is usually about specific pains that differ from person to person. Not every single form of physical pain will arouse a masochist, just like how people aren't attracted to every person that falls into the category of their general type.

Masochism also usually has to do with pain inflicted by a specific partner or group of partners who the masochist trusts and wants to experience receiving pain from."

TooAfraidToAsk,fotzayd,t3_g9hdhu,1588071429.0,"Okay so the second thing is pretty easy to answer, for me at least. If you don't want to have sex with women, you're straight. Dreams are extremely non-sensical and don't always make sense, especially when it comes to relationships and such so I wouldn't read too much into it.  
The first one however is a bit more complicated. Power dynamics in sex and other kinks are a really taboo but very ingrained part of our sexuality and don't per se reflect our rational thoughts and social ideas. Just because someone is into sado masochism doesn't mean someone is an abuser or wants to be in an abusive relationship, or because someone is into being humiliated doesn't mean that they are asking to be harrassed in the street by a stranger. Same goes for rape fantasies; it's an exchange of power from a submissive person lending power to a dominant person. Fantasising and having a desire to act out a consensual dynamic like that doesn't make you someone who approves of a non-consensual dynamic and actual rape. It's not an inherant biological thing but probably a weird mix of socialisation, personal experiences in life and brain wiring. It's okay to have those fantasies and it's okay to want to experiment with them with another consensual person who wants to experiment with it. I really hope this helps and I wish you the best for the future."
