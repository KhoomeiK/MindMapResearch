All the other symptoms you may be experiencing will be categorized in these major issues. Also, Psychiatrist note consistent symptom expression. A Psychiatrist will try to understand , let's say anxiety, as a manifestation from one of the main categories. They might try to map it's cyclical prevalence and also the severity. They really aren't going to help you resolve or improve your anxiety, but are going to try to keep you stabilized so that you don't experience extreme anxiety. Every gets anxious sometimes, and Psychiatrist usually try to keep people baselined.  


If you want help for sub-symptoms, you're better off seeing a Psychologist, Therapist, or a Healthcare professional who specializes in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Some of them can write you scripts for further medication and/or send recommendations to your Psychiatrist."

So, why is that not the case in the States? (Presuming you are from the states)? The consent of the governed.

bipolar,fq6eqnt,t3_gh03tr,1589130100.0,"It depends on your definition of grandiosity. There's nothing wrong with being grandiose or having grandiosity; however, the disconnect is the reality of one's situation. It's the delusion of grandiosity that's the hallmark of the symptom. Imagining you are wealthy, or know celebrities, or are a star athlete, when in reality, you are living a delusion, and you are not those things. Consider an imagination run wild and unable to come back to reality.

Delusion would be that without reason. Even so, some reason can be convincing, enough reason manipulative, but all the same, it's inherently untrue. If you are content and making good strides in your life, then by all means enjoy yourself! Don't think twice you are living under some sort of delusion. Everyone lives in their own delusion, and certainly anxiety begs the question of whether or not you are gauging your reality to the reality of others. You must accept what is true to you as you are. This is the first step in awakening and enlightenment.

Sometimes, a delusional trance help me see past our systematic society. You begin to see programming and scripting. You begin to recognize the things you do and say automatically, and you question how you become this way. What influences you, your decisions. Who controls your time, what you say, what you do. It can be freeing. Freedom of this level can causes serious depression and anxiety, and of course, it can cause mania and psychosis. 

The danger is believing your awakening is linked to some grandiose delusion. That you are destined to be this or do that or something. Sure, that's great and all, but until you are inspired into action and a rational plan to achieve this goal, you've got to set realistic expectations.

In short, if you tell anyone you are GOING to be extraordinary, you'd better back it up and/or be on your way to achieving your destiny. Otherwise, people are going to think you are a lunatic. Furthermore, if you destroy your life chasing your dream, this is deemed to be grandiose, delusional, ecetera. One prime example, to the contrary, was Nicholas Tesla. Dude was probably Schioaffective. He was absolutely crazy. He was  Mad scientist. He was Brilliant, a Genius, Artistic. He gave the world 100s of inventions that we all use today. The telephone, the radio, on and on. He was notorious for not eating food, staying up for days on end, and was very much isolated with no social life. I'd say he had his own awakening, and never gave up on being who he was.

So what do you do with your awakening? Well, I'll tell you to be cautious about who you tell, about what you are doing, and to stay focused on making your dream a reality. There will be millions of people, average people, people with no dreams, no hopes, only fears, who are going to tell you that its' not possible and question your sanity.

It's just a shame that our society has decided aspirations and creative genius are not longer worthy of recognition. Instead, they medicate, indoctrinate, and ostracize anyone that doesn't 'get with the program'."

After I got out, we tried to maintain the relationship, but I was too broken to function. I needed to repair the damage done before I could focus on another person. It wasn't fair to her, trying to keep her captive, when clearly, I was in desperate need of recovery.

ExperiencedDevs,fpkc1yw,t1_fpk032z,1588691934.0,"Indeed, it can be difficult to have a conversation across threads, especially when we've now expanded topics of discourse.   


We've also approach the conversation from different perspectives and different roles. If I were to approach you from an entrepreneurial standpoint, I would share different opinions on things such as global competition. The truth is, I'm not a 'software developer'. I'm a Computer Scientist. Developing software is not that difficult of a task, I'd wager it's the easiest part of Computer Science. It's the fruit of the labor.  


Now, one of my friends is a software developer. He got a certificate from an imaginary school where he trained to write software. As such, I matched his compensation on the very 1st day of my employment, even though he had a year of education and five years of experience. Why is that the case? Well, let me give you an example of a mutual friend.  


I partnered with a mutual friend,who also went to the same imaginary school, and asked him to come onboard as a FE dev. I showed him the proposal and the hourly rate I had requested for FE dev hours. He said it was a fair amount, something like 20/25$ an hour or so. I got the BE and website live in about a day or two and then turned to assisting him on the FE. One day, he was over in the home studio and was struggling to get some jQuery running. He had spent about 4 hours or so trying to get a few features running, but  he just couldn't fine tune the code. So, I took a look, took control of the wheel, and in about 5-10 minutes I had every feature up and running on the website. He looked up at me and just said 'You did what took me days in a matter of minutes, you don't even need me', to which I graciously encouraged him and welcomed his company and assistance on the project. All the same, why was I able to do what he could not?

It's very simple. I have a degree in Professional Computer Science from a United States University, from an Accredited College of Basic and Applied Sciences. That's why I am compensated heavily. It has nothing to do with some bloke in another country that probably went to imaginary school. It also doesn't have much to do with the economy more so over as the technical revolution unfolding. I studied government research back in 2005/2006. I knew that this field would pay well, and I knew how this field would grow. You've got to be pretty smug to think that \*your\* prediction of salaries in the US is going to be more accurate than 1,000s of researchers.  


I'd love to tell you the story of my 1st employer, they are ranked in the top 10 in the UK, you've probably heard of them. Essentially, a PM took my ambition and eagerness to learn, and leveraged my ability to get the slackers in line. As a contractor, they kept extending my contract b/c it was a 50/50 split between the talking heads on whether to bring me on as an employee. My PM, loved the guy, loved working with me b/c I had ambition and could do the work of 4-5 people. Those 4-5 people did not like me, because the PM would send me directly to them to 'help' them get the job done. Now, do I mind what he did? No. I learned an un-Godly amount of practical knowledge, and the experience is nothing like I've seen since. All the same, had I more experience, I would have known to tread carefully and not step on toes. I was a great team player in the eyes of the PM and a few Senior SEs, but to the lower ranks, I was competition and trying to take their jobs. People got defensive. I eventually had to walk away from the company. Remember, this was my first job, so I had no idea what politics were being played. Essentially, I showed how fast my draw was and should have focused on get more work for ME to do, instead of allowing someone to point my gun at other people.

ExperiencedDevs,fpghlwr,t1_fpdv2aw,1588602867.0,"When I was in college, a friend asked me, ""Would you program for $15 an hour, $10 an hour""? I told her I would rather be unemployed. She was shocked that I didn't say I would code for nothing.

I further went to explain to my friend that I would rather be a landscaper than program for nothing. Why is that? I love landscaping. I love the smell of grass, the sound of clipping, the adventure of climbing trees, transforming and creating a picture perfect scene. I am more skilled at landscaping than I am at programming (mind you, these were college days).

A past landscaping client of mine, started me off slowly. First, just fix the lawn. We agreed on a price beforehand. He was an Old School New Yorker, and he could give two shits about my attitude or my skill level. He expected the job to be done. At a minimum, he expected me to be cordial and respectful around his property. After a few sessions and building enough trust, he allowed me to do the bushes, the trees, the walkways, the planting, and so on. He'd ask for advice and we would rarely haggle on the price, but he knew my skills and attention to detail. Eventually, he allowed me to work on his prized Crepe Myrtles and Roses. He trusted my word, and knew that the price I requested was based not only on my skill, but also my thoughtfulness and vision for his property. He trusted my integrity, and he praised me for my good work. Before long, it was more than a job, it was a masterpiece. To this day, I am quite proud of what was done with his property. He was quite saddened when I told him I was off to school for Computer Science, because he knew it'd be hard to find someone that loved doing what I did. My skill transformed work into art, and I was heavily rewarded.

The moral of the story is this. Compensation, Skill, Reward, Vision. I don't really understand what 'attitude' is your #1. Would you really hire people that had attitude problems?

We used to call these people seers. Now, we just call em nuts. :( great times in which we live.

It's a real shame too. One time, I heard a motorcycle from about a mile away, went into a trance, and saw my neighbors kids being run over by the motor cycle. I was standing in the kitchen with my Mom. I dropped what I was holding; sprinted through the house and out the front door; screamed get out of the street, just as the jackass driver spun around the corner doing about 75, probably 100 feet from the kids, half of which were autistic.

This is not the first time things like this have happened, but it's just an example of how extreme paranoia and hallucination can actually be beneficial to society.

Ding ding ding. We have a winner here folks. If you have Bipolar Disorder, you should NOT be taking this medication without a mood stabilizer. I hate when Neurologists do this to people. It's complete irresponsible. She should of taken you off the medication when you experienced heightened side effects.

You should not be taking an antidepressant for headaches. Jesus Christ, at least ask your Doctor about taking Sumatripitan for your headaches. Hell, even Excedrin goes a long way.

I was prescribed something similar for my migraine headaches. It led me to becoming psychotic and in a hospital for two weeks, along with a diagnosis of Bipolar Type I.

Not sure she disclosed this to you, but you are taking an SSRI (antidepressant). This medication is NOT approved by the FDA for the treatment of migraine headaches."

Whether or not you take the medication, you need to see a therapist and work on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, with a focus on remaining present and centered. I've free-flowed a number of thoughts below. Feel free to pick my brain. I'm happy to discuss dissociation with you. I take lithium, which is similar to depakote. I also take other things. I've also taken nothing. All the same, you will find more answers through education than medication, and more medication through education. :)

Blue pill Red pill. You can educate yourself about the world you live in or just medicate yourself out of it. Dissociation in modern times is largely due in part to the way in which human society has become disjunctive to the state of the natural world. We do not live in a natural world anymore. It's artificial. It's logical. The world around you is designed by a system. Every single thing you see, hear, read, have been programmed by people. People set out to influence you. Influence what you do, where you do it, why you do it, and for whom you will be doing it.

The world does not make sense to anyone that still has a mind to see it. What you've encountered, is systems that are in design and not fully complete. You drive to a dead end road on the end of town. Why did the road stop? Where are the street lights, the buildings, why is nothing here. Why am I here? I shouldn't be here. There is nothing here. But no, that is where everything is. That's where reality is. But we've been programmed that society is where reality is, and thats where you belong to be.

You are in a building. You enter an empty floor. The lights are barely on. It's just you. You are alone now. No sounds, just creeks in the floor. Silence. You here your breathe, your footsteps. You are in a building. No grass, trees, bugs. No life. You feel out of place. But you know people are in the building, other floors with lights. Other sounds. You are scared. You are in a reality, but the system is empty. You are alone.

You visit an area of town. you haven't been here in years. There's new buildings. new streets. new signs. this cant be real. you were just here, all of this was built so fast. but it was years and years ago. time stands still. what happened. where did you go. you didn't see the system build this. time passed you by. you don't belong anymore.

You hang out with your friends. you've been home for months now. the group has new jokes, new stories. you weren't a part of it. you find it hard to relate. you imagine yourself not part of the group. do you belong any more. are you even their friend. they don't remember you. why weren't you there. you don't exist with them anymore.

The rain wont stop. its been raining for days. you see a thousand raindrops. hear a whisper in your ear. the wind is whispering. but its saying nothing. you are merging into the rain. becoming part of its echo. you've lost who you are with each passing moment. a thousand futures pass before your eyes.

You've zoned out again. Your friend has caught you again. you just cant focus on the present. your mind is wandering. you don't feel like they even know you. but you don' t know yourself. you are a friend. you are supposed to go out with this person and do things. this is where you are supposed to be. are you even supposed to be here.

Do you hate being alone without human contact, or do you feel that you don't belong to enough groups? Everyone has time to spend alone, but perhaps you are spending too much time alone?
