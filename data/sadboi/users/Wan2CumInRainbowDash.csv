His Medicaid Redesign Team (MRT) is proposing a $2.5 Billion cut to the program (including $400 Million to hospitals) as opposed to tax increases on New York's %0.01, which is wildly popular among the state's democrats and republicans. 

What's even worse is that this budget cut means that the state is no longer able to receive $6.7 Billion in federal aid, meaning he is effectively blocking $9 Billion towards the Medicaid program--in the middle of a pandemic!

Furthermore, 5G uses much higher frequencies than 2G, 3G, or 4G (60,000 MHz compared to 700-2,700 MHz respectively). These higher frequencies, called millimeter waves, are likely to penetrate the body no deeper than the skin whereas lower frequencies have been shown to penetrate 3-4 inches into the human body. 

5G is probably *less* likely to harm us than previous technologies, which might not harm us at all to begin with."
