I've experimented with acid for about 7 years, I even got to the point I would micro-dose once a week or so. Let's just say I was ""tripping"" weekly for awhile so facinated with this world it was showing me and the ability to step outside of myself to tackle my internal battles. From long time use of acid I do believe I developed an inability to regulate my emotions, more paranoid thoughts, and I lost some ability to be happy without them. 

Appreciate them for the doors they may open but understand they're not eternal truth. I've honestly put myself into intense meditation practicing Kundalini yoga I've gone places no acid trip will ever take me.

My mom is 55 years old and a two time cancer survivor, she's been working at Walmart through this pandemic. If she's gotta do it I gotta do it. Different people were raised with different work ethics. We didn't get unemployment offered, I've been out of work for two months with no income. If I can be the one that takes the extra steps to keep things clean & my company literally pays us to come in whenever we want to clean. And we are required to reclean popular touch points with bleach every 10 minutes. We only allow patrons to sit on our patio outside and the tables are empty nothing to grab nothing to touch. My risk is ultimately very low and I do not live with anyone to spread this too. If anything I should be the one working to help keep the country and small businesses moving along. If anything it's a sacrifice I'm willing to give. People also are making their own decisions to come out and eat no one can hold their hand and tell them what to do. I really do believe the risk is not as severe as it was before. I will not regret this, if anything all it's teaching me is resilience. Times are tough and uncertain but I think we're going to pull through this relatively soon. 

Things seemed a lot scarier when I was home reading the news every day.

This was when I was 12 or 13. All of this is just speculation but when I was inflicting pain onto myself physically, through substances or even my mindset astral projection was never fun.

Codependency,fqnjpp7,t3_gjw93n,1589496078.0,"Yes. This resonates with me deeply. When I was younger I had some frustrating sexual experiences, I felt that I was even encouraged to explore unattached emotionless sexual experiences. I fell into the needs myth that men needed sex and women were there to please them. I had sex with people I didn't want to or people I didn't care for because I believed in this expectation that I had to play submissive & if I led them on then I had to finish the act. Maybe it was out of a deeper desire for love or the part of me that was starved emotional intimacy as a child. I think I looked for it in pleasing men. It traveled into my relationships, I felt that if I was interested in someone I had to have sex with them right away & sometimes I got into relationships purely because of the bond that came with the sexual intimacy with these partners never from an emotional depth. 

Recently I've even caught myself scared to go over to a man's house because I'm scared he will get upset if I don't have sex with him. Even though this isn't necessarily true it's a condition of my choices. Right now I'm really focusing on abstinence I'm reading literature about sexual wisdom and what really constitutes as good sex. The majority agree sex needs to be an act of love something to bond you closer to your partner it was never about pleasure or the ""needs"" myth (that men or anyone needs sex). I want to experience love before I give myself to someone and I'm going to hold off because the right person will respect my morals and wait for me. 

I do believe a lot of us confuse sexual intimacy with emotional intimacy."

They were not testing anyone at that time. I found Kundalini yoga during this time. I did tons of breathwork which I think kicked the cold quicker then it could've been. 

The yoga helped me strength my immune system and build up my lung capacity. One of the breaths that really helped was taking a long deep breath starting at the base of your spine make sure your solar plexus is extended I would hold that breath as long as I could until I was light headed or in some discomfort the expell the breath all the way pull your stomach all the way in and keep breathing out until you low key feel like you're gonna faint. Keep doing those breaths over and over it builds up your lungs. 

Another one I did was breath of fire a very fast paced breathing that wakens up your immune system. Look up Kundalini yoga they have creas for viruses, respiratory systems and much more. 

The most ancient form of yoga 

I also did tons of cardio too the more I felt the fight in my body the better I felt. Get moving get breathing. 

I'm also asthmatic so I was on powder steroid inhalants, they loaded me up with predinozone as well. I was on so many steroids and they didn't treat my symptoms which has led me to believe that I did suffer from COVID. The last doctor I saw before my symptoms went away said he couldnt deny that I had it but that with my age and severity of symptoms I'll be fine and recover soon.

Empaths,fqfrh9z,t1_fqfmd9p,1589330263.0,"There's just a negative stigma with BPD but when you have it your impulses are almost impossible to control, you have paranoia, dissociation spells, constant agony, fear of abandonment and some other things that make it difficult to be happy. It's relative over time and requires constant work to maintain or you relapse. People really have BPD & can function in society without screaming ""female pyschopath"". I get your claim that we shouldn't label people. But BPD is a debilitating personality disorder that needs to be destigmatized and properly educated to people. Cause when you have BPD you feel like no one will ever understand your pain. And the internet is a horrible outlet for research for anyone that suffers from it."
Empaths,fqfqxo5,t3_gikxxy,1589329965.0,"I'm borderline too... 

You can control your mood swings, and you can control your impulses. It does not take away from your power of being an empath. It can make it more difficult to manage intense emotions because it will be harder to decipher which ones are truly yours. 

When you look inward at your impulsive behaviors you will see some things you won't like. You will have to take accountability even though you're pain is more of an agony. You will also have to understand that because we are borderline we cannot use any mood altering substances it might disregulate your mood or cause your paranoia to consume you. 

Borderlines have an amazing power of emotional depth a lot of people don't understand. See that power for the good it can be! Harness it ! First you need to take a long look in the mirror find your triggers and patterns of emotional irrationality. 

DBT changed my life. Yoga and meditation really helped me decipher between what feelings were mine and what was mere paranoia or negative energy I picked up elsewhere. 

Stock your cabinet full of friends that have high values and goals. People that can handle your emotional outbursts without judging you. When you have secure people in your life it's easier to listen to your intentions.

Ground yourself constantly. You have to do this more often because of the BPD. You need to root yourself to the energy of the Earth and learn how to control your racing thoughts of darkness. You need to practice mindfulness so when you feel an urge or sensation you can stop retreat back to the present moment and let it go.

Borderline is not a limitation. We were brought here with our conscious in two different worlds, we were exposed to feelings and energies we weren't prepared for. I look at my BPD diagnosis as a mission for mindfulness. I have to work a little harder and focus tons of attention on self reflection and self progression. I can't take breaks, I cannot use any mind altering substance, and I have to practice self love more often. 

Be aware of the things you do that harm others emotionally. Our emotions are too much for the average person to handle. Especially when you add the empath factor. You can self soothe and heal you're own soul without draining your friends. 

Counseling and DBT are a necessity in my life so I do not drain others around me with my intense emotions. 

It does get easier if you look inward ask your higher self for guidance and put the work in. 

Also please look into hypnosis healing. My favorite ones to watch are on YouTube [Guided Healing Hypnosis](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLs4IKoo9ByJ3IQS6u0pRRw)

I want you to know that you have all of the power you need to overcome the darkness BPD can make us feel.

Me too. I've been off Facebook for over two years and I just recently deleted Instagram & Snapchat. The original use of those apps has now been twisted into a huge marketing, make yourself feel less then you should, privacy abuse, and time wasted. 

I downloaded Instagram again today I went on it for two seconds to read my dms and decided it has no value to my personal or spiritual growth. We do not know the long term physiological affects of social media. 

The values of social networking has evolved into negative views and beliefs about the world. It leads the the over abundance of fake news, false claims, and false advertising. 

It is unethical in hindsight.

They steal our ""private data"" with no remorse use and sell it to advertisers. 

We will be better off from abstaining from the instant gratification of social media, we will develop closer human bonds, and come up with more ideas and beliefs that are from our own intuition then what we've accidentally subconsciously absorbed. 

I hope more people start to see the negative trend social media has on your spirit.

changemyview,fqbze9a,t3_ghxuu5,1589246962.0,"There are other crimes that are non violent that are still heinous. 

But how about we change the context of what you wrote. 

People who commit drug crimes are essentially addicts (unless their sole purpose was the sale and resell of narcotics). I have had this belief for a while and I truly believe we should not imprison people charged with the use of narcotics instead issue a mandatory rehabilitation period. If we have holding facilities for solely drug addicts that use methods to detox and rehabilitate these people all while finding the root cause of their addiction. This would be more effective. If we stop giving drug addicts felony charges and instead demand they seek treatment we would have a huge reduction in repeat offenders. Plus so many people would be encouraged for sobriety. 

Maybe have a three strike rule before you give them a felony and send them to prison. People would still try to cheat the system but overall I do believe it would have a positive impact reduce the amount of drug users and repeat offenders. They'll also have more opportunities to seek better employment without a felony drug charge. 

Addicts are usually addicts because of other psychological conditions or unresolved trauma. It is my dream that some day we rehabilitate and release I would love to see a world full of recovering addicts loving their life's again.

I think we all struggle with this to a certain extent I realized that sex is such a spiritual connection and I started to feel drained from our current hookup culture (all selfish desires) sex should be an act of love. Sometimes it takes time and patience to see that you love someone. Sex is there to consomate that love. The book Sexual Wisdom even talks about how artificial birth control encourages riskier sexual behavior because we don't really look at pregnancy as a risk anymore so we're more likely to give into the ""needs"" myth. 

I've also realized the intensity and enjoyment of sex is unmeasurable when you're doing it in the name of love. So many ancient books mention that the goal of sex isn't climaxing it's the bond you create with that person."

His points are backed by factual information and he has tons of references. I never thought I'd agree with such views but his main point is sex should come from love. We need to have love before we have sex. No one has a need to have sex and it can be controlled. 


[Sexual Wisdom ](https://www.amazon.com/Sexual-Wisdom-Parents-Educators-Physicians/dp/0979540208)

This book takes a very spiritual ancient view on sex and using our higher chakras for transference of energy. It talks about man not being able to control his animalistic desires and how that over time has been a detriment to society. These are amazing books that reveal a different view on sex then society does. 

[Compilation of Sex ](https://www.amazon.com/Compilation-Sex-Alice-Bailey/dp/0853301360)


We don't need to have sex. I don't have to lay down and please a man because he has needs. Women and men have twisted views on sexuality. Let's savor it, embrace love, and transmute our energy to higher dimensions.

Other people he talked to we're all transactional he never took them seriously and talked shit about them frequently. He did have one best friend an extremely empathetic one."

Empaths,fpw3voz,t1_fpvi679,1588956805.0,Especially female empaths since we cycle with the moon. My menstrual cycle has been synchronized with the full or new moon my whole life. Lemme tell you it is hard to manage emotions around those times.
Empaths,fpw3rbs,t3_gfsml1,1588956745.0,Hm weird woke up today and felt like the air was thicker. Also I have mild asthma sooo it could just be that. But I do feel like a weight is on my chest a very small weight.
AstralProjection,fpp5f1v,t3_gefzgf,1588796274.0,I started to imagine myself walking down stairs and tell myself I will fall deeper into relaxation after every step I take. It worked the other day but I got too excited and couldn't leave my body. It was like I was floating above falling into floating above falling back in.
AstralProjection,fpp5583,t3_geo67e,1588796139.0,"Yup that's how it starts. Exactly what you explained. I've been accidentally APing since I was 12. I thought I was possessed at one time and even went to my religious family to pray the demons out of me...... Not a joke. No one understood these vibrations. They felt like seizures sometimes I would hear voices or the vibrations became extremely erotic and it terrified me. Anytime they would happen I used all the force in my body to try to wake up or fight them off. Eventually I would wake up. 


You have to fall into them. You cannot fear them, you have to relax and you will AP successfully. Try not to get too excited now when they happen I'm super stoked and my excitement pulls me back into my body. 

Don't fear them. Research them."

BPD,fpmyyeo,t3_geb5d2,1588745412.0,Validation that's pretty much what we're always searching for. Validate that you understand her pain but the way she is coping with her pain hurts you. Express empathy ask for empathy.
HumansBeingBros,fpmuh12,t1_fpl1qyp,1588742055.0,Yes hospitals are pretty much empty in Phoenix. Heard from a nurse friend that some of the hospitals might have to lay off nurses there's not enough revenue coming in. They started allowing elective surgeries again which will help.

AstralProjection,fpel2as,t3_gcto3s,1588549616.0,"Yes same exact thing started happening to me around 12. They stopped when I was struggling with addiction. Same thing happened when I got sober. Now I can get out of my body a little more I leaned that I can't be overly excited or ""try"" too hard. I think it's all about relaxations. I've seen the entities too, I think they might be a cause of fear. You can't fear anything, you have to know you're safe. Ask your guides to travel with you."
talesfromcallcenters,fpbdvn0,t1_fpbdjuh,1588467759.0,Eh you're limiting yourself. I worked for this company for 9 months I was contract to hire for 6 of those months. I was 19 years old applied for a job as a training lead which was a pretty big position in that company. Everyone else that applied had been there for 5+ years and I got the job. You can do it but if you don't try you'll be stuck where you are.
spirituality,fpbdmlx,t3_gcdzhl,1588467599.0,"Well pyschotic isn't actually a diagnosis.. I struggle with some mental health issues and I actively pursue therapy. I was diagnosed with BPD and you know it does resonate with me. I know I'm an empath, I have vivid dreams, and night terrors, I see things others don't. I'm hyper emotional and still don't know how to regulate my emotions. Sometimes I'm vulnerable to paranoid delusions. I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders it gets intense. I don't think anyone is truly pyschotic, I do believe that you can get to a place so distant from reality you might not come back. A lot of pyschosis can be caused by drug addictions and overuse of pychadellics. I myself have experienced severe paranoia from an overuse of pychadellics. I'm literally labeled a ""female pyschopath"" by a large portion of the world. Does that take away from my spirituality? My will to learn how to control my mind? Do not let paranoia control you, the more you try to conspiracise things the further down the rabbit hole you're going to get. The answers to life, love, and oneness are far simpler then they seem. Find your true self look inward, don't oppose therapy, it honestly helps those who truly need it. For me the SSRI's and antipsychotics took away my memories and dreams. I didn't want to be on them. Some people do need them. Not everything is good or evil. You gotta stay away from that black and white thinking. If you find yourself questioning your reality it's time to do some inner work and heal yourself. You can heal the mind without drugs."
talesfromcallcenters,fpbbxc6,t3_gcgrk2,1588466530.0,"I felt the same way. I worked in call centers starting at 18. The only position I loved was being a training TL best damn job of my life. Look at the phones like it's a step up, the only people that don't hate their jobs get off the phones. I recently tried to work for a new company cough cough Carvana they did a mass 120 person hire every 4 weeks and had a mandatory OT of 10 hours every week, split days off, but great benefits. Tbh it wasn't worth the detriment it did to my soul. I fucking hated it. I honestly burned out in under two months, spiraled into a dark cloud of depression. I quit started cocktail serving and for awhile I was making as much money in one week serving drinks then I did in a two week paycheck from Carvana. But now I'm jobless because of that decision well more because of COVID . Do I regret it ? Hell no. What's my advice to you. Apply for more positions at your company and get off the phones!!! Get off the phones, you can ride the ladder of call center operations without being on the phones. Apply for the job you thought you weren't qualified for.  You'll be surprised at how much growth you can achieve."
BPD,fp909u3,t3_gc2nan,1588409381.0,"Hey i feel just like you do. Im only 22 and social media puts a real downer on my mental health. I deleted Facebook years ago after the plethora of fake news during the last election. It didn't resonate with me, Facebook is no longer about keeping connections with people, it's all advertising and propaganda. I just deleted my Instagram and Snapchat because it doesn't fit with my values. It makes me sad, lonely, and critical of myself. 

There are plenty of positive social media sites you can spend your time on like Reddit and YouTube to keep you busy and help with the boredom. Let's do it together. We know it's better for us. Monitor what you allow yourself to view especially with the COVID stuff. My mother really let's it get to her and all I want is for her to get off Facebook and stop worrying. We can't do anything about it so why not give ourselves everything we need to have a better mindset and if getting off Facebook is gonna do that for you. I know you can push through and do it! You'll feel so much better when you do."
Empaths,fp8xcyz,t3_gc2kig,1588406320.0,"I feel your grief, I recognize your anger, I hear your questions. Death is not the end. It's an unexpected phenomena that doesn't give us much warning before it takes our loves ones away. Maybe even someone we only knew shortly put their passing stings a small hole into our hearts growing every day without them. We will never know why, we can allow ourselves to grieve in whatever way we might need in the moment. Remember that death is not the end. They can hear you, they're always there. I know this might not be what you're looking for. I feel your pain & sorrow. Please do not feel guilty, our sorce knows more then we do. Nothing was in your control, allow yourself the space and time to grieve."
NarcissisticAbuse,fp8ogsw,t1_fp8o9pu,1588397959.0,"It's crazy to hear others stories and find out someone somewhere went through the same mental agony you did. All we can do now is break free, notice the red flags next time and not ignore them. It's been three months for me. He has tried to swoon me occasionally only to discard me all over again. Be strong babe please please please don't go back."
NarcissisticAbuse,fp8o6xv,t3_gbq06c,1588397731.0,"You took the words out of my mouth. Going through something like this is so difficult and I feel like so many of the people in our lives judge us and do not understand the agony. I'm with you, I feel just like you do. Maybe we can find solace in knowing we aren't alone. We link together as survivors raise our energy together, form a force field of love and maybe we'll never feel so worthless or unloved again it will keep us from falling into the arms of a beautiful monster."
NarcissisticAbuse,fp8jzbe,t1_fp848aw,1588394310.0,I actually got diagnosed with BPD after attempting suicide which he actually told me to do. If he would've just answered the call or not told me to go through with it I probably wouldn't have. Ive actually heard a lot of victims show traits of BPD but it's more from the mental anguish and torture the narc puts you through.
NarcissisticAbuse,fp8jsqy,t3_gbrll9,1588394169.0,"Lmao they say you're not supposed to do it. I'm a petty person when someone wrongs me. He used me, he abused me, I lost my job because of him. I lost a group of friends. He emotional dragged me to suicide. He dragged me behind his car and never once turned around to see if I was okay. He gaslighted me into believing I deserved it. I told him he had a cold bed in hell. I sent him videos, articles and anything that resonated with me online. I tried to tear his soul into a million pieces. Saying this is what you are ! I caught you! I know what you did. 


Listen babe it doesn't help you. It gives them more ammo to use for their next victim. They'll never truly care, maybe they might for a second but they'll supress it until it becomes a compliment to them. They don't love, value, or appreciate you they way you deserve to be. The best thing you can do is stay away. I've learned my lesson trying to fight for justice it only hurt me more. 

This is my new mantra: every day away I will become stronger and happier. Every day away I will become stronger and happier."
BPD,fp8igmy,t1_fp8hc6n,1588393149.0,Hehehe I love ur comment really got me laughing

AstralProjection,fp6dsdi,t3_gbi8ny,1588350608.0,"Idk but it's been happening to me my whole life since I was 8 or 9 I never tried to project. I had to figure out what it was on my own. It can be a mystifying, terrifying realm. I started reading books written by Robert Monroe. I also try to let go of control and let go of fear. Try to relax into it more. Don't get scared. Sometimes your fear is the only thing holding you back. It's still hard for me to do on command but I can stay out there a little longer each time. Ask your guides for help."
BPD,fp4zimm,t3_gbcaem,1588311653.0,"We all love people that treat us like shit. How do you get someone to love you? Well here's the answer you didn't want to hear. You don't. Love is tricky. True love is not a burning fire of passion, it's not something you have to fight to hold on to. It's not something you mourn the thought of at night when you're alone. It's a weird realm of acceptance, loving someone for who they are. Seeing their flaws, but also seeing them work on their flaws and parading them on their way. It's when you love yourself so much you can share the love you have for yourself with another. 

I'm only 22 but looking for love has landed me in the arms of several abusers. When you have BPD you're heart is the size of the moon and so many people out there have a heart the size of a swimming pool. Sometimes you forget that there are so many people around you that truly show you love you loose yourself in the feeling of not having enough. When you have enough love within and you slowly start to realize that your friends have been loving you this whole time you'll attract the right person in due time. 

I've been in love with my best friend for 5 years dated on and off. Emersed in the pain of rejection, dated other people, explored other avenues. Something keeps pulling me back to him. The only man that ever told me he loves me. Our relationship is not firey and passionate. He makes my heart, body and soul ignite with the slightest touch of his hand. But there is no strain, no drama, no extreme highs. It's simple. We communicate, we value 100% honesty, we see the flaws in one another and have sat and waited for the other to overcome those. It's not romantically beautiful, it's not perfect, he doesn't make me melt, he doesn't make me feel agony. He makes me happy, he loves me for me, he tells me when I hurt his feelings, he lets me go when I need to run, he picks me back up from every abusive relationship I've left him for, he has patience. When looking for a love a deep love take your feelings out of it and focus on your values. 

What do you value in your life? What matters to you? Find someone that shares those values. Find someone that is always excited to see you. Love is a collective work of art that takes two souls working together to make it beautiful."
NarcissisticAbuse,fp4ptuv,t3_gb6qn2,1588304454.0,"Yes I met him when I was leaving the brinks of a hellish depression. I was trying again, nervous, but I was ready to have connections and friendships. I was struggling with PTSD from previous sexual abuse and abusive relationships. He made me believe he was going to be the man that was different. I thought he was safe and that all of the abuse I've previously endured was all for him. Multiple red flags in the beginning the love bombing got to me. Made me feel special, loved. He saw the girl screaming for help inside and used it for his own personal gain."
NarcissisticAbuse,fp0m731,t3_gai0aq,1588212084.0,"Please leave, please save yourself. The emotional starvation does an immense amount of damage on you.

BPD,fp00r5t,t3_gajfd8,1588200329.0,"I think you found a lot of insight in yourself. I think a lot of us, believe that if we aren't in the extremes of emotions we aren't happy or we're numb to everything. Everyone talks about riding the middle path between extremes that's what it sounds like you're doing. You're right if no one is going to listen to you crying why even cry. You can heal yourself you can cry alone and release everything you need to. I constantly use other people as my sounding board and I've exhausted most relationships in my life because I am so uncomfortable with my emotions. You sound like you're getting somewhere I don't necessarily think it's a bad place."
BPD,fp00ezl,t1_fozt2aj,1588200149.0,"Thank you. You told me everything I needed to hear. Recovering from addiction was easier then this.
