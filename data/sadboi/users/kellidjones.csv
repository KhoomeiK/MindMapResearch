ptsd,f1xoxyo,t3_db1slq,1569801673.0,I used to do this when my symptoms of PTSD were worse. Since healing more I look forward to who I am becoming and love who I am. I do transcendental meditation and it's helped me heal so much. Let me know if you want some information on it. Sending you love and light. <3

ptsd,ez2l3q8,t3_cztm2i,1567656428.0,"I know it's hard not to take it personal, but there are so many myths out there about PTSD and mental illness. It's hard for some people to show empathy because they've never been exposed to it and obviously don't suffer from its often debilitating effects. Don't worry about those people. You got this! I can relate to how you feel right not. I don't listen to 'shoulds' anymore. You take care of you. They can do the same. <3 <3

I am a female veteran and have PTSD from non-combat related incident. Add that to family stuff and issues after. You're right. It is the same in some ways...just different triggers, nightmares and flashbacks perhaps. So many myths.

Veterans,exx446l,t3_cuj64h,1566629876.0,"It hurts to hear you're struggling. I tried just about everything since I got out. Meds, therapy, fitness, biofeedback, mindfulness and transcendental meditation (TM). TM is the one therapy that's helped me find balance the past year year, enough to graduate college and now launch my own company. Prior to this, I suffered from chronic  depression, SI and symptoms of PTSD. I recommend applying for Voc Rehab for starters and going to VA therapy to document your experience. The new evidence you need comes from notes from doctors visits and the appointment that comes after your claim is in. Document everything. Please don't lose hope. You are smart and capable. You can do this. [bootcampaign.org](https://bootcampaign.org) has programs to help with PTSD and TBI."
Veterans,exl078x,t3_ct257k,1566403100.0,"I was just talking about this a few days ago. Every few visits it feels like I am getting a new resident and have to tell my whole story again. It lead to misdiagnosed conditions. I had to go to a civilian neurologist ""brain doctor"" to get more info. I also feel worse about myself when I leave the mental health clinic. The way they look at me is uncomfortable as they analyze. If they stayed longer than a few months I would feel comfortable with them and they could really help. I'm sorry you are going through this but I have realized this is a major problem at the VA. It needs to be addressed! Thank you for sharing."

Feminism,exjtica,t3_csz9og,1566359974.0,"I have social anxiety, too. I've noticed it's gotten easier as aged and learned to set boundaries with men. I used to feel rude if I didn't act 'nice' to them when they said or did things that made me uncomfortable. I would smile and nervous laugh. It's true sometimes it's best not to make a scene but men don't always respond to women ignoring their advances. You may need to have a little chat with this guy. I wrote a piece on this yesterday that I hope you will read. I talk about the book ""The Gift of Fear"" in which the author explains about how women's fear in society of being seen as ""rude"" can get us into trouble. I know it has me. It's not our fault. It's how we've been conditioned. I'm learning to use my intuition in situations like yours. You have social anxiety but he could also have ulterior motive. Please be safe and put your safety before feeling pressured to be nice to him or 'smile more.' I am here if you would like to chat about it.

Veterans,ewvgjrx,t3_cqcakc,1565805754.0,It's a struggle to find steady care due to quick rotation schedules of resident physicians at many VAs. Sometime vets are required to tell their story from beginning to end multiple times every year or few years. It can be challenging and lead to different or wrong diagnosis as each new doctor tries to get to know or understand the patients.
Veterans,ewtg35k,t3_cpzrss,1565744365.0,I don't believe you can get the benefits back but look into Voc Rehab if you have disability rating. Helped me finish my BA.

Veterans,ewnjrc9,t1_ewmlj86,1565580285.0,I'm sure most of our exes have something to say. You will figure it out! If you are in LA and would like information for a therapy that has changed my life let me know! I can get you the veteran scholarship to learn through the David Lynch Foundation. The one therapy that has healed me and helped balance me and find more joy. :) LMK. Good luck!
Veterans,ewneqjw,t3_cp4wuw,1565576180.0,We all slip up and displace anger at times but the fact you can say that or acknowledge shows you are on the right path. Proud of you...hard to take the important first step to set that appointment. I journal a lot to put my emotions into words. Hope this helps but you're not alone! : )
Veterans,ewmlj86,t3_cp0bve,1565554563.0,"Give yourself more credit. :)  Some may not agree but if you can spend 13 years in the military then you are smarter than you think. I think we all feel lost at times and I definitely spent a good 6-7 years searching after I got out.  But it gets easier. You are smart, but maybe not at everything which is OK. Just gotta find your passion and run with what you're good at...I recently graduated with my BA from CSUN in LA using Voc Rehab. Took me a L-O-N-G time (lol) but i finally did it after getting into therapy and learning to meditate...transcendental meditation (TM). I say this with the best intentions, but please don't call yourself stupid. <3"
