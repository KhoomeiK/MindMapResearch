So

March-July: Content Review general
August: take full length diagnostic test
August-Dec: focused content review based on diagnostic 
Winter Break: 2-3 full length practice tests and review of answers
Feb-March: daily practice passages
Spring Break: 1-2 full length practice tests and review of answers
April: Test

I work full time in addition to doing classes so I hope this is doable.

autoimmunity,exeuk9f,t3_csalmp,1566225705.0,"I would see a rheumatologist. Sounds like AS mostly, but could be any number of autoimmune related arthritis issues. RA can also present with uveitis. Though low back pain and knee pain aren’t generally considered hallmarks or RA, I have RA and back and knee pain were among my first symptoms, well before I had any small joint symptoms. (Though RA isn’t usually an ANA positive issue, rather RF and antiCCP are the blood makers they test for). I’ve also heard of pain symptoms in people with Hashi’s, have you had your thyroid levels checked recently? Even if thyroid levels are normal, systemic inflammation can cause pain and fatigue all on its own."
TrueChristian,exchhni,t1_exc6dsy,1566150853.0,"I completely understand your perspective and as I said I’ve been there too. For me that was something that I held on to and something that gave me hope when things felt hopeless, because I knew any circumstance was only temporary and things would definitely never get better if my life ended... but different strokes. What helped me in that place I acknowledge may not be helpful to others."
AskDocs,exbxz4u,t3_cs19b7,1566139998.0,NAD but had similar issue myself. Mine turned out to be mostly related to a tooth that needed a root canal. Still happens once in a while as it’s been healing but it’s getting much better. I doubt you need to go to the ER unless you have signs of seizure activity. But getting into your dentist and primary care both would be a good place to start. Best wishes to you!

Yes life can suck but Christ told us, “in this world you will have trials, but take heart I have overcome the world.”

I’ve been in this dark place myself, please call a suicide hotline, your pastor or talk to your family about what you are feeling. They can get you help and help you see the light at the end of this dark tunnel.

God loves you and has you here for a purpose. ❤️❤️❤️

ADHD,exbupk0,t1_exbjrhn,1566138354.0,"I linked it in my own reply to the OP, but I highly recommend Teach Students How to Learn.... it’s written for college profs but why involve the middle man when you can just read and learn from the book yourself? (It’s short, so if reading isn’t your jam don’t let the worry about length put you off)"
ADHD,exbuasm,t1_exbiunh,1566138165.0,[Why You Might Not Want to be a “Smart” Kid](https://youtu.be/5Abp3ea8jV8)  (from SciShow Psych) <— my life story in a nutshell
ADHD,exbtof6,t1_exbb4v5,1566137859.0,"I struggled with math homework in middle and high school and ended up not pursuing STEM because of it, even though I’d wanted to be a doctor since I was 4 and had been planning to major in biochem all the way up until junior year of HS. I ended up majoring in theatre with a minor in music. I got good grades (As and Bs) but knew by end of junior year that I would not be performing for a living. Now I’m back in school to get that STEM degree I always wanted. 

All that say, if STEM is what you really want to do, push through. As they say “Cs get degrees”.... But if it isn’t really what you want then it’s worth considering changing course before you get too far. I really regret that I didn’t change majors junior year when I’d already lost any passion I had for making performing arts my life."
ADHD,exbpmlo,t3_crycw2,1566135821.0,"I actually had the opposite experience. The further I went in school the better I did because I had more choice over what I was learning and was therefore more engaged. 

I struggled but got by in the prescribed courses of K-12 schooling, pulling Bs and Cs and frustrating my teachers and parents because they said my test scores showed I should be getting all As. In college I got a couple Cs but mostly As and Bs and graduated just shy of cum laude status. But I chose my major and only had to take the prescribed Gen Ed requirements. In my masters degree I got all As (though not a 4.0 because of the way my school weighed A- grades).

I didn’t get diagnosed with ADHD until after grad school. (It was partly because of what I learned in one of my child development courses). I’ve since gone back to school to do the science courses I wish I’d done the first time around (but hadn’t done because of my previous struggles with math once I hit algebra). With medication and a growth mindset I’m getting all As.

But being 2e (twice exceptional) is tough. We often get by and go undiagnosed (like I did), or get by enough that we never really develop a growth mindset. 

Just know that when you struggle it doesn’t mean you’re dumb. It means you’re learning. Struggle is your brain developing new pathways and connections. Don’t let the struggle become a wall you can’t get over, instead make the struggle a challenge and a game, get curious about it. I’m linking below to some resources that have helped me build study skills and growth mindset.

AskVet,ex9qnoe,t3_crqkpb,1566092937.0,"Are you near a vet school by chance? I would take my dog to the vet school near me for a second opinion. They might also be cheaper as often their treatments are subsidized because they are also being used to teach future veterinarians. 

Lacking that it’s still worth getting a second opinion on diagnosis, recommended treatment, likely outcome and pricing. Then you can make the best decision for you and your pooch. If he is still active that’s a good sign, IMO, even if you decide to just do palliative care.

Because I’m gonna be at work thinking someone is dying and I’ll be on the verge of panic, meanwhile you’re just wondering if I have a spatula you can borrow. 

She is slowly getting better but I still have to remind her often. 

(This is made worse by the fact that there have been a couple times when it was a family emergency. So even though 95% of the time it’s nothing, the fact that it has *ever* been something means I am *always* always on alert.)"

Baptist,ewy6hri,t3_cqo9g3,1565875695.0,"Honestly it saddens me. Most atheists I’ve met have been hardened by bad experiences with religion, usually Christians doing unbiblical and unloving things in the name of Christ. (Including my own brother and sister. We were all grievously hurt by a church we attended in our teens, I’m the only one of the three of us that has stayed with the church through my own doubts and come out still believing.)

At the same time many refuse to acknowledge that atheism also takes faith. Because none of us can know for sure for sure if there is a God in this mortal realm. We are all looking for evidence but we only see in part. (And I think even theoretical physicists would agree with that).

To me agnostics are probably the most intellectually honest. That truly is the world view that requires the least faith. 

In some ways I’m a Christian agnostic. I take it on faith that God exists and the Bible is true and that Christ was raised. I see evidence for its truth around me and I know the reasonable arguments for my faith. But I also can never know with scientific certainty that it’s true until I die.

I wonder do atheists feel similarly?"
AskDocs,ewusjgg,t3_cq90g2,1565790618.0,"NAD, but are you sure this is cystitis? With the bleeding and pain you report it could be pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine fibroids, or even something like endometrial cancer. You should definitely be checked out by a doctor. If you can’t get in to see your regular Ob/Gyn or PCP soon then I’d even consider going to urgent care. 

I had breakthrough bleeding myself that ended up being from fibroids.

Hope you can get some answers soon and find healing!"

AskDocs,ewp98il,t1_ewo5jz5,1565636191.0,"Indeed, though some specialists themselves require a referral even if your insurance doesn’t. (Just from personal experience, my insurance does not require any referral to see a specialist, but when I went to see a neurologist and later a rheumatologist they required a referral to see me as a new patient). So it can often be just a safer bet to start with primary care. 😕"
AskDocs,ewnnk9x,t1_ewnewbl,1565583706.0,Unfortunately a lot of specialists require a referral from your primary care to get an appointment that’s the main reason I suggested starting there. They can also run blood work that might help narrow down possibilities. If you can get straight into a derm without a referral by all means go for it! :)
AskDocs,ewmyoy2,t1_ewmdagl,1565563902.0,"NAD. You should not need to go to a hospital to be seen for this, just a doctor's office visit will suffice, and if you have Medicaid or other insurance it's usually a reasonable co-pay. Your primary care doctor (probably a pediatrician or family medicine doc) may be able to diagnose and treat and if not they can definitely refer you to a dermatologist who can. The fact that you're experiencing pain makes me suspect it's more than just male pattern baldness (though I am NAD, much less a dermatologist). As others have suggested it could be autoimmune alopecia or other autoimmune condition (lupus, hypothyroid), contact dermatitis, etc. And only a doctor can assess that. 

Do you have a school nurse or even NP you could consult if your mom won't allow you to have a doctor's visit?"
