No matter what I did to rebel it was a “cool we literally don’t care what you do”, j got 8 tattoos in the 6 months after I turned 18 and they just rolled their eyes. I do think they’re kinda amused by it sometimes. I am very anxious and do suffer from a lot of mental health issues and severe attachment/abandonment issues. I always kinda took on my friends parents as my own. I’m very lucky because I’m now with someone who is really helping me and his parents are the best. We’re 19 and 20 and I actually spend every night over there because of my parents and it’s really helped my parents and my relationship.

He is the nicest most fantastic guy I’ve ever met. He doesn’t personally have any behaviors I would be worried about that would be abusive towards me. Honestly, he has one friend who isn’t a top notch guy just in his relationships and that does worry me. His family is also full of alcoholics. We both have family members that have died due to it and his moms mom left her at 16 and moved half way across the country and didn’t tell her because she would drink and do what she wanted. Honestly the difference is I saw and experienced it he’s heard about it and been warned. 
   I have a huge anxiety surrounding losing someone I love in anyway but especially car accidents or the likes. Also something I’ve gotten a lot better with over the last few years but the virus has stirred that up a lot. It’s just a big safety thing in my head that being drunk especially in my life is unsafe in some way. I know he’s smart and wouldn’t actually do anything on purpose but he gets wrapped up in stuff and can get distracted or follow along even when it’s not ideal. But I’m not at all “not allowing” him to drink or anything, I’ll be around up until the point where he’s drunk and at that point I’d make sure he’s safe and tell him goodnight but I totally want him to do whatever and I trust him in those situations I just don’t want to be a part of it 
    I love him and trust him more than anyone else and he generally understands where I’m coming from. He just doesn’t get why I can sit around and smoke but don’t want to be around if he’s totally drunk. (To be honest as well I have been around while he’s been drunk, at the very beginning of our relationship he would be home and get drunk, he was fine but I was having a panic attack the whole time and wound up telling him goodnight since I knew he was safe)"

I wasn’t that into it but I tried to play it up a little and he was never interested. It always kinda bummed me out, not because I wanted to blow him but because I felt like he didn’t want me or something. Eventually we had a real conversation and he told me he just isn’t that into sex especially at the beginning and blow jobs were just kinda meh for him. Then I totally got it and we switched gears. As stupid as this is, the further I get into my relationship the more I realize especially with sex just say exactly whatever is going on and really talk.

I paid the $150 to do it myself when I turned 18, few days after I got it I was going to leave and they asked where I was going. Told them the dispo lol, they asked and I told them I got the card and it was ultimately up to me. With either way make sure at some point if you’re still living with them you agree to follow the rules they’d state with pot. My parents didn’t want me smoking in the house and a few other things.

Make sure you also let them know gently how much it could hurt them to not have that support from family, keeping their mental health safe is important.

I’ve struggled with the rest of the world however. Continuing to use the correct name and pronouns is a great start. For the family that will be supportive gently talking to them or reminding them to use the right name and such will be good. Taking them out shopping for clothes or whatever they need in their transition and being someone who listens will be the best.

Although staying until you get fired and possibly getting money isn’t worth the potential stress of not getting the money and having a not great reference on your resume. I don’t have facts sorry, it’s just my opinion"
Advice,fiozdv4,t3_f9225h,1582594542.0,"There’s a possibility nothings awkward between you two because she likes you as a friend and is glad you weren’t awkward or upset afterwards. There have been times with my guy friends where they asked me out, I politely said I wasn’t interested and tried to give a solid, kind reason why. I honestly didn’t want to be asked again. If I felt like I was potentially interested I felt comfortable coming to them to say so because they had expressed previous interest, but then we’re respectful and mature. It’s not healthy to be hung up on someone, I’m sorry to say, I’ve been there too and it’s one of the toughest things but moving on will feel so good and free! Then if she is interested you didn’t burn a bridge and if she isn’t you have her as a friend. I know people will say go for it and if you do take it slow for sure, no need for big gestures, a simple heart to heart would be more comfortable for both of you"
sex,fio2lb4,t1_fio2dxn,1582575075.0,"Fair, just make sure it doesn’t come across like you blaming her just that you personally aren’t ready. It was a mutual decision (from what I can tell) so I wouldn’t make her feel guilty"
sex,fio16mq,t1_fio0aa2,1582574286.0,"She did answer your question though so I wouldn’t be too upset with her, she did nothing wrong. I’m not sure what you’re expecting from another conversation, she’s been with one person, she told you her history and you slept with her. You’ll have to ask what the test tests for, what is included at your GP may be different especially country to country. Also no STD test is going to come back with ANYTHING for at least a few WEEKS. I would wait to have another sexual experience until you can emotionally handle it for sure."
sex,finz7e2,t3_f8wnt3,1582573157.0,"I really really wouldn’t worry. It sounds a lot like you’re overthinking things and generally none of that means you have an STD, also not sure why you included the info about you psychically but I wouldn’t worry especially about soreness in your throat, it could mean anything maybe you slept with your mouth open and your throat got too dry! Although it’s of course possible to get an STD from oral, if she says she’s clean and you didn’t see anything pointing otherwise you should be fine. Intercourse wise you used a condom so again you should be fine. If you’re still worried in a few weeks there’s no harm in getting tested. Honestly though it just sounds like maybe it wasn’t the right time and it’s causing stress, I really don’t see why you should be worried but I understand there’s always a concern. Edit: also you’ll have a weird taste after oral sometimes haha"
sex,fillqg6,t3_f8irob,1582504561.0,What works for me is straddling my guys thigh and grinding against him. He puts his hands on my hips and it’s good. I would say if you’re not sure hands are usually easier to control and tell. Or ask! I always like when a partner asks about what I like/my comfort.
sex,filky53,t3_f8io4h,1582504017.0,"I mean yeah, a women who is comfortable having sex and has made that choice generally enjoys sex sometimes-regularly. I personally have an extremely high sex drive especially with my partner we have sex at least daily but it’s different for everyone. His is lower so he works with me. I would argue though that placing people as “whores” or “sluts” is derogatory and that view of women is and will be tough for relationships. It sounds like you may not be ready for a relationship emotionally and that’s totally ok. But to answer your question yes women generally enjoy sex (as a general statement)."

I drilled three holes each, they were pretty tiny and I was worried about drainage so I did a little more perilite in my soil mix!"
sex,fgzuxw1,t3_f0qgqv,1581197903.0,"My fiancé will get me off right before bed, roll me over, tuck me in and puts me to bed lol. I offer but he usually gets me off a few times and wears me out. But that’s his intention. Trust me he gets reciprocation the rest of the time lol"
love,fgzuo0c,t3_f0quvl,1581197801.0,"I got 5 cards (with dogs since they’re his fav) for the 5 senses and he’s going on a scavenger hunt lol. I have a NY city pass for sight (we’re going in March) favorite snacks for taste, fuzzy blanket for touch, bubble bars for smell and I’m stuck on hearing lol!"
RandomKindness,ffgg0wx,t3_ethiv8,1579905400.0,"Hi! I’m planning my parents a surprise party for their 25th wedding anniversary. I’m a freshman in college and yesterday as I was driving to class my transmission and battery died. I have a few packs of balloons for the party on a wish list that would really help. Thank you for considering, this is a really kind gesture! [balloons ](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/9CA2P3D4XW93?ref_=wl_share)"
BDSMcommunity,ffga6zr,t3_eta3c9,1579901788.0,Honestly if it’s a hard pass it’s a hard pass. Something like struggle play can be a really weird or sensitive topic and if someone isn’t into it I personally wouldn’t keep pushing it. It doesn’t sound like he’s against the other stuff just the part where he’s supposed to pretend to force you after a no. You can maybe just confirm with him that’s what he means and go from there.
love,ff897rr,t3_es56dp,1579669716.0,There’s tons of groups for this on Facebook with like 20k people!! I’d you look up “my love is so big it’s reached” on Facebook a ton of groups will pop up! I’m currently doing this for my parents 25th anniversary present!
BDSMAdvice,ff808fp,t3_erqdqr,1579662617.0,My guy has a lower sex drive than I do and honestly it hurts sometimes when I try to get him going and he brushes me off. It feels like I’m not sexy enough or unwanted but it’s literally just that he doesn’t jump to sex when I’m around. What I’ve learned though is sadly a sex drive is one thing that’s hard to change. If you don’t desire sex as often it’s just the way it is. What I’ve done is I’ve “asked” less and done more. I’ll kiss on him or show him something sexual or tease him about something to put the thought there. It’s hard but requiring more sex won’t really work either. I hope y’all figure it out!
