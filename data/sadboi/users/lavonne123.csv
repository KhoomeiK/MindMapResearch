trashy,fr0d0c6,t1_fr09zhw,1589791269.0,"It’s ok.. I’m put myself in the situation. I worked for streammate. A cam model site. I was desperate for money to pay bills. There was no nudity or show unless the customers paid for them. I finally got the feature for GOLD shows. Which meant I could have multiple people buy in to a show and make a good chunk of cash for a few minutes. It took me months to get the feature even though I already met the expectations for this “privilege”. My first GOLD show I got so excited. I did all the dirty stuff because that’s what the customers wanted and I just wanted my customers to come back again and be loyal. I made $49... The site I worked for recorded and posted my video on several tube sites. They titled it with the the wrong user name so that I didn’t get any actual customers from the “exposer”.

Despite my Constant requests to take it down.. it’s still there. It’s buried deep 4 years later with thousands of views of different site.

Cam models have the illusion that they are in control of their lives and finances. But they forget there is a man at the top of the pyramid making $30,000 a month while they do all the work and made a couple thousand. 

New age PIMPS!

Anyways my point is that I was not raped... I cannot possibly compare my experience to this woman’s. I’m angry while she is destroyed. There’s a difference. My heart goes out to her."

I dunno why.. but it’s a real problem no one talks about."
trashy,fr09sdw,t3_glpdcb,1589788220.0,Porn hub doesn’t take down videos. Female victims do not have rights on these free porn sites. It doesn’t matter what the scenario is. They do not care. Unfortunately the people that read the complaints and emails for requests of take downs probably jerked off to the videos you asked to be taken down and then left it up in spite of you. Speaking from experience.
Vent,fr09e8g,t3_glruvw,1589787858.0,This has happened to me a few times. Always when I’m facing away from the camera. It’s really hard knowing that you don’t have control over something so personal and intimate. I once had a guy threaten to put all of my nudes and vids that were private between us online. I pretty much let him know I would hire a lawyer and sue him for revenge porn. He shut up about it. But I’m sure he still jerks off to our vids unless his next girlfriend has some self respect and made him Delete it. I don’t mean to generalize men..  but men are gross pigs. Even my husband.

While I was cleaning the men’s bathrooms was always the worst. I had a guy that always came in and would pretend to pull out his dick while I was scrubbing the toilet. One time he came into my janitor closet, closed the door, pushed me against the wall and kissed me. He was 6ft 3 and well over 200 pounds. At another place I cleaned that was a welding plant. I would be the only female in a building of 90 men. This one guy came into the bathroom to “chat me up” he then told everyone there that I sucked his dick by the urinals. 

In a completely different state and different job, the maintenance guy came into my office, shut the door behind him and then proceeded to chase me around the room telling me how nice of an ass I had and how he wanted a piece of it. I yelled at him to get the fuck out! 

I never turned anyone in because I was just happy to have a job and I didn’t want to jeopardize it and I didn’t want others to lose their job. But I should have done what you did and taught them a fucking lesson. 

Honestly I am proud of you. Thanks for standing up for yourself."

Then I taught myself to drive a manual.

I have a good memory of bunny hopping around the block because I was having trouble getting out of first gear and a bunch of Middle Aged men on their porch were cheering me on every time I passed by their house. It really gave me the courage to keep trying even though it was hard. When I could finally get it right the excitement that these strangers showed was something I’ll never forget.

For my my symptoms mostly manifest in mood swings.

Suicidal thought, low self esteem, rage episodes, pushing away my loved ones, being extremely sensitive and very annoyed by everyone. I get hyper sensitive to noises and commotion around me. I cry a lot, I’m anxious as fuck to the point of muscle tightness and pain. I am not agreeable at all. I just want to sleep and avoid people in general. I become almost unrecognizable as a person. I want to hurt myself and others. This isn’t healthy!! 

But I also suffer from extreme bloating and abdominal discomfort. Bad dreams, extreme fatigue, lethargic feelings like I took benedryll. But then at the same time I can’t sleep at night. My muscles hurt, my joints hurt and I gain almost 10 pounds every month, then lose it after. 

The hardest part to deal with is the emotional part. Ruined friendships and relationships. 

So take notes of your symptoms and take it to a dr. Preferably female. Start trying antidepressants. Ssri’s. This will help with your serotonin levels and even you out. 

The other symptoms are manageable. The emotions are hard to overcome without help. So don’t be afraid to get help."
