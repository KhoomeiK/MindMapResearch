Now, I truly do feel alone and isolated and I hate it and don't want to do it anymore. However, because I never picked up the phone, no one will call me unless I call them first. Which makes me feel even more isolated. It's definitely a vicious circle."

SuicideWatch,euwoys7,t3_chnpds,1564077814.0,"I called the hotline for the first time about a month or so ago. And I didn't call for the exact same reasons that you haven't. What am I going to say? Are they going to send the police to my house? Are they going to call my family and they're going to find out? All of those questions and then somewhere rattling around in my head.
But after I did it, afterwards I thought, I drove myself crazy all this time over this? That was nothing. I started talking with them and for the first 5 or so they were just trying to get a read on me on what I was thinking and stuff like that. After that we just started talkin about stuff and he steered me towards everyday conversation. For the last 5-10 minutes we were talking about The Walking Dead. Just like that I didn't want to die anymore. The whole thing from beginning to end lasted maybe 20 minutes.
It's amazing how much it helps just to have another person to talk to for a little bit. Because when I spend a substantial amount of time in my own world my thoughts tend to spiral. I don't have to tell you that our mind can be our own worst enemies sometimes. I'm not an old veteran in this, I'm just barely one step ahead of you in the treatment process. So I know. But considering where you are, you need to be seeing your therapist weekly not every month. You also might want to think about getting on an antidepressant. Wellbutrin has helped me a lot.
My therapist told me about this YouTube video talking about loneliness and how being lonely for extended period of time actually changes the way you think. It's pretty interesting. Here's the link below.

SuicideWatch,eurphjc,t3_ch5tsy,1563997194.0,"I personally know a guy that shot himself in the head twice in one suicide attempt and still lived. How did he manage to do that you ask? The first time he put the gun in his mouth, but he didn't angle it high enough. So instead of hitting his brain, it exited out the back of his head without hitting anything. It knocked him unconscious and when he woke up she thought ""Seriously?!?"" So he took the gun and put it under his chin, but once again he angled it badly. So instead of going through his brain the bullet traveled along the front of his skull, blew out one of his eyes, and exited through his forehead. He obviously has some memory gaps from that day and he lost an eye. But he realized it wasn't his time and he hasn't tried it again since."

evansville,eunpe4o,t3_cgwwyw,1563931804.0,"I disagree that downtown Evansville is dead. If you told me that 35 years ago, I would completely agree with you. But over the last 20 years, the city government has gotten serious about revitalizing the area. Plus, now that Indiana University has opened a medical school there. The city is very motivated to encourage more businesses to invest in the area. If you want to see what some people consider ""dead"" then go down to the riverfront on any afternoon and you'll laugh when you see how wrong they are.
The west side is a nice place to live, but there is a mentality over there that you need to be aware of. Over there, you are either a West Sider or an outsider even if you both live in the same town. In NYC, you'll meet people that have never left a 10 square block radius for their entire life. We have that over here too, we call it the west side. Their battlecry is ""why would I ever leave this side of town? Everything I need is right here."" Don't get me wrong, the vast majority of them are very nice people. But a lot of them have that mentality.
Since everyone else is told you the good neighborhoods. I thought I would tell you about the bad neighborhoods to avoid. We have one big area over here and one smaller one. The big area goes from Highway 41 to Diamond Avenue, South along Pigeon Creek, down Riverside Drive to the Veterans Parkway until you hit 41 again. With the Lloyd Expressway being the dividing line between the two. There are two nicer neighborhoods in that area which is downtown to the library and the historic neighborhood just south of downtown. The other one starts at Garvin Park to Morgan Avenue going east until you get by the old North High School. The area north of the Lloyd Expressway is the white ghetto or they call it JimTown, Boxtown, etc. In that area there's a lot of drug activity, break-ins, and home invasion. The area south of the Lloyd is the predominantly black ghetto. The worst part of it being from Kentucky Avenue to Washington Avenue and everything south of that. That's mainly where the worst crime is in the city. A lot of gang activity, drug activity, murders, etc.
The smaller bad area is a group of Section 8 projects that we call Savannah Gardens. It's on the east side and it runs from Vann Avenue to Covert Avenue north on Professional Blvd and west along Washington Avenue. The crime around there is predominantly drug activity, theft, and break-ins.
You were asking about hospitals and I would say Gateway is the best facility. It's the newest and best equipped, I think. The second best would be St Vincent and finally Deaconess. But Deaconess isn't in a great neighborhood, so there's that."
evansville,eui6a2v,t3_ce8pk1,1563841262.0,"At Boonville New Harmony Road and Highway 41 there are a couple of shopping complexes that have been built over the years. There's two grocery stores including a Schnucks, a CVS, and several very good restaurants. I know all this because my mom lives in Darmstadt. The 4-H Center is located there and that's where the Vanderburgh County Fair is held and several other shows over the course of the year.
As far as high school kids in that area, I would think they would go to North. I know that the elementary kids go to Scott School. Which is only 1.5 miles from North. So it makes sense that they would.
Edit: Darmstadt being a small town, the businesses around there keep small-town hours. Most of them start closing about 9-10."

If you're going to criticize someone else for not being a perfect driver. Then you should probably practice what you preach before you start complaining about others."

That first week it would definitely give me a jolt of energy. So you want to take it first thing in the morning. However, I did have insomnia for that first week. I take melatonin at night and that helped out.
The only long-term side effect that I've experienced is, when I'm with my girlfriend, it can take me longer than normal to orgasm. But I don't consider that a bad thing. lol
Just whatever you do, don't miss a dose. The first time I did it was in my first week and so it wasn't really in my system yet. But the second time it happened was a month into taking it and I experienced the most suicidal depression I've ever had in my life. So I'll never make that mistake again.
