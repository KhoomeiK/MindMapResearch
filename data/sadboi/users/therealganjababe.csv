I believe what happened is gifs got popular and people outside of the industry just didn't know how to pronounce it, it's something you see in text, you didn't hear the name aloud much when they began catching on with the general public.

cripplingalcoholism,fq41guw,t1_fq3u2hg,1589072649.0,"Gotcha, sounds fun :/

I agree, alcohol just soothes my brain in a different way than other substances. Weed can improve my mood, sometimes provide motivation. But it rarely fully quiets my mind like alcohol does. I hated my dad being an alcoholic growing up, thought I'd never touch the stuff. Instead I did hard drugs lol. Once I got clean of being a straight up junkie, I turned to alcohol. That's a pattern in my life, I get off one by moving on to another, never been fully clean of any addictions since I was 16. I usually have a couple going at once. I vape like, every minute of the day, smoke weed idk, 5-10 times a day. Stuff my face with candy or fried foods, etc. But I still need to drink, it's just a different kind of relief.

Hey, idk if you take anything for your anxiety, obvs benzos have their own issues and I try to stay away from them as I've done too much recreationally in my past. But I take hydroxozine, it's a prescription anti histamine. It helps a lot, and is non addictive, I take it as needed, if I have an anxiety attack or on hangover days. It helps my nervous system calm down after that alcohol rebound that hits you a few hours after sleeping. Stops the fear and twitching and restless legs. I don't know what I'd do without it. Just a thought :)"

cripplingalcoholism,fq3ji64,t1_fq3c48h,1589067108.0,"Damn, yeah a bottle a day will do that I guess, for some anyway. My dad's a functional drink, worked a full time job, never drank at work, but drank as soon as he came home til he passed out. Only reason I'm not at that level is my husband doesn't drink, and I can only get him to hang out with me while drinking a few times a week, as I drink til dawn and he gets up early. If he was more into drinking I do believe I'd be drinking every day and in much worse shape, if I were even still here. 

Drinking's always been about socialization to me, I almost never drink alone. If I do, my thoughts will get ugly.  Plus I wind up doing some weird shit sometimes lol, which kinda freaks me out the next day. I never got past the binge drinking teen/young adult party culture. Once I start, well, you know how it is I'm sure. But I think my compulsive and impulsive tendencies make it worse than the usual 'alcohol making you want more'. I can not stop til I'm passing out or blacking out, if I'm made to stop I'll get angry or cry hysterically and even get suicidal. 

So I binge and play games or whatever with hubby, even tho he really doesn't care to. But it's the only thing I find 'fun'. And it gives me energy which being bipolar, I'm exhausted and unmotivated all the time, and that energy and excitement is everything to me. Looking forward to that gets me through the day. Then the next day my brain is calm for once... I feel like shit, but my brains not yelling at me. Day later, edgy and ready to get fucked up, rinse & repeat. Sigh. It's fucked because my addiction is mostly psychological, I get some withdrawal in lieu of real hangovers, but not like if I drank daily. But I can't get past that psychological need, and without fulfilling it somehow I just don't feel like life's worth the pain I go through mentally. It's not just alcohol, that's just been my DOC the last decade or 15 years. I basically get addicted to anything I try. Food, weed, vaping, every drug I've ever tried, sex. Doesn't matter what it is, I just always need something or I hate life and can't stand living.

I honestly spend half my life wanting to die, and the other half afraid of dying. Mental illness is a bitch.

Hoping to ramp up exercise as it's getting nicer now and lose some weight, hopefully that helps it heal a bit. Of course the biggest thing aside from alcohol is diet, but sadly I don't see that changing either. And that probably sounds like I'm not even bothering to try, on the contrary, I've been trying to make these changes for 20 years and it hasn't worked. Half my life I'm hypomanic and half I can barely get off the couch. I'm just at the point where I have to be realistic and accept that I'm too weak to change. My life is just a wreck. 

So if I exercise and try to lose weight, which sans alcohol would be a big recommendation to heal the liver, and protect against future drinking as much as I can with supplements, think there's any chance I'll at least hold steady?

I know quitting alcohol is the only way to really prevent further damage, but as I said, I just don't see that happening so I'm trying to mitigate future damage as much as I can. Stretch out time a bit at least. Idk, grasping at staws here."

I'm destructive and have no fn willpower and decades of ingrained bad habits, along with bad coping skills. I just stopped seeing my therapist as I wasn't getting very far with him, and with Covid I haven't looked for a new one yet. Oh and my shrink says these are things to talk to my therapist about. She makes small talk for like 1.5mins, confirms my meds/sends scripts, and that's it. Good docs are hard to find."
