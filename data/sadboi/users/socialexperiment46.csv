[Inspired by this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/c5ay0f/looking_for_advice_or_support_in_assessing/)

Sometimes women, married or single, ask about signals they're getting from married men.  Or they want to know how best to approach a married man they're sexually interested in.   Or they want to know if a married man's signals to her are indicators of sexual interest.     So, I'm writing to these women:  Women interested in how best to approach married men and what signals married men are usually throwing out.  

A good number, if not most, married men would be open to sexual relationships outside their marriages.   Most married men who don't cheat, don't because either (1) they're very religious, or (2) they're totally oblivious to the fact that some woman out there is sexually interested in them, or most often, (3) they're so unattractive they can't attract a woman who would cheat with them.  

A good number of married men, even married men who had not before considered stepping out, would be open to a sexual relationship outside their marriages if they know the woman is a ""sure thing"".  (Notice, I'm including the guilt kings in here -  I'm saying they'd be *open*  to an affair.  I'm not saying they'd all *actually have* affairs or that they'd be *capable* of seeing it through without losing their shit.)  In other words, before proceeding any further with a woman, **the married man must be absolutely certain she is sexually interested in him.**   He can't risk approaching her if he isn't sure about her sexual interest. If he misreads the situation, he risks the woman getting offended and morally outraged.  She'll contact his wife via social media and tell the wife all about how her husband is a cheating pig and hit on her and is out there tomcatting around.  And then his shit is blown sky high.   In today's # MeToo era, men simply cannot be too careful in this regard.    Married men looking to step out, or who are even thinking about stepping out,  absolutely MUST make sure this area of risk is virtually 100% neutralized.  

So, ladies, if you are interested in a married man, you will have to make at least one first move.  You are going to have to make it very, very clear to him that you're sexually interested in him.   I don't know the best ways to do that. [One user in a recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/c5ay0f/looking_for_advice_or_support_in_assessing/es0r6gh/) suggested ""looking into his eyes and asking if you can suck his cock"".    You might not have to be THAT overt.  But some things you can do include touching him frequently, being alone with him, telling him you and he should get together alone for drinks, and even putting your hand on his cock through his pants.  

I don't know.  Some of these things might even be too forward.   But one thing is for sure - **women interested in married men cannot act like single women looking to attract single men.**   Flirting isn't enough.   Making direct eye contact across a bar isn't enough.    Being nice isnt' enough.  Being around him isn't enough.  Doing things for him isn't enough.  Engaging him in conversation isn't enough.  Even befriending him or being his ""work wife"" isn't enough.   You will have to be very, very, VERY clear about your interest - that you know he's married, that you're sexually interested in him, *and that he can trust you* at least not to say anything about the interaction if it doesn't go anywhere.

Most married men who step out, or who are considering stepping out, are putting out feelers most of the time for interested women.  Almost all the time, if a man is talking to you, he's sexually interested in you.  It doesn't matter if he's married - if he's paying attention to you, he's sexually interested in you.  **Almost every interaction a man has with a woman is a probe for sexual availability.**  Almost every interaction a man has with any woman is essentially ""I'm sexually interested in you and I'm trying to find out if you are also sexually interested in me.""  

 He might never say so.  He might never act on it any further.   It might never go beyond conversation and smiles.  And, 95%+ of the time, it never goes any further, and the sexual interest and feelers he puts out either go unresponded to or gently, covertly rebuffed.     But make no mistake about it - he is sexually interested.  If you return sexual interest in a very clear, very overt manner, he will return it back again.   But, women, if you're interested in a married man, you *must* make it *very* clear.  So clear that a 10 year old could tell what you're getting at.  

Ladies, I know.  I know it's uncomfortable.  I know you're not accustomed to it.  I know it's hard.  But if you want that married guy you will have to make it safe for him to proceed.   The way you make it safe for him to proceed is to send him a clear signal that your interest in him is sexual and that he can trust you.  

Hope this helps."
