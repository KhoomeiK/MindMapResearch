And you're right, I forget that alot of people are kids on here that really don't know how to think for themselves and really do compare trump to hitler.  I voted for trump. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è go figure.  He's not the best president but I don't think he's the worst either (neither was obama)  but looking back, my thinking was vote for trump or vote for clinton, and I didn't want to vote for her either.  Not anything against her, but I remember the going-ons with Bill and don't want to see a replay of that, which he was a draft dodger too which it seems like a lot of people forgot or just don't know or care."

BPD,f57lr0x,t1_f56xuvl,1572038745.0,"It does sound similar to what I'm going through.  Before my FP completely refused to talk to me she would say things that she knew would make me feel bad.  I wish I had answers but probably won't ever have them.

The best thing to do (so I've been told) is to completely block them out of your life.  I've done that with mine but it hasn't really gotten any easier yet so idk"
BPD,f56sf97,t1_f56ny3g,1572027125.0,Thank you :)  I'm hoping it does get easier.  I'm in no way innocent in all this.  I just wish I didn't act the way I did and that I would have been more conscious of my actions and words before now.

My problem was, she would say something that she didn't want to be together than in the next breath say something sweet to give me that glimmer of hope to hold on to.

Your best best is to be very straight forward and leave no room for interpretation.   If there is any doubt, you leave room for clinging.

Hope it helps"

She ended up contacting the police for me to have no contact with her.  It hurts, but I understand why.  The way I treated her was like how your GF was treating  you.  BPD is the reason for the emotions but not an excuse.  The best thing you can do at this point is no contact.  They'll be hurt but clear boundaries might be the only way to get your point across."
