but thank you so much for staying connected and asking a further question, we don‚Äôt even know each other more than a few words but you already seem to have a sense of concern and care."

AskReddit,fot5vu9,t1_fosbhv0,1588045345.0,"i love the way you describe him.  he sounds so wonderful.  one night i decided to go to the local market night with my best friend.  This is where the local farmers would bring their goods and there was live music and lights and it filled up a street downtown.  

There was this moment where we were just walking and he was talking to me, telling me something while smiling and giggling through his story.  In that moment i felt happier than i had ever been, in that moment i was with the person i love the most and I was completely content.  I don‚Äôt even know what he was talking about, I just remember looking at him and thinking ‚ÄúThat is my best friend and I love him with my whole heart.‚Äù

Just recently was his birthday and while on the phone (due to quarantine) i could hear him smiling through his words again, and that made my lil heart so happy."

mentalhealth,foppzb2,t3_g8o3ux,1587968439.0,"I completely understand this and experience a shape of this as well, not to your extent though.  When I fall into a decline mentally, the not wanting to be touched is more of a self conscious defense mechanism.  Like when body dysmorphia takes over i cannot even fathom the thought of someone else touching my body.  I hate the thought of them feeling what I am living in."
