This is the part that concerns me. I'm half Asian and *definitely* had to hear this mess growing up from extended family. Adults set in their backwards colorist ways are impossible to convince otherwise, but I feel for the little girl.

I just started emdr therapy for trauma, but it's difficult to feel completely heard in regards to racial issues as she is a white woman. But my usual therapist is mixed race, and my very first therapist was a black woman, and it was so reassuring to know that my thoughts were indeed valid, and I wasn't just overreacting to racially or gender specific things that happened to me. It also takes time. It takes a while to form a bond and to go over your life story with someone new, and I've been seeing a therapist consistently for years now."
