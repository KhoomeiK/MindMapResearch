ClotSurvivors,fbuv45e,t1_fbu2e7n,1577120847.0,"Sure. All three of my clots started in my upper thigh area. The first was after running and my leg started to swell. I was on BC but a college athlete so active. By the time I arrived in ER the clot ran ankle to lower hip. Back then they did the dye test and I waited horizontally in ICU for it to dissolve with Heparin drip and Coumadin. I stayed on Coumadin for a few years and had testing to figure out the Factor V background. The second one was 20 years later. It started in the same area and ran ankle to upper thigh. This one they took out that day. The probe went in and placed a IVC filter first then they dissolved the clot. No pain but the placement of the stent was a little uncomfortable. Easy and quick. I went home that evening. Back on Coumadin for life. I switched to Xarelto a few months later. When I went back to sports, the Xarelto seemed to cause a lot of muscle and back pain so I went to Eloquis. Last year I had knee surgery up in Vail and my bridging from Coumadin to Eloquis was bad. Two days later and another clot forms! This one I catch quickly but the vascular surgeon wants it dissolved. So I stay in ER with the catheter in through my ankle (the most painful of all of this saga). They did the clot busting cocktail all night. The clot is sucked up the next morning this time away from my lungs. This time they supposedly scrub the vein walls. Another stent is installed. I go home that afternoon. I’m on Eloquis now. No high altitude surgeries anymore, no BC, listen to the pain, hydrate! I still compete & wear a compression sock on my bad leg. My leg looks like crap. I don’t complain too much considering my second thrombolysis was delayed when Claire Davis was brought into the ER. She was shot at Arapahoe High School and they bumped me down. She died, so there is perspective. Oh, also I made them remove the IVC filter a few months after it was inserted. Those will cause clots. At every step you learn you must be an advocate for your health care. I also fired the bad bridging hematologist! The vascular team is one of the best in the US...RIA Endo"
ClotSurvivors,fbt99ez,t3_eedamh,1577071816.0,My first one supposedly dissolved and then 20 years later another clot forms in the exact spot when my hormones start to change. My hemo said the first clot had probably left residual factors on the vein wall. The endovascular surgeons were incredible. They went through my carotid artery and did the catheter directed thomolysis which took about 20 mins. They give you a local and you sit in front of some computer screens. They also inserted a stent through that process. My dr never called my situation ‘chronic’. I’ve got Factor V and took birth control and didn’t take care of myself. My third was 2 days after knee surgery. I’m fairly confident that with my Eloquis and diligence I won’t have a fourth. I’m still very active. This isn’t going to hold me down...just need to listen to my body.  Prayers your way!
ClotSurvivors,fbt64zr,t1_fbszlhx,1577069324.0,"I agree with this. I’ve had 3 in the exact same leg, same origin, same length. I now have two stents.
