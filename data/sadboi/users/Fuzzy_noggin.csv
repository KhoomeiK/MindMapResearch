Anxiety,foqnjk9,t3_g8v0l8,1587997348.0,"Completely!!! I have mentioned this to a few people in my life already, like everyone has said, it's the improved work life balance, the reduction of responsibilities, and the increase in comfort and safety that I'm going to struggle to get rid of. I feel peaceful for the first time in ages. I think for me it is always much easier to shrink my life than it is to expand it. The world feels bigger and scarier every day, and I hope we are able to be eased back into it when the time comes."
Anxiety,fmtun7h,t1_fmpqkh8,1586379303.0,Not at all :) it's definitely scary to commit to things but the great thing is you can stop committing as quickly as you started.
Anxiety,fmfpaak,t3_fuzpsa,1586032022.0,"This is not selfish at all!!! Of course it's a global problem, but the ripple effect it's had into every corner of our lives is HUGE, and the uncertainty definitely a trigger for anxiety. Especially when you know someone immunocompromised, and ESPECIALLY when you're at a critical point in your education. Housing instability is incredibly stressful, we're in the process of moving (luckily of our own choice, we found the place before lockdown) and it's been totally shrouded in uncertainty as to whether we'll even be able to go because of government restrictions. I hope you try to take comfort in the little moment and create a routine that helps to relax you ✨ don't feel alone! Everyone is going through uncertainty now, and it's all incredibly valid, we've all just got to do our best :)"
Anxiety,fmfokwp,t3_fv0008,1586031608.0,Good luck - hopefully once you get started you'll be able to relax enough into it that you can let go of your notes a bit ✨
perfectionism,fm5j3a3,t3_ekorf3,1585773896.0,"Thank you for this - I really relate to all of this, and was informed of the same childhood causes by my therapist. I actually smiled at the apology of the post length, it's like you crawled inside my brain!! I'm trying to stop myself from fleshing it out more, because I feel like I've covered enough and you'll get it! Hope you're feeling good and doing well :)"
perfectionism,fm5i795,t1_fepwnru,1585773427.0,This is excellent advice and resonates deeply with some tactics I use for myself!
Anxiety,fm3x5ai,t3_fsvisd,1585740188.0,"Hello! Hope you're holding up :) I completely empathise with this. I'm 25 now, when I was 17 I felt the exact same way, and still do, but less now.

First of all - so much has happened for me just between 17-25 (that's flipping 8 years???? how??), and you'll have the opportunity to try LOADS of things if you feel able to reach out and do them. The thing I found whilst investing bits of time in all those things is that I naturally began to realise that I wasn't going to dedicate my life to most of them, but I can swap between them when I'm satisfied by the last one, you get a surprising amount done if you can divide your time up in a way that makes you happy.

I also realised that I'm just...allowed to keep learning? and changing jobs if I want? there are no rules?? I think when I finished my degree I really believed that'd be me sorted, settled and stuck on a path, but you can literally change it whenever you like. I've been in 1 career for 3 years now, and am considering changing...and I'm only halfway through my 20s. My interests have changed heaps since I was 17, so my hobbies and goals have as well.

So yes, there is only so much time, but at the same time, there is SO MUCH time. I hope you get to pursue your passions, whatever they are and however long they fulfill you for - you have decades ahead of you to see where they take you!"
Anxiety,fm3n4nb,t1_fm247nq,1585729526.0,It's so wierd! So glad to know someone else has experienced it though :) hope you can be kind to yourself and find something that suits your brain!
Anxiety,fm3n180,t1_fm26dzs,1585729425.0,"I think it depends on what underlying mood I was in, I must have had some fears bubbling around in there that overflowed everywhere! Hope you feel better!"
Anxiety,fm1zpfi,t3_fs6n8v,1585687955.0,"yes!! I have fallen into anxiety research spirals for many a disorder. spent way way WAY too much time trying to connect the dots - when the most obvious answer is.....I've become anxious again. 

It's so hard to differentiate. I guess if you know you have anxiety, you'll eventually zoom out land back at the fact that these obsessing behaviours are actually very indicative of your anxiety. I often get a gnawing feeling that the disorder isn't adding up, and over time i've become more aware of the fact that this is one of my habits when I feel bad. That is how I find it at least. hope you feel better :)"
Anxiety,fm1z2d2,t3_fs71dt,1585687615.0,"I feel that - if someone so much as has a sharp tone in their voice, I can feel my brain closing down and my eyes getting hot with tears. For me it comes from having an erratic parent who often shouted and berated, still as an adult my body just wants to curl up and get away. I hope you are able to explore and work through it! Therapy definitely helped, but my boyfriend does still have to deal with a weepy mess if he uses even so much as a short tone, which luckily and rightly so, is very uncommon."
Anxiety,fm1yhhu,t3_fsahpj,1585687309.0,Love this <3 really needing it right now!
Anxiety,fm1yeqp,t3_fsediy,1585687268.0,"Do you have someone you can go with? As much as I try not to use my partner as a security blanket (which is probably a fine thing to do but I cannae accept it), he is a huge source of support in this scenario. I am very much finding excuses to get out of going shopping. For me at least, saying my fears out loud sucks some of the power out of them, especially with reassurance from my partner. Once we got over that, whizz round as quickly as possible, and like the guys said, make a list. Once I got inside I felt so overwhelmed that I began wandering absent mindedly up and down the aisles and wondering if I should be holding my breath, not ideal. So stick to your list :)"
Anxiety,fm1wmks,t3_fsk3ai,1585686334.0,"I fit all the above criteria and would be really interested to help! My partner has pretty constant depression, and whilst I have anxiety and have had bouts of depression, I still don't feel like I truly understand, empathise with, or know how to help him. It definitely shapes our relationship. Please message me here!"
Anxiety,fm1w2xs,t3_fsia50,1585686048.0,"I also struggle with this, with exactly the same purpose behind it. Every EVERY time my manager wants to speak to me alone, I prepare myself to get fired. I guess it's a way of trying to keep control of the situation? To make sure I am ready for the unknown?

The biggest thing I learned from my CBT was to become aware of my internal assumptions - as I (obviously) can't predict the future, and my anxiety thoughts are most often wrong. We discussed the 'wait and see' concept. When I have thoughts like this, the scary, but empowering thing for me to do is hear my anxious thought, and then instead of narrowing down into that one, thinking 'let's wait and see, as it could be a number of things, and we can choose how to respond once we have the full picture'.

I'd say it only reduces my anxiety instead of eradicating it, but that's enough for me right now. I'm personally just trying to create the space for myself to allow myself the vulnerability of not being 100% prepared for every outcome - and seeing where it takes me. Hope this helps!"
Anxiety,fm1v8ea,t3_fsinko,1585685619.0,"I had a few ok experiences with weed until a party at my friend's house, where I misjudged the quantity I inhaled.

I thought I was dying, I mean I was thoroughly convinced. I thought, this is it, this is how I die. I had an unrelenting restlessness, dizziness and paranoia, and all I could do was swap between sitting and standing and asking people if I was ok. It went on for hours, and every time I looked at the clock it was only 5 minutes later. I locked myself in the bathroom and projectile vomited everywhere -  exactly like you said.

Eventually my friend found me and gave me maybe the most reassuring hug ever, and managed to get me to fall asleep. But yes. Agreed. Never again."
Anxiety,fm1upm4,t3_fsjoj8,1585685347.0,"I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS!! I saw a PT for a few months a few years back, and on certain moves, particularly arm exercises, I could begin to feel the dread and adrenaline rise in me. It happened more than once, and I had to stop and breathe and ground myself.

I googled it 'can exercise trigger anxiety', but all I got were articles about exercise helping anxiety...

Personally, I' wondering if it's a physiological response to the exertion? Like if I work out hard enough to get some adrenaline going, then my body is like..oh..adrenaline?? danger?? panic?? gogogogo! Just a mixed up message, but otherwise I don't know...let me know if you dig anything up!"
Anxiety,fm1u8ib,t3_fs3p9c,1585685104.0,"I have had this awareness and anxiety as long as I can remember - as a child it used to keep me up at night when I was lying in bed and make me feel cold throughout my whole body. I also, wierdly, used to feel it very intensely every september, whenever I got in the shower. I'd just think about how time was passing and I couldn't stop it.   


I think - if this helps at all - my advice would be to try and turn it on it's head if you feel that is possible for you. I focus on the fact that when I am most scared of dying, it shows how much I love living, and how much I want to enjoy my life. I think, for me at least, it can indicate that I'm not doing something I could be doing, and that I should probably be spending my time differently. I hope that helps - sending wishes :)"
adhdwomen,fm0442o,t1_flx20ev,1585643933.0,"I completely agree! The tiniest of tiny things, sunshine, animals, babies, a cup of tea by a window, those make me feel great. 

I think by normality I mean more like....the concept of an average life, of settling down and working a 9-5 and commuting make me feel so numb - and I still do them! Something about not really living, outside of that structure, makes me feel so scared like I'm wasting all this precious time. I don't know - maybe that's a normal thing! I just feel very trapped by it all, and it doesn't make sense to me, and I don't understand why we can't restructure it to a way that works better for everyone. The rigidity is frustrating."
adhdwomen,flwx3a6,t3_fro3yt,1585568501.0,"And one more I just remembered - needing just enough distraction to concentrate. I.e. a podcast or music or background noise, just enough to engage your brain. Too much and all focus is gone!"
adhdwomen,flul5jh,t1_fltsqmg,1585504814.0,"Hello! Thank you so much for your comment, it means a lot to have someone reach out! I agree, It's hard when you have suspicions but no evidence. I've felt like there is something beyond anxiety which is why I persued OCD which I was told was perfectionism, but I'm scared I'm just looked for a reason to validate that I feel like there's 'something wrong with me', and maybe everyone feels this way. But if everyone feels this way then I feel very bad for everyone. I just desperately don't want to feel this unmotivated and foggy all the time anymore, and I don't feel like I would know how to break through my spacey habits, if I can at all. Looking back - they were always there! 

Anyways - thank you again for commenting and for your lovely words, it's given me a bit of pep to keep going and look into my options."
adhdwomen,flrhlg0,t3_fqpgkm,1585420364.0,"FINAL COMMENT OF THINGS I JUST THOUGHT OF:

- I don't watch horror films as they imprint vividly in my mind and I can't forget about it, so avoid it hugely.

- I often get distracted walking between rooms and don't know why I'm there.

- when I'm interested in a topic, or facing a problem, I become fixated and I can't drop it till I feel satisfied. This often leads to many hours passing without my noticing, and failing to eat or go to the loo, two needs which I find irritating to have as I'd rather continue doing what I'm doing.

- I am very sensitive to sunlight and always have been, I'm always the first to put on sunglasses.

- my manager has ADHD, but I think combined type, so he's quite hyper. We both feel like we really get each other and how our brains work, which leads him to become frustrated when he sees me unable to work successfully, as he copes very well."
adhdwomen,flrggw1,t3_fqpgkm,1585419699.0,"EDIT: The other half!!!! 2/2

I used to be very forgetful, losing things often and surrounding myself with clutter (my mum called me a hoarder) that would get on top of me. As an adult, I have worked hard to remove many items from my life, becoming really drawn to minimalism, as I know I will not be able to manage lots of items and become overwhelmed easily. This still doesn't stop me from making messes and feeling unable to clean them up. This triggers a sense of perfectionism to fully clean a house, but then feeling exhausted by the idea. I often stand at my sink and stare at the dishes before walking away defeated. Other times I become obsessed with an idea, like cleaning the shower, and drop everything to scrub it and find solutions to harder to clean areas, spending way too long on it. To combat my forgetfulness I now keep only one bag and one coat in use, as I know I'll lose anything outside of that system.

I have always had what I called 'a noisy brain'. Constant thoughts from waking to falling asleep. It's formless trains of thought that I forget as soon as the pass, and often lead to me saying things to my boyfriend that finds confusing as they were so out of the blue, but I said them as if there was context. I get brain fog a lot, stopping me from focussing on anything, and I lean on scrolling through social media or watching YouTube to ride these times out, which obviously aggrivates my manager and looks very unprofessional. 

I'm very sensitive to sounds, especially repetitive ones. I can't stand ticking, chewing, dripping, buzzing, beeping, or any quiet sound that I can't identify. I often get teased for this at work and by my family as I apparently react disproportionately. On the other hand I find that I can't sleep in darkness or silence, needing light and sound to occupy my brain enough to let me fall sleep. I am sensitive to bad smells, and often struggle cleaning dishes or throwing away food waste.

As a child I was very sensitive to textures and fabrics. I found having my hair brushed very painful and often refused it, had my mother cut my itchy labels out of my clothes, refused to wear itchy fabrics, and would struggle with a lot of foods with slippery, slimy or unusual textures, something I am still working to deal with. I have always had an aversion to bath sponge texture that makes me feel queazy, and hate to even look at them or think about them - it's making me squirm now!!

I've had a lifelong fidgeting habit. I have a leg jiggle that just won't quit, and I can't sit still in chairs, contorting myself into all kinds of positions without getting comfortable. It makes meetings quite challenging. I used to doodle in school to get through classes, carrying a dedicated doodle notebook to help me pass the time.

I burnt out of uni having forced myself to complete my dissertation, and felt completely destroyed having not got a first - my 2:1 felt like a total failure and waste of time, leaving me depressed for 6 months. I was told I would be able to do very well, and how I did didn't meet my high standards.

I'm tired, alot. I don't understand how people go about having jobs, social lives, hobbies and exercise. I give everything to just going to work and often have no energy left for keeping up relationships, spending time with my boyfriend or managing my house - let alone eating well and exercising. I'm often irritable and emotional, and my moods can appear and disappear very quickly.

And finally, I react strangely to stressful and chaotic situations, like the one we find ourselves in these past few weeks. I come alive. I feel like everything makes a bit more sense, and I jump at the chance to make new systems of living and adapting to these new environment - much to the confusion of my boyfriend.  I get a buzz from it somehow, it's a breath of fresh air to the numbing mundanity of everyday life. 

Wow that was long.. I'm sure I could add more. But yes. I'm hoping I can reach out to someone and get help, because I feel like I'm drowning quite a lot, and I'm not sure I'll be able to keep going successfully for much longer. I just want to understand myself better. So thank you if you read this all, I appreciate it a lot, and hope everyone is coping alright."
