CaptainFalconMains,fpzfgm6,t3_gds0t6,1589017567.0,"If you‚Äôre having trouble approaching because of the platforms, my guess is you‚Äôre not short hopping enough. If you‚Äôre not short hop nairing, try to approach on the ground. Definitely mix it up and don‚Äôt be afraid to not approach too. But specifically for battlefield if I approach on the platforms against a character who wants to run, I like to go down in the middle between one of their shots/hits and use a special depending what I think they‚Äôre response to me approaching will be. If they try to run at you when you land, throw out a side b to catch them. If they‚Äôre campy and keeping running away I like using falcon kick to catch a roll or spotdodge. And up b if they‚Äôre just sitting in shield waiting for you to poke at them. Learn what options they want to use and punish accordingly. When they catch on that you‚Äôre trying to bait them, they will switch it up and start to stay farther away in shield. This is a very important part because you have to remember to not approach in times like this. If they clearly only have a defensive option in mind, your best bet is not to commit and to instead react to their movement without throwing out random moves. Also side note, fast fall knee drop through platform doesn‚Äôt work, but the knee will connect if you don‚Äôt fast fall when you platform drop, which can catch a roll if you see it. Better players are much better at not rolling all the time, so you‚Äôll need to adjust accordingly for your opponent. But overall try staying a little more grounded, short hop and watch out for what they can punish you for. Hope this helps cheers"
