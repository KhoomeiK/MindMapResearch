succulents,fqtanel,t3_gkucgo,1589634749.0,Thank you to both. It saves me another 2 hours researching. Any care tips for this species?
succulents,fq9k5ya,t1_fq9k2s0,1589200580.0,Is there anything we can do to save it?
succulents,fq9ij7w,t1_fq9iajj,1589199280.0,Oh thank you so much. Please can you explain a little more about forced variegation?
uksucculents,fq0q4c4,t1_fpxogae,1589035869.0,The flowers are tiny. So cute.
uksucculents,fporjtt,t1_fpopiup,1588789432.0,"As suggested by many others on here, they need some growth lights if you have very short days in your country. If they get consistent long days they will flower. But then when winter hits, the days become short consistently they will go to sleep. So this repeats through the years. Hope it helps.

I have not used any lights at all as they live next to  Big windows. And there is a massive difference between the hours of light exposure through the year."
HLCommunity,fpdiw6i,t1_fpcx4cx,1588527872.0,Yes I am aware. I am just overly cautious with sex..... I guess i am going to choose not having any sex at all to having casual sex.
HLCommunity,fpc9dlr,t1_fpc1r9a,1588492136.0,Thank you for saying that. I am actively looking for solutions to deal with this....... Let's say there is no rejection (haha) I still need to find a way to deal with it on my own. I don't think having sex with someone else is an option.
HLCommunity,fpc8x0i,t1_fpb5f8s,1588491663.0,"It is more a long term issue. I am constantly HL and even if I have a partner who wants to meet my needs, I can't just go for it every time. So if I can lower my HL to match his that would be easier? Idk"
HLCommunity,fpb3azv,t1_fpb0abh,1588461220.0,Both. It is lockdown and he is unavailable.
HLCommunity,fpa7one,t1_fpa6w4h,1588442484.0,That is very good for your physical and mental health. Keep doing it!!!
HLCommunity,fpa61hy,t1_fpa4oq5,1588441531.0,I don't mind getting fitter though! My partner used to comment he likes my back and arm muscles. I better maintain that lol ( not having any sex any time soon tho)
HLCommunity,fpa3jbo,t1_fpa38vc,1588440083.0,"Thanks so much. I realize my libido is not triggered. It is just there. When I am at work it is easier but during the lockdown it kills my sleep and my attention. I might just journal it to keep myself occupied. Thanks, as I really didn't think about logging it at all."
HLCommunity,fpa2c0m,t1_fpa1yg7,1588439388.0,That actually sounds like a difficult journey too.
HLCommunity,fpa1622,t1_fp9zi2k,1588438725.0,I usually go to the gym but the lock down is not allowing me to.
HLCommunity,fpa1421,t1_fp9yklx,1588438692.0,Thanks for this. I am wary of the side effects too. Sometimes I wish I don't have HL.
HLCommunity,fpa11y0,t1_fp9yhl9,1588438659.0,I am struggling because I cannot focus..... Like my Brain will drift off to something else.....does that happen to you too?

uksucculents,fnaggfw,t1_fnaga2n,1586797074.0,Ah~~~ that's a very different plant! Just googled it and it looks good when grown!!
uksucculents,fnaf33q,t1_fn9rgsk,1586796388.0,"I believe we have the same one. I have a small one too, but not the variegated one. It will take some time to grow into a small little cute tree."
uksucculents,fn9r091,t1_fn9qvt9,1586782325.0,I am Curious now. Can I have a look? I don't know how you can share an image tho lol
uksucculents,fn9osbu,t1_fn9o8cp,1586780508.0,"Hi, yes I was referring to that one too. Please see:

uksucculents,fn9o0zc,t1_fn9njh5,1586779847.0,That's a variegated cotyledon tomentosa. If I am wrong please let me know. :)
uksucculents,fn9lls8,t1_fn9lhlm,1586777565.0,"I forgot about water propagation! I might cut two branches and try one with water and one with compost :)
It is spring now (we can have four seasons in a day rn) so I might start that now but leave them indoors."
uksucculents,fn9l87j,t1_fn9l4n6,1586777185.0,Thank you. I will try that.
uksucculents,fn9l6ss,t1_fn9l1bp,1586777146.0,I only have one leaf that has rooted among many. I was wondering if cuttings instead of leaf propagation will be a better way to do it.
uksucculents,fn9kz6r,t1_fn9kwpw,1586776931.0,Did you cut it and left it lying down?
uksucculents,fn779me,t1_fn72lq9,1586714662.0,"My one in the picture is actually in the UK. I absolutely understand the challenges you mentioned! Tbh I cannot relate more. I keep it indoors next to the windows so t
It gets light. I also have my lights on so it gets light through winter. The room temperature in winter is warm if you have your heaters on so they won't go to sleep. Others on this sub also suggested using grow lights. For flowering it depends on daylight hours - most plants sense the pattern of how many hours they receive light. So when days become longer they will bloom, and then they need a period of short days, and they when spring comes they bloom again."
uksucculents,fmxtc82,t1_fmxrpxo,1586471474.0,Yes they are flowering plants.
uksucculents,fmwe7b9,t1_fmwcojl,1586444969.0,I believe it is Echiveria apus.
subnautica,fmjfpqj,t1_fmjeeg4,1586129407.0,I should have tried the propulsion cannon before I reloaded it! Can I make the base fly lol?
subnautica,fmj8ewn,t1_fmj878k,1586125137.0,That's not my base. It is a base of degasi lol
succulents,fmhp1qt,t1_fmg7nzf,1586088981.0,That sounds do professional. The temperature ranges are really helpful. I haven't measured the temperature at all. That's is absolutely something that I can do. Thanks! It is very helpful.
succulents,fmfpzdn,t1_fmf95os,1586032434.0,Thank you for that. I have been thinking about having a greenhouse with grow lights inside. It is a very good idea. I guess a lot of people in this subreddit have those already. Are you finding the greenhouse useful? Does it help when the climate is in general cold? I assume your greenhouse is outside?
succulents,fmf4dn3,t1_fmes98l,1586019693.0,Oh thanks. I might try that. The only concern is killing the plant completely when there are no leaves. I live in a cool and cloudy place so I am slightly worried.
succulents,fmel8uw,t1_fmekye2,1586007353.0,Oh i see
succulents,fmekn6j,t1_fmejj9b,1586006856.0,I don't think it will grow from the centre again. It looks dead
succulents,fmekm4w,t1_fmejfl9,1586006832.0,Thank you. I might remove all the leaves on the top when the babies are bigger and more viable on their own
selfimprovement,fm1wmzr,t1_fm1vh2h,1585686340.0,That's true. And I really like your idea of starting with something small. I should start doing that.
selfimprovement,fm1uot3,t3_fsj9zd,1585685335.0,Thank you for your reply. Getting permission from myself is hard. I hope you have managed to get that!

selfhelp,fdrmnp7,t3_emtf1m,1578686707.0,"I cry at least once a week - there is this sadness that wants to come out. 
I have three things to share:

1. It is ok to cry. It seems that you have associated crying with being weak, but maybe I am wrong about that. Crying is a human response to cope with stress and trauma. There is nothing wrong about crying.

2. get some quality solitude without your phone or the internet to calm down and think about what is causing you that stress. The world now is full of distractions. I suggest you to cut down distractions to clear your mind.

3. Talk to people whom you trust and care about you when you are ready to explore your feelings or have questions.

Good luck.  I am also working on myself so I am no expert. These are a few things that I tried and worked for me. It might or might not work for you. I hope things get better soon."

Insurance,f138135,t1_f131y97,1569156333.0,"I understand. I was really surprised when that happened because I honestly didn't see anything on the side.
Insurance said I did the maneuver so it was my liability."
Insurance,f12hnko,t1_f1102yq,1569140544.0,"If I hit the front, it will make sense because I must have changed lanes without checking mirrors and then a car came and collide with me. We should both have damage at the front/side.

But it is damage to the middle of the carï½ž the car was also tall and big. What are the chances.of not seeing it when looked into the mirror? 

I am wondering what would insurance do when they can't proof who is at fault?"
Insurance,f12h8tb,t3_d7ijhe,1569140362.0,"Thank you for the comments but I am trying to make sense out of this. Insurance will probably not be able to find out who is at fault. So what's next? 

Also logically it doesn't make sense to me coz the car came out of nowhere."

Eventually she agreed to cut it back, but I still aim to maintain the amount we agreed before. I think not paying any will be another big argument and guilt inducing event. I will try my best to fulfill responsibilities."

relationship_advice,eptgt2r,t1_eptga97,1559489896.0,"I hope she does nor escalate, if that's the case I will be super worried and guilty.

Oh it is an expectation to send money home. It is a gesture to show that you still value the family perhaps. Currently I try to send 19% of my monthly income home. I can still pay rent and afford a car atm. But ofc I try to save up as well. Therefore I work extra hours."
