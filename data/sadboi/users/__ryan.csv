It really doesn't matter that you haven't had a boyfriend, maybe when the right person comes into your life you'll feel different but no one is alone in this world."
classicminis,fkp1avr,t3_fjsa0p,1584399555.0,"Best to declare all known mods, but I guess that some can be classed as optional extras. On a ¬£250 mini at 18 with similar mods  many places quoted me ¬£3000+ in London (over 10 years ago). I think for the first year I ended up fronting on a policy with my parents to get that down to around a ¬£1000. I think Adrian Flux are usually pretty good with modified Minis. Good luck."

Perhaps there is a counsellor at school you could confide in?"

londoncycling,evjkzx2,t3_ck4yrz,1564564575.0,I took a girl out in London on Sunday and I noticed some of this for myself (mostly bus drivers and black cabs) and as she's not from London I made sure I was defensively riding for 2. For the majority of the time I would make eye contact with drivers where possible.
abarth,evd5wlu,t3_cjc37u,1564430823.0,"Pros - looks, character and personality, not boring, lots of different configurations so you never see the same car too often, rarer than other hot hatches, sensation of speed, sound, aftermarket options, small size and low weight for a modern car

Cons - build, reliability and scrapes, considered a girls car (idgaf)

I have an esseesse with 17"" wheels and live in an area with many speed bumps and potholes, it's tolerable but I don't use the car often. I have a high mileage example and I'd say it's actually not done all that bad considering it's reputation.

TLDR Just buy one; no regrets."
