mentalhealth,fqsvspu,t3_gkl4m6,1589620662.0,"I completely agree with you.

It also goes to show how bad the nation of America has become considering they voted for him in the majority. 

Very saddening indeed."
mentalhealth,foy7tqy,t1_foxqda1,1588167258.0,"Very true, it's a balance and we have to look at both sides."
Anxiety,foxvl0x,t1_fox9pfg,1588157779.0,"I definitely do understand where you are coming from, I guess I just took a chance as I have been struggling with gaining traffic, which doesn't mean I don't want people to benefit of course. I apologise if I have caused any offence to anyone and yes I am a undergraduate psych student."
introvert,foxvcgc,t1_foxqyex,1588157546.0,"Wow, talk about twisting this on me, you are the one who brought up 'mental health problem', in fact I think you are the problem with all due respect. I never said introversion is a mental health problem at all, The title says Mental Health Blog, it doesn't say anything about bad mental health. It's people like you who assume mental health is always referring to negative connotations, it can be positive mental health too. Don't assume."
introvert,foxnfbw,t1_foxk1rd,1588149638.0,I would need to do a bit more research on whether it is a Mental Health problem as such but definitely introversion relates to Psychology so I posted it here.
productivity,fox8aj8,t1_fnxv88d,1588136580.0,"Yeah, I see your point. I have been trying to let people know about my blog about Mental Health but never been quite sure whether it will be taken seriously but I try anyway because you gotta start somewhere I guess.

confidence,fox7fjw,t3_g9sjbd,1588135953.0,"I would suggest analyse your 'weak' points and write them down. Every day focus on trying to strengthen those weak points by practicing them again and again. Whether it be talking confidently, walking confidently, anything, just practice. I currently have a blog at the moment which is about Mental Health and confidence is something I may be blogging about soon, so do check out the content.

Blogging,fox4uay,t1_fouxvct,1588134101.0,Yesss! I too have posted my mental health blog on several subreddit but become confused as to whether I'm doing the right thing
blogger,fo3z7ad,t3_g5gqcs,1587495457.0,"Wow, just a question, how comes the left picture is black and white when in 2001 they had coloured pictures?"
blogger,fnjfeem,t1_fnh6l7i,1586997859.0,I see. Thank you for this advice üëçüëç
blogger,fnjcrze,t1_fnidbol,1586996366.0,"This seems really interesting, I'd like to know more about it please. üëçüëç"
blogger,fnflsa3,t1_fnfemm4,1586910589.0,"Thank you, it's made by Wix in fact, good layout and services however on a separate note, once I had made the website and paid for it, I had found out it's an Israeli owned company and considering the mass ethnic cleansing taking place there of the Palestinians, I felt really bad and unethical, tried to refund, was denied a refund, so now I'm rolling with it til the subscription finishes but ANYWAY I have digressed.

That information you have provided regarding affiliate links is very useful and yes haha I can see you speak very highly of Anastasia Blogger. Also, is it a good idea to include a social media section on my blog site where it shows my various feeds from Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest etc?"
blogger,fnfb6od,t1_fnf5ddc,1586904770.0,Much respect for this reply Mick. I shall have a look at the video you have sent. Thank you.
blogger,fnfar8q,t1_fndk46p,1586904553.0,"Thanks for that clear and concise response. I will definitely need to start Pinterest properly. I've made an account and everything, just haven't put any pins up yet because of lack of knowledge about it. But I shall do some more research. My blog is (https://www.ameenscanopy.co.uk/). Do you know if there is any point of having affiliate links at all?"
