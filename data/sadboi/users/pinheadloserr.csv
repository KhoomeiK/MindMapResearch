There are comments in this sub CONSTANTLY wondering if that sub is serious or not.

I worked as a customer service manager for years and I know from my own and my employees experiences that slapping on a fake smile day after day is genuinely depressing as fuck and exhausting. Especially with ""the customer is always right"" expectations people have when interacting with service workers.  Most customer service workers that we interact with on a daily basis are on their feet all day, constantly being berated/talked down to, and making shit pay. Hardly a day went by where one of my employees didn't get some rude or inconsiderate treatment, which they were expected to smile through. I'm not going to judge their service based on if they're faking a smile to me or not."
