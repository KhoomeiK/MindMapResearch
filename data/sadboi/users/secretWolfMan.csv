Your body is sending signals to do lots of fever making muscle work and also signals to lay the fuck down and stop moving so you're not wasting energy.

If your name is not on the lease, and you are not the ""official"" renter's spouse or child, then you are a subletter/subtenant and they have the right to evict you (eviction terms will vary depending on the local laws)."

My wife jokes that I only have two types of sick ""yeah, I felt a bit tired and stuffy the other day"" and ""I think I'm literally dying"".  The ""I think I'm dying"" happens about once every three or four years."

NoStupidQuestions,fqps136,t1_fqpqt4m,1589552894.0,"YES.  We clearly have a misunderstanding.  Our dialog is not purely focused on interactions with police, but police are trained to use the same language skills we've been discussing.  (see how that feels calmer and less accusatory than if the ""we/our"" was a ""you/I"")

""What are you doing?"" will 100% of the time result in ""nothing, why?"", and then a drawn out conversation where you have to coax them out of a very defensive position just so you can learn that they weren't actually doing anything wrong.  

""What are we doing?"" has a chance, even if it is tiny, to elicit trust and the speaker is taken into confidence more easily.  ""Hanging out, waiting for my friend to finish class."""

It's either ""inclusive language"" or ""deescalation language"", maybe it's a trick that works in both.  

Saying ""you"" makes a person defensive.  Avoid it anytime you want someone to be on your side.  ""I"" and ""we"" statements help people empathize with you and feel more safe because they are not being isolated."

If you don't have one already, get a waterproof mattress liner for under your sheets.  Your bed is probably like a giant kitchen sponge and full of mold and bacteria.  Actually, get a new mattress and a waterproof liner.  

Also, mention the frequent night sweats to a doctor.  You could have a thyroid or other metabolic issue that can be treated if you catch it early."

It can be used with a sarcastic or condescending tone, but that's on the speaker.  And the inclusive language is still going to elicit a better response than using ""you"" with the same tone."

If one partner keeps a secret and uses it to scam the others out of their money, that's a shitty thing to do.  Since the SEC organized the partnership, the Federal government could be liable for the losses.  So they made it illegal to scam your business partners by acting on non-public information."
