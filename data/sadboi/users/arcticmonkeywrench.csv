The first to have the internet and the cell phones.  The first to have a GPS and a voice telling you where to go.  The first to do homework on a laptop.  The first to have all the information in the world at their finger tips.  The first to socialize via email, text and skype.  And the first to have meaningful relationships with people they will never meet in person.  Y represents the future.  I have high hopes for Y shaping our world into a tolerant, inclusive, and very fucking cool place!  They are both equally important.
