All this things are permanent and change fast making it impossible to catch up with them. But why catch up? 

Unfortunately life is probably meaningless. God knows why we are here. But here capitalism fills that hole and provides society with things which are supposed to be meaningful but in reality they are not. 

But we have a chance to create our own meaning ( here I refer you to Camus he's better at explaining this point than I'm )

I'm also 22 and have had depression since 16-17.

Life has become very weird now. It's surreal and I'm under a dome or something, like in that book, ' The bell jar' .

I can't truly connect to anyone, as if there's a wall or something. Every social interaction has become a burden really.

As for like other things, life now lost it's meaning and it makes me feel so empty. Like some force suck up all my inner strength and any positive emotions, good memories and left me with nothing at all. Things I used to like doing like reading, learning foreign languages and generally striving for knowledge just dissapeared. 

I feel numb. Never really able to understand reality.

Plus I've become more unsure of myself then ever before which results in not taking opportunities. There was an opportunity for me to go to Germany and increase the level of German language (you learn and have a great time, sounds good, right?) and I said fuck it, I don't deserve it, not good enough for that.

Summing it up: I'm just numb and empty. Numb and empty.


Advise that I would give is I guess one should stop relying on hope that life will get better. Sadly it won't.  It will probably become somewhat bearable enough. And you can make it bearable here now without putting it off by doing little things , step by step, getting rid of something which doesn't make sense."

minimalism,eww613u,t3_cqftep,1565821301.0,"Hello there! 

My journey started not so long time ago with the book ""The more of less"" and the movie ""The minimalist "" - totally reccomend for reading/ watching at start of your journey and rereading/ rewatching, because there're lots of misconceptions about minimalism on the internet.

Currently reading a Marie Kondo.

I'm 22 y.o. now, live alone, from Eastern Europe. When lived with my mother couldn't help but notice she never throws anything away and always says something like "" We might need it later"" and so on. She's in her 60's now and a lot of people of her age hold to this idea, just like people around 30 y.o. As for younger people, idk really, I guess we somehow manage to be in between these two ideas: keeping things just in case and buying stuff that's cheap, of poor quality and doesn't last long.

The reasons I've gone on this journey are different. The first one is because minimalism is good for my mental health. Having depression feels like you're losing control over everything, but minimalism with its ideas of decluttering and keeping only meaningful stuff makes suffering more bearable. Plus I can definitely say that owning less reduced anxiety to some extent.

Another reason is connected to environmental problems. Buying more stuff that doesn't last long and ends up in a dump field does damage.


Third reason is connected to money. Don't want to spend it on something I don't want.

Plus I come up to realise having more doesn't make me happy, only miserable.

And owning less gives some sort of freedom, like there're really a few things that hold me back when I decide to move to another place if not a country.

Wish you luck on your journey!"

mentalhealth,ewfzwus,t3_co4yw8,1565370855.0,"I deactivated Twitter many years ago. Got rid of Facebook and IG a couple of months ago. Now I use only messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram (this one mostly) to get in touch with the close ones. Never had Snapchat.

I haven't gone back to Twitter and Facebook but I have gone back to IG for a while only to realise that nothing has changed so far.

Using those social media felt boring with every post, tweet, and photo being just fucking the same. Even captions under photos are the same. That's why I started having difficulty telling various IG and Facebook accounts apart.

Also deleted accounts for the sake of privacy. That's why I'm more inclined to using Telegram now.

Another reason is that IG especially  would damage my mental health, providing unrealisitc and false expectations of life. Having used that, I would often chase that pointless goal of showing a better version of myself - because this is what everybody are doing there, right? But I never wanted it in the first place.

One more reason: I've started to living a much minimalistic life I guess. One of the key points of minimalism is to keep things which are meaningful and make you happy (that spark joy - that kind of stuff too really). And using social media for me now doesn't have much meaning and doesn't spark  joy.

There were many reasons that resulted in me being depressed. I've been trying to look back to search for them. The most obvious one is that I've never paid any attention to my own needs and desires. That resulted in doing what others wanted me to do, that's why now thinking about it makes me wonder if this is the reason why I feel so empty, as if I'm nothing but just a body.

minimalism,ev0n5i5,t3_chtqlo,1564142478.0,"I feel you, honestly.

My mom was born in USSR. And from what she's told me some things were difficult to get, including clothes, food sometimes. So I do understand how difficult it's for our mothers to let go of ""maybe we'll need it in future"" mindset. Sometimes I notice that I use this thinking pattern when I want to declutter stuff, or buy something new.

It is easy to say it's just hoarding but I believe it's not about that. Hoarding is something you can't control but in your case it's just a way of thinking,I guess, based on experience.

Here in Belarus, if parents and grandparents want to give a gift that you assume your children or you won't like, and won't use we just ask to give a sum of money as a gift. Proving it'll be better for all, since the ones that recieve that always know how to spend it right or just save it for something.

Is is possible to suggest doing that? I believe it would help both of you.

But anyway, you both need to communicate on the issue and be patient, since you both come from different generations and such differences are never easy to overcome."

mentalhealth,eulec9m,t3_cgue01,1563900261.0,"Not sure there're universal things to live for (ones that apply to all of us). 

Try to remember something that made you happy before, something that you used to enjoy and take small steps towards enjoying them again.
Try out new things no matter how pointless it might seem, maybe there will be something that you'll enjoy doing.

It's hard to tell whether there're any reasons at all, maybe there're none and society made us think there're reasons, somewhere, out there.
But I think it's worth trying to find them?

Apologies it the answer seems stupid. I am personally trying to find the answer to this question. Hope you find it too!"
depression,euh7zli,t3_cgh2lk,1563822457.0,"I've also heard different opinions on meds. 

For example, if the reason is only in not sufficient levels of serotonin and etc. meds might help just like when depression results in headaches, insomnia, lack of appetite- basically anything connected with your body. There're some meds that help you be more energetic and get out of bed to do stuff. 

But yes, if the reason of depression is in the surroundings, spiral of negative thoughts, negative events and some trauma, meds won't help much but make you feel as if everything is fine and won't solve the actual problem. 

Try to talk about that with your therapist, if they're professionals they will listen to you and change your treatment accordingly. Treating depression is never easy but every step counts and I hope you'll get better 🤗"
depression,euftohj,t3_cg9bv0,1563790365.0, I'm proud of you 💚🤗

That's a great question. I've been trying to solve this problem myself.  Totally understand what you're going through, asking that.

I guess one should cut them out from their life? I'm not insisting on that being good advice but at the moment I guess it might actually work?

Also, what do people mean when they say you're not trying hard enough? Do they mean you're not trying as hard as they try? If that's the case I think one shouldn't meet other people's expectations, especially if you go through difficult times.

I mean, nobody knows you better than you do. That's why it's probably better to have your own definition of what trying hard enough is. And if this definition doesn't match with other people's definition, it's ok, I guess. Since we're all different and have our own limits."
digitalminimalism,eubqwfg,t3_cfq8v0,1563654768.0,"I'm so happy to hear that you've managed to detach from social media for this long! 

I personally have my accounts on instagram and facebook deactivated for almost 2 months for the apps damaged my mental health and consumed to much of my time. 

Still struggling with youtube and messaging apps. I can't give up the habit of checking for new messages and watch videos that are not this interesting. 
I've heard there're apps that help track the time you spend on social media and tell when you've reached the limit you set. Started using one today, so far can't see it to be useful 🤷🏼‍♀️"
minimalism,eubn9ay,t1_eublh88,1563652176.0,Never thought about scanning letters! Thank you very much for telling me about that 🤗
minimalism,euba4nx,t3_cfn8om,1563643220.0,I usually spend one day a week to go through the stuff I own to see if I need it or will definitely use in the nearest future. The most difficult thing for me in this process is to get rid of the gifts from my family which I never liked. I know that the fact that I no longer have the gifts will upset them and for now I don't feel comfortable knowing or assuming that. Plus there are old letters from friends. I haven't communicated with  for a long time but I just can't make myself throw the letters away
