I don’t think I was showing any signs of depression before the experiences started. Mom pointed out a few times that I used to be the most extroverted person she’d ever met. She figured the introversion just came with age, since she was in so much pain from surgery that she didn’t remember anything from when I was 10-13., including a school shooting I survived when I was 12. My guess is that stuff started happening when I was ten, after Mom got the surgery. I have a feeling a lot of what developed was trauma-based, especially since a lot of traumatic events and memories of them  followed me for half my life (from age 10-21, had one really awful friendship until this past fall) and the especially traumatic stuff hit right at the puberty mark. I think getting out of the environment where all these bad things happened and getting myself to open up to others about it was a big step in recovery even before the meds. I only go back for occasional weekend visits now (when pandemics aren’t happening)."

mentalillness,fqu92st,t1_fqu5p83,1589654401.0,"Thank you so much! I was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder about a year ago. The reason I was so ignorant and bottled up about it was because I came from a community that didn’t believe in or teach mental illness. I was far from the only one with a mental illness, but others affected would expect guidance and an emotional panacea from me. I stopped taking care of myself because of a combination of keeping my friends alive and my grandmother blaming me for my mother’s surgery-induced disability (she had vaginal mesh insertions to keep her bladder from falling out. I was the third of four children, and they suspected having too many kids caused the initial problem. The mesh inserted was not tested on vaginal tissue, and they refused to remove it until threatened with a lawsuit). 

When I got to college, I cut off the toxic friends and got a much better support system. I moved in with my boyfriend and his parents with the excuse that I need to take classes online during quarantine, and my house at home doesn’t have WiFi (which is true). I wasn’t adapting well to the lockdown, but I was surrounded by people that actually cared about and listened to me. I’m glad I escaped, because my high school is still conducting their 2020 graduation (My also-disabled brother’s senior year) in person. I’m safe, but no one else in my family seems to have any qualms with it. My greatest source of fear right now, with my disabled mother and younger brother AND my asthmatic older brother that still has to go to work in person, is that they might catch the virus and at least one of them might die. And they might throw a hissy fit if I don’t go, but my boyfriend’s mother is on Humira, so if I leave and risk my own life, I can’t come back to an environment that’s actually loving without risking her life. 

Of course I’m scared, but I’m looking at how far I’ve come in terms of my own mental health recovery and trying to find a silver lining in that. Finding a support system and seeking help in the first place unconsciously opened up the doors I needed to frankly survive. If COVID had hit while I was in high school, when my depression was thrice as severe as it is now, I likely would not be alive. I’ve come to terms that this is something I will have to continue living with, but the plus side of that is that I’m consciously deciding to continue living, hard as that may be sometimes, and still on the fast track to a successful acting and Playwrighting career."

My bf is a disabled man himself and wanted to be able to properly represent the community as such. The reason Shakespeare wrote Richard the way he did (as in affirming all rumors about him were true) was because his plays were always presented for the King’s Court. The Queen Elizabeth he was presenting this to was Richmond’s granddaughter. Shakespeare was very much pandering to that audience that saw Richard as a demon because he had severe scoliosis and Richmond as a hero for his claimed slaying of him that ended the War of the Roses. For those reasons, I can’t help but think Richard was a tragic hero mislabeled by an ableist community that believed he should have never been born."
