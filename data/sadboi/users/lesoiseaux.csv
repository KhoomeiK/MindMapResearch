It was the worst moment of our lives and has made my anxiety skyrocket.

We have another dog now and, although we have implemented so many systems to prevent that from happening again, I am extremely paranoid. If my husband takes a little long when he lets her out in the morning, I start panicking. Any time we have people over, I just want to lock her in a room the whole time so there's no way she'll slip out. Of course, I know that's not good for her socialization, but I become obsessive about her safety to the point where no one is really enjoying themselves.

It's almost been a year since then. We have a new dog now and I've become incredibly anxious and paranoid that something will happen to her. I have been meaning to find a grief therapist or general therapist to help me manage the unknown. It helps to talk about the good times with my husband since he's the only other person that feels the same pain. Sometimes joking about the silly or annoying things your pet would do helps to lighten the mood. It takes time. I would encourage you to let people know that you're struggling with the day to day stuff and see what can be adjusted until you've had some time to grieve.
