Idk if I mentioned but I‚Äôm a pharmacy tech so that‚Äôs why the pay was that way. I think the front gets like $12.50 if ur not a lead at CVS.
WalgreensStores,fo8zuj5,t1_fo8zky6,1587607378.0,"Yes. It‚Äôs $10.10 in CT, CVS starting is $14.50 I believe now. I was with the company like 2.5 years. I was about to get a raise before I left (like $18 or close)  but I had to leave for personal reasons."
WalgreensStores,fo8xn6l,t1_fo8x3ma,1587606008.0,I‚Äôm also new (like 7 months) but I asked for a raise recently and was told I couldn‚Äôt get one. I was working at CVS before getting paid $16 hourly. Walgreens pays me $12.50. I took the job just to be working but now I‚Äôm very unhappy with how underpaid I am.

apexuniversity,fmz0k7n,t1_fmz0h23,1586501918.0,I mean if you‚Äôre learning the game mechanics it‚Äôs not really a you thing. You‚Äôre still learning. When I started the game I killed my KD because I didn‚Äôt know how to play it but now it‚Äôs significantly better. Once you feel like you got a hang of the game you should ask for tips.
apexuniversity,fmyru30,t3_fxzqaa,1586493889.0,"While I do agree that some posts on here are like that, I think it‚Äôs also good to post your best clips in where you might‚Äôve just gotten lucky. For example, the clip I posted here I had like 12 kills and won the game but I wanted to know what I was doing wrong still. It happened to be my movement. I have improved from that clip with it and I crouch more often and win more 1v1 fights now. So it‚Äôs not all like that you know? There‚Äôs always room to improve."
apexlegends,fmrlw34,t3_fx0xl2,1586327286.0,Yes that‚Äôs why I just stopped playing

apexuniversity,fmoeu8w,t3_fwcwdc,1586256431.0,You could‚Äôve crouched or moved side to side while aiming. I watched your clip like 6 times and you had him one shot. You knew he was coming before he knew where you were exactly. You need to utilize that to the best of your abilities. It‚Äôs usually how I win 1v1.
apexuniversity,fmoepij,t3_fwdb2x,1586256291.0,Consistency matters just because you can always further improve with one legend instead of rotation. I mainly play with lifeline and wraith and whenever I use lifeline I try to phase which often gets me killed lol. I usually split between both if I‚Äôm playing for hours but it‚Äôs not that big of a deal who you‚Äôre utilizing as long as you remember who it is and how to use them appropriately.
apexuniversity,fmoek50,t3_fwhuhh,1586256131.0,"The kicking door animation does not allow you to move all that much. I think slightly. Always keep a thermite, it‚Äôs better anyways."
apexuniversity,fmoef87,t3_fwdf1e,1586255982.0,In high tier play it‚Äôs very risky to do. My squad is very aggressive so we push most things but I always get yelled at for performing finishers because I get knocked because of them or I almost get knocked lol
apexuniversity,fmoeauv,t3_fwdtxr,1586255855.0,I usually predict the circle by the game care packages
apexuniversity,fmoe889,t3_fwe4ru,1586255774.0,"Although you did good with the kraber you shouldn‚Äôt run with it as your primary. They could‚Äôve pulled up in front of you and shredded you because you wouldn‚Äôt have enough time to switch. Also, as soon as you heard shooting behind you, you should‚Äôve turned around.

She could‚Äôve just done browser lockdown which is a better alternative than some random person watching us the whole time. Not to say I cheat but people will find ways to cheat regardless in an online class. Like she purposely made it difficult.

apexuniversity,flavzdk,t1_fl9ur8v,1584992236.0,"As someone who hot drops often, gets theirs kills and revives their teammate consistently, I disagree. It has personally made me a better player and it can help the randoms improve as well. I have carried my team to wins numerous times, it‚Äôs just about how well your randoms can catch on to what you‚Äôre doing. This doesn‚Äôt apply to ranked, pubs only."
apexuniversity,flavht9,t3_fnga4m,1584991953.0,"I usually kill a squad by myself or take most of them out and then my squad decides to move with me. While I‚Äôm almost always doing wins over kills, I realize that my common mistake is moving too fast and randoms simply cannot keep up at times and then I end up getting mad at them for not getting there fast enough. I don‚Äôt use my mic to communicate however, I found its more effective with pings when it comes to randoms lol"

apexuniversity,fjct1wh,t3_fcn526,1583235544.0,"To get more kills you need to drop hot early on and get those easy kills then rotate map and third party. Know when to back up from a fight and when to engage in one. If your teammates get knocked and they‚Äôre all dashing towards you, you need to back up for example. I got my 20k badge this way. Also, when you‚Äôre the last person alive it‚Äôs very important for you not to thirst your kills like that because that‚Äôs how they others will get you. This is why thermites are important to finish the job for you. Always carry 2.


Edit: I don‚Äôt mean legit drop hot but common areas like sorting"
