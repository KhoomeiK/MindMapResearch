Also US is the only country that’s really had major economic problems/recessions due to shutdown and that’s because we didn’t incentivize keeping people employed like they did in UK/ rest of Europe. The problem here is 100% government not lockdown, seriously look into the bailout systems in other countries."

CoronaNC,fpm1uo6,t1_fpk1eox,1588723848.0,"Holy crap it’s STILL taking ten days? I’d think they’d gotten a bit faster.

I know they used to talk to me for like 5-10 minutes at the beginning but eventually just stopped calling. I got tested like second week of March for reference. My lungs still aren’t at 100% imo but that’s neither here nor there lmao

But yeah totally agree, I have no clue why they don’t close domestic travel. The smartest thing to do would be that along with requiring masks inside all businesses and tbh we’d probably be fine opening most stuff up based on the current research.

If it makes anyone feel better, some of the newer research is saying that outdoor gatherings are pretty safe as long as someone doesn’t like walk directly in your face and cough on you or something."

It definitely sounds like a great resource if you’re going through a rough patch or something but probably not the best idea if you’ve had chronic mental illness for years.
CoronaNC,fpjn2zk,t3_gdrhux,1588674625.0,"Uh you do know we’re not reopening on the 8th right? According to the press conference a few weeks ago they’re going to look at the numbers again and make another evaluation about whether or not we can start reopening.

Honestly, best thing to do if/when reopening starts is to wear a mask whenever you’re inside and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Also sanitize whatever you touched prior to hand washing, mainly the doorknobs/faucet you touched. 

I got tested back in March and the NC health department gave me this packet about how to keep your family safe/disinfect your house and that’s basically the TL;DR. IDK why they haven’t released this stuff publicly, I’ll for sure take a picture if I can find it."

I’m really lucky that I was recovering from a high ankle sprain at the time and was taking Advil daily to keep swelling down. Everyone in my family presumably had it, and both my sister and dad have factor V as well. I *think* my dads on blood thinners since he’s in his 60s and has had clots before but my sister wasn’t taking anything. Miraculously, I was the only one who had respiratory symptoms. Everyone else just had a mild cough/headache that cleared up in a few days.

I was sick for around 3 weeks I think? I had the two stage progression where I got pretty bad around day 8. Was able to recover at home but when it got to the point where my inhaler i had for exercise wasn’t helping I went on clarithromycin+benzonatate and was told to pick up an oximeter to monitor at home. Lowest sustained reading i got was 93, my normal is 98. 

It was pretty weird to see how everyone in my family was affected differently. I think mine was the worst because I’ve got exercise-induced asthma and just objectively the worst lung capacity out of everyone but idk."
UGA,fpa87y9,t1_fp9ya4i,1588442794.0,"That’s not the case for the pic above tho. It’s probably shot at like 105 or 200 so you’ll lose depth for sure so the people in the back row will look closer than the people in the front row. But you’re not going to get such insane perspective distortion at that angle where 6ft looks like 6 inches unless the journalist was using a tilt shift lens for some wild reason. The best indicator is the two grads closest to the left side of the image b/c that angle on a zoom lens should be making them look a bit further apart if I’m remembering view camera correctly. 

Also like the sidewalk in front of the arch isn’t wide enough for that many people to be standing 6ft apart anyways regardless of distortion. That’s actually pretty far apart, like you and the person next you you should be able to hold your arms straight out and spin around without hitting each other if ur far enough away iirc. 

But yeah you’re right about that for some of the shots like the one of people crossing the street."

They both thought they were helping by encouraging me to “suck it up and get outside” and didn’t realize how bad it was to say that crap.

I’ve also found that it’s really helpful to explain it to people the medical aspect first.

Also before the mandatory shutdown of restaurants they called to let us know the club was just a GREAT place to hang out with your family and they’d hired MORE STAFF to accommodate “families with kids away from school” and encouraged people just to come and congregate in the area.

The thing that’s been so frustrating about DragonCon’s response is that to my knowledge they’ve made ZERO changes in how they’re planning on running the event this year minus saying they’ll wipe down doors or escalators. At the very least they should be severely limiting the number of attendees by not selling single-day passes,cancelling events like raves where distancing isn’t possible, and requiring con goers to wear face coverings. It just feels like they’re burying their head in the sand and pushing forward without considering the consequences yknow?

My honest reccomend action would be to sit down and talk with her to see if this is an isolated issue or not. I personally had a bit of a flare up a few weeks ago thanks to quarantine so it could certainly be related to that.

My recommendation would be to let her know that you expect her to actively work on mental health. Let her know that she can show you that she’s truly sorry though her actions, not words."

One time there was a guy who’d put his phone on a tripod and was streaming himself and some friends playing this obscure Japanese rhythm game called Museca on Twitch. Keep in mind, these games are free to play and it’s common curtesy to only play a single round before letting the person behind you take a turn. These guys just ignored the line and kept going because “it’s not like these people are any good at it”. He eventually noticed me waiting for a turn and begrudgingly moved aside while saying to his stream something along the lines of “Sorry guys! Some casual wants to play. I’ll leave my camera here so you guys can see a normie try this.”

Little did he know I was one of the best players of this specific game in the state. So naturally I selected the same song he’d just failed and completely destroyed his score. Afterwards, he just kinda grabbed his phone and left.

ptsd,fmw8ubl,t3_fxfh55,1586441967.0,"Yes it’s totally a trigger! But it also doesn’t mean you have PTSD. I’ve got trauma triggers and just good ol anxiety ones and both suck and are equally valid but are treated in two totally different ways. 

It may be because my ptsd is from an event, but for me the difference is that when I get a PTSD trigger its like my body has a visceral reaction. Sometimes I won’t realize I’m shaking/crying/acting weird until someone point it out. Anxiety/non ptsd ones are more internal if that makes sense? Like I can be outwardly fine but having a Bad Time? Idk it’s hard to put into words how they feel different.

Idk if this helps you narrow down whether you’re experiencing PTSD triggers or not since I’m sure my experience is not universal but either way just know that what you’re feeling is real and valid. If you have access to a mental health professional, I’d highly recommend asking for their take. If not, I’d say to teach yourself some grounding exercises as they help with all sorts of triggers."
ptsd,fmqknp2,t1_fmq0dyy,1586301492.0,"Seriously seconding this. Personally, it was really damaging to be called a hero cuz my brain would just automatically think of all the ways I could’ve saved more people/what I should’ve done better during the traumatic event. Some people may be cool with it but I dunno to me it always made me feel like crap. 

Just listen to what people are saying and validate their feelings instead of dismissing it as “but you’re a HERO”  from the get-go."
Coronavirus,fmn3b1u,t1_fmm3fg7,1586217312.0,Seconding this. I’ve seen hardly any change since the order came down and the only reason our cases are going down is they’re not testing people who aren’t admitted to the hospital. Like I hope this is true but honestly not too hopeful.
COVID19positive,fmmukg9,t1_fmjww6e,1586212364.0,"Also same. Had all those symptoms for a little over 3 weeks. pulse ox was 93-96 (normally I’m at 98) with the lowest reading I got being 88. Everything started clearing up around day 14 I think and I got on antibiotics shortly after which knocked it out p much.

Doctor thinks I had bronchitis and tbh I’m not sure if I would’ve gotten better without antibiotics, would recommend asking about that if u call.

On a weird note, I got a call today from the health department with “information about my test” a week after I was told I tested negative. Could be nothing but will update if it’s relevant."
COVID19positive,fmmtvwi,t1_fmmton9,1586211992.0,Thanks! Luckily things started to clear up once I got on some strong antibiotics :)
COVID19positive,fmmtmeh,t1_fmmd4ak,1586211843.0,"Nope, cleared up once I was able to breathe better. I ended up testing negative, docs say I just had bronchitis but with the 30% false negative rate who knows."
COVID19positive,fmmtc0w,t3_fw7bf4,1586211686.0,"Same here! I’m wondering the same thing too but my doctor says I likely just had bronchitis. Had literally all the common covid symptoms and almost identical progression with the whole feeling better than getting worse thing. Also tested negative for flu and strep. Good news is I started to improve very quickly after starting clarithromicin so maybe it was just bad timing after all. 

Weirdly enough, the local health department just called today to let me know they have “important info about my covid test” so will update if anything comes of it. It’s weird for sure especially seeing as I got results in a week ago."
worldnews,fml5n2z,t1_fml463d,1586179208.0,I’m in NC and they have changed the official testing guidelines so only people admitted to the hospital can get a test. [(source)](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/covid19/symptoms-and-testing/covid-19-symptoms)  It’s pretty standard now  in most places actually so uh idk where you’ve been.
Coronavirus,fm5yaao,t3_fsxzyj,1585782430.0,"Hey uh maybe don’t do this unless ur able to talk to a doctor (if u have insurance/are in a position to do that). I had all the symptoms and tested negative, turns out I got bronchitis after an asthma attack. I had to wait TWELVE days to start antibiotics while waiting for results/self-isolating. 

9/10 you probably do have it and everyone with symptoms should absolutely self-isolate, but please talk to a doctor first if ur able to especially if u do get a test and it’s negative."
roosterteeth,fm4lfmc,t1_fm4lbkl,1585756324.0,True. That was the only reason I could see for them not letting us know before hotels canceled first
roosterteeth,fm4l1uy,t3_ft1wr8,1585756124.0,I saw on the FB group someone saying they called the Hilton and they said it’s moved to Labor Day weekend? Idk if that’s true or not but i bet we’ll get an announcement tomorrow since it’s April Fools and they don’t want people to think it’s a joke.
quarantineactivities,fm2jhg7,t1_fm2hb7v,1585698731.0,It was so easy with her! We found her when she was super young so she was raised by our dog and has definitely picked up some of his commands. Hardest part has been getting her attention!
COVID19positive,fm0qpvg,t1_fm0q8mb,1585664260.0,"Thanks! It’s definitely a bit less terrifying when I have trouble breathing now that I know I’m not about to die! 

I may make a post about it to help alleviate some people’s anxiety about their mystery cough lmao"
COVID19positive,fm0ppd2,t1_fm0pkdy,1585663650.0,I found out yesterday that I just have the worlds worst timed bronchitis! I need to go through and delete some of my posts on here since I was presumed to be positive while waiting for results :) Just commented b/c I was able to get a test which is a bit rare.
COVID19positive,fm0lg8m,t3_fs5g7x,1585660857.0,100% yes. In the USA when I got tested the doctors wouldn’t let me leave until they verified that I texted my roommates. People that don’t are just selfish assholes and tbh it should be a crime
appstate,flyo5zq,t3_frgrci,1585605833.0,"From a student health services perspective, I personally had a very positive experience when I went in for a covid test on campus (negative, just terribly timed bronchitis). The doctors talked to me over the phone for almost 30 minutes before I came to make sure I needed one/would be able to get there. Was able to get a test that day and they sent me home with a MASSIVE packet of information about how to keep my family safe, resources to get grocery/medication delivery, and how to manage symptoms at home. All this was totally free under the student health program! Will update if I get a bill in the mail tho.

My only complaint has been the lack of communication regarding refunds. I’m not sure about housing since I’m off campus, but to my knowledge there’s no word on partial tuition refunds for certain classes or meal plan/parking pass refunds. But like other people have mentioned, this may be a UNC system problem and not an App admin issue."
COVID19positive,flo6zz6,t1_flo6qp0,1585332761.0,Same here! The waves are the weirdest thing ever!
COVID19positive,flo6u6r,t3_fpy9bk,1585332676.0,Mines been weirdly low for the last few days. I’m normally at 80bpm and now it tends to be in the 60s. The lowest I got was in the 50s last night. It’s super weird!
COVID19positive,flo6gr1,t3_fq1s8m,1585332479.0,"How often are u using your inhaler? I switched to doing 2 puffs every 4 hours religiously and holy crap my breathing is so much better. 

Hope you start feeling better soon!"
COVID19positive,flo66yt,t1_flnzdfu,1585332341.0,Heads up I also got tested in NC and it’s been a week and still no results. Hopefully yours has a faster turnaround but just wanted to let ya know so you’re not wondering what’s up like I am lmao.
COVID19positive,fllp50k,t1_fllj3p4,1585264918.0,"Family is bringing food to the door. I really wish I could make my own stuff but this is what I was explicitly told by health department people and since my parents are older I don’t want to go against what they said. To be fair, it was only supposed to be for a few days before this insane testing delay..."
COVID19positive,fllevz8,t1_fllesou,1585259011.0,Same! Thought I was the only one!
COVID19positive,flldzmc,t3_fpje1k,1585258524.0,YSS HOLY SHIT! The worst part was that only Advil knocks down my terrible cramps. I guess we just have the worst luck on the planet lmao
appstate,fll9fnm,t3_fpe3ev,1585256061.0,"Honestly, this sucks so hard. I’ve been dealing with p severe depression for a while and this past year at app has been the happiest I’ve been in a while. I miss my routine, I miss my professors, and goddamn it I miss being able to get out and be active.

I’ve probably got covid. I got tested at the health center 6 days ago and they still haven’t gotten the results back and it’s getting harder to breathe. I’m not allowed to leave my room or see anyone until i find out it’s negative or I feel better and I’m really not seeing an end in sight. It would be so much easier if I could get out of the house or exercise at home or something. It’s really fucking scary to have a new virus because none of the doctors know if I’m going to get better or get worse or what I should do about it. 

Sorry for venting so hard here I’m just honestly really scared and sad about losing pretty much everything that I enjoyed doing. Stay inside, this thing is no joke."
COVID19positive,flkte4r,t3_fpeujg,1585247330.0,"I’ve barely left my room since getting tested 6 days ago and that’s seemed to work pretty well since nobody in my family is showing symptoms. If I leave to go get fresh air or something, I’ll wear a mask and touch NOTHING. They really emphasized that I cannot touch anything outside of my room when I got tested (sadly this includes my dog) and honestly that’s why I think nobody’s caught it. It’s no fun at all honestly and I know it’s probably not what you want to hear but that’s the best way to keep others in ur house safe."
COVID19positive,flkiuv5,t3_fpdk88,1585241749.0,Still waiting on results from my test 6 days ago but I totally had that day 2 or 3 right before I started having shortness of breath/trouble breathing. would call a doc b/c even if you can’t get a test they can totally prescribe stuff to help with symptoms.
CoronaNC,fliqy8h,t3_fp20bn,1585188609.0,"I’m in the same boat as Mark. Like eerily. Also caught it in Jackson Hole and it’s been 5 days for me too. Would love to know so I can get treatment if it’s just bronchitis or something. It’s honestly getting ridiculous.

Idk if they do this everywhere, but I had to sign something saying I agreed to stay in isolation until my results came back. What I’m worried about is now that they’re not testing, people probably won’t know to do that and will just say 6ft away from family members which super doesn’t work."
CoronaNC,flhprz1,t3_fow1qz,1585167203.0,I was tested 5 days ago and was told the best thing to do at home is to pick up an oximeter and check your SPO2 levels regularly. Doc said to go to the ER if it’s under 90. Would highly recommend this so you/your parents have some warning before hospitalization is necessary.
COVID19positive,flh9ifu,t1_flh7zsp,1585158565.0,My state (NC) has just announced due to PPE shortage they’re only testing people admitted to the hospital. The location I got tested at performed a little over 100 tests for the entire county. I’ve been waiting 5 days for results which is insane. I really need to know if this isn’t covid so I can figure out why I can’t breathe lmao
COVID19positive,flh12ii,t1_flh0nse,1585154119.0,"There was a post this week that had some good ones, not sure how to link it on mobile. Ive been doing it to help clear out my lungs and increase blood oxygen levels, so that’s a good place to start! I looked up ones designed for smokers/COPD."
COVID19positive,flh0gtx,t3_foidle,1585153796.0,I can’t stress this enough. Please learn breathing techniques now so that if you start having shortness of breath you know how to do them and it’s less scary.
