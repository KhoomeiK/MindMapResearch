I hope it's okay if I send you a friend request then. I don't know %100 how it works, but I do know that it places a little red [f] next to your name when you post. I don't really pay much attention to usernames, so that would help me notice when I come across one of your comments.


Other than that, I should say that I haven't checked out Hunter x Hunter yet, it's kind of low on my queue, but I've kept it in mind."
mentalhealth,fna5890,t1_fmcocdo,1586791266.0,"I'm sorry for the late reply, to respond to your two scenarios though, I'd say yes and no to both? I wouldn't call myself a perfect match for either scenario.

The first one certainly happens, but it's rare for me. I'd say that it most frequently happens during stressful conversations. The most recent example that I can think of is my last job interview. The interviewer was telling me about the job, and I was fighting to pay attention to her, my mind kept wandering to the contents of her office and daydreaming about working there, worrying about screwing up. It's been a few months since that happened, and I can't really recall it happening since then.


Given how rare it is for me, and the types of conversations it occurs in, I'm willing to write it off as not part of ADHD.


The second scenario you described is really hard to tell. I procrastinate a lot and sometimes yes, I feel like there is a physical force preventing me from staying on task and being productive. It's hard to admit though, because I feel like I'm just using it as a way to not take responsibility for my own laziness. It doesn't stop me from doing the thing I ""*want*"" to do. Usually the thing I want to do is escapist, it let's me forget what I was trying to do and I can ignore it. If I do remember what I was trying to do, I'm usually screaming at myself internally to get off my ass and be productive. It feels like a huge disruptive force in my life, I feel like I can'g function normally.


This is why I don't trust myself to diagnose myself.




Thank you for sharing your experience with ADHD, hopefully it can help me to better understand myself with some further reflection. I'm try to be mindful of moments like the ones you described.

EDIT: I don't know who is going to read this, but I feel like after years of questioning my egg is finally cracking hard. It's not the first time it's cracked, but it might be the last. I don't know how much self doubt I have left in me after this long. Part of it is just the realization, that I have been subscribed to trans subs, trans creators and lurking in the trans community for so long. I've been going by the name Kate online for at least 5 years now, probably longer and that I've wanted to transition throughout all of middle and high school. The sheer presence that the trans community has had in my life combined with how long I have wanted to transition are making it really hard for me to deny it anymore. The truth is though, I still don't know what I am. 



I feel like if I had been born AFAB then I'd be on this same journey in reverse. I used to think that was a sign that I was cis, but now that leads me to believe that I might be Non-Binary. The truth is that I don't know anymore, but I'm pretty certain that I'm not cis.



I don't plan on coming out to anyone just yet. For now I'm planning an outfit to wear to pride, I'll see how that makes me feel. After that I'll probably book an appointment with a therapist if I can and take their advice from there.
