gaming,fqwop9b,t3_gldcoq,1589712277.0,Your choice is great and go for it.
MSILaptops,fqqdrnk,t1_fqqdo1a,1589563772.0,Thanks mate
cars,fqqcn32,t1_fqpuzhr,1589563218.0,It was a joke though wasn't it ? In my opinion Sam does amazing reviews and has amazing skills when it comes to videography and editing.
MSILaptops,fqq99ig,t1_fqq8yai,1589561570.0,Have fun mate.
MSILaptops,fqq8twl,t3_gk9bdx,1589561364.0,"First of all congratulations on your purchase.I'd say just use it for a while and see if the cooling system can handle the components. If it does throttle, you could try undervolting. If undervolting does not help then you could go for a repaste. Personally I would do it that way."
MSILaptops,fqlj9gi,t1_fqlgs68,1589459550.0,A cooler will also help. I undervolted mine using throttlestop but it also has 7 heat pipes that also helps to keep it cool. But the biggest change wss adjusting the powerlimits. Mine was at 220W stock I changed them to 60W and 90W. Now my temps never go over 85C.
MSILaptops,fqlh2e7,t1_fqlgs68,1589457900.0,If I remeber correctly the 75 model does have two fans right ? Try to undervolt you laptop and adjust you tdp. Im sure it will help a lot to keep it cooler.
MSILaptops,fqjqroi,t3_gj7liy,1589413839.0,I got 2512 with a -0.150mV undervolt and some tdp adjustments with throttlestop. Undervolting does work :)
MSILaptops,fqekp7k,t3_gi8g2p,1589309157.0,If you could tell what you model is that would also help. But I'm gonna say what I have experienced so far with my laptop. I played Gta V online and Witcher 3 on my laptop and the temps were hitting 95C which is okay but not good I also had the dragon center. Now I have undervolted my cpu using throttlestop. I did a -0.150mV undervolt to the cpu and -0.125 to the cache. While still using Dragon center my temps went down to 80-83C. So I would reccomend undervolting your cpu.
MSILaptops,fpok1i5,t3_gdwwlg,1588785807.0,It looks awesome. I love it.
pcmasterrace,fpfy4u4,t1_fpfi8b2,1588587891.0,I used throttlestop. Even though it looks like its complicated its not that hard and if youre not sure what to do there will be tons of videos on how to undervolt. I watched a video of Bob of all trades because he did a video about the exact cpu I have. The only thing that will be a bit tricky is finding the sweet spot of your undervolt. You might have to spend some time to find that. I used Cinebench R20 to benchmark my cpu and tweaked my undervolt accordingly. After undervolting my temps were improved by almost 20C°.
ContagiousLaughter,fou2jmr,t3_g9epek,1588074355.0,That' on the absolute edge.
pcmasterrace,fou2aqi,t1_fotoany,1588074144.0,Mine goes to 96 from time to time. Its good when its cold outside.
yahooanswers,fmg08ga,t1_fmdwzb4,1586038556.0,This needs more upvoates XD
MSILaptops,fjy7836,t1_fju7uio,1583691225.0,I didn't hear any beeping from mine though. Gonna try to reinstall the Dragon Center. I do hear the whine of the fans when theyre on cooler boost but not a beeping.
MSILaptops,fju6cse,t3_fesv8k,1583614009.0,I have the same issue with my GL63 8rcs. I think it has something to do with the new dragon center.
depression,firm9ks,t3_f99kdg,1582667066.0,Its always those little things man ❤
MSILaptops,fipn6jg,t3_f91j25,1582612575.0,Send it to the shop to repair its the better option imo. I'm  guessing ut still has the warranty.
depression,fhx12cn,t1_fhx0f3i,1581940379.0,Same
RoastMe,fhoqvba,t3_f3x9l0,1581770240.0,Yo is that snoopdogg?
MSILaptops,fft6n04,t1_ffsdl1s,1580209824.0,This looks like the case. It even has scratches on the side.
MSILaptops,ff5e6n9,t3_eri59w,1579589089.0,Welcome to the club mate
MSILaptops,f7cjd6z,t3_dv4kwg,1573593527.0,If your laptop is a GE63 there might be something wrong with your HDD. I'd suggest you to check on that.
pcmasterrace,f03xbw9,t3_d3iuxr,1568373621.0,Does he play classical guitar by any chance?
itookapicture,ettulxg,t1_ettt921,1563196496.0,Hopefully yes
