TheMidnight,fr31jf5,t3_gmam7g,1589848078.0,I listen to the Newretrowave youtube channel for my workouts and found sunset on their channel. There's something magical about these guys. There's no one else quite like them.

SkyrimMemes,fr0z6tc,t3_glviwf,1589810049.0,Good luck guys. We don't even have a projected date for Starfield. I can't begin to understand when TES 6 hasn't been out yet when skyrim sold as well as it did. Bethesda is really dragging their feet trying to save FO76 instead of moving on with something the fans have been asking for for years.
TheMidnight,fqzl0tg,t3_glr7o0,1589769605.0,I'd be down. We could have an open post about submitting bands. I'd like to keep it mostly this genre or stuff similar tho. Either way sounds fun

After the drop in stats from a Draco, a lot of people assume they can send in a mon and setup. I used to run EQ in gen 7 for heatran. Superpower works well this gen imo, especially when you can catch a random leech seed. Plus if you run seismitoad, you can always pivot in goods to take the grass move, get the plus 1 attack, and start hitting stuff."

Plus the diversity in OU was neat. Weather teams, terrain teams, stall teams, trick room teams and hyper offense sticky web teams. I could jump into a gen 7 OU match 10 times and see different teams. Not you literally see the same 4-mon most of the time. Creativity is at an all time low because only a handful of mon actually work."

They're really well fleshed out and super interesting as the series goes on. But maybe Filoni felt he needed Ahsoka and Maul to sell the show and gain viewers. I would read a series of books about Hera and Kanan. Wish I got more of them."
starwarsrebels,fprul04,t3_gf5voo,1588862331.0,"It gets better after season 1, but even then, it depends heavily on pre existing characters. I'll admit if it wasn't for Ahsoka, Rex, Maul and Thrawn, I probably wouldn't have watched it."
