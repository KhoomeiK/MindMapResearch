MadeMeSmile,fjixh63,t1_fjhfrum,1583378011.0,"I used to work at a shelter and it's a tad bit more complicated than just adopting out to anyone. My shelter had/has no application process. You can literally walk in and leave with a pet within an hour. We wouldn't refuse any adoption unless we had good reasons (the only time I ever felt the need was if someone was going to declaw a cat and I couldn't convince them how wrong me bad that was, which never happened thankfully, or a history of adopting and then returning multiple times. Even then management would probably still adopt to them.) but the issue is preventing returns.

Biggest demographic for returns? College kids and old people. Why old people? I can't tell you how many times I've seen old people adopt a puppy or kitten only to realize that puppies are the worst and take a ton of time and energy. And kittens are tiny murderers with sharp claws and teeth. My shelter took bites very seriously even if they were young. Old people have very thin skin. We got so many cats back for ""aggression"" because some old lady adopted some poor scared cat and thought they could force it to lay on their lap while they pet it too hard with their bony skeleton hands that they can't control well anymore. returning them because of the ""aggression"" the owner claims to be experiencing cuts their chances for being readopted in half or more depending on the shelter because most shelters will euthanize for bite history. Which I think we can all agree sucks balls. 

I do have to say though that I was fortunate enough to work at a really nice shelter with very stable funding (and as a non-profit too) with no stray population issues at all. In fact we had more issues having enough dogs to adopt out than an overpopulation issue. To the point we often shipped in dogs from other states to keep up with demand (and of course to help other shelters who aren't as fortunate as mine) which is a whole other thing kinda. 

There's more and I can go on if you want. But that's kinda the jist of the anger towards old people. I do wholeheartedly believe that anyone can benifit from a pet. However that doesn't mean every single person should have one. Old folks just tend to think that because they owned a pet once they can handle the same thing they did when they were younger. And it really sucks to have to go through the process of adopting out an animal and hoping to never see it again only to have it returned a few days later for stupid shit that we could have prevented."
AskMen,fjdxzo0,t3_fcnp7z,1583261417.0,"I lost 70 lbs (so far) from July 2019 to today.

BPD,fj0qc0e,t1_fj0kxo6,1582905576.0,"I totally understand what you're feeling. I've had the exact same thoughts. I feel like while this sub is great for being here, most of us are struggling too much with ourselves and having the same road blocks that no one has any answers. All we can do is updoot in solidarity and move on. Not to mention most of us freely talk about triggering stuff and maybe the few people that happen to be on around the time you post can't handle it today.

The only surefire way to get your feelings out and get constructive criticism is to get a therapist. And that's coming from someone who is too scared and broke to get one herself. But the fact is still true. You really can't rely on others to make you feel better or fix your problems. In the end we're all alone and it sucks but we just have to learn to cope with that no matter how painful it is.

There is nothing I want more in that moment where I'm deep into a panic attack than someone to walk in and be like ""hey, I'm here for you. What do you need?"" but I don't have anyone in those moments. So I just have to suffer.

And like I said I used to think like you to a t. And I wish I had better answers on how exactly you should cope with the loneliness. The only thing I've done recently that's productive is try losing weight. I was getting so extremely triggered from looking at myself in the mirror that I had to cover it up because I couldn't even pass by my own face. But I've lost almost 70lbs now and I'm able to start seeing some change and that's helped tremendously. I'm still struggling all the time and I'm for sure getting worse mentally because I don't have any other productive outlets. Hell, I'm doing intermittent fasting so you can even argue that my weight loss process isn't exactly healthy either. (it can trigger eating disorders) But it was something I could change so I'm working on it. And so far it's helping in that small aspect.

And that's really all we're searching for, right? If we can't be cured we at least want to know how to deal with it all. And sometimes that has to happen in baby steps. Find one little thing that you can change in your life if you just implement some kind of rule system. Something structured but not too strict. Like for me, the diet thing was that I couldn't eat for a set amount of hours. But when I could eat, I ate whatever I wanted. After that was too easy, I counted calories. Once I got the hang of that, I started working out a few times a month. Then a few times a week. And everything builds to be what you wished it would be and it feels effortless.

So yeah. Bpd sucks. Lol"

My favorite is when each thing is either connected or somewhat connected and you can't fix one thing without fixing another which you can't fix without fixing a third thing. But the third thing can't be fixed without fixing the first thing. And you're like great. Life is grand. Ughhhhhh."
BPD,fj0eq37,t3_fauu6f,1582898136.0,"I know how you feel. Bpd and most mental illness is hard to get others to understand what you're feeling. We're feeling such intense emotions that we don't know what to do about it and others can't relate so it's much easier to kinda close off.

I have a friend who I tell everything to pretty much and she's one of my first ""break down"" contacts but she's in a different state.

Lol but I have to let it go because I know she just doesn't know what to do either because she can't hear the static noise in my brain like I do. She does not and will never understand and neither will anyone else for that matter.

Also I don't know if you have this problem, but I can hide my crazy from everyone if I need to. I'll spend a whole weekend with my friends mid breakdown and they'd be none the wiser because I wear a mask and get as stoned as possible to dull myself down.

There is a lot of deceit happening with the food industry especially in America. There are a ton of studies claiming they prove artificial sweeteners are better than regular sugar.

If you consider how much money there is to be made off a population that is on average significantly overweight when you can say things like ""you don't have to give up those sweets you're addicted to (because we made sure you did) you can eat(buy) this instead!""

You'll also find that a lot of those artificial sweeteners are produced by the same companies that are manufacturing regular sugar.

If you're dieting, you should start trying to learn about all the different names they have for sugars and steer as clear of those foods as you can."

It takes way more self discipline than you think. If you're struggling with not fasting on weekends despite wanting to, then that should be your goal.

unpopularopinion,fgq9ea1,t1_fgpdkei,1581020315.0,"I've been fat my entire life. I'm turning 27 next month. My peak weight was 401. That was about 7 months ago. I've been dieting since then (intermittent fasting) and I've lost 55 lbs.

I've had mental health problems for years now and that made it incredibly difficult to stick with diets. Dieting is hard enough as it is for most people because junk food is so addictive and easy to access. it's so easy to be eating 4x your daily calories in just a few meals or snacks. Switching from that ""normal"" to any diet is a big challenge for most people. For example, I have to lose at LEAST half of my body weight to be a healthy weight. That kind of loss takes a ton of time and effort to shed. It's easier to accept my fate that I'm fat and always will be and that's that. Not to mention that my mental health issues make my brain scream ""kill yourself!!"" all the time so the prospect of eventually dying due to some obesity complication is a somewhat welcome prospect for me personally. The only thing really getting me to lose weight is that diabetes runs in my family and I'll definitely kill myself if I get that. Plus it'd be nice to buy clothes anywhere I want. 

As a fat person you kind of have to find a balance when it comes to interacting with the world. I think a lot about what and when people see me eat. I am constantly looking at my body in the mirror and judging it. I am very aware of how people might see me especially for job opportunities because I know my fatness makes me ""look lazy"" when that's far from the truth. But that's the thing. I HAVE to be a harder worker than my peers because otherwise it's really easy for people to say I'm lazy.

I'm not the type of person that needs a wheelchair or anything (thankfully), but my point is that fat people are very aware of how fat they are (usually) or at the very least know that it effects them negatively in society. Some people just choose to take the entitled route because fat people get the shit end of the stick no matter what and some people respond to that by being entitled to special treatment because they have medical issues besides the fatness that you can't see.

I think it's also important to note here that (in the US at least) obesity is typically a symptom or an after effect of other medical issues combined with the typical life style habits of the country. Or shitty genetics and American lifestyle like me. Or mental health issues. There's a lot that needs to be improved on the food market, society(economic mostly, poor people tend to be the most overweight. Don't think I need to go into detail why) and the medical /mental health care industry before we can sit here and blame fat people entirely for their fatness. We also need to remember that we're still technically new to this obesity epidemic and the diet industry is full of outdated, improper and lobbied studies. A big part of my taking so long to find a diet that works for me is because most diets are set up with the idea that a person is trying to lose those 15lbs for swimsuit season, not a girl whos been fat since the beginning of her time on earth, pretty much, who needs to lose half the weight she's collected. 

 And even then, if you're so fat you now need mobility devices to get around, most Dr's don't actually know how to help you because they haven't been taught how to specifically treat obese patients besides ""lose the weight and I'm sure you'll be fine."" again, obesity is often a symptom of something but Dr's tend to treat it as a diagnosis. You want me to exercise every day? My body can't handle that kind of stress because it's fat. Luckily I'm a millennial and I know how to use the internet to figure out how to do this in a way that works better for people like me. However, a lot of these wheelchair bound fat people are older and only get what advice they get from their Dr's, if at all, and if that advice is crap, what do you do??

So that's my soapbox. I'll go ahead and step down."

intermittentfasting,ffvs6bl,t3_evhlfk,1580271733.0,"I'm a firm believer in the slow go approach when it comes to trying to build a habit.

I did 16:8 until it was too easy then 18:6 and now I typically can fast 23 hrs or more if I just particularly feel like it. Don't need to prep or anything.

At the moment, I aim for 18:6 every day but with omad if my schedule allows it/forces it. So depending on when I start and stop eating I can fast for 22 hrs easy. My longest fast was 28hrs. All I did was eat first thing in the morning (woke up at like 4am)and then didn't eat again until the following afternoon because I had lunch plans. Sure I was kinda hangry at about the 26 hr mark but I've been doing this since June so my body is used to not eating as often now.

Practice makes perfect. You've made the decision to make this your lifestyle. You have your whole life to do this and it's going to work no matter how long you fast per day between 16:8 - 20:4. You may as well work your way up before you go too hard."

Cat genetics are really weird so it's hard to say if a cat that looks like a certain breed but came from unknown sources is that breed.

intermittentfasting,ff2zfsp,t3_er9dhv,1579529491.0,"It gets easier the more you do it. I've even felt kinda addicted to it a few times. I used to eat like 4k calories a day and the only thing stopping me was sleeping. I started at 401 lbs. I've lost over 60 lbs. In about 7 months. (last month was tough. Holidays kicked my ass) 

Some tips for the ""training"" period :

- start with 16/8. It's super tempting for people to go hard the first month. I promise it doesn't matter how much longer than 16 hrs you fast when you're just getting started. You're going to lose weight just as fast as anyone here. Shooting for more is great but too fast and you'll fall off the wagon. Your body adapts over time and it gets easier to do longer fasts. But you need to train your body to a) get used to waiting despite food being easily accessible and b) eating your daily calories in a smaller window. (if you used to graze like me this can be hard for your stomach to take). 

-start learning calories now. IF is still a diet. Unless you're doing a ton of activity and working out daily, there is no excuse to eat over your recommended calories daily.

-cut out soft drinks. Compleatly. Probably the hardest part if you're a heavy soda drinker like I was. But soda is incredibly addictive and the more you drink the more you want. And trust me you are going to want to squeeze every last calorie into your food you can for a while. You'll be sad you wasted it on soda.

-be aware of how much carbs you consume. Try to cut it in half and work your way down slowly from there. Like soda, carbs are addictive. The reason for this is that biologically we're programed to look for high carb and high sugar foods because they don't show up often in nature. When our Neanderthal ancestors were foreging for food it would be uncommon to find high sugar fruits for example so when you did, your body is like ""stock up now!!"" carbs and sugars stick around in your body for a long time so there's no need to consume it on a regular basis. Think of it like putting gas in your car. Figure out your tank size and fill it as much as you want but no more."
intermittentfasting,ff2xl5z,t3_era1lq,1579527839.0,"I started with 16 /8 skipping breakfast and that worked well for me. But when I started trying to increase my fasting window, I found that it was way too hard to hold back for longer periods of time. Especially if my lunch at work fell around 1pm on average and varied per day.

I switched to eating breakfast and lunch on 16/8 found it way too easy and now I typically do sometime between 18 - 22hr fasts daily. Doing omad on the longer days of course. 

Like another posted, life tends to make your window change sometimes and that's totally okay. The other day I did an unplanned 27hr fast and it was a breeze until the last hour or so because we had to wait for a table at the brunch place. Day after that I didn't even fast at all really. The key to those days is to just keep your calories to your respective daily need."
BPD,fezyeaw,t1_fezwp6p,1579463237.0,"Good question. I spent a lot of time hanging out in my car smoking and playing games on my phone.

I know I had in the back of my mind to keep things as trigger free as possible to avoid a bad trip. And I figured it would be a good idea to do it a few days after the panic attack because I'm usually much calmer after a panic attack because I build up to one like a volcano so once it happens I'm just numb for a while. 

I figured it'd be a good base slate to start with if I was going to be doing this in hopes of repairing some part of myself. And I think it did in a way. More stuff happened after the trip that would probably have made me spiral again but I was a bit more inclined to ignore it. If that makes sense. However I have no way of telling if this was from the trip or if I was still in the post panic attack numb still.

Obviously I didn't take the dose as a ""cure"" but there was a deliberate attempt to use it as a tool for introspection this time and I wonder if I just kinda self sabotaged myself somehow."
BPD,fezttnz,t3_er087y,1579461576.0,"So I've had a small amount of experience with shrooms. I've never really tripped super hard. The first few times I tried it I remember feeling really good for a few weeks after. Things were just brighter and lighter in a sense. It's been a while since I haven't felt depressed at least at some point in the day. After shrooms I felt like that cliud lifted. And my moods were a lot more stable.

So recently I tried a gram again after about a year since the last time. I had had a really rough week and a bad panic attack with plenty of self harm wounds to deal with. I didn't have a bad trip by far but as I was coming down I started to slip into a mood and self harmed again. Never got that feel good effect either.

So I'm not sure what to make of this for me personally. I'm very interested in this new idea of using shrooms as a medicine for mental illness and I fully support the movement to push more for it and experiment more.

I'll be doing more personal research on the subject for sure."

intermittentfasting,femm3y2,t3_epwfpx,1579262150.0,"It gets easier.
When it's not, try to train yourself to to wait. ""if I'm hungry in an hour, I can eat."" drink some water and wait an hour. Do it again in an hour or when you get the urge again.

I also recommend having your eating window nearly right when you wake up. I've found it's easier to tell myself to wait if I already ate first thing in the morning. Much easier to convince your brain that you're not going to starve when you've already had your calories for the day. I still sometimes get a rumble stomach in the evening but it usually passes after an hour or so. I've been known to just go to bed early if I'm craving food so badly at night. Can't mess up my fast if I'm sleeping!

Keeping carbs low in your diet will help a lot too. I suck at that aspect, but I do try to at least be self aware about how many carbs I'm eating in my window. No need to follow a keto diet or anything, but just generally avoiding carb heavy food will help you a ton both in self control and weight loss."

You know what I find helps? Doing one small thing that makes you feel nervous and doing it anyway. Like once I saw on next door that someone was giving away free merigold seeds but you had to come harvest them yourself. And I thought my grandma likes flowers and this sounds like a great out of my comfort zone situation. Let's do it!

So I roll up to this lady's house and I tell them hey I'm here. And they say cool take as many as you want! And I just started cutting dead buds and hoping I was doing it right and that no one calls the cops on me. it was the most uncomfortable thing ever. But afterwards I kinda had this sense of contentment. Like I just did this dumb thing and I feel kinda alive again. Like I could have just gone about my life and let my nerves take me away but I went and did it so fuck you brain I win again.

I guess my point is that bpd sucks the life out of you. Your brain turns into this mush of thoughts and emotions.then at the same time you play a game of tug of war with your brains instinct to survive and the idea of self destruction. trying to sooth all these different feelings while they scream at you in random waves is fucking exhausting. You argue that it would be better to be dead than fighting this forever. But your will to live reminds you that things might change if you hold out just a little longer. And idk. I'm lucky because I have the best cat in the world and I live to take care of her. I have no idea what will happen when she dies... She's my one reason not to do it. 

But you've got to tell yourself that you can always get another cat. Whatever it is that you've lost, there's something out there that can replace that void in yourself. Your bpd is just telling you that this is the one thing worth living for and when it abandons you, the world ends. But the world only ends because you will it to. 

But this is where I stop being helpful. I haven't done therapy. I'm fighting my brain on my own and I haven't discovered much ways to beat it entirely. I'm getting a bit better at controlling it through. 

Sorry if this was dumb. I'm stoned as shit right now and having my own breakdown. If you want to be breakdown buddies dm me. I'm about to pass out for the night but I'll answer as soon as I wake.

Think of it this way: in the Sims games the Sims have a bar that shows if they have a good relationship with someone or a bad one. Every interaction we have with someone moves the bar to either end depending on the interaction. Eventually something happens and the bar goes into red and now our brain is like ""that person is going to hurt you! Run away!""

It's kind of a crude way to put it but I hope that helps."
