worldnews,fqndnaw,t1_fqnd48y,1589492990.0,"I actually had to look up what that meant. I can assure you I’m on nobody’s payroll though. I just want citizens to be interested in what their own government is doing, rather than focusing on foreign boogeymen that the media likes to shove in our faces. It’s a diversion, I can see it for what it is. The China government is never going to go to war with us or invade us. We have a lot more control over the affairs of our government than we do China, and we should be distributing our attention accordingly. Don’t let them throw you off by getting you riled up over what other countries are doing."
worldnews,fqn0y5d,t1_fqn09w9,1589486824.0,"I get your point, and I was just speaking broadly not at you directly. I’m just saying it’s important not to turn a blind eye to our own government and what it’s doing. People who focus on and believe everything our state department and media say about China while ignoring our own government are being manipulated. A lot of the shit our media reports about our own government and lawmakers are mostly distractions too. All this stuff about impeachment or Russiagate or the latest beef between lawmakers is theater designed to distract people."
worldnews,fqmy7kp,t1_fqmuqaj,1589485512.0,"We need to be focusing on our douches in office. Anybody going after China is misdirecting their energy, time, and attention, and that’s exactly what our government wants. We can’t do shit about China. They are thousands of miles away and have nukes. We need to be paying attention to our own government."

NEET,fpu4ih5,t1_fpc22zo,1588904492.0,"It’s hard man. I try to accept that I need to play with the cards I’ve been given, but sometimes if I’m having a bad day that message just doesn’t work. Having loving parents is the anchor that keeps me living sometimes. I seriously pity those who don’t have that kind of safety net. They are in dire straits. 

I have a naive hope that I can better myself and find friends/a romantic partner, but progress is so slow that I get demoralized often."

Eventually someone at our store got sick and then they had no choice but to let us wear them."

MapPorn,fodjmfh,t1_fodj5id,1587685510.0,"There’s no guarantee they will. You would have to bring up that left wing economic policies would benefit people in the countryside more than right wing free market conservatism. 

Honestly the only way I see us getting rid of the electoral college is either through the NPVIC or a revolution. And even then you still have the senate, which gives small (rural) states a huge advantage in representation."
MapPorn,focuotu,t1_foct3ox,1587676134.0,"Cause you’re not going to convince them that a popular vote is good in terms of fairness or (my argument) because people in the cities support better policies. So then all you can do is explain why left wing policies are better for people living in the country side. Yes, I know rural people will never agree with urbanites on social issues like guns, abortion, lgbt people, but when it comes to economics, left wing people know better. But like I said easier said than done."
MapPorn,focsuub,t1_focspe9,1587675392.0,"So? You’re never going to convince them either way. If they ask why city people know better, explain to them how left wing policies are more beneficial to rural people. Easier said than done, though."
MapPorn,focsjpk,t1_focsbnn,1587675274.0,"Yeah that’s true, but they don’t see it that way. They see a popular vote as inherently unfair to rural people. So if you can’t convince them that’s it is a fair system, just say that the city folk know better, because it’s true."
MapPorn,focs399,t1_focqlbj,1587675098.0,"All the people who argue for the electoral college say otherwise, no? People in cities outnumber the countryside. Their advantage is a numerical one in a popular vote system."
MapPorn,focpl6w,t1_foag0vg,1587674199.0,"I’ll be honest. Rural areas are filled with uneducated people who will vote against their own best interests. I love democracy, but the people in the cities know better, and also....more people live there...so yeah I think the urban areas deserve their electoral advantage in a popular vote system. Just tell them this next time someone says farmers are more important or whatever."

politics,fk6ly83,t1_fk6hypl,1583906472.0,"You want the Supreme Court to vote in favor of working class Americans? Then organize and give them something to be afraid of. Intimidate them. Make them believe that if they don’t vote yes on Medicare for all being constitutional, that the country might fall apart and that their heads will be on the chopping block. You don’t get change by voting in semi-corrupt people who will give us semi-corrupt judges as opposed to fully corrupt ones. You get change by pressuring the people at the top. Change comes from the bottom up."

The US has done far worse in their lifetime, especially during the Cold War when the CIA was funding right wing terrorist groups around the world to stop the spread of socialism or any government hostile to American corporate power. 

And just because you think a majority of Americans will be untouched, don’t you worry that people in the Middle East might get hurt? All over some reckless decision? I think we need to be a little more skeptical of our government’s motives given our past"
