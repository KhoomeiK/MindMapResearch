PAXvapor,flor02q,t1_flo9ed9,1585343710.0,"I am buying a replacement regardless and it wasn't an emergency when I originally brought this to them.  I'm buying the Fierce. If they had ever bothered to show some support, I would have bought the new fuscia pax 3. Money talks. I await my replacement indefinitely at this point."
Seattle,fl2xb1m,t3_flzo8i,1584762387.0,"A) Pull out a tent and pop it up in the living room.  Make popcorn and watch a campy horror movie in the tent. 

Optional: own a hammock stand. Put up hammock, create a cross breeze, put on some island music, and pour a rum drink."
CoronavirusWA,fjycrl2,t1_fjxuxdl,1583694133.0,"Giving carriers ""time to escape"" is a really bad idea. I have family in Puglia in southern Italy, and see their posts. The president has urged people not to flee home south and stay in quarantine in a long heartfelt decree of sorts. 

Your ""me first"" escape mentality is how this shit spreads so far and fast and has become an epidemic. 50 have died in Italy alone amd 26 at the Kirkland care facility to date. 

Based on the care facility press release numbers  https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusWA/comments/ff1tdm/lifecare_center_kirkland_70_employees_showing/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

It seems like a few residents were pulled out of the home whom didn't show symptoms. Who really knows. That's from just the one facility."
BPD,fcrn8bf,t3_efgqu7,1577904024.0,"Yes. 

I don't have a family home, but I grew up in Tillamook county and sometimes I go do a drive down 101, visit my spots. The places I used to go to feel whole and find peace when life was upside down. 

I avoid visiting blood relatives when visiting home. It's allowed me to gather a sense of home without reopening traumas."
