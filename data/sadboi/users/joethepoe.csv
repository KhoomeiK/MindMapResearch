psychology,fr3d73o,t3_gma0zc,1589854883.0,Always been true
BPD,fqlvfpi,t3_gjfzwi,1589466802.0,"I don't know if I agree with this. BPD doesn't always stem from neglect in childhood. My girlfriend has it and yes she was a victim of abuse but I also have a friend with it who has had lovely parents both of which she considers her best friends. They were there for her throughout her life all throughout childhood. 

Neither of her parents have a personality disorder either to her knowledge so for her and many others it still remains a mystery. It's why psychologists aren't able to directly say yes, this is linked to childhood because while in half of cases it certainly is, the other half are somewhat or completely a mystery."
BPD,fptfse2,t1_fpsq5y1,1588890452.0,"It's funny you say that, I had that idea in my head but I thought I was being ridiculous with it so dismissed it! I'm going to try that and let you know how it goes because I know when I'm extremely down, playing a game seems to instantly lift my mood. 

Thanks, I will give that a try!"
BPD,fptfb6z,t1_fpssqc7,1588890205.0,"Thanks, I didn't think you could call the suicide hotline if it was for someone else but I'll do that!"
BPD,fpsi7xt,t1_fpsheqe,1588873904.0,Actually they had just started it but stopped when the quarantines happened so they're not currently receiving any. I did ask them to call but they say it's too difficult for them to talk to a therapist over a phone and that it won't help..
BPD,fpsfmj9,t1_fps3tr2,1588872657.0,"Sorry you've been suicidal as well. Yeah it's extremely scary and I'm unsure how to help them or what to do but I appreciate your comment, thank you"
BPD,fps3h4m,t3_gf6cwa,1588866830.0,"1. Give him space
2. Don't write a letter. Wait. Focus on you
3. After a few weeks have passed, reach out to him again


Go no contact, it not only increases your chances of getting him back but makes him realize you don't need him which should make him think wow she's stronger than I thought and if he loves you, this should make him miss you. This is also a great time to focus on you. Then when you talk again it will give you both the opportunity to start fresh."
BPD,fps2luf,t3_gf54as,1588866424.0,"I don't have BPD but my recently ex girlfriend didn't have a boyfriend before me. She's 24. She said the same as you, that she was terrified. She even tried to end seeing me several times but finally gave in because she said she never felt so strongly for anyone. I think it's normal for people with BPD to feel this way and I think with the right therapy, it can help a lot"
BPD,fps1gv0,t3_gf8khe,1588865884.0,"My girlfriend left me more times than I can even remember but she always comes back. I'm pretty sure that's a common thing when someone suffers from BPD. They are more sensitive to anything that sounds even slightly 'bad'. You can think you're being reasonable and neutral but even times when it's calm they can misinterpret a word or phrase and think it's negative. That's how my now ex girlfriend was. I love her to death but she always thought I was trying to hurt her when I showered her with unconditional love. It's not their fault, their reactions are expected since people who have bpd aren't like you or me. They aren't okay, that's the problem. But if your partner is hurting your cat physically, that's really horrible and I think you should leave him."
BPD,fprxa78,t1_fos2bgs,1588863781.0,"Thanks! Yeah agreed I don't owe her that, I just feel bad"
skype,fosog45,t3_g8m4u4,1588034759.0,Same problem
BPD,fomvlt4,t1_fomtxa4,1587905230.0,"Okay I'm sorry. Thank you for the feedback. She was the love of my life for four years and I didn't know she was unhappy with me. She would get upset and angry, break up with me and then act like it never happened. I didn't know we had a problem. Maybe you're right, I was the problem. I do regret not just agreeing with her on the girl's name because it would have made her happy and I should have tried the bacon dish and didn't bring up wanting to visit her brother that time because she didn't like it. Love is really about making the other person happy."
BPD,fomtghn,t1_fomqov0,1587903251.0,"Here is a list of arguments we have had

I didn't like the girl name she wants for our future children so I said I'm sorry I don't think I like that and she told me maybe we can't be together and started arguing

I asked if we could talk more and she got mad at me

She got angry with me because I don't eat bacon and didn't want to try it

She got mad at me for wanting to visit her brother when he asked us over because she doesn't like him

She got mad at me because I forgot my glasses at home when we were supposed to see a movie

She got angry with me for accidentally dropping a piece of the pie she baked

She got mad at me for talking to a female friend I bumped into while out shopping with her

She got mad at me for being upset with her when she didn't call me all day or night to at least let me know she was okay 


These are the arguments I can think of that we had over the past four years.

Tell me what I'm doing wrong? My tone of voice is quiet, that's how I speak. I never raise my voice, I never snap at her. I remain calm in how I say everything. I am trying to be as best a boyfriend I can be to her. I think she is done though. She doesn't seem to be interested in me anymore."
BPD,fom5d3a,t1_fom378d,1587878785.0,She has bpd. I don't have bpd and there lies the problem.
BPD,fom3ez9,t3_g78szo,1587877231.0,My girlfriend was sweet too until she turned on me and blamed me for everything. It's not going to be as easy as you think. Just a heads up.
BPD,fom1fqj,t1_folzgor,1587875715.0,I'm really not following you sorry
BPD,foly4p6,t1_folk0qp,1587873304.0,"Hm what do you mean by too invalidating?

Thanks"
BPD,folxji9,t1_foltqv4,1587872890.0,Thanks. I'm going to try and move on. I'm hoping we can both reunite when she gets treatment if it's meant to be.
BPD,folsy58,t1_fold6aw,1587869735.0,"I do love her. I wanted her to get therapy sooner because she has gone through suicidal cycles as well as self harm and her normal everyday isn't healthy. She is afraid of people in general, only goes out with friends after she drinks alcohol yep you heard that right. She will drink and then take an Uber when meeting her friends even just for dinner or shopping because without it she says she feels nothing. Luckily when we were together she didn't drink much at all so she actually was happy with me without needing alcohol to provide her emotions. I've bought her books to help her but she hasn't read any, nothing heavy just light reading that is therapy in disguise. I've kept nudging her to go to therapy but she hasn't started yet.

I'll have to remove myself from the situation because I can't handle her breaking up with me and act like I'm okay when mentally it's destroying me despite me wanting to be there for her. I don't know what to do because if I leave her completely she won't be well at all.

Thanks by the way"
BPD,fold5mp,t3_g83y49,1587859703.0,"My girlfriend with BPD split me. She's been having really terrible episodes and during one she split me and I'm still split black now. She isn't angry with me but she broke up with me because she said she can't handle arguments and that she can't forget them either.

We argue a few times a year. Our relationship has never been bad, only incredible and now she is only viewing the arguments.

I don't know if she'll come back or see us as good again. I've tried everything I can. Words, gifts, reassuring her everything would be okay."
BPD,fnr2czb,t1_fnr18tg,1587177628.0,Thanks but I know it's her bpd and I wouldn't say she's a toxic person in general.
BPD,fnqq6fo,t3_g3dh21,1587169810.0,This is how my partner is to me all the time and it's making me depressed. I think therapy is the only option for bpd. You're one step ahead of the most though because you acknowledge your actions whereas many do not. I wish you good luck
BPD,fnqpsq9,t1_fnqmsfr,1587169574.0,"Thanks, I really appreciate the help. It's been rough. The highs are so good but the lows are horrible. I never experienced anything like this sort of relationship before and it's definitely a struggle. I just want her to be okay. Every time she says she's leaving me it's incredibly painful and I'm left wondering if this time it's for real. I wish she could realize how I'm never trying to offend her."
LongDistance,fngj95b,t1_fnfqwfv,1586933993.0,Agreed. Someone could lose a loved one because of their selfish behavior now.
LongDistance,fngj4xw,t1_fneve0r,1586933886.0,"Exactly. I edited my comment too after seeing how others were so smart and honest in their comments. I wasn't going to bash the idea just to be nice but in all honesty, this is absolutely immature and selfish. I'd never say that so I was relieved to see how many people used their brains over their hearts."

Stay strong"

BPD,flj7njj,t1_flj5f2r,1585201580.0,"Thanks for that so I'm guessing this is more common with BPD.

Is that like a coping mechanism to immediately alleviate  emotional stress or are you genuinely angry with the people?"

So she ended things on saying that she doesn't know how to be with me if i move to the uk and she moves here but told me she can't be without me, that I'm the best boyfriend and her best friend. I agreed and said I don't know what to do... We're really stuck. It's not like our relationship is bad, it's actually unbelievably good and we always talk things through if we have a problem but this is big"
