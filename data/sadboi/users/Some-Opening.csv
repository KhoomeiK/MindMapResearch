Yes. Thats right. A modern linux distro is more stable than windows XP. While you may be trying to twist that disingenuously to make it appear linux cant compare with later versions of Windows 10, youre still proving my point about linux's stability, so thank you for that. Also, i never mentioned that the life support systems ran linux, I said, Linux is on the ISS which is true. Its not like the ISS life support systems runs windows in any case.

By ""this"" I mean as the image shows, with fully loaded weapons while acting aggressive to police officers in their presence. And its true. I can pull up story after story where police officers have shot a black man to death with the excuse that he ""might have had a gun"" and the officer ""feared for his life"" for example, Sean Reed who was shot 13 times on Facebook live for simply running from the police (with the police later saying in an interview that he had a gun and was shooting back, contrary to what the live stream showed)  or Stephon Clark who was shot 20 times for holding a cellphone at night. While on the other hand I can show you scores of stories where active shooters with assault weapons firing into crowds of innocents are still taken into custody without the shooter being shot to death in retaliation, merely for being white

 Alternatively, I can show you the myriad statistics that show that black people are 2.5 times more likely to be shot by officers than white people even when unarmed. 

The fact of the matter is, black people don't get to experience the privilege of the second amendment. They don't get to walk around like ""this"" where they're carrying weapons openly, flagrantly violating quarantine laws and being openly aggressive and hostile to police officers while armed.

Deuteronomy 4:2
"" Do not add a thing to what I command you nor subtract from it, so that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God that I am delivering to you. ""

1 Peter 1:25
 but the word of the Lord endures forever.”And this is the word that was preached to you. 

By the bible's own text, it is not open to updating or editing or interpretations or changing. The scripture is clear on that regard. That means the bible is the voice of god himself, with his full blessing and EVERYTHING in it, is condoned by him. 

That means everything from advocating slavery:

Ephesians 6:5
Slaves, obey your human masters with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ

1 Timothy 6:1–6:1
Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be blasphemed. 

Exodus 21:2–21:6
2When you buy a male Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years, but in the seventh he shall go out a free person, without debt. 3If he comes in single, he shall go out single; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him. 4If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master’s and he shall go out alone. 5But if the slave declares, “I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out a free person,” 6then his master shall bring him before God. He shall be brought to the door or the doorpost; and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him for life.

Leviticus 25:39–25:55
39If any who are dependent on you become so impoverished that they sell themselves to you, you shall not make them serve as slaves. 40They shall remain with you as hired or bound laborers. They shall serve with you until the year of the jubilee. 41Then they and their children with them shall be free from your authority; they shall go back to their own family and return to their ancestral property. 42For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves are sold. 43You shall not rule over them with harshness, but shall fear your God. 44As for the male and female slaves whom you may have, it is from the nations around you that you may acquire male and female slaves. 45You may also acquire them from among the aliens residing with you, and from their families that are with you, who have been born in your land; and they may be your property. 46You may keep them as a possession for your children after you, for them to inherit as property. These you may treat as slaves, but as for your fellow Israelites, no one shall rule over the other with harshness. 47If resident aliens among you prosper, and if any of your kin fall into difficulty with one of them and sell themselves to an alien, or to a branch of the alien’s family, 48after they have sold themselves they shall have the right of redemption; one of their brothers may redeem them, 49or their uncle or their uncle’s son may redeem them, or anyone of their family who is of their own flesh may redeem them; or if they prosper they may redeem themselves. 50They shall compute with the purchaser the total from the year when they sold themselves to the alien until the jubilee year; the price of the sale shall be applied to the number of years: the time they were with the owner shall be rated as the time of a hired laborer. 51If many years remain, they shall pay for their redemption in proportion to the purchase price; 52and if few years remain until the jubilee year, they shall compute thus: according to the years involved they shall make payment for their redemption. 53As a laborer hired by the year they shall be under the alien’s authority, who shall not, however, rule with harshness over them in your sight. 54And if they have not been redeemed in any of these ways, they and their children with them shall go free in the jubilee year. 55For to me the people of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.

Titus 2:9
Slaves are to be submissive to their own masters in everything; they are to be well-pleasing, not argumentative, 

It also means advocating homophobia 

Leviticus 18:22
You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. 

Leviticus 20:13
If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. 

1 Corinthians 6:9-11
 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.

Jude 1:7
Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire. 


And lets not forget good ole misogyny and sexism

Genesis 3:16
To the woman he said,
“I will make your pains in childbearing very severe;
    with painful labor you will give birth to children.
Your desire will be for your husband,
    **and he will rule over you.”**

Ephesians 5:22-24
Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands. 

1 Peter 3:1-7
Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives, when they see your respectful and pure conduct. Do not let your adorning be external—the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear— but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their own husbands,

1 Timothy 2:11-12
Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. 

1 Corinthians 14:34-35
The women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.

I could go on and on about the bible advocating the raping of women and children, the murdering of innocents, the plundering and burning of cities. And remember. By the bible's own scriptures, these are the direct word of god
