AskDocs,fctllrk,t1_fbdh1lk,1577947856.0,"What has helped me is learning to assign (or appreciate) the value in things I otherwise would have dismissed as being a waste of time because they aren’t objectively “productive.” For example, learning to stop and play a board game with my kids instead of picking up the house. If I don’t pause and tell myself that spending time with my kids has value, I end up skipping it to pick up the house. Same with taking time from work for vacations, or a golf game on a Friday afternoon with friends. Therapy is slowly (very) convincing me that taking time to foster relationships with family and friends, or simply do things because I want to, is really important. It’s freeing and ultimately what makes us human as opposed to machines. But I also tried it the other way first, and I don’t recommend it for your long term mental health. It catches up at some point, and its been a hard road back for me."

This is something I continue to deal with in my professional life, and I waited to talk to someone thinking it would sort itself out. Therapy helps, and you might be surprised and get accommodations through your thesis program."

Anxiety,f3f79w1,t3_dgedyv,1570891038.0,"Started therapy about 10 weeks ago, and struggling with this same thing; albeit in context of a job / career, and learning to not feel guilty or anxious about choosing to do something else during working hours. Even taking a lunch is a struggle sometimes, forget about vacation days. Therapy is helping me identify value in these other activities, which helps curb the negative emotions but it’s a struggle. Stay the course; I can’t promise it gets better but I’m told it does, and I’m starting to believe it."
