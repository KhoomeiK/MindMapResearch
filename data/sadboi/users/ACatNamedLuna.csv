It was way cheaper to complete the program as an in-state student but it flew by and was so nice to just get it over with.

I couldn’t place ANY feels related to be ED... mostly because I felt like my ED replaced most of my feelings. I was completely distanced from it. All I felt was pure determination. Most of my instances were like your scenario two, so I would have this planned moment where I could finally eat after not eating for so long and I needed exactly the foods I wanted and needed to be alone for a certain amount of time and if it didn’t all go to plan (friends came over unannounced, the food I was planning to get wasn’t available) I would get SO anxious. I never could connect with stress, anger, loneliness, etc. because I was so focused they didn’t register with me. Mostly I just felt pure determination and almost desperation to follow through with the perfectly thought out plan I had somehow gotten into my head. That just describes my experience."

I don’t regret taking out the loans and don’t know if I could’ve passed if I had tried working nights on top of it. 

The only thing I wished I had done was had a better understanding of new grad pay in my area. In AZ, average RN pay is mid 60s-70s, but some new grad programs start as low as $27.50/hr. I knew it would start low but with the high cost of living, I had to seriously adjust my expectations for what I’d be making as a new grad nurse. Look at the hospitals around you and look at the absolute bottom of the range they have on glass door. You will probably make the lowest amount.

If vegan items sell well and make them money, they’ll sell more. They’ll widen their product line and the percentage of the menu that is vegan will slowly go up. More restaurants will see success and do the same. Menus aren’t endless, so even just replacing ONE meat item for a vegan item makes me happy for now. They will also use $$ to market the vegan items instead of meat items. Finally, the general population will see how accessible vegan items are, how yummy they can be, and how they don’t have to give up their favorite foods to eat vegan.

Approach conversations as you would normally. In my experience, once you get a conversation going almost all patients will open up and be really honest with you. I was a little nervous at first because my classmates were freaking out but the rotation was great and almost all patients were incredibly friendly.

EDAnonymous,esujuv8,t1_esufwto,1562284595.0,"This makes sense! I feel your frustration and that frustration is what lead to my eating disorder. With help from my ED therapist and a dietician, I learned about the science behind weight loss and low restriction is best for weight loss. It sucks because it takes awhile, but it is healthiest for your mind and body and works the best. Also, muscle is heavy so you might gain weight but muscle burns more calories and will help anyone’s fitness journey. Plus, you’ll feel great! 

I stopped weighing myself and worked closely with a doctor. By eating 3 normal, healthy meals a day (and snacks when I was hungry!) and working out 4ish times a week, I lost weight in a healthy way and was strong too! I advise anyone with a disordered eating path to do this with a therapist to limit a slippery slope in to an ED."
EDAnonymous,esujc8t,t3_c98wsn,1562284371.0,"Yes. From my understanding, severe *long-term* calorie restriction slows your BMR because your body will try to conserve energy by limiting the calories it burns. Your body burns carbs/glucose for energy, and then fat and muscle stores, to fuel body processes. When your body runs out of stores and you aren’t putting in new sources of energy, it slows the metabolism and stores anything it can at any chance it gets. This isn’t something that happens quickly, but if your body goes a long time without the adequate caloric intake it needs to sustain life, it’ll eventually start trying to store the calories it might otherwise burn if the person is eating adequate calories. 

I believe it IS a myth in society that this happens easily or causes people to gain weight. In order for this process to happen, your body will be going through this for quite a long time. It doesn’t store the energy to put weight on a person, but to  have a store of energy sources to maintain normal life. 

Summary- long term, severe restriction can do this. Anorexia can lead to this. It doesn’t happen from occasional restriction, and it typically isn’t going to make someone fat."

It sounds like it is affecting you both emotionally and physically and that can be really hard for a person to go through. Additionally, repeated vomiting can be very dangerous. 

I personally loved my relationship with the eating disorder therapist and think she helped me understand why I was doing what I was doing and gave me tools to help stop the behaviors. She changed my thinking. If you are able, I’d recommend googling eating disorder treatments/therapists in your area and request a consult. They will probably do an “interview” where they ask you about your habits and learn more about you. This can give you answers and give them an idea for treatment, if they think it’s necessary. You can also get to know them and see if it’s something you are comfortable with. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this and am glad you reached out! That’s a great first step."
EatingDisorders,esae5bn,t1_esaavuq,1561757568.0,"I came here to say this as well! All other advice on the thread is great, too. I LOVE weight training and truly connected with my body when I saw how strong I got and what my body was capable of, especially after how weak I got during the ED. However, I had to stop weighing myself. I did gain weight with weight training and it was hard to deal with it mentally. When I stopped weighing myself, I could go off how I *felt* and I was much happier. This was a personal decision and just my experience."
EatingDisorders,es8iiu7,t3_c6eea5,1561699172.0,"Denial is a huge part of an ED. I’m proud of you for seeking help and showing up. Recovery means something different for everyone and can be many different paths, but I genuinely believe working with a therapist changed my life. After one year of hard work, the cognitive behavioral therapy truly changed my thoughts. From then on, when I thought “I don’t really have a problem compared to other people, I’m just reacting” I had the tools to redirect my thoughts and tell myself, “no, you do, and you deserve better than this”. I still use these tools every day. It took a long time to accept the ED, but eventually it clicked."

phoenix,eruepkv,t1_eruebzl,1561275596.0,That’s pretty close to me- I’ll be sure to check it out. Thanks!
phoenix,erudzxe,t1_erudrvx,1561274487.0,"I moved 3 years ago and I feel you! I’ve tried all of those as well and was very underwhelmed. I personally like sushiholic enough that I go there quite frequently but I know your frustration of moving here and not finding anything even close to sushi spots in other cities. If you ever do find a great spot, please let me know!"
phoenix,erudhv7,t1_erudcvm,1561273745.0,"I have had plenty of sushi from plenty of different cities... but they didn’t ask for sushi recommendations from around the country, did they? I didn’t say sushiholic was my favorite by any means. I think the valley is lacking is good sushi in general. If you have a spot, how about you recommend it?"
IndianaUniversity,erjcv9i,t3_c29frc,1560923876.0,"So I know everyone says this and it’s easier said than done... but at IU, in my experience, it is what you make of it. With the dorm mess, a bunch of freshman should be living around you. Ask people to hang out! Have people over. JOIN. CLUBS. I made a few really close friends on my floor, but I made the majority of my friends through IUDM and CHAARG. Find a group that is interested in similar things as you are/seems like it’s filled with people you’d get along with and go with it."
phoenix,ergbsld,t3_c1qjst,1560832971.0,"Sushiholic @ Camelback and 40th St for amazing reverse happy hour deals, great sushi, and friendly staff. Sit at the bar for the experience and quick service. 

China Chili @ Osborn and 3rd Street for consistently hot and fresh takeout with a short 10 min wait for food when calling in orders 

Spinato’s @ many locations but we frequent the one at Missouri and 7th St. It’s definitely not gonna be the best pizza in PHX, I admit, but I’m obsessed with the salsicca di pollo pizza, their boneless sweet chili wings are my guilty pleasure, and their delivery drivers are the nicest."
IndianaUniversity,erb99bb,t3_c14514,1560667391.0,"Pods are the best! You still need shower shoes and a caddy to bring your things with you, but they were spread out so there were bathrooms close to all the rooms. They’re super private and my floor had at least 8 of them. However, they didn’t clean ours over the weekend and they got absolutely disgusting. That’s the only con though."
IndianaUniversity,eqlf63r,t3_bynq8u,1560143253.0,"I am a huge fan of taking a lot of major courses at the beginning of your college career so you can have some more leeway junior and senior year. I ended up taking painting and yoga senior year and loved it. This is a good schedule! I always had way more trouble getting to evening classes than waking up for morning classes, so it just depends on your preference.

If you are interested in working out, pack a bag and take advantage of the SRSC or the WIC. I got super fit somewhere around sophomore/junior year only because I wanted to avoid doing homework midday and hit the gym instead. The WIC was kind of run down when I was there but it is way more central to campus and was usually dead, so it’s worth it."
AskReddit,eq0hjwi,t1_epzmfv2,1559684825.0,"THIS ^ It definitely doesn’t need to be a joke at all! My boyfriend and I were stressed and arguing about moving- trying to mesh our ideas of a perfect apartment and neighborhood- when I got overwhelmed, sat down, looked at him, and said, “I don’t know what I want to do.” Instead of saying “well figure it out”, launching in to his own demands, or storming away, he sat down with me and said “we’ll make the right decision”. 

Did our discussion get anywhere? Nah. Did we solve our dilemma? Not at all. But we were becoming heating so I extended a cue to remind him that this is just me, to which he further deescalated the situation by agreeing that we are on the same team."
AskReddit,eonyevx,t1_eoniors,1558724669.0,You know yourself. You sound like you know how to handle the ideations and live with them! My comment was more directed at someone who just began having ideations in the past year or so and is uncomfortable or disturbed by them. They may NOT know how to live with them or stop them from advancing to intent to act.
AskReddit,eony31c,t1_eokvq7m,1558724434.0,"As I said, all people are different. I’m not saying everyone needs medical attention every time. You guys know yourselves! I mean if someone begins having suicidal ideation at any point in their lives, with any diagnosis, that is something to bring up with a medical professional. And I don’t mean going to the hospital, either. I mean seeking a therapist, psychiatrist, mental health nurse, or other medical professional to figure out why you’re having them and to form the tools to stop them from moving any further. But again... EVERYONE is different."
AskReddit,eokvq7m,t1_eokejog,1558662364.0,"This is an amazing explanation. I would like to add that suicidal ideation, while more common, is still extremely dangerous and it still requires quick attention by a medical professional. 

Every person is different and has different needs. What works for some won’t work for others. If you can find an ounce of energy during a day, seek out medical help. These people know what they are doing and will work with you to help fight this. I was extremely depressed and saw no way out UNTIL I met the perfect therapist. She helped me retrain my brain when my thoughts would get dark and out of control. She gave me tools to help myself. She introduced me to a psychiatrist so I could start some meds. She found what worked for me and I am better now than I ever thought possible at my lowest point. 

This isn’t just on you, friend. And you deserve to have help. If you don’t have the energy to find the right professional, call a hotline so they can find one or ask a loved one to do it for you."
