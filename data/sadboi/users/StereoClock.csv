I can't find it though. Can someone give me a link or some of the podcasts?"

bipolar,fkeu3zu,t1_fkeu1kg,1584120715.0,I think people should vote if they want it or not. Le they did in some parts of Australia.
bipolar,fkeu1kg,t1_fkea2g8,1584120673.0,I live in Brazil. We had it for decades. Since the 1930s I think. As far as I know if you only care about energy consumption is like a toss up. Bolsonaro changed it by decree because he wanted to. All the economics questions he answers he says that you should talk with his economy minister. Maybe the minister didn't like DST and he just followed suit.
bipolar,fke2oa8,t3_fhrc7u,1584103559.0,My country sadly dropped Daylights Savings Time. I used to be against it but now I see how good it was for the wellbeing of people. like going to the beach until 7 PM

bipolar,fkb58ce,t1_fjr7p5y,1584026368.0,things are getting better. My classes returned this week. I'm much more busy right now. I'm also taking some gigs to make some extra money to pay my credit card debt thats just ridiculus at the moment

BipolarReddit,fed2hdg,t3_eoexpl,1578995445.0,"Hang in there. It's a recent diagnosis but at least now you know what the problem is and can look for ways to make it better.

I also had many bad decisions in my life. I'd like to think it was only because of bipolar but hobestly it has to be something like 50% BPD and 50% my conscious choice.

Look for a PDOC if you don't have one already. Try to find the right medication with them. It took a while for me to find the right Doctor for me but I've been going to my current one for 10 years right now. We get each other.

Try yo get a book or two about bipolar, they help a lot in the beginning when it's all really New and you don't know your patterns, triggers and what things are The disease and what things are your doing or personality.

Get therapy if you can. It helps a lot if you apply yourself in it.

Take care of your body. Do some exercise, eat well, try to sleep at least 8 hours each night.

And besides all that what worked best for me and took a while to understand was having a structured life. Create a schedule for yourself. With all your duties with others and yourself. If you know what you need to do and where you need to be at any time of the day, when your mood isn't good, it's one less problem that you don't have to think about.

I have no words for how long it took me to understand that last part and how much it helps me over the years.

You are NOT ALONE. TBH I have thought about ending it all but then I remember my family and my 9 years old sister. I could never do that to her. She is the light in my life. If you need to talk you can message me. Or talk in this subreddit with us."
BipolarReddit,fduj5zz,t3_emod1t,1578733878.0,Congratulacions. I know just how hard it is tô do something like that. But it's also really rewarding.
BipolarReddit,fdk0jy3,t1_fdjq1pw,1578493035.0,This. Writting things down help me so much. If it's with pen and paper it's even better. A phone/computer will have other functions that can distract you from what you need to remember.
BipolarReddit,fdk0er5,t3_elqn61,1578492925.0,"Do you have any sleep medication you can take? I know going to bed when you are full of energy is just boring, but it will be good for you. It will help stabilize your mood, and then make it easier for you to focus on what you need to do during the day. I know it's easier said than done. I don't really like taking sleeping pills but boy do they work.

 I'm currently hypomanic too and will see my pdoc later today. Hang in there, it gets better."
bipolar,fczh04d,t3_ejanf7,1578101054.0,"January 6th is my birthday. I will become a 29 years old dude. I was comming back from a trip I did to another City for the New years eve. And decides, still on the bus, that I had to have a birthday party this sunday, the 5th.

But today I was talking with my boas about when I would get my salary for this month. My country law orders that it has to be until the 5th working day of the month. And she told me that she paid my January salary on december 16th.

Woah.

I went back to our whatsapp conversation history and our e-mail exchanges and didn't find anything about this. She indeed paid me the value I earn each month. But I didn't realize it was the money I would normaly get on the next month. I thought it was some extra money for some extra work I had on december since a coworker went on vacations and I also had to do her job until she comes back.

I got really angry at my boss. I don't want no early money. I'm not good with money, even more when I'm as hypomanic as I am right now. I want to quit so bad. She knows her craft but it is a really small business and she isn't a good manager. She's a labour and social security lawyer that gives classes and does some audits. She's also my aunt. And calle my mom when she has some problemas with my work...

So long story short I'll get no work money on this month. Yay. I spent most of it during the trip. Thinking that it was extra. and that I would get my salary on the start of the month as it was not clear what was happening. ugh

So some hours ago I decided to cancel the party. My plan was to do something that isn't expensive, but planning a party is another chore that I don't need in my life right now. I'll probably go to the same place that I go every saturday with my friends. It'll be better, easier and more fun  :)"
