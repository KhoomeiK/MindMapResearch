JUSTNOMIL,fnzldif,t3_g2s9ye,1587396282.0,"OP, I don’t think your the asshole for what you said.

(Disclaimer: everything I’m about to say I do mean that it goes both ways, and in specifically taking about marriage, not dating relationships)

(As a happily married man) I think a husband should prioritize his wife over other relationships including parents/family and if he has to choose who’s side to be on: especially in clear view of other people, it needs to always be his wife’s.  
I think a husband ought to quickly rebuke his mother and defend his wife anytime she speaks ill of her to him or to others in front of him.  This is something that only the husband can do: and if his mother cannot respect his wife, he needs to have a serious conversation with his mother about his expectations and he ought to follow up with any consequences the same way he would if anyone else in his life made a habit of treating his wife poorly. 

I will close my comment by saying two straightforward and possibly harsh sounding things: 

Husbands, if you let your mother treat your wife like shit, or get away with doing things that hurt her or make her feel disrespected: you’re not being a good husband, and you’re not taking your marriage seriously: and it’s actually your fault for not setting a standard with your family. Feel free to PM me if you need advice on how to do this.

Married people, if you do not make each other #1, and if you do not show a united front in the face of the world, and if you do not make it obvious that you are a *TEAM* and no one can come between the two of you, your marriage will most likely fail and you have no one to blame but yourselves. 


Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
AskMen,fnzhkpv,t3_g4ossj,1587394215.0,"I (22m at the time) met a girl (19 at the time)  through mutual friends. She was *very* good looking.  It was kind of a match-make from our friends.  We started hanging out and everything seemed really great at first.  We hung out, texted, talked on the phone quite a bit.  I was really into her.  After a few weeks I met the family, they all really liked me too.  

The first time we ever had a casual conversation about sex, she explained to me a horrible situation in which a music teacher of hers (when she was 16-17) had tried to groom her, would tell her he thought about her every time he had sex with his wife: dude had kids and everything. It was some fucked up stuff.  I tried to veer the conversation away from sex altogether and had decided in my mind I wouldn’t go there for a long time. She would veer the conversation back to sex and tell me she was so intrigued by it and wanted to express it in a way that she could be in control of herself, rather than someone else trying to control her (I thought, great! Liberation for her, taking ownership and control of her sexuality after a fucked up situation in her past affected her! Good for her!)  so I respected that and would continue to talk about sex with her and she liked it.  Our jokingly competitive nature with each other would come out from time to time and she’d tell me all the things she’d like to do to me and I would tell her “you’re all talk! ;) “ and would tell her the things I’d do to her.  We danced this dance for a few weeks and even though nothing ever happened during our actual hangouts: one day she was determined that she would act upon the sexual tension (though I didn’t know it.) 

So we did hang out that night, she looked stunning, wore a long dress.  When we got there, we went walking and she started telling me she wanted me to kiss her.  I told her I didn’t know if I was ready for all of that.  She took it as a challenge and kept insisting all night, at one point even asking a guy walking by if I should kiss her: and of course he agreed with her that I should.  We got to this one bench and sat and she even grabbed my nipple and played with it (yup right in public: and I had told her previously that nipple play turned me on hence why she was doing it: trying to get me to kiss her.)  I just didn’t feel the time was right and I felt she was trying to force/push herself to be sexual and I wanted her to truly want it not tru to convince herself she did.  

After walking the boardwalk we get back to my car: and we got in.  She immediately jumps on top of me and starts making out with me.  Then we decide to go to her car (big SUV) because there was more room.  At this point I realized she was definitely *NOT* trying to convince herself that she wanted it.  We had some fun, rubbed each other off and then left.  Later she told me on the phone that she felt so happy that she could do this with me and it was good, safe and she never felt that she wasn’t completely in control of herself or the situation. 

I am more of a relationship guy so after months of “talking” and our first sexual encounter I felt this was leading to a relationship.  She wasn’t sure if she wanted a relationship: yet we talked on the phone for hours every night.  After all of this went down I knew it was either going to be a relationship or nothing for me so I told her that I needed to know where this was leading.  She told me that she just really didn’t think we were right for each other relationship-wise.  I told her that I understand, but that I didn’t want to do anything sexual with her or hang out alone together constantly because it would be torture for me.  She said she understood.  After that night I’d started slowly distancing myself from her, not answering her nightly calls (at least not every time) and she really didn’t like it.  I explained to her that I couldn’t handle having nightly phone calls with her and continuing to have a pre-dating type of relationship.  She said she understood and didn’t push me.  

Weeks go by and we are now only texting for a few minutes once or twice a week. She seemed to regret her decision to not date me, but never outright said it. 

Months later: I’m now talking to a new girl (who is now my wife btw) and she sees it on social media.  She starts texting me a bit more regularly now, but I didn’t always reply.  Even her mom texted me saying how I should come over to the house because the family misses me.  Eventually this new girl and I start dating.  That’s when I start getting random texts from her (creepy girl) like “hows your fling going? Oh...sorry I meant girlfriend.” After that I started to ignore her texts altogether. 

A year goes by and my girlfriend has noted to me many times throughout this past year that creepy girl would go like her photos and then unlike them.  We just ignored it. 

My girlfriend and I got engaged and one day she’s at the mall when a random girl comes up to her and asks her if she was my fiancé and she says “yes I am.” Then the girl turns around and walks away: but then turns back around and walks back and says, “sorry, I’m his friend *insert her name here*” and then turns around and again walks away.  

My fiancé said “fuck this, block her on everything because that’s crazy AF.”  And i did block her on everything."
