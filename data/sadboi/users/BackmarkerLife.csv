For 2, you would open up Terminal - the following is the pattern:

You would enter:

`ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/obs-plugins /usr/lib/obs-plugins`

Why would you do the latter? If each upgrade continues to put the files into the ""linux-gnu"" directory, you'd have to move the file each time.  The symbolic link allows it it just to auto point to the freshly installed updates.

I bought the Podium Hub to bridge products I've already bought (CC Wheel / button plate\*) while waiting for Simucube availability - esp since COVID-19 took hold.  it's probably July probably the earliest.

The Podium hub was a shortcut to using a new button plate and learning what there was needed in moving to a multi-component, but coherent simrig minus a fully cohesive platform.

This is the reason for me: For months I've had issues with my CSL Elite suddenly going into Xbox or PS4 mode while in iRacing.  Or suddenly dropping FF altogether. It never cost me a win or anything (I have not won or thankfully taken anyone else out because of it), but being 10 hours into a 12 hour race and it happens - not once, not twice, but 5, 6, 7 times (not all 12 hr races) you get the idea.

12 months ago I was hoping to dive into GT Sport and iRacing after already being involved in Forza.  I wanted variety at the time. It's been straight iRacing and leaning toward other PC games.

I have nothing against Fanatec or any of its products - I have V3Is and love them and have used several great wheels. I just don't think a fully Fanatec rig is my future.
