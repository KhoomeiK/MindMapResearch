RedPillWomen,fqw3bc5,t3_gl5qmz,1589691665.0,"I really love wearing scrubs! Get you some that fit nicely, they make a lot of ugly body scrubs but I really like Figs and Grey‚Äôs Anatomy scrubs. They make this really cute top that sort of cinches in at the waist. Cute scrubs are not hard to find online, it‚Äôs only in stores that they have the ugly ones. I think I look really cute in scrubs, and so does my boyfriend. Also, get a nice fuzzy jacket/sweater! The North Face (or Columbia?) Oso jacket looks great with scrubs. Scrubs can look really nice, you just have to find the ones that compliment your body best. I always wear my hair up in either a low or high bun. I try to make it look ‚Äúdone‚Äù by teasing the crown and making the front volumized. If you want to bring in your vintage flair, I think a nice headband could do the trick. I think the secret to taking your look up a notch is to accessorize. I always, always wear some sort of earring. Nothing too showy, usually just small gold hoops or silver hearts. I try not to wear anything larger than a quarter while at work or else it tends to look gaudy. My safety googles are pink and bedazzled. I know that‚Äôs kind of extra but I think it‚Äôs really fun! If you want to be tame about it, they make goggles that are just pink at the rims. We can‚Äôt wear nail polish, so I just keep my nails clean and short. I also wear a ring to match my jewelry, but it‚Äôs usually on a necklace because we wear gloves. I have a nice lanyard for my badge that is silver, not lanyard styled cloth. They make plenty of ‚Äújewelry‚Äù lanyards and I also put pins on my id badge that I like. My number one tip is to wear lip gloss and some fake lashes. I have a pretty tame everyday makeup look but my lashes are the one thing I won‚Äôt skip out on, they really make me look and feel awake and confident. If you need some recommendations on certain brands of scrubs let me know!"

Nobody cares about Piper from OITNB, we care more about the other more interesting characters she meets in prison. Same for Eric from That 70‚Äôs Show, we were all invested in the crazy dynamic between Jackie and Hyde more than Donna and Eric.

RedPillWomen,fpd00uv,t3_gcpz5i,1588516871.0,"Lifting will make your body change but it won‚Äôt make you not fat. I would try just lifting for a couple of weeks, and if you still feel like you‚Äôre not leaning out then add in cardio. Even 15 min of cardio before and after a session can make a difference! Since you‚Äôre working out for aesthetics and not strength yet, try to work in higher rep ranges and consider circuit workouts. They‚Äôre very beginner friendly. Strength and endurance takes time to develop, it‚Äôs okay if you are only lifting lightly. Just keep pushing yourself and you‚Äôll get to a good baseline soon. I know gym equipment is scarce but when I first started working out as a teenager I used to lift textbooks, gallons of water, sandbags, and got a decent pump. If you keep eating in a surplus, lifting & calories will likely burn enough calories to make you lose some weight but it won‚Äôt be optimal. At least try to clean up your diet little by little until you‚Äôre eating mostly nutrient dense foods."
