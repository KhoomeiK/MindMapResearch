You also cannot gain access to guardian modules without horizons, so fighting thargoids with railguns {Gauss} IS a gameplay change...and you can only do that with horizons. Also if you want a fighter with a rail gun {gauss} you need horizons.

You can also DRIVE on land, which is a MASSIVE gameplay change, considering that you can only fly in space. You also have gravity on planets, which is another gameplay change if you fly FA-Off.

Horizons drastically changes the game in all aspects."

But...if I'm at range and pounding the rails, the extra distance comes in handy when they initiate the chase.

AFAIK people who use ewfficient PA's need to get pretty close to hit bc of terrible shot speed. Damage falloff doesn't even matter because you wont hit anything at 2km away with those things. But if I always maintain distance and shoot when I know they are getting in position to shoot me, and then I toggle FA on and then change direction, it throws off their aim and timing window. they only have like 2 seconds to line up the shot, and 90% is prediction. if i know they're predicting one thing, and then i disrupt them, it gives me a second to change my plan so that they don't have time to correct their aim.

When other people see people like you and me thriving despite the horrors that we had to live through, they almost don't know how to react.

I don't think that anything can be worse than what you experienced, and because of this, nothing you ever experience will ever be as bad as that. I want to believe that anything else you have to go through will pale in comparison to what you have lived through.

Long story short....I had to leave the love of my life in order for her to get the help she needed. It was hard, but I know it needed to be done if she was ever going to live a happy life.

She resented me for it. It's been almost 7 years I think and she has made it clear that she hasn't forgiven me for leaving her. But I know she is better now.

I knew a girl who cared about animals and was also a perfectionist. She started fostering sick kittens and nursed them back to health. I think it made her happy.

mentalhealth,ff2izpz,t1_fexck8j,1579508272.0,"Some of those things can be caused by really simple things like the food you eat and even your posture.

Your brain is a machine right? So, machines need certain types of fuel and maintenance to operate correctly. Cars need coolant, oil, and gas, and if you neglect any of those things, the car isn't going to be very happy. You also gotta make sure that the pipes aren't leaking or kinked, so that the fuel gets to where it needs to go.

I remember I stopped eating fruit and veggies and only ate breakfast stuff like eggs and potatoes and toast. I wasn't drinking a lot of water and OMG concentrating was really hard. I was streaming on twitch back then, so my posture was VERY bad, I basically devolved into a rage streamer because my brain was not getting the proper nutrients, and the bad posture was inhibiting proper blood flow and neural function. Everything frustrated me, I couldn't think straight, I just started getting angry and depressed at everything.

Are you on a routine at all?

Also, what are your hobbies and stuff? I'm also a perfectionist; I started applying my unrealistic standards into attempting things that I know I could not possibly do, so that way I was guaranteed to fail and eventually I got used to failure and learned to laugh at it.

I was multivariate calculus before I finished High school and I was a theoretical physics major. Dropped that and ended up working as a nuclear power plant worker (go homer simpson!)

It wasn't until MUCH later that I learned that the basics of music theory are based on harmonic frequencies. Electronics were the base of my work at the time, so once I realized that common guitar chords were based on scientific theory, music started making more sense.  


I noticed that the majority of music instructors would say ""This isn't important, but the harmonic frequencies are why certain notes sound good and why others sound bad. It's science stuff and all you need to know are the relationships between blah blah blah""  


So, at it's most basic form...music theory is literally based on ratios and patterns.

mentalhealth,ff2gacl,t1_fey39y9,1579504874.0,"I'm open about it.

I tried breaking up with her multiple times. She always managed to pull be back. She was VERY attractive, incredibly sexy, knew how to turn me on, and she always used her sexual prowess to her advantage to get her way with me. If I didn't do what she wanted, sometimes she would flirt with other men to make me jealous. I was weak.

She was very skilled at using crocodile tears. She told me that if I ever left her that she would commit suicide. I felt trapped.

I basically had a mental breakdown and disappeared for 3 days. Friend and family thought I was dead, missing person report was filed. Didn't end up very well.

I told her that I can't be with her anymore. She managed to get me back....AGAIN.

The only choice I had at this point was to break any attraction she had to me.

I stopped lifting, I started binging video games, I started acting like Dennis from It's Always Sunny. She had a VERY high IQ and I was a nuclear engineer, so the intelligence and refinement was something she liked about me. I started smoking weed also.

She said if I didn't change she would leave, I said ""ok bye.""

She left, then asked me to get back with her again. I felt bad for her because I knew she had no friends so I said we'd talk. I found out that she basically didn't have money for food and I caved and started taking care of her again.

Next move was very tactful: I ate a ridiculous amount of sativa based marijuana candies and went on a drug induced rant about how her entire family sucks and how much i dislike her. I could tell that she wasn't convinced...so I took it a step further and texted her mom and dad, blaming them for everything bad that has ever happened to this girl.

She was really into human rights and stuff so I started posting homophobic memes on my FB page.

I basically had to act like the opposite of what she considered good.

I was a theoretical physics major at the time.

I thought it was all in my head but revelation states that the bible will be cryptic until a future time where education and science has expanded. That's when I saw that the Bible was the irrefutable truth of our world.

Everything about life suddenly made sense after that. Everyone says that the bible is outdated, but the bible says ""People in the future are gonna say that this is outdated. They're wack. Stay away from them"" and woohoo it came true.

It also says that the final world war will be between God and satan. We are living in a time where blasphemy is seen as comedic and edgy. Also, all nations are nuclear capable. We will never have another world war. Hiroshima was the end of world wars, no nation is going to risk a nuclear holocaust.

But yes. The Bible, in it's most basic form, is the original Life Instructional Manual.

Unfortunately...a few assholes managed to secure power in the church and they abused it. Bible says that is an unforgivable sin. Perversion of the word, blasphemy, self condemnation, and I wanna say living in contempt of sin

If you cant think of anything that you are good at and you think that everything you do is something bad, then it means you lack self-confidence and you are over critical of yourself.

The next step would to be why you feel that way about yourself. EVERYONE has a strength.

The way we perceive ourselves is heavily based on the things that we are surrounded by. This is why therapists say that a support network of people who make you happy is important.

Having no self confidence can be rooted to a few things. Is there someone in your life who is constantly criticizing you or making you feel like you're not good enough for them? Also, do you remember the last time someone told you that you were good at something?

It's all building blocks. Therapy sessions only last an hour so it takes a long time to get to the root of it all. I'll try to help so that you have more insight on yourself at your next appt.

Weakness are qualities about yourself that you can never seem to get right


Like...I used to be really ""nice"" and I wanted to make everyone laugh, so my strength was that I had a good heart, but I was also really annoying and sometimes offensive accidentally [comedy for ya] so my weakness was not knowing when to filter my jokes.

I didnt want to accept that 99% of my jokes were unfunny....but once I entertained the idea and stopped saying everything I thought of, people started telling me to ""shut up you're not funny!"" less and less and less.

Eventually I learned what was funny and what wasnt....now I'm actually in the process of writing my first stand up. People generally enjoy my comedy now, and that's because i took the time to really think about what sucks about me.


Not just telling myself I suck, everyone knew that. I needed to understand WHY I sucked so much, and once I did, I stopped doing the sucky thing and now people think I'm funny. I tricked them.
