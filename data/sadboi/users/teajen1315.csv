schizoaffective,fkkecrv,t1_fkjgavt,1584281940.0,"When I’m in the psych ward all they do is double or triple my meds. My psychiatrist and I agreed that once I notice signs I can double my dose. I had the floating feeling and wasn’t sleeping in October. Doubled my dose for a week and it definitely made a difference. Mind you I was a zombie for that week: Shuffled walking, sleeping most of the day...like being in the psych ward. But it definitely slowed it all down and knocked me out every night that I took the double dose at bedtime. Talk to you psychiatrist about having that plan in place.  Not sure if you’re working. I’m on disability. If I wasn’t on disability I would have had to choose between doubling my dose or being able to function at work.

I’m sorry your marriage is ending because of her."
JUSTNOMIL,fazp9g1,t3_eat4a3,1576418320.0,"No you are not. You are in a very sensitive emotional state and should limit interactions with her. I tried to be accommodating to my MIL during my pregnancy and she ruined every moment I tried to include her in. At our first sonogram she started asking the Dr questions about birth defects which ended up freaking me out and had me crying and searching google for days. At the baby shower she made fat jokes. And when she visited me in the hospital after the delivery she refused to acknowledge me and then refused to wash her hands and used hand sanitizer instead. I ended up crying after she left the hospital because I wasn’t sure if the hand sanitizer hurt the baby’s skin and the nurse had to hug me and calm me down. Protect your mental health during your pregnancy and the first 3-6 months after. This is not your MIL’s moment. And if she doesn’t like you, she is going to naturally and inevitably ruin all moments she has with you. And you are too emotionally sensitive to take it all in stride like you were doing previously. BAN her. Let your husband know you just can’t emotionally deal with her. I regret not having the guts to do it."
coparenting,fads2pk,t3_e8np49,1575984640.0,"Is the 50/50 custody court ordered? If so, spend two months documenting everything for him. Then have him take her back to court to address all issues. As for the constant texting, tell him that he should relay to her that he is happy to have the kids call her at a set time everyday and then he needs to ignore all other texts from her. The courts will find her constant texting unreasonable. Keep all text messages of him confirming a pickup time the day before and then her not sticking to it. Tell him he needs to limit most communication to text and email so that he can use it as evidence in court. But also set a boundary as text and email are less emotional than phone calls at time. Relay your plan to him and help him follow through. I want to add that you should try your best to never bad mouth his ex, to harbor any ill will towards her and as your relationship progresses be the bigger person and offer an olive branch if possible. Do that for the kids and who you hope your ex’s new girlfriend would be towards you and your kids."
