God‚Äôs plan of salvation has always been for all people, because not one person is perfect.  God desires that no one perishes, but that we can all have eternal life through Him (John 3:16).

In the Old Testament God reveals his plan to save all nations and bless all nations through Abraham (Genesis 12:3).  Abraham had a relationship with God and walked with God, so God decided to use Abraham and his children to bring about His plan of salvation.  God‚Äôs promises to Abraham were symbolized with circumcision of the flesh (Genesis 17). Abraham‚Äôs son was Isaac, Isaac‚Äôs son was Jacob, whose name was later changed to Israel.  Israel had 12 sons that became the tribes of Israel.  They grew into a nation when they were living in Egypt, eventually becoming slaves to Egypt.  God uses Moses to rescue the Israelites, reminding Moses that He is God (Exodus 3:5-6).  Once God rescues them, He sends them into the desert with Moses as their leader.  This is where He invites them to be his chosen people, in honour of His promise to Abraham (Exodus 19:3-6).  God wanted Israel to show the world that He is God and that He requires holiness and perfections.  God gave His law to the Israelites and used them to administer His justice.  In doing this, he revealed to Israel that they were no better than other nations because they also could not live up to the standard of perfection.  All the wrath and judgement God would bring upon the nations was so that they would finally realize that He is God and that they need Him to save them.

After Jesus came into the world, died, and rose again.  His gift of salvation was given to all who might believe (John 1:7).  Before Jesus ascended into heaven, he told his disciples to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:16-20).  The Holy Spirit revealed to the Apostles all people can have a relationship with God through salvation in Jesus.  This was made known to Peter when he had a vision about God making ‚Äúunclean‚Äù animals ‚Äúclean‚Äù (Acts 10 & 11).  They now understood that circumcision wasn‚Äôt just a fleshly symbolism of God‚Äôs promises, but a spiritual circumcision of the heart shows who are truly God‚Äôs children (Romans 2:25-29).  God‚Äôs promises and blessings were extended to all Gentiles (like you and me) who repent and believe in Jesus, walking in relationship with Him! (Ephesians 2:11-22) (Ephesians 3:1-13)

I know this is a long answer to your question, but I think the context is so important  :D

As we study Romans, we are going to see more about how Gentiles (you and me) receive God‚Äôs blessings and promises.

I hope you find this helpful!"
