Hi! Nurse here! 30% false negative rates aren't common with any test that I'm aware of. In fact, it's not protocol or reality to retest patients who have negative results on other tests, unless there's a damn good reason to think it's a false negative.

Nurse,fnzi0hf,t3_g4m8dz,1587394454.0,"This has always been my question pre-pandemic. It has always upset me when patients roll over to hospice with days left of life, more often than not with EXTREMELY inadequate pain control. I once had a patient come into my inpatient hospice and die an hour later. In my eyes that looked like his insurance was sucked dry until literally the last minute. 

Hospice is for patients to live out their last days comfortably and with as much dignity and pain control as possible. Rarely I see that. I'm not talking about people who didn't want to go hospice until it was over. I've worked in many areas and have definitely had the 94 year old who didn't want to keep going back to the hospital and wanted to be palliative or hospice, but the doctors in the SNF waited until day 30 to write the hospice order, and wouldn't make them a DNR before day 30. That lady coded on day 30, with orders to roll to hospice the next day, and was a full code. It was really shitty to know she wanted to die, to know she'd died so well and peacefully, and having to go through the code and compressions anyway. 

Sorry for the rant and tangent. Hospice is my absolute favorite, my whole heart is in it, and it actually really hurts and stays with me when patients aren't referred in time. If someone is definitely going to die, and hospice is available for their last 6 months of life, why is it not utilized? (Money is my bet)

In this specific post though, covid is so fast, and you can't often predict who will recover overnight or not. And because it's so fast, families are not at all ready to make end of life plans. In fact, I don't think offering hospice to majority of covid patients is appropriate, given the uncertainty of recovery, the inability for loved ones to grasp that their mom was talking this morning and now they're faced with death unexpectedly."
babyloss,fnuubaq,t1_fntkamy,1587271278.0,Yes you can thank you.
LeopardsAteMyFace,fnspp6v,t1_fnskkoi,1587226423.0,"Correct. They understand why close loved ones abort because they're immediately involved in that plight/ situation and understand why it's best for them. But *other* people doing it are using it as birth control, or whatever. They don't have empathy, they cannot understand that other people struggle too.

Even if it's medically necessary they will hate that person. I had to terminate for medical reasons once. I wanted that baby like you wouldn't know, even if my life situation was not ideal. But the medications I was on were category x, baby *would definitely, without a doubt* have fatal issues because of it. I was ~7 weeks when I did it and had already gained 30 lbs in water weight and had to wear my husband's shoes (size 15!) to walk comfortably. I already had one baby die after birth at this point (15 years today actually), and had suffered the entire hour of her life outside, and I know better than most the life she faced had she survived. Abortion was the fucking kindest thing I could do for that baby, while they were still cells. I sobbed the whole time, even after they sedated me. I came to when putting my pants back on with the nurse and my husband, still just crying that gut wrenching wail a mother makes when their child dies. I knew it had to happen. I knew it was the right choice. I wish I never had to do that but the damage from the meds before I knew I was pregnant had been done. 

I've told this story to people before when talking about abortion rights. Mostly people are understanding and sympathetic. But there are always the cocks that say ""you didn't give that baby a chance! Miracles happen and they could've been fine but you killed them!"" I'm a very educated nurse. I work with those patients. I know the life they'd have suffered through if they lived at all. Category X meds aren't ""maybe there will be birth defects"". Category X meds are ""maybe it will be a non fatal defect but you won't have any quality of life"". It was a psych med I was on to combat my severe severe PTSD problems I was drowning in. I had to pick between my long term mental health treatment and recovery, or a very sick and eventually dead child for the second time in my life (not to mention the physical and mental toll my high risk pregnancies take)

I want to take this moment to add that there's an acne medication that is Category X called Accutane. When my sister took it years ago as a teen, she had to take monthly online quizzes about the side effects and dangers of it. She had to have monthly blood work done to check her kidney function and pregnancy status. She had to be on birth control because the damage to a fetus from the drug was horrendous. I swear to you that, at least at the time, it was required by *the government* that if she got pregnant while on Accutane, she had to have an abortion. I mean, they can't force you to have one, but the general gist(jist?) of it was ""this is incredibly damaging and almost always fatal to the fetus, and we will not be held liable if you choose to continue your pregnancy"". 

My point is, you can't make general assumptions that other people's abortions are not necessary. Or that we don't care about killing our babies. Or that it's birth control for us. Or whatever the fuck. 

I called around before my abortion to see if any lab wanted the embryo/fetal tissue. Because I'm a nurse, I understand the need for things like that to research, especially in my case with the Category X meds. I didn't want money, I wanted to provide something that could maybe be beneficial to science, and maybe give my little one's ""life"" meaning. And honestly, there was nobody who could help me find a way to donate it. Even the people who I talked to at PP sounded like I was weird for asking. It just seemed so wrong to me to discard tissue that could maybe be helpful, y'know? 

Yet constantly these pro-birthers claim we're getting money to abort and have the tissue/fetus fucked with somehow. It isn't true. I tried. 

Anyway idk why I went off on this tangent. I'm having a tough day as it is and this subject always pisses me off. These pro-birthers are a scourge to the world and are completely blind, unsympathetic, unrealistic and gullible af to their movement."

They gave no fucks about their employees, paid them dollars less an hour than the hotels immediately surrounding them because ""we don't have a casino so *shrug*"" and even though the employees voted in a union in..2018?.. they (Trumps/ whoever) had been refusing to acknowledge it for months and last I remember they (Trump fam) were going to court over it.

Because I promise you, there will be. China makes most of our drugs and they haven't been working for months. 

Usually Versed is given to do the actual intubation. It's a very short acting drug, so it's illogical to have patients on that, even if it's a drip, because there are better benzos that last longer. They're probably on IV Ativan, or PO Xanax via feeding tube. 

These drugs also depresses the respiratory system. Even on a vent, they could start retaining co2 because of liquid filled lungs and a decrease in the drive to breathe, and they can't effectively exchange gasses. Heavy sedation is probably very unsafe in these patients. 

So, to reiterate, other benzos work better/longer once intubation has been done."

Shame on her."
Coronavirus,fl4uy7g,t1_fl4awiz,1584822077.0,Yeah but ARDS isn't something that RT or nurses deal with *this* frequently.
Coronavirus,fl4up7f,t1_fl4cyy5,1584821910.0,???? I'm a nurse and what they said is correct. What are you asking for?
Coronavirus,fl4fbfr,t1_fl4auak,1584812320.0,"I'm not understanding why you think this isn't factual? Or what any of your points are?

Coronavirus,fl40rjc,t1_fl3vj51,1584803226.0,"I've worked with some nurses who are super unconcerned and flippant about it.

I told her only n95 works against covid and she shrugged."

hockey,fkz92ii,t3_fljtah,1584665548.0,At least we didn't lose that many in that amount of time in game 7 last year. Woooow.
