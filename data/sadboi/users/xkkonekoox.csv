learnart,fiuey7e,t3_f9ruy1,1582740111.0,"Hi there! I'd love to give some feedback on the actual drawing itself, what you can do to improve the portion, and then give you some general advice on how to improve art. 😄

- In the realistic art world, there is no such thing as a black outline. The eyelid, the shape of the eye, the pupil highlight, and the limbus, can have an outline as a draft, but later use more values to contrast shadows/highlights together and blend them in together (I will explain more of this in a bit)

 -  The lower eyelid/waterline is not visible, especially on the outer corner of the eye. The tear duct can be more exposed. Also try shading in an eyebag below.

- (assuming this is a female eye) Lashes should be increasing the amount from least to greatest, and could use some more curvature. Try focusing on the perspective. the middle lashes should be more like a straight line, then slowly turning at an angle as the direction is changing left/right. try to bunch a few lashing together and intersecting them. As for the lower lashes, there should be a very minimal amount, slightly longer and light. Maybe two strands crossing against eachother here and there.

- Iris's are much bigger, try increasing the size a bit, The pupil should be black yes, but gradually blend in with the Iris. More amount of detail of shadows and highlights in the Iris would drastically improve the drawing, since it is the main focal point.


I hope these help! I would suggest to try studying more of the tonal scale, dark shadows and bright highlights are crucial. Use a lot of references and even look up how people draw eyes! Even try tracing (as a practice) and see how it goes. I would also suggest to study anatomy and perspective. It's honestly all about practice. Practice drawing everday, even for 30 minutes, whatever free time you have, any doodle helps. If you have questions feel free to ask me. This is a really great drawing, especially for a beginner. Keep up the great work, I hope to see you post more! Art is honestly my life and it's such a big passion of mine. Don't know where I'd be without it 🙂"

So my feelings of wanting to feel be tidy is what motivates me to clean. I usually imagine a whole checklist: clean the countertops, disinfect, dust, vaccum and mope floor, laundry, wipe down pretty much everything mirrors/tables etc. It's just freedom"
