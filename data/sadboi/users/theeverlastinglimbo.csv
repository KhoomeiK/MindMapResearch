Secondly, your mom sounds a whole lot like mine. She's the only person that can push me to the edge and when she does and I react, I now know to never expect a kind word or an apology from her. 
Specifically, why do you think she should apologize? I know it's not a good feeling when someone so close to you shows no compassion, but you have to learn who is unable to be emphatic.you can't ask for them to be sorry for not being able to show this particular emotion, especially because it will burn you inside. I never expect my mother to show love or pity towards my depression, and so far I've spared myself a lot of anger. 
The only think you can do, if you really need a person who feels sorry for you, is to surround yourself with people that you know who are kind, loving and compassionate.  Don't ever let a person who can't show pity get you down. They're the worst kind."

My brother has asthma and he has a high fever. We don't know if he's infected or not because they won't test him until the fever last for three days. I don't think he is infected but in case he was we are self-quarantined. 

Work was suspended this month so I won't get paid anything. I am a freelancer. My mom and stepdad are both independent sellers (I don't know the perfect English term, but basically they go around houses selling cleaning vacuums) and obviously they can't work. So basically nobody is earning anything until everything calms down. Keep in mind we are 6 people in the house so it takes a lot of money even just to eat.

I had asked for a raise just previous to all this and got told that it was okay, but my boss already told me that looking at it now he can't afford any more employees, so right now I'm stuck. 

I'm also separated from my boyfriend because I was staying at my mom's house and he was staying at his mom's house when all this happened and I don't want to risk seeing him and possibly contaminating his father because he had a heart condition.

Also it brought back suicidal thoughts that I fought so long to  bury. I just feel stuck and hopeless and I will have nothing left once this is all over."
