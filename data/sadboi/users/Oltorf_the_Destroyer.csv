We got to my desk and it was a low wall cubicle that faced in - so anyone that walked by would be looking over my shoulder. Also my boss‚Äô office had 3 glass walls and faced everyone else‚Äôs desks. It felt a bit sweat shoppy. And my initial impression was correct. This place monitored exactly how much time you spent at your desk and a lot of other micromanager things. It really didnt make sense because I spent most of my time out in the field seeing work sites. They expected me to drive to the office, check in on the computer, check out a work truck, and then go. Everywhere else I‚Äôve worked just gives you the keys so you can come and go as you please. Also, My boss was weird and a total jerk who made it very clear that he did not like me.
