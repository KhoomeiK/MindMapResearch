Growing with, I was made fun of as a kid in elementary school because I wouldn't blend in with other people. It took me a really long time to replicate people's social behavior and a lot of speech therapy to get where I am today. But my main focus in becoming a doctor, is to diagnose kids right, let parents know what they're kids are like (how they stim, communicate, express themselves, nonverbal behavivor etc...) and also to let both kids and adults know that having a disability is ok, having a disability does not make you bad or worthless or weird, etc, like mainstream social media tells you that having a disability is bad... this is going to be hard to word out on my college essay and I'm not sure if my parents would agree with my opinion because they might think I want a therapy role, or a psychiatrist role. Either way, thank you so much :)))"

I did mention that after highschool or college I wanted to see a therapist and make sure I'm doing ok with my progress. But right now, all of us don't have access to that. As the other comment said, right now all you can do is trust that your therapist will admit you to a hospital where you will get help. Stay safe and if you ever want to talk to us, we're all here."

SuicideWatch,fq2wigh,t1_fpffr6n,1589060587.0,"Yeah, right now I'm not in a good place especially with emotional and mental abuse from both my parents on college. I'm just really worried about college and having to go to a community college because my statistics weren't good enough for the pre-med/biology major I'm taking. It's a really long and hard way to go but I hope I have enough motivation and hope to take my SAT again and I hope it's online this time :) it's just that both my parents are telling me I won't get into college with the statistics I have now. But if I complete senior year with all A pluses and with the 3 credits I'm taking to become a LPT (licensed practical nurse!). It's the thought of being autistic, I think which makes me feel worthless and not smart at all. Even since I was dianogosed at 4 with it, there has been a lot of child abuse especially with my mom, who found out. My dad doesn't really care and he thinks I need to be 'normal' even though I literally have the symptoms/little things that autistic's do. There's some irony in my neurodevelopmental disability case which is my dad actually has it, doesn't know that and has passed it on to me. I just wish my mom was married to another person that would not have this but, I need to realize that this happens for a reason, and there is good in being autistic, not that I am actually stupid in any way, it's just that my social behavior and how I think and respond is different to others. Ok, this was really long and hope you don't mind but yeah.. thanks op"

But thinks it just a label. If I were to get a physical disability which changes my physical self, then a developmental disability will change my mindset, how I talk, communicate, express myself, learn things, etc... My life is just fucked up a lot around academics and autism. I used to view autism, as this uncontrollable disability, which would make me retarded for life. I think the physical and emotional tramua when I was younger really got to me in 7th grade and now I can't stop thinking about the future, and how I should've changed my past.

Thank you so much for doing this AMA. 

1.) How did Corin’s production change over the course of five years? In terms of applications, style and samples. 



2.) Did you make a new setup for the new album or it is the same? Very excited! 



3.) In the Exclaim! Interview you answered recently, Corin did mention having to change his production usage up using different instruments and a guitar in one of the songs. Which song has a guitar in the background? 




4.) How did Megan’s vocals and lyrical composition change over time? Also, were you inspired by your family on certain songs or by your art books to some of the lyrics on the album? 


Once again, I am very excited for the tour even though it is delayed. Super happy about the album and you should be too. The wait is worth it. Thank you so much :)- rk"
