To the thing you said about trauma: my mom died almost four years ago, one year later I had my first panic attack and started with sh shortly after. From there it’s been a downward spiral with mood swings.

The more he said the more nervous I got because I saw myself in his behaviour (not as strong and not with all the symptoms but enough to realize that I might have the same illness). The guy apparently got banned from the biggest psych ward on the region that is basically the last place you can go to and no one wants to treat him anymore.
