Marimo,fpg7js1,t3_gd5go2,1588596415.0,Not 100% sure but I think that‚Äôs a bad idea. I remember reading somewhere that Marimo are best kept in cooler water (main reason they‚Äôre recommended to be kept out of the sun) it‚Äôd probably be best to store then separate while you cycle your water. I try to keep mine in like 60f or lower

relationship_advice,erwyskc,t3_c4jubd,1561362693.0,It seems like you have some problems building trust. A lot of the internet can make it seem like everyone cheats but it really isn‚Äôt as common as it seems. If she‚Äôs a high quality and hard working person she wouldn‚Äôt just cheat on you. If you weren‚Äôt meeting her needs she would tell you. Don‚Äôt worry yourself about it too much man. I seriously doubt she‚Äôs doing anything disloyal.
