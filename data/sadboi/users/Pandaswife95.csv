Psychosis,fr5tzrz,t3_gmo5fr,1589914639.0,"I think it depends. My fiancé remembers a lot of his delusions - however the ones that have been extremely severe and are classified as part of his psychotic break he has little to no memories of. He completely blacked out right before both of his hospitalizations, and that’s when his delusions were at their most severe (threatened to kill me, threatened to kill the president, thought I was replaced by a government issue robot etc). When I worked in a psychiatric hospital for teens, one of my patients had a psychotic disorder and it was the same situation. Sometimes he would remember his delusions in detail, other times he would have no memories of his behaviors or delusions ie: kicking another therapist in the face on my day off and then not understanding why she was bruised and had a broken nose the following week with no memory of the assault. This is just my experience though."
stimuluscheck,fr3dj50,t1_fr3de30,1589855086.0,I just tried it - it didn’t work 😓
stimuluscheck,fr35vz3,t1_fr35r2f,1589850579.0,So I did check with mine (he’s also my parents’) and he said he absolutely did not make that mistake and I qualify - that said when he gave me my taxes to sign and review in February he had accidentally put some of my little sister’s paperwork with my own and I had to rectify it so I don’t totally trust him. My parents said I’m not claimed on the copy they got though.
ABA,fr28v78,t1_fr28oq5,1589833148.0,Fingers crossed! It would definitely make things a lot easier. We don’t have a cancellation policy and I have one client whose mother cancels a lot due to her being sick frequently so it would be great to still do sessions with her son remotely so he’s not missing out.
stimuluscheck,fr288me,t1_fr2680j,1589832839.0,I hope your senator is able to provide guidance! My fiancé is in the middle of his SSID appeal but I know he did the non-filer get my payment and was told he would get the money but we haven’t gotten it.
ABA,fr27wof,t1_fr277zt,1589832675.0,I think it’s great that she’s trying to get the other cases doing at least partial telehealth. I’m lucky enough to have 19 hours a week right now (it was 29 but some of my younger cases couldn’t handle the standard 3 hour sessions anymore) so I’m hoping because I still have 5 clients and telehealth overall seems to be working that they’ll allow for RBTs to continue telehealth. I know my clinical supervisor is hoping that because it’s been so successful for us they will allow telehealth supervisions and telehealth appointments when an RBT is sick/contagious but able to work from home - so maybe that’s something insurance companies will consider too.
stimuluscheck,fr1rjn7,t1_fr1r4xk,1589824728.0,Hopefully they do! I’ve been supporting myself since I finished undergrad (although my parents are the “bank” I have my loans taken out with for grad school - but I’m paying them back) - I checked with our tax accountant to make sure he hasn’t been still filing my parents’ taxes listing me as a dependent and he says he isn’t but I’m worried he made an error somewhere.

stimuluscheck,fr1mbr1,t1_fr1kycr,1589822206.0,"I filed in the beginning of March - and I’ve tried every which way in the book. No capitals, with capitals, with condo number, without condo number just street address. It hasn’t made a difference. We moved in mid March because our landlord died and her realtor son sold it out from under us with zero warning (that’s a whole other story...) and I’ve tried both with our old and new address. Still get the PSNA. Fiancé was able to file as a non-filer (he’s disabled, waiting on SSI hearing) and got notice he’d be getting a check at our new address."
ABA,fr1lptg,t1_fr1kkcg,1589821910.0,"I think at the end of the day you have to do what’s best for you and your son - whatever that may be. I actually have a client at my ABA practice who is in an extremely similar situation and ultimately he took the kids and left and the custody battle is nasty but it’s been better for his and the kids mental health. That said, if I’ve learned anything from my own experience it’s that nothing is permanent. I went from crying everyday and literally sleeping with a knife under my pillow for months just in case I needed it - and now we’re at a point where we’re able to just binge watch Marvel movies and play games together. It’s definitely not a “normal” relationship, but it is pleasant despite all the hardship that comes with it, and I wouldn’t give it up. Also with the therapy - finding a therapist is like trying on shoes! A lot of people don’t seem to realize this and think after a therapist or two if it didn’t click or stick it’s just “not for them”. I’ve found (both working in a psych hospital, at an ABA practice, in grad school to become a clinical psychologist and personal experience) that therapy doesn’t work properly until you find the right therapist. You can force yourself to see someone, the same way you can force your foot into a pair of shoes that isn’t quite right, but you’re not going to be comfortable. Try them on! Call a ton who specialize in family counseling - and you can probably find a niche who does family counseling for autism. If you call the number on the back of your insurance card they’ll give you a list of providers. Conduct phone interviews. They may be the “expert” but that doesn’t make them the right fit. You have to try them on for size and sometimes it can take months to find the right person, but when you do it makes a difference. Based off your OP it sounds like your partner is the one rejecting therapy, if you do decide you want to continue your relationship, have her get involved interviewing candidates. A lot of people feel like they lose control because a therapist is providing advice they may not like or always agree with - by giving her some control over the process of finding the right person it may help."
stimuluscheck,fr1jjso,t1_fr1jc7g,1589820829.0,I’m sorry you’re going through that! My fiancé did the non filer too and he hasn’t gotten his check either and it’s been weeks.

I have one of my client’s mothers ask me daily when I can be in the home....none of my other clients seem to want me there or care about the fact that we’re doing telehealth instead. I’ve asked my BCBA but she has no idea either and our clinical director has only said how much she loves telehealth so I have no idea when we’re expected to go back. I definitely would not be comfortable doing so. I have a lung condition and an autoimmune disease, definitely not something I have any intention of doing any time soon. It seems like it’s a total toss up in a lot of cases. I know phase 2 of reopening our state is at the end of June - so I’m guessing depending how phase 1 goes they may try and have us back in homes for June 20th. Our state still has 600 new cases coming a day on average so I don’t see it going well."

My fiancé can’t work, he’s disabled and waiting on an SSI hearing so it’s just me trying to make ends meet on one income working 62 hours a week. That check would make things so much easier with the 20% pay cut I had to take."
stimuluscheck,fr1eq7t,t3_gm23xr,1589818429.0,I filed my taxes in March. No refund yet. No stimulus check yet. Payment status unavailable every time I check. I think it’s just a waiting game at this point.
ABA,fqzhns5,t3_glqhwp,1589767584.0,"First, I can tell how hard you’re trying and I think you’re a really good parent. I’m an RBT - but I’m also a full time caregiver for my fiancé who has schizophrenia, so I know being a full time caregiver is extremely hard. There was a point in time after his diagnosis when I really struggled - our extended family fell apart because they couldn’t handle or accept his illness and I was absolutely miserable and suffering from PTSD from his psychotic breaks. Something my therapist told me was that “it’s okay to grieve for the life you thought you’d have”. That simple phrase literally changed everything for me. I have been with my fiancé since high school - and now I’m almost 25. We had all these plans, and now things are very different than I thought. It felt like this horrible thing, that was breaking me at the time, but that’s because I didn’t grieve. It’s okay to feel the way you’re feeling! This probably is not what you expected or planned for you, your partner, or your son’s life - and I think it would help if you let yourself really grieve it. One I took the time to grieve it I was able to push forward. My fiancé is doing better, our relationship is a million times better, and our family is rebuilding their relationship with him after I told them to do the same grieving. I feel like giving yourself that grace to fall apart and really understand your grief may help you get some closure."

ABA,fqj3ljn,t3_gj3337,1589404580.0,BOOM Learning is my biggest asset. I’ve been doing telehealth since the beginning of March and I use it with the majority of my clients. You can make a free teacher account (although there is a premium you can pay for) and you can find free “decks” for everything from social skills to color ID. You can also create your own decks and customize them; then assign them to particular clients. I use this with an age span of literally 3-21.
schizophrenia,fqfj1fw,t1_fqfgtde,1589325780.0,"Honestly because I used to work in a psych ward it didn’t totally phase me because I was used to stuff like that, it more upset me that he was that far gone and didn’t recognize me as myself v a robot version of me. Totally agree - there tend to be big differences in men and women. He’s put on some weight but I’m hoping he’ll put on a little more! He totally wont, even if I fill them. Last time I did that Mountain Dew somehow wound up inside the organizer and the pills dissolved.....-___- my friend gave us a google nest as a gift and I’m setting it up right now actually so that I can send him reminders to do things even if I wasn’t home so I’m hoping that’ll help since he’s really into tech stuff."
schizophrenia,fqfemqn,t1_fqf636z,1589323532.0,"I’m hoping he’ll get consistent with it - I bought him a pill organizer and he left it unopened in his closet. The only reason he’s even taking the antipsychotic anymore is because he threatened to kill me during a major psychotic break (and the president - secret service showed up, it was bad) and I told him I’m not willing to put myself in that kind of danger again so it’s either take the meds or we need some time apart. He’s still in a place where he doesn’t fully accept his illness and doesn’t want to learn about it, so he relies on me and my knowledge to just anticipate his needs or find out the answers to questions he has. I’m working with him on coping skills and they have seemed to help a bit, but it takes a lot of prompting for him to use them, which is to be expected at this point. I’m hoping he puts on a little more weight. He was drinking Ensure and it was helping but now he’s not. He’s eating much better though. He’s always been naturally thin but he’s still about 20 pounds too shy. There are a lot of studies out there about nicotine and sz as well as caffeine actually. I really like this book Surviving Schizophrenja by E Fuller Torrey MD  - there’s a whole chapter on nicotine and caffeine addiction in correlation with schizophrenia. I bet you could easily find a free PDF of the chapter, it’s like one of the better known books and specialists out there. No I don’t mind at all! He’s on Zyprexa. The hospital wanted to switch him to a haldol and Zoloft cocktail since he wasn’t taking either med - but now that he’s taking the zyprexa he dropped it"
schizophrenia,fqf3oa3,t1_fqf2grh,1589318182.0,"My friend’s husband has a psychotic disorder and is on a non habit forming ADD med and she said it’s really helped him (he’s got severe addiction issues), so I’m cautiously optimistic something like that may help but I want to be cautious in general. During his last hospitalization in September he tricked a nurse into giving him Ativan - which he hasn’t touched in yeaaaaars (she should’ve checked his chart.....but whatever), so I’m super cautious with him. The Wellbutrin so far hasn’t made a ton of difference. He also doesn’t take it regularly. He takes his antipsychotic religiously at this point because he’s afraid of being hospitalized again - but not the Wellbutrin or his other optional sleeping pill/antidepressant. I think if he was willing to take it regularly it could help, but we also worry because it can trigger psychosis (I think that’s why he won’t take it consistently). I can totally see why cigarettes are soothing for the both of you. I’m in grad school to become a clinical psychologist and hope to specialize in psychotic disorders and have read a lot of studies about how common nicotine use is and how it can actually help - but he has lung issues and is severely underweight (refused to eat during the worst of his psychosis and dropped down to 86 pounds - and were hovering at 103 now....) so his doctor is trying to get him off of them. Right now he uses a vape pen and the patch on occasion. I’m so sorry you experience panic attacks with quitting that’s terrible and probably makes it so much harder."
schizophrenia,fqewfql,t1_fqevcrg,1589314714.0,"That makes a lot of sense re the lawyer. Hopefully this office is willing to take him on. His psychiatrist won’t give him ADD medication - she thinks he’ll abuse it because he had a problem abusing Ativan as a teen (granted this was before we even started dating so he was like 14... and now he’s in his early 20s). She switched his anti depressant to Wellbutrin saying it would help (nope) and that it would help with him quitting smoking (another nope). Before covid I had found another psychiatrist who would take his state insurance after months of searching but he won’t do a consult until the shelter in place order is over, but I’m hoping he might have something in mind to at least help mitigate the severity of the ADD symptoms."
schizophrenia,fqeub80,t1_fqetk6h,1589313712.0,"I will definitely update! So far I talked to his psychiatrist a little while ago and she said they sent the paperwork and got fax confirmation - so SSI “must’ve glitched” and “they deny people all the time, just appeal it”. I’m going to help him with the process of appealing it when I’m done with appointments tonight. I also found the number of what seems to be a highly rated law office for SSI in our state so I’m going to try and reach them. You said it perfectly - it’s all BS. He really struggles with the lack of motivation and the meds have made his ADD sooo much worse. He also has some tardive dyskinesia from the antipsychotic so he twitches in his legs for hours after he takes it so that makes it hard for him to do much"
schizophrenia,fqetjk9,t1_fqerbts,1589313353.0,"Oh that’s really good to know. I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s contributing. He’s only been on the one antipsychotic but on the highest available dose - and was recommended a different one via injection but he’s afraid of needles and won’t do it. He’s only tried two different antidepressants with it, and he’s off anti anxiety meds because he abuses them. He literally only has that 4 weeks of work under his belt."
schizophrenia,fqer5r0,t1_fqeqihy,1589312232.0,"Thank you, and I’m sorry things have been hard for you guys too. He’s only been consistent with his medication since September, and while he’s not having psychosis symptoms so much anymore, he still has the flat effect and lost most of his ability to function so like there’s just no way he’s ready. What I’m learning from everyone’s responses is that this process seems really similar to worker’s compensation where you’re kind of dammed if you do and if you don’t (in 2018 I worked in a psych ward and was assaulted and left with brain damage - so I can’t work in those settings and it was a huge pay cut to transition from that to the type of therapy I do now). Workers comp wasn’t sending checks, so I started doing this and then they were like BUT YOU CAN DO SOME WORK. Now they’re supposed to pay the wage gap and currently owe me 13,000 but at my hearing last week someone wasn’t present so now we have to redo it next month after waiting a year since the last. I feel like while these institutions are meant to be helpful they kind of screw the people who need the most help. My fingers are crossed for you! I hope things turn around for you both soon."
schizophrenia,fqepkce,t1_fqep1yd,1589311482.0,"I mean so far there hasn’t been a single job recommendation but I’m really worried. He’s only ever worked 4 weeks in his life, and lost that position due to a major psychotic episode during a shift. We’re engaged and I’ve been financially supporting him on my own for years but with covid it’s not viable anymore, I’m an ABA therapist and my patient’s bail on their Telehealth appointments regularly because they don’t take it as seriously so it’s a huge pay cut, and hours are reduced throughout the practice anyways. He’s got so much in medical debt that I’ve been paying off for him for the last year but we’re still not even close to paid off. I’m looking into attorneys now because I’m at such a loss. I’m sorry you’re still going through all that, but you’re not alone. It looks like this is sadly the norm for this."
caregivers,fqe7ji3,t1_fqe79j6,1589303031.0,Yea I think I’m going to have to. He’s been out of work for over 2 years. He can’t even remember to use soap when he showers or stay awake more that 6 hours at a time. He can’t be expected to work. If you have any recommendations for finding a good SSI lawyer please let me know.
ABA,fqe65st,t3_gi3iy9,1589302384.0,"It depends on the needs of the client and program you’re running. My longest sessions pre covid were 3-4 hours 3x a week for one client, but the rest were 2 hours."
schizophrenia,fqdvxyc,t1_fqdvpzf,1589297533.0,Oh so it’s like worker’s comp - that makes a lot of sense. I think we may wind up doing that then because I feel like we’re in for a long road. He’s only been consistently taking his medication since the end of September. He can barely stay awake for 6 hours at a time let alone be expected to hold down a job.
schizophrenia,fqds1dm,t1_fqdrtta,1589295587.0,That’s what I’m afraid of. He hasn’t worked since the beginning of 2018. I support both of us on one income and he had racked up thousands in medical debt for his hospitalizations that I’m still paying off for him.

schizophrenia,fqdr88i,t1_fqdqypc,1589295184.0,"Thank you! Seriously appreciate it. I called and spoke with the front office this morning and even though they have an office app that allows them to upload his records they wouldn’t do it without me speaking with the psychiatrist, and left her a message to call me. She doesn’t usually call back in these situations so I have a feeling I’ll be calling again tomorrow. It complicates things with the shelter in place order here and both he and I are immunocompromised so going there is going to be my last resort. Once you got your paperwork did things go smoothly? It was a shock to us - his case rep told us we’d get a check next month and then we got this letter declining him."
ABA,fplmfal,t3_ge3ygw,1588715357.0,I work over 30 hours of telehealth as an RBT right now. Some of the sessions with my youngest clients are shorter than they were in person - but the insurance companies have been very flexible and understanding that we need to reduce hours. We’re also doing supervision via telehealth. It’s honestly been pretty easy. I’ve been doing this since mid March with very few issues.
ABA,forhr7p,t3_g94ute,1588012444.0,"I work with a lot of older teens and early adults on the spectrum and those who are higher functioning are highly involved in their goals. Most of these guys really need work on social skills and executive functioning so we incorporate their goals for their futures as these particular clients have the ability to live on their own when the time comes.

ABA,fne7e9e,t1_fne6r1c,1586884363.0,"I agree, and I think he’d do well with something like that but it’s not a behavior at home so I’m not sure how we could utilize it since he’s no longer leaving the house. Mom just wants the behavior to stop - but he’s about to age out and without the stimuli there he’s not having the behavior. It would likely have to be something we teach mom as a parent goal (who is not very involved) and have her continue but since he ages out likely right around the time the shelter in place is lifted I’m not sure how effective it would be. He’s already lost access to visiting his brother, the sister in law doesn’t want him in the home or around their daughter - but it doesn’t seem to have been a deterrent. I can’t even get an answer from mom on if this behavior happens when he’s at school or when he’s on school field trips (which there are apparently a lot of). I think my supervisor and I are missing a lot of information too so we’re sitting down on zoom with his mom later to try and ask all these unanswered questions again so we can get a better understanding of what we’re looking at."
ABA,fne65bc,t1_fne5243,1586883738.0,"Yea he understands that and is aware he needs to wait, and can verbalize it. But in the moment it’s an impulsivity thing. He knows and can say and do all the right things at home but he can’t control that impulse in public, and apparently the interventions used in the home are not working in public like reminding him to wait or ask for private time etc. I think some of it is attention seeking based on what we’ve heard from all family members about how he behaves in public vs at home. I’ve worked with teens back when I worked in a psych hospital who needed similar interventions but they’re not easily generalized on a webcam. 

He just started with us. And ages out of the program in 3 months (we’re in a hot spot state - we’ve been told to expect to shelter in place until at least June). Mom wants a miracle which isn’t going to happen, but we’ve never even seen the behavior or physically been there in person because of covid. He has very low executive functioning skills and impulse control, but can understand abstract or difficult concepts and can practice these skills with ease and discuss them as long as he’s not in the real life scenario it seems. We can’t take him out with what’s going on in the world to even get baseline data."

ABA,fmc930i,t3_fud3jy,1585941201.0,"In CT we had to have certain guidelines changed by the state to allow RBTs to do telehealth - which they did, especially because this state has been a shelter in place lockdown state for awhile now. So the RBTs at my company - myself included - have been doing telehealth sessions. That said, lots of families have opted out of services, especially those with younger children because they don’t want to help facilitate. There are also a ton of RBTs and BCBAs who don’t want to do it either. They’re just not working (granted a lot of them are the people who have duel income and do this as a job not necessarily needing the extra money or something). So I’ve been taking on other cases within my company who for whatever reason don’t have a therapist working during quarantine. 

That said - the scheduling coordinator is already asking if I’ll keep these cases after this is over or just go back to my typical case load because of restaffing issues (I’ll be going back to my other part time job in the mornings once this is over) so they’re already stressing about in home and clinic services once this ends and having to redistribute cases. So I get why some of the companies you’re contacting are saying you have to be willing to do the other options as well. I would clarify your state’s covid guidelines and regulations, and clarify with them on these calls what the expectations are during and after."

I also have social skills card games we used to play in person that I’ve kind of altered to be compatible via telehealth whether it’s getting a sibling or parent involved or just the two of us. There’s an app called “either” and it’s silly scenarios like “would you rather do x or y” and I have one of my kiddos answer those but make them really think out and explain their answer to help them work on impulsivity and that’s gone well too."

Squirted honey all over the walls. The door unlocked when I got there. My neighbor works from home and sees everything.

mentalillness,fl0z7vu,t3_flre4c,1584718849.0,"I’m a therapeutic crisis intervention counselor, an ABA therapist and in grad school to become a clinical psychologist - any mental health workers with the mindset that mental health issues are due to people being broken are uneducated at best. I’ve had to take so many classes that talk about how health and mental health are perceptions within society, and that societal expectations are a huge part in the mental health system and diagnostic process. Yes chemical imbalances are very real - I have one and it’s directly correlated with my anxiety disorder. And medication for individuals whose illness or thought processes become harmful to themselves or others is medically necessary - the same way someone with diabetes needs medication to protect themselves, my fiancé needs antipsychotics so he doesn’t become homicidal again. But as someone whose worked in psych hospitals, and works in a therapeutic practice now, medications can be given out like candy by certain individuals in the field - and so can diagnoses. I’ve seen people diagnose others with serious mental illnesses without psych testing, and then we do the testing and it’s not accurate and it’s a label a kid in the hospital has been trying to navigate for years. I think there’s a responsibility for professionals in this field to think rationally and responsibly and unfortunately that doesn’t always happen. Nobody is broken because of any type of anxiety, or stress or emotion or chemical imbalance or trauma etc. you may feel things differently, experience them differently or process them differently but that doesn’t have to be a bad thing. Why are there so many different math formulas people can use to solve the same problem? It’s the same thing. People are made with different formulas. Since my fiancé’s diagnosis with a severe psychotic disorder people treat him like he’s broken (his own psychiatrist made a comment along the lines of “no magic pill to fix him” - were looking for a new one now) but the thing is, he doesn’t need to be fixed, and he’s not broken. He may not be able function on the same level that is socially normative in society (can’t work right now, has trouble with executive functioning like remembering to brush teeth etc) but he’s not broken. He’s the most kind, supportive and loving individual - but people see him looking disheveled on a bad day, or know his diagnosis (very public psychotic break) and ask really uneducated questions or make uneducated comments. I know this is kind of a rant - but my point is nobody is broken. Mental health issues are real, but the way society responds to them in the majority of cases is counter productive. Education breeds understanding and understanding breeds support. If these things were discussed more openly in society there would be a lot less people with the view that people suffering from any type of mental health disorder or struggle are “broken”. Societal views absolutely come into play, but they’re not the end all and be all or necessarily the cause of mental illness - but definitely effect how it’s handled and seen."
Psychosis,fkxhlqq,t1_fkxhffc,1584628332.0,"Of course, if you ever need support you’re welcome to PM me. I’d be surprised if they kept her less than 3 days, but here once you’re admitted to the psych ward it’s rare you’re there less than 5 (on top of the 1-3 you spend in intake when you first arrive)"
ABA,fkxfsib,t1_fkv12pl,1584627193.0,I understand where you’re coming from - that said my company is a multistate establishment where it wouldn’t effect them losing their company. As someone with a supposed over 2 weeks of PTO built up and with an autoimmune disease and lung condition I feel as though it’s wrong to say I can’t take it over very real health concerns.
Psychosis,fkxfl7i,t1_fkwgvd1,1584627064.0,"I think you did the right thing by calling 911. Likely, if you’re in the states, she can’t be discharged for 72 hours. Attempts at jumping off the balcony are likely to be considered being a “danger to herself or others” which means she has to be held on a 5150 psych hold. After the 72 hours they’ll do some evaluations, and if they think she’s still dangerous it’ll become a 5250 where she can be held 2 weeks or more depending on the state, severity and laws. 

In regards to being put in a “facility” - that’s where things get complicated. If she’s over 18 she can’t be forced to go there unless she’s declared incompetent by a court of law. Some hospitals have 28 day or 3 month programs they may keep her for, but not if she’s no longer a danger to herself or others. And if you don’t have money to put her into a private psych facility the odds are she won’t get in to a residential living facility if you tried. As someone who worked in one but for children - each of our patients had to have a minimum of 4 psychological hospitalizations longer than 3 days each, as well as other criteria. When my fiancé had his biggest psychotic break pre medication he threatened to kill me, threatened to kill the president, had to be interviewed by the secret service and repeatedly told staff he was going to kill me after his hospitalization. No facility would take him. They told me he needed a minimum of 4 hospitalizations or multiple arrests plus hospitalizations. I know that likely isn’t what you had hoped to hear but I want to be honest with you about what is common practice in my area (several states surrounding me have similar rules and laws). 

I would wait to see what happens with her current hospitalization. They’ll start her on medications or adjust any she’s already on and try to get her stable. They also release with a treatment plan. So they’ll set her up with an appointment with her (or if she doesn’t have one find her one) psychiatrist and likely a therapist."
Psychosis,fkujpvf,t1_fkuji6u,1584550676.0,Also totally depends. In the past I had a patient in a psych hospital who was a child with a psychotic disorder and it could last less than 25 minutes - or it would last weeks. With my fiancé episodes lasted probably 3 days to 2 weeks average.
Psychosis,fkuj7jk,t1_fkuixsq,1584550415.0,"I think it depends on the situation and the individual. I don’t leave my fiancé alone when he’s in psychosis but that’s because he typically gets homicidal tendencies. However, medicated, he hasn’t had an episode since September"
Psychosis,fku2tok,t3_fklx05,1584541006.0,I really like Milt Greeks Blueprint for Schizophrenia book - it could be applicable for a variety of psychotic disorders as the main focus is what psychosis can be like and how loved ones can better understand. Between that and what I know from working in the psych field it’s majorly helped me be able to provide care for my fiancé. Try and remember her reality isn’t invalid. There are psychological theories that talk about the shared reality vs personal realities - her personality reality is extremely different than yours but that doesn’t mean it’s not real to her.
ABA,fku2hww,t3_fkpyat,1584540795.0,"I’ve subbed for another therapist when she went on vacation and I did two very brief sessions to meet the client while she was there so he could adjust to me, and then pretty much dove in with nothing but his program binder. It was fine, but a little like being thrown to the sharks especially since that particular staff member did not properly record data."
ABA,fku2cem,t1_fkteog9,1584540695.0,I completely agree with everything you just said. We have the same work from home system - and as a BT with heath issues that cause me to be at higher risk I’m terrified that I’m going into these homes everyday even though my doctor told me not to. I need to be able to pay my bills. Corporate brushed me off when I emailed about my health concerns. I emailed our state governor today begging them to step in. I’m planning on resigning once all this is over and other companies start hiring again because I’m so disappointed in the way the company has handled everything - especially the concerns of staff who are immunocompromised.

ABA,fko03ko,t3_fjniu1,1584377444.0,My company said if you don’t work you don’t get paid. That said I have a lung condition. So I’m at more risk.

It’s insane that there’s no infrastructure to try and combat this. Even if they just have the employees half their average pay at least it’s something.

They privately emailed my supervisor to say it’s “business as usual”. I have a lung condition. I’m at higher risk for corona. I get pneumonia regularly and am hospitalized for it. We don’t get sick time. We don’t have benefits. And my fiancé is schizophrenic and can’t work - so I’m a caregiver for work and at home too. I can’t afford to lose the paychecks, but I also can’t afford to get corona. I don’t know what we do from here."
ABA,fknti7m,t1_fknspv4,1584373592.0,"No. No they don’t. Honestly like I try to never speak badly about anyone or anything - especially my workplace but it’s chaos. I’ve posted to see if anyone has had similar experiences in the aba therapy community but it seems that my company is just a raging shit show based on the comments I get from other in the industry. Our branch in this state is fairly new. We’re like just over a year old. And they don’t have a contingency plan for anything. They decided we needed to implement a cancellation policy at Christmas time - and for two months we asked them how to collect the fee (we were all thrilled about this) and last week they finally fessed up after ignoring us and brushing us off that they did this without thinking and there is no way to enforce it. It’s so ridiculous. I’m babysitting for my friend right now (who has a newborn so is very cautious and has her whole family on lockdown - so I’m not scared about being here watching the kids while she and her husband work from home in the basement) but doing this regularly isn’t going to match what I make as an aba therapist. 

That’s smart. I’ll definitely look into that too. I also know that they just passed that bill where companies under 500 employees are required to provide 12 weeks of 67% paid leave for employees “affected by the virus” - but I can’t find what the definition of affected by the virus means...because I’ll quote that bill in my email to HR. I may not have corona but I am affected by it. One of my neighbors was so offended I had gloves on yesterday and didn’t want to shake his hand and I was like IM IMMUNO COMPROMISED DUDE. I won’t go to the grocery store. My dad ordered a ton of stuff from Omaha steak to ship to me food wise and I’ve been using prime. So like I’m still affected..."
ABA,fknrzvp,t1_fknqtq8,1584372692.0,"My supervisor knows but corporate is actually based out of another state so they don’t know (and don’t answer my emails). The CEO keeps sending out emails to reach out to your doctor for personal concerns and don’t work if your sick - and that they’re working on telehealth capabilities (expect apparently they’re not). 

I do really wonder if my little guy has it because his symptoms line up. No immune conditions I know of for him - but he gets sick at the drop of a hat. Like for months the wind blows and he gets a fever so even though he’s a child and it’s less likely I feel that’s probably it. His mom said he couldn’t even stay awake the first few days and now a week and a half later he apparently still has the cough and fatigue but no fever (we’re not doing sessions they had an insurance issue come up so that worked out, but I saw him the day before he got the 101+ fever).

We don’t get PTO or sick time. Even if you’re on salary you’re expected to make up all hours (I’m not on salary. I was promised full time when I started and then after they told me they didn’t actually have full time available). I’m going to call my doctor and ask her to get real with me about the risk and if she tells me I have to stop doing face to face sessions then I’m going to have to talk to HR. They have no system for those of us who could get sick and still need a paycheck (or even half! I’d take half!) who aren’t on salary. I’m at such a loss of what to do here. We literally can’t make rent without the paycheck (I’m also a caregiver to someone with schizophrenia who can’t work and isn’t getting his social security checks - were waiting to hear what the deal is with that) so I also have someone else extremely sick to worry about. Part of me feels like I don’t have a choice but to work until I get sick.

Actually we do have an Aldi’s in town - but I’m not sure if my doctor is going to tell me I have to like self quarantine altogether or not. But it’s good to know that could be an option."
