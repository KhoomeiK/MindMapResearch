Establishment of community diagnostic testing sites is powered through a partnership between the State of California with OptumServe, the federal government health services business of Optum, a leading health services innovation company.  A nasal or throat swab will be collected and specimens will be sent to a FDA approved laboratory for COVID-19 PCR testing.

>**Testing will be by appointment only.** Appointments can be made by calling 1-888-634-1123 or visiting https://lhi.care/covidtesting. Please note that phone registration will only be used for people without internet access. Individuals will need to provide their insurance card and valid identification at the time of check-in. A unique identification number will be provided for those that do not have a valid identification. For those without any insurance, the State will cover the full cost of testing.

Also, please keep in mind that it's your right to request an evaluation, no matter what teachers or school personnel say.

Edit: Homeschool charters generally allow you freedom to use your own curriculum, so you would still be homeschooling for the most part. You'd have some oversight, but I've felt like it was worth it to get funding to support your efforts and SPED services."

AskParents,fn7hq3j,t3_fztuva,1586720559.0,"I tell my kids several times a day.  I want them to know that I love them always.  When we're watching a movie, when I'm cooking dinner, when I drop them off at practice.  

I am 40 and I tell my mom I love her every time I talk to her.  It is a weird thing with her.  She doesn't like to say it first, because she feels that if she says it first, the other person is just responding out of politeness.  (She also won't call first on Christmas or Thanksgiving and just waits it out to see who really wants to call her - it's not healthy, but it is what it is.)  So it's almost always me saying it and her responding.  That's okay.  I know she loves me by her actions.  I feel like it's the same as with my kids.  I just want her to know that I love her, regardless of whatever is going on."

I lived in the South up until a couple of years ago. This is completely true. I was overweight (but not obese) and I went to the doctor for my checkup. I fully expected him to talk to me about my weight. Nope! I was told that I was at a good, healthy weight. I guess in comparison, I was? Moved to the West Coast and at my first appointment here got the talk I expected. (And made changes and now have a healthy BMI.)"
