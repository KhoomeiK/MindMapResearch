At least for me, my ED gets a lot worse when I am stressed. The same thing happened to me last year when I was studying, and my one piece of advice would be if you are ready/feel comfortable/are able, try to talk to a professional. I got so bad last year that I could barely function and it ended up being the push I needed to go and get help..so kind of a blessing in disguise. I am lucky to have a doctor who is very supportive, but I understand that isn’t the case for everyone so if that isn’t an option, having a friend or family member (or random redditor) to talk to could help you feel less overwhelmed. The other thing I would say is just hang in there, as hard as it is right now, the extra stress of exams will pass, and hopefully you’ll find that things improve once it does. Good luck ❤️"
