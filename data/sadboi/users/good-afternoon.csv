EtherMining,fpomdob,t1_fpokamj,1588786925.0,"Honestly MPT isn't bad because you don't need 90% of the settings... or at least I didn't. If you were to use it, you just select your GPU and then there's settings like max clock speed (think it's 2150) and you can edit those. Same with the fan speed... anyway, my point is it isn't as arduous as it sounds!

I'm using newest beta drivers and (after using MPT once) I set my OC on every boot with the latest beta MSI Afterburner. Custom fan curve in MSI Afterburner is important as well since if you're minin the VRAM temp will be like 98 while the GPU hotspot will only read like 80 and the edge temp like 68; meaning the fan won't run fast enough. I'm also running Windows 10 insider build (Fast Ring) on a 2015 Macbook Pro with the 5700 in an external box.

I overclock the GPU/VRAM to 1950/1750 personally. I found that to be the most stable. Get 300fps in half life 2 with all the max settings and I mine on the downtime so it works well. Also keep in mind though, im basically running gthe XT bios on a non-XT card, so you can probably push higher. 1950/1850, 2000/1750 and higher seemed to cause a crash after about an hour of intense use."
