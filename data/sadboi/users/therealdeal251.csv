dating_advice,fn8obiz,t3_g01byt,1586746220.0,"I agree with what was said here. But I also do think that this is more about you than it is about whatever relationship you may have with her. 

You can - and should - be nice without being ‘overly’ nice. Being “too nice” shouldn’t be a thing, but it is. I’m a 25f and can tell you that in the beginning stages of talking to someone, I personally don’t like it to be too intense or to feel like I have to talk to that person constantly. Checking in with her and asking her about her day probably means a lot to her in times like these, but she is also probably under a lot of stress/pressure and I would assume is in need of some personal space. 

With that being said, I would suggest checking in on her every few days and not every day. Give her the space and time to think, “haven’t heard from x in a while”. You don’t need to make yourself more desirable. You seem like a lovely guy and that in itself should make you desirable. Be confident. That’s the most attractive quality in a person. 

I would also suggest taking up different tasks/hobbies around the house. Workout, do some yoga, meditate, paint, drink some wine... just things that show you’re busy and have real interests. Post stories on Instagram showing some of what you’re up to. Not only does that show you have things going on in your life, but it also gives you guys something to talk about. You guys could very well have common interests that haven’t yet been discussed, and this could be a good window for her to initiate conversation. 

Again, be confident. Show her you care but don’t over do it. And do things for yourself. Not only will you feel better for doing it, but it also makes for good conversation starters."
dating_advice,fmvi6fg,t3_fxklov,1586417860.0,"This post weighed heavily on me because I could sense the hurt in your words. I can also tell how big of an impact this is having on your self esteem. I am sorry you are feeling this way. 

I would like to start out by saying that you seem very self aware, and that makes me pretty much positive that this has nothing to do with the way you look. Which in turn, brings me to question how you interact with men. Did you think that the dates you went on were good dates? Did you have a real interest in those men? And what type of men do you tend to go for? Those are all things  that you should evaluate in order to see if you are following a pattern that isn’t necessarily a good one for you. You can’t expect a different outcome if you always play your cards the same. 

It could easily just be that you’re investing your time into the wrong people. It could also be that you want something to workout so badly that you are willing to look past obvious red flags that the men on the other end are not. You could be leaving these dates wanting a second one without maybe even realizing that the dates weren’t that good or that you weren’t all that compatible with those people. Or you could just be giving them the impression that you’re too eager or not eager enough. You really need to look inwards and pay attention to those details in order to better understand how you are interacting with those people. 

You’re 22, you’re just now starting to get to know who you are as a person. I know I only started to work on that when I was around your age. You’re a mutable being and even more so at this age, so take advantage of that. If there’s something about you that you would like to better or change, this is the perfect time to do that. Just make sure you’re making these changes for yourself and not for anyone else. From personal experience, you will feel most wanted and desirable when you least need that validation. It’s a shitty cycle, but your energy truly changes once you’re comfortable and happy with who you are, flaws and all.

I feel like it would have been one thing for Rebecca to pick someone who siannise só happened to be interested in once. But that was the second time that had happened and Siannise was very respectful about it the first time. 

Rebecca should have had a conversation with her beforehand just to be like “hey, I hate that we are in this situation yet again, but I have to do this for me and I hope that you can understand”. And I’m sure Siannise would have been upset but understanding of the situation. 

Siannise simply tried telling her that she would have preferred to not be kept her in the dark about it but Rebecca just refused to listen to what Siannise had to say or apologize. She repeatedly interrupted her and was extremely defensive about it, which is what lead to the argument being completely blown out of proportion. 

I can admire someone who is able to admit fault even if it wasn’t their intention to hurt the other person, and that was not the case with Rebecca at all. She came across as extremely selfish, stubborn, and like she lacks empathy. Putting men first won’t take her far in life and I really respect Siannise for standing up for herself.

Your daughter should be your priority always, even if that means upsetting Kate. I also understand that your child is only three, but you need to find a way to communicate with her and show her that she can and should eat whatever the hell she wants. You need to break those ideas that Kate put in her head regarding weight and food before this becomes something she is constantly aware of.

askatherapist,f97jkwt,t3_e45ocx,1575166466.0,"Not a therapist (yet) - but someone being unpleasant and rude doesn’t necessarily imply there’s something wrong with them, and most definitely does not mean they have a personality disorder. 

It could be that your sister is just “programmed” that way, and from what you described, could even be acting a certain way without realizing it.  Her rudeness may not be as transparent to her as it is to you. Often times people are rude and unpleasant without even realizing it - it’s not always their intention. Sometimes bluntness can be mistaken for rudeness, and so forth. 

Or it could be that she just doesn’t care. It could also be that she feels a certain way in that environment and is acting a certain way to draw attention to herself. The possibilities are endless and my guess is that you won’t be able to figure that out just by interacting with her.

I would assume your sister doesn’t necessarily act that way towards every single person in her life. Maybe get someone she is close to to try to have a conversation with her, get her to open up. If you have a strained relationship with your sister, you telling her she should see a therapist would not be received very well.

askatherapist,f8xj83i,t3_e2qvbb,1574920565.0,"(Correct me if I’m wrong), but from what I understand, existencial psychotherapy is about us taking responsibility for our actions and learning that we are in control of our story. In therapy, I believe the whole point of it is for us to deconstruct anything we attribute as being “fixed” or immutable. For example, instead of saying you ARE impatient or you ARE aggressive, the idea is to change that narrative to “I can be impatient” or “I can be aggressive” but that’s not something that you are/have to be all the time. It’s about showing you that you are fully in charge or your narrative and you can change it at any given moment. Just because you “always” respond to things in a certain way, it doesn’t mean that you are that way, or that you have to be.


Edit: the part where she agrees that you did in fact have a lonely childhood, to me seems like she is validating something that was true to you. But in repeating “in your childhood” i think it’s a way of saying, “yes, you were lonely then” but you aren’t lonely now.

I’ve always heard people saying the same but regarding romantic relationships - “hooking up is easy but getting into a relationship is what is tough”. I feel like the same applies to friendships... you need to dedicate time to the right people in order to have the effort reciprocated. Whenever people invite you to things, even if you’re not necessarily in the mood, go. Similarly, if there’s something you want to do, invite someone you think might be interested in joining. The best way to establish a deeper connection is with one-on-one time. So I would suggest doing that rather than organizing a get together - that’s the type of environment where you won’t be able to dig too deep, it tends to be a lot more superficial. I would also suggest you find a common interest between you and the people you meet. Something you both love, admire, or even dislike. That’s an easy way to establish a bond with someone."

With that, people with serious disorders tend to dismiss their issues, think that they are “not a big deal” and/or are easily manageable, when it’s not always the case.

This relationship doesn’t establish itself over night - it takes time and energy from both sides. You most likely feel as though you have found a friend in her, and someone who truly understands you. Having that taken from you SHOULD be upsetting. 

However, it is important for you to understand that, given the circumstances, she would not be able to be there for you at this time. She’s doing what needs to be done, not only for her sake, but for yours too. 

I understand that the thought of starting therapy all over again with someone new isn’t ideal, but it’s what needs to happen - at least for now. Like you said, on top of your regular struggles, you feel like you’re grieving at this time. This could be a big stressor, and therapy could be of great help at this time.

That should give him a sense of power and make him feel like he is more in control of the situation, and should help him ease out of the state he is in. 

Other than that, they both need to see therapists separately. She needs someone that will help her cope with her illnesses, and he needs someone that will not only help him help her, but also himself. 

And lastly, just talk to him. Remind him what a great parent he is. That he has done everything he could to help. That he is in no way responsible for her illnesses. And that he needs to be strong for both her and himself. That she needs a dad that can be present not only physically, but mentally.

It could be that she is using suggestive language to steer you in a different direction. Most therapists won’t flat out speak their mind or give you their own opinion, especially if it hasn’t been asked and/or is not a conflicting decision in your mind. Instead, she might be trying to get you to see things from her own point of view (in this case, disagreeing with your decision), without having to say it. 

You’re young, and have just started treatment for a disorder. It could be that your therapist just thinks it would be more beneficial for you to live a more vanilla, stable lifestyle while you undergo treatment. If you take on this adventure, it could be that you would miss out on some serious progress in therapy. 

Remember, you can always ask your therapist these questions. Ask her to be more direct when you need her to. I believe she just wants you to be able to make this decision for yourself without imposing her beliefs, but it’s also her job to make you question your decisions and thought process. That’s how she will grow to understand you as a person."

I understand and respect you wanting to help someone who is a very important part of your life. But instead of thinking of ways you could help him, think of ways you could help yourself. Is keeping this close of a relationship with someone who “doesn’t know what they want” having a healthy impact in your life? He’s trying to work on himself, but are you doing the same for yourself? Like you said, he’s a completely different person, and therefore different from the person you fell in love with. Maybe what worked so well for 10 years wouldn’t work too well at this time. I think that sometimes the best thing we can do for ourselves and for the other person is to distance ourselves and let nature take its course. When you’re ready both mentally and financially, I think therapy could be of great help :)

Edit: must add, am a soon-to-be therapist, am not one yet."
BipolarReddit,f5v8qij,t3_dpedf3,1572485261.0,"Coming from a soon to be therapist, it’s nothing personal and has nothing to do with you or the bond the two of you have created over the years. When a therapist feels like he/she isn’t helping you to the best of their ability, or feels as though there is someone out there who could be doing a better job at helping you with any issue you might be facing, they are supposed to do that and refer you to someone else. Could be for a number of reasons such as: they could realize that whatever issue you’re dealing with could be outside of their area of expertise; they could think that after a number of days, months or years of working together, they have done everything they could/are no longer able to help you progress; there could be something conflicting about your relationship, such as: you could be having a hard time opening up about certain things because you now see them as your friend rather than a therapist, your schedules might be conflicting, etc. I think bottom line is, they have made this decision because they think that, for whatever reason, you can do better than what they are able to do for you at this moment. See it as a positive. I know starting therapy all over again with someone who doesn’t know you at all isn’t easy. But you could be very pleasantly surprised :)"
askatherapist,f5omvcx,t1_f5ocuhl,1572323015.0,"Agree with what was said here. If this is something you can add to your life that will bring you happiness, and it’s not damaging in anyway, then sure, why not? But it is important to understand that this is in no way a replacement to real treatment. This can work as a distraction. But a distraction is just that. I don’t think it’s something you should be ashamed of. You’re not hurting yourself or anyone in doing this. That being said, you need to make sure that this doesn’t become a problem for you financially. If you’re everyday going out and buying new toys, that could very well become an issue. Play with the ones you already have. Seek treatment. If you’re unhappy with the services you were provided with at that particular place, look for a different one. And remember, if you can find the time to get dressed, drive to Walmart to buy toys and play with them, you can also find an hour out of your week to see a therapist! It’s a matter of prioritizing what you think will be most effective in the long run"

relationship_advice,f1akrc8,t3_d85ds6,1569296856.0,"That’s sleep paralysis. I’ve had a few episodes too and it’s sometimes quite hard to tell if what you experienced was a dream or reality. Seeing how this was your first time, it makes sense that you were scared and thought it to be real. 

If I were you, I would explain to her what you experienced. Read about sleep paralysis, show her what you’ve found. And explain that you had just woken up, afraid, and thinking you were momentarily paralyzed. That you asking her if she had sneaked out, was also a means of confirming if you did in fact suffer from said paralysis or if it was all a dream. 

She should be understanding of the fact that you weren’t just blatantly accusing her of something, but rather trying to understand what had just happened to you. 

Hope this helps."
BipolarReddit,ezwaqnz,t3_d2nne7,1568212261.0,"The most important part you have already nailed down, which is recognizing the fact that you need help and have needed it for a long time. At times like these, no one can help you unless you are willing to let them. This post in itself is a cry for help. You realize you have an issue. You wish you had taken care of it before. But you didn’t. And you can now. 

Take advantage of the clarity you have at this moment. Get help."

socialskills,ez8ngq9,t3_d0a6qp,1567749948.0,"Probably not the answer you’re looking for, but you can do both at the same time! Crying won’t take away from what you have to say. You can absolutely stand up for yourself and shed a few tears while doing it. I, too, tend to cry out of frustration or even anger. But make sure you’re still able to say what you need to say. You’ll be respected for it and you’ll feel better for doing it. With time, it gets better. Hope it works out for you!"

Alex has also mentioned multiple times that she has never even had a one night stand, usually takes her like 2 months of “dating” before she will fuck a guy. Milf hunter has never even taken someone on a date. You do the math"
