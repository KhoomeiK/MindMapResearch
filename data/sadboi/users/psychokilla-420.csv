bipolar2,fqoq1pw,t3_gjy9d3,1589521556.0,Wow. (20F) and I felt and understood everything in your post. It honestly sucks because you assume that’s all everyone knows and you have to pretend to be that way even when you’re severely depressed. Or maybe sometimes your depression seeps through and you come off as weird or dry to them and they think you’ve changed over time. You’re not alone. xx
TooAfraidToAsk,fqftdi8,t3_gic6av,1589331314.0,"It's funny because my dad forces my mom to apologize for her actions. She just told me that the reason I've been hospitalized for depressive episodes 3 times over the past 3 years is my fault and my fault only. She said that with a smile on her face and later told me she was sorry. Her ""apology"" was accompanied by her saying that she was testing me to see if I was actually bipolar. To which she said she was now convinced and that I should forgive her. To be completely honest, I'd rather take no apology over the fake shit I just heard. Just me lol."
SuicideWatch,fqd3u8e,t3_ghjgnt,1589278803.0,I don't know if everyone will see this but I just want to say that when I wrote this post I did not expect to receive such a tremendous amount of support from you all. Listening to your stories and supporting comments made a positive impact on me. I just want to say thank you to all who took the time to read and relate to my post. Thank you for the support you offered. It means a lot. Wish you all nothing but happiness and hope that anyone struggling also realizes they are not alone. <3
SuicideWatch,fqbhesf,t1_fq9pcvw,1589237028.0,"I will definitely look into it! Thank you for your recommendation. (: However, I am taking Depakote and Seroquel at the moment so I don't know if introducing a new drug is a good idea without doctor approval. :|"
SuicideWatch,fqbh405,t1_fq9a1ix,1589236867.0,"I'm taking Depakote (mood stabilizer) and Seroquel as a sleep aid. I may need to increase my dosage as I have been on the same dose for almost 2 years. I was looking into CBD yesterday but it's a bit on the pricey side. Also, I live in Ontario, Canada and the waitlist to see a psychiatrist is around 6 months. So there's that. :|"
SuicideWatch,fqbgpri,t1_fqbdfhf,1589236655.0,I get what you mean but he can't handle it. I know how much he loves me. We're talking about a guy that didn't even tear up at his dad's (my grandpa's) funeral and celebrated the life he lived instead. My dad full on cried when I was hospitalized at age 15. The social worker at the hospital told me later that he had never witnessed any father cry that hard for their child in his 10+ years at the in-patient mental health unit. He also told me to feel lucky. This is what I mean. This is what I consider the hardest part. How do I tell someone so positive and happy that I feel like this? He'd just die inside and I would have myself to blame.
SuicideWatch,fqbg3wb,t1_fq9j82n,1589236331.0,"I'm so sorry to hear about that. I do agree that I am fortunate enough to have a father who cares about me but the fact he cares so much hurts me because I don't want to ever hurt him. He's like an innocent, wholesome dude who tries to crack jokes to make me laugh. He doesn't know what to say or do when I'm upset. It hurt so much seeing him tear up because he believes in happiness and he'll casually say, ""life is good"" and really mean it.  I wish I could turn these thoughts off and appreciate what I have because after reading these comments, I feel beyond fortunate. However, it's unfortunate that despite having him in my life, I still think my life is meaningless. Stupid brain. Thank you for your reply and thank you for sharing. I hope you feel better soon too. 

Ps. Your emoji's made my day. (: <3"
bipolar2,fp8fbhr,t3_gbnqk9,1588390853.0,"Woah, did I ghostwrite this? Aha no but seriously, I totally understand this and how tiring it is. We set such high expectations for ourselves and need to live up to them just to feel worthy of simply existing. I think I'm a total nutbag when I do this because I'm constantly making myself more and more upset when I fail to meet said expectations or do something I laid my eyes on. I think this quarantine really intensified the expectations, even if they're just hobbies, and it's just draining. \*sigh\* I hope you find some comfort knowing that there are many like you who lay out stuff to do or set high expectations and never end up achieving them. Your post definitely helped me."
bipolar2,fp7p6ol,t1_fp7e10q,1588374952.0,"I felt this. My ex actually ended up cheating on me and blamed my illness for it. Best feeling ever. :))) Still haven't recovered but posts like these give me hope that there are true, understanding, and loving people out there. Hope we find them. Hang in there."

bipolar,flzky00,t3_frstq6,1585626209.0,I was having a tough time meeting all these deadlines for school during this HELL of depressive episode and seeing this actually made my night. I feel so seen (if you know what I mean). Thanks for posting this.
insomnia,flq2p0r,t1_flq21lw,1585376801.0,"I have the same issue regarding vivid dreams and I feel like it’s something that hasn’t gone away for me. However I’ve gotten used to it. But before I used to have a lot of trouble telling the difference between a dream and reality, it was scary indeed. Good luck, you’re gonna get through this!! If it helps you sleep and you wake up feeling okay then I guess it’s a good sleep aid for you & you’ll get used to the negative side effects over time. (:"
insomnia,flq0aeo,t3_fqc9a9,1585374358.0,"Heyyyy, don't worry. It happens. You can try a bunch of things to help knock you out sooner but I'm sure you're gonna crash eventually. Listen to deep sleep playlists, podcasts, read a really boring book (try to) & take a hot bath or shower. Also, if you can't sleep, don't stay in bed, go into a different room & pick up a book or do something else. Good luck. May you drift into sleep soon! (:"

insomnia,flpzcd7,t3_fq9zar,1585373456.0,I don't remember ever sleeping well. I guess getting diagnosed with bipolar 2 & a bunch of comorbid disorders gave me a reason but I don't think knowing really helps. xD
UTM,fllmbzi,t1_fllc42t,1585263280.0,It was beyond harsh considering the time limit. However I don’t think the prof will do anything about it cuz the first tests average was in the 70s & higher than past years (from what I heard)

But I often think about this. The fact we can't sleep without Quetiapine is a frightening and upsetting feeling. I really hope you can get a refill soon. 

Take care, you can get through this. I believe in you. (:"

In my case - will pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce degree (specialization in Accounting) and then obtaining the CPA and other designations (MFACC at UofT) suffice? I mean, I’ll obviously have to gain accounting work experience but do I need an undergraduate specialization in forensic science as well?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!"
