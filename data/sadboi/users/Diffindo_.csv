booksuggestions,fjnzn0n,t3_fefyz2,1583517540.0,"I know they aren't technically very cheerful, but you could try Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre? You've got aspects of romance in both and really engaging stories to carry you along. Similarly, The Great Gatsby or To Kill a Mockingbird (I guess not really romantic but the writing is super accessible)?

Also, maybe if you feel like you're getting nowhere with classic literature suggestions you could suggest reading some Shakespeare? They could take turns reading scenes within the group which could help to engage them a bit more, although maybe that's straying too far from the Book Club format.

Classic children's literature could also be a good starting point! Little Women, Anne of Green Gables, Treasure Island, Alice in Wonderland, The Secret Garden, Goodnight Mister Tom, The Hobbit, the Narnia series... the list is endless for classic children's books that adults can still enjoy. 

Last suggestion, you could go the mystery/detective route and suggest some Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie novels or The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins. Good luck, what you're doing is so worthwhile!"
bipolar,fg4f3sq,t1_ffqsqn4,1580502253.0,"Thank you so much for sharing your experiences. You're really strong for being able to handle the challenges of living with bipolar and accepting the realities in such a balanced way. I think I'm still not quite there regarding seeing bipolar as a feature, not a definition, as you put it - so much of the time it seems so overwhelming and I can't see past it to my own separate identity. Reading about people managing the condition as well as you do really helps, sending you all the best to keep going!"
bipolar,fg4e66d,t1_ffqworp,1580501809.0,Thank you for your reply and for sharing your story! Honestly it means so much to hear about others having similar experiences. I really believe that the experience of living with bipolar allows for empathy and insight that the mental health field needs for its practitioners - I'm sure that your own perspective adds to your value as a therapist. Good luck with everything and sending good thoughts!

wokekids,ffn96q3,t1_ffmy059,1580063309.0,"Speaking baby talk isn't harmful, especially to very young babies. Research shows that parents of different cultures globally have developed it independently to each other, and there's evidence to suggest that the way baby talk emphasises important words within sentences helps babies pay attention to the speaker. Normal talk is good too though, basically any positive interaction is helpful!"

relationship_advice,ey26yoi,t1_ey21brt,1566727872.0,"Don't worry about it, if you're happy and you feel that you've made the most sensible and healthy decision for yourself and your relationship that's the most important thing! It sounds like you put thought into the decision to move in and didn't do it out of impulse or with unrealistic expectations.   
Statistics about relationships (and generally) should be guiding factors, not hard and fast rules to apply to every aspect of your life - they capture trends in a population, not every individual difference in every single couple. Just because most of the time moving in together works best when people wait 6 months doesn't mean that is the case for you. Good luck to you both!"
nextfuckinglevel,ey23rme,t1_ey1hsco,1566723032.0,"It's not really a study that needs double blindness, it's just that the title incorrectly describes it as one. I think it would have to be written up as a case study to have any validity though because the main flaws lie in the fact it has a sample size of one and no control group/measures."
drawing,ewfe8s4,t3_cnxubt,1565358717.0,"It's a really great picture but I would seriously think twice about what you're doing here. If my SO went through my art and not only posted a picture without my knowledge or permission, but also shared that I was self-conscious about my abilities, I would honestly consider it such a huge violation. Regardless of how positive the comments are, I don't think you should expect a happy reaction from your gf if you show her this post."

It's more like a piece of art, in my opinion not a particularly good or interesting piece, but let's stop playing into the hands of media outlets who want to piss off and divide people by using emotive and misleading language in their headlines for clickbait."
bipolar,eq7o85f,t3_bxh64o,1559850329.0,So happy for you! Congratulations and thank you for the hope and inspiration your post brings!
