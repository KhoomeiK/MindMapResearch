If you have money you can use it to learn how to interact with women. But never let these women in your life. And this will be the hard part. 

These women are professionals at this. They will tell you everything you want to hear. And they will make it seem that she is the greatest person on this planet. They know your weak spot and manipulating you into anything she wants will be the easiest thing to do.

Myself, I wake up with unbelievable morning wood. But when it comes to having sex there is zero things happening. I haven't had sex in years so sex is actually the one thing I truly crave. So it is not that either. 

There is a woman I only need to think about to have an erection. But for some reason I cannot get an erection when we tried to have a one night stand. 

My doctor thinks it is psychological and I agree. But I can  tell you that every time I cannot get it up when trying to have sex is a painful experience that you want to avoid. Every time the pressure gets bigger and bigger. And I don't have a loving wife to disappoint so the pressure is far greater for him than for me. 

Maybe not the answer you were looking for but maybe understanding how he feels helps. 

Maybe one tip. Try to have him work out. It will build testosterone and thus give a higher sex drive. Just make it sound like it's his idea instead of yours. That works better."

What I want to say is that you never know. Also try not to rely on dating apps. The algorithm I stacked against you so don't let rule your dating life. Did you know the more you swipe, the less women will see your profile? Did you also know that these apps will also show your profile less if you swipe women that are not perceived as high quality? Those apps are terrible for confidence. 

I think you may not have experience with women so try approaching women. If you don't have the confidence, still try to approach women. You can also try to learn how to do that. 

For example learn to go to women and ask for directions (even if you know the way perfectly). That's all. Don't ask for numbers or anything, just directions. Once you get more comfortable approaching try to ask for directions and add something funny and see if you can make them laugh. It will teach you to interact with women and make them like you. Eventually you learn how interact with women. 

I have never tied this but how about using the app meetup and meet people that like what you like in person. If you choose the right subjects there will be women aroubd to interact with. 

Don't give up."

The big difference is that men have nowhere to hold for help.

Yes, girls are in general more passive but not always. But my advice is to not care about that at all. It is your own actions. 

I see plenty of times guys talk to girls for hours without anything happening. Why? Because she perceives it as a conversation between buddies. 

Girls can easily think that you are not interested in them. That you just see them as just another person. 

So make that conversation a bit more hot. Let her do the talking but you set the tone for the conversation. 

Just think about it how different the conversation will be if you ask her what her favorite brand of washing powder is versus if she has ever done something she would never tell her parents.

Trust me, talking about secret stuff can get very sexy very easily. Just do not tell about any of your exes!!!"

It may sound weird but trust me on it. And if I do get lucky my penis will not work. So by now I have not had sex in many years. Which is also making me more depressed.

But if I am right he needs to put porn and masturbation behind him. This is  not easy because it is easy to fall back. I had a porn addiction as well. I had to distance myself from any sexual images for a few months. Otherwise I would fall back to old behaviors. 

For him it will be more difficult. I did not have a girlfriend that gives me sexual stimulation and make me go back to masturbation. So your behavior will also be important. I also did not grow up with a lifetime of unlimited porn.

Let her know that however big your dick is, it will never be bigger than a baby. Talk or show her that some women like to be fisted and that the vagina can stretch that far. That may take some of the girth anxiety away. 

I advise to let her go on top. This way she can control the sex and get used to the size. 

She may not be afraid of the size but maybe of what you will do with your size. Maybe she thinks you will be too rough on her and will use her cervix as a punching bag. Maybe in interaction you give off that vibe. In that case, work on your technique and let her know that you will be the best thing in her life/pussy."

Once give her that pleasure at some point she won't be able to resist. She will give it a try. Maybe not that day, but she will. Especially if you can communicate in a non verbal way that you know what you are doing. And if you can make her feel safe and comfortable

Anyway, Jason Luv is only an inch longer than me but he looks a mile longer than me. I guess it's true what they have been saying since the beginning of time. The camera adds 5 inches."
bigdickproblems,f95hxro,t1_f94jsl0,1575128115.0,It's good to hear this from the opposite side. I wonder  if women judge their own breast size wrong as well and that us men can (from our angle) judge it better.
relationships,f92yujw,t3_e3f1g7,1575045479.0,"I have never seen punishing your partner by not having sex have any sort of good outcome. 

I am not saying you don't have good reasons. But what I am saying is, is this situation the outcome you wanted? 

I say you talk and you solve it or you get out of there.

About him. Of course he is lying to you. 

About solving it. Have sat with him and talked about the problems? And if so, have ever considered to have a 3rd neutral person help you two out?"
NarcissisticAbuse,f8ydt7c,t3_e2iemu,1574945586.0,"I can relate. She was so sweet to everybody that you cannot imagine that this person could be so horrible to you without you giving a very good reason to her to act this way. 


I thought I was imaging things. I started to to doubt if I had caused the friction between us. Also the person made me believe I was seeing things and that every thing was fine between us. 

Then one day I spoke to two of her so called friends. They said they just tolerated her and they disliked how she treated me.

 It felt like I was suddenly liberated. I feel so much better. Also she lost all power over me. I now understand that this is what a narc operates. 

Maybe you should try to look for answers in a different way. Maybe you also find out that the other people don't like him that much."

adultery,f8dpkl0,t3_e0e9nb,1574503581.0,Being scared is how people end up in bad marriages with 2 to 4 children. Taking risks is how people become happy.
depression_help,f8dph28,t3_e0ds5d,1574503409.0,"I think you don't feel anything because you don't want to feel bad. It sort of a protection system. 

Try to do things you feel passionate about. Sports maybe? Or watching movies? Writing, cooking, etc. Everything that makes you feel happy. 

Also try to remove negative things. For example don't watch documentaries about depression but instead watch comedies. Stop reading news papers about war, suffering and other bad stuff in the world. But instead read positive stories. 

What also helped for me was saying affirmations out loud while I was walking down the street. People looked at me funny but I didn't care 😊. It is still a work in progress but iit already helped me a great deal."
bigdickproblems,f8721d8,t3_dz480n,1574313363.0,"I say turn it around or use it to your advantage. 

For the guy. Say Something that his girlfriend/Sister/Mother/his crush or someone like that is saying the same thing about your dig. That making fun of will soon turn into jealousy or respect. 

About the girls. That giggling tells me they are actually interested. So maybe ask them out or something."

I am happy she told me so that I knew I was getting in to. Funny thing is that after telling me she really started persuing me."
