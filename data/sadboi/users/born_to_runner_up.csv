As people have said here, everything was about the profile. I loved finding people who lived on my floor or were in my classes and discovering what books, TV shows, movies, or activities they were into. It was simple, but still so fun and time-consuming. Also remember, there was a time when the only picture you had was your profile picture, so it was a big deal when you or someone uploaded a new one. I distinctly remember a friend telling me how MySpace was *so* much better because you could have, like, eight photos on your page instead of just one. Lol."
