Regardless, I said “alleged” for a reason, and my main issue in this scenario is with the schools gross mishandling of the situation.

rant,foeuihr,t1_foeu3er,1587715206.0,"No. Fuck you. I’m not in the financial situation to do something like that. Charity is what you do when you have enough to give. If I didn’t have bills to pay, multiple copays to make for god knows how many fucking doctor appointments and if I HAD A JOB RIGHT NOW... sure, I’d give them away because I’d have more than what I needed for myself. I’m hardly making enough for myself. I shouldn’t have to continue wallowing in misery and laying in bed at night with tears running down my face because I don’t know how I’m going to pay for my car. Fuck you."
rant,foes6ey,t1_foerxg2,1587712929.0,"That’s so fucked up. I don’t see people doing that with N95s, but I see people doing that with those shitty, thin black masks. It makes me so livid. Mine are $10 each, but they’re each made one by one, with really good fabric, have 2 layers of protection and I spend all night making them. Hoarding N95s so nobody can get then and then selling them for $50!? That’s fucking evil."
AMA,fodi9qs,t1_fodgtp4,1587685024.0,"Mainly for me when I was a child. She felt awful for exposing me to her abusive boyfriend (we lived with him for a year), and wanted me to live a happy life. I’d known stepdad since I was 3, I adored him and he absolutely adored me. Also, for financial reasons. You could definitely argue that’s selfish, but my step dad only married her so that he could show his family that he had the most attractive spouse of all of his siblings."
AMA,fodfxmj,t1_foddm0f,1587684196.0,"Nothing, really. My mom didn’t really want to do anything with him anyways and doesn’t really like him as a person (quite frankly he’s a really bad husband). It doesn’t really change how I feel about him, it kind of just makes for funny jokes between me and my mom about how our life is turning into a soap opera haha."
