mentalhealth,fpuxcp6,t3_gfn5of,1588927045.0,"I don't have much advice other than try investing yourself in new things, treat yourself nicely and try getting into therapy or talking to someone you trust. I'm not a professional, just a 15 year old with a keyboard but here's how these things help me:

When I learn about new things, I become completely obsessed with whatever my focus is on. Sometimes it obstructs aspects of my life but ultimately, without that curiosity and devotion to one thing I don't know where I'd be. Some interesting ones recently for me have been the history of North Korea and Animal Crossing.

In regards to treating yourself nicely, it's basically just cutting out bad habits like procrastinating and staying up late and being more relaxed on yourself if you don't accomplish something the way you want to. We're all human at the end of the day but society pressures us to operate like perfect machines, when that's not realistic. Give yourself a cup of coffee in the morning, take regular breaks and eat enough to sustain yourself.

The last ones seem scary, and they are - but I often find myself thankful for doing at least one of the following: going to counselling, talking to a friend or writing in a journal/diary thing. Documenting your days and thoughts can offer some retrospective down the road. It's also a great feeling to see how far you've come in a year or two.

Sorry for this wall of text, I'm not sure if it's helpful or just some silly blabber I've spewed out. If you really think you're going to do something to yourself then please talk to someone, it sounds cliche but there really is so much to live for. Think of all the music you haven't heard and all the beautiful places you've yet to explore. There's so much more to life then people let on. Somewhere in this universe there's a place of calm waiting for you; It's on Earth, not on the other side. Please take care of yourself friend."

There's always something to do and you get to decide what it is. The satisfaction from seeing your island progress over time is amazing, and it makes me not want to time travel so that I can keep seeing it naturally grow."

Fair enough that you have to go out of your way to do it, but it's not cheating if the developers put no consequence in place. I also dont count the turnips as a punishment by developers for 'cheating' because the turnips are time based, so maybe because of the way turnips work they go bad if you rewind time.

Breath_of_the_Wild,fmc1f1c,t3_ftr641,1585937099.0,I get the feeling it's gonna be an Oot & MM kind of thing. Both games will be brilliant but one will cater to the people looking more for story and the other catering for those in search of a nice Hyrule field to ride their horses around and kill Guardians on. The second one might be more linear and have a darker colour palette (as we saw in the teaser trailer) but hopefully it won't lose that original Botw magic we know and love. I'm sure they'll find a fine balance for what they want this game to be.
