**The Great Alone, by Kristin Hannah**

After losing another job, Vietnam Vet and former POW Ernt Allbright moves his wife and daughter to a remote village on the northern Alaska Coast, on land left to him by a fellow POW who died in captivity. Hannah's descriptions of the wild beauty of Alaska were masterful. She also did an terrific job tracing the arc of Ernt's developing mental breakdown and the resulting domestic violence. Her exploration on what it means to be a family and a community also rang true.  My only complaint is that the teen romance between his daughter and the son of a rival was a bit too melodramatic and YA-ish for me. Overall, however, I enjoyed this book and Hannah's writing.

The main sources for infection are home, workplace, public transport, social gatherings, and restaurants. This accounts for 90% of all transmission events. In contrast, outbreaks spread from shopping appear to be responsible for a small percentage of traced infections. ([Ref](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058v1.full.pdf))

 *No person owning or keeping any animal in the Town of xyz shall permit the animal to go at large to the injury or nuisance of others. In addition, a dog should not go outside the boundaries of the property of its owner or keeper unless under the complete and effective control of said owner or keeper by means of a leash or otherwise.*

**The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, by Stuart Turton** 

Turton deftly handles a plot device that, in lesser hands could have felt clumsy or forced: the narrator has 8 days to solve a murder mystery, in different bodies. If he fails to do so after the eighth day, he's forced to repeat the cycle, possibly forever. Instead, Turton paints characters we care about, and builds suspense as our narrator unravels the mystery, and discovers the rules of the game he's trapped in, and those he shares it with.

He takes his wife and daughter to start a new life. I'm about 1/4 through, where the family is setting up their home and meeting their neighbors during one of the brief respites from winter.

AskComputerScience,fq63gzz,t3_gh144i,1589123712.0,"By far, the single most important reason for the average user to upgrade their OS on an existing computer is that the vendor will stop releasing bug fixes and security patches for the old operating system. If you do not upgrade, you leave your computer vulnerable to attack. Further, companies that write software for that platform will stop releasing new versions for the old operating system, making your computer even more vulnerable. 

Most of the new features in a new OS are added to support hardware innovations like new processor architectures, graphics architectures, etc. New pc's will often have hardware for which driver software was only written and tested on the newest OS. Your old PC doesn't have these new hardware features, as it was built for the latest available OS of its time. Sometimes there are strong technical reasons for only supporting the newest OS with new hardware, but most often it's because testing is time consuming and expensive. Supporting fewer platforms will save a lot of money. 

Now, every once in a while an OS release includes dramatic improvements. For example, Windows 3.1 to Windows 95 was a big deal: pre-emptive multitasking and plug-and=play, plus other things.  Most of the time, though, it takes a lot of effort for marketers to come up with compelling reasons for people to upgrade.

Remember the point of social distancing is to reasonably reduce the probability of transmission, not to make it impossible. The biggest problem, as I understand it, is that everyone wants to go on the same popular trails, so social distancing is very difficult at chokepoints, like trailheads and summits. I live in MA, and the last time I was up there was a winter hike in the Carters in March, before the shit started going down. 19 mile brook trailhead was its normally crowded self, and from what I've heard, it got far worse before the wmnf restrictions went into effect. Some places are issuing reservations to limit parking and crowding. That would be nice. The problem, of course, is the wmnf traiheads are mostly unstaffed.

My outdoor activities since then have been local trail running and cycling. I run on obscure local trails where I encounter only a few dog walkers who live in abutting neighborhoods, and I live in an area with so many quiet country roads that cycling is similarly isolated.

It is unfair to everyone behind him. Professionals do this for a living. They're not just running the race to set a PR, or for personal pride. Carrying someone across the line can take prize money away from a person completing the race under his own power. At the very least, it moves everyone else back on place, and pro contracts often have incentives for placing.

Race officials have to use their judgement about whether a crawling competitor should be taken off the course. In this case, it didn't appear that the crawler was in any medical danger, and he could have eventually made it across. I suspect that's why officials let him keep trying.
