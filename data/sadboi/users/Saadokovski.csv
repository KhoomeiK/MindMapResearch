I wish from the bottom of my heart that all your problems can be solved."
depression,fi3fvil,t3_f5nbbz,1582116708.0,"I think having depression is not a binary thing, you can have it at different scales, you don't need to feel miserable all the time to say you are depressed. I think your inactivity contributes to that but it doesn't mean it is the only reason. Take it easy guys, just sleeping and waking up at a same reasonable time everyday is a big challenge to guys like us."

I wish you live in peace, that is all I can say."
dating_advice,f1cqmmq,t1_f1axwll,1569363442.0,"I want to get a date but I don't want to feel like I'm forcing things, I don't know how to get a date without being a try hard, because whenever I try to get a little bit along with girl to ask her out I feel like I have an agenda! Because I can't just ask directly!! So maybe it s just I don't know how to approach girls and flirt with them, but I still don't think it s the reason"
dating_advice,f0t7a7y,t1_f0plqya,1568917150.0,"Well  I like Joe Regon, and I think he made a good point, charisma is a very important aspect.

But what can I say, I have very high self-esteem, and also in the last couple of years I started feeling like I don't have interest in talking to girls or even a new person, if someone try to get to know me I welcome him, but I don't go around  trying to make meet new girls, that s not because I'm shy, but it s because I don't feel like it s worth the effort, unless is talking to new girls is as beneficial and easy as drinking water.

I hope this makes sense, English is my third language btw"
