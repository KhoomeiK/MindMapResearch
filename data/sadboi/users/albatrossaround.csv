I can't say much for her being comfortable alone for I have been alone for nearly a decade before meeting my person. I have generally preferred to be alone as I'm a bit of a recluse. The only thing that has kept me alive thus far is counseling, and most importantly, DBT therapy. Borderlines NEED DBT. The whole population could benefit from it, but it would definitely improve the quality of her life. I would suggest DBT. There's a PDF download on the r/BPD community that was posted a day or so ago. I hope things can work out for both of you."

Arms length friendships, no fp and DBT have been the best way for me to manage symptoms. Though I do have a fp right now, I'm not doing so great. For me it's torture to either have or not have a fp. I found it best to keep myself completely busy with work, school, hobbies and exercise when I DON'T have a fp. Trying to figure out if I can make this work with my fp, right now. I'm currently screwing it up, big time... I was told upon my diagnosis that relationships will never work, and that I'll be alone forever. 

We quiet borderlines can be quite successful at everything in life, except for what matters most - love. This is just my experience. I can't say for anyone else."

Currently coming up on 4 months in a new relationship - first one since 2011, first one since receiving my diagnosis, first time sober (2012). 

I've never met someone I enjoy this much, though I've pushed them away several times, already damaging this relationship. The last time I pushed them away was almost the last time... I've made things so difficult, but I still have this wonderful person loving me some how. I fear, on a daily basis, that I will lose them as soon as I'm not afraid anymore. So to answer your question, no for the most part. Unless we work immensely hard at not doing what we always do when it comes to relationships.

I don't want to lose this one. I have to do things differently, and be ok with the fact that no matter who I date, there is a potential for them to leave, whether my illness strongly displays or not.
