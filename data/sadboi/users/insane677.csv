People have posted ""VS relife"" Static videos on this subreddit. That's fine, but when VSI does it it's wrong? (And these ""videos of static"" put out by VS have been overseen by medical professionals. And the unfortunate fact that some people have worsened shows that their is atleast SOME effect that can be studied further.)

I'm sure King's College in London does fine work, but they've yet to reach the auidience that VSI has.

I'm sorry about my outburst earlier, and I'm not insinuating that VSI is Christ's second coming or anything like that. But this anti-VSI mentallity is more harmful than good. Reach out to them and ask them to do better instead of just shutting them out."

""They promote mindfullness and meditation."" As coping mechanisims, yes. But not as a cure. At most they've said that it can relive symptoms, which isn't a strech at all since we all know that stress makes the symptoms of VS worse.

""VIP isn't working for me."" VIP is a first generation product for a rare, poorly understood condition. Of course it's not going to be perfect. 

A: They plan to update once they have more data.

B: Good or bad, it's effects seem to be temporary.

C: It hasn't even finished it's 21day trial yet, so we don't even know if it's an overall net negative.

D: It's free! Literrally the only thing you're wasting is time! It's not like the Tinnitus community, where you get fucked over with bullshit TRT treatment for thousands of dollars.

""They ask for donations."" Do you expect them to do all this shit out of pocket? Do you expect Sierra Domb to just open up her purse for every expense?!

They're founded by a VS sufferer, they've had celebirty promotion, they fund studies in multiple countries, they have numerous, knowledgeable neurologists and neuro-optomaglists working for them, they're active on social media, and they make it very clear that VS is awful, hellish conditon.

My interpretation of that scene with the advertisment is that it's meant to show how human Joi was becoming by contrasting her with what was advertised. Their's some similarities (""Good Joe."") But, like Roy and K, she became human by making her own choices. 

K's demanor in that scene, when he looks down at the gun, isn't dissapointment at the realization that Joi was an unthinking product, but rather rage at her demise.
