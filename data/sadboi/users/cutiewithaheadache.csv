AmItheAsshole,esen3i0,t1_esem4zm,1561904201.0,Your daughter literally PICKED A FIGHT and then she victimized herself by reminding everyone of your fiancé’s health when she knew she had gotten your son worked up. She’s manipulative. You raised a manipulative person. But I guess you’re too focused on them being on the dean’s list. Do you not see that?
AmItheAsshole,esemnr3,t1_esehu3f,1561903844.0,"I agree, ESH and you honestly sound like you set a poor example for your kids in terms of communication. Your partner is abusive for yelling at your kid to shut up and you’re an adult over here losing your temper and seeking validation for it. There is no excuse for being abusive towards your children and you should be ashamed."
StopSelfHarm,esdyn4y,t1_esdxojy,1561873512.0,"That really sucks and I sympathize with you. I can’t afford therapy either right now. I know you said that you didn’t want to start any new goals but I hope you’re gentle with yourself. 

I don’t know if I’m allowed to link in this sub but I listen to this mediation every night: http://74.62.111.169/kaiser/download/download_panicAttacks.asp. It’s a free kaiser mediation that my old therapist told me to listen to when things got really shitty. Especially the affirmations, they help a lot with quieting the depression voice/urge to cut if you listen every night while you’re in bed. 

Even if you’re just a little bit more kind with yourself every day, that’s a success."

StopSelfHarm,eraupcb,t3_c14i24,1560653379.0,"You’re going to be really anxious and have urges for about 2 weeks. It’s going to suck and you’ll realize how much you rely on it to cope. But after those 2 weeks, you don’t get such a strong urge anymore. Sometimes, I touch the area that I used to pick and cut and I press hard on it to stop the urge, but I no longer hurt myself.

It is difficult, but once your brain stops telling you that you NEED to cut to feel better, the habit is gone. If you know someone close to you that you trust, tell them that you’re trying to go sober. I told my boyfriend and we celebrated every day. It’s been 3 months now. So bottom line, you can definitely do it!"

Interstitialcystitis,ep202y4,t1_ep1yj9t,1558999618.0,I do! But we’re not sure which one affects me more.. right now my urologist thinks it’s primarily IC but maybe not! I did drink water while I was in the car because it’s just an automatic thing when I start having pain. However if it was the water that would be extremely fast. It’s definitely strange.. I think your idea about muscle tension might be spot on!
