It also depends on how well you speak or communicate what you’re trying to say. Some native speakers just mumble, and they expect to be understood immediately. 
Spanish is my mother language and it has 5 vowels (a,e,i,o,u) they are always pronounced the same. English language has the same 5 main vowels, but with different variations, that means you have like 15 vowels sounds, that makes it even harder to understand, even for native speakers."

AskReddit,fmrji3b,t3_fwp7ub,1586325108.0,"There’s a place where people go to drink alcohol next to my house (not a bar, not a liquor store). This weird place is next to a busy road. We always see weird things happening in that place, but that night was the worst. 
I arrived home late, I always have to walk a couple of minutes from the bus stop to my house. When I got off the bus I saw lot of people and the police, then I look down and I saw blood coming from the spot where the police were trying to keep people away. I saw the body of a woman, she was upside down (I couldn’t see her face but I’m sure she didn’t have one anymore). I kept walking wondering what just had happened, then I saw a big bus almost 80 meters away from the body of this woman. I realized she was ran over, but that it’s not the worst part. Apparently this woman was drinking in that place I mentioned before with her husband, they got into an argument and she just jumped in front of the bus. 
It was devastating when I saw her kids arriving to the scene and cry for her mom. People really do scary stupid shit when they’re drunk."

Things in Europe got really crazy and out of control, I’m not sure about the reasons and I would love to know why.

I’ve always had problems with my anxiety, but now in this specific moment I’m going really deep with this. I wonder why is this happening now that I have to be away from the person I love. He seems to be pretty relaxed about the situation and that bothers me (I wish it didn’t). I just have pessimistic thoughts in my mind, I have to share the room with my sister while I’m able to rent an apartment, so I can’t even show my family that I’m crying (I’m actually hiding under the blankets trying to breath). I’m worried about ever single thing. I’m concerned about my parents, because they’re definitely vulnerable. And being away from my boyfriend doesn’t help at all. My only motivation is to imagine this as a fight, not only against that stupid virus, but an encounter with all my demons. 
I wanna fight and I really wanna get better, and I feel even more encouraged after reading all your experiences. 
Also I’m struggling typing this, because English is not my first language.
