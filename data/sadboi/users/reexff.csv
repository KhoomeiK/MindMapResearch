But I will plug that I see this attitude of aggressively finger-pointing at modern pop acts like we're somehow better than them a lot. We're not. I think it's important to not turn into Neil DeGrasse Tyson needing to tell everyone their favorite sci-fi movie is BS. Or, for an example closer to home, people trying to insist that American Football isn't emo."

Or in a different sense - I tried listening to The Mountain Goats’ album *The Sunset Tree*. I knew what it was about, and was expecting a certain modicum of intense emotionality and unpacking trauma. When I got to the song “Broom People” - which is emotionally disarming, but for a very different reason - my literal first reaction was to think “Music this good should be illegal”, and I had to stop listening."
