AskReddit,fp8v3cg,t3_gbtdji,1588403999.0,"It was 2012 and the market had been sufficiently fucked for a long while and my parents (bio mum / whole life long step dad) were succumbing to a combination of my little brother dying five years prior (and never dealing with it properly) and having little to no money- dad was the bread winner and construction was seemingly non exisitent. They were definitely getting a divorce. I’m 22 and my girlfriend and I live with my folks- at this point it’s just my mum as pop has intermittently stayed over the last couple months. It’s not a pretty divorce (if there is such a thing, but this one is excessively ugly.)

One night I take my lady on a date and we have a little too much to drink so decide to go wait it off at a place that I used to play cards. At this point in life I’m a pretty broke kid so when I left with $450 more than I showed up with I was pretty happy. Enough time has passed and we head home. Get in bed and are calling it a night- probably 1130. I’m asleep for not long and my girlfriend wakes me and insists I look at this message my mom sent her. I believe she meant to wait to send it or misunderstood where we were, but it was definitely a “I’m killing myself take good care of everyone” text. I kind of shake awake and get my bearings and decide that “Yep. Okay I’d better fix this.” 

I head to her room and she isn’t in bed, but her bathroom light is on. I knock really hard and fast and am like “Heyyyy ma?” And I hear a pill bottle rattle a little bit and she says “Not now please.”

I didn’t care for this answer and told her to open the door. When she didn’t answer I kicked the door open- it really does that thing like in movies where the knob side trim piece falls off. There I see my mother in the bath just in her underwear and empty beer cans evvvvverywhere, an empty pill bottle, and a bunch of smoked cigarettes- mom has always smoked, but never (NEVER) in the house. She was gonna be on her way out so oh well I guess. 

I yard her up out of the tub and she is not super coherent, but very combative. I stick a couple fingers down her throat and induce a vomit. I mostly failed and it was just bloody. 

I had the gf call 911 and kept mom awake until they got there, but in my life I’ve never let anything keep me from staying calm so I kind of put all of this together and realize that now, since she isn’t going to be dead, she will still have to go through divorce process. Now though, she’ll be doing it as an unstable person. I love my mama and I won’t let her go through that. I tell the gf to tell 911 no sirens. I get her phone find out she messaged waaayyy to many people, but most of them won’t have any effect negatively going forward (she pre-typed them and then was sending them.)

It seemed the only ones I needed to circumvent were my little sister who was sleeping two doors down- easy and of course, my step dad who is awol. 

Deal with sister’s phone, police and ambulance arrive. I insist on their quietness and they were very thoughtful in this regard. They place a Police Officer Hold on mom and take her to the hospital. Sister never wakes. I have gf toss the house of anything mom can use to hurt herself in case she gets back before I do. There are a couple (maybe just one) people I can call on my step-dads side of the family that likes my mom more than him. So I just call until they wake up, shoot straight with them, and just ask if they know where I can find him. They do, but it ain’t close and it ain’t private. 

I live in a state that is perhaps an hour south of another state and he is two hours deep in the northern state (sorry for the odd explanation I’m trying to keep this unfindable) and it’s already coming up on 1am. Whatever. He’s at a resort that his family would go to every December. I hop in the car and spend the next hour and half doing about 100. I don’t have too much of a plan, but I did just win a little pile of money so we’re just gonna see what we can do. 

I’m about two miles from destination when I blow by a cop on a country road. “Fuck.” Pressed the gas harder. There it is, my left turn after 100 miles in a curtain of darkness. Red and blue lights up my rear view mirror. 

I pull over and decide to be polite. This is as close as I remember the exchange:

Me: Rolls down window
👮: I’m such and such, do you know how fast you were going?
Me: I wasn’t really interested, sir
👮: Wasn’t interested?
Me: I’ve had a really weird day, sir. 
👮: Do you get pulled over often? Hands on the wheel, keep saying sir, calm voice?
Me: No. Here is the deal...
I lay the whole story on him. No spared detail. Admit I don’t know how I’m going to find my step dad or what I’ll do when I do. Just that I need to delete his text before he sees it. 
👮: Okay, u/Gotted, resort is right up there. Drive safe on your way home. 

I hit up the front desk and tell them I need the room number to (Tep Dad Name) they obviously don’t want to give it to me, because that would be too easy. Some people that make minimum wage are a sucker when it comes to $100, but everyone that makes minimum wage is a sucker when it comes to $200. He on the second floor in room something (it was eight years ago I don’t remember.)

I start knocking. Nothing. Louder- it’s late -nothing. Pounding- an answer. “Who are you?” A stranger asks (a man) “Who are you?” I say “I’m looking for (name)” I finish. 

He tells me he is there, but I can come in. I make a fist and feel like I’m definitely headed to jail. Then cooler heads prevail. I make it VERY clear that i’d be seeing step-dad and that he needed to decide how it would go down. 

He turns on the lights and says “Hey, (name) someone is here to see you.”

Wiping his eyes from sleep he looks at me super confused (I don’t blame him there- even I don’t know how life could get this strange.) I see his phone on the nightstand and make a quick grab for it. He beats me to it somehow like he expects me to go for it. I can tell he hasn’t seen what is on it yet, because he starts to read with a strange look. 

I tell him I’m here because I need his phone. I tell him that I need to delete something and he can’t know what or why. He is resistant and we about go to blows, but I reason with him. Some bullshit like “Look you’ve been my dad my whole life and I get you are leaving. Whatever. Just do me this last fucking favor and open your phone.”

I assume he wants to go back to bed and relents. I delete the suicide message. Damn, mom. 

I head home. Call my boss on the way and tell him I can’t come in (it’s in like two hours at this point.) he’s pissed and I’m too tired to deal with his yelling at me.
