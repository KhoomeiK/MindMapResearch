mentalhealth,fluyrjl,t3_fr91du,1585512821.0,I also do this too! I put up a big post knowing that no one will comment but still getting upset and lonely when no one tries. I'm always here if you need anyone to chat to. I know how hard things are right now.
relationship_advice,fls1gk3,t3_fqjmwb,1585432338.0,"It's ridiculous that she won't even support your decision. I'm on the vulnerable list and have just recently been in hospital. My partner and I do live together and we made the decision that both of us would stay completely isolated as much as possible. My partners Mother is also vulnerable so we made the decision to stay away from her too. I just got through and operation and haven't seen any of my family since before I went in to hospital. We've been isolating for two over weeks now only leaving less than once a week for essentials. If it wasn't for my partner I don't know how I would get through all of this because I have poor mental health and seeing my family gets me through. However, with my partners support I feel we can get through this. My advice is if your partner can't support your decisions you may need to re-evaluate whether or not you want them in your life."
mentalhealth,flozyae,t3_fq47nx,1585348900.0,That is so kind. I'm struggling quite a lot. My mental health relies on me being able to see my family and go out and about every day. Normally I'm never in the house for a full day so I am finding this particularly hard. I have already been self isolating for 14 days and I have at least another 3 weeks. I am also here for anyone wanting to talk! We're all in this together! ❤️

sex,fjdmcyy,t3_fcsk12,1583255296.0,"My boyfriend's parents were always of the opinion that they'd rather we were safe in their house than out doing it somewhere unsafe. They knew that we were going to do what we wanted anyway. They knew that even though we were 17 we were responsible. I think as much as any parent doesn't want their child having sex, it's not really their choice and if you feel ready there's not much they can do about it. My parents had the same opinion and didn't let me and my partner sleep in the same bed. My sister ended up getting pregnant at 16 anyway so their approach clearly didn't work."
offmychest,fh8vw26,t1_fh6s9n6,1581368447.0,Thank you so much for your comment. You actually made a bad day a little less bad. Most people don't understand so thank you.
AskReddit,fh8vpxp,t1_fh6z9q0,1581368346.0,No I'm not an unreasonable person I do understand where the costs are coming from. Maybe that was the way I worded my comment I just mean that I would avoid it where possible. I generally don't like to carry cash anyway. I would always rather pay by card.
AskReddit,fh8vg1g,t1_fh733dq,1581368183.0,It sounds stupid because it's not like it's a huge amount of money only a pound of two per transaction. And I do understand where they get their costs from but I just will avoid it where possible.
AskReddit,fh8v4qv,t1_fh7i581,1581368002.0,That's true that's one way to look at it! It's not that I refuse to pay the money it's just that if I can pay by card instead I'd rather do that!
offmychest,fh5kamh,t1_fh55mwd,1581289813.0,I would doubt it. Everyone in my family are highly selfish. Even if she did pay for the wedding the thought of going to the wedding is enough to give me panic attacks daily
AskReddit,fh52a5v,t3_f1avnb,1581284382.0,I refuse to take money out of an ATM that charges me. I think it's ridiculous that they charge you to take your own money out of your bank account. It might sound stupid because it's only like 99p they charge but I still think it's unfair.
AskReddit,fh50flg,t3_f15nbj,1581283871.0,"As a woman who was sexually abused for a long time as a young teenager, I would never say things like ""it can't happen to men"". My mum didn't believe me when I tried to tell her so if anyone ever came to me and tried to talk to me I would be there for them. Life can be so damn hard sometimes and my past is something I will carry with me for the rest of my life. So if anyone needs so talk, male or female, they can message me!"

offmychest,ewsku0h,t1_ewsizqp,1565729612.0,I think there's a lot of unnecessary embarrassment associated with getting tested for STDs. Maybe if it wasn't made out to be such a big deal then people would get tested sooner.
offmychest,ews0kzf,t1_ewri075,1565717739.0,Thank you so much but it did take me 7 years.
offmychest,ewqtv0h,t1_ewqay9p,1565678869.0,They said it's possible it could still be herpes but it's the other results that im happy about. I was always too afraid to get tested because of what happened to me and I finally went last week and got the results yesterday. I understand that wasn't very clear in my post.
offmychest,ewqtqku,t1_ewplt7j,1565678708.0,Thank you so much
offmychest,ewqt68n,t1_ewqsbsd,1565677979.0,I was told by my GP that they didn't do the testing for HIV and I found out last week that they actually do they just chose not to. No wonder I was so scared to get tested.
offmychest,ewqt4k8,t1_ewqnxhb,1565677918.0,No that's fine. I know there's still a chance that I still have herpes and I'm okay with that. All of the rest of the tests came back clean and that's what I'm happy about. I was always too afraid to get tested because of what happened to me.
offmychest,ew80irs,t1_ew5iepl,1565200877.0,Thank you so much. If you can find someone you trust and feel able to tell them I would recommend it. I feel so relieved after telling my Dad. It took my mum and dad to split up before I could tell my Dad because I told my mum once and she didn't believe me. I do understand how hard it is though.
offmychest,ew57bh8,t1_ew55664,1565129353.0,Thank you I really appreciate that! It was a very weird feeling. I was so nervous I felt sick and I still am. I'm worried he'll tell other people or go to the person that done it but I still feel relieved. I hope you're doing well too. You should be proud of yourself too.
AskReddit,ew4i35z,t1_ew4hxua,1565111094.0,Yeah I get that. Chocolate is my worst enemy. I ended up buying a treadmill which is helping a little. But the weight is still hard to lose. No problem. If you have any other questions feel free to message me.
AskReddit,ew4hefz,t1_ew4gqku,1565110675.0,"It was actually a mixture of both. It slowed down my metabolism which done most of the damage. I had a few bad days where I would have eaten bad foods but nowhere near enough for the amount of weight I put on. I've been off the antidepressants for 2 months now and I've only lost half a stone. The weight is so hard to lose. Weight gain is a risk with most antidepressants but there are some where it is a bigger risk than others. When I first found out that the antidepressant I was on caused weight gain everyone kept saying ""it'll be fine you can lose the weight after"" but most people don't understand what weight gain alone can do to your mental health."
AskReddit,ew4dx36,t1_ew41x60,1565108550.0,I started counselling and antidepressants in January. The first antidepressant I tried was Setraline which kept me awake during the night. I couldn't sleep no matter what I done. The next one I tried was called Mirtazapine which made me put on 2 stone but it did improve my mood and it helped me sleep. However I decided to stop all antidepressants because the weight I had put on was putting me down so I'm still trying to battle my mental health medication free. But I would never put anyone else off trying it. There are so many different kinds and it genuinely works for some people. Good luck and I hope you find the solution for yourself.

medical,evh0y62,t3_cjvuip,1564518853.0,I'm not a doctor but it's unlikely that an STI would take 3 months to show symptoms. Usually if you get an STI it would show itself within a month.
offmychest,euxdzs7,t1_euxau63,1564086448.0,Yeah I was referred by my GP and was working with a mental health nurse for a few months then she referred me for CBT. It just makes me wonder if all psychologists are like that because if they are I'd rather have panic attacks and PTSD for the rest of my life.
offmychest,euxaet4,t1_eux9rmw,1564085219.0,"I went home and told my mum what happened and she said ""well just don't go back"" which was not helpful at all.

medical,etl6vzi,t3_cc8hd9,1562924683.0,I'm no doctor but my partner when for blood tests on his liver. They showed up irregular for about 3 months so they sent him for a scan. It turned out he has fatty liver. Nothing serious just needed to stop eating as much fatty food. The reason I'm telling you this is because even something as simple as that is enough to put the tests off.
mentalhealth,etiyp2e,t1_etisy4q,1562862701.0,I'm the opposite of you. I see my family every day. My mum still thinks it's not true. I have a problem where I can't say no to her. I do everything she asks. I can't say no to her.

mentalhealth,esnon22,t1_esn3k12,1562141949.0,No point in using something to try and fix a mental health problem but ending up causing a whole separate one in the process. You have to remember that it's always your decision whether or not you stop your antidepressants. My doctor has always been very supportive in that way. He never wanted me to go on Mirtazapine but it was my therapist that wanted me to go on it. I wish I never did.
mentalhealth,esmcwo3,t1_esmawao,1562102822.0,I completely understand how you feel. I started on Mirtazapine 3 months ago and I've gained 2 stone. I decided to go off it a week ago. Hoping the weight drops off me. It definitely made me more depressed
mentalhealth,esix8m8,t3_c81bn2,1562021969.0,"That sounds like an awful experience. All I can say is, don't give up. Depression seems like a losing battle but it's never worth giving up. I am on the same boat as you. I've been on countless medications which never worked for me only made me put on 2 stone! Could you maybe try to self refer yourself for counseling? Also maybe try and change certain things in your life. The little things make all the difference. When I found things hard I started to exercise more, go out for walks and I started baking (which didn't help me weight problems) . I found that if you take things one problem at a time, things seem more achievable. Never give up."

One small hit and I'm worse than I ever was
mentalhealth,esikrmx,t1_esijtgk,1562015443.0,Sometimes it's just hard because if my own mother doesn't believe me then surely no one else will.

That's another month away and I don't know if I can wait that long
mentalhealth,esik9nu,t3_c7tk21,1562015193.0,Sometimes it's not about what we eat. It's about how we view ourselves. So what if we've put on a bit of weight? If I'm having a bad day and a bit of chocolate might lift my mood for 10 minutes then I'm gonna do it. Because sometimes it feels like every day is a battle. I've been on Mirtazapine and it made me put on 2 stone. I've felt like crap ever since. Last week I made the decision to come off it. Even though I haven't lost I view that as a little victory. If put of 14 days you have one day where you binge eat. Focus on the fact you done great for 13 days. That's what matters
