PepTalksWithPops,fqia9es,t3_gj114a,1589393206.0,"hey cousin. i know what you’re going through. it sucks. it’s not fair to be left so lost, coming out of a family like ours. i think i’m younger than you, but i can try to help. 

remember that you don’t need anyone else’s permission to do something anymore. it’s hard to shake that feeling that everything you like isn’t good enough, when you’ve been taught that. but the good thing about being an adult now, is that you can un-teach yourself. you don’t need anyone’s OK but your own. and you don’t need a reason. 

remind yourself that you are young, and just a human. and you deserve to be free. you deserve to do what you want, when you want to, for the sole reason that it even MIGHT make you happy. you get to decide that for yourself. no one else. 

if you think, “i want to pick up this hobby”. for every excuse that your brain comes up with to quit, come up with an equal but positive reason to continue. you won’t believe yourself at first. but every time you ignore that pessimistic voice it gets easier.

exercise free will. practice doing things for no reason other than I WANT TO. get confident making those choices with no one else’s input. 

remember that nothing is as bad as it seems. spent $100 that wasn’t ABSOLUTELY necessary? so what. you’ll get $100 more. move on. did bad at something? who cares. you’ll do better next time and it’s good enough that you tried at all. move on. 

you don’t need anyone’s approval but your own. and that’s great. you know why? you can give your own approval freely. gone are the days where it’s necessary to justify your existence and come up with reasons to go unpunished. just let yourself exist. 

let the soft animal of your body love what it loves. play when you need to play. rest when you need to rest. spend a little money on something nice for yourself. those ARE productive activities. they’re producing a healthy and manageable life for you. stress-relief and rest are more necessary to survival than work. put them first. 

you only have yourself to answer to. and you can always choose to respond with love and forgiveness. 

stay strong fam"

 nightmare. you’re one of the good ones. 

don’t use glutinous flour in a shared kitchen with a celiac. at all. also don’t use or keep gluten items on shared shelves or counters. keep knives, cutting boards, sponges, cooking tools, completely separate.

Codependency,fqi6mfp,t3_giz381,1589391262.0,"i hear exactly where you’re coming from. i went through something similar, and just left my last relationship in february. after recognizing my codependency, and feeling that initial grief, ive never felt better. 

it’s kind of a bummer, but also really important to hammer in your head that you WILL be incapable of finding someone who will love you and respect you the way you deserve if you do not love and respect yourself first. 

we tend to settle for relationships that don’t make us happy. because we think it’s better than being alone. or we think that it’s normal to want to be in a relationship, to have another person bring you your happiness. it’s not healthy. you have to be the source of your own happiness. only then can you have the confidence and knowledge to reject the love that is not meant for you. 

every day alone gets easier. pick up some new hobbies, or restart the ones you lost when you lost yourself in someone else. reconnect with friends. watch TV. if you feel lonely, reach out. if you feel scared, distract yourself. 

it will be ok. and it will be worth it."

Parenting,fq3p3c2,t1_fq2aoqg,1589068622.0,"i hope it’s ok to piggyback off of this

reading your story, it’s shocking similar to mine. except i was the child, and i was only 2 or 3. my mom kidnapped me. was in and out of jail. talked badly to me about my father. and then eventually fled the state to get away from a warrant. she told me she was coming back. she lied. 

i figured it out really fast. again, i was about 3. i wish my parents would have been honest with me. i didn’t even have a good relationship with my mom. i hated her, actually. i was happy to not be forced to see her anymore. and still, it would have been so much easier on me had someone talked to me about it. 

i didn’t know the details, but i knew what was going on. my mom was crazy. and then she ran away. and she wasn’t coming back. i could grasp all that. what i couldn’t handle, was the silence from my other parents back home. the secrecy. i never trusted them and i still don’t. i have all kinds of issues now (although i’m better than i’ve ever been!), between two alcoholic parents and a family line of mental illness and a whole lot else. 

six is plenty old to understand. your son is already very smart. i already understood when i was being patronized at six. explain to him. let him talk to you. validate his feelings. don’t leave him in the dark. make sure he knows that he can trust you, and that you two are a team. it’s very crucial right now."

And I can’t believe even now, I’m thinking of what would give her closure!! Thank you for asking me what would help ME. I needed that. 

I think drawing a line will help me move on. I think I hesitated to write a message because I was afraid of her reaction. Like I don’t want to see her upset... I really do care for her. But it’s not about her, and it’s not like she’d be less upset somehow if I don’t say goodbye and she just finds out later. 

But, I think it would definitely help me to write a short parting message. I want to ghost, but it’s not my style. I’m really honest and communicative. Which is another part of why this whole situation blows so much. I’m also working on my boundaries a lot this year. This will be good practice."

GERD,fo9y6sy,t3_g56s67,1587634731.0,"i’m an avid cannabis consumer. and yes, smoking does weaken the LES / exacerbates GERD. switching to edibles would help. it’s not the THC or the CBD that harms, just the smoke as far as i’m aware. although i wouldn’t be surprised if CBD relaxed your stomach a little. 

i smoke small amounts and generally right before i eat. i would stop or switch methods but cannabis is the only thing i’ve found that stimulates my appetite in a timely manner, especially in the morning when GERD symptoms are at their worst. i figure i’m already in horrible pain, it’s worth it to make my reflux worse for a couple minutes in exchange for getting rid of my nausea and then being able to eat. and once i’ve eaten i don’t have reflux provided it’s not a trigger food. 

i’m not sure to what extent the long term damage is on the LES when it comes to smoking. so i’m not sure if what effects there are are reversible. i’ve always had silent reflux, and then the worse parts of GERD came so gradually it’s difficult to pinpoint them or their potential relation to my cannabis use. so i’m not much help there. 

hope this helps"

this is the normal way to react. a lot of people don’t like condoms. whether that’s the average for a guy (or girl, or whoever) or not, it’s the minimum expectation that you work with your partner and their needs to compromise.

it seems like he goes straight to eye-for-an-eye, withdrawing his willingness to use condoms as punishment for her not wanting BC. and it’s bad enough to use that tactic ANYWHERE, but it makes it so much worse that the thing he is effectively threatening to punish her for is ... bodily autonomy."

LifeAfterNarcissism,fo99fpz,t3_g6ba95,1587613662.0,"i think you’re completely right and well-trained by your narc to doubt yourself. 

living through the abuse means becoming intimately familiar with all the signs. and if you’re post-abuse it likely means you recognized them for what they were and used that recognition to get out. our brains pick up patterns and use that to keep us safe. 

where other people who haven’t been through this see “problem behavior” we see it for what it is, narcissistic abuse, because we’ve learned that. and it’s a lot easier for us to spot than other people. 

we’re not making up problems because we’ve had them before. it’s the opposite— we can see the problems clearly for what they are because we’ve experienced that. 

while i think it is a symptom of trauma to think about abuse a lot, that doesn’t mean you’re gonna see it where it doesn’t exist. that’s the gaslighting talking. you’re in the right here."
RBNSpouses,fo7x2we,t3_g5rxtl,1587586030.0,"oh :-( 

the things you’ve listed are already abuse. 

his screaming, his constant snappishness, and you feeling like you need to walk on eggshells are all signs of emotional abuse.  

and punching things around you, as well as driving recklessly with you in the car— that is ALREADY physical abuse. it’s not limited to just hitting you. 

he has trauma. but that is not a valid reason to be abusive to you. and trauma on its own does not make a person abusive. they are in control. 

think of how many people grew up with narcissistic or neglectful or abusive parents and DON’T grow into abusers. abuse is not a symptom of trauma. 

you’ve only been together for a year? you’re so young. and it’s so early in the relationship to be dealing with this already. you don’t need to stay with him. don’t fall in love with potential.

detrans,fo5b0fm,t3_g5mk3r,1587521410.0,"it’s hard to know. another person said this too, but it’s more helpful to think “what do i want” rather than “what am i”. 

i’m AFAB nonbinary, currently on testosterone. i’m exploring this subreddit because a lot of butch lesbians (which i am) end up going on T and de-transitioning. i keep reading their posts and wondering if i’m “really trans” or if it’s like some people say, that i’m just uncomfortable with being a “gender-nonconforming woman” or the male gaze to the point of needing to hide from it. 

ultimately that’s not the case for me. i’m not a man. but the idea of being a woman is revolting to me, regardless of what the people around me think of women. i hate my chest. not because of the way people treat me for having it. i just hate it. i don’t want to be seen as a woman. not just because women are treated like shit. but because i’m not a woman. i don’t have any insecurities about being masculine. and even if women were respected more than men (haha) i still wouldn’t want to be one. i know that intrinsically. i’m simply non-binary and i’ve always felt this way. 

i was worried about regretting transitioning before i started, but i wanted to and i felt like i owed it to myself. i haven’t regretted it for a day. i’ve never been happier. because i’m trans.

AmItheAsshole,fmf8k90,t3_fum1tm,1586022091.0,"ESH. you because of your attitude and your friend because of his hypocrisy. i personally don’t think it’s immoral to cheat one semester’s grade. you sound like you probably have ADHD. i have ADHD and had the exact same schooling as you, pretty much perfect except one semester i bombed my sophomore year because i hadn’t developed study habits (my ADHD kept me afloat in school). i would have given anything for the opportunity to cheat. all my other scores blew literally everyone out of the water. except my gpa, sophomore year. my scores were well beyond good enough to qualify me for harvard. except one fucking semester. so you’re in the right there, honestly. it’s ridiculous to think your whole future should be fucked because you didn’t know how to study for a four month period when you were FIFTEEN. the whole comment section is bootlicking."

nonbinarylesbians,flcovtk,t1_flckxwn,1585039988.0,"i second this ^

i also am a nonbinary butch lesbian, who got out of a year long relationship with a man, was diagnosed with PTSD and decided i could never be with a man again. it’s funny and heartwarming in a weird way how many of us there are. i found a home with r/butchlesbians for sure

addon: i experience a LOT of dysphoria and it has been, and still is incredibly confusing as far as identity goes. i’m 2+ months on testosterone, and more sure about the butch lesbian label every day. just do what makes you happy, there’s no rush."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fla3rv5,t3_flezpt,1584975990.0,"honestly. this happened to me. AND. i DID post about it. on all my social media. not as a smear campaign..... but just to let everybody know what happened. and to let everybody know that if they were close with my ex, they could not be my friend. 

everyone will tell you to not engage. but it’s up to YOU what you want to do. it’s up to YOU what will make you feel healthy and loved and heard. for me, it was coming clean to everyone about all of it. 

there was backlash. i had “well-meaning” people (friends of the abuser) come to my DMs to call me toxic and abusive. (PS telling the truth about abuse is NOT ABUSE.) i had people i didn’t even know come into the comments and call me a liar. 

but. it let me know exactly who to block, and EXACTLY all of the many people who are really my friends. a lot of people believed me, stuck up for me. blocked my abuser when they hadn’t before. 

for me, it was totally worth it. i gained so much closure and i’ve felt so much safer since i did that.

it put an end to the stalking. it put an end to the surveillance. it put an end to having people i couldn’t trust on the borders of my friend groups. and it gave me long-needed relief from the constant persecution that is an abuser who smears you to everyone they know. finally, i could tell my own story. finally someone could hear that it wasn’t me.  

your healing is up to you. do what you need to do."

butchlesbians,fj1laej,t3_fakw3h,1582922437.0,"i’m on T through planned parenthood. my parents don’t know. no medical professional is legally allowed to tell anyone your medical info if you don’t give them permission to disclose it. if you talk to planned parenthood / the pharmacy about discretion they should be able to help you. 

without insurance, my appointment would have been about $100. i think closer to $90. and my insurance doesn’t cover my T, but it’s still only $10 a month for the hormones. and like less than $10 for the rest of it (needles, syringes, sharps disposal). that’s if you’re ok with injections. other routes of administration will be significantly more expensive without insurance."
latebloomerlesbians,fiwql83,t3_f9iu9p,1582798311.0,"hi. if i may be of any help. 

my situation sounds SO much like this. 

i dated this man for a year. he was so good. perfect. so nice to me, and we got along great, and we grew together. and i was happy with him. 

but i read the doc about a week ago. and i started bawling. because it confirmed suspicions i had had for years. i was afraid to lose him. but i couldn’t deny that the post explained exactly how i felt. 

we broke up yesterday. i’m sad, but i feel incredible. we had a good relationship while we were together. that’s what matters to me. we’re staying friends going into the future. i miss him. but it’s time to be true to myself. 

i hope you find answers, friend."
