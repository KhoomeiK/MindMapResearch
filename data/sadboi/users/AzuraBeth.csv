I finally asked them this year and it was just my imagination but still really convincing.
ptsd,fojf8ap,t1_fojf23o,1587819192.0,Safe environment first. Hands down. There are other coping mechanisms that could help you (they're all over Google) but it's up to you. Just so long as it doesn't cause more harm than good.
ptsd,fojeby0,t1_foj5jts,1587818409.0,"I'm a psych student and one thing that's really fascinating about PTSD and trauma is how you change biologically so you get more hypervigilant and easily startled etc. As the other comment said, be careful with relying on dissociation. I went through years of traumatic life events almost totally fine as I kind of dismissed them which is a form of dissociation that I can't remember the name of (I would say repression but compartmentalizing also fits). But when I was triggered (which was a kind gesture from a friend but brought back those memories) I had a complete breakdown and when I opened myself back to the world, I got triggered again so now my mental health is shit and I have years worth of trauma to work through. 

Don't let my story discourage you though. Dissociation is the minds best defence to trauma but it's like a dam holding back the memories of the past. Just ensure you're in a safe environment with a good support system for you and you'll be ok. I never thought I could get the support I needed but I met my two best friends by chance and they're the reason I'm still here. I hope you have a good enough support system but, for the time being, rely on your mind to protect you‚ù§Ô∏è

ptsd,foj2kw7,t3_g7q9dw,1587805851.0,"Dissociation is actually one of the minds resources to help people with trauma, so yes it can be seen as an ally. In my opinion, it only becomes an issue when it's negatively impacting your life. As an example, when I worked as a carer I helped a man who had many severe health problems that smoked non stop but the doctors actually told him to not stop smoking as the stress and biology of it would harm or kill him. So it's a sort of lesser of two evils, but is actually your mind protecting you from harm."

pagan,fngwrhi,t1_fngw5f1,1586947829.0,"The fun thing about the placebo effect is that it can still happen even though you know it's a placebo. So you can think critically about things and the effects remain in place. I do a lot of divination magic and am also very cynical about things so even though my brain is telling me that it's not real, there's enough belief to carry it through. 

Also I'm sorry I didn't answer your question, I just kinda went on a rantüòÇ For me, deities are someone we believe can help us with any problems we have when we don't know how to achieve something and then by putting the strain on someone else we can think more clearly about the problem and how to solve it. For instance, when asking a deity about if you should take a job opportunity away from where you currently live, you already have a subconscious idea on what you want to do but then you can blame the deity when you carry it out (like it was a sign). In Wicca you don't necessarily need a deity and in my practice, the deities aren't better than us people, they just have access to knowledge we don't. I like having a deity as it provides a safety blanket for me knowing that I can ask for help and guidance when I feel lost. But Wicca is more personal to you and your beliefs so the deities are very flexible.

Edit: I should also mention that Wicca is typically pantheistic so all deities are different versions of the same deity which is why you'll find different wiccans with different gods/ goddesses as their deity."
pagan,fngvq57,t3_g1hmzh,1586946750.0,"Tbh I always look at religion from the point of view of psychology. Spellcraft and prayer function in a similar way (although spellcraft is a bit better as it's more involved) as when you ask someone you believe to be of a higher power and able to help you achieve your goals, you're more receptive to small details in life that can help your goals. Derren brown demonstrated this in a show about a town and it's magical dog statue which goes into further depth. So for instance, you do a love spell, you're now psychologically primed to be a bit more confident and can pick up on signals you may have otherwise missed. There was a study done (sadly I can't recall the name of the study) where sick people were divided into three groups; one without any prayer, one where the person was told they were being prayed for, and one where they were being prayed for but not told. The only one to have significant improvements in recovery were the ones being told they were prayed for. There are also so many studies showing the benefits of religion and how it can produce a placebo like effect. 

I was raised Christian but something never felt right to me. So when I reached the breaking point I thought about how I believe the world works and is a religion necessary in my daily life. Later on I found out about Wicca and I didn't have to change my beliefs to fit in. I should also mention that the concept of the afterlife is purely personal as your own experiences can alter how you perceive existence and you should believe what makes you want to live your life to the fullest, even if that means you don't believe in one. I, for example, choose to believe in reincarnation as it sort of makes logical sense to me. We have the energy that keeps us alive and energy cannot be created or destroyed so when we die that energy will either go to a new person or its as simple as our bodies returning to the earth around us. 

For me, paganism is about choice. Wicca isn't really set in stone unlike other religions so it's about being the best version of yourself and doing your best to help others. So what I would advise is to think about yourself and how you perceive the world. Then you may find the right religion for you or you may not need to be religious to live a happy life, which is great either way üòä"

BeautyGuruChatter,fm9zxzu,t3_ftw74c,1585880446.0,"I love drag race and trinity but I think she just went way too far. Twitter isn't the best platform for shady jokes as it can easily be misinterpreted. So James is a tiny bit at fault for joking on twitter. However, trinity was on a whole other level. It's one thing to throw shade back at someone, it's also ok to not like someone and speak your mind, but to belittle and lie about someone who hasn't done anything to you except irritate you is on a whole different level. While James is an adult, trinity is more than 10 years older than him and it's just extremely immature. Also the fact that James was a fan of trinity just adds to the fuckery. Like it isn't hard to ignore and not respond to someone. 

I don't like James but I do feel genuinely bad for him as he's grown up in the spotlight so all the dumb shit everyone does as a kid was just scandal after scandal. After the Tati thing I've changed my way of viewing drama to be honest. While it's still entertaining sometimes and something to be aware of other times, I don't take it too seriously anymore. When Tati uploaded her video I was all in the drama, watching every video made about it and ignoring James's side of the story until a few videos said that James was actually not at fault. I watched his video and felt so bad for him that this 38 year old woman, who was like his mother, was trying to ruin his career over vitamins. 

I now despise cancel culture after basically growing up with it as people are not villains in reality. Some people genuinely deserve to be ""cancelled"" in the public eye after either repeated actions or allegations that have a legal basis (like assault where there is evidence but the victim may not want to take legal action). However, people can learn from their mistakes despite still having consequences for their actions. I'm honestly shocked about how James is coping with his mental health as everything he's been through could be devastating and he's still just doing his own thing."

I desperately want someone to love me for me but anytime I think about getting close to someone I have a panic attack due to my past and abusive ex. It's awful and has been a lifelong problem for me and it sucks when I see my friends getting out of a long term relationship (2 and 4 years) and instantly getting back into one with amazing and attractive guys.

mentalhealth,fj6cbwk,t3_fbtehk,1583066969.0,As a pagan myself and a psych student specialising in mental illness my distinction between if it's a religious thing or a disorder is how it impacts your wellbeing. If it negatively impacts your day to day life then it's a problem but if you are aware it is part of your religious beliefs then that's a valid thing. Moreso during meditation if you have an experience with a god then it's not hallucinatory as 1) you're in a different state of being to be more perceptive and 2) you're either consciously or subconsciously seeking that information out which is the opposite of psychotic disorders where you have no control. In dreams you can't necessarily control what happens so it's 100% not abnormal. If you have further questions please feel free to ask!

Society advances quite quickly as you can see from the start of the decade to now in regard to the LGBT community. Trauma is a subjective thing and our attitudes towards it can affect the development of trauma related disorders. I've been through a lot of traumatic events that'd cause PTSD on their own but some don't really bother me because of my attitude towards it so yeah it's actually one of the more scientifically interesting aspects of this hellish disorder!"

mentalhealth,fgsfjmh,t3_f0601y,1581082941.0,"When my depression first started I was 15. I've been told not to cry and that I'm selfish (idk why I'm actually pretty selfless imo) and it's my fault. I still have problems with it today. Like if my PTSD is triggered by my parents all I can say is just it's not my fault. I've learned to not go to my parents when looking for sympathy. I'm living with my best friends who are like my sisters and will always be there for me 24/7 just like I'm there for them. I also have a regular counselling session which helps. My parents did evolve over the 7 years I've had mental issues, mostly because my sister had even worse mental problems. My mum is still a brick wall so I've learned to go to others I trust will be sympathetic. Only problem is that I don't tell my mum about my mental health so she got a shock at Christmas when I was a mess. I didn't even tell her about my assault until 3 years after and even then it was more of an implied answer as I usually do when I don't want to lie but don't want to tell. Things will improve but with a brick wall for a parent it's hard to get better so I found a better alternative. I really hope things get better for you though‚ù§Ô∏è"
entitledparents,fgphbuq,t3_ezqsve,1581004801.0,God I'm sorry that happened to you. Doing my exams literally broke me and I still struggle even though it's been 5 years. Luckily my university is amazing for accommodating my mental and physical health and they've done everything they can to reduce the impact exams have on me. I'm also proud you managed to continue on after that ordeal. My brain just shuts down when I'm triggered and it's a huge pain. Luckily you'll be done with normal school and university will be so much better for you if you plan to go that route. Apprenticeships and vocational courses are good too but are a lot of hard work as I did two before uni (quit hairdressing and got a beauty therapy degree).
exchristian,fgpgc0g,t3_ezpnqv,1581004245.0,This is why I loved the ending so much! It actually made me think of the concepts of heaven and hell in a way I hadn't before. I don't believe in the Christian heaven but a few pagan religions have a similar structure to what the good place did. I like how it is kind of logical too. Like you get your reward for being a good person and then move on and rejoin the universe. I love the good place and the finale made me cry so much but a sort of happy cry.

exchristian,fgn26uv,t1_fgn1y76,1580936268.0,I had to teach my dad how to do it. And then whenever I'm home from uni he asks me to fix the issues he has. I'm cool with it as he buys me the tech I need for uni but tech and coding can be so annoying sometimes.
exchristian,fglifpf,t1_fgkz6rg,1580899394.0,I think this is what makes me so damn angry over the church I went to. Like no one really has a care for other people and just want to judge others while not giving a shit about other people's struggles. Like when my friend had a mother dying of cancer was asked to pray over a sore ankle or when my sister's church friends didn't take 10 seconds to write a card for her when she was hospitalised. It's fucked.

TheGoodPlace,fgf9dxs,t3_exydmw,1580731059.0,"I'll be honest, as a person who is suicidal right now I was concerned about the door when it was introduced but the context of the final episode ensured that I knew what they meant. I love how the good place combines aspects of many religions and discussed the flaws and benefits that come with that. I can totally agree with what you said about suicide though. A few days ago I was the most suicidal I've ever been and felt disconnected from reality. Sadly I've also seen the other side of suicide and remembering how I felt when someone who is close to me kept trying to die stops me from acting on it. I now view suicide as an explosion. It's violent and spreads the pain you feel onto everyone who loves you. It sucks feeling this way but I know I can get better."
ptsd,fgbaczm,t3_exlwka,1580660029.0,"Trauma comes in all different forms and all are valid. You came close to death which is traumatic so you have every right to have PTSD. The way I see my PTSD is having big traumas and little traumas. There are some things that pop up frequently and fuck me up and then there are smaller things that'll make me feel a bit worse. For me, one of the smaller traumas is my suicide attempt. It's small as it wasn't life threatening but once in a while it'll come up and I'll relive it down to the exact feelings that came along with it. I cannot imagine the emotions you must've felt when it happened to you. I'm happy you're still here even though you're still struggling. I'm here for you if you want to chat."

chronicfatigue,fgb1g0q,t3_exjhj1,1580657570.0,So I'm not sure if this will help as my main issue is fibromyalgia but moving the TV and console next to your bed is really good for days when you can't get out of bed. I'm going through a really bad depressive spell and really wanted to play on my ps4 but I couldn't even though my desk is literally next to my bed. So I moved my ps4 and monitor so I could see it from lying down and I'm finally able to play. Also I don't think it works for the PS2 but you can use remote play on a ps vita to play console games on a handheld device. Remote play is also available on other devices like pc and Android (I think) but you need good specs so it runs smoothly üòä

No matter what it always gets a response of ""it's not a religion, it's a way of life"". Like yes, that's true of all religions.

I was pretty young when my grandpa had one but I remember my dad. He was dreading the possibility that he'd have to go into surgery and wake up with one, which did end up happening. He's not very vocal about his feelings but he definitely had a few self esteem issues because of this and if we had more people showing their medical devices (not just colostomy/ ileostomy bags) people would feel less self conscious over things they can't control. He's cancer free now but has bad scars on his stomach which we joke about as it's sort of in the shape of a cross and he's a very Christian man."

mentalhealth,feykak8,t1_feyjr0z,1579446651.0,"Yeah, I was taught that when I first started doing it. It never really worked for me as it's more about the entire process of cutting.

So using ice or snapping yourself with an elastic band is for the pain element and drawing in red for the blood etc. It's a good idea in theory but not always applicable sadly.
