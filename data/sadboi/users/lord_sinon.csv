orbusvr,fma3sqs,t3_ftun8x,1585883109.0,I have similar qualms with this game but what really irks me is the runemage as someone who got the game solely for the magic cause it seemed cool to have the limit being how fast you can cast but the fact that the recognition is so shit that people can use bullshit scribbles to cast higher level spells well drawing it the proper way doesn’t even work half the time and I did sink a lot of time into the game before reborn and post and even got fairly good with casting spells at the cost of wrist pain but I’m still annoyed at the shitty detection . To add a bit more I was hoping in reborn they would add in a bit more spells for runemage that could change the fighting mechanic instead of everyone spamming curse than an ice and fire ball over and over they would adapt the system for more of a type system where if you knew your enemy and their weakness you would be rewarded as well as being rewarded for knowing more spells specific to an enemy type.

To this day he keeps up the same antics and whenever you see him talk to anyone you can see them dying inside where they just reply with yeah or uhuh. What you should do is just tell people be bluntly honest it’s imo the only way people could start to regain respect for you and just try to break the cycle."
