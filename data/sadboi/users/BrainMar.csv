relationship_advice,exczv23,t1_epjr3tn,1566163736.0,UPDATE: My ex and I are back together after much discussion about our relationship and where we'd like to see it going. We even both discussed our thoughts with good friends outside of the relationship who would be able to give us unbiased perspectives. AND IT HAS BEEN GREAT! I am so happy to be able to be with him again. Our only tough spot currently is with my parents who hate him (and don't know we are back together yet) but it's very clear that we've changed as people so a lot of our problems we had before are lessened or non-existent. Thanks for your help/support during my hard times! :)
relationship_advice,eu41ysh,t1_eu3w8vm,1563434454.0,Eh we have our feelings for each other that's a bit where our relationship gets complicated but we've agreed to stay just friends and trust each other so neither one of us is gonna start anything back up again.
relationship_advice,eu3pxcj,t3_cen75y,1563421629.0,"I'm interested to hear responses on this too! I'm the girl who's friends with her ex....like really close friends. We share pretty much everything with each other and talk every day including good morning and good night texts most of the time. Neither of us is in a relationship and I don't know if we'd really scale back how much we talk to each other because we've agreed to a ""bros before hos"" kind of mentality where unless our we are super serious about our SO, the friendship comes first and we will do anything to keep our friendship. That being said...it is totally platonic and he's almost like a brother to me. It sounds to me like maybe your BF and his ex have something similar except maybe not as close as my ex/best friend and I? For example my ex/best friend is planning on staying almost a week at my house for a mini vacation just the two of us...and it doesn't sound like your guy is nearly that close to his ex. Either way definitely talk to him about it, it sounds like he's a reasonable guy and would be willing to find a good compromise."
relationship_advice,esq88ud,t1_esq7lju,1562197441.0,Agreed...my ex and I are amiable after our long term relationship ended and we still talk everyday but getting back together is just not an option based on the reasons we broke up (and some stubbornness on both ends).
relationship_advice,esgfv1l,t3_c7ng4p,1561951864.0,I (22F) am best friends with my ex (22M) and we still have feelings for each other so seeing each other date is a little hard. But we are always best friends first so ultimately we just want each other to be happy. I would say these two in the OP could be friends as long as they aren't hurting each other in excess (or at all). It seems like it is very hurtful to each other to be friends so I'd say talk it out!
relationship_advice,es1iude,t3_c5fg1m,1561497819.0,"Do what you want! I didn't have my first boyfriend until I was 20 even when all my friends had been dating since middle school (so like 13ish). I enjoy the single life personally and I don't ever really look for relationships but when it happens it happens. Either way, you do what you want. :)"
relationship_advice,erwntny,t1_erwnruo,1561349490.0,"Thank you for all your advice, it's definitely helpful to hear someone else's point of view on this!"
relationship_advice,erwnawk,t1_erwn3gl,1561348981.0,"Yea I have feelings for him and he's admitted that he still has feelings for me. He deals with it differently and ignores/denies it but still takes every opportunity to compliment me, calling me smart, freaking adorable, hottie, awesome person, etc etc... I do the opposite. I admit I have feelings for him but because he's uncomfortable with it and we agreed to be just friends, I never really mention it and don't really ever gushingly compliment him anymore."
relationship_advice,erwmgop,t1_erwmapb,1561348184.0,That's why I'm hesitant... We were good friends for almost six months before dating so I know he's a good guy. I just don't know why he's being so weird but if I tell him he's different he just says it's because he's happy or that he's more social. I know my point of view is distorted due to my mental health issues for sure as well.
relationship_advice,erwlfhp,t3_c4hnx4,1561347234.0,I think that would be a good idea to write a letter. It allows you to take your time and think about what you're saying so you don't unintentionally hurt your ex even and it allows you to make sure you're getting to say everything you want to. And then when you finish writing it you can still decide if you want to send it or not. When my ex and I broke up I wrote him tons of letters...that I never ended up sharing even though we are on speaking terms.
relationship_advice,erwl8ay,t1_erwky9f,1561347054.0,"Thanks! And that's the weird part...he has all these new friends since we've broken up and he even was telling me about a girl he has a crush on (that he can't do anything about because she's not single). But he claims he's happiest he's been in a long time but when I point out that the biggest difference is that he cut me out of his life pretty much, he changes his tone to say that he was happier with me but he's as happy as he can be now. I told him not to spare my feelings but ugh its so messy and complicated and I totally would just cut him off if I didn't just click with him like I don't with any of my other friends (even other friends I'm close to don't even compare)."
relationship_advice,eqh6tll,t3_byg0f4,1560050485.0,"Whatever you do I'd try and tell him your thoughts in person so it's easier to read reactions and emotions. Don't be accusatory instead try ""I"" language....""I feel this way"". And BE NICE! he spilled his guts so say something like ""this is really sweet and I enjoyed ""specific part"", but I feel ""blank"""""
relationship_advice,eq9mwfg,t1_eq9mr3f,1559912302.0,Guess there's always more than one way to peel an orange...or whatever the saying is. Either way I myself have a low self esteem and low confidence so I relate to the OP...but everyone's situation is different.
relationship_advice,eq9mjlu,t1_eq9m7b5,1559911983.0,"I feel like that's a harsh way of putting it....but yes he is definitely hurting. My ex took maybe a week after our relationship ended and then started going out with friends almost every night and ~seemed~ much more happy than when we were together....only much later when he and I talked about it did he admit that he was crushed for more than a month and surrounded himself with friends to distract his aching heart.

Maybe he's A) distracting himself and B) hiding his hurt from you for whatever reason?"
depression,eppxmda,t3_buf2jg,1559394529.0,I've rediscovered some motivation. I know things aren't magically better and I'm not suddenly cured but I feel better. I have things to look forward to in life that I am passionate about.
relationship_advice,epjsqa2,t1_epjr3tn,1559259587.0,"You know... I'm not sure. Our friendship has always leaned more towards the ""more than friends but not dating"" category, even before we actually dated. We've always been very close so now I don't feel guilty that I'm joke flirting when there's another woman. 

As far as getting back together...that's still a ways away if possible at all. On that front the only for sure is that I'm not going to pressure him or be pushy about it, especially now that he's in a #foreveralone kind of mood."
relationship_advice,epjf438,t1_ep5n8ek,1559253002.0,So the info he had on his crush being single was false....he thought she'd recently broke up with her current bf but apparently they are still very much together. My ex is pretty bummed that he can't ask out this girl now (he's a good guy and wouldn't dream of going after somebody taken) but I feel low key relieved.

relationship_advice,eperyk5,t3_buo7nm,1559186325.0,"From a girl's perspective... Try and find some common ground. Mention a popular movie (most people will have seen or at least heard of the latest Marvel movie), compliment her clothes, ask what her favorite song is. Most of us are nice enough that even if it's awkward we will respond...also confidence is key! Good luck!"
relationship_advice,epc5fk0,t3_buh5bz,1559150392.0,"I am feeling the same way about my ex and the sad part is that he has admitted to missing me, still loving me, and having a desire to reunite. BUT, he won't take me back for a few reasons that I won't get into (reasons that I don't necessarily agree with). I don't have any advice but I want to say that I know what you're feeling and it sucks. Best of luck to you and your situation."
depression,epc44ch,t3_buh9d2,1559149970.0,I downloaded an app on my phone to learn a new language. It made me focus enough to think and it's formatted like a game to keep me entertained...yet I can also take breaks whenever I like or do lessons in 5 minute blocks.

depression,epb96aa,t3_buf0jp,1559139474.0,"Yes I've felt something similar. In my case I feel like I'm in a dream watching myself interact and smile and try to be normal with my friends and family but on the inside I just want to stay home by myself. 

I have 'good' days where I detach myself and live in a fantasy world of the future where everything is perfect but then my depression comes crashing back down. 

You are not alone my friend."
depression,epb8mbz,t3_buf3nl,1559139259.0,I'm sorry you've had to deal with this. I want you to know that you are not alone in this world even though it feels like you are. The worst part will be waiting for better times but they will come and you will heal and grow. You are strong.

relationship_advice,epaw1pj,t3_bude78,1559134272.0,Maybe he knows about your feelings for him and doesn't want to make you feel bad by being That Guy who always talks about his gf?
relationship_advice,epavjzt,t3_budnj3,1559134074.0,"I'm sorry for your situation, but yeah it sounds like you're a placeholder. If she really cared about you or your friendship she wouldn't be ditching you for every new guy she meets. Good luck!"
relationship_advice,ep8mrt4,t3_bu90gb,1559096997.0,"I'm curious to what advice you get...I am in situation where my family hates my ex but we are still great friends. I'm worried that if we ever tried to get back together that my parents would make it extremely difficult if not impossible. (they are a big reason we broke up in the first place) Right now I can't even tell them that I am talking to him as a friend because they'd be very upset.

When I was seeking advice on what to do for that, I was told to live my life regardless of parental opinions as long as I am happy and in a healthy relationship with my SO."
relationship_advice,ep62ign,t1_ep61d41,1559063831.0,"Yes absolutely...it's still on the table actually. At any time we know that if either of us feels it's best to cut off contact then we will. Also, immediately after our breakup we did take some time, it was only a few days but necessary."
relationship_advice,ep5x83b,t1_ep5w7q2,1559061969.0,"It is hard...it's hard every day. Communication is how we are able to stay friends, total honesty and openness. We tell each other when the other has crossed a boundary whether it be too flirty or too hurtful. We respect each other and know that there may be times when we need alone time or time apart. Most importantly we hold no grudges."
relationship_advice,ep5l0uf,t1_ep5ke3t,1559057466.0,Thanks and thanks for sharing your experience.
relationship_advice,ep5jtdj,t1_ep5jb3w,1559056983.0,Lots of communication is key I suppose...I don't know if I'd be as trusting or chill if I were in your position. I told my ex that he needs to be very clear with his new gf (or new possible gf since they haven't started dating yet) about what I am to him so that she has a fair warning.
relationship_advice,ep5iucl,t1_ep5ikgy,1559056586.0,Thanks :) I know he felt really awful about telling me about this other girl but I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason and it will work out for the best no matter if the result is what I want right now.
relationship_advice,ep5i4zz,t3_bu0cp7,1559056284.0,"When I read the first paragraph I did a double take... it's almost my same breakup situation. It's been almost 2 months apart and he still says he loves me and wants me back and I feel the same, but he won't because the situation which caused our breakup hasn't changed. I have not seen him at all since the last time we hung out as a couple and I really want to see him but I don't know how I'll react...I'm saving this post! Best of luck to you!"
relationship_advice,ep5hjm3,t3_bu0er4,1559056029.0,"I dated my best friend for almost two years and it was a truly wonderful time. In the end we didn't work out, but we care enough about each other and our friendship to keep in touch and maintain our friendship. My advice....he's the still your best friend. :) It will be awkward but that's what makes it fun, especially as you get to learn and grow with each other."
relationship_advice,ep5gyaf,t3_bu0g3p,1559055775.0,"This is interesting to me because I am the ex gf...my best friend (who is also my ex) is about to ask out another girl and I don't want to ruin any chances he may have with her because of how close we are. (He regularly tells me how attractive he still thinks I am and not a lot happens in each others lives, emotionally and otherwise, that we don't talk with the other about.) We truly enjoy our friendship and would not want to lose it for anything, but new SOs will make it difficult (as your post as pointed out)."
relationship_advice,ep5cjjz,t3_btzpnk,1559053742.0,"I too am guilty of that late night rant on my phone looking for advice lol. But from a girl's perspective...I'd say see how she responds to you. Does she seem to enjoy talking to you? Does she reply to texts pretty frequently or are you left on read? Most likely if she's taking time out to reply to you or even in person to hold conversations with you, she won't be opposed to giving you a chance. And if it turns out that she isn't into you like that, well the least you can say is that you tried.

Like acp\_rdit said....it makes for an amusing story later. (I have one of these stories myself)."

relationship_advice,ep3526s,t1_ep30gw7,1559017247.0,A word from experience though....it can be very hard when you and your ex still love each other and one starts getting into the dating scene again. The other will feel jealous but conflicted with wanted them to be happy since you care so much.
relationship_advice,ep33jdp,t3_btvb6j,1559016350.0,I'm not living with my ex but he's my best friend still even though our breakup was rough... It's weird though now that he's moving on and I haven't been able to. Lots of communication and honesty had helped us keep tension low.
relationship_advice,ep32gg2,t3_bto3nc,1559015960.0,"I'm the girl....sort of... When my bf broke up with me, we agreed to be friends, which was a bad idea so soon and I ended up with my mental health declining to the point of where I was suicidal. My ex is the one who called the cops for me. Now, we are friends again and enjoy our friendship tremendously. 

From my point of view, the best advice I can give you is to be there for her as much as you can without hurting yourself too badly. Don't give her hope that you can get back together unless you mean it and truly mean it. And best of luck, I know it's a very hard time."
