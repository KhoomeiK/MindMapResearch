I wanted to share them on here anyway, all I've done is take them from social platform to another, since they're amazing pictures and worth watching 
 I had no Idea they were posted here before 
Anyways no one mentioned the true artist yet which is ""JillGiovanni"""

I would suggest using*couchsurfing*"
TrueOffMyChest,f4jn438,t3_di57j1,1571622555.0,"I'm an Egyptian, I won't defend, 
There's a lot of truths written here, but it's heavily exaggerated; also as an Egyptian I've never liked Cairo. 

So It's like someone talking about the dark side of the moon, it exists, but it's not the complete truths

Aswan is a great place to visit, you won't find people who wants tips there, almost no garbage, and amazing sightseeing
Alexandria as well is a very pretty city

Hurghada, Sharm El Sheikh, Dahab, El Gouna, El Fayoum, Siwa 

Amazing places for tourism

But Luxor and Cairo, exactly as he described 

Maybe the only exception is the downtown in Cairo."
