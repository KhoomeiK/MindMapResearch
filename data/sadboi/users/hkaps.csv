todayilearned,fdm9swh,t1_fdkte9j,1578543399.0,"Great question! I work in disability services at a large university. My job is to work with students with disabilities to ensure they receive the accommodations they need. 

For Mason, communication aids and physical environment considerations are the obvious first thought, but he'd likely also be eligible for things like allowance of an aide or service animal in class, notetakers in his lectures (invaluable for students whose disability makes it difficult to write), alternative text formats (such as electronic texts if turning physical pages is a challenge), and extended time and/or readaloud on assessments. There are probably more that I'm not thinking of that are specific to his needs. 

If you're wondering, accommodations for students with disabilities are determined on a case-by-case basis by reviewing documentation and recommendations from the student's health care providers. While students are not entitled to any modification of the curriculum (i.e. making it easier or different from what other students are doing), they are entitled to reasonable accommodations that will enable them to access the material. The law that makes this possible is the same one that allows people with disabilities to receive reasonable accommodations in the workplace! This is a key difference between K-12 public school, which has other laws governing it and where students ARE entitled to modifications if appropriate, and college/workplace."
