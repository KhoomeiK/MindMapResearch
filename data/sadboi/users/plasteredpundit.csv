The doomers will hate to hear this, but when viruses mutate it does tend to be in the direction of lower lethality. It's hard to picture a virus as having hopes and dreams, but what it wants to do more than anything is spread, as far and wide as it can. They can't do that if they're killing their hosts too quickly.

And for the ""SpAnIsH fLu!"" crowd, the world was a VERY different place 100 years ago. WW1 had just ended, so conditions across the board for humanity were let's say...sub optimal. Coupled with the fact (and this is a big one IMO) that we didn't even know that the flu was caused by a virus, we were playing by a very different set of rules when it came to treating illnesses than we are able to now.

Get this alarmist shit out of here and back over to r/coronavirus.

If you're not going to post the relevant portions of the study then you're doing nothing other than fear mongering:

Excerpt 1:
In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures or
support treatments that generate aerosols are performed; i.e., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration
of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient
from the ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 


Excerpt 2:
A recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine has evaluated virus persistence of the COVID-19 virus.10 In this
experimental study, aerosols were generated using a three-jet Collison nebulizer and fed into a Goldberg drum under controlled
laboratory conditions. This is a high-powered machine that does not reflect normal human cough conditions. Further, the finding of
COVID-19 virus in aerosol particles up to 3 hours does not reflect a clinical setting in which aerosol-generating procedures are
performed—that is, this was an experimentally induced aerosol-generating procedure. 

Excerpt 3:
There are reports from settings where symptomatic COVID-19 patients have been admitted and in which no COVID-19 RNA was
detected in air samples.11-12 WHO is aware of other studies which have evaluated the presence of COVID-19 RNA in air samples,
but which are not yet published in peer-reviewed journals. It is important to note that the detection of RNA in environmental samples
based on PCR-based assays is not indicative of viable virus that could be transmissible. Further studies are needed to determine
whether it is possible to detect COVID-19 virus in air samples from patient rooms where no procedures or support treatments that
generate aerosols are ongoing. As evidence emerges, it is important to know whether viable virus is found and what role it may play
in transmission."
