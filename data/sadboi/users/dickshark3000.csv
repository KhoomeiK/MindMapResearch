This might be a stretch, but maybe he was jealous of her getting more attention from OP than he was, and it triggered some weird aggressive behavior. As stated above, OP was this guy’s only friend, so the thought of being replaced or pushed aside set something off in his brain?

Just a thought."

TrueFilm,fp0p1ak,t1_fp07dbd,1588213799.0,"See, I’m on the opposite end of the spectrum. I think the fact that I watched it at this really pivotal point in my life (early 20s), it made me feel less alone in these experiences. I think my struggles began when I got to college in my late teens I battled with addiction for a brief period and substance abuse. Watching this movie kinda made me step back and think “holy shit this needs to end”. 

Watching from an omniscient perspective, I felt for these characters just trying to find themselves like I am. (Although I will admit I wanted to jump through the screen and choke Telly) But the film seems to really evoke emotion about the coming of age trope more than any Ive ever seen. It left out the goofy humor like “oh these silly teens” and said “look at these children. They’re misguided, and more complicated than we think of them as”. 

I also really admire how timeless movies like these are. The teenage experience, even some 20 years later, is still the same growing pains."

But I don’t necessarily feel guilty, I’ve just kind of wondered why we’re conditioned to enjoy protagonist saves the day and gets the girl and isn’t HIV positive, but look down on movies that shine an unwavering light on the reality for some.

All I really gathered from this is that you have insecurities about stoicism, maturity, and vulnerability about yourself that you’re redirecting to your girlfriend, who seems to be a completely normal 19 year old. She actually seems to be someone who is genuinely on track to becoming super successful. I think expecting a 19 year old to have it all figured out and be an emotional brick wall to top it off is a ridiculously obtuse notion. What she is doing is showing you that she trusts you not to be judgmental in these moments, which is exactly what you’re doing which is unfair on her behalf. My first piece of advice is to not hold others to a standard that you yourself cannot even fulfill. My second piece of advice would truly be to break it off, and instead of immediately going out in search of this Wonder Woman you have embedded in your mind, I suggest you probably really look into yourself and figure out why you feel like you need someone so emotionally unphased. Is vulnerability scary to you? If so, why might you think that is? I really think that this is an issue that stems from you, and not your previous partners. You are the only common denominator."

If you need someone to just talk to, please feel free to talk to me! I can’t offer professional help, but I can offer someone to vent to. 

It sounds corny, but you are the only person on planet earth who can fuck up and fix things for yourself, and the world is your oyster. If you hate your job with a seething passion, try something else. There’s plenty of interesting entry level jobs to immerse yourself into. If you’re finding yourself dispassionate about life right now, take time to find things that genuinely pique your interest. Music, volunteer work, movies, chess club, whatever works for you. If you want to get back in the school scene at some point, take some time to get back to a place where you can shoulder it mentally, and take it at a snail’s pace.

However, address the thoughts logically. Remember, the cons outweighed the pros enough at one point. It’s easy for us to romanticize past events in our head. 

Writing these thoughts down too would be an excellent way to catalogue them, that way you can organize rather than letting it float around chaotically in your noggin.

It could be caused by a number of things- tight pants, poor ventilation, improper hygiene, or it could even be a medical issue like a yeast infection or BV. 

However, if you’re comfortable in the relationship, communication is key! Sex is weird and embarrassing sometimes. 

Coming from a woman, my advice would be to just be honest and lighthearted be like “Hey babe, I’ve noticed a bit of an odor going on down there and just wanted to let you know so that you’re aware”, but follow up by reminding her that you’re attracted to her etc so she doesn’t get super insecure.

The second thing I would do is seek therapy if you aren’t already, and just ask for any recommendations that dont involve medication. They’re specifically trained to offer you this sort of knowledge. Also, if I could make some of my own recommendations to you, mindful practices like taking inventory of your day, meditation, and generally just taking time to yourself is extremely helpful. 

As a side note, this might sound a little ridiculous, but have you considered maybe looking into trying CBD? It has none of the effects of ingesting actual marijuana, but in my experience has bettered my mood and relaxed me when I needed it.

Edit: Just based off reading about your experience with anti-depressants, can I ask if you’ve been continually prescribed SSRIs? I was misdiagnosed several times with MDD before my doctor realized that I was actually dealing with Bipolar 2. I had horrible experiences with every SSRI I was prescribed-if there was a negative symptom, I was getting it; an insane amount of weight gain, lethargy, just generally fuzzy in my head, and still sad. I was ready to just give up on taking any medication. Then after kind of researching psychiatric medication on my own, I asked my doctor if they’d be willing to let me try out an NDRI, and it saved my life- I lost all of the Lexapro weight, started feeling energized, and just significantly more motivated and happy.

Honestly if I was as down on my luck as you, I’d go live it up at the bar on my special day. Get some birthday shots in, and unload for the day. Also, maybe reschedule with friends? Nothing fancy, just a belated birthday dinner or bbq or something of that nature. If it makes you feel any better, my last birthday was ass too."
Advice,eu1ff2o,t3_cebpeh,1563366045.0,"You can find other methods besides the sleeping pill- some sleepcasts, breathing exercises, meditation.

Advice,eu1enk7,t3_ce9zq4,1563365694.0,"The best way to deal with this: communicate, communicate, communicate. Tell your mom that you’re thankful, but you don’t want to burden her with financial hardship- you’re worried. I think she’s upset because she thought you were throwing a tantrum over the pants, but let her know that wasn’t the case at all. Also, hug her."
Advice,eu1e75l,t3_ce8txv,1563365486.0,"So we’ve got two scenarios: She’s probably concerned about your wellbeing, or making sure you don’t blow the money before reaching your goal. 

Moms are paranoid- the Internet is a wildly dangerous place at times and I think she’s just trying to protect you for now. I know it might be ridiculously annoying, but 14 year old me did NOT need a computer. 

Just find a compromise- if you get the computer of your dreams mom can set some boundaries for you. Earn her trust, let her know you’re responsible."
Advice,eu1df8n,t3_cea36h,1563365130.0,"If I throw on a headspace sleepcast I knockout in 3 seconds. Cut out any visual stimulation and do a breathing method to calm your heart rate- 6 seconds in, hold 7 seconds, release for 8 seconds. Also drinking water about an hour before bed also tends to help. You’re naturally going to wake up if your body is screaming for H2O. I hope this helps."
Advice,eu1chfb,t3_ceb2qs,1563364693.0,"I think *hacking his email* would turn things into an absolute shitshow, so I’d avoid that honestly. If he responds to you asking what that was all about, maybe you can conjure up a copout answer like “So sorry, your profile popped up on my explore and I recognized you/ thought I recognized you and accidentally hit a link on your account” It might work. He’ll probably just be way more confused than freaked out so I wouldn’t sweat it."
askwomenadvice,eu1bhdk,t3_ce7t7j,1563364177.0,"You can absolutely support your friends without getting over involved. I had this same issue too; I’d pack on people’s problems so that I wouldn’t have to address my own. It’s definitely emotionally taxing. I’d just start by slowly removing yourself from the constant play-by-plays of their lives. Support them by doing things you both can enjoy. 

Of course leave rooms for heart to hearts, but don’t be afraid to express your feelings as well. Make sure your concerns don’t go unheard. You also shouldn’t be comparing your problems to theirs if they seem to be in worse situations- your feelings are valid as well.

If you aren’t feeling okay- if these people really care about you- they’d support you as well. You can distance yourself without seeming cold. You have to take care of you or you cannot possibly take care of others."

My advice is probably if you see them again you might have the chance to strike up some sort of conversation. If it’s meant to be it’s meant to be, yanno?"
