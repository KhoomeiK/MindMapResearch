From main menu go back to campaign, choose your save slot, select mission, (I chose hell on earth) - double check before starting mission all cheats are off (even turn them on them off again to be sure) - load in to the level - quit and resume your campaign. Boom. Slayer key should appear."

Good luck and keep us posted!"

Maybe you can use tomorrow to talk some sense in to people or this move by the county will actually force their hand? Either way - please be safe and take care!
