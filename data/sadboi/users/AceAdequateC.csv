Oh and his latest album is pretty good too, ~~but I don't think it's on YouTube yet though, so if you PM me I can send you a link to it~~ (scratch that, I found a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nstbaZq8oJA&list=PLwmFccMSiBz4dC_isInmk3FlhBUsf0v1t)).

I guess realizing that we always have a chance for that kind of independent self-betterment can really go a long way. Even if it doesn't always feel that way. But hey, it starts with one right?

It's amazing that you made amends too, it's a difficult thing to do, to accept the past and just move on for the future, especially when it's between multiple people."

aww,fqol8dn,t1_fqo43cv,1589517893.0,"Screw that though man. 

As much as I'd desperately want my Dad to be someone he isn't, I can't make that happen. He made his choices and he chose to do wrong by his family, what's done is done.

What you can do though, is focus on growing beyond it, and maybe even becoming a father like this guy in this clip and support your kid like you wish your father had supported you. Even if not that, you can just try and be a better person regardless.

Everyone always has a chance at that, self-betterment is not bound by age nor experience, but by the lengths you're willing to take yourself to.

I know how much having that hole in your life hurts, but you can't fixate on it. It just doesn't help things, you gotta' focus on the things in your life you still have a chance at."

Other people may not feel the same way and that's fine too, they don't have my same-exact values, and frankly that's a good thing. It's what allows us to make these choices for our own independence and senses of self.

I hate saying it so definitively, because it makes relapses all the more painful, but it just... I can't go back man, I mean I know I'm alone regardless of whether I look at it or not, but still, I can't do that. I can't keep hurting myself with all that. Because it does hurt to cross the line."
DunderMifflin,fqok2oi,t3_gju0g5,1589517080.0,"I feel like people are kinda' being too rushed in trying to bring life back to how it was and get out of this quarantine. 

I mean I get why, you all have lives you want to get back to, friends to hang out with, plans to get back on, it's scary seeing the world how it is now, isolated, a little barren and paranoid.

Even if, the government doesn't know, I don't blame them for that, if there's an issue in how relief efforts are treated, by all means people have a right to be angry at them for that, but knowing just when it'll be safe again isn't one of those things.

Just... Give yourself time, give the world time at that. Just... Let it breathe, I know it's hard, but we can't just half-ass this and have the best expectations of it going back to normal at the same time. 

It's tough, scary and isolated, and I get that people feel so so alone, I do too, I felt that way even before all this, but it's just something we have to let the world process.

Take a step back from the news, the media, all the constant noise

I'm still trying to cut that stuff out though, it's just the day counter was bugging me and I felt like I was being watched or given these expectations somehow. I'm 19 in two days too, so I'd really like to rid myself of that nonsense and go into the next year of my life clear-headed.

What I'm trying to say is if you want to get better, do NoFap, but you don't necessarily have to join r/NoFap to get better that way, unless you want some extra support, or feel you'll really benefit from it."

Doom,fqo3g0p,t1_fqnyjsk,1589506784.0,"Yep it really seems it'll definitely get more solid as they go on, I really feel like they almost perfected the gameplay this time around, so I guess it's just gonna' take a little while for them to decide on a decent mix between the old-school and the modern and more realistic in the next game.

Starting to test something out is always a little awkward, so now that they've done that, they can start to really flesh it out for good."
Doom,fqo0zix,t1_fqkyplu,1589505352.0,"Damn they'd sure have a reason to fear him after that. Not sure why you'd come to the conclusion that the Slayer killed him though honestly, he doesn't really kill people that don't pose a threat to him."

Doom,fqnxxbz,t1_fqmsl3v,1589503599.0,"Yeahh, I definitely miss the more realistic take 2016 had on the in-game world and environments. I think it works for better for what they were going for in Eternal to be a little more arcade-y, but I still miss it feeling more logical like it did in the previous game.

I guess they really were embracing a lot of Doom's roots this time around though, including the old-style weapon and health pickups. It works, even if it feels a little less grounded."

Don't get me wrong though, the gameplay is fantastic, they made it better than 2016 and as overwhelming as it can be juggling everything they give you to handle the demon hordes, it feels so amazing once you get the rhythm down for it.

That being said though, the story, Battlemode, a lot of it just ends up feeling a little empty, and that it could've been handled a whole lot better than it was."

It really does add a fair bit of atmosphere to the whole thing too.

Doom,fq3ldb8,t1_fq2vn51,1589067613.0,"Ah man, that kinda' sucks. I mean I do like the skins there a little better than the ones in the series, but that really feels like a little too much work for a moderately decent award."
Doom,fq3kpbv,t1_fq39pug,1589067440.0,"Definitely, I know it's a little out of nowhere, but it kinda' reminds me of what they did for the Plants vs. Zombies games, they made it increasingly goofy and you could really tell they didn't really care about what they were making the further they went on.

And that can be fine for some games, but sometimes it comes across as them having little faith in what they're making altogether. 

It'd be really awesome to see some really dedicated and detailed skins for Doom Eternal, and as much as it makes me chuckle slightly seeing the Archville using a phone, it really doesn't fit with the game.

Plus the reason the Unicorn skin kinda' works is because his mannerisms remain the same, so it's funny seeing this threatening guy dressed that way.

As long as it doesn't detract from the actual thing, it's fine to be a little goofy."

Doom,fpj8wap,t3_evjxvq,1588660170.0,"From what I searched up it's actually a guy named [Kyle Chapple](https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/video-games/Doom-Eternal/Betrayer/), there's no one credited as the Betrayer on [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8550890/fullcredits), but he is on there too, so I'd say it's pretty certain he is the guy behind it.

Oh and he has a YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdO-YiG6k6Wwyz5wJy83xzw)."

funny,fpcoks1,t3_ebzhdi,1588508061.0,Haha I gotta' check this movie out sometime I forgot the name but recognized it all the same. Really looks like some great stuff hahaha.
funny,fpco2dm,t1_flu3cgk,1588507583.0,"I actually kinda' want to try that out now haha, especially with the virus floating around now it might actually be helpful to sterilize it heh. 

Even though I now you'd need a little more than just some boiling water to clear it."

funny,fpchkuq,t1_fo7khwd,1588500951.0,"Honestly I'm interested already from that one clip of seeing Karl Urban's gruff Logan-esque demeanor. Looks pretty cool.

I'm sure it's at least cult-classic level already though, I've really heard nothing but good things, even if I haven't heard it from many people."

2meirl4meirl,fp1wjn4,t3_gaocvw,1588249771.0,"I don't know about you but the whole ""7-book epic fantasy series"" thing sounds kinda' cool.

At least a lot cooler than the latter stuff that I actually do experience. Man, I'd love to have any kind of inspiration or drive left over at this point. I feel like a husk."
breakingbad,fp0fqpv,t1_fp0683c,1588208385.0,"I don't know if he's asking for that exactly. It seems he's asking for those seeking recovery to just believe him in what he's saying and his methods, not to condone his past actions, but just so they can believe it enough to move on.

Honestly, I don't know what to really make of it personally though, I don't think I could live with myself if I ended up doing something as bad as what he did, but then again, if that's not the way you choose to 'solve it', you gotta' recover somehow."

breakingbad,fp03x7i,t1_foxl9ed,1588202017.0,"Eh, some people are complicated like that I guess.

Plus I guess a lot of methods of recovery kinda' do include ignoring the past in a way that makes them seem unsympathetic too much of the time."
