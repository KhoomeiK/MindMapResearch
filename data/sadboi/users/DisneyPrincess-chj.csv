I'm glad she dropped out of your wedding if you think she should be honoured to be your bridesmaid! 

You asked her to dye her hair, from her natural colour, you asked her to cut her hair because if its shorter all of a sudden it makes her hair blonde rather than ginger. 

For crying out loud, you have asked everyone to adhere to a dress code and colour scheme and you've hired security to stop anyone from coming in who hasn't stuck to your theme. A colour scheme is great, but your bridesmaids won't stand out if everyone looks like a peacock! 

You make brides look awful. Yeah the day is about you, but it's about your love and commitment to your damn husband! It's meant to be a day to spend with family and friends, not to alienate people. 

What will ruin your wedding photos is some of your friends and family (including your cousin) not being there because you have pushed them away. Well, that and your bright red devil horns. 

You seem to be very entitled and determined to get your own way at any cost. I got married last year, and apart from the shoes and the dresses, I didn't control my bridesmaids or my guests. They even changed into more informal clothing for the reception, I didn't throw a strop and cry because someone didn't match my colour scheme.

I wonder if it'll ever get easier, or if I'm stuck this way. I have to constantly remind myself that he does love me, and we got married for a reason. It sometimes puts a strain on the relationship but ultimately, he's pretty understanding."

You need to talk to him, sit him down, tell him how you feel, tell him you didn't enjoy it, and tell him you feel uncomfortable that you said no and asked him to stop and he didn't. Tell him that you may be willing to try it with plenty of lube and actual consent. 

Knowing me, I would not say anything, let it eat me up inside and then finally come out with it all crying. But that's a problem with my brain.
