Also try the week end Market, Chatuchak. That is a shopper's mecca. Most of the items are really cheap plus the clothes, omg. Fashionwise, they are up to date!! 

But what is a trip to thailand without trying the Floating Market? :)  We've tried Damnoed Saduak Floating Market. It's in Rachaburi and quite a few hours from Bangkok. It's something new and quirky. I have never experienced floating markets before and the idea is cute. I did it mostly for the experience because the stuff sellers sell are comparatively more expensive than the ones i can buy from Chatuchak!! Nevertheless, it was a tiring but fun experience!!

&#x200B;

For foods in BKK, please don't ever set your feet off of this beautiful city without trying the Authentic Pad Thai. Coconut Ice Cream and the Mango Sticky Rice.

Also, if you can, visit Jay Fai!! It's in Pra Nakhon area.  And try her famous khai jeaw poo!!!!! Her restaurant is micheline approved!!  (\*)

If you go to Siem Reap, please go to Angkor Wat!! Cambodia is relatively cheap. If you the luxury of time, i suggest you go to Pnom Penh and visit the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum.

But just because you see it as trash does not mean it actually is, trash. Fashion is a way to express yourself without actually speaking. It's not that serious. I think when it comes down to it, we all just want to look cool and the best version of ourselves. Regardless if you wear a bespoke Vera Wang or wear this ""hideous"" alexander wang. Fashion has no rules. Wear denim over denim. Prints over prints. So long as you wear it confidently.
