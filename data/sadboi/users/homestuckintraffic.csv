My college group:

IXFP- Quiet, soft spoken, but super sweet. Extremely talented artist and has a great fashion sense. Seems innocent but isn't.

INFJ- Mom friend. Really smart but doesn't flaunt it. Loves to dye her hair unnatural colors, as do I. Extremely loving and supporting and tries to make sure we make responsible decisions, something my IXFP friend and I are not always good at lol.

ENTJ- Brutally honest friend, but in a loving way. Very dirty and sarcastic sense of humor. 

My LGBT community group:

ISTP: My best friend, who I've actually known since high school, longer than we've known the other people in this group. Talented musician. Very calm on the outside and passionate on the inside. Not always good with words, tends to show affection through actions.

ESFP- Crackhead energy. Loud. Very sexual sense of humor. Comes across as selfish but is actually really nice. A bit immature.

ENFJ: Very charming and flirty. Extremely confident. Very protective.

Another ENFJ: Super easy to talk to about anything, touchy-feely

INFJ- Comes off as intense/intimidating, but a real sweetheart. Has strong intuition about people, if she gets a bad vibe from someone, that vibe almost always turns out to be right.

INFP- Cute little weirdo. Probably a furry. Quiet at first but easy to talk to.

INTJ- Intimidating at first. Blunt. Has strong opinions. Extremely protective."

exchristian,fqlkdd5,t3_gj602n,1589460319.0,"Yes, I was bullied and ostracized in youth group and sunday school for several reasons. The other kids all grew up in the church and had known each other since daycare. I moved to my current town when I was 8, and started going to the church shortly after. A lot of these kids came from wealthy families with strong connections in our town, and my family is lower middle class.

I was different from the other kids. I was very shy as a kid and teen, while the church prizes being very friendly and enthusiastic. I got called antisocial and unfriendly, which really pisses me off, because these kids almost never said hi to me, nor would they ever greet any newcomers. These kids were praised for being warm and friendly, but it was a shallow, artificial friendliness. They didn't give a shit about anyone but those in their impenetrable circle. 

Meanwhile I, despite being shy, was always quick to smile and welcome newcomers and anyone who seemed alone. I don't mean to humblebrag lol, but I just thought it ironic that the ""antisocial"" kid was the only one willing to talk to new people. New kids almost never came back, and I don't blame them.

I had already stopped identifying as Christian by the time I was in youth group (only went to make my mom happy) and I think the other kids sensed that. I had zero enthusiasm during worship. I was also starting to get into alternative fashion around that time, and I got bullied for that as well."
