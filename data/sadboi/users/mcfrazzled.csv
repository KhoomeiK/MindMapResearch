I would never be able to lie like that just to hurt someone. And someone I love, I would never ever be able to say something like that. And I'm only 22. You're 29 and this was a 2 year long relationship. This is unacceptable."
confession,fgq1f7n,t3_ezm2my,1581016047.0,"Hey, girl. When you have had time to read all these comments, and introspect about this situation, please show your boyfriend this confession. It'd be the easiest way to let him know, and believe me, he'll understand and be there for you and it'd be better for both of you. Having someone in real life that knows about your fears and reassures you is the biggest support you can get. Redditors are helpful, your boyfriend is clearly the better choice. Take care."

relationships,fgq04x5,t3_eztlrk,1581015341.0,"In such situations, what a friend should do is let the person speak up and listen to their wishes. She has already told you what she wishes. Give her some time, you are still on good terms, after a while you can maybe reach out to remind her that you're there for anything she needs. And that's it, do not try to help by deciding what she needs. Let her decide that, just listen"
relationships,feqbgf3,t3_eq81ow,1579339791.0,"Even if you weren't mourning your friend, this behaviour of ""teaching a lesson"" would have been a huge red flag. But this, I don't have words. Regardless of how much you fight, or how many misunderstandings you have, that amount of callousness towards someone you ""love"" is not normal. He doesn't care for you, and he is manipulative. You never need to beg for attention or exactly say the words 'I need you' for him to be there for you. Whatever you said is clear enough. He's manipulative, wants to have control over a situation where you're grieving and make it about himself. Dump him, OP. He's 25, not a kid. Dump him"

Probably a break up with you might work, but maybe more. It'll be a good few years before she realizes her childishness and owns up to it. But she really isn't going to learn if you let this go and stay with. Just what I think. You're young OP. You can do wayyyy better and benefit a lot from an actually healthy relationship."

relationship_advice,f5teeqn,t3_dp3zt8,1572456766.0,"Had it been me I would've avoided him completely in the future, but would definitely not have kicked him out. Specially alone, with my other two friends busy elsewhere. She told you everything, was having a open conversation with you. There's no reason for you to not trust her judgement. Honestly, it justs sounds like you were so insecure you made your girlfriend cry. That's worse than what the super-drunk asshole stranger did. He flirted with her, but YOU did not trust her judgement, made her cry even after she was completely honest with you. Almost like you punished her with your sourness because some random dude flirted with her. You are over the top, no one is downplaying the severity. Your relationship is not a material thing that strangers absolutely have to respect, and you can use the word 'disrespect' as much as you like, but it's just a projection of your insecurities. He was an asshole, but you were a bigger one"

relationship_advice,f4v998n,t1_f4srs42,1571838727.0,"This was a shitty move on her part, of course. But the real deal breaker is when you let her know it was shitty and inapproriate and made it seem like she has no trust in you, and she doesn't apologize sincerely. She half-assed the apology, meaning she doesn't see anything wrong with what she did and is only apologizing because you're mad. That kind of behaviour is never healthy for a relationship."

The fact that he is not angry at his brother for being such an asshole makes him sketchy as well. What else will he let pass? Where is his moral compass? Where does he draw a line?

Even if just that won't go far without some inclination towards improvement, it shows he cares about you and your feelings. From what OP has written, her boyfriend seems like he gives no shit about what he did to her and her expectations, her feelings, her plans and her money!"

I mean, that would be a legit reaction of ANY decent person even if they were SO IRRESPONISBLE! He fucked up big, that's awful. But is showing no remorse, isn't feeling guilty at all and saying cry all you want is the worse part? Dude is not right with his priorities and his words can't be trusted. How can you trust someone who can do this? I'm not saying dump him or anything, that's for you to decide but I'll just say one thing. This was immature and childish, now people can improve from that if and ONLY IF they realize they have this problem in the first place. Otherwise they will never ever change. Good luck, OP!"

BlackPeopleTwitter,f2xqecq,t1_f2x0zae,1570481324.0,"What he said was wrong, and even if he didn't mean it, it was poorly worded. But I think, the society we live in gives us a lot of inherent biases that we have to identify and unlearn. So, personally, if someone is ignorant of their wrong behaviour, it does not disappoint me. Probably, their first encounter with that bias. What angers me is when they don't own up to their mistake, don't try to understand the facts before them and stick vehemently to their wrong bias. Such people are bigots through and through. Terry realized and admitted he was wrong. I think that's not disappointing at all, that's what unlearning these biases is all about."

The thing is OP, even if your husband's behaviour is a one-off thing and this is never going to repeat, you should take action. Go live with your family for a day or two or someplace else that is safe. You taking action and standing up for yourself will tell him that this is not gonna fly. And that if he repeats this there will be consequences. This will send a clear message to him. If this really was an awful one off thing, he'll feel remorse and assure you that this won't happen again. If not, you'll get to see his true colours. Take action, OP! At least for your child."

In your situation, the trying to be positive part is going be excrutiatingly slow.  I hope you're not having fights with your partner when you have episodes. Remind him that you're not doing this on purpose, you're not trying to hurt him, and that this isn't about him, it's about you and it'll take time for you to get better. Sometimes in relationships we seek support from the other person, especially for our issues, but end up feeling guilty for not getting better fast enough. For this the only thing I can think of is trying to be more independent, trying to solve your problems(about these issues, like finding triggers, making strategies to avoid them) by yourself and not looking to them for support. I am currently doing this. Doesn't mean I don't share things with him or we don't talk about other stuff. It's just that looking to him for support was draining him and it wasn't helping my anxiety either. So I'm trying, I'm not doing amazing but I'm trying to see what I can do for myself without depending on him"

It's just fucking twisted that people can call you a friend and be so inconsiderate. Hang in there, OP! Because life will get you more friends, for sure. Things might seem really difficult for now, especially if you don't like small talk or interacting with new people. But please, focus on your healing. It'll be a slow process but please love yourself. You're amazing. And none of this was ever **EVER** your fault, alright? Take care"
