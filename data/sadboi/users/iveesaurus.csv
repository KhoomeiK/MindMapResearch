I wouldn't beat yourself up for having to use gel cap medications when you have to. Your diet overall makes an impact and having eggs once in awhile is okay too. When we become over-focused on things, sometimes it can drive us crazy. You're doing great. Low fodmap vegan recipes are harder to find but I made a list of all safe seasonings and spices and it helps. Also, have you tried infused olive oils? I can't have actual garlic but I can have garlic infused olive oil. Something about how in oil it isn't soluble so it doesn't affect you like raw or powdered does."

But I  reincorporated chicken and eggs into my diet because I can't digest any of my protein sources currently. I had lost 12 pounds. I just wasn't eating anything.... I miss beans and tofu so much. üòî I'm hoping I can get my digestion right again. It causes me such emotional distress to be eating how I have to now.

vegetarian,fc44v8m,t1_fc3tfij,1577406690.0,"Thank you for sticking to this despite what people had to say against you. Some people seem to forget that not everyone is the same in terms of what they can afford and manage (especially since some people are reliant on other people buying their groceries, or having to support families, etc), what their body can even tolerate, and what types of conditions/illnesses they may have. Until this year, I hadn't even thought about touching meat or dairy in 15 years. It's truly a long time. But this year I was diagnosed with severe GERD and out of nowhere I became unable to process most foods. No soy, gluten, beans, onions, garlic, tomatoes, most fruit, many many vegetables, lentils. 

I hardly ate for 3 months bc it put me in severe pain and it sent me to the ER 3 times bc it is affecting my ability to breathe. The doctors told me my body was eating it's own fat stores and was, essentially, wasting away. I had literally no choice but to reincorporate a couple of animal products in order to live through this. It is not at all something I enjoy and it pains me to do. I cried the first few weeks. I don't eat a lot of it and eat some locally sourced eggs and chicken, but I fucking hate it. And I got nothing but hate, bc people would rather be morally superior than understand things happen. I will be having surgery next year that should help and theoretically I should be able to return to my 100% vegan diet, of which I'll be endlessly grateful for. But people need to stop being so judgemental and harsh when they don't know why someone's food choices are what they are. 

Good for you for making steps to get animal products out of your diet. I'm grateful for ANY reduction in animal consumption, whether it's all at once or gradually. You're making a difference. I promise."
