>I think the answer boils down to money, and Hollywood is struggling to find the right formula that simultaneously pleases everyone while maximizing profit.

I have to strongly disagree; if it were solely about money then the studios would stop greenlighting ""Woke"" films that keep bombing, and they would stop memory-holing 'diverse' films of previous eras.

To use your example of *Black Panther,* these people act as if Wesley Snipes never existed and wasn't a huge action star (who appeared in a Marvel superhero movie called **Blade** that was so successful that it spawned TWO sequels); they pretend as if films like *Soul Food,* *Love Jones,* *Waiting to Exhale* and others never existed, or comedies like *Martin,* *Living Single,* *The Cosby Show,* *The Fresh Prince,* or *In Living Color* are figments of the imagination. 

The point is for nearly three decades now there's been a proven track record of projects with 'Diverse' casts finding an audience and doing well.

Given that track record, why, then, are studios such as Disney charging headlong into ""Wokeness'"" with their next phase of Marvel films, despite the failure of recent ""Woke"" films like *Terminator: Dark Fate,* *Charlie's Angels,* and most recently *Birds of Prey?* It's even more nonsensical given that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been one of the ONLY franchises in recent memory to consistently produce films that are international, billion dollar successes.

I think the answer is that money is in fact NOT the primary goal. And if pleasing the audience were a primary goal, then they wouldn't, for example, shit on fans of *Star Wars* for objecting to the most recent trilogy of films by calling them ""toxic"" bigots, which only serves to alienate audiences. 

**Their goal is to use their films to push social change.**

But how do you 'normalize' a trait that is only shared by a small fraction of the population? 

They've gone beyond mere normalization, beyond simply trying to help the culture become more accepting.

RightwingLGBT,fj06wi5,t3_farogg,1582891421.0,"I work in entertainment, and my new motto is ""gay is the new straight"". Ironically it's offensive because the gay/queer characters are almost never relatable, because the character is solely written to ""represent"" (their perception of) that group. They are rarely a fully fleshed out and complex individual that moves the story forward to a satisfying conclusion, their sexual identity IS the character."

I've literally had (chunky) women express disbelief that I wouldn't hang out with them because I had to go to the gym in the morning.

My last girlfriend wasn't fat, but had a little pudge and would every so often talk about her insecurity surrounding it. Not only am I a gym rat, but her best girlfriend was ALSO a gym rat. I gave her a ton of info about nutrition and fitness routines, told her where she could go for more info. 

What did she do?

When we went to the gym she would spend like 30 minutes bullshitting on the elliptical, then 'work' her ticeps with 2 pound dumbbells, then spend 30 minutes 'stretching'. After nearly a year of 'working out' she still couldn't do a single push-up, even with her knees on the ground. 

Later she would go to the gym with her obese friend, and then they would just run their mouths while they both 'stretched'. 

I overheard her talking with a friend, she said ""yeah, he works out way harder than me"". She KNEW she was being lazy. 

Funny enough, she suddenly discovered the wonders of circuit training after I dumped her. Few months after we split (and it looked like my career was on the upswing) she tried to get back with me. I did not reciprocate. 

She cut me off."

Same; I actually don't get all the tattoo hate (I guess I'll chalk it up to conservatism?), but not only is her ink excessive, but frankly it's also a garishly BAD tattoo. She wasted all that time and money for bad art that will cover her body for the rest of her life, unless she decides to undergo the expense and pain of getting it all removed.

WhereAreAllTheGoodMen,fiakvsi,t3_f6xeeq,1582303148.0,"I remember getting into an argument with an ex over a joke I made on Facebook to an old high school friend; I was stuck in an airport and made a post (in jest) looking for things to do. 

My buddy joked ""you could jerk off"" and I replied something along the lines of ""nice idea but I'd rather find someone else to do that for me"".

Cue phonecall with girlfriend, pissed about an innocuous and obviously absurd joke (why the fuck would I broadcast cheating on her?) 

This same woman--who would also get pissy if she thought my eye was wandering, who would post risque photos of herself on IG and FB and court attention/validation from a bunch of dudes I had never met; who would talk early on in our relationship about the raunchy thoughts she had about other guys, or the conversations she would have with other female coworkers--this same woman got pissed at me for making an offhand joke about getting a tug.

My point is that women will openly talk about and display their attraction to other men, even in front of their partners, but there is no way a man interested in preserving his relationship would even THINK to post something like what this bitch did, even as a joke."
