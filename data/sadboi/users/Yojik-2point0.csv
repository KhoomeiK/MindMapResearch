BPD,fn11hka,t1_fn11a0t,1586552909.0,It helps to have a community like this where we can share and be validated :)
BPD,fm94fq8,t1_fm93s7l,1585861523.0,"Oh you're all prepared! Yeah, I don't think there are just that many therapists focusing on BPD. We kinda get a bad wrap, as you've noticed...
But I really hope you hear back from the one you've found!
I also hope that maybe these days even the once who don't have it in their PT profile, offer online therapy. They better all do! Tough times!..."
BPD,fm934dt,t3_ftt0hr,1585860813.0,"Congrats on the big and important step of reaching out and starting therapy! ðŸ™Œ
I really hope you hear back soon and it all starts well for you.
I can totally relate to what you're describing and I've been at the exact same spot a little less than a year ago.
Not an expert by any means, but just want to share some things from my personal experience. I've had experience reaching out to therapist several times that never got back to me. I've heard of similar experiences. So, if that happens to you, please, don't get discouraged! Keep looking. That one was probably not the right one for you, anyway ;)
It's probably a good idea to make sure that the therapist you're reaching out to is specializing and focused on your issues. You can find most specialists on PsychologyToday website. Read their statement and focus issues. If you suspect BPD, someone specializing in BPD and trained in DBT (primaral type of therapy developed for treating BPD) might be a good option. 

Also, what I found extremely helpful, and that could be just personally me, is going into my first session I brought with me a sort of list describing what I find myself struggling with and what I hope to get out of therapy. I just wanted to cut straight to the chance with as minimum dancing around as possible. I think both me and my therapist found that very helpful.

I even still sometimes do it for some sessions, if I find something that happens during the week that I really want to bring up, but worry that on the day of the therapy I will actually avoid talking about it and unable to bring it up with details. In this case I just email my therapist prior. So I can't wiggle my way out talking about it (I have a tendency to do that).

Idk, just some advice. Hope that helps.

Good luck!!"
BPD,fm7u9iu,t3_ftixhn,1585836889.0,"The best advice is DBT. BPD can't just go away without hard work on yourself. Yes, it's your partner's responsibility to be willing and to actually take steps to work on himself. And the good news, thanks a lot of great professionals, the answers are all out there. There is DBT therapy and available for anyone DBT Skills Training workbook by Marsha Linehan.
However, I can't express how really, really hard it is to deal with BPD, even when you have all the answers and know what you should be doing. This is where a caring and loving person is an infinite help. For those moments when we're ready to give up, to remind us why we need to keep going. I think it will be very helpful for you to start learning and understanding DBT as well, to be that supports for your partner. DBT is not just for people with BPD, it's helpful life skills for everyone! Maybe you two can spend time together learning and practicing it. Also learning about BPD and DBT Skills might help you to better understand what your partner is going through, and what causes him to hide his true self that you're looking for and build walls instead. And give him a word of advice and remind of a skill to use when he needs it. There is a lot of great literature and online sources available.

No one had the right to blame you if being in relationship with person with BPD is too much and you need to walk away. Especially, if that person is not dealing with their BPD. I just want to stress our that having BPD is often compared by Marsha to being in hell. You are lucky to have an option to walk away, your partner doesn't. He'll be staying in hell, dealing with his BPD all the same.
If you decide to deal with this and think you have enough strength, just know that there is help and great resources out there. You're not alone in it and you don't have to deal with it alone!
But if you feel like it's causing you too much of a mental pain, you shouldn't torture and put yourself through hell too. That won't do any good to the both of you."
BPD,flps6sv,t3_fqb708,1585367329.0,"When my shame gets so badly out of control, TIPP skill really helps. It's just for this particular moment, when you're overtaken by emotion. Distress tolerance.
If you have a cold pack or ice wrapped in some fabrics place it on you forehead, right between your eyebrows. Bent your head down and hold for 30 seconds.
Same would work with a bucket or a bowl with cold water.
That will help to bring the emotion down to a more tolerable level.

I am sorry to hear that this is the struggle that you're going through and that sex with the loved one causes you shame and pain. I can definitely relate on a certain level. It's very hard. I think it is something that you have to bring up with your partner, thought. If the pain that you're talking about is physical, there are ways of making it better and pleasant. However, during sex so much physical pleasure depends on your psychological state, that experiencing mental pain directly affects it. I believe opening up and working on it together is the only route out of it. It takes two of you to have sex, both partners should be in sync and care for each other. I'm sure if you boyfriend loves you, he wants you feel pleasure just as much as you wish it for him. Help him to help you.

I hope there will be someone better though to give you an advise. Maybe someone who's been through this before and actually figured it out.

I hope it will get better!"
BPD,flppx77,t3_fq6dl8,1585365596.0,"I struggle with this a lot. In fact, that might be one of my most common and biggest struggle. It makes me think that I don't deserve help, that there are those who deserve it more, and I shouldn't waist people's time and my therapist's time, and that everyone thinks I'm such a faker and attention seeker, and my therapists thinks of all the people they see with real issues and thinks how spoiled I am...
Yup, big issue... Never leaves me really. 
And I don't really know how to deal with it :("
BPD,fkviaa7,t1_fktel9t,1584569764.0,"Yup! Same. I feel my calmest this days with everything going on. It's incredible!
Even finding out that I've been in close contact with officially diagnosed coronavirus patient, I still feel calm.
Social distancing and all this free personal time had been definitely good for me.

*Sincere best wishes to all who's on the opposite end and struggling, tho!"
BPD,fkc173v,t1_fkbef5p,1584043794.0,Thank you so much for your constructive advise! It's so helpful to get someone else's perspective and plus the recommended skills.
BPD,fk9gu6t,t3_fh7f9y,1583975794.0,"I feel in a very similar way.
I constantly feel like I'm out of time, and have already wasted and keep waisting my time on the wrong things. It makes me feel sad, desperate and hopeless. So, I try really hard to collect all the little precious moments of joy that I can find along the way. And also always stop for a second to celebrate any kind of achievement and remind myself how much I've wanted it at some point.

Sorry, I can't really offer much of a hope from personal experience, but maybe being in the same boat might make it feel a little better? 
I still have very similar thoughts and experience, even though I'm a bit older (26 - about 3.5 years out of college).
What keeps me going is the hope that DBT works, and the goal of DBT is to achieve ""a life worth living"". Which would be at least better than current. So, I just kinda keep going cause there is no better option, and just to see where it all will end up.
So, please, keep going. And keep finding the little uplifting things in the present moments. There must be hope for us :)

P.S. I sometimes have a voice of master from Kun Fu Panda in my head: Â ""Quit, don't quit? Noodles, don't noodles? You are too concerned about what was and what will be. There is a saying: yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift... That is why it is called the ""present"":

BPD,fk8nfm9,t1_fk8ks9x,1583959360.0,"I know exactly what you mean! I bet my therapist would've said something about chameleon behavior... Constantly changing, struggling and urging to fit in despite your own choice"
BPD,fk8k7fv,t1_fk8jw6m,1583957614.0,"Same here! Didn't realize it was shame until my therapist explained :)
Still trying to wrap my head around it haha"
BPD,fk8jvlv,t3_f34dnt,1583957434.0,"I can totally relate! I experience the same dilemma. When I feel bad all I want if for someone to come for my rescue. But if by some miracle someone is near and available, I never ever ask for help no matter how bad the things are. I want to come off as all strong and having it all together. It's heavily affecting my ability to have close relationships.
I'm terrified of being vulnerable in a relationship!

I even had this issue effecting my therapy. I would be all falling apart in pieces every single day, and then the time comes for therapy, and I just couldn't fully explain how desperately I felt. I had to put on a face like I have it all under control, getting better, practicing skills... I end up writing my therapist a bit of an embarrassing email, venting and explaining the issue. So, now I feel out cards every day to record and share with my therapist. So when I come to the session, I can't wiggle my way out of bringing up some of the things I've been struggling with.
It helps so much!
Even though on a personal level this issue is still very much a problem, and probably one of the things that tortures me the most.
Gotta work on regulating shame, according to my therapist....

Don't we all just wanted for someone to magically understand exactly what we're thinking and say all the right words, sometimes? And then, sometimes, like you said, all I want is just to be alone, for no one to see and be scared by my struggles and weaknesses."
BPD,fk8fps6,t3_fh2drc,1583955191.0,"I can relate. Especially to how you describe the two opposite sides. 
As for me, sometimes I feel shy (or maybe shame) about being shy and it pushes me  to act all obnoxious and loud, and later I feel bad and fake.
And sometimes that loud side is inside me. It wants me to stand out and dress up eccentric and everything... But the shy part (or again, shame) shuts it all down and I end up being all awkward and, again, feel bad about it afterwards.
Very frustrating!"
BPD,fk8du6x,t1_fk8d422,1583954207.0,"+ whatever doesn't kill you, makes you stronger, right? Sure, I want to concur it but idk if I just want it to magically never happen or disappear"
BPD,fk8d422,t3_fh1k1r,1583953821.0,"Tbh, idk if I'd get rid of it... I'm torn a bit about this. I guess I just don't know how it would be without it. Would it even still be me? Better the demons you know than the once you don't? Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯"
BPD,fk5iq4j,t3_fgisc8,1583881322.0,"It's very admirable that you took this step and asked for help. I find it very important to trust and rely on my therapist instead of always listening to my inner voice and broken thought patterns. Hearing how many bad experiences people have with specialists when they open up about self-harm and suicide thoughts, it must be a great relief to be heard and understood for once instead of being shamed.
Keep going! There are some amazing people out there who dedicate their careers to try and make things easier for us! Perhaps, we need to learn to trust them better and hear them out.
I wish you all the best! Hold on and keep going!"
BPD,fjl27we,t1_fjkuusd,1583438498.0,"Thanks for the welcome ðŸ˜Š
Idk, I guess it's more like a support group? I didn't even know this community existed. But even if I did, I doubt I'd ever found the guts to post myself, without this push from my therapist. I don't really have a good support system that I can trust, so maybe it will be nice to have a place where people share similar struggles and offer support.
I'll give it a try :)"
