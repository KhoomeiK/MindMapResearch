But my point still stands, yes in OLD world it is more defined, more brutal, more clinical that looks are the leading criteria. But in the real world it is still the case. You just don't get those opportunities to use your personality like that very often, especially at our age. It's not like I'm going to heaps of parties with heaps of new people like in my 20s.

dating,fjl0stn,t3_fdym0b,1583437711.0,"It's such an unfortunate fact of life that men and women are so psychologically different. These guys you date just want to have sex because it's fun. They have a biological instinct that makes them want you like that. To them it is isn't a big deal - it's not much more significant than playing a video game or a game of tennis or something, it's a fun activity that involves the participation of two people. The way they feel about you as a person and the possibility of a long term relationship is a completely separate proposition.  They can totally hate your guts but be down to have sex with you at the drop of a hat. Women, on the other hand, view it as this super important life changing event that is all tied up with who the other person is and they need to feel 'ready' for it. Guys dont even understand what that means because we are just ready for it 100% of the time with whoever. Women have this list of criteria and conditions that need to be met, and men just don't. I know people will now say it's just me or I'm a bad guy or whatever but this is my experience from the hundreds of guys I've been friends with throughout my life so I dont see how my perspective could be flawed. I'm also generalizing of course and there are different degrees and exceptions to this rule.
