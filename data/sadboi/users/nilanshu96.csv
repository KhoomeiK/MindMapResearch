Make this your only goal. People with healthy minds make mistake, lose friends as well but they move on easily something people like us find difficult to do. It's difficult but you'll have to be selfish. I can only ask you but only you can help yourself. I read meditations by marcus aurelius during my tough times and it helped me a lot.

depression,fpz3r0u,t3_ggbg9f,1589013192.0,I have lost countless friends over depression. I know the loneliness but does it gets better? Yes. Go to a psychiatrist and be open and put your complete trust in them and always keep your expectation about other people low. That way you'll never get hurt. I did a major mistake long ago by expecting a lot from others which made things worse. And be selfish and don't give a fuck about other people feelings for now because your brain is already overloaded so don't overload it with anything extra. I won't lie whether you act selfish or selfless right now people will always treat you the same. It's the sad reality of depression. Always keep your self worth above everything.

SDSGrandCross,foff1yk,t1_fofajzp,1587734443.0,Idk what you mean by common actions. If streamlining those common actions means getting a significant advantage then it's unfair. Some people even automated pvp farming by dropping several divisions and then farming coins there which is unfair. Again running the game on BlueStacks isn't cheating but making BlueStacks do most of the work for you is. If there's a background process trying to access something in the game which only the game has controlled access to can be treated as a spyware. Normally happens in a rooted mobile with a 3rd party root process reading the protected database of an application. Can also happen in emulators as well. I hope you get it now.

SDSGrandCross,fof1pbt,t3_g756po,1587722789.0,It isn't that ambiguous. The statement clearly says that you cannot use automation where it's not intended to be used such as in cases where a player gets an unfair advantage over the rest. So BlueStacks shouldn't be a problem unless you're automating things to get unfair advantage. And the 'Use of 3rd part software to play' doesn't mean using BlueStacks or any other emulator to play. But instead letting your emulator to do the work for you. If you're a technical person this statement is not ambiguous at all.

Let me give you a math of an extreme case.

Assume 2 shitty upgraded R gears with total atk = 1000

and 2 good upgraded SSR gears with total atk = 2000

Assume your character base atk = 5000

With R gears with 30% atk you get total atk = (5000+1000)\*1.5 = 9000

With SSR gears with no atk substat you get (5000+2000)\*1.2 = 8400

Remember the above is an extreme case and normally with R gears the atk easily crosses 10k.
