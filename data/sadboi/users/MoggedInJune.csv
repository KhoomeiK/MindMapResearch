The least intrusive option is to start a ssri, my memory of them is hazy but IIRC they lower your libido slightly but mostly just make penis stimulation boring because it will feel very numb.
The more intrusive routes would be double orchiectomy (there are drs that will do this no questions asked but expect to pay a few thousand).

I am kinda averse to talk therapy because it was the first thing I tried, it was just very awkward. I tried to bring up things that bothered me and then he would avert it to small talk.

Then he kept charging my insurance for a few visits afterwards.

Afterwards I mostly just tried ssri's, they don't help that much but I keep thinking maybe they will.

Last visit I had with a gp was awful because he brought up trans stuff because its in my medical records apparently. He was so based that he asked to see my tits and told me to start transitioning again, I didn't go back for a follow up.
