What if you made weapons level through use only after they reach their max cap? Exp sources don't level it, only kills with it. Few hundred kills on your Midnight Coup once it's 1010? Bam, 1011.

I like sunsetting, but I really don't think the community is going to drop this, not as is at least. And of course it's not happening until season 12 and you'll have to gather data and see how you're feeling afterwards.

A leveling system goes against what you're trying to do, I realize. But it provides a choice, if players are adamant about keeping their current loadout up to date, they can do the grind. Or they can grab new stuff and get into new stuff right away.

Some might feel a bit miffed over 'feeling forced to level their old stuff for new seasons' and such, but it would at least allow players to feel like they can play the game the way they wish to some degree.

And people aren't seeking constant stimulation, that's literally the problem, people *don't* want that. They want to be able to engage in all of the game while not feeling like they have to. They *want* to be able to take breaks without being punished for it.

You don't feel punished because you don't play the game in the same way as these guys. Yet you want to shame them for a problem Bungie intentionally created for this exact purpose."

My first run had myself and two others that just wanted to farm laurels. We were in there for at least 15 minutes on the same run just collecting laurels.

Then I finished that requirement and needed the completions. Of which the next 4 forges I basically solo'd them while the others collected laurels. Not fun."

DestinyTheGame,fo0kvzd,t3_g4pz9b,1587414970.0,"Bungie should abandon the original gambit and focus solely on prime. Any of my suggestions from here on should have that in mind unless stated otherwise.

Invaders have too much power in comparison to other roles in a game. Several suggestions I have for this are:

> Make heavy *only* from the envoy that spawns the Well for DPS. A guaranteed drop from that envoy. No enemy drops. No heavy packs. 

* There's no need for heavy before the primeval.

> Saving invasions needs to be gotten rid of.

* A team should not be able to bank 75 motes and then be able to invade 3 times in quick succession. If you bank 50 motes then invade, you should only have one invasion not 2. If you spawn the primeval before you invade, all of your invasions are gone until the enemy team spawns their primeval.

> Have the wallhacks enabled for the first 3 or so seconds instead of being constant. Then give the prime invader armor the ability to mark targets like the Reaper and Sentry sets if they want to have wallhacks again.


* I think it should be the lowest tier perk on the set because zero wallhacks would make invading completely unfun. But having to work for the wallhacks would be a great compromise.

> Give invasions after the invader's team spawns their primeval a risk.

* I believe right now it's every kill an invader gets heals the enemy team's primeval by 8%, for a total of 32%. This should also apply to the invader's primeval with an additional penalty of 8%. So if the invader kills three people they will have healed the enemy team's primeval for 24%, but if the invader then dies, the invader's primeval will be healed for 32%.

I feel that last suggestion requires more explanation. I don't think a team should be able to invade with 0 risk during their primeval phase. During the mote collection the risk is having one less person collecting motes and killing ads. If the invader doesn't accomplish much that hurts their team. Currently there is no risk to invading during the primeval phase, so I feel this is a good fix to that.

Outside of that, the Prime armor perks need a massive rework. And I think Bungie shouldn't be afraid to go a little crazy with it. They shouldn't be concerned with trying to make Gambit some esport. Just let the armor be crazy and fun enough to incentivize people to go back into reckoning and grind for it.

Gambit bounties need to be more passive and team based.

Gambit Prime armor needs to work like the Solstice armor. Instead of three tiers of sets for four sets of armor for three characters (seriously wtf were you thinking), just make it a single set that you level up over time through bounties/reckoning/gambit. 

Have it start as an uncommon rarity that can only reward so many points in the perk tiers, level it up to rare, then legendary, etc. One armor set for each role. Way better. Do it.

These are a lot of (radical) changes, but I think it would be a great step in the right direction. And of course I'm leaving out a lot as armor perks need to be adjusted, etc. But I would love to see at least some of these come to the game mode."

DestinyTheGame,fnv1ff0,t3_g40grp,1587277147.0,"We've been gathering allies.

Vanilla and Opulence we have gained favor with Calus.

Vanilla and Joker's Wild we save and assist Fallen Captain Mithrax.

CoO and Dawn we reconnected with and resurrected guardian legends Osiris and St.14.

Warmind and Worthy we have grown an alliance with Rasputin. 

Forsaken we strengthened relations with the Awoken and made an in with the Fallen.

Black Armory we sought out the assistance and gained the trust of Ada allowing us access to an armory of golden age weapons.

We forged a partnership with the Drifter. I'll admit I'm not exactly certain what he provides (not a lore expert by any means), but with his proximity to the Nine, I think he has value as an ally.

And my spinfoil hat theory is next season we will solidify our relationship with Mithrax and come to meet Uldren.

There's most likely a more detailed answer from deep lore, but from a purely in-game point perspective, that's what we've been doing. I think a lot of your questions don't have answers yet too. We're still uncertain what the darkness actually looks like or how they fight."
