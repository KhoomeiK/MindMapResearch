I think that it was the other component which was mild: ""mild water"" aka: ""wet air"" aka: fog.

Plus: At night.

This gave enough contrast even small amounts of water suspended in air, could cause small amounts of visible Cherenkov radiation happen inside each droplet, when getting hit by an insanely powerful beam directly from exposed core.

It is not a big pool of water lighting up at once but many small droplets. Air does not stop the radiation. Changing water/air mixture from a pool (100/0) into a fog (3/97) would just massively increase the distance of the effect (and make it super dim) as same amount of water would be way more spread out (air does not hold water well, 4% at most)."
