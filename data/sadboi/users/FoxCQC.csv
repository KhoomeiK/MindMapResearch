Chris's dimensional merge makes me think of that thought. Even as a kid I knew it wasn't real but I still had fun with the fantasy. Now that I'm older I find it interesting how stories influence us. I write my own stories as a hobby. I also get out and try to have my own adventures, however small. I sell merch for anime online. I'm definitely not perfect but I keep trying to better myself while also accepting who I am, inspired by the characters I love. I try to keep my passion with me in a constructive way.

It breaks my heart to see the negative side of it so profoundly manifested in Chris. I don't care about it giving a bad name to us that stain will always be there. It's just a boy ripped apart by his circumstances and inability to adapt. Maybe he could have made his passions constructive."
