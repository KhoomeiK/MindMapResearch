 >!Basically I think it boils down to Rin rejecting everything female about herself (a good example of that is when she literallly destroys her uterus instead of dealing with a period) Her rejecting her phsyical gender doesnt really seem like a part of the story, so it just ended up feeling like another reason why I dislike her as a character. It just seemed like they made the Mao charater a girl for sales but that was inconvenient to deal with so they just took the parts of being a girl that could be a hiccup to the narrative and got rid of them. Also I dont remember the book passing the Bechdel Test. I think it might actually technically pass it, but if so just barely, which is pretty sad for a book with a female lead. In general after learning more about the historical context I think I am confused about why she is protrayed as a woman at all.

You can use a bmr calculator to figure out how many you need to maintain and then subtract about 20/30% max from that and thats about how much you should be eating as a deficit. 

The next thing will be getting a food scale and a food logging app and figuring out how many calories you are actually eating. This can be really hard but is super important because things like a smoothie or a big dinner like you describe can have waaay more calories than you think. For dinner make sure you include any toppings like cheese or sourcream, cream in the meat...etc.

I have dieted for many years, trying like every fad diet there is. The only change that finally actually worked for me was counting calories. I do IF basically to help me stick to my caloric goal. I started counting calories on March 1st and am down 17 lbs. I am 24/f/5'5"" sw: 206 cw:189 and I eat between 1200 and 1400 a day (my stats are important because you gotta eat the right amount of cals for your body, too few is dangerous).

As a fair warning, they are pretty smutty/kinky due to the fact that the lead character is a sex worker. There is sexual violence but I think its well handled, meaning they often talk about consent and they address the rape that does happen. Book three does get the darkest and I always warn my friends who start reading it that it has the most sexual violence."

My favorite series for a strong female lead is **Kushiel Legacy by Jacqueline Carey**. Its pretty smutty/kinky so you gotta be down with that, and there is some sexual violence, but it is well handled (meaning the chatacters talk about consent and the fact that rape is rape), but later in the series it can get pretty dark. The first book is a little slow, and its big on names/politics in the same way Game of Thrones is. Again, to be clear: the lead is a sex worker and these books are graphic.

**The Book of the Ancestor Series by Mark Lawrence** has a great magic system that I think compares well with Sandersons magic systems. The leads are pretty much all female, and while I found a some of their dialogue weird in the beginning, I think he eventually hits the mark. 

**Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik** has amazing female leads and great prose. She also has another book called Uprooted, which is a little less strong imo but still a fun read, both are retellings of fairytales. If i remember correctly Uprooted has some sexual violence but Spinning Silver doesnt. 

**The Sevenwaters Series by Juliet Marillier** is a six book series that follows different women over a couple of generations in one family. They are more true to mythology 'fairytales' that take place in Ireland/UK. I think they really hit the line between fantasy and romance well, but each book does end with a Happily Ever After moment, which is sometimes super satisfying but if I'm in the wrong mood can feel cheesey. At least the first book contains sexual violence. I wish I had found these when I was about 17/18. I reread them when I am in a bad mood.

**City of Brass by S. A. Chakraborty** is a YA book, the third in the series comes out this June. I think its a compelling story with a super interesting setting but the lead does make some questionable decisions and the love triangle is a little eye roll-y. 

**An Ember in the Ashes by Sabaa Tahir** is the first book in a four book YA series, book four comes out this fall, while sometimes the YA-iness of this series sticks out, I found that when faced with questionable decisions the chatacters often made the not annoying choice, which I really appreciated. These were a super fun read, I think I read the first 3 in about 2/3 days because they were very bingable. I found the lead strong and relatable in many ways.

**His Dark Materials by Phillup Pullman** This has been one of my favorite series since I first read it when I was 11 and too young to fully understand it. They are great books.... They are anti-religion, which I really enjoyed, especially reading them right when I left the mormon church, but some people might not like, so I give a fair warning. The female lead can be a little shit at times but that feels pretty real to any girl her age. I really couldnt recommend them more. Also HBO just did a season one that is pretty true to the text for book one and could be fun to watch post reading."

I think the first thing you need to shed is caring about burning bridges, no matter what choice you make, you are making it for yourself and your family during a global pandemic and people will either be understanding of that (which means they are worth keeping around) or not (which means they probably suck at least a little).

Some of the important aspects that stuck out to me:

- you are immuno compromised

- your wife will have to return to work at somepoint, at which point she and your kids would be exposed to the point that you staying home wont really protect you anymore.

- your current job is pretty unfulfilling for you, while this probably isnt giving you intense strese, it could be giving you low level chronic stress the kind that weakens immune systems and is conneted to higher cancer rates. 

- new job seems like exactly what you want/need personally but is more risky for your health and potentially the health of your family. 

- you did not specify that your wife or kids are really immune compromised at all, but that might affect your decision.

I think with everything being considered, it comes down to a question of priorities. There isnt a judgement here on my part because I think this is pretty complicated, but in general I try to strive for the happiness of those around me and the happiness of myself. I think you will be a better father and husband if you are actually happy as a person. 

This is the question it would come down to for me: 

Will I be happier (and therefore a better father and husband) by ensuring the safety of myself and therefore my family, or will I be happier (and therefore a better father and husband) by pursuing a job that is more fullfilling and allows us more comfort. 

I can come up with reasons for either direction, but I do think I lean towards safety, other jobs will come along eventually. Who knows, this new company could even fail in the possible global depression hurtling towards us. but if you die, you die and then they lose you  which is horrible emotionally for them and they lose any financial gains your new job came with. 

In [workist](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/) america, its pretty hard to escape tying your well being to your work, and so if you chose safety, I'd recommend investing in otherways to support your wellbeing. 

At the end of the day its your choice, but I would make it considering your long term life goals and going for the choice that supports those most."

You were 13 when you started dating a 40 year old, which means you were a child, who was too young to really underatand the implications of what that means. He is a pedofile who preyed on you and groomed you to think that was alright.

I would not only look into getting therapy, but also making sure you keep as much proof of your relationship as possible so that you could go to the police if you decide to at any point. Years after I got out of an abusive relationship with a much older man I realized how much harm he did and wished that I could persure legal action but at the time I just wanted to be done with him and basically destroyed all the evidence. I really regret that now.  

You may not want to report him, but as a pedofile that dude may start looking for a new young girl to groom, and coming forward could protect someone else.

Advice,fp3sevv,t1_fp2qm78,1588284950.0,"I think its a lot more complicated than an ultimatum situation. It seems like you guys have a pretty decent level of communication and could probably work it out with a little digging into it, as long as you both go into the converation with an open mind.

Personally I (24/f) used to smoke but don't now, and my (23/m) bf of 6 years still does. I stopped because it makes me anxious. He still does because he likes to. For a while I found ""reasons"" why it was wrong for him specifically, even though I am not anti-weed. Eventually through a lot of conversation and some introspection, I found that I had some other holdups that I was uncomfortable with or unclear about and weed became an easy scapegoat for not going deeper and working out the real issues. 

I think having some weed at the end of the day is no different from reading a book/watching netflix/eating dessert/drinking wine or beer* (*I actually have more of a problem with drinking because its literally toxic for you body.) Everyone needs ways to unwind, and its a little unreasonable to demand that you get to decide how your partner unwinds. Maybe its just an obvious clear incompatibility for you guys, but I think its more likely there is something deeper under the surface, that with the level of communication you seem to have, you could work out with patience and care for eachother."

That being said I do get deeply engaged frequently enough to know that it happens. I would maybe reread a book you know you love in order to remember the feeling of ""this is a very engaging book"" so you can look for that feeling when reading a new book.

intermittentfasting,fovzmel,t3_g9v4r0,1588110328.0,"First thing. Eating is literally a coping method for stress, and often for younger people its one of the main coping mechanisms they can turn to. Eating literally gives your brain dopamine, so you are in no way bad or wrong for turning to food in these really stressful times. Reaching for the coping mechanisms available to you is a sign of resilience. You will get through this. 

That being said using eating as a coping mechanism might not support your health goals, so the first thing I recommend is make a list of things you can do when you are stressed or bored and when you have met your caloric needs for the day but want to eat more, refer back to that list. I do things like call a friend, go for a walk, read, watch youtube videos...etc. 

As far as weightloss goes, finding permanent lifestyle changes you could see yourself living with forever is key and what I wished I had done at 18. (I am 24 now). So instead of longer fasts, I normally do 16:8 because its much more sustainable. I eat plant based, whole foods, but I also give myself occasional treats (like chocolate vegan icecream), I just make sure to keep within my caloric intake. I used a TDEE calculator to help me figure out what my base is and then I do a 20% deficit for healthy weightloss. Healthy weightloss is SLOW, you should not be losing more than 2lbs max per week less is safer. The closer you are to a healthy weight the more weightloss will slow down. Make sure you check your BMI for what the healthy weight range is. If you find that your in your healthy weight range but unhappy with how you look, I would look into doing more exercise and making sure you are eating the right macros for muscle building as well as finding ways to love and appreciate your body, no matter what numbers are on the scale. 

Especially when you are young is is REALLY important that you dont do too high a caloric deficit. Unless you are shorter than 5'2"" you probably should not be going under 1200 calories per day. It is both bad for your goals, like it can cause your body to store fat instead of muscle because it will think you are starving, as well as screw up other systems, like make your hair fall out, cause bad acne, fuck up your digestion, and maybe worst of all REALLY effect your hormones. 

I have struggled with an ED my entire life, and I think that I am finally in a healthy place and losing weight in a really healthy way, but it did take years of learning to love my body, especially when its chunky. I only finally felt like weightloss clicked into place after I got to a place where I actually wasnt sure if I wanted to lose weight for looks anymore. The reason I do is because I want to protect my joints and arteries, I love hiking and rock climbing and if I dont lose weight now I am afraid I will lose the ability to do those things much younger than I would otherwise."
progresspics,fos1ipr,t1_forw4r7,1588022277.0,This is one of the main reasons I am working on losing weight. I did a lot of work to love my look at any size but I really want to be healthy and be able to keep doing what I love (hiking/rock climbing) for my whole life and I know my knees will be so much happy with less weight to carry.
intermittentfasting,fof4w59,t3_g70kf1,1587726127.0,"Hey I am exactly your stats 24/f/5'5"". My sw was 210 on march 1st and my cw is 190. Slow steady weightloss is the only healthy way to lose and keep it off. I have struggled with binge eating my entire life that I can remember, my weight fluctuating between 170 and 230 since I was 15...my parents put me on my first diet at 9 and it was downhill from there. I feel like we can probably really relate. 

The most important lesson I have learned is that binge eating disorder is often something that people learn as children because it is one of the few coping mechanisms available to kids. Eating literally gives us dopamine, its a real coping mechanism, and by using it we have shown that we are resourceful, because we are reaching for the coping mechanisms available to us. 

It just probably doesnt serve your health goals to continue using that coping mechanism. Finding a healthy alternative coping mechanism is super important, especially in these stressful times. Please be forgiving with yourself and patient with your journey. Healthy weightloss takes time and perseverance. You are doing great by sticking to your process.

Especially book 2 and 3. Pullman also recently released two follow up novels (and there will be a third) which are more adult and I enjoyed (although it seems many people have mixed feelings).

Stardust

The Name of the Wind by Rothfuss. This is a complicated one because I have some more complex critiques of it lately but I also read this pretty young (14 or 15 I think) and so reading it feels like going home in a way.

The Goblin Emperor. This doesnt fully count because I just read it for the first time but can already tell it will be a book I go back to often. (I had a hard time with the first three pages, but after that was hooked). I highly recommend it.

After thinking about it a little more, I think I go through periods of time where ""adult"" books can feel like such a chore to read and if I give myself permission to read some fluffy YA esc books I remember why I love reading and then find it easier to dive into more complex books. 

I also am noticing that I tend to go back to the books I loved when I was 11 to 16 and this was when I got out of the mormon church and feel like I really developed as my own person so it might have to do with that.

It sounds like you could have an eating disorder and seeking help could be really beneficial. 

If you are hesitant about that, I do recommend Bright Line Eating to some folks, especially those with more addictive personalities. Their whole plan is about shunning the idea of ""willpower diets"" and setting your self up for success by following 4 super specific rules and some other guidelines, as well as aknowledging the only way to change is to change the way you love your life. My mom and her wife both lost over 100lbs a couple years ago and have kept it off following BLE. My step mom specifically has said things similar to what you are saying about addiction and she is a doctor and has transitioned her entire work to teaching patients about lifestyle medicine, often using BLE as one of the tools she has for patients. It wasnt perfect for me but I use some of their rules as a part of my situation. It is pricey to do the system but I believe with the book and the folks at the sub you could probably get as much benefit as you would from their 2 week program.

It definitely isnt perfect, but nothing ever is.

Jacqueline Carey (author of Kushiels Legacy) writes super compelling female leads which is part of why I love that series so much.

I think I never learned how to ""feel"" full or gauge healthy portions and I am working on building sensitivity to that.

So until you can talk to a doctor to make a plan:

What you can do are simple things that are no matter what good for you. Things that are lifestyle changes that will benefit you for the rest of your life.

Cut out refined sugar and ALL soda (including diet sodas), drink 8 cups of water (or more) everyday. Stop eating any super processed foods. Make sure you are eating lots of veggies and other whole foods (like choose oatmeal over ceral and if you add sugar, instead add fruit). Choose an apple over things like chips or cheetos. 

Go on a walk everyday if possible (while social distancing).

intermittentfasting,fmeaxfh,t3_fuoxwt,1585996882.0,"A couple things:

Remember that weightloss is about lifestyle changes that you can see yourself following for the rest of your life. Its a marathon, not a sprint. So focus on making sustainable choices. Ideal weightloss is slow and steady. 

Keto/carnivore is a really high fat diet (to do it corectly and stay in ketosis you need to be eating about 8 times as much fat as you are carbs, which means you cannot eat over 20 to 30 carbs a day, which is really hard unless you live in a carb free house) and there is evidence that high fat diets can lead to diabetes. I would recommend looking into a whole food plant based diet, which is based around vegetables. You pretty much always get bigger servings eating this way because vegetables and whole grains have a lower caloric density, and therefore you get more food inside your calorie limit. All that being said is its about what is sustainable FOR YOU.

What made the biggest impact for me was calorie counting. All the dieting and IFing and whatnot made no difference until I figured out how many calories I should be eating to lose weight and started making sure I followed that. 

And finally and most importantly remember that eating, especially for young people who have less control over their lives, is a coping mechanism. Eating literally gives us dopamine. Using the coping mechanisms available to us is a sign of resourcefulness. YOU are not bad for the weight you are and you are worthy of love and respect at any size.

If that sounds teue for you, using eating as a coping mechanism just probably doesnt serve your health goals and so searching for other, healthier coping mechanisms can often go hand in hand with actually losing weight.

You got this. 💜"

intermittentfasting,flmxc63,t3_fpoquf,1585300636.0,"You know for me what has motivated me to lose weight is rock climbing. I pretty much never liked a sport before I started climbing, but now I like cardio and trail running and lifting and yoga all because they make me a better climber. 

I have been overweight for pretty much my entire life and battled an eating disorder for much of it. In the last couple years I did a lot of work to accept my body as it was, which I finally think I did do. 

BUT I started climbing and came to the teuth was that the only way to get significantly better was to lose weight. 

The point of all that is to say that I never liked excercising until I found something that I loved, and then that taught me to love a bunch of other forms of excercising. So i think its about finding a form of excercise that you actually like.

YOU are not bad for seeking comfort in this really stressful time. But, if you are anyhing like me, after you finish with a binge you feel worse.

I always try to pause when I can, try to slow down, especially while binging and ask myself if I am really feeling hungry or if I am eating because I am stressed/tired/bored and then try to address what it is.

Usually reading, calling a friend, playing a video game, or going on a walk really works to help me destress or be less bored. 

If I am actually hungry I eat, but these days I only have healthy things in the house and so I figure if I do binge, binging on apples and greens and beans is an okay choice."

intermittentfasting,fle2n88,t3_fo0ji5,1585076445.0,"Just came here to lay this down. 

Eating is a coping mechanism. It literally gives you dopamine. Food is a drug that we need to survive. Its a totally logical thing for you to reach for in this time when everything is fucking nuts. You are not bad for trying to use a coping method that is available to you. 

However, it probably doesnt serve your health goals. 

When you reach for a snack, pause and check in with yourself and see how you are really feeling. 

If you are stressed maybe call a friend to vent or journal or do whatever other things that you know work for you when you are stressed. If you are bored, read or play a videogame, go for a walk, or try to engage with something that helps you be not bored. 

If after you think about it you are still like...yeah I am hungry, allow yourself to eat something but choose something healthy and filling first and if you are still hungry after that eat more of that healthy thing.

I always eat an apple in these moments and usually after I eat one apple I am good. An apple is not really going screw up your progress and after you eat one you generally arent actually still hungry (unless you need a real meal).

intermittentfasting,fle1dwi,t1_fldzdwg,1585075758.0,"I totally understand how it can be scary to eat more. It feels like undereating is a form of control yeah? And when you do eat you are out of control?

I just want to say that at 500 calories you could be really damaging your immune system, your skin, your hair and causing your body to store as much fat as possible. Our bodies sacrifice everything and store fat when they think they are starving. Essentially you should be eating about 1200 to 1500 calories a day (or more) to get your body to think its not starving.

Once you are eating more your body will start to be able to build muscle and that will also help you get more healthy.

I am in a great place wih my ED and feel super healthy these days. For the longest time though I had to stay away from anywhere with any sort of before and after pictures or that talked about weightloss. I also had to ask my parents for help as a teenager and they got me into some therapy. That is a legitimate option. 

It sounds like your parents want you to be healthy also and if you went to them and were like I am worried I might have an eating disorder and need help they will probably help you find a therapist you could talk to. 

I really hope you can prioritize being healthy and try to eat more. 💜 im rooting for you."
intermittentfasting,fldym67,t3_fo9io9,1585074250.0,"I do want to say that I lived in Senegal for a year when I was 19ish and wanted to lose weight very badly and knew my host fam gave the extra food to the beggar kids outside so I just ate as little as I possibly could while staying polite to my host family and I definitely eventually went into starvation mode and my immune sytem, skin and hair got super fucked up, my fat to muscle ratio went up even though I was being very active, and it took probably about a year for my digestive track to get back to normal and to stop getting regular infections. 

(Of course some of that could be due to other things that happened to me while I was there but based in talking with my doctor I am pretty sure that most of it came from ""starvation mode"")

I really believe that a few longer term fasts can be beneficial for us but that its really important to eat enough calories regularly. Right now im in a deficit to keep losing weight but I pretty much never eat under 1200 unless im doing an extended fast for a couple days.

I know what its like to feel terrible about your body and to want to change it but I promise continuing down this road will be more painful. For me I had to completely stop weighing myself and instead focus on feeling strong and healthy, and I highly recommend that instead. 

Based on your stats you are tiny and definitley should be eating over 1000 calories a day minimum. It seems like the reason you feel bad after eating (bloating and the like) is because you are actually eating too little, and if you more consistently ate healthy foods throughout the day you will start feeling better.

I do walk between 2.5 miles and 6 miles per day also but normally I climb and do cardio so I actually have been working out less in this last month. 

I cannot express enough how much I think calorie counting is the thing. You just gotta make sure your in the happy zone of getting enough food that your body doesnt go into starvation mode (which stores fat and fucks with your immune system, hair, and skin) and also staying in a calorie deficit."
intermittentfasting,flduxzs,t1_fldrly7,1585072207.0,"Two ideas, one is pretty well known and the other is maybe not.

1. Weightloss slows down as you get lower in weight. Thats normal. It will take longer now.

2. Goal weights are often chosen off of BMI charts and the like, the thing is BMI barely takes muscle mass into account so if you have a lot of muscle 140 looks a lot different than someone with no muscle. 

* 140 is a random number.

I think its really easy for us to get our heads wrapped around a goal weight but that sometimes when you hit a plateau so close to your goal weight you might have found where your body comfortably likes to sit.

For me my goal weight is a guess based loosely on bmi. And from there I think I will feel it out by what feels strong and healthy around that weight."
