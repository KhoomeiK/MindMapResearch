I was the parent until I left at 18. I was the usual therapist and caretaker, but it was primarily financial.  There was a period in time where he was only doing contract work and made me think we were living basically in poverty. I had a minimum wage job for most of high school, and he frequently made me pay for groceries, so I watched my tiny savings be drained every time I built it back up again. He basically used me as a bank whenever he was out of money, and I thought I was the only thing keeping us from starving. We went an entire weekend without power during a Canadian January because he failed to pay the bills. I started paying my own phone bill at 14 because he stopped paying for months and got our contract completely cancelled. I paid for pet food under the threat that my dog would be surrendered if I didn’t. I also frequently bought him things because I felt it would give him less of a reason to get mad at me for something arbitrary later in the day. 

It took me a long time to add up that he paid for an expensive house, drove a fancy car, and still bought himself lunch every day, among other things. I know anyone else would think I’m an idiot for that, but he played so many mind games that I was certain it was my only option to pay. After going back to court to determine child support, he came home ranting about how he was “starving” because he sent my mother so much money already that he had nothing to live on. He had never actually paid her at that point. I learned years later that he had also been borrowing tens of thousands of dollars from my grandparents at the same time."

The reason I mention this is because the transphobes like to bring up the XX/XY argument a lot, but it’s possible to be neither. What then?

There are also species other than humans with WAY more independent sexes, and I have no idea what their names are. Some organisms only have one sex.

Getting into vet school is no small feat, and I think it's admirable that you're working towards that. You're working towards a dream, which a lot of people don't have the courage to do. More importantly, you're also only 18. I know lots of people who had no work experience coming out of high school, and I didn't start getting good grades until well into my third year of university. If school is causing you this much pain, I'd recommend taking a step back and allowing yourself to take some time off. I'd also recommend seeking out a therapist to help give you more perspective. Even if you can't get in to see someone right now, there are probably practices and free services that are taking phone appointments in your area.  

Back in high school when I was struggling a lot with similar things to what you're saying, I had a therapist who gave me a workbook where one of the tasks was to write down three things a day for a week that were good and that I was proud of myself for. Honestly, I couldn't do it. I couldn't think of anything redeeming about myself. Looking back now, I see how wrong I was about that. I had lots of redeeming qualities, and I know you do as well. The fact that you have the desire to help people is a testament to that. Your output, whether it be in terms of a job or school, does not determine your worth. You are allowed to cut yourself some slack, especially right now when the world seems like it's been flipped on its head."

Personally right now I am on pregabalin, which is doing wonders for my anxiety. It's not technically an antidepressant, but it works. I've had to deal with some weight gain, but other than that I had virtually no side effects.
