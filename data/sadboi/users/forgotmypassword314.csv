I cardio for my life because I'm fat and need to lose weight. I weight lift substantially less often, but I do it because it helps give me the muscular strength to do more intense cardio. It also builds muscle which will burn more calories just by being there.

BipolarReddit,fglh6l6,t1_fgkuen2,1580897549.0,"This really hits the nail on the head. I used to be like OP, and I think what happens is that doing all these positive things can shift your mood for some time period. You start to think - wow, I put in effort and I go running and do cbt and it helped me so much - these other losers are just letting the illness defeat them and are being lazy!! I thought it too.

Then just like the parent comment of mine said - it stops working. That little slight modification in mood that you thought was the solution to all your problems just stops working.

I think Jim Carrey once said that you know, yoga, working out, eating right - they all help to give you a fighting chance with your illness. But the most they do is give you a small mod until the full blown, unmitigated, devastating mood of your illness decides to kick in again.  This is the depression side for bp2 folks. I think these things help you when you're not sitting in that particular mood range, and can regulate your mood *when it's in a position to be able to be regulated*. That's not to say to just give up, roll over, and die. But I truly believe the magnitude of where you are in the ebb and flow of your mood is the deciding factor in how you feel. The other things we do just give us a fighting chance. 

I'm with ya in spirit, but have a little mercy on the people whose moods aren't so strongly influenced by external factors. Some things just don't work for some people all or any of the time."

That's not to say that I don't understand where you're coming from.  Perhaps you're eating a bit more than you like, and it feels very dramatic because of the break from running.  I'm kind of in the same boat, I'm on a break from running due to the weather, and I feel 100% out of control when it comes to eating (but tbf, I actually am out of control.  I'm eating 6k calories on average per day).  The running does something to my stomach and dopamine which makes it feel like I'm less concerned about eating whatsoever.  Without that, I feel - idk, wild or something.

For you, I'd just suggest an environmental or slight habit change.  First, go to the grocery store ONE TIME per week!  If you get a treat, at least you've only done it one time.  Secondly, minimize the guilt over your ice cream at night, because if you build it up into a big thing, it will become a big thing.  As I said, it actually sounds quite peaceful and self-romantic, but maybe you're concerned about the AMOUNT of ice cream you're eating.  I'd say - instead of going to a grocery store, try to go to a shop which has individual servings of ice cream, like on a small cone.  Then, you can eat LESS, but have your ice cream and eat it too, or however the saying goes.

I think we'll both be better once we start up running again.  Good luck love!"

But, given what you said is a fair assessment of the situation, I'd say - try another university. There are lots of universities that don't have anything near the academic hierarchy you've described.  Where I work, you're defined by the magnitude of your grants you bring in.  As a prof, you don't really have academic supervision by anyone else. Everything is self-motivated. You create your lab, your work and research thrusts, your graduate students, your undergrads if you want them, everything. No one else tells you what to do except in administrative manners. 

If you would prefer not to leave, speak directly with your PI and explain your wishes. They can get on board nor not. Furthermore, what makes you think this other supported postdoc PI would be your supervisor? Why do you have to run your ideas by him at all? Nobody cares about him, you'd be at the same level as him anyways. Just do your own work and apply for grants and develop ideas and research on your own. Using these first grants as a springboard WHILE you have support from your  PI can launch you somewhere even better where you have even more academic freedom.

trashy,f57shry,t1_f55z5cl,1572042674.0,"The point of my comment was not to investigate the nuances of how a piece of shit was created. It was to discern a medical condition from bad behavior. 

The first thing that people say when someone does something atrocious is that that person must be mentally ill. It's not necessarily mental illness that's driving them - it's just what you said - their upbringing and whatever other factors. Just because we like to sit here and pretend that all people are rational and good and reasonable, and so there MUST be something special about this guy (i.e., mental illness) to create his behavior, it's simply not so. Sorry, people, some people are just walking garbage (for whatever reason, unrelated to mental illness). 

In conclusion, just because someone is shitty doesn't mean they're mentally ill. That is and was my single and sole point."

bipolar2,f4oanzq,t1_f4kyvag,1571698657.0,"However, I will say - some students are different than the rest. And it can be glaringly clear to their professors, but mostly any observant TA. I literally watched life drain from some students' spirits during some semesters. It was absolutely terrible.

Some students left the university, and later came back. Some changed universities. Some were able to get therapy through the university, and some just got deep leniencies through the Office of Disabilities, and I was glad to give them as much help and time as they needed.

However, I will say that my bipolar students, I cherished the most. I know what you're saying when you say that you ""know"" that is their diagnosis. People look at bipolar as a disability, but it's really a gift. I am an engineer, and some of the ""grandiose ideas"" from them were goddamn revelations. If your child can learn to grab the reins of his illness and learn to keep himself in check, it can be quite the asset for him in the future."
bipolar2,f4o98fz,t1_f4kyvag,1571698094.0,"Remember that you're talking to a bunch of bipolar people - that is the sample that you have queried. Thus, your sample, made up of only bipolar people who have been through this will obviously say that they have. So, in your mind, you'll say oh - so these behaviors are linked to bipolar. 

That isn't true. Everyone here would say they breathe. Does that make breathing a symptom of bipolar? No. So, perhaps if you asked the general public of college students, many without bipolar, they'd say they have experienced these very symptoms.

Don't let confirmation bias get you. I have my PhD and have worked with students for many years. Lots of them - if not all of them - have the behaviors you're describing, at least at some point.  For some reason, you seem to not want to describe the actual behaviors that would somehow make him/her fit the symptoms of bipolar. But the other stuff you've described? Regular kid stuff."
bipolar2,f4jdarm,t3_dkkuy3,1571617458.0,"Can you clarify several things here? You said he's bipolar 2, but never been diagnosed. How can you know he is bipolar 2?

You say he's hypomanic, but then you went on to say he's sleeping a lot. This is the OPPOSITE of the hallmark symptom of hypomania.  

How old is your child and what year is he/she in college? If they're in their first or second year, it sounds like how most kids act in college. Some never adjust and act like this the whole way through. They're just adjusting and learning to be without their parents. Exploring what it's like to make their own decisions and pushing boundaries.  Evaluating consequences. This sounds like regular kid stuff. Is there something that you think is distinguishing from regular kid stuff?

The one additional thing I will add - and this may not apply to you *whatsoever* - is to think really hard about if you're pushing them into a specific major they're not interested in.  Some students become very dejected and start making distance between themselves and their parents because they're being forced to do something they don't want to - and yet they'll still do it, begrudgingly, because you told them to do it."

And then make a salad with lots of different types of greens and vegetable toppings. The coolest part is that olive oil (don't get too crazy, though) is a great dressing. Especially mixed with some red vinegar and salt and pepper - yes, delicious!

Then, just eat a BUNCH of that which can potentially be super filling and have SOME of the amazing dinner that your family makes.

Maybe even say you want to make an ""appetizer"" and just have cut vegetables with some hummus or something beforehand. Maybe it can help you to eat less of the wonderful food you're talking about."

That would be one-up like if maybe they had it more years or something, but I feel like it would come off differently. 

*Would* that be different for you? I would be annoyed in your situation with the sister, not because of the one-up-ness, but because she's comparing your tiredness, a medical issue which you didn't choose, to tiredness she literally chose for herself when she decided to have kids."
