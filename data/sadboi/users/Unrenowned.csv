CPTSD,fq0invw,t3_ggedaf,1589032433.0,"Same story! I was mute until 5 also. I started using drugs at age 13 and I had a flurry of abusive relationships as well that further traumatized me. It’s good that it breaks your heart now. Because you can use that pain to motivate yourself to live a better life. It is possible. And it shows you care about your inner child a lot, which is key for all this"

makinghiphop,fpf1eoy,t1_fpeuznh,1588559554.0,It will totally warp it more because DeEssers cut out specific frequencies. But if you simply put it on a synth or something then it’s kinda just like EQing our certain frequencies.

CPTSD,foxyccq,t3_ga5k6f,1588160340.0,"Yeah. With work and effort you can reach that potential though. I know it sounds like bullshit and your inner critic, which was put there by your (I’m assuming) kinda shitty parents, will tell you that you’ll always be hindered by your trauma. But that’s not true. Believe it. Even if you don’t believe it now start telling yourself that. If you need help reach out. With time and effort, you can be the person you wanna be. You know within what you have to do."
Stoicism,foxuwzx,t3_ga2xd0,1588157129.0,"I’ve experienced something similar. Educate yourself on the illness, and what it means to be emotionally, mentally, and spiritually healthy to you. Find people who are like how you’d imagine yourself being if you were “healthy” and stick with them. Buddhism, stoicism, exercise have all helped me immensely. Be compassionate to all, most importantly yourself, because if you do not treat yourself compassionately you can’t treat others compassionately."
CPTSD,foshcl5,t3_g93qgz,1588030726.0,"I’m just like you. I chew tobacco, hunt, and have severe CPTSD from my parents. It’s very isolating. I feel like I’m supposed to be strong and confident in all areas of life, but I was neglected emotionally and socially so much that I seem like a “little kid” to some people, and I’m a full grown adult."

makinghiphop,fonfqkc,t3_g8gurc,1587918627.0,"Yes, definitely! That’s how you get better! Pushing your limits is how you expand your craft, and it’s a sign of ambition and work ethic."
pornfree,fon9o9a,t3_g8fva7,1587915202.0,"I’d say yes. If you’re prone to mental illness porn can really fuck your brain up. The hyper stimulation at a moments notice is not good for the reward centers in your brain, which in turn makes other things less pleasurable with time, aka anhedonia, a symptom of depression"

CPTSD,fojimdk,t1_fojebm9,1587821911.0,"I don’t take it as patronizing at all. Thank you for your comment. Yes I know of mirror neurons, and yes this makes sense. I was neglected in about every way"

Everyone acts inconsiderately sometimes, even neurotypical people, but afterwards, making amends should be priority if you value the relationship. No one in the world will ever understand you how you understand you, and that’s a tough pill to swallow but once you accept it it makes a lot of things easier.
