Basically. I want someone to monitor if I am starting to get psychotic without realizing.  I think my monthly psychiatrist visits may be enough. I don’t know if it would be worthwhile to go over my past or if I should just let it be.  Also, I feel shame for past mistakes and like people would be repulsed if they knew about it.
