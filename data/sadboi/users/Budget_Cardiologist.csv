I get that you may love the SO an don't want to separate the family.  However you have to stop thinking he will change ever on a permanent way.

Its very positive, but I would say the quote is more about just that, being positive, and having hope.  Kind of like the 'I think I can' story with the train engine.   The best thing for kindness is to avoid negative people as much as possible, or surround yourself with positive people.  This is really hard when some of the most negative people in your life are your parents.  Its not easy to fly, but its possible, and I believe you can."
