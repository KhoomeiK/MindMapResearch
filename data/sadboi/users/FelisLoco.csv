thedivision,fmjujbm,t1_fmidjzd,1586138036.0,Thank you for the details. This is very helpful. We're prioritizing these enemies to get them (and rocket launchers) out of the fight before they can hit us.
thedivision,fmjqo2q,t1_fmib971,1586135739.0,Thank you. The rushers and RC drones were a nightmare for a long time. We've got a handle on the rushers now and prioritize the grenadiers. The RC guys are often a ways off and hiding so we still need to develop tactics for that. We try to listen for the cars and blast them before they get close and trace it back to the source. It's great to shoot the RC and grenadiers so they catch fire and sometimes take out nearby enemies too.
thedivision,fmjq7ct,t1_fmi8m23,1586135465.0,Thank you. We're prioritizing the grenadiers first (unless there are rocket launchers) and that has helped some. We're just now seeing healers and we'll have to prioritize them too.

The government does audits once in a while and your management will probably send out expectations for questions and answers if you are picked. Just be honest.

Add to that my much earlier wake time for work and her inability to get back to sleep if she's awakened and it makes sleeping together non-viable. We've been sleeping separate for almost 20 years and while I wish it was different, we have a good marriage and this doesn't bother us much. It's nice having my own space to get ready for work and relax at night too, and she's happy to lay down with me if I want her company."

TheNSPDiscussion,f4owui5,t3_d37u4f,1571710243.0,"I was about to submit a post on this topic because I've been catching up on the last few episodes and noticed the stories have a tendency to just stop before there's any attempt at a proper ending. ""It's in the Yard"" and ""Clown Control"" are examples. ""Green Rain"" and ""Death in the Family"" in the latest episode also just abruptly end. Is  this the new normal for this podcast?

Some  of the stories are pretty cool but the lack of an ending ruins it for  me. I've been venturing off to The Magnus Archives, Knifepoint Horror,  and some others to supplement and maybe replace my NoSleep listening."

I don't have Instagram. Please feel free to send a private message to this account on reddit and I'll do my best to answer your question. If you have a pic, you can just post it on imgur or a similar service and link to it in the private message. Just keep in mind I'm not medically trained so I can't formally diagnose things."
Lipoma,eq4r6mt,t3_bx6otu,1559783687.0,"I don't think anyone can diagnose you without seeing the lump. It definitely sounds like it's a lipoma and if it's not growing quickly I wouldn't stress over it. Can you visit a doctor to get it examined? Lipomas are very common in general and in the abdominal area especially and a physician should be able to examine it quickly and tell you whether it's a lipoma. 

I'm naturally very anxious and used to freak out when I found a new lipoma, but after the first several (had first two surgically removed but stopped when I got more of them) I learned to take them in stride to some extent. I'm 53 years old and have probably 30 right now. It's annoying but not a serious health problem. 

I hope this helps. Please feel free to ask if you have other questions."
