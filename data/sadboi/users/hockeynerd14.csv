Some bouts of real pain and sadness spike through the haze now, but that‚Äôs all. Every day on the commute I hope the bus crashes. When I wake up, the only thing I‚Äôm looking forward to is going back to bed. Sleep is like a miniature reprieve where I get to stop existing for a while. Then morning comes and reality in all of its bleakness slowly asserts itself.

I wish I knew how to make it better. I wasn‚Äôt always like this. I used to be passionate and engaged. I had friends and love. Now I feel dead inside and utterly alone."

This is not the first time this has happened.

There's no special catastrophe today, things are still functioning, but a switch has flipped. I have a problem, and it's time for a change.

Though it's a different manifestation of the same problem, I will eat well today. And I will not drink today."

depression,f4ss7nm,t3_dlfw2v,1571780476.0,"I'm doing exactly what I need to to appear healthy, keep the bills paid, and not tip off my family or anyone close to me that it's as bad as it is. Every day, I struggle to find the will to get out of bed. To do anything at all, let alone the performance of normalcy. I can't kill myself-I'm too needed to do that to my wife, which is, so far, \*barely\* enough motivation-but I \*feel\* like death-oblivion-that total annihilation of the need to do anything or be anything-would be such a relief. There are people who care about me that I know I'm important to, but I still feel cripplingly lonely. Knowing that is almost a burden-I'd rather they didn't, that way I wouldn't feel obligated to stick around and act like everything is ok. I don't feel seen or heard or wanted or needed. I don't think there's anyone who \*misses\* me-like really, really wishes I was around, or would miss me if I was gone. There'd be hurt and disappointment, but they'd be fine, and they'd get over it, and in the meantime they barely notice whether they see me or not. I fantasize every day about getting hit by a car or killed in a freak accident. I was recently in the most beautiful place I've ever seen and all I really felt like doing was casting myself off the cliff.

Yeah. I get it. Every minute is a struggle. The burden of performance is so heavy. I barely remember what happiness-somewhat consistent happiness, beyond an orgasm or a sugar cookie or an alcohol buzz-feels like.

You're not alone. I wish knowing I'm not helped, but I even feel, oddly, a little more pathetic. Like I've lost one of the few things that qualifies as unique or special because so many people feel the same way. Sigh.

I feel...like a ghost whose body forgot to die. Trapped and hopeless in this meaningless existence. Doomed to keep marching until death finally takes me."

DDLC,eyqinf1,t3_cxglbd,1567344355.0,"It‚Äôs because love is a *dangerous* feeling.
At its best, it inspires, uplifts, makes us do good, and is force for happiness.
It also leads to stalking, obsession, and when unrequited, some of the most exquisitely horrible pain humans can experience.
Love is humanity at both its best and worst.
It inspires wonderful behavior, and literal murder. (The law recognizes ‚Äúcrimes of passion‚Äù for a reason!)
And it doesn‚Äôt matter how old or mature one gets...
Love can always sneak up on you, consume you, and make you crazy, if you let it.
Older folks have affairs. Remember the astronaut stalker?
People don‚Äôt like hearing this, but wisdom often demands that love be kept in check, or even disregarded.
Then again...loving and being loved back is the best human beings can ever feel, I think.
Kind of like the safety of a campfire on a cold, dark night.
I guess all I can say is we need the warmth, but we can get burned...so don‚Äôt just jump into the fire. ;)"
DDLC,eyd9jzb,t3_cudjsp,1567014123.0,"Free will is a massive paradox, and you can drive yourself insane-literally-giving it too much thought.
Matter and energy all behave according to a set of rules we have observed and tested in a laboratory.
Human beings-bodies and minds-are made of the same matter and energy, and governed by the same rules.
Brain scans show that decision centers actually light up *before* logic centers do-the implication being that our thought processes are usually about creating rationales for choices we've already made, rather than making choices.
But those same laws break down at the subatomic level, and we hardly understand quantum mechanics at all. So maybe there is space for something we haven't measured yet, and that something could implicate consciousness and free will.
In the end, it doesn't really matter. Choices lead to consequences, whether they're really freely chosen or not.
You still have to act, and the consequences, good or bad, will still fall on you, whether you really have control or not.
But it is a fascinating rabbit hole.
