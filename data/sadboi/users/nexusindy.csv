AskReddit,f77qgkx,t1_f77pejp,1573471030.0,"You'll probably get a a lot of shit for your comment but I don't think you deserve it. Your comment is brutally honest and I would expect it mimics that of a lot of people.

Personally, I was assaulted almost a year ago now. I had to see that person almost every day for 8 months. 

Have you ever been burgled or had your house broken into? Most people feel violated, out of control. This thing happened and they didn't expect it and were not emotionally prepared for it.

Now imagine you find out your neighbour is the one who did it. Now every day when you get home you see your neighbour looking through their window at you. You don't think they'll do it again, but they'll taunt you with it. 

Every day you see them your brain remembers that feeling of being violated and out of control. Eventually you start to feel anxious on your way home because you know that feeling is coming. You start wondering if your cars going to get broken into like your house. So now your brain starts feeling anxious whenever you come home and whenever you go to get in your car just by association of thought.

Your neighbour moves but it's not over. Your brain can't rationalise the threat is gone. Instead you still get that feeling on the way to the car and as you walk up to your car. You tell yourself it's okay, they are fine, but your brain won't listen. You start seeing people in crowded streets that look kind of like the neighbour that broke in, so you start getting anxious going anywhere with crowds. You won't speak to the new neighbour, you know they are fine but you're still nervous, on edge.

Is that what's its like for everyone? Probably not. Can you relate to that? Maybe not on an emotional level, but I hope that it helped to explain in a more relatable why we struggle years on. Even if you don't understand fully the best thing you can do is agree that we are affected by it."

Please talk to your children when it's appropriate. Mine didn't till it was too late. Life would have been a lot different if I had known. I absolutely would have been able to handle knowing about her illness and made adjustments to my life accordingly. Instead I thought she was a terrible parent and now she's dead.

Yes, that's harsh and hard hitting. It needs to be. She was an amazing parent with what she had and we could have helped.

So please, talk to your kids, but speak to a therapist about it first, particularly a child therapist so you do it in the right way.

Love to you"

It doesn't matter what level you are, receptionist through to exec, if you are a female in one of the companies that still allows this behaviour then you will experience it no matter who you are or what you do. 

I say ""one of the companies"" because I firmly believe that it is not exclusive to everyone in the industry. Occasionally I see equality. Mostly I see men being sexist in so many regards, and senior management not only knowing it happens, but allows it and even contributes to it.

Frustratingly, they are pushing to hire more woman. This is NOT the right approach. There are not enough skilled people in our industry of ANY gender. Limiting the pool to only woman means you are hiring based on gender and not skill. Not only is that equally sexist, but it fuels the fire if that woman is not 125% on her game. She is used as an example for why woman should not be in the industry and only make its worse.

Hire the person whose right for the job. If you really want more woman, bring them in at the intern/apprentice level and train them up. Go to schools and create an environment where people want to worth with you and gender is not even considered."
