I agree to an extent that weight loss happens in the kitchen. Eating correctly AND exercise will help you lose fat. Muscle weighs more than fat, so the number on the scale is irrelevant. The more muscle you build, the higher the metabolism will be, which leads to more calories burned. 
I agree it would interesting to hear more about his diet. Did he have gastric bypass? Is he on a keto diet?

Seahawks,fhbbgli,t3_f294o8,1581438829.0,"I agree that Beanie and Cobb might be too expensive. 
Brockers would be an excellent addition to the DL. We need someone at DE to take Collier under their wing to get him up to speed. I hope he isn’t one of those great college players that doesn’t translate to the NFL very well. 
We have need help on the OL for WAY too long. Will Britt be back at C? Could Dotson be that veteran anchor we’ve needed on the OL? Someone to take charge and get the rest ready to play at a higher level? Could you imagine Russ and the RB having an OL to actually block for them?
It would awesome to see Fowler playing with Bwagz and KJ. But at what price? 
Would Henry be too expensive at TE? We have Luke and Hollister, they aren’t top tier, but not the worst. 
Drake might be a better choice than Hyde. Or maybe a less expensive choice. 
I think Thuney may be worth the money. That OL anchor we need. 
I like the idea of picking up Armstead. Anything to weaken the 40 Whiners and boost our DL."
