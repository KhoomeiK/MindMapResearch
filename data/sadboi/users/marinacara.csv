I will say, the group dates that involve physical challenge don't overly bother me though because in the 4 seasons I've watched, I remember them being evenly dispersed regardless of the lead. On Colton's season there were two very physical group dates; there was the one where the girls were competing and if I recall correctly Onyeka won. And there was also the date in Thailand (correct me if I'm wrong) where the women were also doing some form of MMA (again, correct me if I'm wrong and ignorant). Demi broke down on that group date. There was also a wrestling date and demolition derby on Arie's season, both physical activities. Becca had a dodgeball date and a football date.

I also feel like, 9 times out of 10, physical fitness and wellness is a value to the lead, so I believe production tries to incorporate that into some of the group dates. 

Also! The Scotland (similar to the Thailand date) date felt less about making the men compete and more about exposing them to a cultural practice/tradition that just so happened to be physical."
