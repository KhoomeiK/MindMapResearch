The [industrial revolution](https://www.historyonthenet.com/industrial-revolution-working-conditions) is one of the best examples in recentish history of humans being exploited to reduce the cost of business and thus be more competitive.  I highly recommend you take a very quick look at the link above.

It was common place to have child workers (cheap labor), 80 hour work weeks, minimal pay.  I think you and I agree that it's a good thing we do not live in that era.  But what's the main difference between then and now?  Automation driving down the value of labor?  No, we have more automation than ever.  Free market?  Actually no, free market is defined as business having the freedom to choose their own prices and we have that today as well.   It's government regulation.  There was zero government regulation in the industrial era, and while it started off great it quickly became abused to improve their company's bottom line.  

In a competitive market, the smaller your production costs are the more likely you are to stay alive.  So inevitably the ""good"" companies go out of business because they pay their employees a living wage, while the ""bad"" companies stay afloat.

Now, I know how easy it would be to just say this is all misinformation spread by the government to keep them in power, but I really hope you take a serious look at the logic above.  I'm not against you; we are both just regular people trying to find our way.  Let me know your thoughts

You can't be the asshole for something you didn't consciously choose to do (flinch).  But you have to ask yourself if you _actually_ enjoy it.

I don't think boyfriend is the asshole because this ""playfighting"" seems to be something you communicated to him that you enjoy, but now he's struggling with the thoughts that he might be an abuser.  I think hec actually cares but is now questioning himself"

It doesn't seem like you even did anything to be judged for asshole-ness.

OP: *sleeps*
BEST FRIEND:  Reeeee.  You're out of the project

Unless there's something you're not telling us, there's nothing to be judged here.  No action = no asshole"

A TV is definitely expensive, but the younger brother is not a verbal punching bag.  Younger brother broke it by accident (per your previous clarification) and may deserve scolding... but not abuse.  Older brother is just acting out because it's an inconvenience to him and he doesn't seem to have the empathy necessary to deal with these situations, he only sees himself"

Look, let's take a step back.  What is the difference between taking family photos and posting them on facebook.  One is about immortalizing memories and moments in your history, the other is about sharing these memories with the world.  And your mom needs to decide which is your primary interest.

Your sister has no interest in sharing her image with the world, in fact she actively removes them. But she's present in the photos and in the family event, meaning her primary interest is in capturing these memories.  And if you/your mom proceed to share these memories against her interests she may choose to not participate in future photo ops all together, which would be the true tragedy."

Going a little against the grain on this one. I had to think about this for a while...

1)  First and formost YOU ARE NOT THE ASSHOLE (obviously).  You have an eating disorder, and while you absolutely should be treating yourself better and healthier, giving in to your compulsions does not make you an asshole.

2)  Like it or not but neither you or your BF have control over what is ""physically attractive"".  I would appreciate having the open and honest discussion about his emotions rather he keep his thoughts to himself untill it inevitably blows up.  

3)  Your bf has expressed that he loves you no matter what (which goes beyond mere physical attraction, this is an emotional attraction) and I believe your bf wants you to be healthy.  But being healthy means moderation (neither extreme weight loss or extreme weight gain).  Just because you used to live on one extreme of the weigh scale does _not_ make it OK to swing to the opposite side.  Both are equally deadly and good on him for pointing it out."

BUT depending on how aggressively you ""literally threw him"" out of your room, you may need to consider how you treat your little brother, a how that treatment of him may be reflected in how poorly he respects you/your things."
SuicideWatch,eqry322,t1_eqqt68s,1560272465.0,"I hear you man, this totally resonates with me.  I keep telling myself that, if the urge to kill myself gets stronger I'll quit and travel the world with the money I slaved to save up.  I mean, it's at least marginally better than dieing _without_ having done that.

What career are you in and what would you rather be doing?"

You've put thought into the gift?  Check.
Gave a quick text to subtly ask if it's ok? Check.
Have no other way to deliver said gift?  Check.

Maybe just give him a quick text saying ""I'm getting a gift delivered to your place"" a day or so before you expect it to arrive so they don't freak out."
