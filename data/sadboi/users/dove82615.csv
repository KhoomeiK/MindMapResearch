I take the NCE on May 19th and I haven’t started studying. To be honest, I thought it was going to be postponed until June (it was already postponed from March, and many of my classmates had theirs postponed into the summer) but alas, mine is still set for the 19th. 

I have 10 days to cram for all the subjects I didn’t do so well in on comps (career, group, & assessment). I was wondering if anyone else is in a similar boat right now regarding testing. What strategies or helpful tricks have you learned? Should I even study or just take practice tests at this point?  Anything is helpful :)"

Outside of internship hours I am still required to be meeting my billable expectation for my regular job. (40hrs total; 20 billable). I also have 2 classes on top of that. I keep telling myself it’s only a few more months but Im worried I’m going to start losing the capacity to be fully present with my clients.

AskPsychiatry,fi7ukn8,t1_fi7s1hc,1582228443.0,"I’m trying to find a better way to explain what I mean. Every therapist has a different lens through which they view mental illness. Some of them have a more straight-forward and fact-based approach, others may view it from a more a person-centered, strengths-based approach. It sounds to me like your therapist was using a strengths-based approach with you (ie: trying to have you focus less on your diagnosis and more on you/yourself as an empowered individual with many strengths and supports). You are not defined by your diagnosis but you can develop the tools and skills within yourself to cope with it. Your therapist wasn’t suggesting you go off meds, she was trying to instill hope in you. You have to believe that things can and will get better in order to be successful in therapy. Yes you can sit there and throw out evidence-based research on the prognosis of bipolar but that’s not the point. If you want someone more research and fact-based you would probably work better with a psychologist. If you are going to seek out another therapist then you should go on psychology today and look at each therapists’ treatment approach section. Research the terms you aren’t familiar with so you can get a better idea of how they will work with you."
GradSchool,fi60w1b,t3_f09u35,1582175508.0,Did it with a full-time job. Definitely only do part-time.
AskPsychiatry,fi5vk2d,t3_f6jsru,1582171545.0,Every therapist has a different style. Sounds like this one has a more cognitive approach (which assumes are maladaptive thoughts are the root cause of our emotions and behaviors). She may have been challenging your “negative” belief that you will always need meds and will never be capable of self-sufficiency. I very strongly doubt that she was being malicious or recommending that you go off of your meds. It was meant to be an empowering response and it’s totally okay if it rubbed you the wrong way. We all vibe differently with different people (therapists included) so it would be totally reasonable to seek out a different one. Sometimes it takes a few to find the right fit.

Lexapro has changed my life in so many positive ways, I’m scared to even think about where I would be now without it. But, I’ve gained 30+ lbs since I started taking it 3 years ago and last week I decided to cut my dose in half and start weaning off. 
I am active, eat nutritionally (most of the time) and have tried pretty much every diet out there/weight watchers/boot camps at gym, etc. but the weight keeps coming and I am over it. I’m a full time grad student with a full time job so yes I hit up Taco Bell every once in a while but not nearly enough to account for this. 
A few people have told me that counting calories is the only to lose weight on lexapro but honestly I don’t have time for that. 
Hopefully someone comes along with all the answers lol."

adderall,fhxnoxq,t3_f5bf3l,1581958404.0,Did you just get health insurance or started with a new one? The insurance company has to take extra steps to make sure the med is medically necessary before they can cover any part of the cost of a controlled substance (it’s basically to cover their asses from unnecessary spending). It’s also a benefit to you because you will be paying much less for the script than you were paying out of pocket. You won’t have to deal with prior auth if you continue to pay out of pocket. In my experience the process has taken no longer than a day and there was never an issue with the auth going through.

When you find yourself with thoughts you don’t like, just let them happen and accept it and love yourself regardless.

I am not a fan of dog parks at all. You can’t trust other dogs or their owners. My pup loves other dogs but I just can’t risk it. I used to take him to a dog park when I lived in an apartment complex that had a dog park so he played with the same dogs everyday, but going to a dog park where there’s unfamiliar dogs gives me insane anxiety. I took him to one a few times when I moved to my new town but there were some dogs that should have 100% not been there and the owners could have cared less. So now I just take him to doggy daycare a few times a month so he can socialize with familiar puppers and he plays with my neighbors pup almost everyday. 
Anyway, avoid dog parks and I hope that you can heal from this horrible experience. Many positive vibes going to you."
