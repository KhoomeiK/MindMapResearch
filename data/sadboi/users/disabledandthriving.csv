I'm so sorry your father is in a similar pair of shoes, I hope he can leave the hospital soon. Please let me know what your mom thinks and if you have any topic requests. I'm hoping to eventually touch on topics that relate to my circumstances that others want to learn about.

Thank you, I felt over editing would take away from everything. I want people to see how I am on different days/in different moods.

I'll keep the intro in mind for my future videos, I actually lost all of the current content when my computer took a dump. So, the greenhouse is part of my treatment plan, do you think I could do a video about why I'm featuring a greenhouse? Eventually I'd like to do videos about all the different things I try to do to stay healthy.

I tried a lot of ""alternative treatments"" over the years and unfortunately couldn't manage on my own anymore. Medication was sort of my last resort. I also worry about spreading misinformation potentially. I'll try to think more on how to go about that. Like the idea.

Thank you so much for taking the time to provide me with feedback, means the world to me. I hope your father feels better soon. Hope your family stays safe and healthy ü§ç"
