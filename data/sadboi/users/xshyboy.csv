intj,fnkc7oj,t1_fnka196,1587021720.0,"It’s not offensive, it’s ableist. It comes from 80 years of ableism that has seen autistic people as less. They were institutionalised until the 1980s because they were seen as such a burden. If you were to be diagnosed a doctor seeing you as high functioning may not allow you to get services that you require. If they saw you as low functioning they’d say you would struggle all your life and your parents wouldn’t even try to help you improve. Functioning labels are even used in mental hospitals where the higher functioning people are treated better than those with severe mental illness. 

Also those annoying Aspergians see themselves as superior for being high functioning. This is why functioning labels are awful. Autistic symptoms can be inconsistent and the same person who you’d think was high functioning could actually show symptoms that would be better suited for low functioning autistics. Most have a combination of symptoms covering the whole spectrum. I’m independent but I can have regressive behaviours that seem completely out of character for me. The HFA label makes my family take my symptoms less seriously until I make a video talking about how I can’t cope and that I’ve been constantly suicidal. So, there’s that. 

Even the medical community is considering getting rid of these labels. 

Maybe once you’re diagnosed and join the autistic community you’ll understand, until then you’re a neurotypical who’s basically telling an autistic person what should be offensive or not. And no I’m not offended by functioning labels, I just find them limiting and inaccurate."

But in saying that everyone saying or doing the same thing on social media annoys me. When people make a video just like another 5 videos it tells me originality is dead, or maybe certain people shouldn’t even bother being creative cause well they’re not. 

The panic buying and people defending panic buying really gets to me especially as I was one of the many affected by it.

People call it quarantine because they don’t know if they have the virus so staying at home kind of is like quarantine. I called it that while I was sick for a month.

I can’t even have a flat mate cause of all the communication issues that arise.
I no longer care what people think because most of them are judgemental a-holes that I’ll probably never see again. I’m more angry and impatient around people than anxious. It’s not not ideal but it’s better than being worried about them.
I’m probably the worst person to give advice because I’ve basically given up on ever having friends or a relationship. 

But people are just not worth worrying for  over and they all think it themselves. 

What helps me is actually being happy with who I am. I focus on thing like my creativity and curiosity. I’d never be cruel to someone unlike many out there. Idk I just find little things about myself that I should be proud about and not change, because people have always tried to change me to make me more socially acceptable. It’s funny, being more socially acceptable usually involves me being a worse version of myself. 

So my advice is just accept yourself how you are. If you keep trying to change to make other people like you you’ll never feel content. 

By the way, I practice my conversational skills with cashiers, postmen and retail workers. You just have to talk more to people to be able to get comfortable with it.

Also I have pathological demand avoidance syndrome (type of autism) and that basically dictates how I react to people. 

There’s are a lot of anti-intellectualism going on, which is people disbelieving the experts, so when people mock people for being less intelligent it’s usually due to their wilful ignorance. It’s still ableist and therefore discouraged to make fun of people who are less intelligent. 

Also, it feels like you’re not asking a question. You’ve already made your mind up. You even said ‘I’m correct.’ I used to be the same, and it’s pretty arrogant to assume you have all the answers without looking at the data. Isn’t it better to keep those feelings to yourself until you know for sure? And you can’t be sure without the answers. Also, you’re 17. Younger people are just more arrogant. Again, I’ve already been through that period in my life. I’m talking averages here. I know some 17 year olds who are actually pretty mature for their age. They’re pretty sweet open minded kids.

I remember I was at top form for part 1 of my IQ test then during the break my mum yelled at me and my performance plummeted during part 2. Also, as I have ADHD a simple pill could have raised my IQ score by 20 points. 

And the more you do IQ tests the better you get. Say you started out at 100 so you have enough skills to learn and memorise and learn from your mistakes. You could raise that higher with each attempt. Maybe not to genius level. It depends what questions you struggled with originally. The visual tasks might be harder to get better at than most of the math and verbal questions and general knowledge. Those just take memorisation. But the visual ones determine your thinking type. I scored highly on those because I’m a visual thinker. I suppose you could memorise that stuff too. 

And before anyone denies you can do that there was a prisoner who’s life was on the line and the only thing that would save him was doing well on an IQ test.

socialskills,fjccl38,t3_fchbub,1583215152.0,"I feel bad for the people who do this to me, cause my anxiety is too high to smile back. I’ve disappointed some pretty attractive people by not smiling back."
limerence,fjccdac,t3_fcjizq,1583214943.0,"I hope I’ve never given you the impression I was saying that. My limerence is milder than it was before, but I’ve had years to cope with being rejected. The second LO almost became an obsession but I never saw him again. I think I’m always going to struggle with it when I get interested in someone but for now I feel very little if it.

But I’d never try to tell someone to just let go of it. It took medical intervention just for me become totally disillusioned to my obsession with my LO. Everyone is on their own journey and will take longer to overcome it than others. It’s like with any mental illness that if someone overcomes it the way they did won’t work for someone with the same illness. So I respect that and only offer advice if it’s needed."

OCD,fjcbnwo,t1_fj5wanh,1583214292.0,"Yes, I’m not alone! I’ve heard a few things that have made me calm a bit. Coronavirus is mainly respiratory related so if you have a blocked/runny nose you’re probably don’t have it. I have a frustratingly blocked nose. Also the number of infected is quite low and only recently has it passed on from person to person. 
Anyway, tomorrow is day 5 of my illness which is when coronavirus goes into the lungs. If I can’t breathe I’ll call up my doctor’s surgery who will send people to get me tested. I’m kind of relaxed about that because I don’t have to find my own way there because of the quarantine. 

So o go through various stages of worry and not worry now, because looking at my symptoms and comparing them to coronavirus symptoms they don’t fit, but then part of me is going that one politician from Turkey wipes his nose and then he ended up with coronavirus. So yeah, I just don’t know.

I’ve been feeling awful for days. I just want it to end so I can get back to being productive. I had to force myself to clean my cat’s litter box and by the end I felt so exhausted. But it was so gross so had to be done. I haven’t been able to do any house cleaning. 

I never thought of how similar the symptoms would be for panic attacks. I suppose the difference is once you can calm down your breathing gets better. I do deep breathing exercises to calm down from panic attacks."
Screenwriting,fjbtgyp,t1_fjaeppd,1583201054.0,"Thanks. Yes, I’ve been watching movies and TV shows and putting it down as ‘research.’ Then I started to rewatch the entire Stargate franchise. It helped inspire me before so we’ll see what happens."

ADHD,fj0c20z,t3_faie7b,1582896095.0,"Ok so what you’re saying is people are saying you don’t have it as bad as people with hyperactive ADHD? Ok I get it on my very sleep deprived state. Some of us need stuff spelled out to us.

Yeah, ok, that sucks. Inattentive ADHD is my diagnosis but I’m more combined or I’m ADHD+bipolar so I’m less inattentive these days, 

Look, people just suck ok? They have their own preconceived notions which are often wrong and they stubbornly hold onto their ignorant views no matter how many factual articles you send them. 

Just ignore people. They dumb. Just because you don’t experience hyperactivity (btw many PH ADHD don’t- it becomes mental hyperactivity) doesn’t mean you don’t struggle in other ways."
Screenwriting,fj0bdyr,t1_fiyxg63,1582895544.0,"Did the Nazis actually believe that stuff?

It had something to do with this Yule club that started before WW2 and some of the members became high ranking members of The Third Reich."
Screenwriting,fj0am9h,t1_fixr3cr,1582894904.0,"That’s sucks. Those people are crazy cause LGBT films are so hot right now. Also, independent LGBT films are booming. I suppose it’s who you know that counts. I try to network with LGBT filmmakers all around the world. Mostly because I like their work. 
In the future I want to write about a trans character dating a gay male. It’s something you don’t see a lot in LGBT films."
autism,fj09jhj,t1_fiwjnkn,1582893972.0,"Look into the history. They were made for autistic people because deep pressure helps us sleep better. How long have you known about weighted blankets? I’ve known of them since one woman made these blankets for her own children. She put rice in them to give them weight. And they were expensive. Very few people could afford to buy them. I ended up using a heavy winter tiger blanket my dad had on the couch as a cover. It’s the only blanket that could help me sleep. I felt instantly calm under it. 

Also look into hug boxes. Temple Grandin made them for autistic kids with sensory sensitivities because it calms them. 

Normally things made for people with disabilities are marketed toward everyone so they get more people interested in them. More sales means more business. 

Anyone who can’t sleep from anxiety probably has an underlying anxiety disorder. Everyone had anxiety as a temporary emotion. Not everybody has an anxiety disorder. 

Yes, other people get something out of them but they were first marketed toward autistic children years and years before any neurotypical ever heard them of them."
socialskills,fj07dur,t3_fait8c,1582891930.0,"I went from saying very little to saying whatever came to my mind first which would sound stupid because like you I may not have understood everything, and I’d end up embarrassing myself. So now I really think about what to say. I still might say something a bit ignorant but it’s easier for me to shake off any embarrassing feeling, cause we all make mistakes. I’ve heard people, even on TV, say some truly dumb things. I heard Kate Blanchett say the most Boomer things. I was like oh cool, she’s a dork. How relatable. So everyone at times goes through this. You might just be going through it more."
introvert,fj071pd,t3_faqh0d,1582891579.0,"Most people talk to people purely to bond and build a connection, so it doesn’t matter what they talk about. They could be spouting gibberish but all that matters to them is that they said it and they were with someone.

For me and probably for you I care about the information they’re trying to get across rather than just the fact that they’re speaking. I see myself as someone who likes to learn and educate, not as someone who just says beep beep bloop while I spend time with someone. 

I don’t know if I’m at all close to describing your situation but I see there’s two things we can get out of socialising with someone: just enjoying someone’s company while talking about absolutely useless things or giving and receiving information. I know I’m the latter. 

Also, keep in mind some people might just be bad at explaining things."
science,fj06f42,t1_fj040p7,1582890905.0,"I was only aware of research that said people with ADHD couldn’t regulate emotions, not that they feel them more raw. That’s interesting. One theory of autism is The Intense World syndrome which says autistic people feel too much and feel it intensely, so much so that it overwhelms them so they appear to not feel much because of a lack of expression or reaction, but really it’s just because their feelings just sort of lock them up. People with BPD feelings are often irrational and uncontrollable. Bipolar is about extreme highs and lows. During highs or mania they experience high anxiety and basically all their emotions are amplified. Happy becomes euphoria. Angry becomes rage. Mania basically makes you feel like you’re on speed. 

So I have all of this happening in one brain. So my intense emotions could be from any one of them, including ADHD."
aspergers,fizvbre,t1_fiwsxdo,1582876245.0,"I relate to that a lot. I couldn’t read an analog clock until I was 16 and didn’t learn it fluently until I was in my mid 20s. By then digital took over. But I mastered it just so I knew I could.
I can’t read music to save myself. But with a high amount of Ritalin that’s too dangerous for me now I can learn to read it and play a musical instrument. I’m just rotten at reading symbols. 
I know I’m a visual thinker and teachers don’t really teach to that style. Well they didn’t in the 90s. 

I have dyslexia, dyspraxia and dysgraphia so I probably have some dyscalculia. Strange that it’s less of a problem on Ritalin. I can’t take it anymore because of severe side effects so I struggle quite a lot with math, reading music, pretty much everything you listed."
aspiememes,fizuocx,t1_fixm7wj,1582875453.0,I like to help people but if they won’t listen then all my efforts seem futile and that could even trigger my depression. I got to take care of me first so I can continue giving advice to people who need it.
science,fizu77a,t1_fizsr8q,1582874868.0,"I’m unmedicated and ditto. I feel emotions strong enough because of autism, bipolar and picking up some BPD symptoms from my mum, so I get distraught by things that happened years ago.

But as someone with severe OCD, it kind of does. And as I don’t completely relate I thought I’d share my thoughts as others have.

Is there any other part of my post you’d like me to explain?"
science,fiza5xy,t1_fiz8ozs,1582857772.0,Even. I started flicking on/off light switches like that but was able to stop. I don’t do many rituals. I’m more your intrusive thoughts obsessive hand washing crying in the foetal position over a messy/ contaminated room type OCD.

science,fiz96jc,t1_fiyoxkj,1582857110.0,"This is me too. It’s why CBT can backfire on me. My anxiety combined with memories of things going bad, especially bad enough to cause me PTSD, can pretty much cancel out any CBT progress."
science,fiz90xo,t1_fiz5ahr,1582857005.0,"Hard same. I’m always stressed or uncomfortable in my dreams. My nightmares affect me emotionally for hours afterwards. I still think of one where I’m basically raped, which was almost a decade ago. 

When I do remember my dreams they have been vivid and I often wake up exhausted from them. I actually named one from a decade ago ‘Social Storms’ because I moved into a very social house and I’m autistic and I had pressure on me to socialise more and I was getting so exhausted I collapse from it. Then I had dreams that these groups of people were tornadoes. I wrote a blog about it and everything. 

I used to have dreams about drowning as a kid around the time most kids get swimming lessons. I was so fearful I always refused swimming lessons. To this day I still have a fear of water. 

My intrusive thoughts are often violent and sexual and they follow me into my dreams. I have the most horrid dreams about my cat. Not sexual, violent. They disturb me so much when I wake up I have to find and hug my cat."
science,fiz8bny,t1_fiz151x,1582856537.0,"I’m often anxious or uncomfortable in my dreams. Last dream I had my late father was trying to convert me to Catholicism and my mother was fighting against it because she’s a devout Pentecostal. One, irl my dad rejected religion. Two, I go out of my way to avoid any type of Christianity because I’m still scarred from growing up in a Pentecostal church. I was pretty tense in my dream, and it was constantly dark. I woke up like WTF? 

A reoccurring dream I have is when I can’t speak properly. I have a speech impediment enough as it is when I’m awake. 

I have a lot of hypnagogic hallucinations too. You know, you’re about to nod off but you hear a voice, feel a presence. It got so bad that I tried to stop myself from sleeping. Or there’s the ones you get when you’re half asleep half awake and I’m usually being murdered. 

I’m not sure if what you’re trying to say is we (with OCD) are under or over prepared to deal with dangerous situations. 

Anyway, I thought dreaming was our brain working a lower capacity and trying to make sense of your thoughts. That’s why they seem real but have some scientific errors on them. Mine do at least. I have a lot of dreams about meteor strikes (destroying the Earth), the Moon, shooting stars and the science is slightly off. I’m like nice try brain, a C for effort."
science,fiz70t0,t1_fiz2hya,1582855659.0,"Problem is if previous experiences were so bad that led to the OCD, then CBT can do very little, as it’s ingrained in you that things could go bad because they did before. I for one am grateful my anxiety helps warn me of dangers. I hear so many people not even considering the possibly of something going wrong and well they’re left with trying to solve the situation that could have been easily avoided. Although having less panic attacks does sound good."
