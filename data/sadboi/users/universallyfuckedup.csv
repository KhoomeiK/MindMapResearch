Anxiety,fdj41ha,t3_elm4sm,1578457869.0,Yes I‚Äôve been trying not to read the news but it‚Äôs just everywhere. My sister is over in the Middle East and I just want her to come home but at the same time I‚Äôm afraid for her to get on a plane. I‚Äôm really trying not to think about it and get myself worked up.
CrohnsDisease,faa4519,t3_e847vi,1575901692.0,You look amazing! So happy for you! What are the majority of your Crohn‚Äôs symptoms? Right now I have a lot of problems with abscesses and fistulas and remicade at 600mg every 6 weeks just doesn‚Äôt seem to be cutting it.
JustNoSO,f9wsd5d,t3_e785y7,1575697984.0,I read through your old posts. You are so brave. I wish you nothing but healing during this difficult time. This is the beginning of a new life for you. You deserve a good life where you feel safe and loved. I know it‚Äôs probably so unimaginably hard right now but it will be worth it when you‚Äôre free from this horrible man.
Metalcore,f9v23pf,t1_f6zv1wg,1575661783.0,Thank you! You‚Äôre the best friend I‚Äôve always wanted.
relationship_advice,f9t44sn,t3_e6mcu3,1575608198.0,Ask your sister for a condom and see if it‚Äôs the same one that was found in the trash can . If it‚Äôs the same wrapper than I‚Äôd say they fucked.
AnxietyDepression,f9ruo0f,t1_f9ro4b2,1575581537.0,I‚Äôm 27. I feel like it only gets harder getting older because now people think you should have grown out anxiety by now- which is ridiculous.
relationship_advice,f9ruc13,t3_e35vj6,1575581407.0,"Wow. I‚Äôm honestly in awe of you. There‚Äôs not many guys I‚Äôve ever heard of to be so mature in a situation like this. She will really regret what she did one day because from what you typed you seem like a really good hearted man. I can‚Äôt imagine how crushing this is for you and the fact you can handle it all with such humility and insight is something you don‚Äôt see very often in people. Down the line when you heal from this I know you will be in the happy, faithful relationship you deserve.  I just happy that you found out what kind of person she was before you married her. Not many people get that and good for you for standing up for yourself and walking away."
AnxietyDepression,f9ro01r,t3_e6mq6j,1575578925.0,"I totally get it. I always feel so embarrassed I have anxiety and I try to cover it up. Everyday things are hard for me and it definitely makes me feel ashamed, so it‚Äôs hard for me to get close to people outside my family. how old are you?"
Marriage,f9r4786,t3_e6begf,1575571017.0,I‚Äôm really trying not to tear up at the gym right now. That is so beautiful and the kind of love everyone wants.

rant,f9nrj0k,t1_f9norvd,1575489478.0,Okay? You‚Äôre lucky you work with guys who respect you. Not everyone is that lucky and they have to fight everyday to prove they deserve respect. Don‚Äôt blame her like it‚Äôs her fault people discriminate and disrespect her.
self,f9nhfri,t3_e5xmlp,1575484569.0,"I wish everyone felt this way. I‚Äôve been trying accept my bare natural face. It‚Äôs very hard in a society where everyone get injections, has perfect skin and looks like a Barbie doll."

rant,f9ngleg,t1_f9nep3p,1575484111.0,How can you make a statement about how she carries herself? You don‚Äôt even know her. Maybe it‚Äôs just circumstances and you‚Äôve been lucky not to work for people who look down on you for being a women.
relationship_advice,f9kf9i0,t3_e5a4p5,1575399220.0,This is so horrific and I‚Äôm so sorry he is doing this to you and put you in this situation. I have no advice to add but I wanted to let you know you are very brave in taking the steps to bring this monster to justice and prevent him from hurting other kids. I don‚Äôt know you but I‚Äôm proud of you‚ù§Ô∏è

JustNoSO,f9gqej8,t3_e50brs,1575303230.0,"Wow. I am so sorry this is happening to you. I wish I had some more helpful advice besides LEAVE but I know that is hard with small children, especially while being pregnant. Have you confronted him about it yet?"
Skincare_Addiction,f9f05en,t3_e4rp1s,1575256092.0,"I would try to simplify your routine. Take a break from salicylic acid and try a gentle cleanser and moisturizer. Seems like you may be doing too much and aggravating your skin further. I would only you exfoliating acids a couple times a week. I really like dermalogica special cleansing gel. And I use makeup eraser to remove makeup at night and follow with the gentle cleanser. 

I want to try dermalogica active moist moisturizer but haven‚Äôt had he money to buy it yet. But seems like a lot of their products work on acne prone skin."
Anxiety,f9c7t06,t3_e4fv0z,1575220156.0,I‚Äôm the same way! Driving always triggers anxiety for me. I‚Äôm ok driving very short distances to places I know. But since my car has been out of commission I haven‚Äôt been behind the wheel for a couple months so anxious when o do start driving again.
RBNSpouses,f9bzfya,t3_e3rha3,1575217859.0,Thank you for all the responses. I‚Äôm kind of overwhelmed with all the info and still processing it. I don‚Äôt like to call this abuse even though according to people it is. I guess I think of it as him just being a self absorbed asshole when he acts like this. I really don‚Äôt want to give up on our relationship and our family. When we do fight and he says demeaning things I assure my son that is not the proper way to act and even though we‚Äôre adults we still make mistakes and that‚Äôs why I am showing him the healthy ways to respond to stress and conflict. I never want my son to think it okay to mistreat people no matter how sad or mad he feels inside.
relationship_advice,f9bvddp,t3_e4eiez,1575216669.0,"This comment is from a person who clearly doesn‚Äôt have a child. If this were my son, I would burn the whole world down to save him."
RBNSpouses,f9bnh29,t1_f9ae8vb,1575214414.0,This made me laugh haha. But yes he can definitely be that way sometimes.
Life,f9bnads,t3_e2vbm8,1575214342.0,"I totally relate to this on so many levels and have felt this way my whole life. Literally since I can remember. You are definitely not alone. I do have a significant other and our son, so they make my life worth living. But anxiety and medical issues has definitely stoped me from pursuing a career and making connections with people besides my family. I always have felt like I‚Äôm not where I‚Äôm supposed to be in life and I‚Äôm abnormal. I‚Äôm trying to work on changing my perspective but It has been a very difficult journey."
Skincare_Addiction,f96svxq,t3_e3ye9o,1575151228.0,"Awe I‚Äôm so sorry. I understand what a mental toll that can have. In my teens I had pretty good skin then throughout my 20s I‚Äôve have severe breakouts that made me never want to look in the mirror. It took months to heal my skin. I do still get some pimples but nothing like a couple years ago when my face was covered. It‚Äôs a lot of trial and error figuring out what products work and which ones don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm still figuring it out but my skin has been in a pretty decent place in terms of acne. 

Tips. Use a gentle cleanser. More acne fighting ingredients can sometimes agitate skin. 

Don‚Äôt use a scrub I notice those can really worsen acne. 

Exfoliate with a chemical exfoliating I like ones with AHAs and glycolic acid and no one than 2-3 times a week. 

I try to limit any moisturizer and cleansers that has harsh fragrances.   

If you have the financial means try out dermalogica products. I love their special cleansing gel. 

Right now I‚Äôm kind of in between products because I haven‚Äôt had the financial means but when I get the money I‚Äôm going to try out the whole dermalogica line for my routine. 

What products are you using now and what‚Äôs your routine like?"
Marriage,f96rehw,t3_e3yjrc,1575150564.0,Awe this made me tear up. You are very lucky. Sometimes life doesn‚Äôt hand us the easiest path but it makes you feel like you can make it when you have someone by your side loving you unconditionally and supporting you.
RBNSpouses,f95sdju,t3_e3rha3,1575134423.0,"I think I know in my gut what he is. It‚Äôs just hard to accept that the person I love makes me feel this way. I have glimpses of him that seems accepting and good hearted but most of the time he just seems so angry, judgmental and demeaning. He‚Äôs really good at convincing me that I‚Äôm in the wrong and I‚Äôm abnormal. I can‚Äôt just leave because he‚Äôs the father of my son. And right now I only have a small income and a chronic illness that prevents me from working. Along with anxiety I need to address but it‚Äôs so hard to work on myself when I‚Äôm this draining relationship. I know I need to be strong and figure it out to make my life better but I don‚Äôt even know where to start because I‚Äôm so dependent on him."
JustNoSO,f95q9w5,t3_e37yqv,1575133190.0,"I read your new and old post and wow I am so happy for you. You really overcame so much and you should be so proud. You deserve all the good you built for yourself and all the good coming your way. 

I have to say your old post gives me anxiety though. My husband reminds me so much of your ex. Where can lie so easily about everything big to small and has been on dating sites and cheated on me on emotional terms, not sure if sexual multiple times. And he manipulates me emotionally and makes me feel like I‚Äôm in the wrong. 

I probably should leave but the problem is we have a 6 year old son and my son has expressed he would be so upset if we ever separated and I have a chronic illness that doesn‚Äôt allow me to work right now along with horrible anxiety- so I‚Äôm not Independent at all. Besides some income I get which isn‚Äôt much. I just really admire you for pulling yourself out of such a mind fuck of a relationship and coming out the other side!"
offmychest,f94qhmu,t1_f94q3jo,1575098447.0,Xoxo sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm the only one.

relationship_advice,f94otra,t3_e3petj,1575096273.0,"I mean that‚Äôs great she‚Äôs independent women and everything but I just see it as someone trying to make life harder than it needs to be. Why not just enjoy the trip together. You have the money, it‚Äôs a nice gesture. Why fuss? I guess she has her own reasons but I think it was sweet and thoughtful for you to do that. She‚Äôs lucky to have someone like you that cares enough to go out of their way like that and plan a trip together."
CrohnsDisease,f94gy8n,t3_e3j4su,1575087949.0,"You‚Äôre not alone. And things will get better.

socialskills,f94glpn,t3_e3pzql,1575087623.0,"I needed to hear this. I have the same confidence issues. I‚Äôm always feeling ashamed because I‚Äôm not where i think I should be in life so although I‚Äôm friendly and say hi to people I can never really open up and show people who I am. 

I need to work on being open and let go a little."
deadbedroom,f93kkwh,t1_f93ixeb,1575061397.0,I really don‚Äôt think he does by the way he acts towards me most of the time. What do you suggest I do?
offmychest,f9342pv,t3_e37wwf,1575049365.0,I am so incredibly sorry for what you dad is going through. I know the cruelty of cancer. My step dad does of pancreatic cancer 3 years ago. And I know how hard it is to watch someone you love fight for their life. I‚Äôm thinking about you and you family. I‚Äôm hoping for a miracle xoxo
deadbedroom,f92zups,t3_e3ar40,1575046238.0,Thank you I will give that a try. Unfortunately a lot of my issues come from perianal issues so I don‚Äôt know how much diet affects that. But I‚Äôll give it a try.
CrohnsDisease,f92zh0j,t3_e3b7e6,1575045952.0,Thank you for sharing. I will try your advice. I try to explain to him without getting too much into specifics. But sometimes I think when he‚Äôs sexually frustrated he can‚Äôt even control his discontent with me. Idk. I‚Äôll keep on trying to not take it personally and letting the fact I don‚Äôt have a normal body get to me. But it‚Äôs definitely difficult. I know I have a lot mentally to overcome.
deadbedroom,f92y1tk,t3_e3ar40,1575044875.0,Thank you! I‚Äôm definitely trying to communicate although it‚Äôs my second nature to withdrawal. But I also don‚Äôt want to be too confrontational. But with him sometimes he takes things the wrong way even when I‚Äôm trying to be delicate.
CrohnsDisease,f92xxm6,t1_f92fhyp,1575044787.0,Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. From suffering from this disease since child hood. I always have a love and understanding for anyone dealing with a chronic illness. We have to stick together.
CrohnsDisease,f92xtmf,t3_e3b7e6,1575044703.0,Yeah he can definitely be a dick sometimes. I‚Äôm glad you have such a supportive husband and family. I bet going through that had to be very difficult. I hope you‚Äôre doing well. Thank you for the well wishes!
deadbedroom,f92xp9b,t3_e3ar40,1575044610.0,"Thank you for the advice. I will look into that book. I try to be understanding but there‚Äôs been times in the past where he was on dating sites looking to connect with someone else, so that broke my heart. 

He says he just did it to see if women still wanted him but it just made me feel he took the easy way out instead of working on our relationship he‚Äôs looking for something with someone else. 

I try to be secure in our relationship but the coldness towards me especially when we‚Äôre not having sex makes me feel self conscious. 

We‚Äôre having money problems too so that doesn‚Äôt help either."
CrohnsDisease,f92x569,t1_f92txid,1575044179.0,"Thank you. Yes you understand perfectly. Looking at me people wouldn‚Äôt know how much pain and discomfort I‚Äôm in. I try not to be negative and really look at the good side of things. But last night I just broke and cried harder than I have in a long time. I don‚Äôt work as of now but still try to workout and keep up with house chores, walking our dog, taking care of our son etc. although lately I feel so drained and uncomfortable but nothing I do ever seems good enough to my husband. Grieving the life and sex life I thought I‚Äôd have definitely is something I‚Äôve been doing. But that is good idea looking up creative ways to be more sexual. I know a lot of it is in my head too and I need to get over mental obstacles so I won‚Äôt just blame it all on my husband. 

I think what he doesn‚Äôt realize is the mental toll having issues with my anal and vaginal area have on me. Especially in my 20s. It makes me feel less than a women but I know it‚Äôs something I need to get over. But having a more outwardly loving and supportive partner would help."
deadbedroom,f92uhe4,t1_f92pnrt,1575042106.0,We in our late 20‚Äôs. He does watch porn but that‚Äôs not the problem. I don‚Äôt mind he watches it. The affection problem most likely comes from the fact his parents were never affectionate with him as a child and I try to be understanding of that. But what annoys me is he acted affectionate when we were first together to win me over I guess. Now that we‚Äôve been together he thinks he shouldn‚Äôt have to be that way anymore because I should just know he loves me.
