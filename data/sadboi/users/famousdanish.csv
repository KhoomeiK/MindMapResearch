Depression just sucks out the fight, the motivation. Anhedonia is one term that describes these symptoms.

For me, when I'm depressed, someone trying to force me to do something would make me recoil more. So, I can only say, don't try to change her. Maybe you could softly suggest seeing a therapist or starting medicine, if she has not tried these paths.

Another idea: suggest going for a walk? And when you walk just try to be there for her, doesn't even matter if you twi don't talk or discuss her depression. Just be a support, be there.

Also, time heals. For me, I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so my depressive episodes have always lifted, just months or even a year later. Even if your sister isn't bipolar, I had a therapist who said ""depression always lifts"". Depression is episodic, even if it's chronic.

For probably better, tested ways of help, I'd recommend looking into family support books for depression.

I gotta be realistic since this is a chronic disease, but I also wanna have hope, not despair.

I feel like these ""drop"" periods are the most critical period. Here, I can either tread water or let myself sink. Treading water for me is: behavioral activation, continuing therapy/medication, following a routine, building and maintaining social supports, sobriety, and more.

If you think your only option is suicide, taking a giant step backward with whatever else and taking a giant step toward professional help is my suggestion. I suggest googling your local crisis center and calling them asking for options. 

Locked door inpatient can be intense but maybe you simply need some time for all these feelings, thoughts, and problems to blow over. Maybe individual therapy would help give you perspective. Maybe an intensive outpatient or a partial program would get you some gains.

You're 22. You're calling the game way too early. This isn't the end. This could even be the beginning to an even better chapter. It's impossible to know.

I'm 30, and I've had many times where I too thought, this is it. I'm ruined. Then life just kept moving, things changed, life evolved.

I've learned a lot since 22: how to talk to people, how to find better support, how not to listen to my emotions and my stinkin'thoughts, how to practice gratitude.

You too, I bet, in the next 8 years will learn a lot. Even just thru osmosis, not thru brute force.

Keep ya chin up. Get out of your head today using whatever means, watching a movie, reading, blasting that favorite record.

You into DBT? That's helped me in my last chapter. You might get something out of improving your distress tolerance, recognizing your distress, and taking gentle (not brute force) action."

I thought it would be worse. I find it more difficult to wake up, but I'm also not sure if that's because I started nicotine and caffeine again.

I'm on 10 mg and I honestly feel pretty normal. My manic euphoria is gone, which is good, cause I was so emotionally raw. My paranoia (ideas of reference, delusions of persecution) has also evaporated.

I feel relatively normal today. Also, I haven't gained a lot of weight, I think because I've been actively avoiding added sugars. Give me a donut, and I'll freaking eat a dozen. But if I stay away from sugar to begin with, I find I am ok."
depression,fhqrhtv,t1_fhqp7si,1581809727.0,"For sure. I'm not sure you need a psychiatrist's diagnosis solely. I'm pretty sure a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) can also diagnose you. Often therapists are LCSWs, so if your center has any, see if you can see one of them, perhaps. I believe even a Primary Care Physician (PCP), like a family doctor, could even diagnose you.

I also think I've been diagnosed just during my intake, so I wonder if you may already have a formal diagnosis.

I say all this because, at least in my area, wait times to see a psychiatrist out-patient can often be a month, or even longer.

Having that formal diagnosis paperwork will probably be required for your HR to give any accomodations, so I think you're on the right track.

In one instance, I was able to take time off and actually receive short term disability. That was an awesome HR at that company, since I had only been there for 4 months 

I also left my last job due to my depression and anxiety. I tried to collect unemployment but the state wouldn't let me because I didn't say anything to HR to have them accommodate me. So telling HR might help in case you eventually need unemployment money.

Of course, others may say self-disclosure of mental illness could hurt you. I really think if you just keep this rapport between you and HR, you'll avoid stigma.

You probably are not unique. Like all the other people, fat or skinny, you can find a relationship, too. 

As adults, it's freaking a hard reality that we have to surround ourselves with people by our own doing. There's little built-in community in modern society.

I think we have to learn: the world/people are not going to come to us. We need to go out into the world to find the people we value.

Since then, things have gotten better. I had to take some steps back to potentially move ahead. I had to move back in with family. I had to have a talk I didn't want to have with my roommate and landlord and find a way to leave. I had to default on my debt.

Getting into treatment has been the best, for me. That is help. A local mental health hub can point you to resources and greater support. Also, some spirituality has helped me with faith, faith that I can grow through these struggles and maybe even come out stronger.

I wish you the best in your pickle. Many have had job issues, rent issues, bankruptcies, extreme loss, and came thru to the other side. Even though you feel alone, others have walked your steps.

One purpose that has helped me has been to help others. Like, get out of my own self-absorbed head and focus on someone the fuck else for an hour.

Another purpose I have is just make it to the finish line, say I fucking did it, I did life. Yeah, I'm not perfect and my life and mind can suck.

Sounds like you are making some small steps, such as going out to stores. Maybe another small step is answering that friend's phone call. You could just shoot the shit with your friend, try to have have fun, you don't need to go really deep about your depression, at least not for too long.

I, too, smoke cigarettes and abuse alcohol when I get really depressed. Eight years is a long time, I can see how breaking that would be disappointing. Cigarettes I feel are less harmful short-term than alcohol, in my opinion, though. Of course, the alcohol makes me forget my depression for a couple hours, but fucks with my sleep and my hangovers suck.

Try not to blame yourself. You're right, we pretty much do put ourselves in our depression hole I think. But now is the time to be kind to yourself, not accusing, like how you would be kind to a sick friend or family member. Is there a healthy gift you could give yourself to ease yourself?

My advice/insight would be to continue your therapy. Try to be as open with your therapist as you can be, say the shit you didn't think you would ever talk about. If you don't have anything to say, talk about that. 

Beyond therapy, are there any old friends you can call or text? An aunt who maybe cared about you? A cousin? Even if it's years, is there anyone you have to could make plans with, or just catch up a lil over text?

Beyond that, can you just get out, go to a coffee shop and just a read a newspaper, and be around the buzz of people? I think just being around people can be medicine for our brains.

2) You have asked for help. Great! Not everyone does. Okay, I will offer some suggestions. Do you want to kill yourself? No? Great, then read the next paragraph. Yes? Okay, no problem. Google your nearest crisis center, find their direct phone number, and call them, briefly explaining you are suicidal and how they would recommend you proceed.

3) Okay, so you're freaking depressed as shit but you still know you want to fucking try, as hard as it fucking is, to lift yourself up. Okay, then: have you tried therapy? If no, that's your fucking only mission right now. Get yourself to a therapist.

4) You have tried therapy? Okay, howabout trying a different therapist? Have you tried group therapy? Have you tried other therapeutic models such as CBT, DBT, internal family systems, REBT, psychodynamics? Yes? Well, have you REALLY tried them? Can you try therapy a lil harder?

5) Finally, do you have any spirituality? Can you talk to a god, or a deceased loving relative, or the freaking universe and just share your pain with them? Fuck, this world is so freaking wild there's gotta be something behind it all. Can you believe that? That this world is wild and we may be here for a reason? And your struggles might be worth it, your struggles might be how you will grow like you want to? Talk to the universe, and keep talking to the universe.
