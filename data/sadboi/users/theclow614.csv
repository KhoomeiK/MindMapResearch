A cleanse of sorts does seem necessary though! Decent suggestion."
Empaths,fjad8wx,t3_fc7xgd,1583171123.0,"I was 14 dating a very mentally and emotionally unwell 22 year old. For a year and a half I tried to fix him. It sounds ridiculous and the whole experience was. I was fixated on him and had to coach him to be ""complete"" in some way. Waaaay too much for a 14 yr old to handle, way beyond my mental capacity and it drained me. I swear it took years off my life. And he would project his three attempted suicides on me until I was 16. I still feel his feelings today as I, myself, am 22. Miles and miles away. 

I was in denial the whole time. Until a therapist relayed it to me. I had to fundamentally change the way I percieve the world."

relationships,fdh3r0s,t3_eld2cw,1578414737.0,"Call the suicide hotline. Go to the hospital immediately and say you are having these thoughts. They will treat you, give you options, give you the OPPORTUNITY to continue. It's a rough time. I've been in a similar spot. Your foggy mindset keeps you from seeing that you loved and important.
Do not kill yourself. Seek help. You can turn this around. Best of luck. Do not give up!"
