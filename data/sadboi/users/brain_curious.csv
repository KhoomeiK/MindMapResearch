Perhaps it actually helped at some point; I was sure it did but in retrospect it's not clear. It did become clear that it began to trigger hypomanic and/or depressive symptoms, particularly as I smoked less and became more sensitive to it.

Cannabis & concentrates used to seem like it worked for me (daily smoker 12 years) - and I had success in the normal societal sense. 2 undergrad degrees, masters, good paying stable corporate job, bought a house. After a manic episode in my early 30’s, my response changed. Experimenting with my reactions to it (like I do for food, supplements, etc) helped me figure out what’s best for me, which is not to use THC for the foreseeable future. CBD (0% THC) every day for me tho.

The only advice I can suggest for everyone across the board is to experiment when there’s a question with their habits, and be present and honest with how your body and brain responds. I believe that sobriety in bp helps most people, but there’s tons of variables and situational contexts."
BipolarReddit,fpoj09i,t3_ge55o4,1588785310.0,"No. Not anymore. For a long time, maybe 10 years, I would have said yes. I choose to accept it and find what I can appreciate about it, instead of feeding the emotions of resentment, regret, shame etc. (edit) I make a point to lean into whatever emotion I’m feeling - I don’t believe any emotion is inherently good or bad - but there are some (love, joy, gratitude) I choose to encourage.

It’s shown me just about the widest range of human emotions possible, and because I believe I’m here to experience the full experience of life, I can see how this fits in what I was looking for from a young age.

It’s part of my life purpose. Could I have a different life purpose if I didn’t have this diagnosis? Sure. But I choose to believe that I’m here partly to help others with it - a huge problem, society-disease-burden wise. Which means it’s a great opportunity to work on.

I still have dark days, and unstable feelings in elevated moods, along with anxiety or other cognitive symptoms. But it all comes and passes like the tide, if I choose to see it that way. I work *really* hard and it’s taken me a lot of work to get here.

BipolarReddit,fphbifa,t3_gcrsy7,1588618330.0,"Agreed on the above. For me, some nuances:

\- Sobriety. I did not want to hear that shit the first 12 years after my Dx. But it's super important for me. Over a year without cannabis, and next week will be a year without alcohol. Wish I did those sooner.

\- Diet - highly suggest experimenting to see what's best for each person. For me, sugar is addictive (as it is for many people) and a few days of sugar binging can trigger episodes for me. Gluten makes me have a full autoimmune reaction for a couple days - I'm not diagnosed celiac, but I have a history of TBI, which makes gluten sensitivity more likely.

I do best on a zerocarb / ketogenic diet. I've experimented for 4+ years with gluten free, dairy free, paleo, low FODMAP, paleo ketogenic, and zerocarb / carnivore. Ketogenic seems to be the most important thing - I take lamotrigene, also used for seizures; keto has been used for drug-resistant seizures for 100+ years; going keto helped me taper off my antipsychotic and reduce my mood stabilizer dose.

\- yoga, meditation, presence practices. Hot yoga is the best for me; helps me level out whether mood is up or down or anxious or anything.

\- transformational breathwork - 1-1.5 hour sessions that can facilitate a very gentle altered state, where my body is able to process emotions that I had bottled up for years. Re-birthing, soulful breathwork, things like that. Holotropic is similar but generally contraindicated for bp because of the possibility to trigger manic states.

\- therapy, emotional processing, trauma work. These are the big-pictures ways I heal - working through the emotional triggers that can set off, or are associated with mood episodes. Being more tuned into my body, mind, and emotional state makes it easy to catch symptoms early on, and ""sanding down the trigger button"" means I don't go through the ups and downs as often, or to as significant a degree.

\- not identifying with my emotions or mood. ""I'm having this experience of feeling..."" instead of ""I am..."" Makes it way easier to see feelings as tides coming in or out, and my job is to ride the waves, not to always feel a certain way.

\- neurofeedback, neurostim. Recommend a place that will start with a brain scan and not attempting DIY. Alpha-stim has been really helpful for anxiety for me, and some depression. Infrared (photobiomodulation) helps with sleep, but bigger picture promotes neurogenesis and healing. Electrical or magnetic stim can help too.

\- constantly seeing my life as an experiment. Helps to maintain curiosity instead of self-judgement, and I keep finding ways that work better for me.

\- my bp support group. There's no replacement for being in a place where everyone ""gets me"" and there's no judgement for symptoms, crazy shit, etc. It feels good to be heard and seen, and also it feels good to provide my experience when it can help other people.

\- next up for me: aligning my career with life purpose to help others with similar conditions."

A ramping up prescription also played a part in triggering my first hypomanic episode, and even when the dose was stabilized, it hurt my sleep, and made me feel jittery, probably contributed to anxiety. But it felt worth it to get through college and my first professional job. 

I started EEG neurofeedback, believing it could help my ADHD symptoms but very skeptical that it could help me get off stimulants, as the psychiatrist said it could. About 10 hours of video-game like training with an electrode on my head, and I realized I hadn't refilled my prescription. I could pay better attention without adderall than I used to be able to while taking it. I haven't taken it in over 10 years. Been through some more neurofeedback, though :)

I now see ADHD symptoms as part of my bp symptoms, not something separate. If I get off track with my routines (sleep, exercise, eating, etc) my attention gets worse. The bp management certainly takes priority for me because when that's settled, everything else is better including attention."
Enneagram,fnac8r9,t3_g07lv0,1586794947.0,"Sure!

It sounds like you're referring to wings and not subtypes\* here - more info at the bottom. If you have access to using both wings - in my world that's great! A teacher of mine (Ben Saltzman) says what I believe is a true (although sort of corny) statement - ""use both wings to fly.""

My intent with working with the enneagram is to have access to the high sides of all the types whenever that's what the situation calls for. My personal bias is to look at one's enneatype as like the hour hand on a clock - for some people it points closer to the primary type, for others, it leans more toward a wing. So perhaps you're pretty close to being ""in the middle"" of 5, but can go toward both wings when they serve you. In my world, more flexibility and adaptation, and less reliance on fewer patterns is a good thing.

&#x200B;

\*Subtypes are the self-pres / social / 1:1 (sexual) instincts. These do show up in ""stacks,"" that is the order in which you tend to rely on them. For instance, I'm a self-pres / 1:1 / social stack, so I lean toward self-pres most, 1:1 when those needs feel met, and social has tended to be more of a blind spot. So, in a way those are mixed, usually showing up in different proportions. I've put intention around working with my social aspects and it's helped me develop a supportive community - authentic relating crowds, where almost everyone seems to work with the enneagram :)"
BipolarReddit,fnaa5i9,t3_g01e87,1586793867.0,"Yes, I'm on 150mg lamotrigene, as my only Rx. Been on lamotrigene nearly 13 years, with a combined 1.5 - 3 years during that time also on Abilify (2007 - 2009, started alongside lamical, then about 9 months 2018 - 2019 following a mushroom trip-induced manic episode). 

My last round with Abilify got some serious side effects, and it took me 6 months to safely taper off of it. 

I generally like it - fewer side effects than other meds I've tried. It doesn't prevent me from feeling depressive, but those blips usually come for a day or two at a time. I've felt 1-3 days of hypomania but they are self limiting. 

My suggestion would be to be really careful / consistent with as many other things as you can in life. I've been eating keto the last 15 months, and the last time I felt any real instability was after a week or so off-diet last fall. Zerocarb seems to be the best for me. I'm careful about sleep. 100% sober helps a bunch too. I was able to get by on lamotrigene monotherapy while smoking weed / drinking but I would NOT recommend using substances. 

I'd also try to be really conscious of how you're feeling coming off Zyprexa. Most docs / prescribers have no real sense of what a safe taper is like. Some people can quit cold turkey and be ok, some can go over a period of weeks, others may take months or a year+. There's too many factors at play to really predict, but the more in touch you are with your body and how you're feeling, the safer you'll be."

BipolarReddit,flf622b,t3_focbqh,1585098856.0,"The line between cyclothymia, bp2, bp1 are fuzzy and a spectrum that people can move on. It was 10 years between my bp2 Dx and my first real manic episode. 

SSRIs, especially without a mood stabilizer and/or antipsychotic, can be dangerous on the bipolar spectrum. Maybe not for everyone, but they do have a chance of triggering a hypo-to-manic episode. 

Side effects are individualized and can change over time. That said, antipsychotics are more infamous for side effects than many of the newer mood stabilizers, especially the longer term problems like tardive dyskinesia. But mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants can also cause long term problems, depending on the person. 

My personal bias is toward TMS. It's nothing like ECT and can really help people. I acknowledge it can be expensive, but if I were in your position that's what I would aim for. I wonder how many meds you'd have to try before insurance would cover it? I'd still want to be really careful trying new meds just to check the box before TMS. 

\*If\* you were to try SSRIs, I would recommend having a really clearly defined check in plan for the first week especially. Like talking to a supportive person who knows you well and can also be really direct with you...every few hours. Not exaggerating - I would hope for a handful of times a day where you actually talk on the phone or video and they can hear your voice. I can pretend I'm ok over text messages much easier than I can hide it in my voice. And make sure the pDoc is available to hear if anything happens ramping up. Hopefully that supportive person could even call your pDoc if you're not able (or wanting) to call them immediately yourself...and if I felt any ramping up I would stop the SSRI immediately.

""True mania"" includes psychosis about \~70% of the time and doesn't happen in hypomania. For the other 30% of 'true mania' without psychosis, it can be hard to tell exactly where the line is between hypo & manic. Especially in some situations - for instance, if someone doesn't remember as much on the high side, and they have people around them who dramaticize the symptoms. It's not like we can take a blood test to tell exactly. 

I have heard others draw distinctions between drug induced (often SSRIs) mania and ""organic"" episodes, although tbh so many bp people have a history of some drug use (legal / meds or otherwise) it's really hard to tell. 

Traditional medicine would say that SSRIs would only trigger mania in someone who already had bipolar. But, if they had never had a hypo or manic episode before, would they have otherwise had bipolar, or did getting put on a SSRI change their mental condition? Does it now mean that they need to be treated as a bipolar patient, or would it mean they just need to not take SSRIs? Usually it means they're now considered bipolar. It's complicated, and I don't have good answers there.

My first hypomanic episode was associated with an increasing dose of Adderall, and switching to the XR version. High dose adderall behaviors and hypomanic symptoms look an awful lot alike...and correlation of time is not causation, but the hypomanic symptoms did decrease when I forgot to pack it traveling and then stopped taking it for a couple months.

Thought being gay would send me to hell, thought suicide would send me to hell, so I would be either miserable the rest of my life, or tortured for eternity.

But it took some deep self-work to get to the point of realizing and accepting that I have some attraction to other males and transgender people. On a scale of 1-10, where 1 is ""attracted to only women"" and 10 is ""attracted to only men"", I'd say I'm probably a 2-3.

Within the last 6 months, I've disclosed actual bipolar to him, HR guy, my former boss, and a handful of team members. I'm in the process of disclosing more widely but decided to take that part slow. Everyone seems to be understanding and accepting. Perhaps there's rumors about me, or I wouldn't be considered for promotions as quickly as I used to be. But, I used to run myself ragged trying to prove myself and climb the corporate ladder, and am not interested in doing either of those here anymore. 

ADA accommodations can be helpful, and FMLA if it's available (depends on company size and how long you've worked there, usually). I just got ""intermittent FMLA"" approved in case I need it to deal with my next mood stabilizer dose change. Employer doesn't legally need to know the actual diagnosis; I decided to be transparent even though they sort of resisted hearing that level of detail.

\- Attendance: Assume I go to all classes, except not force myself to when I'm sick. Proactively communicate with professors. (I was working full time, and had the option to video chat for lectures, but I still went to nearly all of them in person)

\- Homework: Plan definitive times, but be flexible as above. Plan to finish at least a day ahead of time so I can review fresh before submitting.

\- Otherwise: Stop drinking, stop smoking before class. (took me another couple years to actually get sober). Yoga, exercise. Whole30 natural-food based elimination diet to figure out what food works for me. Neurofeedback. Sleep. Stop hanging out with friends where drinking is always the default activity.

In corporate cube-land, bp is mostly something to manage around. It does help with some creative things & divergent thinking. But my emotional & energetic sensitivity I attribute particularly to bp, and I appreciate, although that’s not used much at work and can be overwhelming at times. 

I’ve had to take sick days for some symptoms and some med adjustments, but it’s worked out to an average of a few days a year.

I’d say generally, creative works tend to jive better with the ups and downs, but salaried jobs can help with stability. Long term I imagine starting a business but the stability and ‘Golden handcuffs’ of a cushy corporate gig is hard to give up."
zerocarb,f9f37ay,t3_e4q9f8,1575258363.0,"I’ve had ~9 TBIs, also a host of mental health diagnoses. At some point or another I’ve experienced all the symptoms you’ve mentioned. Have degrees in neuroscience & engineering, which I’m super happy to have to be able to understand my own experiments.

I’ve been eating different diets for about 4 years now. Carnivore is the best for me, hands down. Gluten and sugar are the worst for me, paleo was good, keto helped a bunch (starting Jan ‘19), and carnivore (July ‘19)  is the best for my healing and recovery. BNDF and GABAergic production in keto, and the anti-inflammatory nature of carnivore in particular really help.

You’re literally rebuilding parts of your brain, with particular attention to the fatty myelin sheath that helps electrical transmission. This is why keto and/or carnivore can help in epilepsy (well doc’d), MS, bipolar (my Dx), and lots of neuro illnesses. Most neurology hasn’t caught up except for epilepsy if drugs don’t work.

Also, sobriety really helps for me. Part of me hates to say that, but especially dealing with critical neurogenesis effort - consuming alcohol, as a toxin and intoxicant isn’t likely to help. I thought cannabis helped my mood, but I’m better without it. I do use CBD though.

The last time I had any significant mental health symptoms reappear was after testing 1.5 weeks off carnivore, the longest I had been off keto since starting.  Learned my lesson that I’ll stay on this WOE for the foreseeable future. I tapered off one med with keto, and am coming down on another since carnivore. 

Quality matters; my body responds better to humanely raised meat. Fat is good, and I don’t have to add it for satiety like I did on keto, I just try and choose fatty cuts. I buy 1/4 cow at a time and keep it in my chest freezer until putting in the fridge 1-3 days before cooking, depending on thickness. If I want to defrost, I’ll usually do it with a water bath and then cook immediately. Microwave can be ok to defrost too. I’ll buy mostly grass fed beef or lamb, maybe bacon if I’m traveling or waiting on another cow delivery. Eating organs seems to help feel like things are more rounded our nutritionally. 

OTC supplements I take daily: Rhodiola, curcumin, methyl-protect (I’m heterozygous MTHFR gene), krill oil. CoQ10. NAD+, vit D.  Nightly: melatonin, magnesium threonate, CBD, lithium orotate 5mg.

Considering starting carbon60 oil, I’ve heard great things for TBI recovery.

Some will say no supplements are necessary on carnivore. That’s more likely true if there are no other health things going on.

Neurofeedback was HUGE for me. Got me off the daily Adderall I took for 7 years. If you look at it, look for a practitioner who starts with a qEEG brain map.

Also sleep, meditation, hot yoga, gratitude journaling, etc are big for me. And I hand write all my notes and to do lists, stuff seems to stick better that way.

Recovery comes, often slower than we want. Your optimistic perspective, that it’s possible and it’s happening, may be the most important thing.

Good luck and I wish you healing!

BipolarReddit,f89pd7h,t3_dwtrgf,1574377119.0,"Generally, lamictal seems to be safer in bipolar than SSRIs, especially SSRIs on their own. 

25mg x 2 / day may be the right dose, maybe not. I would bet that if it's a good med for you to be on, that you would notice some difference at least. Either way, the risk of steven johnson syndrome means people should generally start lower anyway.

I started on 25 mg / day and within 6 weeks titrated up to 100mg. A few years later, from 100 to 150mg, then a year ago, from 150 - 200. 2 months ago from 200 back to 150 and I'm feeling less side effects."
BipolarReddit,f89orhp,t3_dysrbi,1574376809.0,"The biggest side effect I noticed with seroquel was extreme drowsiness, physical fatigue, and brain fog. I was at 50mg; I hear that dose can make people more tired than higher doses, but I've never been on more than 50mg at a time.

I didn't crave carbs, but I was eating ketogenic at the time. Regardless of seroquel, if I'm eating carbs at all, I crave them (especially sugar) and my mood is way more stable in ketosis so I'm going to stick with that. I tried it for mood stability (I take lamictal, which works in epilepsy; ketogenic is successful in epilepsy treatment, so I figured I'd give it a shot) and fat loss wasn't the point but it was a nice side effect. I'm almost 34 and now weigh what I did halfway through high school. In total, I've lost about 65 lbs in the last few years.

Been keto since Jan '19. Since then, tapered off abilify and dropped lamictal from 200 to 150mg / day. Only time I really felt bp symptoms that were more than a blip for a day or two, was after stopping keto for a week. I might stay on keto / zerocarb for the rest of my life.

My hydration and electrolyte balance seem to have alot to do with any shaking or motor control for me. 

I also notice that either with lamictal dose changes, or general mood instability, that I have worse muscle control and balance. If I accidentally miss a lamictal dose, I am liable to walk into doorways. Not kidding, that's a way I've realized that I forgot my meds."

Mixed episodes are the most dangerous for me. Like I've been super impulsive and can't think past the loud racing thoughts (that I tried to self-medicate) but don't care what happens to me. Scariest places I've been in were mixed episodes. 

Either end of the spectrum can make me not think rationally. Mania and depression both lie to me about what's going on and how I should feel about it. ""It's never as good or bad as I think it is"" and ""this too will pass"" have both helped me. 

I really hope you can find a way to ground and come back closer to center."
BipolarReddit,f89n1ib,t3_dz2x3j,1574375938.0,"Sleep, for sure. Try to avoid any big life decisions. Consider ways that impulses won't lead to as permanent of impacts - for instance, giving someone else your credit cards, deleting social media apps if you're prone to impulsive posting, etc. Breathing! Exercise, although start slow if it's not part of your regular routine. Hot yoga seems to help me the most. Meditation is now huge for me - in the beginning, with so many racing thoughts, I could only start with a few minutes at a time but even that seemed to make a big positive difference. Benadryl can help but be careful not too use too much. Journaling - both stream-of-consciousness, to get the stuff out of my head, and gratitude journaling seem to help lots. 

Glad you're seeing the pdoc, hope you can be completely honest with them. 

My prescriber  and I eventually found an ""emergency brake"" medication (seroquel, for me) that I can take when I don't think I can stop the ramp-up on my own. But of course, please don't experiment with that stuff on your own. I'm only on a mood stabilizer (lamotrigene) at this point, so if I were to take it, I'd only have one antipsychotic on board. 

And I don't mean to nit-pick, but Latuda is an antipsychotic, not a mood stabilizer; even though the effect of the antipsychotic might be mood stabilization. Technically different classes of medications, which matters particularly if you're researching more on effects and side effects and such."

BipolarReddit,f89lr8x,t3_dzgqri,1574375283.0,"I used cannabis basically daily for 12 years. Helped me sleep, and  in the beginning also helped me pay attention in college classes. Adderall, weed, and caffeine were the mix that helped me stay present enough to take lecture notes. Was also a big part of my social culture. I used these as justifications for what could easily be described as cannabis use disorder.

I haven't used cannabis in almost 8 months at this point. I stopped using daily about 16 months ago. For the time in between slowing down and stopping completely - when I did use, I realized that it triggered symptoms for me. Sativas would make me feel hypomanic for 12 hours or so, then depressed for a few days; indicas just sent me from high to depressed for a few days. When that became clear to me, it just never felt worth it. When I was using daily, I didn't notice the aftereffects. 

I've learned it's a bad idea for me to mix. It's the ""typical advice"" for people with a bp diagnosis to go completely sober. When I was first diagnosed, I did not want to hear that shit, and when I then started medications, my drug / alcohol use became less reckless but still heavy and consistent. I was self-medicating mood symptoms and brain injury symptoms (although it's hard to tell which is which, tbh)

I do use CBD / 0%THC and that does seem to help sleep, mood stability, and helps reduce inflammation for me too."
BipolarReddit,f89kwyk,t1_f89hrke,1574374866.0,"This does not mean you're stupid at all! It would be crazy for you to not be overwhelmed hearing about BPD and bipolar. Glad you're asking questions here, though :)

I have a Dx of bp, not BPD, so I can speak to more of the bipolar side. An ex-girlfriend of mine has a mom with (untreated) bp and BPD, so I heard more secondhand from her. 

Symptoms and manifestations can overlap, so it can be hard to tell. Also, remember that diagnostic labels are trying to fit things in boxes, and are designed more for insurance purposes and than to be totally descriptive. 

The typical 'split' I hear described is that bipolar is more biochemical, and BPD is more emotional / personality patterning. But they can look very similar in how they show up in the world. For me, emotions and personality patterns and history of trauma play a huge part in both how my bp symptoms are triggered, and how they manifest when they do show up. 

On the label side of things - I've been diagnosed as bipolar II, then maybe bipolar I after a manic episode (but was it long enough to fit the criteria?) then maybe bipolar III (drug-induced? although I haven't heard consensus about what bpIII means). As well a history of emotional trauma and quite a few brain injuries. Also diagnosed with ADHD, cyclothymia, dysthymia, anxiety, depression. I now just roll those into bp symptoms. 

I'm somewhere on the bipolar spectrum, and exactly what label I'm associated with doesn't concern me as much as it used to. Finding and leaning into the habits, medications, intentions, etc. that help me feel better and give me more choice as to how I show up in the world is what matters most to me long term, but going through the 'typical' medical model treatments for the diagnoses above helped me figure out what worked and didn't."
BipolarReddit,f89i9pi,t3_dzpo7b,1574373540.0,"I no longer drink at all. More than 6 months totally sober. My alcohol use gradually decreased on its own - for maybe 12 years, I drank at least a couple everyday, often more; and around age 30 (nearly 4 years) ago started to slow down, stopped drinking every night. Gradually decreased from there. 

In the year before stopping completely, I had gotten drunk twice, I think. Hardly every more than 2 drinks at a time, even that amount only once a month or so. A few months without it at all.

And...the less I drank, the more it affected me when I did drink, so the worse I felt - then, the longer I'd go without drinking, and the more sensitive I'd become, and the worse I felt afterward. I'm glad to be done with it.

BipolarReddit,f863uo8,t3_dy7weo,1574289198.0,"Told my former boss today, who now works on a different team. Very supportive, accepting, etc. ""You always did good work.""

She also said...""I""m not surprised. You did seem to have some ups and downs.""

And, the big part...I had forgotten that an ex-girlfriend of mine emailed her (and my current boss, and someone else, I'm not sure who) during a manic episode in May of '18, while I was on PTO, to say I was ""having a mental health crisis."" Ah yes. My current boss showed me the email after I got back from PTO, but this former boss of mine and I had never talked about that. Slipped my mind; also my memory tends to fry a bit in mania.

So, no surprise to her than I have some mental health diagnosis after she randomly got an email saying I was in a mental health crisis.

I didn't ask former boss to keep confidentiality - first time I've disclosed to a co-worker and not asked that. I do trust her discretion, and said that if she knew anyone struggling with symptoms who wanted someone to talk to, that she'd give them my info.

She agreed that 1:1 disclosures would be better than an email blast. I think the last step in fully disclosing would be to put up a LinkedIn post - open to be seen by basically every professional connection I've ever had. She suggested I make that look quite professional, put up medical research or something since most of my work has been in the medical field. may be good for me to have a simple blog or something up to direct people to before I take that last step.

Still having coffee with former co-worker on Friday, who I think could give me helpful feedback about how things work more on a legal & political basis at my company.

Thanks for the pushback and feedback; I'm still moving forward with being more open but doing so in a more measured way.

BipolarReddit,f80sm3h,t3_dy7weo,1574137174.0,"Update - back from weekly support group. At the end of each meeting, we go around the room with - are we safe, something good that happened this week, and a goal for the upcoming week. 

My goal for this week is to think and feel into what I want to accomplish by disclosing to my teammates. I'm leaning more toward a series of 1:1 disclosures instead of an email blast. And starting with a small group. Or not at all - I still want to be more open about it, but for this moment I'm recognizing that I don't know what I want exactly. I'm traveling for Thanskgiving starting next Monday, so if I'm looking for things in person, the earliest I would do anything would be in December. 

I'm glad for y'all, for the feedback and the chance to step back, pause, and think and feel more into it. I've had this underlying sense of rushing around everything in life, for a long time now. I have the story some of that was related to not knowing how long I'd be alive, fears of suicide, etc. It's getting easier for me to think I can be easier about things and easier with myself...and that I don't need to feel so much pressure all the time. And recognizing that the sense of internal pressure is both a trigger for, and an indicator of, feeling more revved up. I have no reason I have to be in a rush for this, whatever this turns out to be. 

Thanks, all - I appreciate the thoughtful responses, the vulnerability, and helping me gain some more self-awareness."
BipolarReddit,f80fz1o,t3_dy7weo,1574128128.0,"Thanks for the challenge, everyone, I'm here to keep an open mind and for feedback. And I do appreciate the kind words. I feel sadness and compassion for those who haven't had good experiences. 

tl;dr I'm going to think more about it before doing anything, and talk with my weekly bp support group tonight. 

Re: dealing with hypomanic symptoms - I did quite a number of things to bring my mood back in balance. I didn't use all the tools in my kit, so to speak, but - 1) back to zerocarb eating, 2) sleep, 3) alpha-stim neuromodulation, 4) Touchpoint bilateral tactile stimulation, 5) meditation, 6) hot yoga, 7) breathwork, 8) embodiment exercises, 9) tinkering with supplements, namely CBD (0% THC, I’m sober now) melatonin, magnesium and rhodiola, and 10) gratitude and stream-of-consciousness journaling. As well as checking in with family and friends who have been supportive in the past. 

Real human connection also helps me self-regulate, and I spent the next day in an ""Authentic Relating"" workshop where the point is to move very slowly, allow myself to feel and express emotions that are coming up, and to be highly aware of the impact I'm having on others, who will give me honest feedback about their emotional impact. Part of a practice called ""circling"" which I really appreciate.  

I had ativan and seroquel on hand, but I was able to get back within my normal feeling range within a day or so, and I try to avoid taking those if I can. If I had kept up hypomanic symptoms another day, I probably would've gone for the seroquel, since that knocks me out so quickly.

The feeling of an internal pressure to share with the world - definitely related to hypomanic symptoms (sometimes, not always) and I was aware of that relationship as I was going through it. The 'experiment' was a built on the framework of a self-development program (Dojo) I've been doing for the past few months. I had defined goals, a bail-out plan, what to watch out for, boundaries, when to stop, and a 'spotter' who has been doing this particular program for a couple years and agreed to keep me in check. I had been considering what I wanted an exercise to look like for the previous month or so, and this one felt like it flowed into place. 

So, now that I feel like I've provided context, or defended myself here, the meat of the question of ""who really needs to know? Is this a good idea?"" Thank you for the reflections and the challenge. 

I'm willing to consider that not everyone needs to know, and that I may feel like I'm 'on a roll' with the positive responses I've gotten so far. I know that even if things have been going well,  there is a risk of taking things too far. 

I did tell my boss a few weeks ago that I planned to disclose to our team sometime this month, although I'm under no obligation to do so. My thought is to email my immediate team and those I work most closely with, not to shoot out a company-wide email or anything like that. Understanding that it could get to the rest of the company, sure, but only feeling like I would want to directly tell people who I'm closer with. 

The thought of more 1:1 disclosures is one I wrote off, thinking that we're all busy and that this would be easier - but it's probably good to give that one more thought. 

Heading out to weekly bp support group in a minute here; I've talked about my disclosure experiment with them and some have seen it on facebook. Should be a good place to hear reflections. 

Thanks all, much love

BipolarReddit,ezaf1mo,t3_d0l8ou,1567800247.0,"I think it's great you're doing it! Journaling for me has been such an important part of my healing, growth, and processing. I could be ""stable and productive"" on meds + therapy, but actually getting better feels like it requires journaling. I do so at least a few times a week now, sometimes every day.

Maybe it's ok to feel triggered when journaling. There's nothing coming out on the page that wasn't in you before then - and trying to avoid or suppress it doesn't work for me. 

Gratitude is one of the most important things I can journal about, and it's a way I can 'come back' when I feel the spiral in anger or whatever. When I feel that anger cycle come up, it helps to just keep journaling through it, maybe take some time to settle and let the thoughts/feelings integrate, but to move through it and process what I can. There can be insight on the other side of the anger - but for me the feeling of relief of getting it out is more immediate and significant. Maybe it takes longer to process through than you want, but my bet would be that the more you do it, the easier and faster it will be for the energy and emotions to move."
BipolarReddit,eysolqv,t3_cyaegv,1567406150.0,"The best thing for me was to do a Whole30 program to see what worked for me and what didn't. One single diet isn't going to work for everyone, and don't believe anyone that tells you one size fits all. Depends on your metabolism, gut microbiome, much less your preferences, family situation, etc. A clean eating test, with scheduled re-introductions to test your responses to food, may be the best way to see what works for you.

Personally, over the past 3.5 years: Whole30 --> strict gluten free; gluten triggers depression and a whole host of other symptoms. Then mostly paleo, then keto, which made a big mood difference. Then sober (yeah, that's a big difference too). Then from keto --> zerocarb / carnivore, which is the best I've felt. Mood, energy, gut, etc. 

For me, the biggest things that trigger mood stuff : gluten, alcohol, cannabis, sugar. FODMAPS trigger gut issues, which lead to lack of energy/focus, but it doesn't impact my mood directly like the other 4 above do. 

I'm thinking dairy might not be good for me either - I'm currently in the process of testing casein (dairy protein) a1 and casein a2. Looking like casein a1 (mostly in cow's milk) and I don't get along well - I've thought it was just lactose intolerance, but I think I'm noticing a mood impact from zero carb cow's milk cheese as well, which points to casein a1 beyond lactose. Casein a2 (goat, sheep's milk) is easier to digest but I don't think it has the mood trigger that a1 seems to.

Side effects on lamictal now are mostly 2 things - facial twitches, which started when I went from 150 to 200 a year ago. They went down for a while but have come back more frequent and widespread in my face. Also, emotional blunting is more noticable and doesn't feel like it's serving me like it used to. But generally it's been so long on this drug, with so many other life / health changes, it's hard to tell what's me vs the drug"
BipolarReddit,eyradg1,t3_ckyvj6,1567363824.0,"Yes, I'm on Lamictal monotherapy at 200mg. Abilify is the only other psychotropic I've used other than ativan / xanax for anxiety (which I really really want to avoid). I've been on Lamictal monotherapy for about 9 of the last 12 years.

Took me 6 months to successfully taper off abilify. 1 doc tried to get me from 10mg --> 0 over 2 days, and I went straight back into mania. A nurse psychiatrist tried to get me from 2.5mg --> 0 in 2 weeks, and I spiraled into a non-functional, disoriented depression. I've been back to Lamictal monotherapy for the past 6 months. 

I'm at the point where I'm looking to reduce the Lamictal as well. My initial goal - I think - is to get from 200mg --> 150 --> 100 over a few months. I'm noticing muscle twitches in my face, which have happened since I ramped up from 150 --> 200 about a year ago. They've waxed and waned in frequency / annoyance but they've been coming back recently. More significantly, I feel the blunting of emotions (although nowhere near as bad as abilify). I think I'm generally in a good and stable enough place to start tapering...not sure if my end goal will be a lower Lamictal dose or someday off completely. I had written off the hope of ever getting to 0 meds with bp shortly after diagnosis. But I'm opening to the thought that it might be possible for some people, if the guardrails and healthy habits are strong enough in the rest of life. 

Thankfully that's not a decision I have to make now. My nurse psychiatrist and I have been talking about reducing Lamictal for the past few months - in July, the reason we didn't start was because of a spiritual opening I've been going through. I told her those changes felt significant enough that I wanted to keep the Lamictal consistent and she agreed (thankfully she's more spiritually open / in touch than most of the medical professionals I've encountered). I just started with a new transpersonal therapist, who is encouraging of reducing dose and is very reserved / hesitant but open to the idea that some people can come off of meds completely if ""strict rituals"" are held in place for dealing with the beginnings of mood episodes. 

I hesitate to post this because I know it's so dangerous for people to think they can get by without meds. I've certainly thought it would never be possible for me or anyone who actually has bp. But this is real for me, and where I'm at. I am trying to do this in a very pragmatic, long term fashion; not flushing my meds down the toilet at once or anything like that. I get pretty specific / defined symptoms of withdrawl if I accidentally miss a day of Lamictal, which thankfully happens only about once every 3-4 months. 

So, I feel like I'm perhaps playing with fire here, considering the chance that I could ever go off completely. My initial goal is only to reduce Lamictal and see how that goes - but it's the thought that perhaps, starting this Wednesday, I may take the first step in that direction. 

Really trying to be present with what's going on in this moment, and not get caught in my mind about a potential future that may never happen, and that I couldn't predict anyway."
BipolarReddit,ey5oo9y,t3_cvnkmg,1566836747.0,"Yeah, I feel you there! It's awesome that you're looking at buying a house; many people with this disorder have a hard time even fathoming that. 

Beyond all the normal tools and coping mechanisms (exercise, meditation, diet, etc) for me, what seemed to help was leaning into appreciation for the situation, recognizing that it's an emotional experience for most everyone and it's part of the process. I got so angry the first time I lost a bid that I literally ripped my shirt in half (despite being 'stable' in all aspects of my life). Add to the fact that I bought in a hot market, and had to be ready to put an offer in as soon as I saw a place...so my tendency toward impulsivity seemed to be required in order to have a shot at getting something. 

It's easier for it to be a non-emotional experience if you're looking for an income property, but looking at a home, with someone you love, is going to have some emotional charge. I'd say, do everything you can with the rest of the tools you have, recognize it's an emotional process. Recognize and appreciate the position you're in - it can be exciting, and after you buy a house, there will be lots of headaches with homeownership too. The searching process can be fun with all the future possibilities, and perhaps it's a time to reflect on the life situation that allows you to even be looking.

I used to think pot really helped me...it felt better in the short term but I don't think it helped me heal or stabilize long term."
BipolarReddit,exix3kn,t3_ct5c74,1566337361.0,"I haven't been through ECT - but for me, tACS (transcranial alternating current stimulation), tDCS (direct current stim), and rTMS (repetitive magnetic stim) have all been good. 

rTMS is the most widespread and the most researched in terms of depression. Doesn't seem to have nearly the negative effect on memory as ECT does."
BipolarReddit,exiwwhi,t3_csk4b4,1566337244.0,"Yep! My depression and anxiety started to lift basically immediately after we totally split up. Also stopped using pot daily just after breaking up (the first time), which definitely helped. It then tapered off to \~ 1-2 times a month until we were completely disconnected, when she moved the rest of her shit that she stored out of my basement, etc. She and I smoked together daily most all of our relationship, and I associated being around her with using, so it felt way easier to be sober on my own. 

It also opened up space in my life to find a new friend group, not dependent on 1 person, and where pot / alcohol (including happy hours) were not the default social activity. Authentic relating, ecstatic dance, the conscious community generally have all been great people for me so far :)

That ""grey area"" when still seeing each other, occasionally sleeping together after breaking up, wasn't good for the mental health of either of us..."
BipolarReddit,etxqtxw,t3_ce02t9,1563305327.0,"Edit - Most important basic things for me: Consistent meds (experimentation with prescriber may be necessary). Sleep. Clean eating, avoiding alcohol or drugs. Therapy. Exercise. Meditation and conscious breathing.

&#x200B;

A relentless focus on being healthy. For me - a mindset of promoting health, not one of ""avoiding disease"" - I find the positive focus makes a difference for me.

&#x200B;

Here's what works best for me, ymmv: Regular meds, only Lamictal for me right now. Strict clean eating, paleo and/or keto. Exercise / yoga 5x week. Good sleep. No alcohol or drugs. Daily meditation, usually 20+ minutes. Supportive friends / family (especially those where alcohol / drugs are not the default social activity). Supplements. Regular doctor, nurse psychiatrist, therapist - and finding new ones if I can't trust or open up to them. Bodywork (energy, craniosacral, fascial release work). Conscious / rebirthing breathwork. Nature & sunlight. Learning. Reading. Spiritual growth. Neuro/biofeedback. Moving closer to my passions and overall career purpose in life. Avoiding most TV and negatively oriented news. Journaling. Bipolar support group. Listening to my body and intuition. Authentic and honest emotional communication. Not judging myself harshly. Often experimenting with lifestyle changes to make things better. Being vigilant that if I don't keep on top of my health, things could go sideways quickly - and even if I'm doing everything I can, I could still become unstable, so creating backup plans (FMLA, ""emergency brake"" medications, writing instructions to myself, giving friends / family each other's phone numbers, etc)

&#x200B;

Things I'm really blessed to have: supportive friends & family. A stable, well-paying, flexible FT job with a boss and HR guy who have been really accommodating. Access   to and a hobby of neurofeedback / neuromodulation / biofeedback technologies: EEG neurofeedback, transcranial magnetic & electrical stim (not ECT). Biofeedback (heart rate variability). Photobiomodulation (cranial infrared stimulation)

&#x200B;

Perhaps most of all: Being present and thankful in the moment as much as possible, and ""coming back to my breath"" is what helps this the most."

BipolarReddit,escziao,t1_escz8dg,1561843048.0,Thank you! 🙏that’s encouraging 😊
