What's quality of life in the first place? If it is the ability to spend most of your time consuming stuff you don't really need of want just because it gives you that moment of instant gratification then capitalism is a success

gifs,fqwgfjj,t1_fqw7xvt,1589703506.0,"Capitalism is what allows the richest 1% to treat the rest of the population as their slaves (as shown in the gif). Capitalism is not a reliable system (in fact it periodically crashes every 10-20 years) and even in its top performances it fails to distribute resources equally. Leaving millions of people in absolute poverty.
Plus as a matter of fact capitalism is reducing the quality of our lives.
After the second World War people decided that our society should have been focused on welfare and wellbeing. That geve us a couple of decent decades but that ideal had soon been forgotten in exchange for a society focused on increasing profits and margins, where always more often people's wellbeing is sacrificed in the name of economic growth (as shown in the gif). It's not a case if the most developed countries are also the ones that score the highest when it comes to issues like depression, anxiety and suicide rates. 
You say that in the past we got it worse and you are right but that's really not an excuse to let horrible things happen today."
