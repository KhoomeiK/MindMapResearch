That's putting the cart *way* before the horse. 

Talking about opening up the relationship is one thing. But *after* the fact? The power imbalance involved in that would be catastrophic. At that point it isn't an open relationship, it's accepting being cheated on as the new norm. My comment was flippant because of how off-base your suggestion was considering everything I've said here is so obvious it should be instinctual.

If someone fatally stabbed someone else and then found out that their victim was going to die of cancer in three weeks anyway, that doesn't make the first person any less of a murderer. That's why suggestions to open up a marriage *in response to cheating* is idiotic as all fuck."

I do have to disagree with  your statement, though I appreciate your reply. Part of what makes V'ger work for me is its child-like and nigh-autistic stance. It's what makes it believable, and drives its need to merge with the ""carbon units"".

V'ger isn't a godlike entity, at least not until *after* the merge. Before, it's a curious computer, probably with some form of rudimentary emotions or impulses, but with a point of reference for what emotion even is. I mean, just imagine travelling through the endless cosmos, expanding your knowledge past all known limits in terms of physics, astronomy, data collection, etc. All hard numbers with quantitative implications. Along the way, you find out about this weird, mysterious thing -- perhaps the *only* mysterious thing to your ordered mind -- that defies anything that makes sense: *Feelings*. Wants, needs, drives, passions, fears, etc. None of these really make sense. Many of them are fundamentally counter-intuitive to a structured mind like V'Ger's whose spent countless lifetimes making sense of the universe around it.

Once it learns all it can learn on its own, it turns around to address it's own final frontier, these mystical emotions that it doesn't have access to and can't simply scan to find out about.

Both the childlike curiosity of V'ger and it's ignorance to feeling are the two things that make V'ger compelling as both a concept and a character. It really couldn't have gone any other way without being a contrived cliche, in my opinion. This way, V'Ger is relatable to at least some of us. Making V'Ger a ""villain"" would have made the movie bland and detached from the element of discovery TMP is going for. In the end, the villain isn't an enemy, it's ignorance, and the decision to willfully learn at the end is what saves the day. I feel like any adjustment to what V'Ger is would dramatically undercut the film's unique tension, as well as its fundamental message: V'Ger did what the rest of us should do to become more than what we are. It sought out answers and allowed the answers to turn it into something new."

Just wanted to add that, in the end, the best way to get into it all is simply to jump in wherever you want, find out what you like and dislike, and then continue on with the stuff you like. If you bog yourself down too much with notions of getting things in the right order or what's best, you'll rob yourself of the experience of exploring it all on your own! :-)"

With all of the books, comics, games, series, and films coming down the pipeline, every possible question we could ever possibly have will eventually be answered, which is pretty damn cool."
startrek,fqdm6z8,t3_gi1mb6,1589292524.0,"Everything you mentioned is an aspect of the film that I love. I know everyone has different opinions, but are you certain you know what you're saying?

Also, as an autistic person... you can eat shit.

EDIT: I retract my shit-eating suggestion. I definitely read what you said in the wrong way. I thought you were throwing the term around in a 4channish way. My apologies!"
startrek,fqdjrzf,t3_gi2kod,1589291160.0,"I absolutely love it while simultaneously recognizing the occasional flaw, but the same can be said for pretty much anything. I'm very very eager for season 3. I will say that its different style, which is a turn-off to some, is the only way the franchise will survive. We need new blood. We need new Trekkies. Disco is the perfect show for that. I know several people irl whose first Trek series was Disco, and that's their starting point for their understanding of this universe in the same way the TOS films and TNG was to me, and I find that really really neat. Disco, in much the same way as the Kelvin films, is leading people to seek out the older series who otherwise never would have been receptive to it. Kelvin and Disco are the *perfect* Gateway Trek to get folks addicted to everything else. This is how we grow."

startrek,fqdisb2,t3_gi5l8h,1589290577.0,"It seems that way to humans because we anthropomorphize them. We read their facial expressions and tones of voice through a human perspective. From their point of view, they're merely stating facts insofar as they know them. They're not being arrogant, they're just using the most efficient and direct words they need to use in order to convey whatever message they're wanting to convey, without the social accoutrements and verbal bells and whistles that you and I would throw in to add tone. Without that stuff, they seem rude. And sometimes they probably do get legitimately rude, but for the most part it's a misunderstanding originated from our need to ascertain tone and intent in a speaker's voice where there sometimes isn't any."

The Welcome to Springfield group drew in that crowd. Any given place will always be better than its local news comment section representation. At least that's what I tell myself."

I see how it comes across rereading it now though, but I've been working on spreadsheets all day so I'm kind of in robot mode, not phrase-things-like-a-person mode. There wasn't any agitation or ire on my end. Oops!"
StarWarsLeaks,fqaneac,t1_fqamq13,1589222014.0,"I'd say it's the other way around. I don't care about the details at all. The purpose of details is to make the bigger, more general things feel more real. You told me I'm hung up on the details while simultaneously using a pedantic detail people routinely get hung up on to address my concern. I could invoke any tiny piece of canon or continuity to explain in-universe why something stupid was done, but that doesn't mean it wasn't bad in reality. I'm not talking about the in-universe happenings between the characters, I'm talking about the real-world application of pacing and presence. It's a movie before it's a universe."
StarWarsLeaks,fqa7vw4,t1_fq9xzrq,1589214381.0,"Same. I recognize ESB as the superior film, while still having ROTJ as my personal favorite because of the attachment I had to it as a kid. I can't watch the newest version of it, though. For the most part, I haven't been overly troubled by the Special Editions or any subsequent changes. I had to draw the line at Vader's *NOOOOOOO* when he saves Luke, though. That one moment entirely undercut about half an hour of finely-tuned dramatic tension.

The magic of the moment was being able to see Vader's gears turning behind his mask without any other indication beyond the perfect combination of cinematography, body language, music, and pacing. All four of those elements came into alignment in that moment, and we KNEW what Vader was thinking without anything needing to be said.... and then that one change completely destroyed the moment. I hate to sound crass, but now it's like the film version of *coitus interruptus*. It's like listening to a symphony that spends its length and breadth leading to this one moment that provides context to every prior moment, only for the orchestra to suddenly lay down their instruments at the last possible moment before the penultimate chord resolves and whip out kazoos.

It's like this:  [https://youtu.be/-w-58hQ9dLk](https://youtu.be/-w-58hQ9dLk)

Anyway, all that to say: I agree with you. I kind of went off on a tangent there. Sorry!"
StarWarsLeaks,fq9peef,t1_fpwv83l,1589204229.0,"I have trouble seeing the lightsabers thing as the beginning of a trend. The changing of the saber colors seems so inconsequential to me that I can't really label it as a full-blown retcon in my head. I know that's technically what a retcon is, but when I think of *continuity*, I think of who shot who, who married who, who blew up what planet, etc., not something as small and inconsequential as that."

I remember a user names DurhamRockerz or something who made hilarious videos. Everyone else didn't really get it, though. They just randomly repeated things. They didn't understand that it wasn't random, there really was a Tim and Eric brand of nuance going on in the good ones."
