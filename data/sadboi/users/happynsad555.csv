bipolar,fquntgz,t1_fqumx9b,1589661850.0,"You’re welcome! Do you think your friends and family will react negatively to meds? I thought my mom would too... we are Asian and mental health is not talked about in my culture. I told my mother I felt suicidal once and she walked away, only to come back 5 mins later and ask if I wanted breakfast. I told her about my medication and what bipolar is, and why we fought so much throughout my life. While she hasn’t directly told me what she thinks, I know she appreciates it because our relationship is just so much better now. Don’t underestimate how much your family and friends care about you - they may not care about the meds, only that you are getting healthy. Your mental health is part of you. I hope you find the drive to seek help sooner than later ❤️"

bipolar,fquc8nj,t3_gkwdym,1589656162.0,"27F. I have a problem with asking for help. I was experiencing depression and hypomanic states for about 10 years before I sought help. I managed it on my own just fine for those 10 years. Got a BA, MA, had a career working working and living in NYC. Wasn’t diagnosed until recently because I’m doing a PhD and couldn’t handle the lack of sleep - I need to be sharp in academia. Point is that there are bipolar people who are plenty capable, and could possibly “handle” these episodes alone, but you’re not going to have a good time doing it. Doing it alone is harder. Take it from someone who was so resistant to asking for help via meds and therapy. It was only after doing therapy that I realized that my core beliefs were that asking for help was a weakness, stemmed from me being a very independent child. I’m working on rerouting those thought processes so I can be a healthier person. I think you know you are unhealthy. You won’t get anywhere until you accept that you need help. That was me months ago.

Please feel free to message me if you wanna chat more!"

bipolar2,fq2csj2,t3_gfg8ui,1589054903.0,"Recently diagnosed here, had been using weed to manage for years now. I had been using it to either dull me or make me feel alive, depending on the mood. I saw a psychiatrist who diagnosed me after using weed alone stopped helping me sleep. I use it to sleep every night, and when I wake up, I need to smoke to fall asleep again (2-3x/night), even on my mix of Seroquel and gabapentin. I want to have a healthier relationship with weed. I told my doc that I’m not interested in cutting it out of my life, but I want to use it for fun again and not be so dependent. She suggested I switch to 1:1 CBD to THC as I wean off my dependency. I have anxiety just thinking about it - I tried to do this while we were figuring out my meds and got rebound insomnia. My brain has been used to being flooded with THC for the last 10 years. Did you initially have a healthy relationship with weed when you were diagnosed? What are some steps I can take to move towards a healthier relationship?"
bipolar2,fpp5y84,t3_gebofw,1588796538.0,"Hey, we are smart. I don’t do things last minute all the time now but definitely did this throughout high school, college, even now sometimes during my PhD. I’ll make a 25-min PowerPoint presentation within a day (that stuff always takes longer than you think!) and successfully present it the next day when I had 2 months to do it."
bipolar2,fpp4g51,t3_genz4k,1588795791.0,"Yes, yes, yes. It caused me an increase in anxiety and racing thoughts, and I didn’t sleep for a week (1.5-4 hours a night). My psychiatrist really wanted me to stick to it because the mood stabilizing effects apparently don’t kick in for a few weeks. I couldn’t handle the lack of sleep, I was going crazy. I’m a PhD student so you can imagine how difficult it was for me to be present in class. 

Interesting that you take Trazodone, I had a bad reaction to a 100mg dose with again more racing thoughts and anxiety, and that’s one of the reasons my psychiatrist suspected bipolar. 

I’m currently on a mix of gabapentin and Seroquel, and I was sleeping 7-9 hours a night before finals week (this week). Lots of anxiety because of my exams. My psychiatrist increased my dosage of Seroquel and it helped. 

Could you perhaps grab a phone appointment soon and talk about switching or adding medication so you can get some sleep before the GRE? Even a short term solution like Ambien to help you encode as much info as possible in that brain! 

Good luck and hello fellow bipolar academic :)"
BipolarReddit,fpdcuzb,t3_gcrsy7,1588524487.0,"I work for academia and have been recently diagnosed bipolar. Speaking with my psychiatrist and therapist has made me realize that I’ve had symptoms since before high school. These are the things that I’ve been doing as a coping mechanism for my symptoms, very similar to what OP had. 

Routine. When the world was open, I had a very strict routine. Losing that made me spiral into the worst episode of anxiety and insomnia I’ve ever had.

Exercise. It helped me learn discipline. I think I’ve been using exercise as a way to get rid of all the excess energy I’ve had. I seem to be hyper aware of my hypomanic states and use the same discipline I learned in strength training to pull myself back from distraction, especially now as I find myself ultra-distracted for finals next week. 3 days ago I cried all day because I’m nervous about an oral exam with a professor just nominated to NAS. Pulled myself back every time, and let myself rest when I knew I had met my goal. Sometimes things can’t be controlled like this though. 

Self-care. I take the time to do my hair and makeup in the morning. Or a facial at night, nails, etc. I’ve found if I don’t feel good about myself then it bleeds into my moods. 

Medication. This is a new one! I’m on mood stabilizers with the end goal of regulating my sleep better, and the drowsy side effects help a lot. Still trying to find the right dosage. Was working for a week and now it’s not. Might be because of exam anxiety, but I have another appt with my psychiatrist tomorrow to talk about meds. I’ve been a stoner for the last 10 years and managed my symptoms before prescription medication with marijuana, and realize now that’s a no-no for anxious people. I’m taking the steps to wean off of it. 

Sleep. I’ve been mood tracking and my anxiety and irritability are connected to sleep. I’m not getting any these days, gotta tweak my meds. 

Therapy. It’s helping me understand myself better, and I can already see that I’m managing my symptoms better."

bipolar2,fpao69n,t3_gcb4lc,1588452218.0,"The hardest thing to deal with is my anxiety and the resulting insomnia, which then fuels more anxiety with the addition of irritability. I didn’t realize I was an anxious person until I saw a psychiatrist. She asked me, “how much do you worry?” And I didn’t know how to answer the question. It was only after a few therapy sessions that my anxiety manifests in always planning for the future. I hope to be able to manage it soon."
bipolar2,fowm38r,t3_g9ybzd,1588122472.0,"I was diagnosed during my area’s shelter in place order recently via virtual assessments. I’ve come to have a good rapport with my doc and we’re on our way to finding the right medications and dosages for me. At first it was really difficult because my insomnia was getting to me. Today, I had another virtual appointment with another doc because I need to make the transition to a long-term psychiatrist, as the one before was just a short-term psychiatry support for primary care. I had a good experience. Once the shelter in place is lifted, I will probably have an additional in-person assessment. Good luck."

Fukumoto et al., 2001. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11685390/

The paper is a little outdated, so here’s a more recent one that shows up regulation in hippocampal cell culture.
De-Paula et al, 2016. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27882645/

A quick skim through some recent papers and I didn’t see much about neurogenesis. No experimental methods to show that, only BDNF upregulation, which is not enough to demonstrate neurogenesis. However, did find a paper that shows that lithium treatment promotes cell survival (less apoptosis). This paper is in the context of seizures.

bipolar2,fn0luzf,t3_fyj78a,1586544334.0,"Oh gosh, I was diagnosed just last week. I never would’ve thought. Yes, maybe Major Depressive because those episodes are loud and obvious, but apparently I’ve been in a low, constant hypomanic state for months, according to my psychiatrist. I also had a great routine, made sure to wake up/sleep at the same time, exercise most days of the week. I’ve always been high-achieving, so never really attributed my ability to keep working and working with hypomania. I can sleep very little and be fully functional. I think I knew I had a problem years ago and refused to see a psychiatrist because I didn’t want to be put on meds. All the while keeping my routine, eating healthy foods, and exercising. I was able to function for years doing that, but eventually I found my easily distracted mind/lack of sleep/racing thoughts slightly detrimental. I’m in my first year of a STEM PhD program and I can’t have this happen, so I sought help. I feel the benefits of the meds right away, though there still needs to be some adjustment I think because my insomnia hasn’t gone away yet. It is up to you, but if you ever feel like your routine doesn’t cut it and you’re too wired or depressed, it would be a good idea to talk to your psychiatrist.

Message me anytime if you wanna talk. :)"
bipolar2,fn0jzod,t3_fyc9t9,1586543338.0,"Fuck yes I feel this so badly. Me being so reactive had almost completely ruined my relationships with my family. Before I was referred to a psychiatrist, my brother made a comment to me and said I didn’t need to be so emotional about every small thing. Fast forward to weeks of 0-5 hrs of sleep everyday, I was referred and my psychiatrist diagnosed me and put me on mood stabilizers. Working on my relationships with my mom especially, but she is also pretty reactive and refuses to talk about mental health. I find that on meds I do not have that impulse to keep the fight going. It’s like my brain can’t rise to that. Instead I respond calmly and she’s also able to calm. This has been great in improving my relationships. I don’t think it would be a waste of your time if you were to talk to your psychiatrist about adjusting your meds/do an assessment with a psychiatrist."
