Im Vorbeiradeln habe ich heute die geöffneten Geschäfte beobachtet: Teils bilden sich Warteschlagen vor Boutiquen, Einkaufsstraßen sind wieder gut gefüllt, kleine Geschäfte lassen teils nur 1 Person eintreten aber manchmal wird auch das ignoriert, Busspuren vor Läden sind wieder munter zugeparkt und der Verkehr hat spürbar zugenommen.

I started cycling to class every morning and in freezing temperatures I was certainly not always ""motivated"" but it had just become part of my everyday life so I did it anyways. It sounds like you're already on a good path. Can you perhaps think of more little things to eat fewer calories, add more protein and exercise more?"
WeightLossAdvice,fjo9sxc,t3_fef2u7,1583523452.0,Are you counting and logging your calories? How much are you typically eating?

Possibility 2) From my experience the body gets really stubborn when undereating for a longer time and refuses to lose more weight. Please go to https://tdeecalculator.net/ and eat at least your BMR."

WeightLossAdvice,fjn1oip,t3_fe7uxt,1583494581.0,"I haven't fully fixed my binge eating yet but I found ways to control/limit it:

* Don't starve yourself during the day, find filling foods with low calories. Veggies, soup, Greek yogurt and crispbread work for me.
* Likewise, if you're a stresseater then find low cal things to chew on. Maybe something as simple as chewing gum can help.
* Don't keep foods in the house that you know you'll binge on. Keeping pickles in the house is fine for me, chocolate is not.
* If you have a bad habit of buying snacks, train yourself to buy a replacement instead. Instead of candy bars I buy sugarfree protein bars. 
* Know your trigger foods and whether cutting them out completely is easier than just limiting them. For me that's sugar.
* It's okay to have nice treats once in a while when healthy food gets too boring (as long as it doesn't trigger you). Just remember to count the calories!
* Even if you ended up binging, count the calories and track everything! Hold yourself accountable! Don't fall into the ""nothing matters"" mindset!
* If you feel that you can't control the binge eating at all consider getting help. Look for guided or non-guided support groups, ask your GP for resources, consider therapy."

You could think about what items you could keep at work or in the gym locker. Perhaps you'll also identify some items that you don't need to always carry around. Post workout protein - protein timing doesn't matter that much, perhaps you can keep some whey or protein bars at work instead? Keep a charger at home and in the office but don't carry it around maybe? Are there smaller sizes of the handcream and sanitizer available?"

My whole European pizza has 900kcal, her American one has over 2000. I know the memes about American portion sizes but what the fresh fuck? How?? The pizza is not even larger, it's basically just 3 pizzas on top of each other??

Even in my most overweight days my weight was naturally limited by the lifestyle over here but living in America must make it so much harder to keep those pounds off, damn."
