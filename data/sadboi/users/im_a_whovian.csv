I'm fine with deriving something purely from logic and maths, but there has to be a qualitative derivation for it as well."

PhysicsStudents,f5qyr9a,t3_dow829,1572385303.0,"If you could stretch dynamics to include rotational dynamics (due to circular motion), you could find the moment of inertia of a flywheel through experimentation. Otherwise, you could investigate the relation between magnetic and electric fields inducing EMFs and currents in coils (Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, Lenz's law, mutual inductance, the effect of ferromagnetic metals vs non-ferromagnetic metals inserted into a mutual inductance set up). I would stay away from quantum mechanics and relativity. Young's double-slit is perfect for demonstrating the wave nature of light. Demonstrating conservation of momentum during collisions using an air track and light gates if they're available is quite an interesting experiment. Gravitational field experiments are a bit hard to demonstrate since they need high-end precision equipment to measure the effect of the gravitational effect of one block on another, but if you manage to get such equipment, it is quite technical. Hope this helps."

learnmath,ew58d3c,t3_cmsov2,1565130103.0,"If you need what is equivalent to an A-Level syllabus, I'd recommend looking into books by Bostock and Chandler, namely Core Course for A Level Maths, Further Pure Mathematics and, if you need it, Mechanics and Probability. If you're taking any physics or engineering course, mechanics is a must. Core Course and Further Pure are about basic algebraic functions (logarithms, indices, partial fractions, sum and product of roots of a quadratic etc.), integration, differentiation, differential equation, in-depth trigonometry, vectors, complex numbers, matrices, coordinate geometry, some basic probability, and so on - the basic topics you need for uni. Good luck!"
Baking,eu0yg7n,t1_eu0wyi0,1563357145.0,"I read somewhere that the reason that the tin is not greased because the cake grabs onto the sides of the tin and uses them to rise up. The hole in the tube pan acts as a side as well, and the cake rises evenly. Is there a possibility of having high sides and a sunken middle if I use a normal round pan?"
