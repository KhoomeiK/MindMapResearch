You may have called it, whatever that means. I know odds were stacked against him. I knew it was a long shot. 

Just because it was a long shot doesn’t mean that I wasn’t going to try. 

I knocked on over 1k houses, put in over 100 hours of volunteer time. I donated over 1k. I was invested in this campaign because I believed that with him in office my quality of life and those of my loved ones would improve. 

My mom is a disabled, poor, single mother living in a mold infested trailer in a rural community. She doesn’t deserve that. And Bernie was fighting for her. 

So yes, I’m hurt."

SandersForPresident,fg5wh6z,t1_fg5tsww,1580541806.0,"I was a 20 year old college sophomore when I started following Bernie. Now I’m a 24 year old with a real job. 

Being a working student is not fun and it takes all of your energy. In ‘16 I just voted for him and went to a rally. 

Now that I’m not a student and I have the luxury of free time I can spend all that time organizing for Bernie. 

I work 40-45 hours a week and I still manage to put 20-30 hours a week for Bernie. From hosting door to door events to text banking. I can’t just sit back and believe that he’ll get elected. I need to stand up and knock on some damn doors. 

But on the honest side I’m tired affff. I have a mentally and emotionally draining job, CPS, & I’m over here fighting for justice. Ya girrrrl just wants a break. With that being said on March 3, 2020 you’re going to catch me crying and screaming because all these long hours paid off. 

We can not stop y’all, we’re going to win on Monday, then we’re going to win the nomination and then we’re going to take the White House. 

Let’s get this movement going! We got this. ✊🏾✊🏾"

I’m going to get my grandma to go knock on doors in here little census-designated area community of 800 people.  But thank you people like you make me feel more comfortable doing organizing work. This is my first time taking any leadership role like this so I’m learning and thankfully by a lot of helpful supporters.
SandersForPresident,fe6mwj8,t1_fe6jk5o,1578896411.0,"I definitely should. 

I have a field office within a mile of my residence, but I grew up in a rural community so their well-being is very close to my heart. I started knocking on doors already but it’s only been me and my family members. Which is great I’m glad they’re joining us and four is better than non. But i want more people coming out, i want to get 10 people there or more. I’m posting on all of my social media platforms to get people to join me. So now I’m planning a barnstorm to talk to people who may not know how to support. There are people that don’t feel comfortable with knocking on doors. I want to be strategic and efficient because we need to talk to ALL the people not just some. I’m holding a Barnstorm to try and see if we can get more people out talking to people. The campaign is giving me access to their caller list of people who have signed up to volunteer and that are from the area but the field director hasn’t been to helpful with that part. So that’s why I’m doing recruitment this way too. I’m trying lol wish me luck. 

But thank you so much for the kind words. I’m just trying to do my best to get this man elected. I tell people that this election will determine our whole future. If he doesn’t win I won’t be able to start a family of my own, and I don’t want that. I’ll volunteer all the hours that I need to, to give a better future to my hope to be future kids. As for you, keep doing amazing work friend and thanks for the help!

Edit: And yes we are registering people to vote as well. & telling them about the Census."
