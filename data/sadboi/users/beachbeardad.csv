NoStupidQuestions,fkk2m2p,t3_fizipm,1584270926.0,I keep a small spray bottle with water/soap by the TP and essentially make my own wet wipes since I don‚Äôt like to use the ready made ones to keep paper waste to a minimum. Actually I have never used a bidet and find it very curious and interesting.

bipolar,fg35ooi,t3_ewmygy,1580471362.0,"You have to hang in there and find a way for yourself to deal with it. It sucks and some days will be good(really good) and some days bad(really bad) but all hope is not lost. I have been dealing with bipolar 1 since I was in my teens  and now that I‚Äôm an old dude in his 50‚Äôs, I was just recently diagnosed as bipolar last year. It was a shock but made lots of sense given all my insane mood swings and depression. You can‚Äôt give up and have to fight each and everyday and find what meds/therapy work for YOU. Not gonna lie,its def not easy and more than once I wanted to end it all,but my spouse and dogs keep me going strong. There‚Äôs no secret to keeping level and stable,meds help but sometimes not entirely and they do come with side effects. You have to see what works in your life and talk to your loved ones about it if you can. Not everyone will understand what its like to have this condition and reading about it gives them some insight but not the daily struggle we deal with,especially when there is a stable or normal period or someone says-‚Äòjust snap out of it‚Äô or ‚Äò I know you can control it,but you just don‚Äôt want to‚Äô. Wish I had the magic answer for you but I don‚Äôt and have been looking for it myself. You have to find a way to cope with it via meds/therapy/exercise and try to take back the control of this bastard of a condition. It won‚Äôt ever go away but can be managed if YOU want it to. Good luck to you bud and I hope you find some peace and stability in your life......."

bipolar2,exelhiy,t3_csfjae,1566219146.0,I am BP1 and the only med I currently take is Wellbutrin or bupropion 150mg once a day in morning because of fear of falling into a deep depression like I did in January(really bad and scary)...for me at least...it has not affected the hypo/mania part...my NP therapist said if I take the full 300mg dose it could trigger a full blown mania episode like I had last year when I bought and sold/traded in 3 cars/trucks ...I think each drug will affect each person differently so it‚Äôs all a matter of trial and error...so far I have had minimal side effects except for feeling a bit foggy and less emotionally ‚Äòsad‚Äô and almost flat feeling...Good luck to you and I hope you find something that works....
AskGaybrosOver30,exbpx7n,t3_crzf2x,1566135975.0,"I‚Äôm kind of in the same situation myself...my spouse is 77 and I‚Äôm 54...we met when I was 37 and have been together for 17yrs and got legally married 4 yrs ago....I am the one who takes care of the house ,gardening, repairs etc. but he can cook like a chef and pays for @60% of household finances,so it‚Äôs a fair and balanced way for us...plus we just love being around each other,and laugh at our corny jokes,love to go antiquing and really enjoy each other‚Äôs company...of course there are differences but we acknowledge that and try to find some similarities......we always have had a very healthy sex life and even did a few 3somes together for some added excitement. In the last 5 yrs he has slowed down a lot and recognizes it and told me that he has no problem with me having hookups on occasion and just to be honest and safe and let him know(he loves to hear the details). We are very open and honest with each other and I am and will be loyal and loving to this man until I die. I tried doing the hookup thing a few times and although the sex was great and exciting, I found that they needed and wanted that emotional connection which I had to resist in fear of getting ‚Äòconnected ‚Äò myself. It‚Äôs not so easy for me at least to have unemotional sex with someone since I feel it forms a bond with that person and if the other person feels that too, it can get complex. There is no easy answer for this...I too got emotionally hooked to someone for a few months and I felt like I was ‚Äúcheating‚Äù on my spouse even though he gave me the go ahead(I had to break off the relationship w/my fb). Jerking off helps me a lot and using a fleshlight is another layer and since I love to bike and hike(my spouse can‚Äôt really do heavy physical activity),I go hiking in the woods,smoke a doobie and jerk off. My first priority and loyalty is to my husband since I made a vow to him and married him because why get married if you won‚Äôt be loyal both emotionally and spiritually. I make no judgements on anyone because human relationships are complex and sometimes we need to be adult about things and make sacrifices for the ones we love. Sorry for the long winded response, but I hope you find your peace and are able to be emotionally grounded in the choices you make. Sound like you have great relationship with your partner and hope that is a guide for the future.  Peace and strong roads ahead for you......."

bipolar,evg380j,t3_cjsp4g,1564505142.0,I give all of you big props for even taking it in the first place; I won‚Äôt take any mood stabilizer for fear of the horrible side effects....lamictal scares the bejeezus out of me and Wellbutrin is the only so called ‚Äòmed‚Äô I will take...def not easy esp with bp1 but I am dealing with it..
bipolar,eudo3lq,t3_cfz55z,1563723009.0,This is an excellent observation that only BP people can understand. Even my spouse doesn‚Äôt get it and thinks I am just ‚Äòpretending‚Äô sometimes because most of the time I am always in super active mode. I feel like a emotional hurricane that lands occasionally to collect more stuff.....
