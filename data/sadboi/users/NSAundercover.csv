schizophrenia,euf4gk4,t3_cg4c6n,1563762286.0,"I think we are all creative artists no matter what we practice. 

Art is about emotion and emotions are artistic revelations. Some of us can draw, paint, sing, etc. Many can enlighten others through love, mercy, forgiveness. As if they were artists (because they are) so why should we limit our thinking of creative art to something so small as a picture or a song? afterall, they are only drawn/sung to elicit emotion from the viewer. The best artists are those in pain and by expressing their form of art they get a better understanding of themselves and their pain. We are all artists when we practice virtuous traits like compassion, love, mercy and forgiveness.  Epictetus says ""small minded people blame each other, average people blame themselves, the wise see all blame as foolish"" so forgive others, forgive yourself, and accept that you are fallible so that you can progress to be an artist in whatever your heart desires. progress in life is a road that is built brick by brick with thoughtless good deeds for others and working on your faults."
