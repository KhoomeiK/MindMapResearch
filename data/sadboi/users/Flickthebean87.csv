I used to give guys too much of a chance. I would ignore red flags and would dig up the smallest shred of “good.” Now I’m just hesitant. I know exactly what I want. I just need more work on myself. I’m trying to develop healthy patterns and relationships. I just don’t want to get completely consumed by someone. Hoping to get my stuff back together in 2 years I hope.

You don’t have to talk to someone everyday. I like space, so I sprinkle my interactions throughout a week. That way you still get the right amount of balance. 

Take things about the people you know as they are. Don’t try to go and wonder “If I do xyz will they be mad?” Or “Do they think xyz because I did xyz?” Not sure if you overthink, but if you do it’s helpful to let it go. I used to overthink interactions to the point I would work myself up over nothing.

They are all great. I just get really burnt out, my anxiety gets bad if I don’t get time to myself and back in my environment. 

I actually like being social. I get along well with just about anyone that’s not an asshole. I enjoy helping and talking to people. I just can’t be social for long periods of time. That hasn’t been hard to explain to friends as I’ve had most for the last 10 years. 

For me though I need a balance. I do need time with people or mentally I start declining. I start to feel caged and stir crazy after being isolated for a bit. I hardly have any family. Only my dad is in the state I’m in. 

As for your friends I went through several “chapters” of my life without them. It doesn’t mean they aren’t your friends and you lost them. Dynamics change constantly. 

As for finding someone it’s been hard. I used dating apps for about 12 years off and on. My choices were horrible though. 

I’ve had a hard time finding what I look for because everyone seems so one way or the other. I’m a very in the “middle” type of person. I either talk to dudes that want to talk to everyone they see or end up with ones that never want to leave the house. I need one in the middle of that."
loseit,fqog93k,t3_gjv442,1589514556.0,"I’ve noticed this trend anytime a woman loses weight. Women get jealous. Instead of working hard to lose the weight, it’s easier to be cruel to some “random” person. They get mad also because of not being able to “relate” to the person. 

I also noticed it when I started losing weight. I would hear crazy shit. “I like food a lot.” Yeah so do I. I noticed it a lot more too when my friends gained weight. “Oh it happens as you age. You just won’t have a nice body anymore.” The majority of my friends won’t work out and won’t change their eating habits. I think people fear you won’t relate to them or fit in with them anymore.

Younger people seek answers from older people. When the world has changed. It’s no longer the world they grew up in. I was told to get a job and it didn’t matter “what” because college was the ticket. I also had no choice bc I needed to support myself. It was your golden ticket to not be poor like your parents. (At least that’s what my parents thought for awhile). So many assumptions are thrown around. I see a lot of the same mindset with my friends. A lot of us haven’t had very clear guidance. We all have great dads who worked hard. 

A lot of people don’t put two and two together. I had a friend so jealous over another friend. Prior to her becoming a nurse she always went on vacations.

My last ex I tried to be reasonable with. He had just got out of the military. He went straight in at 18. He seemed to have a lot of issues adjusting. He sat and played video games our entire relationship. 

Looking back it wasn’t the housework, chores, lack of emotional, physical, and sexual help I got. It was the fact he didn’t put effort into anything at all. Nothing in his life. It translated to being used and he was a very selfish person. 

I know with my two long terms I overcompensated and starting out doing elaborate things. Cooking home made meals, but other than that expectations were laid out. Get a job, Keep a job, split bills, clean up after yourself. No that ended in him quitting a job randomly and making me pay bills for 4 months. I stayed too long, but it was also verbally abusive. 

My hope was they would mirror my behavior and do things for me also. Nope. I think it was misunderstood as they had no responsibilities. I had to start doing some things though or they wouldn’t get done at all.

The only thing I can say is using video chat is positive. You can see if you click and would enjoy someone’s company in person. You can form good emotional bonds maybe.

Now I can tell if someone is faking an amazing life. They normally try too hard to impress others. People who are truly happy don’t need an audience. With that said though a lot of us want to be valued and liked. 

For me I have changed a lot. I used to judge people for being in situations. I was so naive. Some people truly will not try to improve their life and will always play victim. Most people in a bad situation are mentally or physically stuck. People also don’t realize that could happen to them. 

I’m a lot more empathetic, but yes also wary. When I was younger (I still struggle at times) I used to assume everyone had the same heart as me. So now I stay on the fence. 

I just try to look at everyone as humans. Most of our end goals are the same. We want to be loved, provide for our families, we want our friends to like us. We are all flawed, make mistakes, and that’s ok."

You know when you are in a car that’s stuck in the mud? You push on the gas and mindlessly try to go. Mud is spinning and you are just going deeper and not getting out. Same with mental health. It creates more of a mess to push it aside. I know it’s hard because bills don’t stop, but you will get farther in the long run. 

I literally went in a circle for about 10 years working very shit jobs because I had a lot of trauma. I wasn’t able to start moving forward until I addressed, worked on, and “fixed” (best I can) the issues."

aspergers,fnxi21k,t3_g45j1a,1587339065.0,"I don’t like extreme cold or hot weather. 

I also love rain, but hate going out in it. I can’t stand having the bottoms of my pants wet. 

I overheat really easy and I’ll pass out. Maybe my body temperature running lower than normal? 

If I wake up hot I’ll be pissed."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fnuccnl,t1_fntlfi8,1587259011.0,Yeah we had protesting in Kentucky while our governor read off the numbers of people who had passed. It was so loud you could barely hear him talk. He maintained his composure though. Now they have to protest from their cars.
AskReddit,fnsz93s,t3_g3iija,1587231614.0,A T-Rex skeleton model. I found it in a vacant unit when I was a housekeeper. I’m a 32 female.
AskWomenOver30,fnsyi4p,t3_g3odbt,1587231212.0,"In my 20’s I was a total wreck. Up until about 32. I had severe anxiety issues, depression, various bad habits and issues. 

I still feel at 32 things are a wreck. Not a complete disaster like it was, but still bad. 

In the last 2 years I left an abusive relationship. I Dropped 32 lbs, regulated my fkd hormones, quit smoking cigs, started replacing clothes, worked on my credit, personality flaws, changed my diet, toned, got hobbies, fixed a lot of my mental health, grew hair back, and gained back 21 lbs (working on that again). Built up great self esteem. Been saving for an suv. Downsized a lot of my stuff by going through it. I will say I was a completely different person now than I was in almost every aspect. 

I don’t have a set career, live with my dad bc I can’t afford a place alone, and still need a car. I have severe driving anxiety that I have to get over. My mental state is finally stabilized for the last 2 years. I have a great dad, but one who financially can’t help. Same with my other family. So it’s very hard to try and pull yourself out. (All my friend’s have had some financial help) I feel I’ve been fighting to do that for 10 years now. 

I was someone who used to want kids and a husband. Then I switched to wanting to be career focused. Yeah I don’t fit into the “career driven” or stay at home house wife thing. My goals have changed. 

Financially I am trying to find a good career with little debt. I’m trying to find something where I don’t work my life away. So it’s taking me forever. I don’t want to be in this pay range forever, but also don’t want to have to pay on something forever either. 

You will be able to accomplish more once your mental health is healthy. I’m still not there with the life aspects. I can relate though. It makes dating hard."

Once you build muscle, drop weight, and get stronger it makes activities easier. Don’t see a reason why you couldn’t try it out."
AskWomenOver30,fnhtxi1,t1_fnfwkva,1586968785.0,I think that can be true. I think a lot of it in my case is from conditioning as a kid.
AskWomenOver30,fnfmmvw,t1_fnfmcnw,1586911085.0,I’m sorry to hear you went through the same thing as a kid. Also glad that we can relate though. It’s really freeing to finally let go and take control back.

TheOriginals,fnfgu48,t1_fnfdi3r,1586907784.0,"I think it’s more she had him “first” type thing. 

I like them both together. I think Klaus had more of a “relationship” with Cami though."
AskWomenOver30,fnfg0z5,t3_g1f5g8,1586907346.0,"I think some people have the need to be productive. If they aren’t doing something “useful” I think they feel like they aren’t doing the right thing. Or they feel like a pos. Sort of like the sentiment you hear when you’re single “enjoy your life and don’t worry about finding the one.” 

I used to be like this. Rushing to the next thing. Except you never get there and it causes you to rush through life. People would sit and tell me what I needed to do. When younger, I was made to “look around and see what needs to be done.” I feel a lot of this stems from being in a family who constantly moves. I had to separate myself and let myself be ok without having to do something. I was often made to feel like I was lazy because I didn’t want to constantly do “adult” bs. 

I’ve even heard this from friends that have kids. They ask what I’m doing, get mad/annoyed/jealous that I’m not doing anything, then guilt trip me. A lot of people see unproductive behaviors as lazy. “Must be nice to do xyz. If I was you I would do xyz.” It took me quite awhile to rewire my brain to know the difference between lazy and just relaxing. 

Might not be what you are looking for. I used to have a very structured life and finally wore myself out wanting to relax."
PCOS,fnfe4rp,t3_g1ehtw,1586906329.0,"It’s probably going to vary depending on the person. 

My experience is I started in July 2017 weighing 198. I started on Ovasitol and got regular periods at around 175. Idk if weight loss was what did it though. My body just doesn’t function correctly. I even missed periods on birth control pills, and my periods have been fkd since I quit smoking cigs. Even at a lower weight."

Holding a fish, deer head, Camo, hunting. 

I’m a country boy. 

Thug life, school of hard knocks, or any form of education: The streets. 

Major spelling and grammar mistakes. 

Outdoors, craft beer, pizza/tacos. Nothing wrong with liking that. That’s just a very generic profile. 

This eliminates about 80 percent of profiles in my area. At least it did last time I online dated a few years ago. 

I guess I’m the unicorn. As I typically swipe left on dudes for being OVER 6’0. I’m 5’2 and don’t want a tall guy."
