So I have dead mother names. Thing is, my mother is first generation Irish/Scottish and very VERY anglophone. My father is French Canadian and didn't learn to speak English until he was 30. 

I grew up in Very Francophone Quebec. Not just ""not anglo friendly"", but ""actively anglo hostile"" Quebec. 

My mother butchered my grandmother's french first name into a spelling that sounded like a boy's name, and then my middle name was JEAN, for her mother. That's JOHN, to Francophones. 

I started spelling both my names with an extra n and e at the end informally for years, and had them both legally changed before I got married and had my first child so that my marriage/her birth certificates would have the right spelling. 

So anyways, that's why my middle name is Jeanne. Because my mother is an asshole and I'm not letting that shit fly. She hates that I did it, and I give zero fucks."

It could start a fucking war at worst. We've seen this happen with Trump trying to bully us (I'm Canadian and while I like a baguette and speak French, I also speak English as do many of the sympathetic Europeans you mention) with those kinds of tariffs for his own political issues. You can't just demand something like health care reform of another country, certainly not by bullying them and hurting our own citizens. It isn't done because it isn't a viable or ethical option for many reasons. It's dangerous enough both in a political sense and in a very real world people-are-gonna-suffer for this sense to interfere in shit like genocides, human rights violations, and eco destruction. There's no fucking way we can come out swinging on something like YOUR country's health care. How you don't understand that is entirely beyond me. 

Also... My dude it's your country, not ours. Acting the way you are is just... I've never seen anyone so angry at people who don't even live, and can't vote in your country about something like this.

Now, we live in Canada and while my husband and I had smoked pot and done psychedelics when we were teens (and he was a young adult, I quit doing any drugs when I was 19) we never did anything like that during our 13 years together until about last year. We started dabbling casually when it became legal and accessible. I have an anxiety disorder and he is the sole provider for a family of four - that shit is AMAZING to help us wind down, help us sleep. Sure we'll take a toke and like, watch a silly movie or go walk the dog and relax but we don't get impaired around the kids and we don't fucking smoke right around them. My daughter knows what ""whacky tobaccy"" is, she's 11 and she's walked in on me using a vape pen so we've explained hey - this is legal, were adults, we're being responsible, and we take this medicinally to help us sleep. It's not for kids and it's like alcohol you don't do this until your brain is matured. She's 11. K? Me, at 11? I had heard tons of stories about my mother's SO MUCH FUN!!! times smoking pot, baking hash brownies, getting drunk etc etc when she was young. She made it seem so cool and fun and my dad had his reeling drunk and high friends over all the fucking time - he'd smoke away from us but didn't hide it well and they'd be totally impaired when they got together - once I went camping with him and his friends and they got stoned as fuck around the campfire, drank a couple bottles of hard liquor and my dad puked and passed out in our tent and didn't notice that the thing was too close to the lake and my sleeping bag got soaked. He had me drinking liquor with him and his friends when I was 13 and by the time I was 14 we were buying weed for each other and timing it up at the table around my mother and younger bro. And no. It wasn't the cool positive experience I thought it was at the time. They gave me their approval when I did this stuff. Not just approval in the sense that they allowed it but approval in the sense that they were proud. 

I don't treat my kid like my friend or my confidante. My daughter and I have coffee dates sure but they're Mum and Daughter dates and we draw and talk about school and plan birthday parties. My son and I have our own things too but they revolve around pokémon and nature facts, not how much fun it was to party and get fucked up with my friends. 

Coming from a really fucked up family there are a lot of things I did as a parent that I had to unlearn because I didn't understand why they were wrong or because I was fucking triggered by normal child behaviour. I got help and am still working on myself, but that glorifying of drug shit and confiding on my kids as if they were my friends is something I always consciously and instinctually knew I would never do. Those lines were blurry and always shifting for me and it was absolutely not a stable or positive thing to grow up with."

BUTTER CHICKEN. Make a whole big batch of the chicken and gravy the day before (it's easy, there are lots of customisable recipes to find and it tastes even better the second day). You can also throw together some dough and let it sit in the fridge over night - also tastes better with a longer rest! The day of you can cook some fresh basmati rice - maybe an extra pot of coconut rice! - and roll out the naan and serve fresh while people serve themselves from a crock pot or instant pot of warmed butter chicken. Look up various toppings and have them available buffet style - cilantro, green onions, hot sauce, yogurt, etc. - and then pile up the warm naan in a foil lined casserole. 

That's an easy and cool meal in my opinion as a home cook, and it's something I would love to be served at someone's house.

The last time she came to stay with us a few years ago I had to finally tell her to stop, it was pissing everyone off. Then she got annoyed with me. 1.They would NEVER tolerate that behaviour from me or my children - she and my father have told me off for it even in MY own home and 2. She somehow manages to never do that around anyone else, never mind on the phone with them. Fucking ridiculous."
AskReddit,fmmhwu6,t3_fw16de,1586205572.0,"I grew up in an abusive household - physically and emotionally and mentally abusive narcissistic alcoholic father and an enabler and gaslighter of a mother, both of whom dealt with drug addiction in different ways - and then quit school and moved out and in with a 24 year old woman when I was 16 who basically groomed me and we were together romantically for 3 years during which she physically and mentally abused the FUCK out of me. I was a 16 year old girl with legit mental health issues and she used that shit against me like crazy. She was also Mormon and closeted - and I also suspect that she's trans or at least gender fluid and had TONS of issues that she made my issues because of her religion. It was so very very not ok for a bi-sexual kid just figuring their shit out and I STILL have issues because of that. And I grieve. 

Two things made me realize both situations were fucked. First of all, I became a parent and as my children grew up I realized that FUCK NO none of that was ok - and I had to deal and STILL deal with a lot of my own issues on that end - and second of all, my husband is incredibly kind and loving to me and that's NORMAL. It took me a long time to realize it was NORMAL. He doesn't insult me, he doesn't hit me, he LIKES me, if something he does hurts of scares me I can tell him and *he will stop*. And... his face. When I started telling him about some of the things my family has done. I'm still afraid to remind him to turn off at certain spots if I think he's forgotten the turn (or NOT to say something), and if he moves abruptly or yells or hell, even shaves his fucking beard off I get scared. It took me a long time to realize that THAT wasn't normal either. He's NEVER in 13 years hurt me on purpose and I still get scared because it's so ingrained.  

It was because my husband loves me so much and because I love my children so much that I realized. There's a lot of grief and anger that I have yet to resolve - maybe won't ever resolve - but I am trying to be better than they were, at least.

Also... my father started getting abusive with my daughter the way he did with me when she was 4-7 years old. She's 11 now and he hasn't seen her in 4 years this past February and that's how I""m going to keep it. Also also, when I turned 24, the age my girlfriend was when she found me at my HIGHSCHOOL BAND PRACTICE, I was nursing my 2 year old daughter and my 16 year old neighbour had just come over to chat with me about her boy troubles and how she was applying for a vet tech internship and I remember thinking... oh my god, how FUCKED do you have to be to be and adult and going for a CHILD the way she did to me? It's just... when you grow up in toxic fucked up situations, your whole sense of reality and normalcy just... isn't there. It's not developed."

We loved our cats but we were poor and they were ignorant - the cats went outside both in our down town neighbourhood and in rural ones. They infested our house with fleas, got hurt or killed by cars or coyotes or raptor birds - nightmare. One cat had a pregnancy that ended in her leaving still born kittens all over the fucking house and getting very very sick from the failed pregnancy - then got pregnant again a few months later and went kinda nuts and couldn't care for the kittens. 

So all that is gross I know but... Man. I also remember helping those cats give birth at age 9 and 10 and nursing the babies when I was 13 or so. Later on they had a bear dog who had puppies and it was amazing - for us, anyways. That dog was a sweetie and so good but clearly didn't want to be a parent.

Anyways. I just know sparing is just what you do but I also feel a bit bummed that my kids won't have the experiences like I did. Newborn pups and kits are so fucking awesome. 

Though my goofy girl would probably have no clue about mothering and our weird little rescue dog would probably eat them because he's a gremlin..."
