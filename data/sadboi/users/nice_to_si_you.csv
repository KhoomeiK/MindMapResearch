CPTSD,f7eq545,t3_dvjnvy,1573663358.0,"I've made three attempts at college. The last try was really solid. I was on the dean's list in a hard science major, learning tons, and really enjoying myself. I almost finished, and the school even offered to pay for what I had left. But life got crazy, and I couldn't juggle it with everything else. I completely fell apart, and I still haven't gotten completely back up. 

I'm pretty sure I won't be going back to school. I'm not sure when I'll be able to work again. Fortunately, I'm not in a position that I have to anytime soon. But it really sucks that I got that close. 

These days, I try not to dwell on it too much. I'm trying to get to place where I believe in my intrinsic worth, outside of my accomplishments. That goal has been more elusive than I'd like, but it seems like the right place to be headed."
LifeAfterNarcissism,f010jee,t1_f00m8bu,1568308975.0,The constant devil's advocate is exhausting. It's a way of constantly reminding you that your ideas don't matter as much as their ideas.

NarcissisticAbuse,ezuj78u,t3_d2fa1m,1568153421.0,"A tendency towards introspection and a willingness to consider one's part in a conflict is a sign of a healthy mind. I think it's totally natural to wonder what you could be doing better. In normal, healthy life, that's how people improve themselves and their relationships.

In an unhealthy relationship, the tendency is more towards, ""What can I do better next time so he/she won't get so upset with me?"""
LifeAfterNarcissism,ey3zfqz,t1_ey3sghs,1566777789.0,"Read this slowly: My post is *not* about you. It is about a phrase that *anyone* could use, narcissist or not. 

If you don't believe what I'm saying, fine. That's not about me."
LifeAfterNarcissism,ey2wf7j,t1_ey1dlvx,1566749846.0,"I wasn't even talking about *you*. Read my answer again. Try to see where I said that your experience wasn't real or or in any way invalidated your feelings. I told you what has happened to *me*, whereupon you:

* Jumped straight to calling me a narcissist in spite of knowing practically nothing about me. 
* Insinuated that I had an ulterior motive for sharing a personal story, i.e., tried to tell me what I was thinking.
* Tried to get off the hook for saying something patently offensive by saying ""no offense"". 

Funny thing is, that might have actually worked on me in the past. Not anymore. I don't put up with that kind of disrespect from the people closest to me. I certainly have no reason to tolerate it coming from a absolute stranger with a hair trigger and a chip on their shoulder.

Next time before lashing out, maybe take a minute to consider that the messages you're responding to are from actual people. Next time, take a breath before hitting ""save"" and think about how you'd feel on the receiving end of your message. 

Last of all, if the way you just reacted to me is at all like the relationship you have with your father, it might be time for a little introspection. It has been my experience that people who are willing to act in the way you just did under the cloak of anonymity or towards strangers in public probably ought not to consider themselves completely blameless when they find others to be difficult."
LifeAfterNarcissism,ey0bthn,t1_exxnzoc,1566676979.0,"The religion in which I was raised (and thankfully dumped) almost expressly forbids getting angry with other people. ""Contention is of the devil."" My parents would constantly use that phrase to shut me down when they thought I was a little ""too"" upset. It didn't apply to them apparently."
LifeAfterNarcissism,ey0bgyp,t1_exy33ns,1566676831.0,"Be careful with that answer as a gold standard. My SO says almost exactly this to me as a way of showing that if she can get along with everyone else, then there must be something wrong with *me*. But she accepts little to no responsibility for the difficulties we're having. She can go for days without talking to me in any meaningful way.

I recently confided to my therapist that I was concerned that *I* might be the narcissist. She actually laughed! Then she told me that I shouldn't worry at all. I'm absolutely one of the least narcissistic people she's ever known. What a relief! Even with that, I still get little twinges of worry. I guess that's just more evidence supporting what she said. 

One thing that narcissists are very good at is presenting a charming public face. They might ""get along"" with people at work while in private, they're crushing the people they're closest to."

There's some comfort in knowing I'm not the only one who's experienced this. As for me, I don't know what the final chapter will look like, or when it will happen.

NarcissisticAbuse,es1gzmf,t1_erytd80,1561496596.0,"I've been keeping a list like this as a spreadsheet for the last several years. I didn't really expect to keep doing it as long as I did. Not long ago, I reformatted the whole thing in a Word document to make it easier to read. I was shocked to discover that it was over **80 pages long**, and that didn't even count all of the times I've written in my journal by hand. 

What's craziest, is that I started it out trying to figure out what I was doing wrong so I could heal the relationship. And I'm *still* agonizing over every shitty interaction and straining to see if maybe I could have prevented it from happening. My SO calls or texts, sounding completely happy and friendly, and I scream to myself, ""WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME???""

Sammy's is closed. She's pissed at you for it, whether it makes sense or not.
