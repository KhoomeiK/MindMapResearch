Personally, I'm saying her grand total ability/passive/ultimate worth, when compared to most other legends, is subpar. Situational she is good, as with every other legend; however she essentially doesn't have a passive AND she takes bonus damage. I was giving the comp situation because people continue bringing up competitive to excuse the fact that her passive was made to allow 3 ults, before they limited it.

Her ult can also be used by enemies. If they force you to leave, it goes from being useful to sabotaging. +in a 1v3 situation, you also take more damage..."

Octane's ability isn't really that good but his passive is incredible. I've seen and played with really good octane players, that character moreso depends on your style of play.

Watson is litterally horrible and theres no different playstyle to make her abilities match though of others, she essentially doesn't have a passive and takes more damage. Also decent enemy players can easily steal your ult and use it for themselves. She can block paths, but any decent player can just climb over her fences, break them, or use them for their own protection."

As a side note: Quickly getting off of meds (antidepressants, or mood stabalizers, or etc) isn't good for you in the long run. You should spend atleast a week weaning yourself off/onto a perscribed dosage (doctors usually make people take a month in between dosage increases). Make sure to always take them when perscribed (ie: the same time EVERY time, unless told otherwise). NEVER consume ANY other street drugs/alchohol while they are in your blood; that actually does lead to sociopathic/narcissistic/lack-of-impulse-control/self-harming tendencies, as well as behavioral/personality changes that last months after. You can't even have grapefruit, it is a pain, but good for you to avoid these things altogether. (Alchohol with things like Ibuprofen also has serious permanent side effects)

After being perscribed antidepressants, I was told by my doctor I could drink while on them. I didn't trust him so I looked into it; do not drink ANY alchohol, not even 1/4 a cup of beer. There are COUNTLESS police reports and anotated experiences and etc of mania and alchohol dependency from mixing ethanol with mind altering medications, for the vast majority of those mixing them. It litterally has permanent or long-term side effects! Long story short, I got my doctor removed/suspended/fired for malpractice. Consult a pharmacist about drug interactions or go to a trusted site to see the documented side effects.

Medication is not something to take lightly, be vigilant.

depression,fkqcr5g,t3_fk2t94,1584440662.0,"I'm going to be completely straightforward with you...

Two wrongs don't make a right.

People usually don't say someone is cruel/etc if the person isn't being apathetic towards another's feelings. Self improvement is always beneficial. BUT if the person is clearly attempting abusive maneuvers and fabricating/twisting truths, then that is wrong of them, not you.

Try to look at everything from an outside perspective; are you doing things to hurt the feelings of others? If so try your best to not hurt their feelings, because that isn't okay. Apologize if need be. How would you feel in their shoes? It isn't right to overlook, belittle, or denounce how someone else feels. Everyone has the right to their own feelings.

At the same time, her gaslighting you, turning others against you (instead of dealing with the situation assertively, in an appropriate manner), guilt tripping you, and essentially trying to manipulate you to bend to her will isn't okay either.

The best and only successful remedy to this situation is -awareness-, after assertive confrontation with patience/understanding/care/empathy/honesty failed in the past (while both participants were in their right headspace).
If you are aware of her bulls*** tactics that you listed, then they won't get to you. If someone believes her distortions, confront the person she lied to and be honest with them; tell them it hurts when they spread rumors about you, tell them how you feel from everything.

I've met mothers who are emotionally/verbally/mentally abusive to their children before and it isn't okay. Please do your best to stay afloat and cut her out of your life if necessary.

No one is entitled to anything except their own choices and feelings; not her, not you, not me, no one. That being said, always try your best and if a situation makes you uncomfortable, do your best to make it habitable to you and if you can't, don't even bother wasting your time/energy.

It is literally that simple. Look at people who fight and compare their intelligence and problem solving skills to a person who doesn't. Brutish and unethical if you ask me. Agitation in itself is a sign of stupidity and a lack of patience. Be better than that."

That therapist acted like a highschool math teacher, recommending me things to try when I go home and trying to reschedule visits. She kept trying to force and pry thoughts into my head, like I was hiding stuff, but I was just indifferent so that interaction turned out to be pointless.

When I was older I had a therapist who was a free spirited hippie lady who introduced me to immersion tactics, breathing exercises, and mental imagery to reduce my claustrophobia/agoraphobia/anxiety (but it honestly didn't do anything for reducing the severity of my issues), however, talking to her about stuff lead me to a deeper understanding of my mental struggles and helped me understand + accept myself for who I am. She was very nice and how she intook information then responded was very pleasant and welcoming.

I believe every therapist is different, just like every human being is different.

depression,fjxctmy,t1_fjxahe6,1583668042.0,"...this response and your others are very worrisome...

I don't intend this as an insult, but this situation isn't okay.

Please don't ignore how serious this is. Losing yourself is a fate far worse than death. Alchohol and all other drugs will SERIOUSLY harm your sanity (just alchohol with ibuprofen can cause irreparable stomach issues, I'm unsure of WHY people think mixing it with medication that affects your brain is safe). You also need to be wary of things like grapefruit and St.Johns Wart. Cocaine alone causes permanent behavioral changes, similar to the effects of bipolar disorder.

I got my doctor fired for malpractice for telling me I could drink with my antidepressants. Ive also had +14 websites removed for promoting the combination. Everyone I've ever met who mixed the two destroyd their life, ended up in a psych ward, or in jail. Thousands of police reports will back my claim.

My ex finally sobered up, but sadly the things that she did are now part of reality. Now she, and everyone else, has to live with it, because that is life. Everyone I've encountered who mixed medications with other things like this described it as a ""nightmare you can't wake up from, where you watch someone else control your actions"".

If you want to get better, to be blunt and straight to the point; you need to tell people around you that have a problem. If your friends still encourage you to drink/do-other-drugs with them, they aren't your friends. Same goes for family members. If they still enable you to harm yourself in this way, sever them from your life.

If you are currently on medication, it will make quitting other drugs nearly impossible. Alchohol/drug dependency goes hand in hand with mixing either with antidepressants OR mood stabilizers, along with the near psychosis. It is never okay to mix either with alchohol. Take care of yourself and don't harm yourself anymore.

Things can ALWAYS get worse, if nothing happens things will get worse. Get some help.

I apologize if I am coming across as rude or etc, but this isn't something to take lightly. I suffered from YEARS of emotional/verbal/mental abuse and I now have crippling depression, agorophobia, and near PTSD from everything I've been through ontop of my nervous ticks and anxiety (which stops me from talking/eating for days at a time) because of something so stupid and trivial (such as ""one drink"" with friends).

Alchohol and recreational drugs litterally destroyed my life and my entire future. I wasn't even the one taking them. Even one sip of alchohol is too much and will most-likely result in dependency. While taking antidepressants, I had half a kombucha and I could feel myself losing hold of my mind; I felt disoriented for a week.

Its far easier to whither a flower than it is to grow one. Take care of yourself and don't hurt anyone else.

I'm sorry but seeing you approach something like this with a ""I'll try, but no promises"" approach is making me relive litteral  hell. There's no ""some days"" or ""break time"" while fighting addiction; that's called a relapse.

I understand you are a stranger, but please take care of yourself and get off medication if you are struggling to fight the use of other drugs or go to rehab. There is nothing I could've done, but there is something she could've done, there is something you can do. Be aware.

Ignorance only hurts others. Knowledge and honesty are true freedom.

(I'm sorry, I can't respond to this. Seeing you openly say you are struggling from mood change and identity change while also stating you drink, but aren't actually doing things about quitting, fills my mind with past events and all the horrible abusive things I went through. I've no negative views of you or anger or etc, I only hope for the best. Please ACTUALLY get better, it is solely on your shoulders, if you love the person you say you love, change back to yourself for him if not you.)"

depression,fjn0lnz,t3_febhu0,1583493232.0,"My advice:
Never forget things that hurt you; keep the pain close to help you grow and build who you are. Forgive yourself and try to better understand everything. If you forget/ignore things, you may be less likely to avoid the reoccurring events in the future, causing more harm to yourself. No one is perfect. No one has a clean slate. Respect yourself and do your best to not hurt others who don't deserve to be hurt. Always do your best, for you. Try to make yourself happy and think about the longterm reaction of all your actions and how they will make you feel at the end of the day/month/week/year/etc. Embrace your opinions and views, stand beside them.

All that being said, removing social media is a good idea to rest your mind and halting your communication with friends is also good (if your friends are negative influences and always want to drink or do drugs or do things which upset you).

Your value is determined by your actions. Your actions show who you are as a person. If you do your best and try your hardest, no matter how many people attack you, you'll know that you are making a positive impact on the world; can they say the same?

depression,fjmyno4,t1_fjmy4w0,1583490608.0,"TO YOU IT IS NOT BAD. To him he clearly has a problem with his actions. Both opinions are fine, but going against yourself and how you feel is not. Forcing an opinion onto someone else is not okay either.

Not everyone is like you. I'm not like you. The OP isn't like you. I'm not like the OP. Everyone is different. Everyone has the right to their own opinion.

Personally, I see this stuff as wrong, morally speaking, so I can understand his standpoint and why he is upset with himself. But he also needs to be aware that he can always forgive himself and make right of his wrongs, learning from his mistakes. If he ignores his regrets, it will damage him and others severely over time (through reoccuring acts, sociopathic tendencies, disassociation, self-harm, or etc).

+ FYI: actual Catholic views are against premarital sex, paying for sex and temporary pleasure, and using others for sexual desires.

(I'm not even religious. We are on r/depression, where people come when they feel they need help. It means a lot to the people here to have SOMEONE or ANYONE listen and respond accordingly.
