Type1Diabetes,fpv753p,t3_gfn22x,1588937167.0,"My lowest was 1.2 mmol/l, so around 21 mg/dl.
I just came home from school after biking 10 minutes and I felt like I was walking on the moon. Other than that I didn't feel anything, but I decided to test my BG and I had to do it a second time because I didn't believe my tester. When I realised I was really that low I just ate everything I could find and laid on the couch for 30min. When my bloodsugar started to go up again to around 4 mmol/l (70 mg/dl) I felt like I was going to die.
I was 16 and home alone, pretty scary."

Saved me a couple times when I didn't have any test strips left (chaotic me, oops), but I wouldn't recommemd if you don't have to haha."
BPD,flki506,t3_fp51l3,1585241365.0,"This is EXACLY how I have been feeling the last couple of weeks. The world finally gets to experience what I experience every single day. Since the covid-19 outbreak I feel like I gues ""normal"" people would feel haha. My mom doesn't understand how this whole thing doesn't seem to affect me, even though I'm diabetic. People seem to feel lost so I feel a little less lost, it's nice."
