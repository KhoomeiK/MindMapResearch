NintendoSwitch,fmpaokz,t3_fwik4i,1586277501.0,"Hi! I had originally just created an account a while ago on my husband's switch to play on his, but I got my own yesterday to play Animal Crossing and transferred my profile over. My switch lite is registered as my primary console and there is no longer a profile for me at all on my husband's switch, but I still can't change my user icon or name. I do, but it will not save when I go back to the main menu. Is there a solution to this?"
CSFLeaks,ffmcsvq,t3_etzyut,1580052528.0,"I have a case very similar to yours. My nose would run out of one side for years, but would be triggered more by eating, or with exercise. I started seeing a new chiropractor last year and after a few visits I started developing some really awful symptoms that I hadn't had before. Bad migraines, high pressure, dizziness, chronic fatigue... Was finally diagnosed with my leak in October and had surgery in November. I'm still recovering and waiting to see if it worked or not or if I need any further treatment."

I did use spray bottles and yelled, but also when they were little and started scratching on something they weren't supposed to I'd pick them up and take them to the scratching part and show them where they were allowed to scratch. They learned. Have three cats that I've had since they were kittens and all furniture completely intact."

EatingDisorders,ep6t0s5,t3_bts0ve,1559073205.0,"Coming from just my personal experience, fitness really helped change my relationship with food. When I started crossfitting and lifting, I wanted to get stronger because my body felt so much better, and I began to see food as the fuel and energy my body needed in order to kick ass and feel great. In the beginning I counted calories and macros, but then I stopped caring about meeting certain numbers and my weight and more about how my body was feeling and the energy I had. I learned to eat intuitively for fuel, and although I worked out 5-6 days a week, it wasn't obsessive for me. It was just something I genuinely enjoyed and made me feel good. If I missed a day or had to take a week off it's fine, I don't need to get restrictive. My muscle memory will pick it back up when my body is ready again. I got excited about eating enough and fueling my body and being healthy. Mind you I do stick too a mainly clean diet and avoid certain foods due to intolerances and allergies and how some make me feel foggy and tired, and generally try to stay away from some foods I used to binge on, but I'm not highly restrictive and will indulge myself some treats at a party and not feel bad and ashamed about it. The disease is still there trying to drag me down always, it's mostly am emotional battle for me and every once in a while depression and anxiety will make me want to use ED behaviors to cope, but with fitness it makes it easier for me to not revert to them because I realize I want to be strong and feel healthy, and exercise helps with endorphins. Being healthy makes me feel happy."
