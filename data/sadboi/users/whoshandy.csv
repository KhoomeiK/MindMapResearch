cscareerquestions,fb9ieik,t1_fb38wjr,1576639396.0,":/ It shouldn't be this hard, bit for some reason it is. 

If you have trouble getting your job description you could try recruiting (if you have that department). 

I hope you are able to get everything done with your doctor and to formally have the process in motion. In this I think you need your own advocate, as shitty as that maybe."
cscareerquestions,fb37cqv,t1_fb2c93j,1576465964.0,This is why people don't trust or like HR. You shouldn't have had that experience. Under ADA they are required to give you a reasonable accommodation if one is warranted (i.e. your doctor says it is needed). Not doing so can open them up to a lot of legal ramifications. I am sorry you had such a horrible experience. I do recommend doing whatever to protect yourself and look into the next steps as necessary. During this you want to be heard and supported not laughed at. You might consider who higher up you can also talk to about your experience and needs. (Sorry if this is all over the place!)

BipolarReddit,fa02xvr,t1_f9zt54s,1575748267.0,"My psychiatrist said it could be a side effect of Lithium, but it's been happening longer than I've been on Lithium. You are on meds specifically for the memory issues? Do they help? And I haven't done any therapy for dissociation, all of it has been general talk therapy."
BipolarReddit,f9ynkm9,t1_f9wu93d,1575731150.0,"Can you tell when you dissociate? If so, how? Also, do you know of your memory issues are linked to anything (i.e. medication)? Thanks!"
BipolarReddit,f9ynbue,t1_f9wu579,1575731046.0,I have basically destroyed a notebook in a my first month at work trying to remember what it is I do.
BipolarReddit,f9ym33m,t1_f9wnxju,1575730534.0,"Yeah. I think so. I know for a fact it is happening outside of manic episodes. It can be like everyday things, like remembering what was said to me in a meeting or even remembering the contents of my day."
BipolarReddit,f9wkq2m,t1_f9wbv0a,1575694212.0,Thanks! I am working with my Dr. there too & we are looking at lowering my lithium dose.
BipolarReddit,f9wkl5n,t1_f9wape6,1575694148.0,"All times, but not all the time. If that makes sense. It's not specifically during any episode, but because I can't remember I couldn't tell you how many times it has."
BipolarReddit,f9lqz12,t3_e5fd93,1575429763.0,"A few years ago I was in a terrible place. Work made my chest cave in and working was physically painful. I started having panic attacks so bad in the morning I couldn't make it to work. I was calling out of work everyday and eventually my doctor put me in an outpatient program. Long story short, I used FMLA the whole time. That is 100% what it is there for. If you are eligible, use it and protect your job. It is easier to explain and for people to accept when it is something like a broken bone and you are right it is so much harder when your brain is sick. But, you have to take care of you. Part of that is taking care of your mental health and part is making sure you'll still have a job by using FMLA. Hope things start to look up."
cscareerquestions,f9exmi1,t1_f9e5hu4,1575254203.0,"I totally understand, on all fronts. I work in HR and it was really difficult to make sure only the need to know people knew. Depending on where you are the contact group might change. You can always try your benefits team too. Good luck friend!"
cscareerquestions,f95bt03,t1_f94irp4,1575124273.0,"If you have a specific HR Partner/Business Partner, start with them. If you don't, but have a Leave Administration Team, I would try them next."

Also, don't feel bad about asking your question! I am about 6 years in and don't know the answer, I've just always skated on the same wheels ðŸ¤¦ðŸ˜‚"
cscareerquestions,f9488bt,t3_e3kgm9,1575080288.0,"I would suggest talking to HR before things get bad. If you are worried about your review, it's better to get out ahead of it. As someone in HR, I can tell you my bosses always were sympathetic with those who didn't use their disorder as an excuse after something happened. I would also talk with your therapist/psychiatrist about it to see what changes might benefit you. I personally had an accommodation that allowed me to work from home more often so I could go to my doctor appointments. Good luck!"
BipolarReddit,f71tebc,t1_f71ekps,1573347760.0,"Working out helps me a lot too. Writing helps me to process my feelings, thoughts, what's going on, etc. I also like reading/listing a good book or listening to a good podcast to pull myself out of the moment. If I can and have the willpower to, I'll find away to be around someone or a select group of people.

Good luck, you've got this."
BipolarReddit,f6y3a58,t3_dtjzlj,1573266363.0,"I can relate to what you are saying, it hits home. My doctor diagnosed me as bipolar type 2. It took awhile to get to that diagnosis and even more trial and error to get to a mixture of meds that work. I still have my swings, but they are manageable now. Hope that things start to look up for you!"
BipolarReddit,f35e8yx,t3_dfr2fz,1570675291.0,"I've started probably 5 to 7 blog projects over the years and have either never got past the initial idea or just abruptly stopped working on them. I have one now where I write about my mental health and a ""anything goes"" one for all the other random things. I also drift in and out of love/obsession with roller derby. Overall, you aren't alone buddy :)"
