BipolarReddit,epujgbc,t1_epu6377,1559510648.0,"Edibles can easily take up to an hour to kick in, maybe longer for some people. (I’m no scientist tho so take this with a grain of salt lol) That said though they tend to be a longer lasting high depending on the dosage. I’ll still occasionally get paranoid when I’m stoned but the good usually outweighs the bad in my experience. I’ve never had a significantly negative impact from it and if anything it helped keep me calm during my first manic episode."
BipolarReddit,eptbj4p,t3_bvwix8,1559486625.0,I’m a frequent marijuana user and have positive effects from it but I know for other bipolar patients it can be a disaster. Just start slow and see how you react before you do higher doses.
