There will be two divisions, one for PC and one for console. I cannot ensure the integrity of the PC divisions at this time due to the pop reset option.

The contests motivate you to explore new areas and hunt hard for animals you haven‚Äôt before. You‚Äôre gonna see cool new stuff. Grab some screenshots, cool pics of the scenery, other harvests, or setups you‚Äôd like to share along the way to your monster trophy during each contest. The harvest and your leaderboard rank is secondary to the fun you have along the way. There are bronzes killed that are bigger than golds because of the experience.  So post those silvers, golds, bronzes, and **share your awesome hunting journey each contest!**

# Rules

1. Contest is for The Hunter: Call of the Wild (PC, PS4, XBox)
2. Only harvests taken between ***Friday, November 1, 2019*** and ***Sunday, November 3, 2019*** will be eligible.
3. Coyote and Jackrabbit Only.
4. Any weapon is eligible for use this hunt.
5. This is a dual-species Hunt. Your entry will be your highest-scoring Coyote and Jackrabbit.
6. The LAMP Color Bonus Rule will be in play this hunt.
7. Any ties will be broken by the higher Trophy Score between the two harvests. If still tied, it will be broken by the heaviest weight between the two harvests. To qualify for a tiebreaker, your ""Confirm Trophy"" screen must be submitted along with your entry.

# How to submit your entry

Use [Imgur](https://imgur.com) to upload your screenshots.

Please include the **ENTIRE** uncropped and unedited version of each screen. Once posted in a comment in the ""Official Thread"", test your link. If the harvest data isn‚Äôt clearly visible, try uploading again. Sometimes IMGUR degrades the quality during the upload.

[Here is an example of the ""Confirm Trophy"" screen](https://i.imgur.com/j0av7UW.jpg) which helps us break ties by trophy score or weight.

*Entries are submitted by posting an Imgur album link with screenshots of your ""Latest Harvests"" screen in the Codex menu to the ""Official Thread"" for this hunt that will be posted on the starting day of the Hunt. The ""Confirm Trophy"" screens must be added to the album as well, as we use this screen to determine trophy score and weight in the event of a tie.  Entries must be posted in the comments of the ""Official Thread"" to be eligible. The ""Official Thread"" will open early and stay open late to accommodate submissions from all time zones. The important part is that your ""Latest Harvests"" screen screenshot indicates the harvest was on the correct date.*

**Keep in mind that the latest harvest screen only logs your latest 20 harvests**, so multiple screenshots of this screen may be necessary. Especially in combination hunts or multi-day events where a hunter may harvest more than 20 animals in between submissions.

During weapon-specific hunts, you **MUST** submit a picture of the ‚ÄúConfirm Trophy‚Äù screen along with the ‚ÄúLatest Harvest‚Äù Screen. It‚Äôs the screen that pops up right when you hit ‚Äúconfirm trophy‚Äù and shows the animal‚Äôs score. Comparing this to your ‚ÄúLatest Harvests‚Äù screen is the only way the judges have to confirm the correct Weapon was used. It is recommended to always include this screen, as it also used in the event of a tie. If there is a tie and one hunter doesn‚Äôt have proof of trophy score or weight with this screen, the hunter with this screen in their entry wins by default. It disappears with the press of a button and there is no other way to confirm what weapon was used, please be mindful of this.

# The LAMP Color Bonus Rule

Any harvest of an eligible species that has a fur-type of Leucistic, Albino, Melanistic, or Piebald (LAMP) will receive +60 to its overall score. Any fur-types other than LAMP and common will receive +30.

|Fur Type|Bonus points|
|:-|:-|
|Leucistic|60|
|Albino|60|
|Melanistic|60|
|Piebald|60|
|Uncommon|30|
|Common|0|

I understand that cheating is possible, but in reality you would only be cheating yourself out of a good time. So be a good sport, you will be disqualified if you cheat.

Happy Hunting!"
