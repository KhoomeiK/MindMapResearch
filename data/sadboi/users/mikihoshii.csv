also... i can upload pictures, but basically the area i am working with, there is a bunch of dead plants, mostly because this area is neglected by my grandfather (his house/yard, i am just working in it). how do i turn the area into a good place for pretty flowers and plants?

edit: sorry not a lot of dead plants. i misremembered, just took a look. theres just a lot of what seems to be weeds in this area.

thanks!"

She is not shedding right now so I am unsure. Since I got her a few days ago she is rather stressed but is otherwise pretty chill from what I understand.

I have actually owned a leo before although it has been years, I took well care of her until I had to give her away because I couldn’t take care of her anymore due to my own personal illness. I am in a much better place now so I wanted to get a new leo because I do adore them, I did brush up on what I know but mistakes do happen... I feel guilty about this trust me. I am just glad she is otherwise okay and I am going to make sure something like this doesn’t happen again."

She is 4-5 months old. I do not keep crickets in the tank for longer than 15 minutes but she is good about eating all of them. Should I switch to roaches or mealworms for a time so the crickets don’t nibble on the wound? Do I keep the fallen tail in there? :( I just want her to be okay
