ptsd,fql92c3,t3_gjacfe,1589450558.0,"My sincere condolences dear OP....

Losing someone close to us is always painful and traumatic. I can only imagine how hard it is when you also have to perform CPR on that person and have them pass in your arms. 

Your loss was as you wrote a month ago so it's still very very fresh. To fully understand what just happened takes some time and it's normal to struggle like you do at the moment. And it's ok. 

Grieving is a process that takes time. And I want to encourage you to take your time to grieve and to grieve the way you want to grieve. Most importantly, as already mentioned by others, it's important to let it out. That can mean crying. It can mean screaming. Or just taking your Mother in your arms and cry together. All the emotions, even anger, that emerge are valid and by expressing them you will, step by step, feel a little lighter. A little closer to coming to terms and peace with this loss. When you're ready, you may want to check out Elisabeth KÃ¼bler-Ross whose works about grief are very valuable and comforting. 

I met some people who didn't express their feelings during the day for a variety of reasons and couldn't sleep at night because it was all in their system. If you have no issues with that, I could imagine writing down what goes on in your mind and your heart might help. You could also talk to your Dad, something I find very helpful if you're the type of person for that. It can also be of help to stay in a positive memory if it appears and manages to break through that blockage you described. Since it's such a fresh memory, it may take a while to get better because this is something you don't just wipe away. 

You're probably asking yourself if this is already a PTSD or if it can develop into PTSD. I'm from a medical background but I'm no psychiatrist or therapist. I suffer from Complex PTSD so I know a thing or two about it. To be diagnosed with PTSD, certain criteria have to be met and the symptoms have to persist for a certain amount of time. 

For now I would say that, while your experience was traumtic without a doubt, you are still in the middle of processing the loss, the circumstances of your loss and your grief. And it takes time and it is tough. I find it great that you look for a way to manage this by, for example, writing about it here. 

If you feel it's getting worse, be it the sleep, the nightmares etc., don't hesitate to look for help.  It can be a doctor and in addition maybe a self-help group for people who lost someone. I know that many people immediately reject the thought of visiting a doctor but when a situation worsens and someone becomes physically, emotionally and psychologically exhausted, it's important to get help and support. And it's ok to do so! That doesn't mean you will get knocked out with pills or be like me having to eat pills like candy to find sleep :) But they usually have some kind of network and info on where to start. And besides, there are great natural remedies like tea that can aid in calming they might know about. 

One thing that you may find some comfort in is that your Dad wasn't alone when he crossed over. He was with people he loved and who love Him. 

I'm wishing you and your Mother all the best and many many blessings. It WILL get better :)"

CPTSD,fpzrea4,t3_gg9jlj,1589022370.0,"It's a very understandable need to be seen, heard and ideally, to be understood.

For a lot of people, a mental health issue is something that can't be that bad or they think people like us are like the crazies in movies. A lot of them also aren't prepared for what's really going on, aren't prepared to hear the stories that led to the point we're at.

It might surprise you, but I met A LOT of people, and I'm among them, who said: I wish I had cancer or this and that because then you have something to point at, like an MRI or lab results etc. People usually don't question a diagnosis like that. That's how desperate we can become.

With a mental health disorder often comes a lot of shame. I remember sitting in a cab in summer, jacket on to cover the fresh scars on my arms and sweating like hell because I had a major panic attack. The driver noticed it and said it's hot right and I just answered yeah but it's because I'm ill. He asked if I had a cold and I answered no, I have cancer and it comes from the medication, absolute bullsh\*t but I was so ashamed of telling the real reason. For CPTSD it's normal to have days where you can validate your trauma and the suffering it causes and then there are days where you think that's it's not that bad and other's have it so much worse and then I feel some shame because I **think** I endured so little.

When people then finally see your pain, they are often overwhelmed. When I heavily selfharmed, in my case to get out of intense panic attacks and flashbacks, and showed the result because I couldn't answer the ""How are you"" with words anymore, people left. And yes, it was hard to see even for myself.

I'm 5 years into the journey towards healing and I can reassure you that, while still to this day I have days where I act like I'm ok, you will, step by step, find ways to allow yourself to not be ok and to communicate that. Not to everyone and not everytime, but in ways that you feel comfortable with. It was a massive relief to be able to say that it's a shitty day and that I'm in pain and people were wholeheartedly present and love me the same as they did before it all went over board. So I wish for you that you have people who can be like that for you, should you decide to open up someday in person.

With time, you will learn to validate yourself and your story and even when there is stagnation or a step back, you will be able to center again and find strength and selfcompassion in you.

But most importantly, you are not alone. It's a huge step to come forward and telling your story here. I can't stress enough that this is a huge accomplishment because it's tough. It will help you for sure to have a place where you can tell how it is.

Stay blessed, you got this!"
ptsd,fputl18,t1_fpt5rnd,1588923251.0,"Thank you for sharing this and WOW! It sadly doesn't surprise me. Simply because I know how difficult it is for us to face what has been done to us and the amount of work it takes. To have someone going with us to therapy because they genuinely want to help heal requires a lot of understanding and selfreflection on their part and I haven't met a single person where that was the case.

I hope, for everyone, that one day the mother's and father's and exes and what not just say: ""I know you're hurting, I messed up and I'm sorry. What can I do to help you heal?""

You're also the first person I ""met"" where a parent or anyone else being part of the trauma said: "" I want to go with you to one of your therapy  meetings."" And I met many during my hospital stays. 

Is that something you or anyone here, and I know that it depends on a LOT of factors, would consider? Coz I couldn't do it.

I'm wishing you the best :)"
CPTSD,fpt2s38,t1_fpsvljh,1588883864.0,Thank you so much! I'll check them all out especially because I found this approach to be something to dive deeper into during my clinical stays. :)
CPTSD,fpt1oxu,t3_gewjlo,1588883328.0,"Oh yes, that is exactly me just with my father and to a lesser degree my brother. Blocking my father 2 years ago was the best decision I made and like you, I wish him no harm. I can wholeheartedly say that I absolutely don't love him and that I don't care about his life at all, except for the fact that I neither wish him ill nor anything bad happening to him. That last part could be interpreted as let's say the more spiritual aspect of love but that's it. 

Do I sometimes feel a sense of guit or shame? Yes.

Do I sometimes feel like I should at least call and ask if everything's ok especially now? Yes. 

That inner voice probably all of us know can be really challenging because it echoes the words of the ones that didn't want to hear ours. 

I started communicating with my inner children and their opinion is pretty clear on that matter: NO THANK YOU!

Reflecting on the past, even the recent past, is something I found helpful when the self guilt tripping starts. Did he and his inner circle asked ME how I felt? Did he change attitude or showed empathy? Was he sitting next to my bed in ICU several times? Nope. He is the same as 40 years ago. Just because we share some DNA I'm not obliged to love him and participate in his delusional world. Just because I was a child doesn't mean I'm obliged to willingly accept being treated like a doormat. No one was born to be treated like a doormat. 

To finally stand up for ourselves, finding our voice and letting it be heard clearly, setting the boundaries that were overstepped so many times and having our own backs even if it's just a little is absolutely justified and our right. 

There will be bad days. And there will be good days. 

But I smile as my imaginary middle finger towards him becomes more and more stable :D

You did the right thing. Stay blessed :)"
CPTSD,fpsxplb,t1_fpqx28y,1588881385.0,"I have to chime in here to tell you that it's a huge step to come here and talk about how you feel and what you're struggling with. It's something you can wholeheartedly be proud of! To have a community where you can open up, that won't judge you and where people can relate is very valuable and helpful. I know how hard it can be to carry such a burden alone and I'm happy you found a way to get it off your chest and also to open up for new perspectives, experiences and so on. The act of writing can be very therapeutic as well. I wish for you that you will find a therapist soon that matches your needs in this tricky situation but until then remember you are NOT alone and that at least here you have a place where you're heard, where you can find validation and hopefully inspiration on your way to healing :)

I'd HIGHLY recommend Pete Walker's book ""Complex PTSD: From surviving to thriving"", this book is a treasure! I ordered it 2 years ago and I'm not done yet because I'm still working with the insight and validation the first few chapters gave me. 

Something I haven't tried yet is an in-app-purchase and ad free app for IOS and Android called SuperBetter, it's also free. I read about it in an AmA of the developer and it's maybe worth checking out for you:

CPTSD,fpsqmov,t1_fpqulnn,1588877953.0,I just found out about this book today iirc in [https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/). I gained a ot of insight and response during body oriented therapies like Feldenkrais for example. Haven't checked the content of the book yet but does it deal with how the body stores traumatic experiences and the reactions to it?
CPTSD,fpsq2wd,t3_gey90j,1588877689.0,"Yes, I can relate very much. 

When I have a lot of triggers for my anxiety during the day and especially in the last weeks, I physically shut off. Meaning I come home from getting groceries(that triggers me in a lot of ways), I can manage to put everything away, lie down and I'm knocked out, sometimes for hours. It takes maybe 5 minutes and I fall asleep. 

If it's something triggering my trauma or the trauma associated anxiety, I either dissociate fully, sometimes ""partially"".  

So you're not alone in this and ther IS hope :)

CPTSD,fov64hg,t1_fov48ih,1588095998.0,"It is immensely important. Thankfully, reading Pete Walker's book  **Complex** **PTSD : From Surviving To Thriving** validated me a lot before I met my current therapist. I never selfharmed, it all started with my panic attacks when I was 35. It was the only way to get me out of the panic attacks. I even documented it because I couldn't believe that I had to do that. It was good to hear that self harm isn't uncommon for people with CPTSD. It's less frequent in comparison to BPD, but it still exists.

I'm happy to hear that you found someone who validates you and who makes you feel heard :)"
NDE,fov4u1g,t1_fouwh92,1588095398.0,"Yeah it can be really confusing and the theories are manifold. I think that some people who were actually clinically dead don't remember anything because they didn't need that experience or the recollection of it if that makes sense. Than there is the theory that some people experience a world that resembles their current state of being so they can heal and grow. I really liked Eben Alexander's first book because he was a huge sceptic and on top of that a man of science. Or for example one woman who had an NDE, saw her aunt and was confused because this aunt wasn't dead. When she came back her family told her that she passed while she(the woman with the NDE) was having surgery so she couldn't possibly know her aunt died. 

With time, you will find your individual way of dealing with this subject. Just take care of you and that you don't become overwhelmed or sad too often. Besides death as the great unknown there is also life and I'm a friend of cultivating compassion, empathy and kindness, all things that our planet needs and while even those can make someone sad at times, there is also a lot of joy to be gained from it :)"
CPTSD,fov296q,t3_g9k2gr,1588094206.0,"I can relate partially to what you describe. It took me years to find a therapist who actually treats CPTSD. Sadly a lot of people with CPTSD get diagnosed with Bordeline Personality Disorder and treated for that. I stopped counting the times people diagnosed me having BPD simply because one of my symptoms was selfharm. The many times my medical history was incomplete or completely wrong. It still makes me somewhat angry because as a medical professional I really have zero tolerance for such grave errors.

Before I found my current therapist I felt invalidated during my last 9 week hospital stay. My therapist there, as nice and friendly she was, always made me feel like I'm exaggerating or not trying hard enough. I felt like she wasn't believing me. I told her so but it carried over. Invalidation is a huge part of my CPTSD and on top I often invalidate my suffering as well. It's bad when a therapist does this instead of acknowledging how you feel and felt. I'm happy my therapist is so different and I finally feel validated and heard. But when there I always justify or try to prove something. Sometimes I think I should hurry up to get well soon while knowing very well that it needs time to heal years of abuse. All thanks to therapists feeding invalidation.

Many blessings to you and that you will never experiences something like that again :)"
ptsd,fouynle,t3_g9fkfr,1588092538.0,"Oh dear, I'm really sorry and my heart goes out to all involved...

As a medical professional and suffering from CPTSD I hope I can somehow be of help to you. 

I worked 10 years in medicine and during that time I had 3 CPR'S, one happening when I was off duty. Having patients in such a critical condition is never easy, even for the people working as first responders or in an ER. 

Finding someone like that is something you can't be prepared for, nor can we predict how we will react. In hindsight we can find a hundred things we could've done or shouldn't have done, but in THAT moment, when confronted with something so difficult and unusual, things often aren't that easy or clear, taking also the emotional and psychological distress into account. Some people, like me, tend to freeze when feeling intense fear so I hope that your sister doesn't feel any guilt because she couldn't move. It happens quite frequently. 

For feeling guilty because you didn't do mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-nose, try to remember and repeat what the professionals said, that you couldn't have done anything different. Medics have equipment you simply don't, like an ambu bag for ventilation just to name one. Safety first is something no one can blame you for. See, even in that difficult situation you thought about your health and the ones it might affect IF this man had any kind of infectious disease. You tried everything you could in that moment. The best you could. And you held his hand which is such a wonderful act of kindness and compassion that probably comforted and helped him and his family more than you'll ever know. You didn't fail him at all. 

It's tough and painful but it will get better. You came here for comfort and support and that's awesome and important because you don't have to go through this all alone. And it's ok to cry and let it out. It's part of healing and making peace with a situation you encountered unprepared and you're probably unfamiliar with that you handled amazingly!

Many blessings to you and we're here for you :)"
NDE,fourh56,t3_g9o0l2,1588089181.0,"While I never had an NDE, I hope my comment can somehow comfort you because I know this too well.

When I was between 9 and ten/eleven, my very good friend was diagnosed with cancer. One day we went for a walk and I asked her, if she is scared of dying to which she replied with a huge smile: ""No. I will come back, maybe as a butterfly."" I was surprised because such a thought, like reincarnation, never crossed my mind. When my parents got divorced and we moved away, she passed shortly after. I was twelve and massively afraid of dying after she crossed over, so afraid that I started being depressed. It affected me tremendously.

One night, I woke up and someone was standing at my bed. A few years ago I would've said it was my guardian angel, today, I lean towards this being was her. I thought I'm dreaming but there it was, long blonde hair and radiating golden light. In her hand she held a book, pointed towards it and then holding her index finger up.

A few months after this, still fearful of death and with a thousand questions in my head, my stepfather's friend invited me home to stay a few weeks there because the situation at home wasn't good. In her living room she had lots of bookshelves with LOTS of books and I was in heaven :D

The first book I grabbed was a book about where we come from and where we go after death. I read it almost in one sitting and my fear was gone. I knew then, why this angel/my friend showed up and what book she meant. Today, I wouldn't agree to a lot of things from that book, my fear is still gone though. Probably because I continued researching NDE's and also because of many experiences teaching me that there is something beyond.

Some quick examples would be me experiencing very clear out of body experiences and those confused me a lot. It happened quite frequently till late teenage years. When I read about OBE's for the first time my experiences finally made sense and I had no clue about it before so I didn't imagine it. To this day, and especially in the last 2 years, my family and me had crazy occurances where 2 people who crossed over(one 14 years ago, the other one in 2017) reached out to us(me in particular) to comfort and prepare the people who needed it. Things we/I couldn't possibly know.

Now my experiences may not prove anything but for me they're pointing towards the survival of consciousness after our physical body stops functioning.

I still love this quote: ""  We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.""

A book I love to recommend is: [Science and the Near-Death Experience: How Consciousness Survives Death](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Chris-Carter/dp/1594773564/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=science+and+the+near+death+experience+chris+carter&qid=1588088394&sr=8-4)

There was an amazing experiment of remote viewers conducting a blind experiment with multiple remote viewers and the afterlife was the target.

If you browse a bit in this forum you will find some awesome NDE stories and I can only encourage you to read them and watch some one youtube. It'll help you find some peace of mind and hope. I remember that the thought of **Nothing** after we die was freaking me out. Today, while I still believe in something beautiful awaiting us, that thought has lost a lot of it's power. Simply because I understood that IF there is NOTHING, we won't notice. :)

Many blessings to you :)

emotionalabuse,fog1h6c,t1_fochsro,1587746486.0,"I'm happy to read that it made you feel validated and heard. From my own experience I know that it can make things a little easier. 

I met my fair share of people who held their abusers responsible. I was about to do this as well but I'm not currently capable of it and there is no danger for others. As you already wrote, the abuser being held responsible to help the victim is not a good idea. Being constantly or often exposed to the person who caused your pain is not beneficial at all, even if it would be contact that is limited to text or anything similar. Especially when someone is still in the process of recovering. There are moments where I would love to have some justice but when my father suddenly made contact again I just broke down. My justice, which is more selfcare than anything else, is keeping him away from me as far as possible and being very clear about it. I also give zero fucks about him having changed, because he hasn't. I offered many ways for him to acknowledge the suffering he caused by presenting facts in a respectful way, by crying and even begging for an ""I'm sorry"". It fell on deaf ears and a dead heart. An abuser usually unmasks very quickly when no profound change happened. And I smell fake change from the other side of the world. 

Most of us will have days where we come back to the unfairness we experienced. That's normal. Step by step we will reclaim and remember our inherent worth, broaden our shoulders with each piece of weight disappearing, head held high.

offmychest,fo8g4az,t3_g4rfwd,1587595898.0,"There have been so many beautiful answers here that I might not be able to add a lot to it.

As someone who was multiple times the person IN the bed, I can tell you that after the 4th time I was in the hospital for 3 months and it was a blessing because I got the right medication for the first time. I still remember calling my Mother after being 2 weeks there and telling her: ""Mum, I feal REALLY good!"" It hasn't been the case for years before that. So I think that while it's always hard for the parents as well as the person in the clinical setting as a patient, it can open new therapeutic ways that benefit all of you.

A few years later everything changed again but the strongest support, motivation, safe space was and is my Mother. Her face was always the first I saw when waking up again. She blames herself a lot of times, that she should've done differently in the past like leaving my abusive father. But there is no guilt to take and I let her know that so she can rest more easily. And you can't control such things bc life throws so many surprises at us we're not prepared for. From what I read, you seem to be an amazing Dad who loves his family. And not are you only showing it, you can also talk about it. I felt strongly how much love there is and this is something that can heal on so many levels. It's this love that makes it possible to embrace my Mother when no one else can. It's this love that sparks hope when we don't find it in ourselves. The road right now is surely bumpy, scary and painful. But I want you to know that the importance of love can't be stressed enough. And you have a lot of it. :)

It's awesome you have a strong support net irl and that you talked to us here. Sometimes, we just wanna get it off our chests and it helps.

In this difficult time please remember to take care of yourself as well but you already know this.

ptsd,fo8dows,t3_g4vaxj,1587594586.0,"For you and everyone reading this whose PTSD is childhood related I'd like to recommend the Complex PTSD subreddit:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/)

When I got diagnosed with anxiety disorder with agoraphobia, pretty soon they established CPTSD as a diagnosis and understanding this helped me a lot. It's a common theme to think that other's had it worse or people telling you exactly this. By doing this we invalidate ourselves and others do the same to us. On those rare occasions when someone else tells me this, interestingly usually the people responsible for my CPTSD, I like to remember Brene Browns quote: ""If you're not in the arena, I'm not interested in your feedback."" 

Remember: Your feelings and the way your PTSD affects you is valid. You don't have to prove anything to anyone. 

Have a look at Pete Walker's book: Complex PTSD: From surviving to thriving. It has so many validating sections that could benefit people with PTSD AND CPTSD.

Stay safe out there and you're not alone in this. Sending you many blessings :)"
emotionalabuse,fo8bidt,t3_g4p87u,1587593411.0,"I wanted to add that it's ok to feel what you call self pity. For me it's mourning the broken pieces, the countless moments feeling fear etc.. You get the idea. It's something to be sad about, something to be angry about. My abuse happened in childhood up to being a young adult and 99% of that time I had no choice but to silence and swallow the tears, the anger, the ""NO!""s. Letting those feelings out in a healthy manner can be very freeing and also healing.

As to the abusers carrying on like nothing happened... That was a recurrent subject in my therapy bc I wanted to understand it. As of now I know that they are damaged in their own way and I can let the search for answers go because that's not my problem anymore and it never was to begin with. It's essential to develop selfcompassion and kindness towards oneself. Learning to say no. Step by step incorporating that we are all equally worthy and deserve love, kindness, connection etc. just as we are. Building a relationship with ourselves can be tricky, but it's worth it.

I'm happy to hear you are in a happy and healthy relationship again and I can tell you that it's normal to still have panic attacks. Sadly, long term abuse/trauma can't be fixed with a bandaid-that would be awesome! :) It takes time as you surely know. I trust that you have people who support and understand you and where you're coming from. It helped me tremendously when I had a very close friend who embraced the moments when some trauma flashback happened and I could talk about it without being judged.

Usually it takes quite a while and a lot of proofreading before I post. Just last week I had a comment ready to post and pressed cancel after 1 hour because there were already great comments and I felt I wasn't adding anything to it.

Interestingly, I found that writing a comment, and not sending it, is selftherapeutic most of the time and I know I'm not the only one.

In terms of allowing: I know it's hard to make the voice saying ""My voice matters"" louder and the other saying ""My voice doesn't matter"" more quiet. It makes sense when we look back on our trauma/s and find that our voice didn't matter, count, wasn't heard or simply non-existing. The same goes for judgement: ""My trauma isn't that bad so I better be quiet"".

**EVERY VOICE MATTERS!**

Period. There's not much to add. Your story, your thoughts, feelings, voice, all that matters and you have every right in the world to be seen and heard.

So feel free and allow yourself to post here if you feel the need :) Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't and that's perfectly fine. My voice matters works like a mantra (without any religious context), just like I'm worthy, I'm enough, I'm loved and I deserve love, belonging and kindness/happiness.

Many blessings :)"
CPTSD,fbz8n4t,t3_ef114f,1577238531.0,"Hi u/katembers,

I read the whole thread so far and I wish I could give you some advice. It can be tricky to find techniques that work, therapists who ""fit"" and also a good medication if necessary. From the top of my head I would think of smelling salt to break dissociation. I tried it once and it's terrible but my therapist for example uses it if everything else fails. There might be other options in terms of smell, something not too overwhelming but pleasant to you. I met people who used a little ball with spikes (Igelball) and either squeeze it with their hands or rolling it with a foot.

When I dissociate, re-orienting techniques work for me. I usually can't be touched if it happens. So if I'm capable I gently tap my legs, arms etc. to slowly come back. When someone is around, asking me things like What is your name, where are you, what day is it etc. work very well. Maybe you could record those questions and listen to it when you're alone and it happens?

I was in a holistic clinic in 2016 and I benefitted a lot from Feldenkrais, Heileurythmie etc. in conjunction with classical psychotherapy there. The problem is that in the past patients could stay there for up to 3 or more months and health insurances didn't cause any problems. Sadly, it's cheaper to have a patient stay a few weeks and have working medication. It was in my 7th week I noticed changes with the ""alternative"" forms of therapy and a longer stay would've probably stabilized me a lot more.

Maybe you just browse the web a bit for a clinical setting that treats a patient as a whole if you ever consider going for a stay.

Finding a therapist who uses EMDR and with a proper degree can be difficult because there often aren't that many.

I wish for you to find the root of the ""problem"" and ways and people helping you heal. It's hard and I'm sure I'm not exclusively speaking for myself when I tell you how often we think about giving up. Just know that you aren't alone. We might all be strangers but we're all connected not only because of our suffering but also because of our journey called life with all it's ups and downs. So whenever you or anyone else reading this feels alone and overwhelmed or just to share something-you're always welcome here. :)

Be good to yourself. Reward yourself if you managed to do something difficult. Celebrate the little victories. If shit hits the fan, and usually for me this happens daily, I go and look for things I love, be it animals, watching the stars, friends etc. It may not solve anything but it's a bit of light when it's kinda dark.

Take care of yourself and many blessings. You got this :)"

ptsd,faw4anb,t3_eaphw3,1576365747.0,"Hi u/ProblematicFeet.

The first time I experienced dissociation as an adult was last year when I was 9 weeks in a hospital, initially for my anxiety-/panic disorder. 2 weeks in it was recommended to also do trauma therapy. Certain situations during that stay and also afterwards(last time 4 weeks ago for a couple of days) caused me to dissociate. Usually I become pretty catatonic and have a thousand-yard stare. Sometimes I can't feel my whole body, sometimes I can't feel the upper or lower part of my body. It feels for me like parts of my body are drained if that makes sense. For example my head gets lighter, empty, vision tunnelled and then blurred. I usually don't talk at all when it happens or I'm monosyllabic. I can hear but it takes some time to realize it. In therapy, my counsellor was asking what my name is, what date it is etc. for reorientation so I can refocus and break the dissociation. 

Although we know when we dissociate and the reason why our brains resort to that type of reaction, it's a scary thing when I think about it. I'm sorry that you and anyone else have to go through this. Especially your last paragraph... But I'm happy that you can talk about it and that you are working towards healing. I know it's tough. I struggle everyday. It's a blessing to have people who know what it is like.

Take good care of yourself and many blessings to you :)"

CPTSD,fapf59g,t3_ea7vb2,1576286998.0,"From late kindergarten, elementary school and beyond until I was 15 years old I had massive problems in school. I read that children suffering from CPTSD sometimes have learning issues of varying degrees; that wasn't the case with me. I was always a fast learner who could also apply and memorize the things I learned.

The problem with me was that I was very disruptive in class. In elementary school my Mother was invited to talks at least 1-2 times a month. I also had fights regularly during recess but not because I wanted to fight. The bullies wanted to fight. That our principal was using physical punishment didn't make things better. I was indeed tested for ADD because my teachers thought that besides getting bored easily all the other types of behaviour could be a sign of ADD. But it wasn't.

In junior high I had 2 school exclusions because the situation with my stepfather wasn't good at all and he was the more harmless version of my father.

I hope it's not too OP but I thought serious problems in school could also incorporate behavioral issues."

Anxietyhelp,f97nsxw,t3_e41cmu,1575168035.0,"Hello there! :)

I experience what you describe regularly. On the other hand there are deeply rooted causes for it and you describe that you can't think of a trigger besides being under a little stress with exams. 

I'm no psychologist but if you are certain that this all started when your exam preparation started, then I'm inclined to say that it's probably not anxiety in the sense of an disorder but more like being on edge if that makes sense? I remember when I was preparing for exams in the past, especially the big ones, I hated noise, crowds etc. and maybe that's the case with you as well.

It's difficult sometimes during periods of high workload to make room for stress relief. If you think it's purely to exam stress then allow yourself some fun and relaxation like going out with friends, sport, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation etc. Make sure to get **good** and **enough** sleep, that you stay hydrated and eat healthy (brain foods like nuts come to mind).

What I can't stress enough is the importance of being honest with yourself and listening to your body/soul/mind. If you feel it's getting worse, or that there is another cause: Don't hesitate to look for support. Be it friends, family or a therapist. Sometimes talking to someone you trust is all it needs. Sometimes a pro is needed and that's ok. Just take good care of yourself :)

Many blessings and good luck with the exams :)"
Anxiety,f97kp4c,t3_e41jw9,1575166898.0,"Absolutely!

A lot of people think that anxiety is simple worrying which it isn't. And surely everyone has something they are afraid of. But before being diagnosed with a certain disorder a good amount of evaluation was done and certain criteria met (e.g. persisting for x amount of time). 

As u/ChocolateBear99 quoted:  âa physical, mental, cognitive, or developmental condition that impairs,  interferes with, or limits a person's ability to engage in certain  tasks or actions or participate in typical daily activities and  interactionsâ 

I met a LOT of people whose lives are affected to a huge and crippling extent, myself included. As a consequence I'm also classified as severly disabled because of the anxiety-/panic disorder with agoraphobia and CPTSD and am currently retired. That fact added another open can of worms but it is what it is.

I hope that you feel better soon and receive every support you need. Never forget we are here if you need someone to talk to. :)

CPTSD,f95gp69,t3_e3puhw,1575127362.0,"This is a very profound and true statement and also something that took me almost 12 years to realize and accept. 

When I finally made that step, I had and still have moments where I feel like I'm punishing my father for something he obviously doesn't (want to) understand. But then I remember the many opportunities I gave him to start a change. It never happened, not even that one time where I cried on the phone begging him to say at least ""I'm sorry"". Or the zero fucks he gave about me struggling day after day and continuing his abusive, non caring and manipulative behaviour. 

I made that step last year and he came back at me a few days ago so bad that I lost a few pounds since then because I can't eat and I'm more hypervigilant than usual. 

A few weeks ago in therapy I told my doctor that I know it was and is important for me to stay away from my father but that at the same time, if I REALLY think about it, he is damaged as well and therefor not capable/willing of change/healing. And because of this possibility I'm sometimes torn. Torn because I wish that people acknowledge my troubles and at the same time shunning my father because of how he is who he is. 

Then again, at some point I had to let that thought go. Me acknowledging any troubles or bruises he may have and wishing him no ill is the most I can do. 

No amount of compassion and empathy justifies me withering in a toxic environment. Now it's time for self-compassion and empathy.

THANK YOU for sharing this! I started a post about this some days ago and never sent it because I thought it sounds too crazy.

When I was a child, everytime we would go swimming or somewhere cool, I had this ritual where I told the rooms in our house, the furniture, stuffed animals etc. that I take them with me mentally so they don't feel alone, left behind etc. It was very real for me and I believed that they would be able to participate in my activities. I couldn't bear the thought of them feeling sad, abandoned, alone, scared... At one point, because I'm smart, I just said: ""I'm taking the whole house with me!"". XD

In addition to that I also grouped things. For example when we had eggs in the fridge in the egg tray and my Mum took one or two out, as soon as one egg was alone I rearranged them so that they had at least one ""partner"". It still feels super crazy writing about it. 

More importantly, I'm glad to read that you are on your way of healing and yes, it's tough. But I wish you all the best and everything you need on this journey!

Anxietyhelp,f8e2kf6,t3_e0gobj,1574516964.0,"Hello  [u/daintylostsoul](https://www.reddit.com/user/daintylostsoul/) ,

good to see you here because it can help a lot to talk about what's bothering you. :)

I experience a good portion of what you experience as well but I'm no expert on psychology so I can't tell you: ""Yes, that's anxiety!"" or ""XYZ"".

What I would suggest is that you start a journal at least for a few days, where you note your symptoms along with when they happen and (possibly) why. This is helpful because you can ""let it out"" when no one is readily available for talking and it might show a pattern/causes that are valuable for a therapist and yourself.

After reading your post I wondered why you have certain symptoms and struggles. I know that introverts usually don't like to be the center of attention most of the times but reading your post and the info you've given, it's probably something different. Was there something that happened in your life(past and recently) that set all this in motion? Are there unresolved conflicts with people, work etc.? Those are questions that you don't have to answer here but for yourself as good as you can.

When it comes to anger, there are many ways to deal with it like sport, music, writing an angry letter (that you don't send). I'm no stranger to selfhurt during extreme panic attacks or trauma flashbacks(and not being borderline). Whenever your feeling of scratching or punching a wall and the like becomes overwhelming, try to focus on your breath. Slow breaths:

1. Take a long, slow breath in through your nose, first filling your lower lungs, then your upper lungs.
2. Hold your breath to the count of ""three.""
3. Exhale slowly through pursed lips, while you relax the muscles in your face, jaw, shoulders, and stomach.

You can use this during an acute panic attack as well when being angry, it also helps with hyperventilating.

Something I always recommend is this video:

[Marconi Union - Weightless (Official Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfcAVejslrU)

You can listen to it, breathe slowly and allow yourself to relax. ! Don't listen to it while driving etc. because it is DEEPLY relaxing !

Something you can start with as well is a technique called ""Safe Space"":

[https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/docs/SafePlace.pdf](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/docs/SafePlace.pdf)

Instead of giving this place a name you can also assign a gesture to it if that feels better for you (like tapping your shoulder for example).  You might check out Tapping/EFT as well. Those techniques should be practiced daily for some weeks to build up the effectiveness.

Something that's also working for a lot of people is bilateral stimulation. For example: Cross your arms in front of your chest. Tap your left shoulder with your right hand and your right shoulder with your left hand. This can also be done with crossed feet on the floor. Another trick is to apply pressure to your palate with your tongue or to exhale through your mouth with lips closed (you know, the way horses do it sometimes).

Besides all that, please take good care of yourself and don't feel ashamed as a lot of us do now and then for a variety of reasons. It's ok to say No. It doesn't help anybody when you constantly go over your limit. I told my friends very early what I suffer from and that went really well as it took a lot of pressure from me and also gave my friends a clear picture to work with. If you have such friends and you feel ready, try to tell someone.

And always remember that you can come to this sub or r/Anxiety when you need someone to listen.

I also know it might suck reading this now but: If you feel stuck, your symptoms persist or worsen, don't hesitate to consult a therapist. There's nothing wrong with that. Going to a therapist doesn't mean you need to run screaming through a mall with a banner that says: ""I'M CRAAAAAZYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!"" :D Because you're not crazy. You're looking for help and that's awesome. The same is true for the hotlines when it gets really bad.

ptsd,f8010yr,t3_dy3w0c,1574119216.0,"PTSD was always something I thought of being exclusively affecting people who suffered combat related trauma. When it was suspected I might suffer from PTSD, having no combat related trauma, I did some digging probably like you and got an idea of the disorder and what can cause it.

It was during my 9 week hospital stay where, in addition to my already diagnosed anxiety disorder and agoraphobia, I was diagnosed with CPTSD(complex PTSD). In my case it stems from childhood and young adult abuse. And even in the hospital setting, in my trauma therapy group, I felt ashamed listening to the disturbing stories of my fellow patients(which is actually a possible symptom of CPTSD-""others have it worse"").

As I understand it, the effects of adverse childhood experiences(ACE) and the resulting increase in risk of developing other health conditions, as well as the influence of ACEs on child brain development are not exactly new but a bit younger in comparison to other forms of PTSD.

But, no matter **where** your trauma comes from, **it is valid**! There is no invisible competiton whose trauma is worse; when someone suffers from trauma, no matter how insignificant others think it is, this person suffers. **Period!**

It sometimes also takes effort to remind oneself that this is one's trauma, one's unique story and the effects it has on oneself. I still struggle with this now and then.

\- Chop 4 fresh tomatoes, 25g fresh ginger and 2 cloves of garlic.

\- Chop 6 spring onions into fine rings(cut off the green part but keep a little green on the onions you're chopping), chop the green you chopped off into fine rings as well and put aside.

\- Stir fry the tofu cubes until they're golden with a light crisp, take them out and put aside

\- Put the ginger, spring onions and the garlic into the pan until they are sauteed nicely, you know, not burned to charcoal like I sometimes do :)

\-  Add the chopped tomatoes

\- Add 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, I use the light one and not the thicker one, and 2 teaspoons of curry powder. Adjust to your liking, I usually use a bit more. I don't use additional salt but the recipe says to add some.

\- Let that simmer for a bit, I like it when it's a bit thicker, then add the fried tofu cubes.

\- Serve it with some of the onion greens you put aside on top, unlike me who always forgets that. Also the recipe states to put some thai basil on top and everytime I cooked this, there was no thai basil to be found. It tastes awesome without and also with regular basil.

EDIT: Found the recipe so now there are the correct amounts mentioned as well."
ptsd,f7j1rwf,t3_dwfoqm,1573769175.0,"I lost my last job because the prognosis and severity of my CPTSD and anxiety-/panic disorder with agoraphobia was bad and lead to a termination of employment per contract. I'm sick for 5 years now, contract ended 2,5 years ago. I had 2 long clinical stays that didn't help a lot. Not because the clinics were bad but because of the complexity of the symptoms and causes. I ended up being on waiting lists for therapy for years without a single response, therapists who deal with trauma are rare as it is. I got an appointment at a psychiatrist after my 5th or so suicide attempt through Vitamin B who told my her about my situation. I got the right meds finally, which helped to a degree. It took another year to find a therapist who does behavioral and trauma therapy, the real sessions will start next week. I'm retired temporarily and fall under the category of being severly disabled. I'm not able to work, as much as I would love to and am currently scouting for something I can do from home to help me get out of the financial pressure which takes a huge toll on my health.

The good thing is that I was able to shut my father out of my life and that I slowly see what has been done to me. It's a first step towards healing when you know where it's coming from."
AskReddit,f7iv929,t3_dw84zi,1573766118.0,"When I was 7 or 8 years old, I was hiding under our dining room table with my pyjamas on and my favorite pillow. I was hiding because it has been made clear that my father was mad at me. I'm not 100% sure why he was mad but probably because I had trouble in school again.

He stormed into the dining room and I was about to wet myself out of fear and dragged me out of my hiding place. I was crying, confused and scared to death.

I asked him, what he's going to do and he said that he is going to abandon me. He proceeded to drag me into his car, me still in pyjamas and with my pillow and absolutely terrified.

He drove for a while until we arrived on a busy highway bridge and stopped the car. He told me to get out, which I didn't. He got out and approached my door, I at least tried to lock it but he was faster and determined to get me out.

No amount of screaming, crying and begging changed his mind as he dragged me out of the car and put me on the shoulder of the street. He got back into his car and drove away.

I stood there, frozen in terror, with my pillow and in my pyjamas, 100% certain I will die there.

He stopped the car after what felt like an eternity, reversed, put me back in the car and asked if I learned my lesson.

&#x200B;

That's one of the moments when I felt 100% fear."

Anxiety,f7fcast,t3_dvqybs,1573676432.0,Oh my God yes! It is especially bad when there is a long line at the cash register. I usually run around the store like I'm lost until the line is short enough for me to make it bearable. It's very exhausting and when it all started it was not uncommon for me to hide somewhere and cry. It sucks because I never had a problem around people neither at work nor in my private life.
NDE,f739h99,t1_f5s9bqv,1573389449.0,"When I attended trauma therapy during my last clinic stay, I was reminded that I shouldn't compare my suffering to those of others in the sense of ""they have it worse"". I could write a wall of text about this. 

That others are better off without me is a recurring thought I have more often lately and I know that it's not true. It's a projection of my despair and exhaustion. i try not to entertain that thought and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. 

It's good to hear that you found a lot of satisfaction in your current work. Coming from a job requiring empathy and compassion myself, I feel that despite all the struggles and scars I'm still able to connect and create a compassionate space to work in and it sounds like you are too. In a sense, you share a piece of ""heaven"" with others.

Brene Brown made this awesome statement in one of her talks: ""Choose discomfort over resentment."" I know that a lot of times it's easier said than done, but it's something to think about. I hope that you and your wife can work out something that's good for both of you. I totally understand your wish to move, if I had the money I would go somewhere else asap. There is just one thing that shouldn't be overlooked and that's the question if moving will really alleviate what's going on inside. It's a difficult subject. While most people would understand the desire to move somewhere with a different climate because of physical health problems, a lot don't when it is because of the soul longing for that change. It's not a rare phenomenon that you take the baggage with you. 

I hope you're out of hospital and doing well. Sorry for the late response.

Many blessings :)"

CPTSD,f5n5llv,t1_f5iolf6,1572296838.0,"I'm happy to hear you could take something positive from this video.

The implications are huge and I personally think that we as a society have to fundamentally change to make CPTSD and the like a thing of the past. It affects the way of parenting, education, healthcare etc. Before I even touched the CPTSD subject, I said that a child from a difficult upbringing doesn't always stay a child. One day they will become parents, spouses, partners, friends, teachers, CEOs.... and chances are high that whatever unresolved and unhealed parts they carry as well as behaviours and selflimiting coping mechanisms(sometimes destructive) are handed down to their kids, partners, students. Like a hereditary condition. And if you take into account(I do) war, poverty, starvation, the list is endless, we have a long way to go.

The first step to break free from history repeating itself is making the connection, spreading awareness and moving step by step towards healing. This also includes forgiving ourselves for mistakes we made that were a result of our own hurt and not a flawed character. 

Many blessings :)"
NDE,f5kfdbx,t1_f5jlb3h,1572262048.0,"With popular experiences I meant the experiences that gained worldwide attention like Anita Moorjani or Eben Alexander for example.

Your first part is familiar to me with the exception that it's the hurting(also the joyful!) parts of the **world** and it's inhabitants that play my empathy/compassion strings and that I usually don't want to die when this happens. That's a result of my ongoing spiritual journey. While this can be quite hard I appreciate it a lot and I can access a place of compassion and unconditional love(as unconditional as I can) inside of me to act upon. Be it my interaction with others, myself, the environment or using prayer/ meditation etc. I can't draw from the peace of an NDE and maybe because I never felt THIS kind of peace and love I don't think of going back there via pulling the plug. However, when seeing some of the unneccessary suffering in the world, or struggling with things in or around myself, I sometimes joke with my friend that I can't wait to excarnate and that I never want to come back here. Not because I'm enlightened or someone special but because a lot of what's going on doesn't resonate with that inner core of peace, love and compassion which i truly believe is not only a window to the ""other"" side but also made of the same ""fabric"" if that makes sense. So for you it may be an idea to explore ways of how to utilize what you experienced(the feelings during the NDE) in a way that benefits you and maybe others so that you can come to this place in this life in times of hardship and recharge/rest.

Now the second part of your reply is everyday business for me. I'm not going to lie, there is not one day I don't think about wanting to check out. Suicidal ideation is a symptom of CPTSD and it sucks big time because I don't fancy dying yet because I found the above mentioned place in me and in others. The only good thing is that even in my deepest despair I still have love and compassion inside of me. Even enough for myself. I manage to tackle some of the ""I wanna die"" moments via kind interaction with others or accessing love and compassion via different means. Most of the times though, and exacerbated by my anxiety-/panic disorder, the first thought is wanting to leave earth because everything is too much. It's also a different hurt than what I mentioned above. I keep fighting and time will tell who will win."

Instead of giving the place a name to bring the safe place back when  needed, you can also use a gesture, in my case I tap my heart centre a few times. You can get really creative with this technique."
CPTSD,f57kxkf,t3_dmsb12,1572038219.0,"I wish I could give you some awesome advice but me being super hypersensitive most of the time(like hearing a moth fart type of sensitive), I sadly can't. 

Now, instead of an awesome advice, I can tell you a few of my remedies. 

When it's sounds sending me off the edge I put my headphones on and listen to one of my many songs calming me down, centering me. For example:

[Marconi Union - Weightless (Official Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfcAVejslrU)

Note that this shouldn't be listened to while driving and the like because it's deeply relaxing.

If I need something that's reaffirming I listen to

[Hezekiah Walker: I need you to Survive \*Lyrics\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMcJL_UDAvw)

This is a gospel song but except God it doesn't mention any other religious themes. I do believe in a higher power that is the embodiment of unconditional love so I don't have a problem listening to this despite not being an active Christian but more of a spiritual person.

So I would like to encourage you to explore what types of songs, meditations etc. help you in coming down and giving you a sense of comfort. The same is also true for music that is upbeat when feeling low energetically. I have multiple lists, almost like a first aid kit with music. :)

As crazy as it may sound to others, I have this teddybear, the only stuffed pet I have left from my childhood and thankfully it's my favorite one. If it's a really difficult day, and I lie down to rest, I grab it and watch TV, usually falling asleep. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't but I'm happy it's there.

When it get's really bad I have my emergency medication but I usually drink a special tea with herbs that help relaxing before popping the pill.

If I need to bawl, I bawl till it's over. I met people who are ashamed of crying but I think it's important to release whatever is inside. 

Watching some funny videos, cute videos, inspiring videos, that's something that helps me a lot of times. 

Those are a few things that I do.

Many blessings :)"

The people I met who had an NDE or the more popular experiences of people always talked about incorporating this sense of peace and love into their everyday life, resulting in having another outlook on life and also consequently not fearing death anymore.

CPTSD,f573y0v,t3_dmt6l4,1572031143.0,"I worked many years as a physician assistant and later for an airline with a part time job in anesthesiology.

It was pretty clear for me from the start that I wanted to work in medicine because I find it incredibly fascinating. The caring part played a role as well, to make people feel comfortable and create a trusting, empathic environment. 

Interestingly, what paved the way to medicine was the fact that I was a severe hypochondriac. My Mum worked in medicine as a secretary during that time and when I visited her after school, I always read in this big clinical dictionary. It helped me a lot and when I started my training there was no trace of hypochondria left.

Looking back, the people I met during hospital stays mostly worked in some type of caring job, be it nurse, social worker, yoga teacher etc. or working with animals(also being vegetarian and vegan)."
