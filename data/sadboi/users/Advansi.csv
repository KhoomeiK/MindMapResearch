**Many New Yorkers and Americans are using laundromats and shared laundry facilities. What precautions should we be taking in these spaces?**

We have to look at two things: One, does the Covid-19 virus live on soft surfaces \[like clothing\] as long as it does on hard surfaces? It's not very clear right now. But in general, viruses last a couple of hours or maybe a day on soft surfaces, and then should be gone.  


The other thing to consider is that we're practicing social distancing right now, so is the laundromat a safe place to go? It probably is if you take careful measures, meaning take your disinfectant wipes and wipe down all hard surfaces, and wear gloves when you're handling your laundry and touching any surfaces. Do your laundry on the warmest water you can and then let it dry in the dryer for at least 45 minutes to kill any kind of bacteria or viruses that might be there.  


And if you're going to the laundromat or to the basement of your building \[to wash clothes\], go when there aren't a lot of people."

*Speaking to* [*South China Morning Post*](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3075567/people-blood-type-may-be-more-vulnerable-coronavirus-china-study)*, Gao Yingdai, a researcher with the State Key Laboratory of Experimental Haematology in Tianjin, said while the research may be helpful to medical professionals, the public should not worry too much about the findings.*

*She added: “If you are type A, there is no need to panic. It does not mean you will be infected 100 per cent.*

*“If you are type O, it does not mean you are absolutely safe, either. You still need to wash your hands and follow the guidelines issued by authorities.”*

*""First thing's first: the information does come from a study, but one that has not yet been peer-reviewed, and is currently available on the pre-print server* [*medRxiv*](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20031096v1)*. In fast-evolving situations such as this pandemic, accessing research ahead of peer-review is not necessarily a bad thing, but we do need to keep this in mind""*

*So, these relatively small differences, if replicated in studies with larger data pools, could lead to slight changes in the way we manage the spread of the disease; but even so, it probably won't change anything about the way we individually should be trying to* [*limit the spread of the virus*](https://www.sciencealert.com/practical-tips-for-coronavirus-prevention-and-how-not-to-panic)*.*"

Anxiety,fa7983f,t3_e7wwjf,1575832638.0,"Hey OP. I sympathize with you. I too am close with my mother and this year my mother went through a lot healthwise. She already had an unruptured aneurysm we've known about for years and she started having severe enough headaches to rush her to the ER multiple times. The next couple of months, I was a wreck. Constantly tracking my mother's health, freaking out about every little symptom. I almost changed her AppleWatch behind her back to call 911 if she ever collapsed!

After going to my therapist, I feel like there were two things that she told me, that made my worry subside, a lot

1. My mother knows her body better than I do. If something were truly truly wrong, she would let me know. 
2. Even if my mother suffered from any symptoms, there are a million ways it could be treated or diagnosed that are not fatal!

Case in point: I was convinced these severe headaches were a part of her aneurysm. It turns out, they were just hormonal due to her hysterectomy. And today, she hasn't suffered a headache since. 

I know its hard, and its so easy for me to sit here and tell you what to think. But trust in your mother. If something were truly wrong, she would let you or someone else in the family know. And even if it were worthy of her going to the hospital, there's so many treatments in modern medicine that do not end up in fatality. There's millions of conditions that are benign and let patients live fully functioning lives!  It might help to write out what you're thinking. Like ""mom is feeling hot and unwell"" and then list all the ways it isn't a death sentence. That way, you have a lot of other facts to add to your imagination about these scenarios.

I wish you luck OP."
Anxiety,fa70lq3,t3_e7xcaq,1575830268.0,"Oh I got a story for you OP. 

My entire life, I've been taught to suppress my bad feelings. I wasn't allowed to show that I was angry, sad, anxious and got in trouble for it by my parents when I did. You'd be surprised to know that that that did me damage in my adult life and those around me. At one point, my mood would shift so suddenly, I felt like I was possessed...

Anywho, after going to a therapist, the therapist shockingly recommended that I get my anger out, *safely.* If I do feel angry at someone or an event, no matter how irrational, I find a way to get it out. I scream in my car on an empty road. I punch pillows. I write scathing letters to those that I hate in the moment and burn them. 

I can't say that I'll never be angry again. I think there will always be things that will make me angry or annoyed. But in releasing my anger in those ways, it's helped me better control my emotions. So I don't have an outburst against someone that I love."

Anxiety,f9dzi6g,t3_e4ojgi,1575238249.0,"in all honesty, I would totally tell your therapist flat out that you want to talk about something that is bothering you. Or if she minds if you talk about whatever topic is troubling you. I've been with my therapist for about 3 years now and there's definitely been times where I've had to tell her directly that I want to speak about 'this issue' today because it's really bothering me. And my therapist always obliges.

I think if your therapist is a good therapist, she'll completely understand your request!"
Anxiety,f9dxwr4,t3_e4o54a,1575237829.0,"Dude, you have encapsulated my struggle for the last couple of days. If  I talk, I can't think about it too much or else I chicken myself out. But if I just talk freely, I'm good. I feel like the conversation flows. The problem is, like you, I fuck up and blurt out something that shouldn't be said. In my case, it's not racist things, but insensitive sarcastic things. 

Like 5 days ago, I was joking with a friend (we're both women) and I sarcastically remarked how I couldn't handle her morning sickness at work. Then later in the conversation, I made a joke about how I hated being nice because I did so many things for other people. 

It literally did not hit me that what I said was insensitive until an hour after the conversation. And although I'm sure my friend didn't think much of it or has probably forgotten about it by now, I have never felt so guilty in my life! It's like eating away at my heart that I could be so cruel without realizing it. 

I think there's a fine line between not thinking before you speak, and thinking while you speak. But to be honest, I haven't found that mythical sweet spot yet."
Anxiety,f9dlkul,t3_e4mujl,1575234655.0,"Your point about compulsive habits really resonates with me! I'm actually trying my hardest to not check my personal social media (Facebook and Snapchat).  Not because I was comparing my life to others but, because I waiting anxiously for certain people to post and I kept checking the same apps over and over and over, making my anxiety worse."
Anxiety,f9dl2sq,t3_e4n92y,1575234489.0,"I would say about a week, maybe a little bit more *without* bad anxiety. There's still a layer of anxiety there regardless but it doesn't make me feel like drowning like bad anxiety does."
