We headed out to a rural little town to look at a really lovely Victorian house. It looked nice, but I instantly felt creeped out when I walked into it. We were looking around the attic room and I decided to go off on my own and explore. 

I headed down the rather steep stairs and as I get to the landing I vividly remember feeling a sharp pressure on my back, like a shove, and I started falling down the stairs. Luckily I grabbed the hand railing before I fell too far, but it still freaked me out enough for me to just wait downstairs.

What makes it even weirder is that my mom later told me (Before I told her about my experience) that while my dad was looking out one of the large windows upstairs, she kept getting this uncomfortable feeling that he was going to get pushed out of it. Like, she was almost certain, and actually asked him to back up from the window.

deadbydaylight,fpga7co,t1_fpg74zn,1588598312.0,">If you're not already in position, there's a real good chance you just lose the game if any of your solo teammates play incorrectly.

I'm really confused by this, do you just drop whatever you're doing the second one of your teammates goes down so you can sit next to the hook and immediately grab them as soon as the killer turns around? Because from both a survivor and killer perspective that sounds really inefficient. Also like farming if you aren't running BT.

>It's one thing if you're just waiting for a survivor to show to chase (which is fine), but if you're just guarding the hook, switching targets to whoever is going for the unhook? Absolutely camping.

Handy, but I didn't say that's what I was doing. If I can tell that most of the team is hovering nearby for the unhook, I'll go hit someone I can see, wait for someone else to get the unhook, and hit the rescuer after they unhook (unless they literally rush the hook immediately after I hook someone, in which case, I hit them first for being god awful farmers). Three teammates injured, and I only had to move 20ft in any direction. If I can't see anyone, but no one lit up on my BBQ I'm going to do a quick look around the area, as most likely they're lurking somewhere nearby/will have left some scratch marks for me to follow. I'm not going to stop literally everyone from going for the unhook. Because yeah, that's camping. But patrolling the hooked survivor for a few seconds after hooking them =/= camping. Especially if you have good reason to believe the other teammates are in the area.

> The survivors know exactly what you're doing, and they're well aware that you will most likely continue to hook camp until second stage/death

Again. Not what I'm doing. If I can see people across the map on gens with my BBQ/other info perk, I happily leave the hooked area and go apply some of that good ol' pressure. Honestly, if I think the team is nearby, but I don't find anyone after 10-15 seconds of searching the area I'll head off towards a gen, but I'll definitely be keeping my eye on the hook and be ready to head back if someone unhooks while I'm still close enough to warrant going back. But if I'm pretty sure that the whole team is there waiting for the save and double heals, then I don't have any gens to pressure and I'm going to wait for someone to show up to chase, which you apparently have no problem with.

>They're not being overly altruistic, they just fully expect someone who is playing scummy to continue to do so, and they don't want to have a boring game.

Ah yes, I love when I actively don't tunnel, leave the hooked person after a maximum of 15 seconds, and am still playing ""scummy"". 
Also, yes, survivors are often painfully altruistic. And I say that as someone who plays both sides. I watched my entire team die because they saw me get downed near basement with Bubba and decided to get half of them trapped down there with me, while the other person danced up and down the stairs. Sure one of them unhooked me, but he chainsawed us all down and he got a 4k instead of the maybe 1k he possibly would have gotten if they hadn't swarmed the killer as soon as I was downed. I wasn't even surprised honestly, it happens so much. I've also been the killer in that situation, and it's just as painful.

polyamory,fleqk29,t1_fleno3s,1585089518.0,"I honestly try not to drag anyone into issues, the first person WAS poly, but didn't communicate well with their partner who wasn't, or with us, and it was just not good. The second person I didn't even let know anything was wrong, since I hadn't started anything so I feel they weren't dragged in. 

And I was honestly just hoping that I'd misread the signals from my fiance, since I dont want to believe that he'd lie about being ok with it when he isn't. And I dont really have anywhere else to go if it doesn't work out with him. 

But if he isn't then we need to sit down and have a long talk with each other about the future I guess."

ADHD,fl7g53j,t3_fmxcj1,1584901034.0,"I can relate and I cant. 

Theres definitely parts of me that feel like they're years behind other people, which is frustrating as heck. Like basic social skills are scary and give me a lot of anxiety. Networking? Not a thing I can do. Adulting things like taxes? Nope, need help. (And I'm 23, been paying them for 7 years now lol). Mostly the things where my ADD can act up and mess me up, are definitely things I've struggled figuring out. 

But I also had a really narcissistic parent growing up and the other enabled, so I got told to grow up and was kind of forced to more emotionally mature than a regular kid should have to be. So while I feel like I can interact with myself on a more mature level, interacting with the rest of the world is exhausting and a little scary at the best of times lol. 

Definitely not just you."

Hellenism,fkobm2z,t3_fjpkyl,1584383957.0,"You definitely shouldn't be ashamed to be in love with your patron. However, you should try and find a balance, because your last sentence does stand out a bit. Loving your god is perfectly fine, but it shouldn't affect your romantic/sexual relationships. I wish I had more advice for you there, but just maybe be careful with potential partners and their feelings, no one wants to feel like they're a filler for someone their partner can never have, especially a god."

All of this with mods because some of those NPCs are boring/needy af."
MaliciousCompliance,fko7tpo,t1_fkna7ck,1584381799.0,I'm so jealous of your union. When I worked a union job in a grocery store my union dues were so high that after I paid them my pay checked averaged out to less than minimum wage. No one could ever find our union rep and it felt like the union only cared about the much higher ups rather than the people actually working in the stores. Its left a bitter taste in my mouth and honestly made me hesitant to work for a unionized company again. Good to know that there are good unions out there though!

Firecracker when I got picked up. It worked... but blinded me permanently. The killer was so amused that I was walking into walls and obviously couldn't see that he just left me alone for the rest of the game lol. I think in the end he hooked me because he was going for adept, but still pretty funny."

I'm not sure what your comment is implying but I hope that it's that you've never been in a place like that mentally and I'm happy for you."
deadbydaylight,fkly4f9,t3_fj2pad,1584317121.0,"I got the daily for nurse to blink and hit people 4 times.... for me that's like trying out for the Olympics. I really didn't think it was going to happen. I loaded into a game and started out trying but it was kind of a bad day and I was getting really frustrated with myself after almost 3 gens and not one single hit, even while not blinking. 

The survivors could tell something was up I think and after a few gens they started standing still and waving for me to hit them. Then they helped me practice by moving in a straight line and then slowly swerving a bit. I hooked everyone twice and made sure they all got their pallet stuns and chases maxed and escaped and everyone was super sweet and kind post chat. 

I was actually crying, ngl. Thank you kind survivors. You really turned my day around."
