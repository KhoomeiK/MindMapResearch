IFchildfree,fr4skio,t3_gmawlm,1589896029.0,"I have started to look up books that have won awards. I can't really recommend much as far as childfree books. I have had a great time reading through the Hugo Award winners.

I go through many books, so these are the most memorable for me in the last year.

The Broken Earth Series by NK Jemison was incredible. I literally was finding any excuse to listen (I'm huge into audiobooks now and pretty much listen while I do chores).    [https://www.audible.com/series/The-Broken-Earth-Audiobooks/B017RGQXY6?ref=a\_ep\_hugo\_c8\_lSeries\_1\_4\_1&pf\_rd\_p=083645ee-5fd1-4af7-b9c4-2d88607bbe5f&pf\_rd\_r=QQYCRRZ8ZT7945E6HJKD](https://www.audible.com/series/The-Broken-Earth-Audiobooks/B017RGQXY6?ref=a_ep_hugo_c8_lSeries_1_4_1&pf_rd_p=083645ee-5fd1-4af7-b9c4-2d88607bbe5f&pf_rd_r=QQYCRRZ8ZT7945E6HJKD)

The Parable of the Sower was also incredible. The Earthseed concept is something I really love. I also enjoyed the way the story was told and how it was narrated.

I don't read that much straight fiction. It's usually scifi or fantasy or romance for me.

The Red Tent was very enjoyable. It was recommended to me by a friend. I am not super religious but I was fascinated by this book.

[Goodreads.com](https://Goodreads.com) is a great place to look at reviews and get recommendations. I like to go to a book I enjoyed and then follow down to see a reviewer that agreed. I go to their profile and see what other books they like and reviewed so that I can get more recommendations.  I like how audible has things set up but I also hate it because I feel like I see the same books over and over again."

curlyhair,fpno653,t1_fpnjr8i,1588768716.0,"I lived in the north of Spain for almost 2 months and real Spaniards would come ask me for directions! It shocked me so much. I have a very ambiguous ethnicity- no one knows what I am without asking.

People often think I’m Latina (which is cool with me because I love Hispanic culture!). Cuban or Italian is what people guess most often.


Also, my husband had tea tree oil shampoo at one point and that’s how I know it wasn’t good for me. It just stripped it terribly. 

Every so often (1x a month) I do a clarifying wash because I have well water and it’s got minerals that I need to get out.

Edit:
Before 1511 there were a lot of Jews in Spain and Portugal, so it makes sense!"
curlyhair,fpnfhkw,t1_fpmrofn,1588761087.0,Can I ask what your ethnicity is? I’m Jewish but my hair is very different from the rest of my family.
curlyhair,fpnf5mi,t1_fpmrofn,1588760761.0,"I used knot today products as well.

I have to be careful not to use too much product after the shower so that it doesn’t look greasy at the root or weighed down.

I think that the tea tree shampoo could be drying out your hair. I would maybe switch to something less harsh. I’m also not familiar with your conditioner.

I use shea moisture shampoo. I used to use diva curl no poo but it got all that bad press about making people hair fall out and it was so expensive, so I switched. I also used to use diva curl conditioners and have switched to combo of shea moisture conditioners (I love the smoothie kind) and also the knot today detangler conditioner just on the ends. 

For best results with no frizz. I wash with shampoo like once a week and condition it maybe 2-3 times. Try to finger bush when wet and avoid using a brush. 

So this is the real secret that I don’t do all the time but should do- it’s just a lot. You have to wash your hair upside down in the shower. Rinse it upside down and don’t scrub it. You need to squish it up towards your scalp. Then (while you have your hair hanging) take each curl and wrap it around your finger and give it a good squeeze. This will make the curls “stick “ together better. Finally (the worst part) rinse it with COLD water! This makes your hair “close up” and be less frizzy. 

I’m not really good with all the fancy terms is curly girls use on here, but that’s my method for best curls.

I work from home now, so most days my hair is in a messy bun staying out of the way!

Edit;
I forgot the end. When you exit the show before your plop- you need to use gel! Or the curling custard or whatever you like. I have the curling custard and I don’t think it’s as good as diva curl gel. With the hair sipping wet, you need to rub the gel into your hands (not too much! Like a quarter size or so) and use a combo of praying hands and scrunching to apply it. 

Once you apply gel, wrap/plop your hair in a microfiber towel or Cotten tshirt to dry for like 10-30 min, then air dry the rest or cold air diffuse it."

ZeroWaste,fp1whih,t3_gatdco,1588249727.0,"A few tips when inserting the cup...

Get it wet- I use water. 

Get off the toilet and squat down low or maybe put your leg up on the toilet - try different positions for better access

I always snip the end off. I hate the little tip and can always feel it. 

My cup doesn’t sit in there super high. 

I smash the cup flat, than I fold that in half and shove it up there, then I let it sort of pop open, and I spin it a little to make sure there is suction. I prefer to squat low to the ground for this as well.

I also had to get away from diva cup. That brand was too stiff for my liking. Moon cup silicon is a little softer. And of course you want to make sure your getting the correct size.

If your afraid that you won’t be able to get it out without the tip, it’s not hard! I just bear down like I’m taking a poo and usually can grab it from there.

The cup can be messy at first, so I would recommend dumping it in the shower and reinserting it in there as well. 



Thinx panties are awesome! I got some of those recently and got rid of the pads. Pads always irritated my skin, so this has been revolutionary. I wish I had gotten them sooner.


Edit: I boil my cup after every cycle. I know some ladies that boil it every night of their cycle. But I’m ok with just washing it with unscented soap when I pull it out."

AskWomen,foyckx6,t1_foybm2y,1588170029.0,"Looking back at it it’s more expensive than I led on...

The club near me charges:
1. $500 one time membership 

2. $991 annually for insurance for the aircraft

3. Monthly dues from $86-225 (it can go up because of annual inspections on the aircraft that are needed)

4. Hourly rates are $35/hr for the c-172 or PA-28-280, and $45/hr for the C-182 (IFR) 

5. $55/hr for flight instruction

6. Pay for your own gas at the end of each flight.

I guess the monthly dues can vary based on your membership level and that level determines which planes you can fly.

I’m not sure if it would be worth it to join as a newbie- looks like I have an excel spreadsheet to make in my future comparing all the clubs and basic rental fees.

Edit for clarity"
AskWomen,foybig2,t1_foyay5w,1588169440.0,"I’ll def be setting up my exploration flight soon.

Some of the flight clubs require you to do maintenance once a month + go to their monthly social. So it can be a big commitment.

I figure I better do it so I don’t have any regrets later on (and our insurance changed and will now cover one medicated cycle). 

But basically through all this hurt and pain, I decided that I needed to start doing something for me and that thing looks like it might be a PPL!

I am very very lucky to have private airport like 10 min away from my house and also it seems like there are a few ground schools to pick from that are also local. Aviation seems to be popular in my area and they have a few flight clubs around as well.

Sometimes you just need to start writing it out and then edit later. 

You can literally start it off with “My opinion on this novel is that it was...” then cut obvious “my opinion “ and go from there. The first paragraph frames the essay. You tell the reader what your going to cover in the body. Keep it simple stupid - talk like the reader has never heard of this book before and lay it out.

321,fm4cff5,t1_fm45d15,1585751358.0,"The markup on these delivery services is insane! I have just been cooking for myself and skipping deliver/take out all together. I go in and make an order on bitesquad every so often and always end up just going to get it myself because the cost of the service is crazy. You pay a delivery fee (which the driver doesn't get), a service fee, and then the food is marked up as well. 

&#x200B;

I always tip my delivery drivers pretty well, but these ""delivery"" services are outrageous with their mark-ups."

Honestly, I have given up over the past two years. I was planning to get back into a new office after my birthday in May (I wanted to take some trips and enjoy life a bit before baby making again). But now my vacations are cancelled and I probably can't get into a new doc for the foreseeable future.

ChickFilA,flay46w,t1_flaxj7q,1584993479.0,Good point! That’s why I stopped eating out. You just can’t be sure right now.
ChickFilA,flawthp,t1_flaravx,1584992724.0,"Not sure what you mean here. Rule number #1 of working in food is to not contaminate food with money. That's why the cashier is just at the register and you have someone else assigned to putting orders together. 

So yeah, when they have hundreds of people coming through the drive through that is something to be concerned about."

My bubbe had a cousin named Hyme (pronounce Hi-me in Jewish NY accent), I think it probably came from Chaim (which means Life!). From google - ""also transcribed Haim, Hayim, Chayim, or Chaim (English pronunciations: /haɪm/ **HYME**, /xaɪm/ KHYME, /ˈxɑːjiːm/ KHAH-yeem), is a **name** of Hebrew origin which means ""life"". Its first usage can be traced to the Middle Ages. It is a popular **name** among Jewish people.""

The last time I ate out was at Chick-fil-A maybe 2 weeks ago. The cashier took my card and then bagged my food 🤢. I understand why the two window system is used at many other fast food places now.

Normally, I wouldn’t think twice about it but in these scary times you have too!

Edit: trust me guys, I love Chick-fil-A! But that got me thinking twice about going there."
