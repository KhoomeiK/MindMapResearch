Not for not having social media, but because you probably indirectly offended your friend. You condescendingly told her that you wouldn’t want to date someone that sees lack of social media as a red flag DIRECTLY AFTER she had literally just told you that she sees it as a red flag. So. Yeah. YTA for laughing at your friend, especially when she was offering a suggestion."

My biggest question is how did you break yourself of this habit/craving? It’s a big emotional thing for me and honestly it feels like a fucking addiction. I’ll buy Hostess cupcakes at the gas station even though I know they’re not going to taste that good just because I HAVE to have sugar/a “treat.” Any tips on NOT doing this??"
