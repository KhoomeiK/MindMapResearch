They’re misinformed and constantly misled, they know not to be trusting because they’re consistently getting screwed, but the capitalists are convincing them even then that it’s this regulation or that minority. In this case, the capitalist media outlet Fox News has been campaigning against any sensible measures against COVID19, with their followers being the big ones against quarantine and everything else.

communism101,fnl8cq2,t3_g27sfx,1587048933.0,"While I haven’t read the book itself I think I can address your questions more broadly. Regarding the book, I’m vaguely aware that Sakai wasn’t actually a Marxist, but that doesn’t mean his work doesn’t come to useful conclusions. Go to the end for a tl;dr.

So first, white proletarians: I’ll come right out and say that I don’t believe that it’s impossible for white people to be proles. I do however believe it is much harder for white people to reach a revolutionary consciousness due to a vested interest in maintaining the current racial supremacy that has been taught into us fron early on. I can confirm this from on the ground organizing, as most everyone in my party has observed, white or not, that organizing in majority white areas is a bitch and a half since white people just don’t seem to live in the same world as everyone else, in large part to our position in colonial society.

Many white people are labor aristocracy in that we by and large have larger wages than any other racial group, as well as we tend to have an easier time in capitalist/colonial society and live in better conditions. I do believe that the labor aristocracy isn’t being maintained near as much anymore due to neoliberalism needing to extract as much money from the internal side of the empire as possible, and doing so without regard due to the USSR being gone. My analysis on white proles basically comes down to regardless of if you want to define all white people as labor aristocracy or allow us to hold the title proletarian, the material conditions of someone who can’t afford bread and has had to survive a month and a half off of a single vat of frozen soup and one dollar water only pancake mix while they watch congress raise their already overly inflated wages each year, that has the potential to radicalize someone. I’ve always personally maintained that the utility of being labor aristocracy only goes so far when one can’t afford food, water, or electricity. It should also be of note that just because someone isn’t proletarian doesn’t mean they can’t be revolutionary. Marx, Engels, Lenin, Mao, Che, all were bourgeoisie, and realized what the correct cause was and lent their time and energy to the cause of proletarian and colonized liberation. 

So call white people labor aristocracy, or to those that the term applies to, proletarian, white people have a reduced chance to form a revolutionary consciousness due entirely to where we sit in settler colonial society, this is clearly observable in one’s environment. The way to proceed for white people according to both certain colonized comrades online, as well as those I’m personally friends with, is for us to unite behind colonized leadership, reject whiteness and our attachment to it while acknowledging that until settler colonialism is destroyed we will still be white, as well as to tirelessly demand the right to self determination for all colonized nations. 

Now, regarding Sakai’s support of black separatism, this is entirely reachable through upholding the right to self determination for all colonized nations. I’m white, but I’m invested in my black wife’s liberation not just through our relationship, but due to the understanding that the black nation is still heavily colonized and attacked on all sides, and in no way am I going to tell people from the black nation that they don’t have a right to cut ties with their oppressor. You don’t have to be a certain race to understand and lend support to any given cause.

TL;DR: regardless of if white people are labor aristocracy or not, we white people do have it better under the current system and should be uniting under colonized leadership and tirelessly demanding the right to self determination. Reject whiteness and your attachment to it, settler colonialism must be destroyed and we mustn’t stand in the way of liberation for any nation."

While I’m solidly with the PSL, if the CPUSA has rejected their previous revisionism I want to have an accurate opinion of the party considering its rich history. What’s the recent on the ground activism been like? I know y’all have been more anti-revisionist in y’all’s rhetoric but I just genuinely haven’t seen any on the ground presence.

To be fair with regards to your international outreach, y’all existed in the time of the Third International and the Comintern. That alone would account for a good amount of international connections. We do have our international connections as well, since we heavily interact with many different parties all of the world, from Sudan to India to Venezuela to Cuba to the DPRK. I can only imagine how we will look as party when we get to y’alls age 😜."

I’m not going to write a big exposition since I’ve got COVID right now and don’t have the energy, but a few things we’ve been involved in/done ourselves. We’ve got [Occupy](https://liberationschool.org/can-make-revolution-lessons-egypt-occupy/) which we were involved in heavily. 

The [Embassy Protection Collective](https://www.liberationnews.org/support-the-embassy-protection-collective-resisting-trumps-war-on-venezuela/) had major participation from the PSL in the area, with our mass line organizations, the ANSWER Coalition and Code PINK, taking a major toll.

Our branch in Philadelphia runs the [Philadelphia Liberation Center](https://youtu.be/HpPaRiNL7to) which is another mass line organization that’s directly organized by the PSL and is openly socialist.

If you read our [campaign announcement](https://youtu.be/HpPaRiNL7), you’ll know our political campaigns aren’t meant to merely win reforms. It’s an extension of our broader strategy of participating in popular struggles and political events. Just as the Bolsheviks did, we participate in liberal activist groups not to make ourselves liberal, but to work from amongst the average progressives amongst the working class, hear their demands, fight for their demands but also encourage them to push for more radical change. The Bolshevik demand for peace, land, and bread was not to declare that was the end all be all of radical organizing, but to push for change and show the limits of the system in which we live.

In my own activities, of which I won’t list the city as we’re just getting started as of a little over a week ago and I don’t want to announce things so soon, but we’ve managed to create a workers council locally and will be using that as a base for organizing amongst the working class here as traditional agitation hadn’t made as much progress as one would hope. I will say I’m in rural Oklahoma at the very least.

These are just a few examples. If you’d like to learn more about us, learn from the actual membership. Aren’t marxists big on letting people speak for themselves? Let us speak for ourselves. We’re a democratic centralist, Marxist-Leninist party that has managed to organize massive matches against war in a remarkably pro-war country. We’re growing by the hundreds each week and have experienced and educated organizers in every part of the country, in every kind of occupation. We specifically organize for revolution. We’d welcome you to join us if you wish to experience us from within and argue for change if you see we need it.

Edit: changed some wording near the end."

LaborwaveAesthetics,fmllquu,t1_fmkk62u,1586188871.0,"It’s not the drugs themselves that destroy communities, as if you take a treatment based approach and eliminate the conditions that cause people to have to sell or consume drugs in the first place you won’t really have a problem. What hurts communities is being over exploited and under paid, leading to a desperate poverty in which something as bad as, let’s say meth, can suddenly become a viable option. Others become just as broke and fall into selling it, and now it’s a sustaining cycle in the community. 

The approach should be to eliminate or control conditions that lead to overdoses, provide clean needles so disease doesn’t spread, offer a path of state funded treatment so when they’re ready they can get clean, and ultimately eliminate the poverty that caused the issue in the first place. Drugs are almost always self medicating because the user isn’t getting what they need through normal channels. Treat the causes, don’t attack the person."

Edit: after checking with the person who had told me this, it appears that the order came from the Ural Regional Soviet to initially just kill the tsar, and the soldiers who carried out the order extended it to the rest of the Romanov family. Afterwards, 28 soldiers were tried and five were executed. He didn’t give me a specific source, just that this was what he had gathered reading through imperialist sources. I found a citation on the Wikipedia that links to some soviet encyclopedia, but it’s entirely in Russian so I can’t confirm what it says. Here’s the wikipedia article, which is rife with anti-communist garbage, but it does somewhat confirm what my friend had said, for whatever it’s worth that Wikipedia confirmed it:
