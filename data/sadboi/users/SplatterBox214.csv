ADHD,fkrwaxv,t3_fjwx0v,1584477320.0,"I had to learn how to overcome a nervous stutter that effected me all the way through high school and into my early 20’s. In grade school, I was the kid who would get sent into the hall for talking when everyone else seemed to know how to keep their mouths shut when the teacher asked. When anxiety kicked in, the person who constantly had their mouth running would disappear and a very fearful person would take his place - a person who could barely string together a coherent sentence when the time seriously called for it. 

I resonate with that girl. Trying to put together an answer when I was nervous sometimes just wouldn’t/couldn’t happen. I would stutter on certain words or certain sounds I had to make and would choke on the thought I was trying to convey. It was extremely embarrassing and I felt a lot of shame because a lot of my friends in high school performed exceptionally well in events like debate, the ACT, socializing, not blurting out unfiltered thoughts at the wrong time. 

I’m now 28, have been medicated properly with a beautiful cocktail of pills (had to get hospitalized from an alcohol overdose at .5BAC first, of course), and no longer stutter. In fact, I actually work over the phone setting appts for a solar company from home and talk with people all day. I became very good at my job and completely spun my stutter into a strength that will give me my career. 

It gets better."
adderall,fjtlx3g,t3_fecufi,1583608880.0,"For those who only need a subtle boost that lasts for quite a while (med says 12-14 hours, but for me it's more like 6-8), Vyvanse is perfect. For me personally, Vyvanse is was raises me to a baseline from where my Adderall IR can work properly. I take 70mg Vyvanse and 30mg Adderall IR every day, unless I decide to have an off day, but recently I've just been so damn busy that I haven't been able to afford an off day. I'm also on 4mg Intuniv. I have Select Health (ObamaCare, I think) and they cover all 3 of my meds, I only pay like $10-$15 bucks per prescription per month, and I'm pretty sure my policy has a $0 deductible. It's fairly easy to qualify for, I'd give it a look. They wouldn't cover Mydayis for me, though, which I really wanted to try because it's supposedly Adderall that lasts for like 16 hours and I have issues with tolerance and the meds metabolizing too fast.

adderall,fjkrc5o,t3_fdjx9g,1583432365.0,"I started on 60mg Vyvanse, and it worked for about a week. After that I felt the effects not lasting as long (my body personally adjusts to dosages and substances very quickly), so I felt like I needed to take more throughout the day so I could remain functional. I ended up taking 180mg in a day once and I didn't sleep until like 6-7am and my anxiety was through the roof with racing thoughts. I talked to my doctor about the medication working, but just not well enough for what I was getting on stimulant medication for. Long story short, I'm on 70mg Vyvanse, 4mg Intuniv and 30mg Adderall IR daily now and I feel functional all day and experience pretty minimal side effects - probably because I've been on this dosage for a few months now and my body is pretty used to what the medication does to my brain and has adjusted. I don't feel like I need to take more and I oddly don't really feel like drinking alcohol (my drug of choice to combat my adhd and other associated symptoms - depression/anxiety/hypomanic states, etc.). 

It's a process getting things dialed in, but it's worth it if it you can hit a sweet spot. Life is a lot better for me now and I have been able to keep my work performance up while also taking care of all of my other obligations, as well. Relationships with my girlfriend, family, and close friends have dramatically improved and I have been getting in front of issues before they become problems instead of doing absolutely nothing about them and practicing complete avoidance."

adderall,fj2it3p,t1_fj2i4hr,1582944761.0,"70mg Vyvanse is basically like 27.5mg Adderall (probably xr) after it's fully metabolized. It's a 12-14 hour med, so it's designed to metabolize a lot slower so it lasts longer, making the peak not nearly as high as with Adderall. It's a very gradual build up and a gradual come down. I like the combo of both because Vyvanse by itself doesn't quite do it for me, but it creates a good baseline for my Adderall to work from."

This combo seems to work the best for me as far as managing my symptoms, and it generally lasts all day, but it definitely depends on the day and what's in my stomach, etc."

I used alcohol to medicate those symptoms and ended up in the hospital from an alcohol overdose (clocked in at .5 BAC in the hospital). Since then, I've been honest with my doctors about my symptoms and have been able to get on a wonderful cocktail of 5 medications that keep me stable and functioning without alcohol. I've been sober for over 6 months now, and I used to be a daily drinker, sometimes 8-10 drinks per night, sometimes 15. I was really putting it away. Since becoming properly medicated for my symptoms, my urge to drink all the time has gotten much weaker over time and I don't really feel like I need to use alcohol to cover up my symptoms. I'll probably dip my toes back into drinking after about another 6 months to see how my body reacts, but as long as my meds are working, I don't really see me going back to way I used to drink. Hopefully that adds some clarity for you."

Pretty challenging game but it's just really fucking fun to finally get yourself an overpowered deck and just crush everything.

Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth is also a great rogue-like that gives you random dungeon layouts and random items every time you start a new game. Lots of characters to choose from.

stopdrinking,etlfbiz,t3_cc2tq8,1562934664.0,Very similar boat. I just hit 15 days today and I was a fairly heavy daily drinker for a solid 2 1/2 years. This shit is not easy. Going to AA meetings helps keep my head outta my ass.
alcoholism,eslwm5l,t1_eslu1dz,1562093632.0,"The AA meeting was actually held in a different place this week and I didn’t know. It was an NA meeting, so it was still good. I shared about how important it is to fill the void with something positive and to keep out of tempting situations."
MedicalGore,esltyb1,t1_esls7gn,1562092070.0,C’s get degree’s!
alcoholism,esltodp,t1_esjjx8d,1562091895.0,I still have a few bruises and cuts that will scar because of my drunken stupidity. Apparently I also screamed recklessly while blacked out and damaged my vocal cords. Pretty sure I was letting out suppressed emotional pain. Couldn’t speak correctly for like a week. Shit is so dangerous.
alcoholism,eslted7,t1_esjjx8d,1562091718.0,"The hardest part right now for me is filling my time with wholesome, positive things. I know it’ll come if I just avoid the bottle."
alcoholism,esltbj9,t1_esigeyh,1562091670.0,"I still get cravings, but it’s mostly out of habit. Although, I got a strong craving because of some extreme stress yesterday, but I shut that shit down, just like Negan."
