Also, without telling my entire story (and risking judgment or a conversation I just don’t want to have) I find it very hard to keep friends when the mania spikes. Mine manifests in just hyper irritability, anxiety, and outbursts of anger.. this is then followed by the insane emotional drop. Anyone else have tips on how to explain this without divulging everything?"

But, it’s getting better now that I put it near the window (not any night bc it’s way too cold) and stopped watering weekly. I’m at about every 2 weeks as well. Hoping the new growth will survive. So sad"

TheOutsider,fhwr80n,t1_fhw5gmx,1581926354.0,There’s info in the title .. read my post above that breaks down the lyrics in relation to the show
TheOutsider,fhwqzea,t3_f50bbb,1581926044.0,"Do I think we needed this episode? Initially I said no. It felt like a filler until I really started to break it down. It’s all about the little pieces.. the things we don’t see initially. If you just consume this show idly, this episode seems boring but there’s a lot to it.

For example, the title of the episode”in the pines, in the pines” is filled with information. I did some research on the song and found its an American folk song that goes back to the 1800s. The lyrics have changed over time depending on who is singing it but, they all share themes of darkness, death, and grief and involve a woman being interrogated. A train runs near the cold dark pines and has just killed/beheaded someone the woman cares about (her father depending on the version.) 

—The woman is being questioned about her behavior, which socially unacceptable behavior,
“Don't lie to me; where did you sleep last night?”
The answer is she stayed in the pines doing something she shouldn’t be doing. 
-Another version asks where she got her shoes and dress, to which she says, 
“from a man in the mines, who sleeps in the pines.""

Okay, back to the show.

You could take the title to just refer to the woods we goes back and forth into, where the dead animals are found and where the boy’s body is found. Every time we go to the woods, either death has occurred, is going to occur or is being  contemplated. Even that beetle has flipped on his back and Is seen struggling. (Which when they do that, there’s no going back. They’re dying)

  — Reminder— In the song, the pines represent extreme darkness, somewhere the girl should not be. Just outside, surrounding it, is inevitable death that comes as quickly as a speeding train, violently decapitating loved ones.—

So let’s say the pines/woods are death/El cuco, a very dark force that is going to violently kill, who survives in the forest, feeding off the darkness and death. This is where he’s able to take shape and grow. Also of note, when holly comes into contact with cuoco, it’s while she’s sleeping. In the song the girl slept in the pines and death followed. — by spending time searching for information, holly, and everyone she cares about or knows is at risk.
 
Furthermore, like the song, Holly gets interrogated for what she’s doing, her questionable methods, and 
Paranormal findings (all of which at least at the beginning were socially unaccepted.) Her research is  also a direct threat to el cuoco. Aka he doesn’t find what she’s doing okay either. 

In short — the episode and song just reminds us time and time again that Holly is in danger by digging around. Death is coming and quickly. When it happens, get ready, it’s going to be brutal. 

So essentially, this episode just kept reiterating what we already knew. 

I just wish it would hurry up!!"
