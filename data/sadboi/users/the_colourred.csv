Iron Maiden - Steve Harris is considered a legend in metal bass. And they've had a 3 guitar + bass line up for years now. But are probably aren't as heavy as you're looking for.

Most thrash metal has 2 guitars and a bass. Metallica, Megadeth from the old school era and newer bands like Havok, Power Trip would be good references.

Mastodon, Lamb Of God and Gojira - Heavy two guitar and bass line up, very often downtuned. Groovy as hell, they've got riffs for days arguably three of the best modern metal bands.

Try this, looks like a boss cs-2 and and TS-808 for drive, and some version of a big muff for fuzz.

Two pointers I want to bring up though - 

A lot of pros have their gear modded, making a well known pedal sound different from its stock version and the same pedal may not get you the same sound

Steven Wilson has said, that the sound on a recording is a mix of a live rig and studio magic, so again the gear alone won't get you there

But you'll probably be able to get to a ballpark sound. Hope this was helpful."
changemyview,fomqtjq,t3_g84fsc,1587900540.0,"I'm from India, we have a totally different ball game. There's only a few small and midsize parties that even need public funding. The big one's don't really need that because they're all in the pockets of various large corporations/families.

It's a far more corrupt system. It's openly accepted that either of the two biggest parties which kind of mirror the democrats and republicans pay people to vote for them, often not even discreetly. I don't really think it makes a difference who funds them at this point because they don't care about anything but their own agendas.

Coming back to the CMV, if we want to level the playing field for the small and mid sized parties mentioned earlier, they simply will not have the backing to compete against the older more established parties on public funding alone, they will need corporate funding to do this, and one will just have to hope that they'll honour their integrity."

The expectation was that when we fix the issue, the ticket is assigned to the testing team, and an email is sent to them. I wasn't aware about the email bit and would just send the tickets back.
For whatever reason the testing team's manager decided to pick on me during the team meeting that day, and he went on for a few minutes, repeating the same thing over and over again, I responded saying that I would do it from then on, but he didn't stop. He went on to join his hands and mockingly plead with me to do what he asked.
