Do you search for new tracks to add into your playlist ? I'm also an unknown artist, although I don't get even 10k listens, but maybe you'll like my music and give it a listen when you have free time. Have a great day, once again great playlist !

Shame,fq7so7b,t3_g5msyr,1589151401.0,"I think you're trying too hard to find love in your bf. If you have trust problem, than that's probably means that you have a bad loving affair and you don't feel enough love, so you don't feel safe with him and you have trust problems. If your bf is a great loving guy, than it means the problem is in you. Don't feel ashamed its OK to have trust problems. The thing is if the problem is in you, you have to work within yourself. You're really afraid that his into these girls and the worst is you're comparing yourself to them. I think you should talk about this with him, if you guys really are in a good relationship he'll understand and feel compassion towards you and he'll try to help you out. If he will reject you, than that relationship wasn't even going anywhere in a first place. The guy must try to help you and make you feel safe. Feel free to  message me, if you still have questions. I used to have depression and I committed two suicide attempts in my life, so trust me, I know this topic. Also don't feel shame for your self pleasure you didn't know she's 19 and the fact that you feel ashamed for this is telling me that you wouldn't have done this if you knew it. Its just masturbation you didnt caused harm to anyone. You're a good person. Have a great day !"
