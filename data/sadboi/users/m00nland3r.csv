I, on the other, recently finished my MBA with the goal of pivoting out of sales and into more product and marketing related roles. Unfortunately, many of the interviews I've had ended when they pigeonholed me as a salesman. An MBA has made zero difference in the 10 interviews I've had (with many different kinds of companies). 'Once a salesman, always a salesman,' they seem to believe.

Now, this is just my experience, so maybe it will be different for you. But before you go spend a ton of time and money on an MBA, see if you can achieve your goals without making such a massive sacrifice."

CatastrophicFailure,fqwchb1,t3_gl6y9g,1589699573.0,"I lived in London when this happened. It was crazy heading to work and seeing this giant plume of thick black smoke rising up out of the Western part of the city. Having grown up in NY when 9/11 happened, I had an eerily familiar feeling - as if many people had just died. When I got to work and found out what all the smoke was about...it was an awful feeling to say the least.

The reports said something like 70 people died, but that number is really just a guess, from what I understand. There is no way of knowing since it's likely that the building was housing many undocumented people. Some suggest it could've been closer to 200.

Months after this, while the building was still charred and exposed - really quite naked and horrifying, especially in contrast to the other neighboring buildings - I was standing on the tube platform at Ladbroke Grove. A pre-recorded announcement had come on asking people not to take in decent photos of the building. 

I thought that was pretty interesting. Eventually they wrapped the whole thing up so that giant reminder of death, like a giant ashen cigarette standing upright, could be out of sight and out of mind."

Sciatica,fqt6tb5,t3_gksijl,1589631740.0,"Yes, agreed. Long journey ahead. Are you wearing a brace? I kept mine on for 2 weeks post-surgery so that I wouldn't accidently bend. It's really the bend-lift-twist motion that will do you in, so avoid that at all costs.
To give you some comfort, I had a damn near fully sequestered L5/S1 and while the pain was reduced significantly after the surgery, it took many months before I felt any semblance of normal. Also, don't forget how low your tolerance for pain is at the moment. Nerves take a long fucking time to heal, but the good thing is that they should do exactly that: heal. 

My recommendation to anyone in your situation is to keep a pain journal. Even if it's a number under each day, just something to log your pain so you can benchmark each day against the last. I did this when I was certain I had re-herniated (got two MRI's bc the paranoia was that bad) and ultimately felt much better when I started seeing 6/10 pain days turn into 5/10, 4/10, and on and on. 

One more thing to consider here is your mental health. How often are you so incredibly consumed with one intensely negative thing in the same way that nerve pain dominates your every minute of every day? Rarely, I would presume. Imagine what it would be like to experience pleasant feelings, like an orgasm, every minute of every day! Surely you'd have a big wet smile on your face. Sadly, pain is often more persistent than pleasure. Remember this when your thoughts begin to sink. It's persistent, but don't give in. Read, meditate, masturbate, learn something. Whatever. Just seek positive modes. Just get your mind off your damn pain. It grows when you give it attention. 

Best of luck. I don't envy your situation but only because I know it intimately and have worked hard and waited long to get out of it."
Sciatica,fqr4cfd,t1_fqr0pag,1589577352.0,"I agree with this, but would also like to add that you should avoid the chiropractor, too. It's been my experience that they have no effective means of dealing with herniated discs, and can actually make them worse. I am sure others will disagree, but that's my opinion. 

Stick with a physio and for God sake don't bend, lift, or twist anything for a while. Just don't do it. If you think the pain is bad now, try sequestering a disc. Then you will know no limit to pain!

P.s. good luck!"

Sciatica,fpvc469,t1_fpty5qp,1588941292.0,"I think it's normal. My physio explained that for every millimeter of nerve damage you can tack on 1-2 weeks of recovery. After my microdisectomy (L5/S1 - severe sequestration) the residual pain lasted months. It got so bad I thought I had re-herniated and had to get 2 MRIs (one with contrast) just to be sure. Turned it out to be a minor cyst on the disc (bc fuck me, right?!) And it eventually went away. I still deal with piriformis syndrome but it's much more manageable and doesn't make me want to kill myself (not joking, I was suicidal given the amount of pain I was in, hopefully you can't relate). 
In hindsight, there was no other option for me. The surgery was a MUST. 
One last thing, according to my physio, being in a chronic condition of pain actually lowers your tolerance. So it's possible that you are hyper sensitive to the nerve pain even though it's mostly repaired. It's been nearly 2 years since my operation and I am still at about 2-3/10 pain wise everyday. At my worst, it was 10/10 blackout pain. That really sucked!"

InjectionMolding,fp92t98,t1_fp92bpg,1588412133.0,"From what I gather, resin casting is very similar to what we did (we used silicone as the casting agent since we needed something that was food-grade).

The project was a tray with 24 cavities (8x3). We started with a 3d printed 'master' that was inverted (think of an ice tray that is turned upside-down). Then we used that to pour over the silicone (which, when finished, looked like a normal ice tray). 

This worked well because a) we only need one master tray b) we were able to customize everything about the design and c) it was super cheap. The end result was absolutely amazing.

Full disclosure, I am not the engineer. In fact, I met a nice gent thru reddit who did all of this for me, although I was heavily involved in the design and concept building stages.
