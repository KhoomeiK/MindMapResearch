By the time I thought I escaped, I was hiding behind the counter of a food service building about to cry, hung up on whoever I was talking to.

While they are parasitic, there is generally no harm done to the trees and fungi they steal nutrients from.

mycology,fkhhfmf,t1_fkg2elz,1584198903.0,"I would guess either a slime mold or a parasite of some kind. Yours look more like young trametes ochracea to me, but I’m unfamiliar with the bots recommendation (if you can get a shot of the under side- tough With the way they’re growing- it would help id). Another thought would be spores from artillery fungus. Were these near mulch? Edit: I take it back.. conchifer does seem correct, they tend to grow this way :)"
mycology,fkfsc1q,t3_fi1vq4,1584141374.0,I think the speckles on yours are something other than fungus/something separate from the mushroom (trametes seems right) but honestly I don’t know what it could be
