Gorditas, anything carnitas, sopes.

Also chamoy is incredible, it’s really good on mango sprinkled with tajin (a seasoning w/ lime, cayenne, etc). I honestly put it on all fruits.

I also make a mango strawberry soda and drizzle chamoy and tajin on it, it is fkn incredible."

That being said, I make the extra effort to be hydrated and well-fed to be safe. If you want to continue drinking coffee, try making sure that you're only consuming it when you've had a good night's sleep and everything else is kosher.

I'd also keep in mind the fact that caffeine affects each individual differently. Some folks can't even handle the teensy-tiny amount left over in decaf. You'll get a lot of different answers here but in the end, it's only about what \*your\* body can handle."
AmItheAsshole,ey5n5ot,t3_cvd2zx,1566835713.0,"NTA - this is a tough situation! I have borderline personality disorder/bipolar, and I reacted a lot like this when I was younger. It is extremely difficult to regulate borderline personality and even treat it, but your sister needs to be making the effort with the support of your parents. It's unrealistic to expect people to simply give borderline folks a pass because of their illness - in fact, that itself becomes a coping mechanism that makes the illness worse (helllooo, enabling). 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Honestly, your mom should have let you go to yoga because a cool-down period for your sister would have been really helpful.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That being said, empathy for your sister is important. BPD folx treat people very poorly when they're upset/at peak emotion, *especially* when untreated, yet recognize it after the moment has passed and experience a lot of related guilt. I 100% believe that this gives us BPD folx a great capacity for love and understanding when emotion is properly regulated. But this doesn't give you a pass for hurting other individuals! The best thing for BPD folx is learning to understand and experience the repercussions of their actions. As a family member, you can help greatly by offering grace and helping them realize the danger of their actions with abandoning them...but not at the expense of your own mental health! If you need to spend time away from your family and recharge (thus making you more able to empathize IMO), that's 100% okay and likely very helpful for all parties.

&#x200B;

P.S. Sounds like your sister could benefit from DBT therapy."

Epilepsy,eub09wg,t3_cfmnmw,1563636588.0,"I believe it can. I went undiagnosed w/ primary generalize/JME for years because I was taking lamictal for bipolar disorder. I skipped a few doses by accident while partying waaay too hard on vacation and getting by on 4-6 hours of sleep, and ended up having a tonic-clonic while driving.

I can’t speak to medicines and their side effects/efficiency, but I will say that outside stressors and not taking care of myself triggered the tonic-clonic. I’ve been seizure-free for a while now and keep a very routined schedule for extra caution."
