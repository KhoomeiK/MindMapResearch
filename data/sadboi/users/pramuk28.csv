UberEATS,feph0gw,t1_fepgrqy,1579320270.0,At my local maccas the system gets taken out and the employees doesn‚Äôt even know the orders coming thru and the delivery ppl have to go tell the workers and they manually start entering and prepare the food but in ur case its something else. Maybe there was a mistake done by the manager which is to stop taking orders after certain time or a specific day.
