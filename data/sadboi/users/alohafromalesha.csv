Once there was a hot wheels car that one of the kiddos sucked up and I was able to use a Phillips screwdriver and took it apart to get it out. One of the filters can be taken out and handwashed. The air filter can be easily replaced if need be and it has an indicator that shows when it needs to be replaced or if something is blocking the air flow. This is a cheap and reliable machine!
