SingleParents,fr1ifjl,t1_fr1h840,1589820278.0,"She is back now, it was the initial shock of going from basically living with him to going back home.  We got used to being by one another’s side to just taking thru text and phone. I went thru 2 years intense therapy. I don’t think it’s. A death sentence, my daughter saved my life. I wouldn’t be a nurse or have a fulfilling life had I not had her. Hence why I’d rather spend my time focused on raising her than be selfish and date. Which is why if it doesn’t work with him we will go back to how it was before"
SingleParents,fr1gs26,t1_fr1ff16,1589819456.0,"I understand, if it doesn’t work out with him though then I’ll just go back to being single, as I have been the last 11 years before this guy. Everyone says oh get a babysitter as if that $$ doesn’t add up. I break even as it is being a single parent getting no child support or financial assistance. I can’t afford that. Honestly would rather hang home and chill with my daughter anyway. I’ll be content either way"
SingleParents,fr1a90j,t1_fr01wrg,1589816154.0,"Well it’s not dick I want, I want companionship, a teammate. Last thing I want is causal sex, or as I call it, masturbating with a body.  Rather just masturbate alone and save myself the std risk. We had a good talk today about how he wasn’t ending things, he was expressing his frustration he missed me and wanted to see me again. We both agreed to make this work as we are invested in this."

SingleParents,fr19ne0,t1_fr0f6ab,1589815845.0,"Well one of the main reasons he wanted to meet me was bc he knew I was a single mom and he has a daughter as well. I went from basically living there for 2 months to going back to my place and I don’t think we was prepared for the initial sense of loss he’d feel. We had spoken about this before and talked this morning about how we have to both put forth the effort to make this work as we care for each other deeply. Hope we can, we will see."
SingleParents,fr19d3o,t1_fr0o4g8,1589815694.0,"Thank you. We talked and are both willing to make this work with our daughters and schedules .

SingleParents,fr194o6,t1_fr0mld8,1589815572.0,"Thank you for your response, we talked and decided we’re going to prioritize the relationship and both make the effort to make it work. He was simply frustrated about missing me and not seeing me. It’s an adjustment from me basically living there for 2 months to now me being back home but we had discussed this before how we’d make it work.  I think he wasn’t prepared for the sense of loss he’d feel once it actually happened. Hopefully we will make it work."
SingleParents,fr18tw1,t1_fr0r3g2,1589815413.0,"Well honestly Dating was not on my radar before I met this guy. I was content just working and in my free time spending it with my daughter. I don’t get child support or any financial assistance of any kind so babysitting gets too expensive when I’d have more fun staying home watching movies with my daughter. I break even at the month as it is now. I talked to him this morning, he clarified he by no means was trying to end things, he was expressing frustration about not being able to see me and not knowing when he would again.  We agreed we would make it work and each put forth the effort to prioritize the relationship while putting the kids first. However if it doesn’t work out I’ll just enjoy the time I have off work with my daughter as I had before."

Hopefully we can do this, only time will tell. Thank you for your reply"
SingleParents,fr1565h,t1_fr0f6ab,1589813458.0,"This is what we had discussed before. We both have busy schedules with our daughters and we both are working professionals. He told me this morning he wasn’t by any means talking about ending things, he was just expressing frustration about missing me and was mad he wasn’t sure when we would see one another again. Hopefully we will be able to make it work. Thank you for the reply."
SingleParents,fr14xr0,t1_fr00e1p,1589813331.0,Thank you for the advice. We spoke today and he clarified he was only expressing frustration about not seeing me since we had been together so long and I was basically living there. It’s an adjustment and we are going to do our beat to work through it. Hopefully he will be the right person for my situation but only time will tell.
SingleParents,fr13570,t1_fr10jg1,1589812341.0,"Well he has a daughter only 3 years younger than mine, they even share the same birthday.  To be honest before I had met him I had accepted I was going to stay single and once my daughter was out of the house I would travel and experience things I’ve wanted to do. I was completely content with being single and not worrying about dating or finding someone one day. We talked this morning and he told me he wasn’t breaking up with me, he was frustrated and not happy about missing me. We agreed to figure this out as we have had many talks before about how the kids are most important and come first and we would be a family. Only time will tell. Thank you for your kind words"
SingleParents,fr105a1,t1_fr0rt0y,1589810615.0,Wow I cannot imagine how hard that is. Yeah if it doesn’t work out with him I will just be done with dating til my daughter is out of the house.

dating_advice,fqyith7,t3_gll252,1589749273.0,It’s fine to have preferences. I’m a single mother myself and I’m not at all offended by this in the least bit.  It’s great to know what you want and what you’re not willing to compromise on.  Better to establish that from the get go than string someone along that you don’t see a future with.
AskWomen,fongbag,t3_g8d3f2,1587918941.0,"I was 29, single mother to an 11yr old daughter.  I hadn’t really dated since having her at 18 due to being busy raising her, school, moving to a different state. I had come to accept I just wouldn’t date til she was 18 and out of the house, if I even ended up dating at all.

I’m a nurse and one of the doctors I worked with had a patient come to his clinic who was a single father and mentioned he was looking for a nice girl. Well the doctor and his girlfriend who helped run the office gave him my number, we met for quick coffee to meet face to face and had a pleasant conversation about our daughters, jobs, and connected about the struggles of dating as a single parent. 

Then we went on an official first date which was only supposed to be lunch then turned into 3 days of me staying with him.  Been with him ever since and couldn’t be happier."

The biggest thing is keeping a positive attitude when I get home from 13+ hour shifts so my daughter and I can sit down at the table, have dinner and enjoy an hour or together before we have to get ready for bed to wake up and do it all over again.
