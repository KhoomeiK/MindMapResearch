 Washington state residents who complained about businesses violating lockdown measures received violent threats after stay-at-home protesters shared their personal information on Facebook.

One woman from King County, who submitted a complaint and was later on the list shared by the **Washington Three Percenters**, said that she immediately began receiving threats via email and phone messages. She asked to remain anonymous out of fear she would receive further threats.

In one phone message, reviewed by the *Times*, a man can be heard saying: ""You got 48 hours to get the \[expletive\] out of Washington, or **I am coming for you, and your loved ones.**"" Another female harasser told her in a voice message: ""I hope you choke on the \[expletive\] virus."""
