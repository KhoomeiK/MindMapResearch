pokemon,fcpby3b,t1_fcpbfa3,1577857654.0,"ORAS is really not that much harder than X honestly, and it's usually considered better. Pokémon in general is not very hard as far as jrpgs go, but Gen VI games in particular (X/Y and ORAS) are the easiest."
pokemon,fcpbfy4,t1_fcpb3xq,1577857131.0,"Yeah. I mean, you can easily see if a stone works on a Pokémon, but why would I trade a Feebas holding a Prism Scale?"
pokemon,fcp9x7l,t1_fcp9mxf,1577855582.0,"I would say Moon, although Ultra Moon has more content I think, but arguably worse story than Moon. Also, consider ORAS over X/Y."
