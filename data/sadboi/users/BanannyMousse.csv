Other people clearly think you’re oddly close. So even though nothing inappropriate has happened, you’re clearly leaving no for for him to have a full romantic relationship in his life. You seem to be the number 1 woman in his life. Whether you tell him what the GF did is up to you. Honestly, I hope they break up. She needs to move on."

You can make smoothies or country gravy, for example, with soy milk. You can make practically anything with tofu if you like. Plenty of dishes, like chili or tacos can be made with beans. Then there are pasta dishes that don’t need meat. You can also buy pasta made of lentils, which is high protein and tastes amazing. You can add veggies to those to make them more interesting. Personally, I cook a lot of easy Thai and Indian dishes, and no meat is required. The protein is normally eggs, cashews, whole grain rice, brown basmati rice, and/or tofu."
