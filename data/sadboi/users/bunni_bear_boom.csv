I can see your point, just seems like we all tend to get down on ourselves and I think you deserve credit. Really tho its just sematics or a diffent perspective either way good for you"
raisedbynarcissists,fm5g7kb,t3_ft2fup,1585772358.0,"It can also make us hypervigilent, scared of not pleasing others, prone to hiding our feelings and letting others push us around, or go the opposite way and make us full of bravado or passive aggressiveness because that is the example that we were shown. I'm not trying to be a downer here or call you any of these things OP. I just think that if we understand and acknowledge all the different ways trauma can affect us it allows us to be more gentle with ourselves when we notice these traits as well as letting us be proud of the choices we make to overcome them and be our best selves. Your moms treatment didn't make you kind YOU made you kind because you took a bad situation and used it to grow"
knitting,fm54kmn,t3_fsydh2,1585766219.0,I loooove my red lace chiagoos. To be fair they are my first and only set of needles that weren't blunt tips from hobby lobby or JoAnn's or something and first use able circulars. They were expensive but I think they were extremely worth it. They strain my fingers way less than my old ones did they were the fist circulars that I tried that I didn't have to fight with the cable and they completely converted me from greatly preferring DPNs to circulars. The only thing I don't like is they have a tendency to unscrew while knitting if you just use the key but I got the rubber gripper with the mini set and that has all but stopped that problem
knitting,fm53g5s,t3_ft2py8,1585765631.0,Yep. I got stuck on a worsted weight bag because its so pretty but now my pinky feels weird when I straighten it
raisedbynarcissists,fm12hem,t3_fs5frq,1585670780.0,Yep. I was always the last kid to be picked up. I usually just walked 2 hra home and I lived by Chicago so there was often a foot of snow to walk through

casualknitting,fly2qvh,t3_frolyk,1585594459.0,Straight needles make for decent makeshift back scratchers that's honestly the only thing I use them for these days
