SeriousConversation,fm2avh7,t1_fm06qjh,1585693833.0,"Some women have tighter vaginas or difficulty relaxing enough to expand for penetration. So having less girth will actually be preferred for some women. Also, keep in mind that women don't choose a partner primarily based on the size/girth of their dick. I've been out with men who were incredibly long and/or girthy. We did not end up in a relationship because of other more important factors like emotional availability. 

If you think that no woman can accept you because of your penis, then it's absolutely true. Your brain won't even recognize when women are interested because you believe it can't be true. And even if you do know someone is interested in you, you won't be able to trust that they really are because of your beliefs.

You may want to think about giving casual sex a try and have a few one night stands. When the whole point is that you won't see the person again, that takes the pressure off because it's no longer about the person accepting or rejecting you. Get out there, have some sex, learn fun stuff, and enjoy yourself! 

Another thing that may help is confronting your beliefs with evidence to the contrary. There's very likely a subreddit where average guys post pics of themselves. Go see the incredible variety in size/shape/girth. Find dicks like yours and ask their owners if they're in a relationship. I'd bet they are.

When you do feel ready to look for a relationship, look for someone who is a very kind and accepting person. Spend some time getting to know the person before you get intimate. 

And finally, your dick size is only a big deal if you make it a big deal. I grew up a very conservative Christian and didn't have sex for the first time until I was in my mid-thirties. I started online dating with very little sexual experience. I never mentioned it unless it came up, and then I just matter of factly told them that I had less experience than the average girl because of my upbringing. No details. I had sex with several guys without telling them this, and they never commented on my experience level. I could've made it into a huge deal and made it super awkward, but I didn't. And because of that, it wasn't awkward. It was just one thing about me, just like the fact that I've been to 5 of the 7 continents. It didn't define me, and I didn't let it hold me back."

datingoverthirty,fjyqrcs,t3_ffin4j,1583702567.0,"That's true love! I'm too broke to stock up, so I'm relying on my bf to keep me alive, or at least share toilet paper"
AgeGap,fjxtg0l,t3_ffb70w,1583682938.0,"Sounds like they are emotionally unavailable. You can find that at any age. Back when I was online dating, a lot of the men I ran across were emotional unavailable, which is part is why they were single. You begin to see patterns and notice red flags, but it's not something you can ""prevent"" or always see right away. The best thing you can do is make sure you're emotionally healthy and maintaining good boundaries. That, in itself, often does a great job filtering people out."

AnxiousAttachment,fjxrwot,t1_fjpwk56,1583681904.0,"Sure, it could. But someone with anxious attachment will tend to have weak/no boundaries and take responsibility for things the other person should be taking responsibility for. An anxious person often goes way to the other end of the spectrum and ""bends over backwards"" for the other person."
houseplants,fjw929p,t3_feynls,1583636711.0,"My current bf came over to my place when we first started hanging out. He already knew that I had a lot of plants, but when he saw the full extent of it, he was stunned and almost speechless. I honestly thought I wasn't gonna hear from him again. Thankfully I was wrong!"
AgeGap,fjpkcb3,t3_feldhu,1583553128.0,It would be weirder if she said no to free tickets and a chance to see her mom and friends.

exchristian,fjl532o,t3_fe098f,1583440086.0,"Most of this ""prophecy"" has yet to be ""fulfilled,"" so they don't have much to go on. Is Coronavirus resisting all known treatment? Last i heard they were working on a vaccine. Has it vanished suddenly?"

AnxiousAttachment,fjijgbn,t3_fdiam7,1583368980.0,"Being in tune with a partner's emotional states and responding in a nurturing way is a key characteristic of secure attachment. Also, he explains himself when you ask him and is up front about what he's thinking/feeling rather than blaming, attacking, or distancing, which are characteristics of avoidant attachment. 

Unless you are securely attached, a partner's reassurance will almost never be enough. (I know from experience) You have to develop that secure base within yourself to be able to take in his reassurances."
AnxiousAttachment,fjiiqzn,t3_fd6dup,1583368534.0,"I'm in a relationship with a secure guy (finally!) and I've noticed that sometimes my brain will start telling me that things are boring. I realized, though, that it's another protective strategy to subconsciously sabotage myself. When I started dating him, I had so many doubts and fears that whenever the fears came, I decided I had to stay for at least 3 months and really see if my fears came true, rather than jumping ship. So when I started feeling bored, I reminded myself of the 3 months and just stayed the course. The feeling went away, and I'm so glad i stayed!"
AnxiousAttachment,fjf0p4k,t1_fjeb9gi,1583281814.0,"It is very hard! But undoing that programming and building new beliefs is what helps us begin to move toward an earned secure attachment. If we keep doing the same thing, we'll keep getting the same results. Finding the baby steps that work for you are key. It's also important to remember that if your partner has a secure attachment style, they will mean what they say and be forthright about their feelings."
