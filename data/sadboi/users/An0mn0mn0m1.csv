I had had a glass of wine two hours before and all the triage nurse could focus on was that--just assumed I was drunk and dizzy. After waiting for 8 hours, I finally got a bed and hooked up to fluids. A nurse walked in, took one look at me, and immediately ordered rush blood work. Had a hemoglobin level of 3.4 (normal is 12-15). Don't really remember the rest because I passed out shortly after that--ended up needing an eventual 5 units of blood, depo injection, and an iron infusion to get me stable enough (needed hemoglobin of 8+) for surgery to take the offending fibroids out.

TalkTherapy,fc5tuiz,t3_efbmmq,1577465752.0,"I have a diagnosed eating disorder.   


My eating patterns are disordered. But so are my thoughts, drive, reasons, etc.  


I look at disordered eating as a diet taken a step or two too far--the goal was weight loss and perhaps it was achieved in a unhealthy way. Or it was overly restrictive which led to binge eating. Generally more clear cut, influenced by ""diet culture"" (god I hate that term), less mental/emotional involvement.  


My eating disorder is an entirely different beast. I know my perception of my body is screwed up, I know I'm being illogical, but I can't stop myself. I know I'm risking my health. It was never about losing weight. I never woke up and said ""you know what, I just want to be thin and beautiful and I'm just not going to eat, even if it kills me."" For me, my eating disorder has been driven by a sense of never being good enough, never feeling like I fit in, wanting to blend in and disappear into the background."
science,faiynnr,t1_faiqs9d,1576119797.0,"I’m not talking about physical pain either. I’m talking about the level of mental torture that it is when you’re trying to recover from a restrictive eating disorder and “eat more” is presented to you as the solution. I have been trying to recover from anorexia for the past 3 years. I am also a PhD educated scientist from one of the top 5 universities in my field in the US. You think I haven’t already tried just “eating more?”

My disorder is not thinking anything. It is not a separate entity. Speaking from my experience, it has become harder and harder to avoid things that trigger that obsessional part of my brain—calorie counts on every goddamn menu is one good example. Could I have looked that information up in the past or asked the restaurant for it? Yes. But sitting down to pick a meal (already a big thing I’ve worked to overcome) AND then getting slapped in the face by the fact that that one dish has more calories in it a than I’d previously eat in a day (around 500. For a year. Wouldn’t recommend it.)? I don’t need that. I’ve worked my ass off to get to a place where that doesn’t automatically send me into a tailspin and a help in that is sticking to either restaurants I’m familiar enough with that I just don’t even look at the menu or small places that don’t do it. Sure, I could just “get over it” or not go out to eat with my husband or friends but that’s isolating myself from the life I’ve tried to build. By that logic, just tell fat people the same.

Or, since the cure for anorexia is just eating more, why can’t the cure for obesity be “just eat less”?"
science,faimn4j,t1_faieojg,1576111540.0,"Sure, the solution is easy to you. Just eat more. What about when eating more feels like being asked to swallow a swarm of bees?

I hope no one you’re close to ever develops an eating disorder. That perspective, the “just eat more, it’s easy” perspective, is SO damaging to those struggling. Like yes I know I need to eat more but I literally can’t. I can’t make myself do it. I am terrified and I know it’s illogical but it feels so real and I can’t."

science,fai3rw1,t1_fahumeo,1576099241.0,"No, anorexia doesn't happen because you realize you need to exercise to eat a brownie. As a recovering anorexic (and also a PhD-holding scientist from a top 5 program in the US with a strong understanding of how metabolism works), my eating disorder had nothing to do with counting calories or controlling my weight. Until I was so far gone and so far in, that was the only thing that seemed at all logical.   


I lived for almost a year on 600 calories/day (not ""600"" really meaning 1200-1500 but 600 meaning probably closer to 400 because I would overestimate everything). I have watched close friends die from this disease. I have spent 3 years (and counting) in intensive therapy and nutritional monitoring. I've spent a total of 9 months in inpatient level facilities. While things like this didn't *start* my eating disorder, calories on menus *still* give me pause and takes careful thought to not just automatically go for the lowest option (and yes, back in the depths of my illness, I would look at menus in advance, figure out what I could eat and how much, and what I could eat ahead of time). Something like this would literally put it right in my face. Potentially even on foods that are ""safe."" I don't need to know that I need to walk for an hour to burn off an apple. No one does. Also these numbers would be SO ARBITRARY. Based on height/weight/sex/BMR. I'm 5'9"" and 135lbs. Ideally, I'd gain 10lbs but my metabolism is out of control right now--I lose weight eating any less than 3000 calories a day with a fairly sedentary job (on my feet and moving but also sitting a whole lot) and a 45min yoga class/week."

Recent studies have actually shown that being underweight (and I don't actually think it was the standard sub BMI 18.5 = underweight, I think they used BMI < 20)  is actually associated with far more health complications than being somewhat overweight and that the ""healthiest"" people were those with what is considered an overweight BMI (I believe it was BMI 25-27). It wasn't until you started to get into the morbidly obese category that similar rates of severe weight-related complications matched the rates in the underweight (BMI < 20) category."

Pseudo-science in the realm of dietary supplements that can do \*insert outrageous claim here\* is blowing up and it's fucking dangerous. Sure, I get it, sometimes MDs tend to stay too ""old school"" and by evidenced-based practices (but wait....isn't that what a good therapist should do too??) but many that I've interacted with are also starting to embrace the idea that they can't fix everything and are advocates for their patient's to explore alternative treatments. If there's something you can do in this situation, it is to help your patient figure out how to advocate for herself with her neurologist about her experiences on various medications and ask herself about the colostrum if that's something she'd like to try. Or, alternatively, you could help support her in finding a new neurologist that might be able to look at things from a different angle."

EatingDisorders,eywdxkr,t3_cz47l6,1567527237.0,"Learning how to respond to those types of questions and how to best support me in my recovery has been a challenge for my husband as well. Honestly, for me, when I ask those types of questions, I've already decided that yes I am and I hate my body and nothing will change that--it's usually coming from a place of being totally overwhelmed and stressed out and feeling like I'll never be enough. What's most helpful to hear is a ""hey, what's up? I think you look great, I love the way your \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ looks in that."" It feels less dismissive and more honest than just a ""you're not fat"" which is easy for me to brush off as him just telling me what I want to hear (and leads to me getting more frustrated). It also opens the door for me to state what's actually on my mind (sometimes it's just a ""I look terrible, I can't figure out what to wear"" other times, it provides me an opportunity to reflect on what might be giving me a case of the overwhelm-ies).  


Another thing that I SUPER appreciate when my husband does is just randomly compliment me on my body--especially areas/aspects of it that I tend to hyper focus on. So often all that's preached is not saying ANYTHING about a loved one's body in recovery but, for me, I then end up thinking that no one is saying anything because my body truly is disgusting. It's not all the time (because then I'd feel like it was trite) but when it happens, I have a moment of ""oh, ok, maybe my body isn't as horrible as I think it is."" For example, I've recently reached a point in my recovery where I'm allowed to exercise again and my husband and I have gotten really into rock climbing/bouldering--I generally feel weak and get down on myself for lack of muscle tone but a few days ago I was working on a route and my husband out of the blue just says to me ""holy shit babe, your back is looking really jacked, you're getting so strong!"" and I just about melted. It pulled me out of my ""my body is a gross useless piece of shit"" mindset and I found myself thinking ""oh, maybe I am doing something good for myself, I'm able to build muscle and get strong again."""

Over the past three years, my eating disorder has cost me the trust of my husband, huge amounts of time off from graduate school, $10K+ in treatment costs not covered by my shitty health insurance (because, as a 30 year old, I'm on my own for both insurance and supporting myself--I don't have family to fall back on), and possibly my fertility--menopause was temporarily induced because I was severely anemic due to lack of nutrition but I was still getting very heavy periods, after multiple blood transfusions to literally keep me alive, we did this. It's been a year and a half and I still don't get a regular period. In the past year alone, I have lost 4 close treatment friends due to medical complications related to their eating disorders--not suicide (I don't make this distinction to minimize those that lose their lives due to suicide). While yes, there are major health consequences that can strike those with eating disorders at any age, the older you get, the more finite those consequences become. It fucking sucks.   


We have been dealt a shitty hand but we have got to fight the fight and get what we can out of it.   


I've been working a lot with my team (and talking a lot about it with a close friend in a similar boat) lately to work on shifting the perception of recovery--that recovery looks different for everyone and that it doesn't have to be a bowl of sunshine and body positivity to be worthwhile. And working to accept that my ""full recovery"" might not mean being 100% weight restored and eating intuitively but learning to live with a meal plan that keeps me safe and healthy and mentally ok. I've still got a long way to go but I feel the brain parts slowly shifting. I'm trying to identify the things that are important to me that I know I need to fuel myself to be able to do."
