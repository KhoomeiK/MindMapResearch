I use hair masks every once in a while (the one I‚Äôm using now is from Shea Moisture and I LOVE it). I also put almond oil in my hair once a week and use a scalp massaging brush to evenly distribute the oil throughout my hair and to help get rid of the flakes in my scalp.

I made the mistake of trying to learn C# first. That was *rough* and a huge waste of like 2 months.

I started learning about a month ago but I just don't have the time I wish I had to focus on it because of school and work :/

I'm also the only one with super dry skin in my family (that's because of a birth complication though, not genetics.) and I haven't been able to find a good cleansing oil that works for my skin & I always end up going back to foaming cleansers which I think also dry my skin out too much in the long run.

I really didn't know *anything* about acids at the time and I didn't properly introduce it into my routine- I immediately started using it every night. My skin ended up breaking out and I eventually figured out it was the toner causing it, so I stopped using it.

A couple weeks ago, I decided *hey, I think I know more now after reading through this sub, let's try again!* and I literally only used it once a week for 3 weeks. I was never able to build it up because the right side of my face, as well as my nose, was *ruined*. Soooo many pimples that turned into hyperpigmentation spots. Again, I was able to pin it down to this toner. So now I'm currently just using products to help with hydration + products to help with the insane amount of hyperpigmentation I have now.

I've incorporated other acids before with no issues, so maybe this specific product just isn't meant for me :(

I did turn on 2FA for almost any accounts that use it so I gues now I just have to hope that I took care of everything, and act accordingly if I receive more security emails. Thanks!"

AskWomen,fbvzozx,t1_fbv2djp,1577138423.0,"Are you me by any chance lol

I‚Äôm also 20 and have never actually dated(hooked up once with a guy I met at a party but there were just so many things wrong with it. I regret it so much). Guys would always get super defensive and grossed out/laugh a lot whenever someone suggested going out with me when I was younger. I think I look a *bit* better now, but I only get super creepy old men asking me out on dates after a small conversation at a coffee shop or something.

I have friends and coworkers that always tell me I‚Äôm so pretty and ‚Äúthat guy was totally flirting with you/likes you‚Äù and I just can‚Äôt see it. It honesty makes me feel like they‚Äôre just lying to me to be nice since they know how ugly I really am.

It‚Äôs rough, but I‚Äôve sorta just learned to live with it and not really care. I immerse myself in work and hobbies and just being with friends and although I don‚Äôt care as much anymore, it sucks when all your friends are in relationships and you‚Äôre the only one alone."
