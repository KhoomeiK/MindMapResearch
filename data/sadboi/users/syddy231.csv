depression,etrhefj,t3_cd0hjp,1563121039.0,I relate so much. There were times last year when I thought I couldn't go on. I thought I would just collapse into tears and someone would help me. But I just kept going. Which was bad because I needed someone to help me. And until I collapsed into tears I would keep going on autopilot while dying inside. The functionality is what made me suffer so much more because I was so lonely and no one knew that I needed someone until I cried. But I couldn't cry either.
AskReddit,etrh9o6,t1_etrgarv,1563120953.0,I've just always wanted to know how to dance and think I would have more confidence in myself if I was able to do ballet :)
