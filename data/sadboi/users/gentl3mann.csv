ApplyingToCollege,f48jgsb,t1_f48dx5f,1571440503.0,Thank you for the good words! I didn’t think my GPA was that good but I do agree that my essays will have to be pretty well done. I’ve been looking for a counselor to help me with this but I haven’t decided on anyone yet and that kinda thing. I suppose it’s a case of changing my goals to more realistic ones and assess how it goes from there.
ADHD,f3967es,t1_f38k3qh,1570744160.0,this is without a doubt exactly how I think. I sometimes get lost in thought or think of something better while I’m talking about something because of just how much is going on at the same time

hiphopheads,eubam31,t1_eub9l7p,1563643563.0,"I’m suggesting not suddenly thinking Rocky’s sentence was justified and attacking trump for saying he’d try to free him - it’s pretty much impossible be apolitical about shit involving the president (especially THIS president), but my true point there was that politics has spread to every aspect of our society and its influence cannot be ignored."
hiphopheads,eub6ps9,t1_eub4p77,1563640955.0,This is correct. I don’t know why people are downvoting you for this. Governments may be our legal authority but they’re absolutely not the arbitrators of what’s morally right and wrong. I really don’t want this to turn into a politics circlejerk though I fear it already has
hiphopheads,eub6gxr,t1_eub5l6x,1563640793.0,"is this really what it’s come to? It’s the fuckin moral responsibility of everyone in society who’s “conscious” to oppose the current president? I’m no supporter of trump, but the SECOND he tweeted about freeing Rocky I thought, “How long is it going to take for people to suddenly want rocky to stay in jail because it’s Trump who’s trying to free him?” I now have the answer. Disliking Rocky for being grateful to the person who’s trying to get him out of prison is ridiculous and serves as a fine example of the inescapability of American politics in our culture."

TheExpanse,etx5jim,t1_etx50y2,1563291996.0,"I see...I was under the impression that it had some biological elements combined with nanotech of some sort. Still, I believe that it's more like virus-based than tech-based and might have some sort of biological analogs for tech we might expect it to have, e.g, biological computing abilities. Whatever the case, it's probably never going to be fully understood or fully explained, so this is the best we've got."
