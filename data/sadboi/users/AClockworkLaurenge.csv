dyspraxia,fpxukqx,t3_gg5bae,1588989879.0,"I've not been officially diagnosed (and now too old to be without it costing a bomb) but my dypraxia is partly why I don't want to drive. I've never really had the desire to drive anyway but the more I think about actually being behind the wheel, the more I just know it's not for me. There's just too much to focus on and I wouldn't want to put anyone's lives at risk because I got overwhelmed or mixed up or  forgot a step or whatever else I'm prone to doing.
I've been in (thankfully minor) car accidents a couple of times with friends and family who could drive and I've seen how shaken they've gotten, even if they've been driving for a while. 

However, from what I've researched previously, technically dyspraxia shouldn't stop you from being able to learn to drive and some dypraxic people can be excellent drivers, even if it requires a lot of focus/attention. It's a matter of preference and whether you think it's right for you (since it's you that will be behind that wheel, not your mom)."

depression,f0v8lyw,t3_d6qcoz,1568970035.0,"Because it does - but only if you let it. Winning the lottery and finding your true love could potentially solve all your problems, but only if you invested some of the money in seeing a therapist and seeking treatment as well as getting healthy emotional support from someone socially (like a good partner or just a decent friend).

But you don't need the absolute best in order to get better. As nice an idea it is to just wait around for something to 'fix' you come along, it's not going to magically happen. It's going to require some work from you. 
Sometimes it's all about taking the tiniest of baby steps in order to pick yourself up from your lowest. It's not going to be easy but it does get easier. But you have to keep trying, even when you don't want to.

I've been in similar places to you but I've had to train myself to look for things to keep me going and keep me making those little steps through life. Maybe it's that a gig in the next few months, maybe it's hanging out with friends next week. Maybe it's the idea of finally graduating from university, maybe it's just  getting to eat those snacks I like. 

Things only get better if you try to. So go see your doctor, go research local counseling or buy a book on CBT (and go actually read it), go listen to that song you like. But you gotta put one foot in front of the other (literally or figuratively) and go from there."
depression,f0v7voi,t3_d6qkk3,1568968754.0,"Depression doesn't discriminate based on how great someone's life is. A counselor might try to urge you to focus on the more positive aspects of your life but they shouldn't outright disregard the fact you're struggling with your mental health. If they do, then I'd say go and see a more competent one.

Ideally the aim of counselling is to help give you the toolset you need to recognise when you're not doing so good in a situation and how you can improve that. You might feel like you already know what you should do but a professional should at least help you put the theory into practice."
depression,f0v7l91,t3_d6q1w9,1568968255.0,"It's important to remember that not everyone understands mental health struggles and that isn't their fault. For some people, it can be that black and white (even though that's a far from ideal way of thinking). But instantly disregarding it as something you absolutely 100% cannot do is oversimplifying the situation too.

Hell, even among those who deal with depression themselves, no two conditions are exactly identical. For me, I have moments where yeah, I do actually need to force myself to be social (even something as minor as replying to a message or going food shopping) and it has helped me feel better or at least more human. Not always (I mean, sometimes even the idea of my flatmate looking at me can be a nightmare) and it isn't easy - but it can help.

The way I've tried to look at it when people say stuff like that is to see the fact they at least want to try and help me (even if it's not helpful advice for me personally) and that they apparently think I could help myself without struggling because I'm just that badass. It might be total bollocks but it can at least stop me from getting too irritated. That kind of rage doesn't really help anybody, especially me."
depression,f0v6yzf,t3_d6qyqr,1568967173.0,"It's a tricky situation. Sometimes I have days where I just don't want anyone to be aware of my existence and I know not everyone in my life understands that. I've had thankfully ex-friends with very damaging views on mental health that made me feel more of a burden for 'not being a proper friend's.

However, I've also had friends that - while being very supportive of me - have essentially refused to let me isolate myself too much either. And honestly sometimes it can be really helpful, as daunting as it is to force yourself to be social. Even if you feel like you're just going to drag people down, good friends are usually just happy to be around you. ('Hanging out' doesn't need to be a major event.) 
While I can't speak for him, this might be his way of feeling like he is being supportive by insisting you make time for each other. But if this is a big issue for you, you need to talk to him about it and explain your feelings so you can work together on finding the right balance for both your needs."
depression,f0v6df2,t3_d6mn57,1568966157.0,"I've been on both sides of this situation before. I understand how easy it is to blame yourself or even take it out on yourself when you're feeling this adrift. But remember that you're not defined by other people nor is anybody solely responsible for making you happy. This is not your fault.

However, I wouldn't say this is her fault either and while it's tough for you, it is also most likely a difficult decision on her end too. Sometimes it can require a lot of strength/energy/time to help someone who isn't in a good place and sometimes some people just don't have enough to spare (especially after a point of being the sole source of helping someone). If she feels this relationship is no longer healthy, you do need to respect that even if you don't strictly agree.

But what I would urge you to do is work on yourself so you can build more healthier relationships and find more sources of motivation to create a solid support network for yourself. I know that's not nearly as simple as it sounds but even researching ways of recognising your behaviours and healthy emotional outlets can be cathartic in itself"

I understand wanting to expand into other ventures but when you consider their 'range' of content already currently includes machinima, animation, podcasts, let's plays (recorded and streams), live action comedies and dramas, game shows, reality TV, actual feature films - and that's not including all the various live events, merch, books, etc. They already have their fingers in a lot of pies but they don't seem to realise their hands might be getting too full.

I'm currently writing my dissertation on RT and how they've managed to survive so long on the internet - yet with with how things have gone lately, I'm actually worried the conclusion I have to draw in a few months isn't going to be quite as positive as it was this time last year (which is a little disheartening)."

Games like Cuphead (with its 1930s cartoon aesthetic) or Kingdom Hearts (Disney side characters) can be entertaining enough for a child to watch as dad plays (which, speaking as a youngest sibling, I found being allowed to watch just as entertaining as actually playing).

Obviously this is just an idea to at least bridge the gap between gaming and family time, depending on his temper and finances among other things.

You mentioned before your 3y/o is essentially scared of him and worries about getting shouted at when she talks to him. That should ring alarm bells for you both. No child should have to fear a parent, especially at such a young age. There's nothing wrong with having a hobby for a bit of fun but he's using it as pure escapism from family life/parenting to such an extreme that it's impacting all of you negatively (including financially) to the point where it almost sounds like an addiction.

Your kids are only kids once. Gaming with the 3 y/o could even be a nice way for them to bond and spent time together since there's some good family-friendly games out there. But he needs to realise that he's a father & husband and no longer a teenage boy with no responsibilities, because that's all he's acting like right now."
AmItheAsshole,ezc077o,t3_d0qiz2,1567827903.0,"YTA. I don't wish to horrify you but a 1 year old baby often quite likes to be around their parents, especially at night. Part of why ""that part of the world in his brain"" now exists is because his brain is still growing and developing so he's probably just getting a better memory and now knows where to find his mum. Given his age, he's likely going through a period of separation anxiety which could be why he wants to sleep beside her.

When you have kids - or indeed choose to be a stepparent to someone else's kids - you do need to accept that parenthood can be smellier, louder and less private than you'd like it to be. It sucks but it's true. You mentioned already having a daughter so this shouldn't be news - but if it is and you can't handle that then maybe you need to rethink what kind of relationship you were expecting.

Also, sounding a classic parent, put your toys away! Preferably somewhere like a drawer or a storage box, you can even get special bags for them. Not only will it make it easier to keep them together and keep them clean, but kids can and will touch absolutely anything (even/especially if they're not allowed).

I don't know what they think being a grandparent is but it's not just a title to slap in a Facebook caption nor is it a right. Being a grandparent is both a privilege and a responsibility to do your best to help keep that kid happy and healthy.

AmItheAsshole,ezbsuav,t3_d06gss,1567824935.0,"NAH. It's a difficult situation for the family and it sounds like you all need to actually discuss your feelings and reasoning with each other. Secrecy and lying has been the root cause of this issue - now is the time to be honest with each other.

In regards to the wedding, I'd say it is ultimately your choice and maybe it is a good idea to wait further down the line to decide. However, my family had a kind of similar experience where my dad had a child from a previous relationship as well as me and my sister. When my parents got married when I was a kid, my mum only wanted us two to be bridesmaids, not my oldest sister (because she 'felt it'd be awkward to explain'/has never really been comfortable with my sister). My parents have been divorced for at least 15 years now yet my dad told me literally last week how much he regrets not putting up a fight to include her because, as he put it to me, ""I have three daughters and I love them all"". 

I know it's your wedding and not you dad's but I'd say the point still stands. If you feel like Nicky is your brother, then he is. Ultimately he's still a person and your mum needs to see him as one and not just some hypothetical 'reminder' or your dad's past infidelity. Amd who knows? Maybe if she actually spends time with him, she might actually like him."
depression,ez5sohj,t3_d012wq,1567704389.0,"I understand that. I've always been 'the outsider' at school, at work, in friend groups, even my own family. I'm 22 and at university now and while I've finally gravitated to some good groups of people, I'm also aware that I'm not really that important in any of them.
Sometimes it's outwith my control but I do also know I'm bad for unintentionally pushing people away when I'm avoiding being social and being generally unreliable because of anxiety. If you don't put an effort in, as difficult as it can be, it makes it easy for other people to believe their efforts aren't worth it either."
depression,ez5r8lf,t3_d01jay,1567703521.0,"Speaking as someone who struggles with mental health and also has friends who do, I've been in both positions here. When people say you should seek professional help, it doesn't mean they don't care about you and in fact often means the opposite - it means they know they can't give you the tools you need to help yourself but they know someone more qualified *can* help you.

I'll admit, I'm bad for not wanting to burden anyone with my existence but I've also lived with a close friend with depression, who was basically used by long distance friends as a free therapist while refusing to believe they needed help from a genuine professional.  He used to stay up until all hours on the phone with them and barely slept because he didn't want to risk them harming themselves if they couldn't talk to him. The fact it was making his depression worse didn't seem to matter to anyone except me and I constantly had to remind them he was not responsible for their actions.

Now while those 'friends' were kind of extreme, it is important to remember friendships need to have a balance in order to survive. You cannot solely emotionally support your friends and ignore yourself nor can you only emotionally dump on them and expect it not to take the same toll it takes on you. 
Your friends are not actively rejecting you when you open up and they believe in you being able to feel better. That's a sign to me that they do care."
