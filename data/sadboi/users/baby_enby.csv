ageregression,fm1mj58,t3_fse87q,1585681125.0,is this a punky brewster coloring book? o: so jealous
BPD,f5mjtw6,t3_do35b9,1572290652.0,"yes! not necessarily with the drama, but i definitely get that switch of like ""okay well you feel like you're going to explode now for no apparent reason. here's some self destructive urges. go do drugs or something."" one of the most frustrating feelings i deal with."
BPD,f5mjik4,t3_do3pkd,1572290534.0,"i definitely did this a lot during my middle school and high school years, but i never really understood why i couldn't stop. but this definitely makes sense of the situation."
BPD,f5mj27n,t1_f5kskbg,1572290396.0,"i definitely agree with this. the more time you spend alone, the easier it becomes to deal with. if i'm going to be alone, i kind of have to get comfortable with the idea of it before i can actually let myself enjoy it at all. i start off feeling uncared for and rejected but with time i end up excited to just chill and not have to be ""on"" for anyone. maybe give yourself things to look forward to like previous commenter does. beforehand, pick out a movie to watch with some popcorn and cozy pajamas. get yourself little things you can interact with that make you feel happy (face masks, bath bombs, video games, plan to watch live streams like twitch, etc) also i don't know if your current living situation would allow it, but getting a pet might also be extremely helpful. having a furry friend to greet you and love you when you get home might make going there and resting more bearable. i hope you find relief soon."
BPD,f5mf3px,t3_do72lt,1572289366.0,"yes, all the time. i talked to a friend about something similar to this, and he said ""usually if you suspect something is a symptom, it is a symptom."" kind of makes me feel like my entire personality and being is just one big symptom. i've never experienced having a ""mentally healthy"" brain, so i genuinely can't tell most of the time."
BPD,f5mc427,t3_dobkpv,1572288563.0,"i've read that engaging your other senses to focus on can really help with this, but i haven't tried it myself in practice. taking a few moments to have a snack and focus on the texture and taste. surrounding yourself with things that have good textures and letting yourself feel and notice them for a few moments. splashing cold water in your face. going and immediately watching a video you've found funny in the past. usually when i feel myself getting really angry i just shut down and stop talking, so i don't say anything i'll regret later. journaling also really helps me process and get it out, but i know that can be hard to sit down and make yourself do in the moment. hope you find relief soon. <3"
BPD,f5mawlx,t3_docgl8,1572288230.0,"i always get the urge to do this, but luckily my love for the people in my life usually overcomes the urge. but it's very frustrating feeling like you're constantly fighting with yourself, makes it difficult for me to know what i actually want."
BPD,f5ma6pz,t3_dochgn,1572288056.0,"this happens with my boyfriend pretty often. he's even promised he's ""awake for good"" sometimes and then immediately falls back asleep. it's frustrating and makes me feel like a child for getting upset about it. i think it just makes me feel uncared for, maybe? idk, but i try to be understanding and just ask that he let's me know if he's going to sleep if he can help it. i hope you feel better about it soon. and hopefully next time he'll be more considerate of your time. <3"
BPD,f5m8bsm,t3_docna2,1572287521.0,"you're incredibly resilient for continuing to do your best with all of this. it sounds like an awfully difficult situation, and i can't even imagine the amount of stress you must feel. i really hope things improve for you soon."
BPD,f4qpgwe,t3_dli4c9,1571756495.0,"god, yes. i think a big part of it is i feel like i love other people so much and feel so much for them, and i can just never feel that love returned."
BPD,f4ox3vn,t3_dl270x,1571710413.0,constantly. it's one of the things i daydream about really often. if only i were born rich and could start over whenever i wanted.
BorderlinePDisorder,f3vqt1r,t3_didf3n,1571182543.0,"marijuana definitely helps me a lot. whether it be from helping me be objective on a situation and changing my mindset or just setting my mind on a more positive path, it helps. i don't smoke daily. (i probably would if i could.) but i have tried so many different medications over the years, and none of them have ever worked as consistently as marijuana does. i find that people get on their high horses about marijuana and people becoming dependent and whatnot. but something that always makes me feel better when i see people shaming others for their use is the fact that if i were on any other medication, i would technically be dependent on it, too. and i would much rather be dependent on a plant than something feeding into big pharma and the drug industry. (no hate to people helped by prescription drugs. i just have had so many negative and disappointing experiences that i don't see myself ever trying them again.)"
BPD,f3t2rkd,t3_czwcod,1571116393.0,i didn't realize other people experienced this feeling. it's nice to know i'm not alone.
BPD,f3qvuke,t1_f3qvmxw,1571081627.0,"same to the needing time to process! at first i get really, really frustrated, but if i have a little bit to ""come to terms"" with the change then it's usually fine. so glad i'm not alone in this."
BPD,f3quinl,t1_f3q6igh,1571081006.0,"this is a really great reply. my therapist said something like ""we get to make a rule book for ourselves, a list of boundaries we won't allow ourselves or others in our lives to break"". it wasn't said in context to bpd, just in general when i brought up having a hard time knowing if i'm being rational or not. but i think it's really helpful. that way even if we FEEL like someone is bad or has hurt us, we can distinguish our feelings from the rational reality of the situation."

Anxiety,f3iih7r,t3_dgz0z7,1570937089.0,so so proud of you!! go you!!
Anxiety,f33tu7g,t3_dfjq2e,1570645003.0,"i have definitely experienced a great sense of relief after having a panic attack. like a feeling of a weight having been lifted and immediately being able to laugh and act like nothing happened. and have also experienced the feelings of detachment or dissociation (?) for the rest of the day after a panic attack. as far as the feeling of losing touch with reality during a bout of anxiety or a anxiety attack, i definitely understand that feeling. not sure if it can trigger actual psychosis, but i know my anxiety in general leads me to believe very deluded things. don't know how helpful this was, but you're not alone in these feelings!"
