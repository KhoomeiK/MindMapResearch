self,fgm00ib,t3_ez5vbn,1580915061.0,"What you described sounds to me like true clinical depression. I also have struggled with depression and several other disorders since my early teens, and they stick with me even now that I'm almost 30. 

'Clinical depression' is different than when someone says they're 'feeling depressed.' When my friends have felt depressed the last couple days. I realize it's not the same empty, hollowness that I experience, but they're experiencing a lower mood than normal. For them it might be the weather, a bad experience at work, another poor situation that caused it. My situation with depression is different from those. There isn't a traceable cause. I feel hollow, empty, void of any worth and undeserving of the love that people show me. I've talked to others who have depression and they experience it differently than I do. Rather than a void, they've described it as an oppressive cloud. My experience and the experience of others does not invalidate yours. Everyone's perspective and experience is unique and only you can judge what you feel. 

From what you described, and what I've experienced, what you're going through sounds very familiar depression. To extremely oversimplify things, clinical depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. And believe me when I say that that is a HUGE oversimplification because the human nervous system is incredibly complex and even smallest stimuli can make huge changes. If you look at the human nervous system in a broad overview, it's an chemical electrical system. The chemicals that the nerves use to communicate with each other across synapses are called neurotransmitters. One of the most common medical treatments for depression can be medications to help re-balance the neurotransmitters. That being said, depression can be caused by life events, like you mentioned, but it can also be caused by ~~simple~~ genetics. If that's the case, it can skip generations and can vary in severity. 

I'm sorry that you're going through this, but there are ways to treat depression. It takes time to find the right one because everyone's brain chemistry is different. I don't know much about you, but I do know this, you are brave. You were strong enough to reach out and ask others for advice about a topic that is extremely personal and could've left you open for scrutiny. I hope you find what works for you and you keep moving forward."
mentalhealth,f24qc3d,t3_dbw7qj,1569958004.0,"If there's one thing I can say for sure after reading your post, it's how impressed I am with the maturity, bravery, and above all the strength you have, even as a teenager!

You mentioned that it took you time to get courage to post on this subreddit. Reaching out for help or advice is often one of the hardest things to do, but you did it. And I can't tell you how strong that will make you.


Having ADD/ADHD combined with anxiety and depression is definitely a whopper to be handed in high school. High school is shitty enough with all the cliques and drama and hormones. Adding anxiety,ADHD, and depression to the list just adds more stress to the experience. These three are often linked together and progress along side each other. So the way your symptoms sort of lead into each other makes sense from a medical stand point. (I'm not a doctor, I'm merely speaking from my research into my own disorders.)

I'm glad you're seeing a therapist. I know how awkward it is to talk with MY parents about things that bothered me when I was a teenager. It was even worse if they were at all related to what was bothering me. But sharing our feelings with someone can help us find ways to cope with them or even find a way to stem the source of negative emotions. 

Being an artist would be a really fun job! The best way to get a job as an artist is to start now. Get a notebook, and just draw. You don't even your first , second, or last page of the notebook to be good. That's what the 2nd, 3rd, and 10th notebooks are for. ;) Being an artist is almost all about experience and knowledge. If you don't know how to draw faces, check out a few youtube videos. If you want to mix paints properly, there are tutorials for that too! The more art you have in your portfolio, the easier it will be to do what you want after high school. Whether you go straight into your career or an art school, having an established portfolio is huge!

 I want to leave you with one nugget of wisdom. In life some people make friends easily with everybody, and some choose to make friends with the best people. These groups aren't mutually exclusive. I guess what I'm talking about in the second group is choosing close friends who are the Best People. Those kind of people will be friends that might not know how to help you when you're hurt or crying but they will hold you and stay close until someone does. The Best kind of friends are those who don't worry if others are/aren't hanging around because they know that being friends with you is what's important! High school had 4 of my life's roughest years, but the friends I had helped me get through it.

I know this reply isn't much. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask!

 I want you to know that I'm cheering for you!"
mentalhealth,f1b6kvz,t3_d8kcns,1569325621.0,"Sorry things have been so rough for you. 

I do want you to know that out of everything you just mentioned, especially considering all the stress you're going through, everything points to you being an awesome person! 

After all, just look at all of the things you're doing despite your situation!

1. You're working in customer service, a job that a lot of people just half-ass and take their paycheck, but you put in the effort. So much effort that your superiors noticed and gave you a promotion!

2. You have feelings for one of your friends, but they aren't reciprocated. Some people would cut off the friendship after that, but you value that friendship enough to realize the value that it holds. That takes wisdom that most people lack at any age!

3. You care about your family so much that you dont want them to worry about you. I'm guessing someone like you has, at the very worst, a halfway decent family. Otherwise you wouldn't be worried about worrying them! I bet they care about you the same way you do about them.

4. You are stronger than you realize. Some people, myself included, bunker down and isolate themselves when they are dealing with large amounts of stress. You reached out! I can't even begin to tell you how powerful of a difference that is! 

Things may get worse before they get better, but remember, you don't have to do it alone. You've got this!"

Do you think it would be better to separate them? If so, should I reply to my own comment? Or just leave 2 separate comments?

mentalhealth,f19nmxr,t1_f19ilml,1569274882.0,"That was a much better informational answer than I could have given! I'm currently on a SSRI but I was first prescribed medication when I was 12, and it's been many a year since then. 

I do want to add something though, everybody's brain is different. Since each medication, and more importantly each class of antidepressant that you mentioned, interacts with your brain in a specific way it's possible that the first one you try won't be the right one for you.

Best of luck!

mentalhealth,f19bnal,t3_d7yp5k,1569270362.0,"The way you described your numbness is a lot like how I feel when my depression gets really severe. I don't really feel sad, just an overwhelming hollowness. It ends up being a relief if I am able to cry because at least it's something to feel. 

I'm glad you have family and friends who care about you. I know you didn't say they did, so this is an assumption on my part, but call it personal life experience that's allowing me to finally let me see the forest through the trees.

One of the reasons people get sad is when they see someone they love who is hurting. Even more so if they themselves didn't realize it. This isn't a failing of your family and friends, in fact it goes to show how much they care about you! 

When we see a friend in need, we want to help right away. When we find out a friend was in need and we fail to realize it, we wish we could have helped. Then we wonder, 'Why didn't I help?I'm they're friend! Why didn't I notice they needed help?' 
At this point we have 2 options: be an a-hole and blame our friend for not telling us, or blame ourselves for not recognizing a friend in need. Every one of us who is a true friend chooses the second.

This comment is long enough already, but if you don't mind I'd like to give my 2 cents on hiding your true emotions. Especially since you have family and friends who care about you.

I grew up with all sorts of mental health issues. I grew up watching them be sad when I struggled, so I decided to hide my true emotions in high school. I got damn good at it.

But each time things became too much for me to handle internally and my 'mask' shattered, I saw the happiness that had been on their faces turn to slip away and turn to despair as they learned of the thoughts I'd struggled with on my own for the past months. Things that could have been helped with treatment. At first I looked at it like a bandaid being ripped off, but later I realized it was more like stabbing a still healing wound. I've long since stopped using 'masks' but I'm not sure the wounds have yet healed. But at least now the people that I love are spending time with me instead of the 'mask' of serenity that I wanted them to see.

 I guess what I want to say is this. 

Be EXTREMELY careful about using a 'mask' to hide your pain or emotions from the people you love.

While putting on a 'mask' to hide your own pain might shield your pain from the people you care about, that shielding only lasts as long as the mask is in place. If you want to be honest and take off your mask, they will see your pain and feel hurt that you didn't trust them. If something that resembles the mask appears, they'll wonder if they can trust it. If the mask slips off because you weren't paying attention, or even shatters because you're own pain is too great to maintain it, this will cause them pain that lasts. The more times you put the mask back on, the more opportunities they have to get hurt.

Tldr; your family and friends care about you, hiding your true feelings may feel like a kindness but it's likely to hurt in the long run."
mentalhealth,f190v1f,t3_d886rg,1569266272.0,"Hey there, it sounds like you've really had it rough!

I went through a similar issue in college with my anxiety. It wasn't exactly how you described it, but having symptoms that made me miss class  made my anxiety worse when the next class came around. That meant my anxiety and my symptoms were worse which meant I missed class again. This repeated over and over.

One thing that you're doing, something that I lacked the strength and courage to do, was reach out for help. You shared what you're going through with us, and I hope you realize that this single action makes you far stronger than I was. 

A lot of schools have a counselor you can set up appointments with in order to talk to. I understand getting to classes is crazy stressful for you because you've missed them in the past. Since this counselor is separate you can talk to him, both about what your struggling with mentally and academically. They are usually trained to help with both kinds of issues and they might have some suggestions of what to do. 

Also, if all else fails, talk to your doctor. If they believe that it's necessary for you to take the rest of this semester off to get a handle on you're mental health, they can fill out documentation for a medical withdrawal or 'semester extension.' Most colleges only allow these a couple times, but they do give you leeway. Medical withdrawals are far better than dropping out since your tuition is (at least partially) refunded. Semester extensions are usually done for students with extenuating circumstances that cause absences such as illnesses. Mental health can certainly apply for such a thing.

Whatever happens, I'm pulling for you!"
mentalhealth,f18v8aa,t3_d8a0zn,1569263873.0,"Some older folks have a mindset that men should be tough and be able to handle any mental issue. This to me is a generational thing that has been passed on to certain people who are now in there 30s and younger. Some of those younger folks have learned empathy, whereas others stay like there parents.

There's a reason ""man up"" is one of the worst pieces of 'advice' I've ever received. 

It isn't advice. 

It is two unimaginative words from a mind that fails to comprehend your struggle or an unsympathetic heart that is unwilling to care. More often than not, it's both.

""Man up"" sometimes comes from those who see the struggles of others, struggles that they have never dealt with in their own lives, struggles they can't be bothered to understand. If they truly care about you, then this is only their first response because they don't know how to respond to your pain. As the weeks roll by, you'll see what kind of person they are. Hopefully they listen to you, and learn a better way to respond and help others.

Worse, ""Man up"" can come from someone who doesn't care. I've met these people, and they each fall into their own little basket. Some are jerks and others are far worse."
mentalhealth,f15vzu8,t3_d7xsdg,1569197295.0,"Don't give up! 
Even though right now a sense of hope feels really far away, cling to the things and people in your life that give it meaning. During my battles with depression, I have to write a note for myself that reminds me that I am my harshest critic. Others critique my actions, but my own mind can criticize my every thought. For those of us who struggle with depression, it can be such a feeling of isolation that I, personally, don't feel that anyone else could relate to such a worthless person like myself. But after I talk to people, I often find a more sympathetic tone than my mind would have had me believe. 

After you're done reading this comment, please hug your dog for me. I'm glad that because of your pet you had the strength to reach out. That is one powerful puppy! 
Next, talk to someone. If there's someone you trust, give them a call. I know phone calls are weird in 2019, but it will help to talk. If everyone else is busy right now, or you're worried about bothering them, call 1-800-273-8255. They have trained staff you can talk to to give you ideas of what to do next.

lonely,eyynibu,t3_czg7pw,1567595769.0,"I can somewhat relate to your feelings of enjoying solitude. I can definitely understand your fears about these feelings becoming permanent. When I was your age, I was as introverted as I am now, but I was trying to fake it till I could make it. 

It was exhausting.

I can't say whether that technique was successful. What I can tell you was that I made friends, usually not with the person who I was faking it to, but with someone they introduced me to.

Since I don't know you, I can't say this is a good choice for you. But I can say that reaching out for advice is a heck a lot wiser than I was at your age. 

I'm in your corner if there's any advice I can offer, and I wish you the best!"

If your first session isn't what you want from the therapist for whatever reason. keep the second appointment. Discuss the sissues with them and ask for recommendations for who they feel might better fit better with you.."
