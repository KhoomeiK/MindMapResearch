AskAnAmerican,fk8y8c7,t1_fk6yt6q,1583965101.0,"0 to 10 is 10. *To* means at the point of i.e., exactly 10 - not *""including""* 10. If you were born January 1 then you would be 1 year old *after* 12 months; you would be 1 year old on January 1. Saying that does not imply that you are 1 year *at the end of* January 1. Everyone knows that this means from the instantaneous moment of your birth until the instantaneous moment of your birth + 1 year. In the same way, 10 years *after* 1990 is 2000. 1990-2000 is 10 years. *On* December 31st 1999 it has not been 10 years. Only *after* - and the first exact moment *after* that is January 1st 2000. 1990 - 2000 is 10; 0 - 10 is 10. 

In mathematics 0.0000... to 1.0000... are exactly 1 apart. January 1 1990, 00:00:00.0000...  to January 1 1991 00:00:00.0000... is 1 year. Do this ten times and you arrive at January 1 2000 00:00:00.0000... - in other words, 1990 - 2000 is ten years; ten years is 1 decade. 1990-2000 is one decade. 

We count years as integers. Integers have a value of *exactly* x.000... Now, consider the following integers ranges:

1: 0-1

2: 1-2

3: 2-3

4: 3-4

5: 4-5

6: 5-6

7: 6-7

8: 7-8

9: 8-9

10: 9-10

How mystifying this must be for you that there are 10 items in that list of 0-10. 

Even if we were to expand them to decimals 0.000... - 1.000... is 1; If you were to argue that it should actually be 0.999... then I've got bad news because  0.999... is the same as 1.000... because there is no ""number"" exists between those number, there is no last 9. Consider 1/3: 0.333... Three of those is 3/3, which is 1.000... and 3 * 0.333... is 0.999... thus 0.999... is equal to 1.000... So 0.000... - 10.000... is exactly 10. When counting - when using integers - the space between the numbers is exactly 1. If you start with 0 and add 1 you arrive at 1; 0 to 1 is 1. If you start with 0 and add 10 you arrive at 10. You started at 0 and arrived at 10. 0 to 10 is 10. If you start at 1990 add 1 year you arrive at 1991. If you start at 1990 and add 10 years you arrive at 2000. 1990-2000 is 10 years, a decade. 

Imagine there are 3 apples on the table and your kindergarten teachers says ""count the apples on the table"" - you say ""one, two, three."" Now imagine there is a rope with knots in it that are 1 foot apart that looks like this: ._._._. we start at the beginning of the rope, the length is zero. Move to the next knot - now we're at 1, then 2, then 3. We're at the last knot so we stop. The rope is 3 feet long. knots 0-3 is 3 feet long. 0-10 would be 10 feet long. Years are a span of time; decades are a span of time; they are like the rope, not the apples. Imagine the knots are year demarcations and _ is 1 year long. (1990)_(1991)_(1992)_(1993) - in order for 3 years to elapse you count from knot 1990 to 1993. In writing that is 1990-1993, in speech that is ""1990 to 1993.""  

If class starts at 12:00 and is 1 hour long what time do you leave? The answer is 1:00. 12:00-1:00 is 1 hour. If something starts at 12:00 pm and it's 10 hours long you leave at 10:00 pm. 12:00 pm - 10:00 pm is 10 hours. Shift that 12 hours; 12:00 am - 10:00 am is 10 hours. In 24 hour time that's 00:00 - 10:00 is ten hours. 0 - 10 is 10.  

You seem to be rather ignorant of the nuances of language. The use of the word *in* implies it is something that has space (even if that space is meta-physical.) *In* 1990 means ""the span of time we call 1990"" i.e., ""January 1 1990 00:00:00.000... to January 1 2000 00:00:00.000..."" If we wanted to imply *exactly* 1990 we would say *at* not *in* - though we generally use language like that for years. When we say *to* we mean ""Up until"" but when we want to include the last item we say ""through."" In writing, we understand that in 0-10 the '-' means *to* not *through.*

To complicate things, it is actually not always true; it's very inconsistent. For example when talking about calendar days something like ""You can be here for 1 month"" and it's May 1st, something like ""I have the place from May 1st to May 31st"" would generally be interpreted as including May 31st. But ""You have the place until June 1st"" does not include June 1st. Likewise, May 1st *to* June 1st generally would not include June 1st because if we meant it to we would say May 1st *through* June 1st; but we don't always do that because language is fuzzy, so we rely on context; we understand that range is ""the month of May"" and thus does not include June 1st; we rely on the *way language is used* because if we don't we are unable to communicate properly. So if we're talking about decades, ""when was the 20s"" is sometimes answered as 1920 - 1929; it implies *through* - it's a pragmatic implication because counting decades like that does so successively and it avoids having a year in there twice. If we were counting single years ""when was 1937"" would be ""1937-1938."" Really, what it comes down to is that when we say ""the 20s is from 1920 - 1930"" we know we are talking about a decade, thus it *must* mean Jan 1 1920 through Dec 31 1929; we infer this in the same way we infer the 19xx (incidentally, there's a bit of conflict now because the 20s refers to both the 1920s and the 2020s; generally we will understand which depending on the context - if you're discussing history you likely mean the 1920s, if you are discussing contemporary culture you are likely referring to the 2020s.) So when we render ""the 14th century"" as ""1301-1400"" we understand that that includes 1400 because it must for it to be a span of 100 years. 

In our society absolutely no one counts decades as ""1st, 2nd 3rd"" (as we do for centuries,) they count them by the group they belong to ""the [19]10s, [19]20s, [19]30s"" - which is to say ""the years that start with [19]1x, the years that start with [19]2x, the years that start with [19]3x"" (this is simply a fact about how these terms are used.) The language to count them like you think we do (which you are incorrect about) would be ""the 192nd decade"" as we do with ""the 20th century."" We do not do that. In other words, it is irrelevant that there is no year 0 because we simply don't count decades in a way where that affects anything. We could have started the calendar on April 17th 1483 and ""the 1920s"" would still be 1920 *through* 1929; or 1920-1930.

If you are consistently communicating unsuccessfully you are wrong, not the rest of society."

At that length you don't need inch-level precision. Just like you wouldn't need to know how many extra centimeters there are after 21 meters.

Your sales tax analogy is deeply flawed; that's a much lower percent and it's used to improve society, often on things that are voted for, and it's factored directly into the final price. The sliding scale has led to social pressure to move the ""you're not an asshole"" threshold up and up. Anyway, my state doesn't even have sales tax so maybe I'm missing something in your analogy. 

You're acting like talking about the ""facts of reality"" is being pragmatic. What you're saying makes total sense only if you look at it without the context of the rest of society. The only people who are a fan of tipping culture are servers and people who employ servers in those places with backwards labor laws. They tolerate it because of the implications from social pressure."

AmItheAsshole,fj1vysw,t1_fiz3qy1,1582929015.0,"I live in a state that doesn't have crappy labor laws - I don't need to vote for people to change it. And yet we still have this parasitic system of tipping that servers have the audacity to feel entitled to. Minimum wage is not, never was, and should not be for ""living on."" 2/3 of states have a minimum wage higher than federal already.

I get that that viewpoint makes me an asshole to some people but the reality is that most tipped workers in the US make much more than minimum wage and a hell of a lot of them act incredibly entitled about it. With any other job if you don't like the way it operates or if they are doing something illegal or whatever it may be you don't tell the patrons to feel bad for you and give you money. You deal with it or leave. Begging isn't the solution to this problem, it only encourages it to continue."
AmItheAsshole,fj1uzzk,t1_fiz42wy,1582928384.0,"There are 13 states that have a minimum cash wage above the federal minimum. Still not quite a third (which is 16) fine, but I was making a generalization from memory. This is also ignoring the fact that 31 states have a minimum wage (usually much) higher than the federal minimum.

It's still disingenuous to say that servers make $2.13/hr - especially when you're saying it to get sympathy and justify the expectation that patrons therefore should pay you more. 

It doesn't cost money to report a violation, and you can't be legally fired for reporting. If the employee has a problem with their job they can quit, just like anyone in any other job. Making people feel bad for not supplementing their income isn't ethical even putting aside all the problems with tipping etiquette. Especially since most servers make much more than other minimum wage jobs."
AmItheAsshole,fiyz5gz,t1_fiylquv,1582850335.0,Minimum wage for servers is still the federal minimum wage. People don't understand how that system works. Most states use a better modified system and about a third require minimum wage before factoring tips.

AskAnAmerican,fh3uswe,t1_fh2k0h1,1581272445.0,"I hate people that criticize how ""arbitrary"" inches/feet/miles is. The fact is that we very *very* rarely mix them - basically never outside of a persons height. Measuring out for a project? inches - even if is 96 of 'em. Measuring short distances? Feet. Measuring medium distances, say under a third of a mile? Yards. Long distances? Yep, miles. No one says 1 mi 1000' - it'd just be 1.2 miles. It's not like we don't understand decimals just because our system isn't based around them. 

The brain would remember the impression of a kilometer exactly the same way as the impression of a mile - ""big distance."" Like... when in the real world do you ever need to convert between the two? I makes no difference if it's base 10. You pick the one that closes matches the precision you need, then use fractions, either decimal or the wonderfully divisible dozenal. 

People praise metric for things like 1ml = 1 sq cm = 1 oz; but, as you said, it's not like we're working only with water at standard temperature and pressure. It's totally useless in every day life. The industries that need it use metric. 

We don't have dozens of countries within a day's travel, so there is no inconvenience to our lives - thus no pressure to our government to change it (though it has been attempted in the past) and it would be expensive and take at least 2 generations to switch over. Globalization will increase and it will happen naturally, I'd wager. 

Imperial (or Us CuStOmArY uNiTs) is better for every day life - which is unsurprising since it came from and to facilitate every day life. 

If the US had the privilege of designing a system from the ground up due to pressure from nearby countries needing to be able to work together in day to day life we'd almost certainly have made a metric system, too."
