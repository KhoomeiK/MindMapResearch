I could always kill myself later.

Since that night, I’ve gone through so many friends, so many love interests, and it’s always been an emotional roller coaster where I almost did kill myself later. 

But here’s where it’s uplifting. All those problems were life lessons teaching me what I need to know in order to see what is truly important.  Now, I’m living my best life, and I couldn’t be happier. I see those tough times as education.  I’m grateful for all of it because it made me into the person I am today which knows how to be happy.
