puppy101,flhrgyr,t1_flftbmu,1585168122.0,I spoke to him about it. But he agreed that he'd take 70% care of him as long as we're in lockdown. And we can also get his mum to dog sit if we wanted to go out. And soo far he's sticking by his work. He stays in the room with the puppy all day and moved his work table to that room. I play with the puppy and train him and take him for potty breaks and stuff. But staying with the puppy all day he does. So I've started to feel better now. I don't think we can take him back now since my boyfriend is extremely attached and it would break him. So as long as he stays with him until he can stay alone I think everything will be fine. üòå
puppy101,fldmplm,t1_fld2j5y,1585067614.0,"Ikr? I thought that getting a puppy will change my mind about kids. But it did the opposite. I absolutely do not want kids now. üòÖ Idk why we as women are taught to feel guilty if we don't want kids. My parents also want grandkids soo bad. They say things like, ""the only reason we live on is to see your kids"". It's soo hard. üôÑ"
puppy101,flcuber,t1_flctt53,1585046887.0,I relate to this soo much. The whole situation about the cat is making it even more stressful.
puppy101,flcu9pb,t1_fl9w12q,1585046829.0,I never thought of it this way. When I did I realize I'm not ready. I truly am not. I want to be free again. I will talk to my partner. He is home now because of Corona and has relived me of alot of puppy duty. But it's still not better. The mere thought that there's a puppy home overwhelms me. I feel like going away but I cannot because of Corona. I think I need to have a conversation about this with my partner. Thank you.
puppy101,fl7xsmj,t1_fl7x7jf,1584911659.0,"I don't think I can give him back either. That'll probably make it much worse than it is now. 

Yeah you're right. I never really wanted kids but I never thought much of it and thought it's maybe an age thing. But now I'm convinced that I don't want any kids. But my partner really wants kids and I'm sure he'll be the best father ever. And my parents will be heartbroken too. That's probably adding to it. Now that I put it down in words here I'm starting to understand this much better. Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è"
puppy101,fl7xfv5,t1_fl7wzmh,1584911442.0,That really gives me hope. I love him too. Sometimes I just hold him and cry because I love him soo much and he's soo cute but I regret getting him. It's such a rollercoaster.
SuicideWatch,fl7x6mf,t3_f9d5go,1584911287.0,"I have the best parents in the world, the best partner I could get and a very decent life and still feel the exact same way. I feel like I don't deserve any of that. And what even worse is that I feel guilty about feeling this way because I know people who have it much worse are still going on and about. Lol."
puppy101,fl7vdf7,t1_fl7v7pu,1584910188.0,Thank you. I really hope I feel the same way at some point too. üòå
puppy101,fl7v3ho,t1_fl7ub22,1584910020.0,Yeah it's probably much harder for him than it is for me and that makes me sad too. I don't want to jump to conclusions. I will wait for a few more weeks and hope it will get better. Otherwise I just have to accept that it's going to be this way since my partner is already very attached to him and would never want to give him back.
puppy101,fl7ue7n,t1_fl7ts5u,1584909587.0,He cries only if no one is in the room. He's a very good boy as long as he knows that people are always there. And he doesn't give us much problem in the night. He sleeps in his crate and since it's his first weeks we sleep on a mattress in the same room. Whenever he wakes up to pee on his puppy toilet he whines a bit and if we tell him we're here and go to bed he does that with no issues. Overall he's a really good boy. That's what's making this worse for me. I feel all this even though he doesn't stress me out. My partner cared for him on the weekend and I only had to play with him or train him a bit. And I had plenty of time to myself. But still I cry. For every small thing. That makes me feel even more guilty. I don't know why I feel this way. My partner thinks it's 100% puppy blues and that it will go away in time. But I don't know. I think it maybe something more.
puppy101,fl7tpgw,t1_fl7tgit,1584909167.0,Does it get better? I'm really considering taking him back. The problem is that I cry for everything even if not puppy now which is not normal for me. I feel like getting him is triggering my depression. I feel like I'm a horrible person for feeling this way.
relationship_advice,ewm18tr,t1_ewlzzdg,1565540822.0,"Yes yes, he does make me very happy. And I see myself having a life with him. But I just want him to stand up for himself, even to me. 

I was soo confused until now. But I realized that when it's just the both of us there's nothing I would change. I'm very happy and content when I'm alone with him. The problem is just when we're around other people or when we go out in public. I think I will give it a few months time and wait and see if therapy changes anything. I want to give this a chance. 

It was soo wonderful talking to you. I literally had no one to talk to about this and Reddit was my last resort. Thank you soo much!  I have much more mental clarity rn."
relationship_advice,ewlz87g,t1_ewly3n4,1565539478.0,"Yes, I agree with everything you say here. 

But he has done soo much for me and always tries his best to keep me happy. :( As a boyfriend he's the best. But as a person in general he needs a lot of work.

And he's only this way towards himself. He stands up against everything that is wrong otherwise. For eg, the other day we witnessed a young boy trying to molest a small child and he didn't think twice. He ran up there and confronted the boy and made sure to put an end to it. He even went as far as to inform the boys mum about it. I was really surprised by this.

But when it comes to himself, nothing!! He thinks he's small. He literally exuberates inconfidence. One look at him and people get to know that he's easy to bully. He thinks he doesn't deserve to be in the world. When he takes public transport he makes sure to occupy the least space and contract himself into a small unnoticeable ball. This is when I realized that there's a real problem and that it's just not normal shyness. I'm failing miserably to make him understand that he's important and he's wonderful and he deserves to be here and be happy. If only he could see what I see.

I don't know how fair it is to leave someone based on something that is out of their control. Especially when they're ready to make changes. I feel like leaving now will be counterproductive and will push him into a darker place."
relationship_advice,ewlxi3j,t1_ewlwo3e,1565538335.0,"I already spoke to him about the social anxiety part and he agrees that he needs therapy. We're looking into that now.

I don't want to leave him because I feel like it will break him in all kinds of ways. I'm his first girlfriend and he's madly in love with me. But at this point I don't know if I'm staying in the relationship because I love him or because I feel bad for him and if he's with me not only because he loves me but also because he's afraid to be alone again. I came to this conclusion because few times I've been unreasonable in the relationship and he never stood up for himself. He just tolerated everything. As soon as I realized that things were clearly my fault it messed with my head. What if he never stands up to me and suffers in silence throughout the relationship. Ugh!!

 Everytime I talk about leaving because of our differences he says he's ready to make all kinds of changes(reasonable) in order to make it work. I want to give him a chance but it's screwing with my mental peace. I'm so confused at this point."
