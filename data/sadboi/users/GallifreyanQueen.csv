shittypetkeeping,fkaf4p6,t1_fkacf1v,1584005197.0,i also work at a petco and my managers are pretty divided on the issue. my animal care manager regularly sells hamsters (any) to people who get the critter trail starter kits and shrugs when i tell him differently. another feels for the animals and will try to dissuade customers from buying certain animals/setups and will occasionally refuse the sale of a small animal or fish. i haven’t gotten in any disciplinary trouble for refusing sales however it does seem to be frowned upon. money and moving product is more important than proper animal keeping it seems.
changemyview,fk539wt,t1_fk52cd0,1583872634.0,"!delta Thank you so much for your lengthy reply, I loved seeing all the statistics. This changes my view in that companies like fast food restaurants and groceries (those who are doing the huge ordering of meat and animal products) are showing a ton of interest in plant based options for their customers. Yes, if more individuals became vegan then eventually the meat industry would become less horrible. But individuals are not the problem here, it is the huge corporations such as McDonalds or Taco Bell that are influencing our decisions on meat eating. Maybe next time I go out to eat i’ll have a salad. And thank you everyone else commenting for your replies as well, this has been an interesting discussion. I just hope to one day see the end of horrible conditions on factory farms, to see legislation and enforcement of the ethical treatment of animals, and that we can have an ethically better meat product if we are to indulge."
changemyview,fk52g01,t1_fk516h8,1583872180.0,"I’m not saying it would cause someone else to eat more meat, i’m saying people eat more meat on their own. I don’t believe that the demand for meat is going to go down with an increased amount of vegans, up until a certain threshold of course. I’d say the threshold for meat and animal product companies to start producing less meat/animal products would be around 50 million vegans."
changemyview,fk525x0,t1_fk5150q,1583872028.0,"If more people do not eat meat, others will make up for it by eating more meat. In addition, people immigrate to the US every day and take up our lifestyle of meat-eating, so the breeders continue to breed as many animals as possible for maximum profit."
changemyview,fk51z4y,t1_fk50ivo,1583871925.0,"Funny that you bring up the term “free range”, as the FDA website states that the term free range as it applies to chickens is that they have “open air and room to roam”, meaning that all a farmer has to do is open the door to the barn. The chickens can’t move anyway because they cannot get up and walk. The term “free range” has no legal definition in terms of beef. So the industry has noticed that people are wanting healthier alternatives or some way to feel better about killing animals so they throw in these terms that elicit a feeling of health and well-being for these animals when it is not in fact true. Yes, over time small changes will add up but we can’t keep pretending that our healthy choices are healthy."
changemyview,fk4y39g,t1_fk4wdwk,1583869821.0,"See I don’t believe that 1% less animals would be killed if 1% of people are vegan. Some people love their meat, and make up for the 1% that isn’t eating meat. Like yes a hundred thousand people might not touch meat, but 200 million at least are eating meat products a few times a day. My point here is that people being vegan is not decreasing the demand for the product."
changemyview,fk4x2jj,t1_fk4w916,1583869264.0,"I personally don’t believe that if one person stops eating meat that it “saves” the animals in these farms. Like you mentioned how you’ve “saved” a few cows and chickens, I don’t believe that they were not killed like the thousands before them just because one dude isn’t eating them. There is always someone to take your place. And yes, like a lot of you are saying every bit counts. But until those bits form a mass that is larger than the industry itself nothing will change. Another commenter said that we have to vote on these things, which I completely agree with. We have to tackle this problem with legislation, not the act of not buying meat products."
