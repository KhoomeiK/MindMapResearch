Bad writing aside, they stray away from the usual choices LI tropes of forced perfect male LI with the most diamond scenes, secondary broody male LI that is secretly a softie or has a funny side, perfect female LI whose attractiveness is something both writers and fans keep informing us of, and the other secondary cool female LI with quirks.

I chose both Thomas Hunt and Slater Dominguez for RCD and AME, respectively. Hunt may still fall under the grumpy and brooding secondary LI trope (in the same tier as Ramsey), but Slater was different. I can understand why so many of his fans got annoyed with how wasted he was in the second half of AME All Stars."
