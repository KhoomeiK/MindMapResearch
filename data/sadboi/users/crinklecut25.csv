It was awkward and horrible to be heading out the door on fridays and have to ask the Dad, “oh, can I have my check?” Or some lame way of asking.  It’s very inconsiderate and rude.  They consistently forgot my money too.  This was before Venmo and direct pay.  Sorry you are going through this. It sucks but maybe ask him a few hours before you leave then again when you leave and say you really need it that night or something.  Boo to them!"

Yes, cheating is wrong and perhaps your son realizes this.  But to jump to Maggie’s side over your  own son?  That’s silly.    Be happy for him!  He might marry this new girl someday!

I Know I have a job but it’s a nanny job and very difficult.  The parents are goons.  I almost quit today then realized this might get worse with Covid and it will be impossible to get another job.  But I’m miserable.  And I’m sorry you are so miserable too.  Unemployment $ and stimulus $ will come just not as fast as you need it. Most of us are eating too much or just vegetating so you’re not alone.  I wish I could be quarantined instead of worrying about getting the virus from the goons I work for.  Don’t worry about not saying hi to that girl.  You’ll get the chance again when you’re ready.  Just try to get through all this if you can.   You are going to be fine.😀

I get no recognition, no gestures or thankyou for stepping up for the children in a new and different world. No one asks how I am, compliments me, or gives me a raise or even a small gift to show appreciation. Not to mention one of their children is a challenge each and every day.  But how can we get another job now in this pandemic?
Yes, grateful for the job.  Just feel incredibly unappreciated.  And not valued.  So I give you lots of understanding nanny hugs and stay strong.  Easier days are coming."

I think of him everyday, and 9 months after his death, I cry and feel his presence around me, and I speak to him.  I hear him speak back to me....sometimes.  It feels like a limb has been severed. And no one can love you as much as your Dad.  Even when he wasn’t perfect, he was your Dad.  As time continues on, you will absorb his love, his spirit, and realize he is part of you.  He loves you even now and he forever will."
