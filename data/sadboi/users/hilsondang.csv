schizoaffective,fpic0ag,t1_fpi51m6,1588637805.0,"thank you! and somewhat. it was more of a conceptual piece of a not so drug free time i had in the past. a lot of my pieces have people in them that indirectly represent my phobia of people. that can correlate with my hallucinations bc of the auditory premonitions that i may or may not act upon. lol sorry for the long winded explanation. so in a general sense, yes."
Psychosis,fpepd8f,t1_fn99qq7,1588552101.0,i love ur perspective on this. i can relate to it because of how psychotic attachment can very much lure me into a weird cycle. thank you :)

Psychosis,f6xhf9u,t1_f6x5abi,1573249635.0,yeah that is actually very similar. i was in an abusive (both sides were at fault) relationship and it seems i was always expending myself too much relative to my own needs. and there's a lot more that went down that was really obscure in this piece aside from that relationship but yeah lol.
schizoaffective,f6xh3ox,t1_f6x9uwn,1573249445.0,i probably will! didn't know about this thread!

schizoaffective,eyjygr8,t1_eyjhk51,1567131687.0,i really hate being so sad and angry at times too because the smallest emotion will latch on to my past and just make me have a horrible night ya know?
schizoaffective,eyjyaa4,t1_eyjhk51,1567131547.0,It was mainly done with the idea of seeing something wholesome in an anime that was irrelevant to the story line but appreciating how it made me feel! i also love guiding the viewer's eye in a lot of my artwork!
