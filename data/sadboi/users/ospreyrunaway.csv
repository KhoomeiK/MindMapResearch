Is this meant to be a threat? Why the fuck should I be scared of you?

You realize that even if you are trained in martial arts, you’re not allowed to... attack people? You still go to jail for assault.

This was literally just a vent about how I’m a bit concerned about my compulsions to violence that probably relate to my other mental health issues. 

Are you okay? I’m seriously confused as to where your ramblings on your high horse about how powerful you are came from.

If you can manage to not cut until then (not judging if you can’t. I understand the struggle.) then they might be just healed enough for you to claim that they’re old and not to worry.

Or alternatively you could cover one arm (whichever has the most scars) with drawings with a nontoxic marker, so if you have to take off your jumper then they’ll only see one arm? Like you could draw over the scars just in case they make you take the whole jumper off. Or just ask if you can roll up your sleeve on your nonscarred arm.

This sounds like it’d be good for me. 

Personally I prefer happy music because it keeps me from dwelling on sadness. However some sad songs are so relatable and beautiful it’s hard not to listen to them. The ones I have to avoid most of the time are ones that make me nostalgic. I like them but they make me too sad. To each their own though! Whatever works!"

mentalhealth,f8tyt96,t1_f8tv6gh,1574814687.0,"However, suicide proofing can actually be really helpful.

It can be triggering for suicidal people to see things they could use to kill themself. Or things they could possibly use to kill themself.

Yeah it’s not guaranteed that a suicidal person won’t try again. No matter how proofed the house is. But not seeing those kind of things can really help. 

When my self harm instruments were missing, I was too tired to find another way to do it because of depression. So I just didn’t cut. I’m assuming it’s the same thing with suicide, or at least it can be."

toastme,f8tyhd7,t1_f8tgco9,1574814443.0,"I’m pretty good at other subjects. But I’m so bad at math it basically shoots me in the foot. I want to get into a good college for my writing and creative talents but my GPA is holding me back .

I really don’t know what my problem is. No matter how hard I try the concepts just don’t click. They haven’t since I was a kid. Because of this it makes it almost impossible to focus on math. I won’t understand it either way so why bother?"
toastme,f8tg2id,t1_f8tfu5u,1574802636.0,Unfortunately broke my clean streak soon after typing. But regardless. Thank you for your comment. It means a lot.
mentalhealth,f8teu9o,t3_e22opb,1574801899.0,"I’m like this too, but I also get upset when nobody ever validates me/validates other people constantly for something I also do. It’s fucking weird. I’m simultaneously a narcissist and a self hating prick. I am jealous.

Despite being worse than literally everyone else, I get upset when they’re complimented for being good at something."
SelfHarmScars,f8te9ps,t3_e0uabc,1574801563.0,Late comment but I harm myself in the same spot. I hope I can make it as long as you
selfharm,f8scmo3,t3_e1yam3,1574777090.0,"Literally had the urge to stand up in math and scream “I am going to kill myself” it was absolutely horrible and I fucking hate myself. 

I’m such a lazy piece of stupid shit and my teacher knows it. He kept glaring at me while he yelled at my class for being lazy and doing badly on a quiz. He said some people didn’t get above single digits on an out of 30 quiz. I know he was talking about me because he looked at me the whole time."
Dermatillomania,f8p21zn,t1_f8owr1h,1574694345.0,Oh god the grabbing is so aggravating. My mom does it. She’ll grab or touch my hand whenever I’m picking and it stresses me so muchhh. Especially because I hate being touched. I always want to just slap her in the face when she does it.
AskReddit,f8cepgl,t1_f8bx5gd,1574458670.0,"It’s generally pretty easy to tell if it’s cutting, but self harm isn’t only cutting so you’re right in that regard! 

Cutting is usually easy to identify because of the clean straight lines. It’s not the same for everyone but it’s what I see the most often and from what I can tell it’s the most ‘popular.’ 

Other types are a lot harder to tell. Burning doesn’t leave those clean scars and people can be burned in other ways than self harm. Scratching at the skin, in my experience, leaves scars that resemble bruises if you don’t look closely. People often only take into account cutting, but other forms of sh exist and are quite common if you look into support groups and other discussion places."
AskReddit,f8c2nzq,t1_f8c0ff0,1574451026.0,"That’s valid but what if they never mention their issues with you?

A lot of my friends have issues I can’t help with but they’re still friends"
AskReddit,f8bwbfh,t3_e03okw,1574446819.0,"Should really have marked this as serious. The replies are already becoming troll-y. 

I feel an immediate connection to them because I have scars of my own. I want to say something about it, but I know from personal experience that can be unhelpful and triggering. But I also don’t want them to think that nobody cares. It’s very conflicting. I normally either panic and don’t say anything, or compliment them. Nothing relating to their scars. Just their outfit or their hair or their makeup or really anything. I know how much positive comments can mean."
toastme,f87q1a3,t1_f86uxqk,1574339825.0,Ah I’m sorry u saw the scars! I’m sending major hugs your way. Stay strong man ❤️
toastme,f86ipui,t3_dyuutj,1574299201.0,"Weird as fuck thing to point out, but your scalp is really clean. I compulsively pick at my skin and my scalp is a mess, so it’s something I always notice. I’d actually love to have the same scalp, bald or not. 

from what I can tell, you are incredibly kind and empathetic. You’re the type of guy who puts the world on his shoulders, whether he can handle it or not. The world is a dark place, and being a figure of light, it’s hard to exist knowing that so much out there really sucks. But just know that you are bringing light to the world just by being in it. You make more of a difference than meets the eye, I’m certain of it. 

Also, ain’t no shame in bushy eyebrows! I think they suit you and just add to how handsome you look. But if you have an issue with them, you can always experiment with online brow tutorials. Many of them are geared towards more femme men/women, but there’s bound to be one that will fit your face if that’s not your scene. :)"
