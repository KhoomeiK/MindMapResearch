The one thing I am thankful for is a family that is understanding of mental health so I know I have them in my corner for those tough times if they come.

This peer reviewed article's conclusion states:

Gastroparesis,fp1v1m5,t3_ee49iw,1588248606.0,"I am currently 6 weeks pregnant and I've had gastroparesis for 8 years now, along with other complications from abdominal surgeries. I have a G.I specialist, and when I told him about my plan to become pregnant, he helped me through every step. He also referred me to a high risk pregnancy program. It is possible, and as my experience right now it is difficult, but possible. At this point I am extremely nauseous and vomiting throughout the day, I can eat around 7:00 at night. Although, my mother was this sick during her first trimester and she does not have gastroparesis. I think the most important thing would be to look for any high risk pregnancy programs near you so you can be monitored more closely, if you chose to conceive. Also, when I was first diagnosed with gastroparesis I was extremely ill. I couldnt eat or drink, liquids are still horrible on my stomach. I dropped down to a scary weight. Since I've found my G.I specialist, we have found methods to help my symptoms. I am still chronically ill and don't live the same life as healthy people, but it is way more manageable.
