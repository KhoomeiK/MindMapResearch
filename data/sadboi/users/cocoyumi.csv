plantclinic,fhhnz3c,t3_f3b4xf,1581608297.0,"One of my plant care guides (idk the title right now sorry), says it’s normal for leaves to fall after repotting, because there is a balance between the water lost by the leaves and the water absorbed into the roots. If the roots are damaged during repotting, which can happen very easily, then the plant can’t keep up with the demand of water lost through transpiration and leaves fall. That’s why if you repot a plant and damage roots it might be a good time to also prune the plant. Hope that makes sense"

***When you were born a golden ticket was slipped into your soul’s pocket by your Creator. The ticket gave you privileged access to a world of choices- it granted you permission to be whoever you wanted to be and do whatever you wanted to do.

You can either stand still and live in yesterday or you can step through the gates of possibility and into the life you were truly meant to live.  
The only price of admission is to release any anger, hurt, worry or resentment tied to your old story and to have the clarity and strength to start anew. You can make new choices. You can live more fully. You can love more completely. You can make a greater difference. Every moment is a second chance to unleash and claim the life of purpose and contribution that is your destiny. But beware. The only promise in life is that soon the gates will close, as there are only so many moments left to live, love and matter. Stand still or step forward?

SkincareAddiction,fbr4cn4,t1_fbpkq2i,1577039000.0,Vaseline is unfortunately pretty misunderstood.

An AHA could really help if you’re not using  one already, maybe lactic acid as you already have dry skin (it’s the gentlest AHA).

You're right, i haven't tried azelaic acid yet, i will look into that, as well as trying to identify if it may be fungal (i don't think it is, most of the apparent symptoms are the opposite for me, its not itchy, inflamed or with white heads, just hard skin coloured bumps that  are sometimes so deep they can't be extracted without creating a big deep hole on my face)  
I do find the retinoid helps, i was considering trying a stronger strength next if i hadn't found any other options. 
I'm almost certain none of my products are causing them, i did introduce the cerave cream recently but the intensity of the CC's remains the same as before i used it. I've had them persistently for around 4 years.

**Skin type;**  
Dry to normal, prone to dehydration, large pores and prone to CC’s everywhere except forehead. 

**Issue:**
I can’t seem to shake my CC’s. I’ve tried a few things and nothing really seems to help too much, or helps at first but then kinda plateaus (ie, stridex). 
The downside is my skin is also extremely prone to dehydration and the stridex contributes. I was using a cocktail of exfoliators, but cut my routine down recently and my skin is recovering well but the CC’s are blooming. 

**Tried:**
-Stridex maximum (salicylic acid)
-Paula’s choice 2% BHA liquid (salicylic acid)  
-Pixi glow tonic (glycolic acid).  
-AHA’s including Paula’s choice 8% AHA liquid  
-TO 30% AHA + 2% BHA peel 
-Dermaplaning (helps a lot but not completely)  
-OCM (helps a lot but mostly SF’s)
-Routine is completely non comedogenic  
-Change my pillowcase regularly  
-Limit touching my face- my SO too, much to his sadness :(   
-Eliminated dairy and wheat (seemed to help a little)  
-Shampoos / conditioner are silicon free and only hair products I use  
-Purchased an aqua bliss shower filter for good measure 


**Routine** 
 AM:  
-rinse with water or sometimes cerave hydrating cleanser if face feels dirty  
-TO Niacinamide + Zinc  
-TO buffet  
-Cerave in the tub  
-Vaseline on T-zone (most dehydrated area)  
-Neutrogena clear face acne prone spf 30  

 PM;  
-Cerave hydrating cleanser  
-TO Niacinamide + Zinc  
-TO buffet  
-TO 2% retinoid in squalane (every 2nd day)  
-Cerave in the tub  
-Vaseline on T-zone 

Is there anything obvious I’m missing that might help the CC’s?
