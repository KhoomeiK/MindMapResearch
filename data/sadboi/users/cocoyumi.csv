plantclinic,fhhnz3c,t3_f3b4xf,1581608297.0,"One of my plant care guides (idk the title right now sorry), says it‚Äôs normal for leaves to fall after repotting, because there is a balance between the water lost by the leaves and the water absorbed into the roots. If the roots are damaged during repotting, which can happen very easily, then the plant can‚Äôt keep up with the demand of water lost through transpiration and leaves fall. That‚Äôs why if you repot a plant and damage roots it might be a good time to also prune the plant. Hope that makes sense"

You're right, i haven't tried azelaic acid yet, i will look into that, as well as trying to identify if it may be fungal (i don't think it is, most of the apparent symptoms are the opposite for me, its not itchy, inflamed or with white heads, just hard skin coloured bumps that  are sometimes so deep they can't be extracted without creating a big deep hole on my face)  
I do find the retinoid helps, i was considering trying a stronger strength next if i hadn't found any other options. 
I'm almost certain none of my products are causing them, i did introduce the cerave cream recently but the intensity of the CC's remains the same as before i used it. I've had them persistently for around 4 years.

**Skin type;**  
Dry to normal, prone to dehydration, large pores and prone to CC‚Äôs everywhere except forehead. 

**Issue:**
I can‚Äôt seem to shake my CC‚Äôs. I‚Äôve tried a few things and nothing really seems to help too much, or helps at first but then kinda plateaus (ie, stridex). 
The downside is my skin is also extremely prone to dehydration and the stridex contributes. I was using a cocktail of exfoliators, but cut my routine down recently and my skin is recovering well but the CC‚Äôs are blooming. 

**Tried:**
-Stridex maximum (salicylic acid)
-Paula‚Äôs choice 2% BHA liquid (salicylic acid)  
-Pixi glow tonic (glycolic acid).  
-AHA‚Äôs including Paula‚Äôs choice 8% AHA liquid  
-TO 30% AHA + 2% BHA peel 
-Dermaplaning (helps a lot but not completely)  
-OCM (helps a lot but mostly SF‚Äôs)
-Routine is completely non comedogenic  
-Change my pillowcase regularly  
-Limit touching my face- my SO too, much to his sadness :(   
-Eliminated dairy and wheat (seemed to help a little)  
-Shampoos / conditioner are silicon free and only hair products I use  
-Purchased an aqua bliss shower filter for good measure 


**Routine** 
 AM:  
-rinse with water or sometimes cerave hydrating cleanser if face feels dirty  
-TO Niacinamide + Zinc  
-TO buffet  
-Cerave in the tub  
-Vaseline on T-zone (most dehydrated area)  
-Neutrogena clear face acne prone spf 30  

 PM;  
-Cerave hydrating cleanser  
-TO Niacinamide + Zinc  
-TO buffet  
-TO 2% retinoid in squalane (every 2nd day)  
-Cerave in the tub  
-Vaseline on T-zone
