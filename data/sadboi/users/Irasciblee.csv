LongDistance,fkpx7bo,t3_fjx6ay,1584422211.0,"Idk if youâ€™ve done this, but whenever I canâ€™t think of something to gift someone I write down everything that reminds me of them. Their favorite food, memories of them, even their hair color lol. I can usually think of something based on the list, and it might also help in writing him letters :) Good Luck! I bet heâ€™ll love whatever you decide to give him!"
