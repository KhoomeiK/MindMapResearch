I publicly came out in 2015, on the day that the Supreme Court handed down the marriage equality ruling.

I've been attracted to other guys ever since high school (I later realized that I was in love with one of my best guy friends), but I *still* really haven't given myself permission to explore what dating other guys could look like. I met a couple of guys for coffee last year, but never followed through on anything because I was too afraid (which is a shame because both of them were *really* nice).

All of my romantic relationships have been with women because it's what I'm used to, but I'm starting to feel rather curious about meeting a guy again and seeing what happens."

Hey everyone üëã I haven't been on here in a long time, and I have a lot to share.

My most recent relationship ended last week after being together for four months after meeting through a mutual friend. Her (let's call her K) and I ended up being two very different people with two very different sets of wants/needs. We tried to bridge the gap, but it proved to be too difficult. I'm warm and affectionate whereas K is cold and petty and downright mean at times.

So, I did something this weekend for myself that I'd never really done before: I went on a solo roadtrip on Saturday and ended up having the best time. I went to a place called The Ohio Caverns and capped the day off at my favorite bookstore. I also re-upped my gym membership yesterday and that felt really good too.

Obviously I'm going to take the time I need to grieve the end of the relationship, but I've already decided that I'm never going back to the various OLD apps. I get addicted to the swiping and the constant waiting for notifications fairly easily, so I have no desire to put myself through all of that.

I'm going to keep traveling on my own and hitting the gym. I'm not quite sure how I'm going to meet someone else when the time is right, but I'm actually excited by this new direction my life is taking. I also started a really good new job at the beginning of the month, so things really are looking up!
