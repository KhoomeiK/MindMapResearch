loseit,etzoo5h,t3_ce3ayj,1563334749.0,"You can do it! I watched this talk from DrMcDougall about The Starch Solution on YouTube and I dropped five pounds within two weeks. I don’t stick to it rigidly anymore at all, but it was a very helpful talk and he mentions a lot of his patients with diabetes etc. that were helped. It may be worth a shot watching if you have the time"
WeightLossAdvice,etznx7q,t1_etyuc7j,1563334438.0,Wow this is so well said! I love the analogy of treating it like a road trip and also building habits from mistakes instead of feeling the whole week was wasted! Thanks for this

loseit,ethu43c,t1_ethu148,1562827428.0,Hahaha I had a feeling you must follow McDougall! Starchivores woohoo!
loseit,ethtvdh,t1_ethnw69,1562827218.0,"Agreed! If you read Dr.McDougalls work he talks a lot about having patients ADD 6 cups of white rice to their usual daily diet and even then, they end up losing weight. He states this is because your body doesn’t easily turn starchy carbohydrates into fat and thus the excess is burned off as heat"

I think upping the calories and going for the long run is a great idea. Also I really like your view on treating this like a marathon and not a sprint. I’m going to take this advice to heart.
