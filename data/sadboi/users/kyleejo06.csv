homeowners,fqtoiot,t3_gku03s,1589642999.0,"Have your realtor run comps to see if the appraisal is reasonable. The appraisers that are sent by the bank often aren't familiar with the area and may be using properties in different neighborhoods, school districts, etc that could drastically affect the valuation. 

If the appraisal seems legitimate in that it aligns with what the bank said, then have your realtor negotiate the sellers down and share the comps with them. If the appraisal from the bank appears to be flawed, then try a different lender or protest the original appraisal. 

If the bank can't approve you for a loan, most real estate contracts specify that you receive back your earnest money. You should be able to walk away without losing anything. If that's true, it's a big bargaining chip you have in pressuring the seller to lower their price. If your contract specifies that they keep the earnest money, then they'll be less inclined to negotiate with you. Ask your realtor about this verbiage in the contract. 

Hopefully this means you can get the house for less. That's especially true if the house has been on the market a while and if you can walk away with your earnest money. But without a new appraisal, your choices are to walk away or to cover the difference by bringing money to closing. I'm not sure how much you were planning to put down, but you'd have to cover the difference. The seller needs to realize that as well - that their only option is going to be a cash buyer or someone with a large down payment. Hopefully that realization pushes them to reevaluate their asking price."

changemyview,fpt44t7,t3_gf6xzh,1588884536.0,"Muslims in America are a minority group that experiences discrimination. This is why liberal people tend to voice support of Muslim communities - not because anyone is advocating for belief in Islam or its tenets of faith, but because American liberals stand up against discrimination.

In the US, Christians experience a privilege not shared by other groups of faith or even those without Faith. We have ""In God We Trust"" emblazoned on our currency, ""one nation under God"" in our pledge of allegiance, a national prayer breakfast and day of prayer, government officials who are sworn in on a Bible, and even the ten commandments on courthouse lawns. Islam is not represented in these things and Muslims are likely to be discriminated against or to experience hate crimes. This imbalance in religious freedom and Christian privilege is the enemy of American liberalism and goes against the tenet of Separation of Church and
State championed by our Founding Fathers.

I believe in equity and that one person's rights end where another begins. I believe that people should be free to practice whatever faith they wish and wear what they like. Some people draw comfort and meaning from religious ideology and it's not my place to criticize that or take it from them. But when those rights bleed over into government, that's an issue. If a Muslim woman wants to wear a hijab, I see no issue. The religious right does. Whereas both like to tell women to stay silent. And they're both backwards for views like that. And when they try to legislate from the pulpit, that's a giant issue.

I don't view Islam as the religion of peace. In fact, religious differences is the leading cause of war and death in the world today. I don't view Christianity as something liberating either - well, unless you're a straight, white, cis male. And even then, I'm not so sure. Regardless, I'm not advocating for the elimination of either faith. We should all be able to coexist and live life on an equal playing field without institutionalized discrimination against one group or preference of another. Right now, that preference and privilege belongs to American Christians. Thus, in fighting that privilege and the resulting discrimination, liberals will defend Muslims...and Sikhs, atheists, Hindus, Wiccans, Jews, Satanists, agnostics, etc."

That might mean you are committed to an inpatient treatment facility for teenagers. In such a program, you will receive access to a psychiatrist and therapy. Their primary focus is stabilization - to get you stable via the use of medication. Once the immediate threat to yourself ends, you would likely be transferred to a PHP (partial hospitalization program) or an IOP (intensive outpatient program) to receive the same services for a portion of the day.

This help would not be something your parents could deny if you made the statements at school. What is going to trigger this process is if you (1) say that you want to die, and (2) say that you have a plan of action to hurt yourself. So if those are things you're feeling, you need to be open and honest with someone at school.

Additionally, if you're not to the point of active suicidality, you do have counselors are school. Some schools also employ social workers and psychologists. These resources may also be available to you.

**School Type:** Public high school (9-12)

**Breakdown of time spent per day:**  
**Instructional time:** 6 classes, 53 min per class  (I have only 5 classes per day, as I receive additional planning time as a team leader)

**Other (passing period) supervision:** 7 minute passing period, teachers are encouraged to stand at door to monitor

**(Unpaid) lunch:** 30 minutes  

**Before school (paid) time:** 10 min

**After school (paid) time:** 30 min  

**Planning time per day:** one 53-minute class period (as a team leader, I get an additional 53-minute period a day that is only given to department chairs and team leads)

**Total time spent at school:** 8 hours on contract; although I'm always there earlier in the morning than required and stay later than needed.

**Total students:**  ~135 (most teachers have about 25 more students at my school due to an additional class to teach)

**Class size:** smallest class is 15 and the largest is 27 (10th and 11th grade)

**SpEd students:** 5-10% fall under the SpEd umbrella, I have a larger population under the 504 umbrella (other content areas have higher proportions of students receiving SpEd services, but I teach physics, so many don't make it to me)

**Thoughts about my workload:** When my team of teachers works together and shares the workload, it's manageable. When they slack off, I have to pick up the slack and then address it. It can be stressful, but it's better than the last school I was at. We definitely don't have enough paid time to plan for all that we do and there is a significant amount of work outside of school hours. I do try my best not to bring it home with me though.

**Pay scale:** my district's starting pay for a brand new teacher is about $55,000. My pay (year 7) is around $60,000 (bachelor's degree)"

relationship_advice,fbydkr4,t3_ef0atu,1577214216.0,"This reminds me of why I left organized religion. OP, this is not normal behavior by any party involved.

(1) Your pastor has no business having your girlfriend's passwords or reading her messages. He clearly can't even take care of himself and his relationships. He's also behaving in an extremely predatory manner given is position of power over your girlfriend. That's spiritual abuse and sexual harassment (even if she is reciprocating) due to the imbalance of power. That man has no business being a spiritual leader. His behavior needs to be exposed and he needs to resign or be fired. Take screenshots and share those with your church elders or leadership team.

(2) Set clear boundaries and relationship expectations. If you're not okay sharing your girlfriend with other men (or women, who knows) and if she's violated that, then you need to end your relationship. It sounds like you already set that boundary...in the most f*cked up way possible, but still. If you want to do a reset and try to handle the situation like adults, then go for it. Start with a conversation - a discussion with input from her as well, not just a list of rules that you set. If you don't want the same things out of a relationship, then you have your answer. Not everyone is compatible.

(3) Women don't need digital chaperones. If the only thing between her and another guy's dick is a babysitter, then you're going to be disappointed. No one can watch her 24/7 and they shouldn't need to. She's an adult and her choices are her's to make. You either accept them or you don't, and then you respond accordingly.

(4) Monogamy isn't for everyone. Either you're both in the same relationship or you're not. If monogamy is something she wants but struggles to maintain, then have her try therapy, not a spiritual babysitter. There are various traumas or disorders that a person can experience that could result in a difficulty maintaining a monogamous relationship ranging from childhood physical or sexual abuse, depression, personality disorders (BPD, NPD, HPD...), addiction, etc that can be worked through in a therapy setting. 



Please don't look to your church to solve your problems. It's an institution made up of men - fallible and faulted and human. If you want to pray, then have at it, but the church won't be the end all be all answer. As you've seen, that route is fraught with its own pitfalls and issues.


EDIT TO ADD: 
As for the disappearing messages, there are chat apps that automatically do this. Most people are familiar with this function in Snapchat, but it's not the only one. Facebook has a secret messenger built in to its mobile chat app. You have to turn on the service, as it's not done by default. Messages sent via this service are only accessible on the phone sending/receiving the messages. They can't be viewed on a computer that's logged in to that same account. The messages can be set to disappear after a certain amount of time in screen, ranging from seconds to a day to not at all. This is set by the sender. If saw a message from him disappear on her phone, it's because the pastor set it to do that. If you saw her reply disappear, it's because she set it to do that. But if she was using Facebooks secret messenger, then it's mere existence on her phone means she was complicit because she had to turn it on. If it was another app, then she would have installed it and that's pretty telling also."

personalfinance,f8p1u8v,t1_f8otr5z,1574694239.0,"A 15 year mortgage literally only makes sense if you get half the interest rate. Since that's not happening, just do the 30 year. It gives you the ability to invest money and keeps more of it liquid. That's a better return than saving half a percent on something you're locked into for 15 years. Plus, when you go 30 year, if want to pay the house off early, it's always an option.

Also, figure out what you want to pay monthly for the house (plus taxes and insurance). Work backwards from there. I just bought a house and since I'm a single mom and a teacher, I really didn't want to go over $1500/mo (with taxes and insurance escrowed). I could have been approved for more, but I didn't want to pay more than that just to keep the same standard of living that I was accustomed to. For me (in Texas), that meant ~$180K loan. I was able to figure out how much of a down payment I wanted to put down in order to shop in specific price ranges."

AMA,f6zna2w,t1_f6zat1f,1573318916.0,"My friends at the time tried their best to support me, but they were ill-equipped to do so. We were kids. Just like you are now. They didn't understand why I didn't get better or why I still talked about nearly 2 years later. They didn't understand why I was depressed most of the time or had maladaptive coping mechanisms. It isn't your friend's faults if they don't have the ""right response."" But good friends try to be there as best they can. It's hard to go through abuse like that, but it's also hard for another kid - even a good friend - to process it or have an appropriate response. That's why having a trained therapist is so important. Schools have counseling staff (as you've mentioned), but most also have social workers that come through to work with kids in your situation and the state has counseling through child protective services and it's all 100% free. The more support you have, the better. Friends for a sense of belonging and support, and therapists and counselors to lay the provide the processing space and pathway for healing. 


All that to say, don't take it personally if your teenage friends don't say the right thing or don't understand why you're not ""over it"" or better. They honestly don't know and that's not their fault or yours. I would hope the adults in your life aren't saying that, but again, it sounds like they're not the most supportive. I was lucky in that I had the support of my father and stepmom, even though my mom was awful to me at the time. My teachers were amazing and supportive as I struggled with the trauma through high school. That's why I became one - a high school teacher. Take the support where you can get it, because finding that help does become harder upon leaving high school.


And give yourself time to heal. Take it one day at a time. There's not a set time table. It's hard not to internalize the ""why aren't you over this yet"" message and start to wonder if you are supposed to be better by now. You're supposed to be right where you are in your own journey. For me, that's addressing the C-PTSD that still manifests itself in my life and rewriting my story - finding healthy outlets when I'm triggered, stressed, or overwhelmed. I made so many mistakes and bad choices along the way and reached out the the wrong things or people to take the pain away along my journey. But even if I took the path through the thorns and darkness, I still managed to come out on the other side. It took me years and I've still not ""arrived."" I'm still growing and learning. And that's the key - keep moving. Don't get stuck in this. Keep fighting through. And know that you don't have to fight alone or in the darkness. Find your tribe and let them fight with you. But as long as you keep moving and doing the next right thing, you're doing it your right way. "
AMA,f6z3213,t3_dts468,1573307597.0,"I could have written this, except that mine stopped at 15 and started a little later too (8 or 9). I'm in my 30s now, so I assume I'm a few years ahead in the recovery process. 

Did you get counseling via CPS? I assume that's standard practice, but if you're still a minor and not receiving support, please reach out to them. It's 100% free for children in abusive situations.

And for some life advice - regardless of what support you receive now, you will need more down the road. I remember feeling ok for the first time in my life right around 18 or 19 and thinking ""I'd gotten past it."" Only to realize how wrong I was when presented with various life milestones and experiences. Dating others was more complicated and I had trauma responses to certain sexual acts or even physical ones. It's something I still have to work on to this day. Therapy is so important. I got help from CPS as a teen and then thought I was ok after being a few years removed from the abuse. It wasn't until I was in my 30s that I started to put in the time and money towards my mental health and betterment of self. I go to therapy weekly, because it turns out that my childhood experiences still affect me in ways that I could have never foreseen. I have trust issues, lack appropriate coping responses to everyday stresses, struggle with appropriate relationships and boundaries, etc. It's not just sex and intimacy that were affected.

For some encouragement - it does get easier. I don't think about it everyday or anywhere near that. I haven't for years. I'm just dealing with the fallout. But that gets easier too as you learn how to trust and meet people worth your trust. You learn what love and respect looks like. Boundaries are a good thing and you can learn those too. But don't try to do it alone. I know it's easy to withdraw when you don't have familial support. I did the same thing when my mom didn't believe me. It took her years, but she apologized last summer. Our relationship isn't great, but we're at a place to work on that.

And one last thing that I always wanted to hear - this is not your fault. Even if it felt ""good"" at times, even if you didn't kick or yell or scream, even if you didn't say anything for years about it happening. You were a child coping in the only way you knew how. You didn't choose this. He did. You are worth respect, you are valued, you are beautiful, and you are worth loving. You didn't deserve this. Love yourself. Don't despise your body. And don't let anyone tell you that you are less than."

That said, I had a discussion with my ex about it first. Although I think it was difficult for him, he agreed to allow me to explore that because it was honestly information that we both needed to know.

Perhaps she didn't feel like the option was actually there in your relationship and it was something she felt she needed to know. I say that more as a possible explanation as opposed to an excuse. What she did was absolutely a violation of your trust. If you want to stay with her or explore that possibility, you might need to revisit that conversation about opening things up with the explicitly stated expectation of open communication. If you do, realize that it could be the end anyway."
