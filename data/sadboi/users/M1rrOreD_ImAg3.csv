In brief: In my childhood, my siblings *overtly teased me*, one of my parents mindlessly *yelled at me* about everything and the other parent didn't defend me as much as I would've wanted them to (and thus it feels I never had a loving family). I was *bullied* in school for almost the entire duration of it, eventually my then-friends started *bossing me around* as well and I changed schools a total of three times in six years due to in part unclear reasons (it was never explained to me).

**Additionally**, I was given a psychological diagnosis in my youth based on extremely thin reasons, which I to this day doubt in some way (whether it was justified). I've had suicidal thoughts ever since I was a [small] child - currently, I'm in my mid-twenties.

The things that pushed me through are my willpower, my closest friends (who I've known for 3-6 years and who are the only ones who know my complete story) and the recently-finished five-year psychotherapy - as well as deep, regular and relaxing meditation. There's still much that persists (flashback episodes, general anxiety, doubting others' kindness etc.), and some things may never heal for good, but I'm determined not to give up after having already come this far in life. *You can get through all of this, I promise* ❤️"

Despite the pushing, they are yet to leave me, though - mainly out of care, loyalty and solidarity, I presume. However, *many* other people have, even though I never told them about my trauma, which makes it so that I don't have too many friends left and I'm nowadays very careful about opening up to anyone to any extent. I'm also trying to meditate regularly, since it tends to keep my ""episodes"" in check at least in some way.

I also feel almost zero connection to my siblings, due to them having it ""perfect"" [mild exaggeration] in their lives and because they were never abused as I was.

**Subsequently**, I almost hate myself and generally avoid contacting people ""for no reason"" so I wouldn't feel stupid - or feel anger towards others for them ""avoiding"" me.

These days, as an adult, I've lost many people from my social circles due to them simply having stopped talking to me at some point (for some reason) - more precisely, they ghosted me while I was trying to talk **or** became excessively passive in all their interaction. They had just grown tired of me somehow, I guess.

All of this has then had an effect that I expect people to ignore me *so much* that I usually just stay silent and withdrawn among people - an aspect which has made me uninteresting and creepy in other people's eyes (with the result that I'm not talked to much...). **Thankfully**, I do have few such friends who have seen behind the lines and thus know how to deal with me - and, effectively, break the cycle of social ignorance.

CPTSD,flddwwk,t3_fo3v13,1585062534.0,"I can relate so much - I have this subconscious need to speak my mind, but because it wouldn't be socially acceptable, I always triple-check every message etc. before sending them to sort of ""censor the crap"". **However**, when talking with people whom I really trust, this self-monitoring most often fails and I talk too much - to a point that if I write short, my closest friends can even get worried whether all is fine...

It's really hard since no matter how emphatically someone would listen, they would never understand what we have to go through in our heads regularly. This ""wow to silence"" to ""filter the chaos"" to appear functional is maybe the hardest part of this, for me.

Wishing you all the best, you're not alone ❤️"
CPTSD,fld72t7,t3_fo1gdl,1585058160.0,"I can relate so much - as a child, I always felt it was my responsibility to protect my parents, from keeping them happy to making sure all was good with them. *However*, one of them did in fact abuse me (while the other enabled it), so nowadays it's most often them contacting me [I always still ask how they're doing].

As an adult, though, this responsibility has extended to other people as well, such as my closest friends and relatives. *I've always been the ultimate altruist who puts others before themselves, and it being the only life I've known, the habit is really hard to avoid*.

Wishing you all the best **and** remember that in the end, it's not your job to anyhow ""save"" others ❤️"
Coronavirus,fld37ku,t3_fo4s2q,1585055354.0,"Thank goodness - however, it really starts to seem that in some way, more or less, ""2020 is cancelled""...

Which just sucks big time (isolation and seemingly total eventlessness is simply put numbing as hell)."
CPTSD,flbll82,t1_flbikvy,1585007190.0,"You're not alone in this - being bi myself, I've in fact *fallen* for one of my closest friends accidentally in the past ; the search for (platonic) physical comfort and the emergence of my ""hunger for little more"" got mixed up, so I ended up ""checking them out"" in a way. Our friendship was almost ruined because of it. **Thankfully**, we were later on able to talk things through like grown-up adults, and all is good again.

I think these things have to do with the person's inner desire for some form of intimacy, e.g. how a child is looking for security by instinctively / naturally getting close to their caretaker so that they could give the child warmth and safety."
CPTSD,flbgqpp,t3_fnsnq9,1585004293.0,"Yes, I've had this for almost as long as I can possibly remember. As a child, I remember always talking to my grandparents far more than what would've been reasonable, **and** in high school still, I was always trying to stay in classroom *a tiny bit* longer than I should've simply to make the teachers talk with me ; I most likely did all this to find an adult in my life who would have the patience to listen to what I had to say.

As an adult, my closest friends are sometimes like this, in a way that when we meet face-to-face, I very often can just *talk and talk* about my life because I know they will listen to me - the difference to my previous (essentially) ""parent figures"" being that they know all about my issues and *are even sort of willing* to let me follow their lead **and** look up to them.

Wishing you all the best - and, being perfectly honest, if you can find someone who's like a ""parent figure"" to you (to compensate your own), I would say there's in fact nothing wrong with that whatsoever ❤️"
CPTSD,flazf7q,t1_flavyt9,1584994239.0,"Thank you so much for your reply - this is namely exactly what I've been thinking. I don't owe it to *anyone* if I didn't graduate now but only after the summer / in the early autumn. It's my degree and I finish it on my own pace, whether I had C-PTSD to carry as an additional weight or not; *besides*, it's not like my study time in the uni is about to end in the near future anyway (I still have one full year to use).

Regarding telling others about it, (as said below) my closest friends wouldn't most likely ""condemn"" this *[they know all about my pain, namely]* and if my grandparents end up asking me about it, I can just use the current world state as a totally valid excuse (""Isolation made me too depressed to focus on my remaining studies as hard and/or well as I should've"" *or something along those lines*).

Once again, thank you for your kind words ❤️"
CPTSD,flaw8vl,t1_flap49q,1584992391.0,"Thank you so much for your reply - the first time I read it, it almost made me tear up a bit, *n.g.l.*, haha.

This is exactly what I've been thinking as well, **on the positive side** : everyone's journey is different, and if I were to choose whether to write e.g. my Master's thesis in a month (in a huge rush of anxiety) **or** to give it an extra couple of months, I rather choose the latter - anytime, anywhere, anyhow. **Besides**, I'm pretty sure that e.g. my closest friends (among others) had already suspected this to happen, so telling them would be no huge twist. *Also, even if one didn't have the pain (of childhood trauma and neglect, etc.) that we have to carry, not everyone graduates in the fast lane (as you said)*.

Once more, thank you for your kind words ❤️"
CPTSD,fl9nemk,t1_fl9mp39,1584963188.0,"I actually have two different methods. **One** is that I use an app called ""Meditation Timer"" (can be found from Play Store on Android at least) and just clock 15min with it - eyes closed, sitting on a pillow, until the time passes *and* I feel refreshed and focused. **Another** is the similar method *except* instead of the app, I just play relaxing music of e.g. 5min length and let it loop couple of times to get the appropriate time frame (for meditation session). **Additionally**, I always wear headphones, since they silence all the outside sounds just enough.

Regarding you forgetting your little brother's birthday, I myself have a doctor appointment early tomorrow and I'm slightly scared I would forget it somehow... Your not alone with these strange times messing with one's memory, either."
CPTSD,fl9m9zp,t3_fneg7u,1584961912.0,"I had this growing up, *and still have* - partially, it's about my (**extremely** mild *supposed*) Asperger's and partially, it's just about trust [or lack thereof].

Growing up, I hated anything (or anyone) touching me because of my (apparent) ASD, but nowadays, I only genuinely e.g. hug people whom I trust enough - for everyone else, I hug them to resiprocate but not from my heart (that is, there's no emotion involved). **If I dared**, I would likely ask my closest friends if we could ""cuddle in a platonic way"" for me to get a peace of mind, but asking it is just too awkward.

CPTSD,fl9kvta,t3_fnhl65,1584960257.0,"I can relate, at least in some way - for me, the second week of isolation begins, but I've already lost my sense of time pretty much completely (have to think hard and consciously what day is presently at hand) **and** I've started to become increasingly apathetic towards everything (if I didn't essentially *force* myself to do something concrete, I would most likely just sleep all the time and/or let days go by in haze).

The isolation combined to loneliness (I've minimized social interaction voluntarily to focus on one task at hand, though), has thus made me to dissociate on a daily basis, and the thought of my friends is one of the only reasons why I've been able to ""stay sane"" (so to speak) this long. **However**, without almost daily meditation, my productivity would easily be at zero.

Wishing you all the best **and** let's hope this situation will be over sooner than later ❤️"
CPTSD,fl74f3t,t3_fn1vxu,1584893998.0,"I would say it's better to find an answer - finding one **will** most likely hurt, but in time, it will pass and you will gain (at least some sort of) peace of mind.

Before uncovering my own pain couple of years ago, I had been desperately looking for answers and had been in constant state of unease because of it. Once all eventually came clear to me, my life was sort of turned upside down ; I'm still hurt, but deep down, I have hope that the life will be better at some point. **Obviously**, for some questions I will presumably never find an answer (the ""why"" of things), but in the end, I'm sure that nothing good would come out it [if I knew].

CPTSD,fl4m0kb,t3_fm6k97,1584816431.0,"Yes, all the time more or less - even if I was in a room where one person ever so slightly raised their voice for another (and *I myself wasn't even being mad at*), my mind can immediately go to some form of ""fight or flight mode"", as if I was somehow preparing to defend myself. **Hell**, even if someone were to use a serious tone to point out something to me, I can easily interpret it as being somehow mad (in my head, at the very least).

This has its roots in a childhood (and youth) where everyone was always mad at me, sometimes even about completely non-existent / irrelevant things. It's like, I learned that every time someone uses (even) a specific tone of speaking, I'll be lectured. **Thankfully**, the people I now surround myself with have always acted in a calm manner with me.

CPTSD,fl4jrfh,t3_fm3qjw,1584815031.0,"I can very much relate to you - being a child, all of my interests were always criticised by everyone if I ever dared to open up about my e.g. hobbies.

Consequently, it's one of the biggest reasons why I'm not so liked socially. *To everyone, I'm namely a ""tabula rasa"", an enigma of whom one can't get any information out of* (to somehow talk about). I keep my cards so close to my chest that people normally need ""a patience of a saint"" so they can eventually get through to me (for me to open up).

Knowing I most likely won't find a job, despite being (almost) broke, after getting my degree, is keeping me in a deep state of depression almost all the time - due to which I'm unable to focus on anything relevant. Everything feels meaningless, the uncertain future scares the crap out of me.
