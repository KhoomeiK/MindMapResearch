Like what you use to wipe off glasses and instead of putting it back in the case or the gamecube. Leave it out on a table for a few hours and that‚Äôs helped mine start to play for longer periods of time. I just stopped fucking with it in the gamecube when I would get the error and i did that and it‚Äôs better then it was"
Gamecube,fqq9wng,t1_fqpsbe7,1589561882.0,I bought super Mario sunshine from them on the website and the game wouldn‚Äôt play for more then 1 minute when I first got it. I ended up doing a few thing to the disc and got it goin again but still like cmon

eBaySellerAdvice,fqo244f,t1_fqo18ar,1589506009.0,Yupp Lol that was my initial thought was not to respond for a day or 2 to see if she pay then just open and unpaid case cuz clearly it‚Äôs bullshit or she needs to watch her kid lmao. Apparently the first 2 offers ($125 then $150) were her but the last 2 of $160 and $175 was her son. Honestly i think it‚Äôs just Bullshit and she thought by sending me this message I‚Äôd say ‚Äúokay $150 is fine‚Äù lol
eBaySellerAdvice,fqnkmlb,t1_fqnenm5,1589496553.0,Saame here. Relisted and got 2 watchers right away so we‚Äôll see  I‚Äôm hoping someone comes through tonight
eBaySellerAdvice,fqnbsi5,t1_fqn4bpd,1589492072.0,"Lmao I should have ! That‚Äôs a good one. My plan was to not respond for a day or 2 then see if she changed her mind over the $25 and just bought it or if she was just straight bullshitting about her son sending the other 2 offers after $150 to see if I‚Äôd message back and say ‚ÄúI can do $150‚Äù lol no idea.  I‚Äôm done though, cancelled the order and relisted and removed best offer feature"
eBaySellerAdvice,fqkkzx9,t1_fqkkpbs,1589429665.0,Appreciate that also. Honestly I might do that or just lower the price and not include best offer...ideally I‚Äôm trying to profit $100 or more off of this which I know is quite possible for what I‚Äôm selling but I paid $80 so if I get $160 I‚Äôll take it
eBaySellerAdvice,fqkjpd6,t1_fqkjh5r,1589428830.0,Appreciate it. Buyer sent me a delightful message saying that her son made the last 2 offers ($160 then $175) and can I please remove those offers and that she will not pay more then $150...gotta love eBay
