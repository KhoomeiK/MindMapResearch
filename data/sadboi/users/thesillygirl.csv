RelationshipAdviceNow,foxho83,t3_ga4ed3,1588144304.0,"You have to explain him about boundaries, meaning name calling is unacceptable. Seems like he has found the thing that hurts you and whenever he feels like getting back at you for something, he uses that for best results at hurting you.
Crying is not something you can control, especially when someone is yelling and calling you a bitch, so that is clear gaslighting, again, not acceptable.
I understand he might have his depression and anger management issues, and so he needs to work on them in therapy rather than projecting them on you. He helps you out, that's great but that does not give him the right to treat you poorly when he is upset.
I was in a similar relationship for 3 years. He had major anger issues and would do the same when I cried. The threw things around and punched walls. Never hurt me physically, but it was scary and aggressive. Even he suffered from depression. I kept convincing him to go to therapy but he would always refuse or put it off. I held on to the relationship thinking that all this will be okay once he agrees to go to therapy where depression and anger issues are dealt with. Held on for 3 years. Too long. Suffered a lot, and to be honest I resent myself for not leaving earlier.
You're with him for 7 months already. I'd suggest you talk to him about boundaries and discuss what bothers you. Suggest him therapy but don't force it much. Therapy only works if he's willing to make it work.
Give him a few months to change, if not it's better you leave instead of wasting too much of your time. 
Good luck!"

After I broke up, he says he wants marriage now and it ""doesn't sound so bad now"". That literally killed all my will to get married to him. The feeling that someone is doing that for anything but wanting to get married to you feels shit. A guy who even agrees due to an ultimatum is not someone you want to be married to. Trust me."

RelationshipAdviceNow,fnv5p6b,t3_g3w1vd,1587281130.0,"Are you generally a long distance couple or is this just during the pandemic? If it's the former then its okay to feel bad and ignored because your whole relationship would depend on this type of communication
But if it's the latter then I'd suggest that you understand and let go atleast until you start hanging out again. It's a little difficult for some people to switch from meeting to texting and they usually don't know what to say how to respond and tend to avoid such conversation altogether. I'm not saying its right on her part but I wouldn't judge the relationship based in this unexpected phase. If you still feel she's disinterested even after hanging out a few times when all this is over, then I'd give it a serious thought."

It might be difficult to understand for someone who has never faced the death of a close one, leading to thoughts of why you're greaving so much and assuming that you had a thing with him. This might be mostly because he doesn't understand how death affects the people around. (even though not family or romantically attracted) You can talk it out with your boyfriend and express your feelings, but also mention that its okay if he doesn't understand. I would suggest you to express your sadness in front of friends or family who'd understand. This might be understandable if he's not able to support you right now and you seek support from other people close to you."

You just have to remind yourself that they're an adult and can take care of themselves. You can always urge them to be more careful in general (like insisting they wear a helmet where needed or not avoiding visiting a doctor if something is wrong) but you also have to know that even if you are extremely careful, there are situations which might be out of your control. You have to ensure you don't overwhelm her with your worry else it can adversely affect your relationship. This pill is hard to swallow, I know.
But you have to turn this energy into showing her that she means a lot to you and you care for her. 
Keep reminding yourself that she is capable of looking after herself and she will be fine.
Good luck!"

RelationshipAdviceNow,fix7i61,t3_facbgn,1582814496.0,"I don't think all women ask for that, I think you just need to be true to yourself. You cannot be feeling less if you don't have money or looks or whatever. These things are not all there is to offer. Other positives that you have are equally, if not more important for a relationship.
The main difference is that looks and money shows. It shouts. Rest of the things need to be known, slowly and subtly.
Maybe you need to really understand what you have to offer which is in your control and how you can present it in the best way possible.
That being said, you need to accept this about women as well, you need to think whether you can accept someone overlooking their possessions and looks, if you do, you will find a really wonderful girl, who'll be lucky to have you!
I hope this helps, good luck!"

I am the generally responsible one. Even when I wasn't told not to drink before the surgery, I was off alcohol for about 2 months.

Join a gym. Start working out. This addiction will take care of itself. Try to keep good food ready at home. Don't force yourself to eat it, just keep it ready. More often than not, you'll feel like eating that, slowly you will end up eating this more times than junk food.

Why think of divorce rates if you love her and want to be with her all your life anyways? I can see why she got upset. It could be heart breaking to watch your SO think of divorce rather than a long happy life together. I think marriage  gives your life stability - practically and emotionally both. I mean getting a house is easier for married couples where I live, that's a practical approach. Emotionally, I feel a divorce calls for much serious reasons than a breakup, so anyone won't be as quick for a divorce as a breakup and that could make you try harder to understand and live with the one you love."

I tried to support him through the depression but nothing seemed to work, he never tried anything other than weed. He felt better when he would be high, and that's it. He said he was not addicted and could stop whenever he wanted, but after not smoking for a few days or weeks he would get angry and irritable. He lost happiness in normal daily things. He had no motivation to learn something new, or do better at work. I somehow convinced him to visit a psychiatrist and turns out it was weed all along. He has something called weed induced amotivational syndrome. He's been adviced to stay away from weed for atleast a year, and is on medication now.
