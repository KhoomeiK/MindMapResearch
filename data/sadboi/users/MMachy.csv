depression,fcffta9,t3_egzqgq,1577629555.0,"Trigger warning! 

I have scars on my wrists. The deepest one I've gotten were from when I really tried to end it all and I hit a vein. I bled a lot, my whole right hand was covered in blood. The cut wasn't that big, but it was deep. It's been 3? 4 months since then but the scar doesn't seem to go away 'til this body rots. I'm still conscious when people see some of my scars when I wear short sleeves/sleeveless.

What you feel is completely valid. Just know that harming yourself isn't the answer. I've been there, and up to this day I still regret it. I understand how hard it is to fight the urge. It happens. What you feel is real.

Do get professional help when you can.

I'm on my senior year, if I continue to fail this year, I'd have to try again and go through this fucking hell.

With all these simultaneous tasks given upon students like us, we have trouble trying to keep up with the rest of the other students that are deemed ""normal"" or ""excellent"" because there are other factors being thrown into the mix.

it's okay, even the luckliest people we know and love also suffer from said illnesses. trust me, a lot of famous actors, actresses, singers, performers, and etc. are also going through tough times because i highly doubt mental illness just forms by whatever is in your surrounding.

I always call this ""depression"" (dont want to assume since im not professionally diagnosed) as ""chemical imbalance.""
