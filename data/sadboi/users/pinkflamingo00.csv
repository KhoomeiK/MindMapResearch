Herpes,ex0xzar,t1_ex0l0dx,1565925052.0,How long did your subsequent outbreaks last for? Iâ€™m having my second one since my initial OB and itâ€™s pretty bad. Wondering how long itâ€™ll go on for... Iâ€™m taking Valtrax... but the symptoms seem to be staying the same.
Herpes,ex0xs2b,t1_ewwbuda,1565924898.0,"Slut year 2019!!! Made me laugh out loud. Thank you I so needed that. Basically same sitch for me, now suffering the consequences. Second OB since I got diagnosed and fuck this sucks. But honestly this sub helps so much. Thanks for the LOL"
Herpes,ex0x2uc,t1_ewxkfr2,1565924380.0,"Yeah wow, really sucks. Thanks for your response. How long do the outbreaks last for generally?"
Herpes,ex0wzn9,t1_ewvjgs3,1565924317.0,Thanks for answering me. Damn bummer. How long do the subsequent outbreaks last for usually?
Herpes,esv7sbj,t1_eslyrsi,1562295064.0,"Hi! Honestly I just blurted it out. I said I need to tell you something, I have herpes. But I got all the facts from my doctor too, so any questions he asked I had the answer ready. 80% of people have the virus, so he could already have it. I think honesty is key in relationships. My bf was really cool and understanding. But thereâ€™s still some issues because heâ€™s afraid to get it, so our sex life is a bit different because we always use condoms, and no more oral (for now) our next step is to go to my doctor together, so he can hear himself the stats, and how we can move forward having normal sex. I was also terrified to tell him, I thought I was going to puke. I had no idea how he was going to react.But he was so understanding, I was shocked. So you never know honestly. He may surprise you. If he loves you and heâ€™s a good dude, and your person, he will find a way to move past it. Almost everyone has it! I hope this was helpful. And just so you know, I was DEVASTATED when I first got diagnosed. And now Iâ€™m living a super normal life and barely think about it. It does get better!!! Good luck <3 reach out again if you need!"
