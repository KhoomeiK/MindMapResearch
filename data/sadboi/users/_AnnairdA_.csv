BlackGirlDiaries,fr53wjp,t1_fr51fcm,1589902052.0,It's alright.
BlackGirlDiaries,fr4zf5g,t1_fr4y7j7,1589899748.0,"First of all I've lived in many areas throughout my life and the most problems I've had are with black men. The area I'm in now is in a white area and I'm treated with respect and acknowledged, so I don't know what your talking about. The same happened when I was living in a hispanic area. No hispanic or white man has ever actively harassed me or followed me when I rejected them. I have to say this again, but I never said other men are absolutely safe and I mentioned that in the post.

Secondly, don't try to derail the conversation. I'm not talking about all races of men I'm talking about black men and the more the black community is in denial about how out of control and aggressive black men and boys actually are instead of talking about is the worse their behavior is going to get."
BlackGirlDiaries,fr4y2ie,t1_fr4veq0,1589899041.0,"Most of the black men I pass through are homeless too, harassing people looking for free handouts instead of filling out job applications. Some of them will try to talk to me, so they can take advantage and have somewhere to stay. The shit is sad. They would rather have a victim complex and still try to manipulate black women and girls even when their homeless instead of try to do things on their own."
BlackGirlDiaries,fr4976p,t1_fr3zcji,1589880331.0,"I think they expect us to protect them all of the time because their moms coddle them and if their father is in their life their usually a mess and don't discipline their son at all. 

I know men in general are pretty entitled, but it just seems like black men take it to another level. They seem to think if they speak to a black woman that we should be so grateful and let them fuck. Their constantly violating black women's boundaries and play victim when they get cut off."
BlackGirlDiaries,fr3s5r8,t1_fr3pxdq,1589864793.0," Your definitely right about how this happens to the majority of black women, but no one wants to come out about it. A lot of the stuff I said in my post was horrible, but honestly that's light compared to a lot of other black women's and girls experiences. The amount of black girls I heard being raped in high school by black boys and men was ridiculous. 

I do think a lot of black women especially the older generations (gen x and baby boomers) that coddle black men really doesn't make any sense. I don't understand why they do it, but all the brainwashing seemed to work because a lot of black girls in this generation do the same thing. Yeah I saw a video of a white man talking about how white women that end up with black men end up becoming single mothers. I'm going to look at the subreddit."
BlackGirlDiaries,fr3nl0r,t1_fr3m0a6,1589861460.0,"  I thought I already established that being around any kind of man of any race isn't safe, but I'm not going to pretend like black men aren't really aggressive.

I just feel like a lot of black men are more aggressive towards black women and girls because they know 9 times out of 10 they'll get away with it. There's so many black women and girls missing and not a whole lot of people care. We're really the most disrespected. The majority of black girls are sexually assaulted before the age of 18. There's way too many stories of black girls getting molested by one of their male family members and the family ignoring it or their mother turns around and beats them. The not all black men thing isn't really useful if it seems like the majority of them are predatory."
BlackGirlDiaries,fr3igzl,t3_gknf7v,1589858118.0,Yeah it is weird for someone to talk to their ex.

I can't agree on forgiving the people that bullied me, when I say bully I don't mean shoved in the locker room or teased for wearing certain clothes. I'm talking about threatened to get killed and beat up. I can't forgive that I can move on, but forgive and pretend like they didn't know any better? No. That's horrible and unforgivable to do to someone and it drove me to many suicide attempts. If that makes me a petty or bad person to not forgive those people then I guess I'm petty."

raisedbynarcissists,fqgcb8g,t1_fqg3awt,1589342723.0,"I don't agree with that. A lot of toxic people I've come across would never dare pull the shit they did with me to other people. The only other toxic person I allowed to stay for far too long besides my family was my ex and I cut him off. I didn't  ""allow"" the crazy bitch that got mad at me for going to the bathroom before her stay or anything like that. I established my boundaries and let her know that I wasn't going to back down. That didn't stop her from picking on me though. I think people take advantage of those who they think their weak and since I'm so small she thought I was someone easy to pick on. You want to know why I think this? A week before someone else went to the bathroom before her and she had no problem with it. She just say she will go to the bathroom downstairs, but with me all of a sudden its an issue?  People pick and choose who to take their anger out on."

raisedbynarcissists,fqgbhni,t1_fqg5461,1589342184.0,"I'm really sorry to hear you were sexually assaulted. I can relate to what you said minus the sexual assault.. I continued talking to my ex even after he dumped me (big mistake). He said he wanted to be ""friends"" with me, but quickly it turned sexual. We had this off and on pattern where one of us (usually me) would say I'm not talking to you again and would not speak for months just to end up speaking again. 

I do take personal responsibility because I should've just blocked and deleted him when he asked me if we could still be friends, but I didn't. I just feel like he took advantage of the fact that he knew I'm pretty much alone and put on this act that he was my ""best friend"".

I don't have too much life experience, but I do think you should cut off your ""friend"". Don't say anything just block and delete because he doesn't care for what you have to say.. What you said about him reminds me of what my ex pulled on me. Long story short a while ago when I was still living with my family I was losing my mind and I called him and was crying on the phone because everything was too much for me at the time. He gave me pretty generic advice telling me to calm down, but then all of a sudden he asked me if I wanted to have sex. I'm not going to lie but I gave in because I wanted the vaildation. I recently got some balls and cut him off again because I guess he got entirely too comfortable disrespecting me and decided to try to gaslight and manipulate me again because I said I wasn't comfortable talking to him anymore. 

I understand the last line. This World is so cruel that I feel like I'm becoming more distant..."

raisedbynarcissists,fqffffr,t1_fqfdi5z,1589323932.0,"I wouldn't say overly dominant their just rude as hell. I think even dominant people don't go out of their way to start drama with someone. 

I do need to work on the vibe I give off because I think I come across way as meek and people take advantage of that. On top of that having a baby face makes everything worse because no one really takes younger looking people seriously. People that age normally or faster than others aren't really going to understand what baby face people go through on a a daily basis, but let me tell you its very degrading.

People are always trying to take advantage of you when you look younger. When I used to work in customer service people would try to scare me into giving them a discount and the same people would treat someone my age who looks older better. I'm sure people do this because a lot of people believe that children should do whatever an adult tells them too, so looking younger a lot of people convince themselves that your a child and you shouldn't be taken seriously even if your older. I hope what I'm saying makes sense to you lol.

Honestly I do dress like a child, so I think I'm going to slowly change my wardrobe and appearance and get some self help books to work on the vibe I'm giving off. Your advice did help. Thanks."

We actually don't need anymore kids. Please explain why we need more children and I have a feeling your going to pull the ""we need more doctors,scientists, and what if your kid can cure cancer?"" card. 

There is no selfless reason that someone has a child. It is selfish to bring an unborn child into this World. If you have a child it's because YOU wanted to. It's naive to really try to pretend that having kids isn't selfish. If you have a kid your putting your kid in an unpredictable World where it's full of crime and danger. No matter how much you shelter your kid and give him or her the best life anytime can happen to your kid at anytime. I notice the people that are against this usually have kids or want kids and want to live in a fantasy where you think your kid is going to be safe.

raisedbynarcissists,fp4scb3,t1_fp252hq,1588306151.0,"Well having a kid is selfish because you have no idea where your child will end up.

A child can be in the best environment and can die at any moment (get murderered, a possible car accident, cancer, terminal illnesses, mental illnesses,etc) . A lot of people tend to think that if they have a kid for some reason that their child is so special and unique that those things can not happen to them and that's not true at all. If your willing to put an unborn child into this World knowing all of the possible horrible things that can happen to your kid then I consider that selfish. 

I'm I saying that all parents are evil,abusive and cruel? No, but it is pretty selfish to put an unborn child into the World knowing all of the bad things that happen often just so you can be satisfied."
raisedbynarcissists,fp1ojri,t1_fp1gxmw,1588242710.0,If it's not selfish to have a child then can you name a selfless reason a person might have a child?

raisedbynarcissists,fna1ovw,t1_fn9jvla,1586789305.0,"Do you have pure ocd or ocd in another form? Honestly I have no clue how my intrusive thoughts went away so quickly from one session. I think it's because I was finally validated and allowed to relax during the session. When I was in my room all day I thought that my mom was right about me not being able to do anything and how I wasn't capable of doing anything on my own without her. I had no one to talk to besides her, so I thought that what she was saying was true and that I was useless. During my session I didn't bash my mother I just simply brought up the stuff that was going on and my therapist could tell that she was a problem. I was also relieved because when I was finally validated that my mom was a problem I started to plan my escape from the house. I knew I couldn't change her, so I started planning on how I was going to leave and left 2 months afterwards. 

My mom's boyfriend acted the same way. He would have these outburst of pure rage out of nowhere and it scared the hell out of me. He had a bunch of outburst one year taking his anger out on me and my mom for no reason. He finally stopped one day, but he was still manipulative. 

Another reason could be because I got help pretty early. When I was looking up things about ocd a lot of sites stress how important it is to go get help as soon as possible so it can be treated. I guess a lot of people with ocd don't get help for it because their ashamed and embarrassed making a possible form of mild ocd turn into a severe case that can't be cured. I saw the hypnotherapist relatively early on (3 months in when I was having the intrusive thoughts), so that could be why they went away so quickly. How long did you have those intrusive thoughts before your parents took you to go get professional help? 

Did you and your brother really have a relationship? Did the scapegoat and golden child role alternate between the two of you? Did you have any friends during your childhood? Did you spend a lot of time isolated from people? 

Lol I know I'm asking a bunch of questions, but I'm curious about this topic because it doesn't seem to be talked about often. Just and fyi I'm still pretty anxious even though I haven't been diagnosed I'm sure I have anxiety it's just not as bad as it used to be because I finally moved out and went NC with my family."
raisedbynarcissists,fmmdfw2,t1_fmmcdh3,1586203276.0,Tbh I can't even say narcissist because I'm not a clinical therapist. You can't either unless someone actually diagnosed your mother with NPD.

raisedbynarcissists,fmmcxrd,t1_fmmcdh3,1586203025.0,"But if your allowing the behavior your still just as guilty as the narcissist. I still don't get why you would say one is just an enabler and not a narcissist as well doesn't make any sense to me. 

I say the enabler is a vulnerable narcissist too because they could very well stop it they just dont want to for their own selfish reasons. Vulnerable narcissists aren't talked about as much as grandiose narcissists so I guess that's why they just get put in the enabler category. 

As someone that has been through it do not get it twisted. Your dad can stop her behavior he just doesnt want to. He's putting her well being and feelings above you. Someone can definitely be an enabler and a narcissist."
raisedbynarcissists,fmmbqnd,t1_fmm8j95,1586202418.0,"He's just as guilty as she is for allowing that behavior. I don't know your dad personally, but you should watch for his behavior because he may do the same things your mom. He just may be more slick about it."

I guess is because the other parent isn't seem as a narcissist because their the quiet one, but they are. Their just a vulnerable narcissist instead of the stereotypical grandiose type. They pretend like they don't like the drama and their just helpless when that's not the case at all."

I didn't define a HVW by the way she looks but by the way she carries herself which is why I included self esteem. Maybe I didn't make it clear in my post, but I don't define a HVW by their appearance completely. The reason I say completely is you do have to keep up your appearance to a certain extent whether you like it or not. Everyone men or women judge by looks. You can't walk around with your hair a complete mess though, so lets not pretend like you can walk around with your hair wild and crazy and be taken seriously. I never said you have to get your hair done by a professional and nails done ever week and have the ""perfect body"" what I was really trying to emphasize is the high self esteem part.

I never said getting your nails done and have a nice body is apart of being a HVM woman though. I was just bringing up what I hear a lot of men talk about what I was really empathizing"
FemaleDatingStrategy,fl0c33r,t1_fl0798s,1584700832.0,"Because that's how a lot of the previous generations of women were and they raised us to be this way.

Honestly, I never listened because it didn't make any sense and I finally felt like I wasn't crazy when I saw women speaking out about it online these past 3 years. 

My friend recently got told by an older man that she needs to learn how to clean and cook otherwise she won't find a man ( like women ever need a man), so it's definitely not just young men acting entitled and insane their that way because of the desperate baby boomers and generation xers coddling them and older men encouraging trash behavior."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fkyi94k,t1_fkygj8s,1584649263.0,"I'm not saying it's easy under societal pressures at all. I was raised when men and boys were put first. My family (like a lot of other families in the World) has the mindset that if you don't do cook and clean everyday like a slave your going to end up alone and depressed while being hard on the girls in the family. I quickly learned that yes people do want social vaildation, but you should not have to sacrifice your self worth in the process if you have to do that then it's not worth it because in the end your going to suffer.

I'm not at all trying to dismiss this issue because I just brought up how a lot of these other ""pro-women"" don't seem to have empathy for other women in another thread. 

I empathize with you, but if it is hard for you I suggest you work on your confidence and self esteem before you date because if you go in it with the mindset that,"" men are the prize"" men will definitely take advantage of you and society will blame you for his behavior. If you don't have access to therapy at the moment there's books and videos you can access. Once your self esteem becomes better and better you'll be able to differentiate the two. Having experienced it myself if they do sense weakness and they will take advantage of you and they don't feel bad about it either. Your welcome and have a good rest of your day."

Never said that. I said that having a codependent or toxic mother is more than likely going to produce a codependent child. That is not the child's fault AT ALL even if the child does turn into an adult. Now I know you were privileged just throwing around therapy because not everyone has access to therapy. You should know that, but yes if you have access to therapy that is a good way to start healing even though you will never 100% heal even if you are in there for a lifetime. 

I said if a child turns out codependent that is 100% the parental fault. The parents just dont get a pass when the kid turns 21 and they get to wipe their hands of the bs they caused. That's ridiculous thinking. I stand by my comment and facts backed by actually research that the way a parent raises their child affects their adulthood. No one said that this means that you can lash out at people that's why I specifically brought up codependency as an example though, but I feel like your going to keep twisting up my words and being dishonest and try to gaslight me. I'm not stupid."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fksek7n,t1_fks7qvn,1584488307.0,"Right. People with good childhoods always want to act like everyone had a good childhood and ignore those who didn't and play dumb.

The way your raised definitely affects your childhood and the people who downvoted my comment are more than likely extremely spoiled brats that have this,"" pull yourself up by your bootstraps."" mentality and constantly got handouts in life.

They always use the same lines. ""Well you cant stay mad forever."" ""Your parents did the best they could."" They just say those lines to silence you when you want to talk about how you were abused in your child because they could care less. 

I'm noticing a lot of these ""pro-women"" and ""feminist"" blaming and talking shit about women more than they do men instead of having empathy. I can see right through the bs. They talk and laugh at these women that go through a lot and put up with a lot to make themselves feel better.

 Yes a lot of women are giving advice in this subreddit, but it is important to know that a lot of women are still in competition with other women as well. The ones that laugh and write 5 paragraph essays on how they wouldn't allow some man to do x,y,z and like another woman did just want to keep the women's self esteem low, so that they have more options while bringing the women's self esteem to a even lower point than before. They really don't want the women with low self esteem to level up at all because if the women with low self esteem actually leveled up it would be more competition."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fkrvp2w,t1_fkrumke,1584476974.0,"I never even said that I'm blaming parents for what they do. Second of all if a parent did raise their kid to be codependent and reliant on someone that is 100% the parent's fault. Too many people constantly make excuses for shitty parents and want to give them a pass when their kids turn into adults. Your talking from a position of having a good mother figure. If you do not know what it's like to grow up with a toxic mother, so don't pretend like you even have a clue. It's so easy to say, "" Get over it"" when it's never happened to you. You never had to deal with the pain and stress of undoing a lot of self destructive behaviors caused by your own mother, so don't pretend like you understand or care. 

It's just common sense that if you grew up with a codependent, and or toxic mother 9 times out of 10 your going to have a lot of codependent behaviors and  guaranteed it's going to affect your adult life. This is actually proven not something I pulled out of the sky. People with a decent or good childhood always want to act like it's easy to get over childhood trauma.

You may not realize it, but you were way more fortunate than a whole lot of other girls growing up. Get some more empathy for other women instead of trying to insult them because not everyone has the same story as you."

A lot of other black women get defensive when this is said for some reason, but it's the truth. The majority of black men are violent if this wasnt the case we wouldn't be 35% more likely than white women to be assaulted. This issue definitely needs to be talked about it more."
