Because I have plenty of time now, I joined the groups and read the things. The Q groups are huge, and the posts are constant. JFK Jr is alive, every democrat and celebrity is a pedo, Pelosi and the Clintons run human trafficking rings, etc. Everything you see can be a symbol for evil: keys, pasta sauce, pizza. They are waiting on the arrest of Hillary Clinton, and they are sure it's going to happen. Trudeau is the son of Fidel Castro. Trudeau and Ellen are wearing ankle monitors. And The rest of us are idiots for not understanding their theories.
I'm not a fan of the Clintons, and I think politics is mostly a club I can't belong in. But I do not think Jesus was an alien and JFK Jr is alive and will run as Trump's VP."
