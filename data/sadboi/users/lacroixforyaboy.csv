depression,fpmqc73,t3_gea6mo,1588738983.0,"It is a strange realization, one that I understand, but that doesn't mean that there is no hope. We have to try to nourish our current friendsships and let ourselves be open to being vulnerable. It hurts if you're not seen, but what hurts even more is not putting any effort and seeing everyone else be happy. If we don't try, we will never succeed. Depression has a hold on a lot of us, but if we muster up the courage, we can be as happy as we assume others to be, especially those who we feel are great or rather 'best' friends. I don't know. Just my thoughts. I hope that helps even a bit."
