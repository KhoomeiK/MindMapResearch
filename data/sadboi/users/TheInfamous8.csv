malehairadvice,fnnsrgy,t1_fnnrgn3,1587100629.0,Awesome! Thank you
tressless,fanxi3a,t3_e8y0s0,1576252849.0,"Man, I feel the exact same way. As long as I can remember, it's been one of my biggret insecurities. Always had a shitty high hairline with shit texture. A nice hairline and good hair texture would frame my face so well(as it would to all of us) and I would have loved to have that feeling but no. My life already sucks outside of balding but if I didn't have this issue I think my life would be a lot more bearable and maybe even enjoyable. :("
depression,fag2go1,t1_fag13kh,1576038224.0,Thanks for the words of support.
depression,fag2g3s,t1_fag1h9d,1576038212.0,Yeah I feel the exact same way. Like I'm just getting older and things aren't getting better.
depression,f9bwllz,t3_e4b9k9,1575217015.0,It really does make it so much worse. I grew up with the bare minimum and even now I struggle a lot with my money.
amateur_boxing,f96ovqo,t1_f96mufc,1575149101.0,"Wow, you've been through a lot! Appreciate it!"
amateur_boxing,f96osnq,t1_f96m3b1,1575149039.0,It's a hand injury.
depression,f946qfh,t1_f946nv0,1575079000.0,"Yeah, it's a side problem to me too but it just makes everything much worse."
SuicideWatch,f60jlza,t1_f5zwr7j,1572618905.0,"Either jumping, gun, or OD"
SuicideWatch,ez9kslm,t3_d0d8p1,1567784483.0,Yeah this shit is so pointless and stupid to me
depression,eym0zmo,t3_cx1nlm,1567196792.0,Way too relatable. It maybe takes me like three seconds after open my eyes to become aware that I am awake and my heart will sink like you mentioned.
depression,eyg87hp,t3_cwt34b,1567063583.0,Sometimes I'll have a small glimmer of hope but it's usually short lived.
depression,ey5b1xj,t3_cvmbzg,1566827069.0,Yuuup. I just woke up not too long ago and I just want to go back to sleep already
depression,ey4mgsd,t3_cvj1tf,1566797707.0,Yup. I wouldn't say it's social anxiety in my case. I just don't have the energy to carry on convos with people and get to know people anymore. Whenever I'm out i try to avoid even the smallest interactions.
depression,ey4m4yz,t3_cvdz9i,1566797343.0,Totally feel this. I haaaate seeing myself in the mirror. It brings like a feeling of dread and sadness throughout my body when I do.
depression,ey4m30b,t3_cvds78,1566797282.0,Same. I slept the whole day away yesterday and my hobbies and interests are slowly finding their way out of my life. I don't see the point anymore.
depression,ey4lyut,t3_cvfcru,1566797156.0,Crazy how this describes me so much these past days. Like Ive really been drafting out a note in my head and I am closer to completing it every time. I also wish i could donate life. Like why did i have to be born when there is someone else who would have probably been a lot more grateful and happy with life than me.
depression,ey1xxz4,t1_ey1xags,1566715801.0,Yeah I could imagine I would be looked at with pity after that. But i know if i were to see somebody in that situation I would not judge them for it because i totally understand. I truly hope so too.
depression,ey1x2c8,t3_cv27k9,1566714790.0,"I have never opened up to anybody about my depression, but I remember I had a friend who once did and we as friends honestly treated him no differently  and i didn't see him any differently at all. Maybe cause i know what the pain is like and know how much it would suck to be judgeed for it."
depression,ey1wx6i,t3_cv525a,1566714631.0,So sorry to hear that. Sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pain. I can totally relate to you in some ways. Sometimes I have to stop myself from crying at work. Imagine explaining why you're crying to a coworker. I hope something good comes your way that can help alleviate the pain.
SuicideWatch,ey1w00u,t3_cv3c81,1566713539.0,Sure seems like it. And i am one of them.
depression,ey1pcf7,t3_cuytin,1566706437.0,Same here. I'm so tired of this
depression,exs4hhm,t3_cu1v7z,1566532053.0,Yeah laying in bed before going to sleep is the best. The worst is waking up and seeing sunlight.
SuicideWatch,exqjc4j,t3_ctz0mq,1566502975.0,For sure. I don't ever see myself getting married.
depression,ewaex6d,t3_cn5vlj,1565242288.0,This was me this morning and the past few mornings for a few months now :(. I wake up and think wow i really have to do this again can't i just sleep for eternity. I just think about how I'm gonna have to fake my way through the day and completely exhaust myself doing so :(.
depression,ew48wlo,t3_cmqeaf,1565105484.0,It really is. It's strange sometimes when I catch myself having even a vibrant personality but it all feels so fake because i can feel the sadness on the inside.
SuicideWatch,ew3cbjc,t3_cm8dm9,1565072151.0,Absolutely. It is definitely one of the main things that makes me extremely sad and suicidal. Some days I'll feel ok but once i look in the mirror itcompletely changes my mood.
SuicideWatch,ew38ked,t3_cm9566,1565067875.0,"Definitely me. I go out on dates. I go out with friends. I have hobbies that people think i love doing, but deep inside i feel hollow. :("
depression,evv1kp3,t3_ckyuve,1564814940.0,"For the most part, i usually feel better at night knowing that I'll be escaping reality for a bit through sleep."
depression,evax9jf,t1_ev8fjmx,1564359794.0,"Yeah sorry to hear that man. Hopefully you can find a dtyle that suits you well and makes you feel good. I go as often as once a week now because of the style of cut i get and how it makes me feel, but then I'll be right back to my depressive mood. Sometimes though those bouts of somewhat good feelings will give me hope."
depression,ev8brmx,t3_cil4ir,1564274900.0,Glad to hear that it helped you feel better! I certainly feel much better when i give my living space a good cleaning and when i get a haircut. But i can relate in that those feeling soon subside and i start to feel like crap again.
depression,ev85dal,t1_ev81mga,1564269715.0,"Yup, that feeling of worthlessenss is just horrible. Sorry to hear im in the same boat."
depression,ev859vd,t1_ev806ss,1564269641.0,Thanks for sharing. Same here. I totally feel like I'm almost faking every interaction even if it might seem like I'm having the tine of my life.
depression,ev856x9,t1_ev7z1sl,1564269582.0,Thank you for sharing. What do you mean your dad's normal reaction?
