Ditto on the mindfulness. I use to lie about eeeeverything, and I'm sure people knew it, because many of my lies were just outlandish (Britney Spears is my cousin, and I'm only 9, buy Daniel Radcliffe is my boyfriend. Oh, by the way, I made it on to American Idol, but my mom pulled me out.) 

I got older, and the lies became more realistic, but I also started making better friends and it just felt. . .wrong. I guess it kind of came to a head, and I decided to fess up to them that I had a problem with lying, and even bringing new people into my life, I let them know off the bat it was an issue of mine. After that, any time I caught myself lying, I'd laugh and announce, ""Scratch that, I'm lying,"" and it actually really worked for me and my circle. That mindfulness and accountability really changed the game.

I lie way less frequently, and most are little white lies. I do, however, put a lot of personality into my true to life stories, and omit the more boring parts when I'm trying to impress people, only I feel like a complete loser afterward because I'm literally making stories about toddler sized shits sound fascinating while other people have incredible stories about hobbies and careers and vacations.

Anyway, I agree with the other posters suggesting you tell your psychiatrist. If there is something going on that owning up to it would land you in the hospital, then you probably need it. Whether further treatment is necessary as a result or not, coming clean may be freeing, and it could be paramount in moving your progress forward. Best of luck to you,  OP."
