ptsd,fij80y1,t3_f84tig,1582437305.0,"I have the same emotionally-silent panic attacks. I have a theory because I read a lot. 

scientific information: here's a theory that when you have an early developmental trauma disorder (ex. cPTSD), the damage will sit in places that have not fully formed, in developmental faultlines. One place is the formation of the left/right brain split. The left brain being logical and the right brain emotional, right? Traumatized people don't have a well developed corpus collosum, which connects the logical and emotional parts of their brain, so they have VERY hard time calming themselves down, thinking clearly when they're upset. I used to think the bad parts of my day felt SO  far away from the good parts, I couldn't remember good times when I was bad and when I felt good I thought I was ""faking"" being sick. I could also shut off my emotions almost at will, like in an emergency or when programming. So I was living consciously in one brain while the other was shoved into a closet.

All this to say, you maybe are doing a really good job at turning the light off your emotions. It's much easier living in the rational brain when you're emotionally overwhelmed. However, you are still being affected by something. You still have an amygdala response. Hence the panic attacks. You just can't hear what they're saying."

When it's really bad I actually think nothing is real and am freaked out about it. Also depersonalization: my body doesn't feel like mine or it feels smaller than it is.
