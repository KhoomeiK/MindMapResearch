It took a bit for me to start trusting the system again after that and realizing that psychiatrists were people too.

Earlier in my mental health career I'd discovered that a ""prescriber"" (the word the clinic uses for nurse-practitioners-acting-as-psychiatrists) I was suppose to meet with was into tarot and similar shit. Luckily she got dumped. I've found that with the public mental health system it's a toss-up whether or not you're going to find someone worth their salt. I've been through a lot of different people and some of them are really shitty. I finally got a diagnosis after a couple years which is cool. Maybe keep pressing through and you'll find someone you click with. Otherwise you're not going to get a diagnosis.
