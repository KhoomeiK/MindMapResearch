I mean if I can get consistent gains weekly, small, but more likely, that is my end goal. Do you yourself have success with using iron condors for side income? 

Also, as I mentioned earlier, I also made a practice credit spread with 11/8 AMD selling a $35C and buying a $37C. Is the idea supposed to be that you make more money on collecting premium versus the loss from the call you bought?"

What are the types of situations where this trade would not be profitable?

Also, sorry what do you mean by IC?"
