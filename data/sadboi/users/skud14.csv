It can build the automated trucks to deliver the resources from the mines to the factories. The factories can create the machines to farm as well. The factories merely need instructions, which only one person needs to give.

A fully autonomous automated system may be 50 or 70 years away but it is the inevitable outcome of automation that a single individual would be able to fully sustain himself with such a system. Such a system is completely self contained.

Things like money and CEOs, shareholders and companies are meaningless when you can get your automated system to make whatever you want without having to pay anyone. The only difficulty is finding and securing resources, which is where conflict will occur between these powerful individuals."

Autonomous automated factories and machines will serve the whims of a single individual and he will be completely self sufficient because of it. His automated factories could make anything, mine anything, fight anything, repair anything, and he'd just have to sit back and enjoy the benefits.

Under such a future, community doesn't exist. A man who holds so much power, without needing to depend on human labour, is a man who has no purpose for a community. The largest his circle will get will be close family members and political allies, as he along with all those who have such automated set ups will be 1 man nations without having to devote resources to looking after tens of millions of other humans.

Unless you're a family member or a close friend, he has reason to let you live on his land. He has the power to evict you, and he has the reason to do so for resource acquisition.

Unless you yourself have an automated system. In which case it's war or treaties.

TL;DR: The automated future is a future of one man kingdoms with absolute godlike power at their fingertips, whilst displacing and crushing those who lack such systems, which will be the vast majority of mankind. These individuals will have no reason to let you live on their land unless they see a potential bonding partner in you.

In time this would eventually expand to single individuals having control over an entire planet whilst their family members spread out across other planets.

Edit: And the concept of a minimum and maximum wage were indeed enforced legal matters in certain countries (England for example in which this law, at least the maximum wage, was enforced by the King) so while its current rendition is modern, it is not a uniquely modern concept. Not to mention that Roman soldiers of antiquity also had a minimum wage (in salt), making the idea even older.

As to first statement about comparing it to medieval Earth; aside from the fact regardless of which planet or universe we're in, a medieval aged civilization is still going to have the same things impacting it that lead to medieval kingdoms on Earth to value things in such a different way, making such comparisons *universal*, but even if you didn't accept such a concept, the value of things to be identical to modern Earth is absurd.

No matter what world we're in, there ought to be a difference in how x is valued above or below x purely down to it being a different planet with different historical events, things like magic and differences in resource rarity.

In short, even if one were to say that the value should be ordered nothing like that of medieval Earth, it should still not be ordered anything like that of modern Earth."

Or to compare it to medieval standards; while we can be sure that bread will remain lower than rent across each country in a modern world, in a medieval world, rent was generally cheaper than food, while food itself was still much cheaper than it is now, with a pair of boots costing someone a years worth of pay.

Additionally the things that made the value of things worth x in the medieval ages are still present in the fantasy world.

The minimum wage of a medieval worker had far superior purchasing lose than the minimum wage of today, at least in terms of basic necessities. Whereas min wage of a modern worker is higher than the richest of merchants in the medieval ages in terms of non essential purchasing power.

The point is that these things are so vastly separated from each other than it has no place to be mentioned.

The purchasing power of a fictional currency does not need to be compared to a real world currency to establish what it can and cannot purchase, and in fact attempting to make such comparisons only serves to make the story less coherent as time goes on. What things are worth today is not what they will be worth in say 20 years from now, and the currency itself is a fluctuating thing. Making a reader from 20 years from now perhaps very perplexed."
