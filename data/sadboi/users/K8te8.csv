I've planned it out for yrs but somehow I'm still here. Suicide is like an obsession because it's option 2. I recommend motivational speeches, journaling, and therapy. Also music and art gets my hurt out. Hope u find relief."
depression,ezmzssj,t1_ez5lr03,1567999035.0,Same here. I confide in people I think will be my friends then they drop me and don't talk to me anymore. Feel like it's better to re!ain quiet and don't talk. People constantly dismisses mental health which only intensifies the symptoms. People are  cruel.
