depression,feif99m,t3_epbkth,1579137154.0,"Somehow I have a boyfriend, we've been together for over a year and he accepts me for who I am. I've always been very open about my depression and he has been very supportive. He understands that sometimes I'm not myself and can be really hurtful, at times it can be really challenging but we have been through some very rough patches and made it to better times.

I haven't made friends for 3 years because of depression and social anxiety, my bf just got attracted to me because we were both loners. I'm still trying to overcome my depression and anxiety and I've finally started socialising more. I think I've even made a few new friends.

I think, the best way to overcome depression is to reach out to the right people, I think some depressions are just caused by boredom and/or loneliness. If you make meaningful connections you can feel better, I can't promise depression will go away but life can certainly be better if you share some love <3

I've had so many painfully awkward interactions with people, embarrassing moments, bullying, transferred colleges 3x etc just to get to where I am now. To finally make some friends. It doesn't happen without trying. Sometimes you're just in the wrong environment. 

Keep trying and things will work out. Yes you will be rejected, yes you will be hurt BUT you learn from these experiences."

depression,f25jixt,t3_dc2fvt,1569976140.0,"You know I read somewhere that sometimes when you stare at words for a long time it starts to not look like that word anymore. Or when you say a word a hundred times it stops sounding like a word and just a sound. What if when you stare at the mirror or photos of yourself so long you just begin to distort yourself?

Another thing is, there's more to life than how your face or body looks or voice sounds. There are things you can do in life to make yourself and others feel good.

Also, you probably don't look as bad as you think. I used to think of myself as ugly. I hated photos of myself and looking at the mirror. I felt sick. People would always take horrible photos of me and some people still do. It always made me feel bad. Then, one day, I met someone and they really liked me and wanted photos of me. I always refused but eventually I let them.

And... To my surprise... I looked good in the photo. All along everyone else was just bad at photographing or had a shitty phone.

Did you know that phone cameras greatly distort the face? That's why you often look different in a mirror. Google phone camera lens distortion comparisons and you'll see just how much a face shape can change depending on the lense. It's crazy.

And if after reading this doesn't help. Then maybe consider learning how to use makeup and experiment. Have fun. You'll figure it out like I did =)

Edit: I still don't like photos being taken of me but I feel better about myself knowing sometimes phones or people suck. So at the end of the day, how you look in a photo doesn't matter. What matters is how you feel about yourself and if you can let go a bad photo."

And using illness to control the youth is so messed up. A while ago I told my mum I want a tattoo and she implied to wait until my grandparents pass away so they will not be here to condemn me.

A few years ago I was really sick and was in and out of hospital for over a year and she kept lying that I was healthy. And then when I came to visit my grandparents they didn't recognise me because of how ill I had become. Boom. Trust issues since then.

But the thing is I'm not gonna be able to hide it from my grandparents, since they have no concept of privacy, mostly my grandma though. I'm not hiding because I'm afraid of their opinion, frankly I don't really give a shit, I'm more worried that they are very old and stuff like this could be horrible for their health.

relationship_advice,eyqlo7q,t3_cyaaxe,1567347062.0,"It sounds like she may be hiding something and feels really paranoid about her privacy being invaded. Or she could be having some trust issues?

Me and my partner are really open with our devices, we gave ecah other our phone passwords mostly for safety reasons. Like if I'm in a an emergency situation and my phone is dead and his works then I will be able to use his device.

Mostly we share each others phones to look at pictures we've taken, we have taken so many it's a bit silly to send all 800 when we can just swap phones to look at them. Sometimes I just use my bfs phone to call my phone when I've lost it too.

I think it's unusual your partner is so defensive of her device, I know some people who are extremely private with their devices but even they don't react in such a way as your partner, accussing you of touching their stuff.

You should talk to her and ask why this is such a big deal for her. Maybe you feels like she doesn't trust you?"
