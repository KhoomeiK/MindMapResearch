I know the struggle when it comes to do the perfect eye cat liner but really, it turned out great! Also, youâ€™re incredibly beautiful, oh my! Hope to see your posts more often honestly ðŸ§¡"

Iâ€™m so so so incredibly happy for you, I wish you all the best, I really wish you a happy and quiet and safe life. And I also hope youâ€™ll remember this feeling of happiness if (letâ€™s hope this never happen again though) things might get a bit rough again.

Iâ€™ve struggled a lot with my depression and anxiety and have been suicidal for years, was even hospitalized for some time, but dear, itâ€™s possible to come out of it with more self consciousness and Iâ€™m just so happy to hear youâ€™re at this point. Well done, so proud of you for going through everything you had to face.

Once again, I hope just the very best for you. Congrats ðŸ–¤"
