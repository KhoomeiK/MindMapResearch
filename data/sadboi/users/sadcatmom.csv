I only have 3 Neopets (technically 4, a grarrl I am waiting to pound after getting lent BGC) A baby chomby I adopted a loooooooooong time ago from someone, a pirate Kougra I also adopted a long time ago, and a Tyrannian Kougra that I made/painted myself. I've always been so bad at making neopoints, so I've never really painted anything expensive lmao."

Hi! I donâ€™t really have any type of great reason to deserve a gift, but it would be incredibly appreciated! I recently got back into Neopets to give me something to motivate myself during the day, as silly as that sounds. Iâ€™ve had depression for several years and it can be hard to find a reason to get up in the morning. For some reason, Neopets is filling the void right now. I would paint the first Neopet I created on my current account into a baby Kougra. Heâ€™s almost 12 years old. :D"

""We do not, and never have, adjust  game scores. If a score doesn't  process for whatever reason, you just  have to try again. Sorry about  that.

We  have thousands of scores coming in a day we can't be  looking into each  one or the meepits would just run a amok while we  looked away."""
