If it follows, then put it in the form of premises with a conclusion.  Notice how William Lane Craig hides his assertion at the end.  After he's stated the universe had a cause, he does his one-sentence-assertions about what he thinks must have caused the universe.  His assertions if placed into a formal argument would never stand up to scrutiny.  Imagine if I said ""Nothing is spaceless since it takes up no space, timeless since it exists at no point in time, and immaterial since you can't touch it.  Therefore, the spaceless, timeless, immaterial thing that William Lane Craig is talking about is nothing!  I pwooved it guys!  Nothing created the universe!!"".

DebateAnAtheist,fpwnm8n,t3_gfxlsz,1588966624.0,"Firstly, I appreciate you defining your terms.  That helps.

&#x200B;

> This actualization of potential can only be due to some other actuality(principle of causation.) 

I would reject this premise as unsupported.  I can give an example of a situation in which something actualizes a potential to be something else all by itself.  Suppose there's a planet called earth with an acorn on it and a star called sol.  The thing is a solar system called 'sol"" and it contains an acorn, yet it also contains everything necessary for that acorn to become a tree.  So the sol system as it is can actualize it's own potential to be something different than what it was.

&#x200B;

Now, we should stop there, as just a single problem tosses the whole thing out, but continuing on as if you resolved that problem:

> This principle of causation must be already actual(underived) or it must itself go from potential to actual in order to actualize another(derived.) 

I find this to be unsupported as well.

&#x200B;

 

>But an infinite hierarchical series of actualizers is impossible.

I find this premise also unsupported.  


 

>Therefore there must be a being who's very reason for existence is within its own essence and that derives its actuality from no other, an unactualized actualizer, and this is properly understood to be God.

There is absolutely ZERO reason to start talking about ""beings"" here.  The first mention of a being in your argument and it's in the conclusion?  The idea that a being of any kind must be involved is unsupported.  

Also, you offered no reason why  this 'being' is an exception to the proposed rules you would have the whole universe follow.  I mean, every acorn requires something else that exists first to become a tree, and every universe requires something else that already is what is... but the being doesn't?  That seems like some kind of special pleading logical fallacy, or rather it would be if you had actually pleaded he's a special exception.  As it stands, your conclusion just does not follow from your premises and your premises have not been demonstrated to be true anyway.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------------------- "" **THAT GOD IS ONE:** ""

> Whatever has an essence distinct from its existence must be caused or actualized from another. 

Unsupported.

> But the unactualized actualizer is not actualized. 

If it's unactualized, then it's not actual.  If it's not actual, by your definitions it isn't anything.  So this premise argues that nothing did something, which I don't think is your intention.  But also, it's unsupported.

&#x200B;

> Therefore, the unactualized actualizer must have an essence which just is existence: what it is *is* actuality simply put. 

By your definitions, this would mean the property in question is just whether or not something exists.  It wouldn't be a thing, or a being, just a property of things that exist.  Like the shape of a beach-ball is a property of a beach ball, but it's nothing more than a concept used to describe things which actually do exist.

&#x200B;

 

>What is composite must be actualized by another.

Again, rejected as unsupported.

&#x200B;

 

>Therefore the unactualized actualizer is absolutely simple, or not composed of parts in any respect.

Even if I grant all your premises in this second argument, this does not logically follow from your premises.  I think I know where you intended to go, based on you mentioning an infinite regression in the 1st argument, but you didn't form the argument in a way that goes that direction here.  As such, this argument isn't just unsound from unsupported premises, it's also invalid because this part does not logically follow.

&#x200B;

> If we posit that there would be two substances whose essence is existence then they would need something to distinguish each substance from each other. 

This is the first mention of ""substances"".  No substance could be existence.  A substance could have the property of existence, and we would just express that by saying the substance in question exists, but you could not have a substance that IS existence.  The words ""two substances whose essence is existence"" is a sequence of words that means nothing.  


> But nothing can distinguish one absolutely simple being from another. 

This is the first mention of ""beings"" in the 2nd argument.  No setup indicated any beings at all.  And while you didn't explicitly define what you meant by 'simple', from the context of the only other place you used this word (premise 5) it seemed to be that you meant 'not composed of parts"".  As such, it would logically be possible to distinguish two things not composed of any parts.  

Like imagine some vibrating string of energy is not composed of anything.  That makes it simple.  Imagine there are many such little strings, some on Earth, and some on Mars.  Perhaps arrangements of these strings creates all the rest of the matter and energy, but they themselves are not composed of strings, they just are strings.  Those strings would still have properties like where they are in the arrangement of something, what planet they are on, or really any other property.  They just aren't composed of smaller things.  I'm no expert on string-theory, and I don't mean to misrepresent that field of study, but I'm just trying to point out that ""not a composite of parts"" in no way indicates ""without any properties except maybe one"".

The main reason to play LOTRO for a lot of people is the lore.  It's middle-earth.  They put a lot of effort into having a lore basis for things.  If you're a big fan of LOTR lore, you'll notice many times that a very obscure detail is referenced by NPCs in the world or a bit of history few know is built upon for the history of a town or character.  


The end-game is honestly the best I've seen in many many years.  It's just such a f'ing blast.   
 The reward-scheduling, for lack of a better term, is fantastic right now.  I really really like how end-game is right now.  Something for everyone of all playstyles.  

That being said, level 130 is a long way off for you.  So unless you're dropping money on a level 120 level boost (which many would advise against for your first time going through the game because you miss so much content), you won't be seeing the current end-game for a while.  By the time you get there, we'll surely have moved on to new things, and hopefully the new things will also be great!  


For PVMP, if you are excited about that, research your server well.  I had a lot of fun on Laurelin back in the day with 40 person groups raiding other 40 person groups in castles in the open world.  So unique and cool!  but these days, I don't see much action in PvMP.  I'm on the roleplay server, and a lot of the PvMP community has moved to other servers to play so that there's always action.  These days, I felt lucky to see 8 creeps vs 11 freeps in the ettenmoors last night.  Nothing like it used to be on this server.  But other servers have more action.  So your server choice matters a lot with regards to PvMP.  
Also note, the PvMP is most often not well balanced.  It's kind of a side-game in the dev's eyes.  Not well supported.  So if you get beat in a 1vs1 fight out there, don't assume you suck or whatever, it's honestly probably that it was just not as even of a fight as it looked like!

Anyway, I'm having an absolute blast in Lotro right now.  Absolute f'ing blast.

Not for good reasons.  When you stare at the sun, an after-image of the sun can appear in your vision due to the damage.  If that's all that happened, it would explain why not everyone saw the sun dance around when they moved their head, explain why the picture of the sun showed nothing out of the ordinary, and explain why the rest of the planet did not notice the sun dancing around in the sky.  

If there was a god who could make the sun dance around, and it was capable of understanding humans, we could communicate with it by asking it to bounce the sun around once for yes, and twice for no... or something along those lines.  Then we could ask it stuff like, ""Should people be catholic?"" and video tape the results.  Instead we're left with unverifiable reports from people who were on a religious pilgrimage, so it's not worth much.

I think the OP's point is that if a group of people were convinced of a miracle after they stared at the stun or tripped on mushrooms today,  they would pull out their cell-phone cameras and confirm nothing out of the ordinary was going on.

It could be a time-traveler for all you know, or they could have gotten lucky or found out by some other means.
2. The Quran has inaccurate predictions.  Like it says the Earth is shaped like an ostrich egg for example.  There were plenty of objects known to the people of the time that the shape of the Earth could have been compared to, and the author(s) did not do so.  In another example, the amount of time it took for the 'heavens and the Earth' to form was 6 days.  This number turns out to be wrong by quite a lot!
3. Muslims tend to re-imagine inaccurate predictions as being accurate ones.  Or ""True from a certain point of view"" after a more reliable method like science has demonstrated conclusively that the Quran must be wrong.  So muslims will believe the Sun orbits the Earth because the Quran pretty clearly refers to the Sun orbiting with the moon, but then when geocentrism is disproven they'll switch the meaning to say that the Quran actually meant to say the Sun orbits the center of a galaxy and that just all the muslims who read it as orbiting the Earth were merely reading it wrong.

So a malfunctioning or drugged up brain subjectively *feels* like it's experiencing a lot to that brain sometimes... but where's the strong evidence for ""Idealism is the metaphysical position that consciousness is the ontological ground of existence. "".

I mean, people tripping on magic mushrooms don't seem to describe our shared reality accurately.  They don't seem to gain any verifiable information.  Worse, they often believe they have information which is verifiably inaccurate.  

I don't really care if you tell me that it felt like you floated above your body when you almost died.  I want you to accurately tell me whether there's any frisbee's up there so I can send the janitor up to get one for me.

Additionally, you have exposed no contradiction.

I think there's more than one problem here.

1. The first premise is unsupported.  I have no idea how you could ever demonstrate that nothing, including things we haven't discovered yet, could ever move themselves.  But so far, I have not seen it demonstrated that such a thing is impossible.  What if there was some kind of god that could move itself?  Then the first premise would be false.  As it stands, the premise is unsupported.
2. The second premise doesn't follow from the first premise even if the first premise is true.  Something could have always been moving for all we know.  There could be a god not moved by something else.  How would you demonstrate that everything, including things we don't know exist, have been moved by something else if they are moving?
3. The third premise has a good attempt at an explanation for support, but I do not find it convincing.  I don't think you've successfully demonstrated that the cosmos has always expanded and will always expand, nor that it couldn't have been smaller and smaller in the past.  You're making a logical argument, but for all you know there will be a big crunch and the universe will shrink in the future.  For all you know, when the universe was small enough, such as around one plank time after the big bang, things could have been very different.  Perhaps the universe is infinitely divisible, and perhaps there actually is a time before Big Bang and we simply don't have the ability to examine it.  At best, I think you can get us to, ""Those things are not currently predicted by what we know"".  You haven't got us to ""Those things are impossible, therefore we know this other thing.""
4. Speaking of that other thing.  Even if I grant all your premises, it doesn't get us closer to a god.  All it tells us is that IF there was a god, it would have to be put in motion by something else.  And that is only if I grant all the premises, which I don't."
