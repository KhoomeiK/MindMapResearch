Tried friends too many times. I thought someone was my friend but they didn’t seem to care for me."
communism101,f7xtfaw,t3_dx8qyh,1574074554.0,"Anarchism has nothing to do with Marxism. I was an anarchist myself and i began understanding more about Marxism. They have a different definition of socialism and many believe that socialism cannot have a state. Some believe it can but they borrow arguments from leftcoms against Marxism-Leninism. Re-Education did make a terrible video on vanguardism and someone MLs did a [response video](https://youtu.be/q26i1hO0mgQ) to him.

When i was anarchist, i remember people just looking for any biased source to express their hatred of the USSR, Stalin, Lenin or any other socialist state. So they end up spreading anti-communist propaganda.
They love equating the bourgeois state to a proletariat one. I tried to get some of my friends to understand but their understanding of the state, comes from liberalism.
They’re more interested in moral arguments and ones that represent the individual. They focus more on hierarchy than they do class, so this cannot be anything like Marxism."

People get so scared of trying to not be authoritarian because western media likes to paint any country it hates as authoritarian. Western mindset is about liberty and freedom, which they aren’t actually in favour of. It’s just propaganda."
