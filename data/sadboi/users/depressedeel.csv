You should not be expected to pay for their education. If anyone, the parents should be. This'll sound harsh, but if they couldn't afford to have that many kids and keep them afloat, they shouldn't have had that many.

While other holidays are 'friends and family appreciation' in a way, your birthday is 'you' appreciation day. In my eyes, it's a lovely opportunity for people to show you how much they care, by spending time with you, having fun, and maybe buying you something that shows they really know you. 

And...it sucks. 

We see all the happy people in movies, TV, social media, or even celebrate our friends birthdays - and we think it's fun to see this person you love and care about so happy!

And you aren't. 
And it sucks. 
Not to make it about me, but mine sucked too. I wanted so desperately for people to remember and to show they REALLY cared. And they didn't. Instead, I was the bad guy for wanting people with me. I'm not kidding, I basically lost a friend because I (indirectly) said how upset I was that no one came over, no one got me anything, and how most people couldn't even say two words that are ultimately meaningless. 

I'm so so sorry you didn't have a good birthday. I really, really mean it. If you're interested at all, I promise I'm not scamming, I'll buy you something off Amazon and send it to you.

And I couldn't tell you. Probably the trope of they all look the same? I've heard that said about Americans too though, from native Asians visiting the West.

SuicideWatch,etxrjvf,t3_ce08j2,1563305786.0,"Man, that sounds awful. If I was divorced I would have killed myself right after it happened. You're strong to have made it any amount of time after that. Good luck in whatever route you take!"
SuicideWatch,etxrf1h,t3_cduvdm,1563305700.0,"That's true. If you're alive, there's so many bad things to upset you and depress you to no return. My dreams as well have been less than desirable, and you have no way of controlling them! At least when you're dead, no one can disappoint you."
