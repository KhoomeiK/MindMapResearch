SWGalaxyOfHeroes,fr0733c,t1_fqv6i67,1589785746.0,I went with Sith Marauder on my sith empire team until I unlocked Malak and it worked out pretty good. He's easy to gear up too

Anxiety,filqqhs,t1_ficnn38,1582508038.0,I actually did a quick search of therapists in my area and found one that caught my eye. I will call her tomorrow for sure. What's the worst that can happen right?
Anxiety,filqnfp,t1_ficnn38,1582507978.0,"As a matter of fact I started using the calendar app on my tablet and it does help me get certain things done.

SWGalaxyOfHeroes,fbzpe6c,t1_fbxjnik,1577255086.0,My CLS squad got destroyed lol. But I took out his jedi revan with mine easily. His jedi revan was only g10 with g12 GMY and g10 jolee. Didn't stand a chance against my g13 relic 4 revan and g13 relic 5 Yoda lol
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,fbxhjcu,t1_fbxd0v1,1577187778.0,His DR is g13 relic 3 and his speed is like 317 lol. I think my only shot to take down his DR squad would be my jedi revan squad or maybe cls han and chewie. but who could I use to take down his jedi revan squad? his jedi revan is g11 i think

SWGalaxyOfHeroes,fbx69eo,t3_eewmdl,1577171167.0,"Are there any squads that can take out a DR squad in 3v3 GAC that aren't meta? No darth Malak but the squad is DR, badstilla and sith empire trooper. I have a decent jedi revan squad but don't have DR yet.

GalaxyS7,f8d8g9p,t1_f89d4h3,1574481497.0,How much bigger are the batteries in the S10 and S10+? My screen broke on my S7 last month when I dropped it on a gravel parking lot.

GalaxyS7,f28xcc9,t1_f26b1g0,1570073270.0,Oh ok I know what you mean. I know there's some kind of process involved when they assemble the phone to make the water proof or water resistant seal.
GalaxyS7,f266oes,t1_f24jygd,1569995690.0,Do you only have to take the back glass off for just a battery replacement? I've worked on iphones but I've heard Galaxies are tougher because of the glass on the front and back.
GalaxyS7,f266mc0,t1_f254phr,1569995616.0,"So basically if you open up any kind of phone for repair and it's water proof and/or water resistant, there's no way to get that original water repellant back on the phone?"

Is this pop fake? It has a generic ""Special Edition"" sticker on the front. On the funko app it has a Rhode Island Comic Con sticker on the front. It looks genuine other than that though. Does that mean it's fake for sure?"
