And let's not forget, most people are not counselors or therapists. I know I sound like a broken record sometimes and I don't always put myself in the other person's shoes when I am spiraling down. Looking back, it feels pretty selfish."

Small victories can lift your spirit slightly, and hopefully you can gain momentum after a few of them. You may fail, but it's about trying again and again. Feeling powerless and not being able to help yourself is normal, and comfortable, but you have to do something to change that empty feeling within yourself."

mentalhealth,fnm3c3s,t3_g2ktte,1587064367.0,"I get it, I really do. You feel like everytime there was a fork in the road, you chose the wrong path. It's hard to find the positives of the decisions you made, even though when you made the decisions you felt like you made the best one with the information at hand.

You feel like you're trapped to be this person, because it's so easy to be that person. You fall back into you 'normal' self, your old sayings/routines/habits. Then you realize that your 'normal' self isn't who you want to be at all. You have to break away from who you think you are in order to be someone you want to be. That means saying things you don't normally say, doing things you don't normally do"

depression,fnldev7,t3_g2gy60,1587051586.0,"Hi

I think that you also need to find a hobby, something that takes up a regular time slot. I've tried meditation (didn't stick with it last time), and I'm going to start doing it again. It gives me a 10 min break in the morning to try my hardest to think of nothing at all. My mind is out of my control all day and I feel lost within my own head, crazy sometimes, and I need a break where I can just stop feeling. You need to also discuss this with your SO, it is important that they are involved and understand what you are going through as well."
mentalhealth,fni876r,t3_g1q7tk,1586975625.0,"I can relate to what you've written here very well.

The concept of CBT is attractive to me, and I've had several sessions with a therapist to work on techniques (such as the one you mentioned), but they don't seem to work as the **belief** is not present.

Alternatively, I also turned to Christianity in order to try to minimize my personal problems and look at the larger picture of humanity as a whole. I think there are good intentions and messages within Christianity, but I struggled with devotion because the **belief** was not present, and I felt fake in my words and prayers.

Frustration and helplessness to try and fix your own mind (who seems to be working against you) is something I can relate to."
