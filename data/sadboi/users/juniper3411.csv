productivity,foe54em,t3_g6u0q8,1587696213.0,I love EverNote.  I use it for a ton of different things.  I just downloaded the Streaks app and hoping this helps motivate me to consistently do certain things that I have been really struggling with.
bipolar,fo0iz1q,t3_g4g2jb,1587413989.0,Cute kitchen by the way!  Also great job :)
ADHD,fn1of1y,t3_fyrkfx,1586566417.0,I think I‚Äôve finally managed this whole routine thing. It‚Äôs only been a couple of weeks though.
bipolar,flfvct8,t3_fokkyt,1585119235.0,Had a great night with the kiddos. Family meal and good conversation and we made a fort and told scary stories :). Need to go to bed but otherwise I think it‚Äôs going to be a good Wednesday!  Also kitchen and bathroom renovation finally done and I got loads of stuff done
bipolar,flap4cc,t3_fnc2ub,1584988303.0,I feel like I am cycling faster then usual because of all of the outside stress.  Can't seem to get a handle on emotions or sleep.  I sleep 14+ hours last night but the two nights before I only slept like 3.  It has been all over the place.  I'm almost afraid to become hypo or manic because what the hell am I going to do stuck in the house?  Torture my family most likely.  Or power clean.
ADHD,flao9mp,t3_fnol7s,1584987813.0,Some very good tips!  I am of course drawing a blank on anything helpful to add at the moment but still wanted to say thanks :)
bipolar,flangmj,t3_fnnev3,1584987349.0,Staying connected remotely to people is definitely important!  And keep coming on here to chat with others for sure.  I am alternately handling it pretty well and then going off on the depression rails.  So I feel ya.
bipolar,flan687,t3_fndcwe,1584987184.0,I want to get back in to painting!  I'm not good at it either but if it makes you happy go for it!!  I only do abstract things anyway so there is that.  Wonder what places I can still order that stuff from while on quarantine?
bipolar,fl3jc3e,t3_fm8y15,1584786680.0,So perfect!
bipolar,fl3j51g,t3_fmcxpq,1584786418.0,Also your kitty is beyond adorable
bipolar,fl3j3zz,t3_fmcxpq,1584786379.0,My kitty also drools a lot when happy!  It‚Äôs gross but also adorable üòç. Also I feel ya. I took extra adhd meds too late like an idiot and now can‚Äôt sleep. Oops.
BipolarReddit,fl3divm,t1_fl211ez,1584778875.0,Haha I manage. Mostly üòù
bipolar,fl124xu,t1_fkticrg,1584720514.0,Sooooo true
BipolarReddit,fl122k8,t1_fkv5kxu,1584720477.0,Very likely. I‚Äôve had 5 total. 2 major and 3 minor.
BipolarReddit,fktzi85,t3_fkjk0t,1584538787.0,Also repeated head trauma can bring it out as well.  I've had childhood trauma and repeated head trauma.  So fun stuff.
bipolar,fktf1g3,t1_fktccwa,1584516910.0,I hope so ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
bipolar,fktc9yl,t1_fktbzen,1584513630.0,I‚Äôm kinda old and literally only know hybrid theory and Meteora lol
bipolar,fktbwxw,t3_fkktcu,1584513218.0,Also forgot how much I love their follow up album. Seriously!!!!
bipolar,fktbu9t,t1_fktbsfl,1584513135.0,I feel you. Seriously though!!
CPTSD,fkt7mei,t3_fkgz2r,1584508757.0,Basically the hurt you feel inside showing on the outside and the resulting validation.  I totally get it.  Trying to think what mine is though fairly certain it is similar in many respects to what you just wrote.
EDAnonymous,fkt7asm,t1_fkrgmch,1584508459.0,"Not sure if that was a turn of phrase or if you also suffer from bipolar but if it is the latter I feel your pain.  I've got Bipolar 1, ADHD and an eating disorder.  So fun stuff...."
EDAnonymous,fkt77sx,t3_fk6x6x,1584508382.0,Uh oh.  He's about to find out just how anal retentive us ED'ers can be!
EDAnonymous,fkt3n48,t3_fkcf3e,1584505328.0,Duuuuuude I feel ya. Well except for the school part haven't been there for a while but still the sentiment remains the same.
bipolar,fki7nqu,t1_fk50ffd,1584213570.0,Had that one last night.  The using it as an excuse to drink.  I've been at a pretty low point recently and it is not getting any better.  I know I need to get it in check but damn is it difficult when you are miserable and acutely depressed.
bipolar,fki6zz6,t1_fk4ug6q,1584213155.0,I think the combo of my ADHD and the bipolar make me overshare and talk about anything and everything way too much which includes talking about my illness since its s on the forefront of my mind a lot.
bipolar,fkh62pa,t3_fhpum2,1584189862.0,"I'm stressing out because I am in the middle of a kitchen and bathroom renovation and my kitchen is barely functional and we haven't gone to the grocery store in ages.   But I have anxiety about going to the store because people are nuts.  So if a quarantine happens and I don't have access to food and toilet paper it's going to be a bit of an issue....

I think my husband is going to brave the store today.  He better not put it off any longer though,..."
bipolar,fkh570b,t1_fkdvq0l,1584188989.0,"I think out loud all the time.  I also journal.  That helps if you need to think out loud but not actually ""be"" loud haha."
bipolar,fkh525z,t1_fkdwdo2,1584188847.0,Very accurate!
bipolar,fkh4vwa,t3_figcqt,1584188662.0,Do you wake up for a while in between or just for like five or ten minutes?  I wake up often during the night but not for very long.  But it is still extremely disruptive.
bipolar,fkgz8vy,t3_fibdrh,1584181677.0,I feel this to my very core. Also great doodle!!!
bipolar,fjmwd8a,t3_fe6kvu,1583487280.0,Word vomit and substance abuse offender here. I feel ya
bipolar,fjmw87l,t3_fe7pah,1583487073.0,Definitely not alone. Super overwhelmed myself. Sending mad internet love and hugs right now!!!
bipolar,fjmw406,t3_fe9f7s,1583486904.0,Same here. I‚Äôm sitting in the dark listening to music that makes me cry feeling on edge as well. But I will make it through this as will you. We are here for you ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
bipolar,fiuglmj,t1_fir2sfq,1582741012.0,Me too. Fun stuff
bipolar,fi6ycye,t1_fhbmz3q,1582210329.0,I think it works for me because of my co morbid adhd
bipolar,fhblc1x,t1_fhbh71n,1581444636.0,That is true. But they can always try and see.
bipolar,fhb723d,t3_f24vus,1581436181.0,Wellbutrin doesn‚Äôt make you gain and can sometimes make you lose weight
bipolar,fhb6kwi,t1_fhb5c1i,1581435891.0,I feel the same!  Keep up the fight!
BipolarReddit,fgvy9es,t3_f0a4p2,1581154500.0,Every day it‚Äôs a different dilemma sleep wise. Even worse is we all know less sleep equals manic trigger.  What really sucks is when your work plus crappy bladder triggers it and there is nothing you can do about it :(
bipolar,fgssy31,t1_fgpuxt1,1581091995.0,I‚Äôm the same way. Though I‚Äôm pretty satisfied now that my new hubby has the same high libido I do. But we are both down for open and have already implemented it lol
bipolar,fgsq394,t1_fgr7zpt,1581090232.0,Uh oh :(. Yeah I‚Äôm paying a lot in alimony and child support to my ex cause we made the state the time good decision for him to stay home with the kids. My current husband is making decent money and he‚Äôs a lot younger then me and on the up and up so I‚Äôm looking forward to that!
bipolar,fgpxhz4,t1_fgkqcko,1581013892.0,I don‚Äôt have a ton of depressive episodes either.  When I do they are usually mixed episodes. There is always a component of mania with me sadly lol
bipolar,fgpxcdu,t1_fgloijj,1581013807.0,Aw man I feel ya. I used to have a good credit score but my divorce ruined it
EDAnonymous,fgka1tz,t1_fgka0jt,1580860765.0,We will!  Just got to keep pressing on
EDAnonymous,fgk9l19,t1_fgk0y45,1580860467.0,It definitely isn‚Äôt. And I have freaking bipolar and adhd to really make things entertaining
EDAnonymous,fgjzsyi,t1_fgjzod3,1580854610.0,Ive been in this particular one for a while now.  Though technically I haven't been weighing myself because I'm too scared.
EDAnonymous,fgjzfyl,t3_eyw42x,1580854411.0,I haaaaaate this cycle.  It SUCKS
bipolar,fgjzbob,t1_fgh7pwk,1580854346.0,Haha you sound like me.  But yeah with the no impulse control things that make appetite go up are a nightmare.  I also found that Wellbutrin was weight neutral even possibly helped lose weight.
bipolar,fgjz5ns,t1_fgekmts,1580854252.0,"I'll have to check this sub out, thanks for sharing!"
bipolar,fgjz3zs,t1_fgejybv,1580854226.0,You don't have to be underweight to have an eating disorder!  This is a very very common misconception.  I would seriously consider getting evaluated for that.  I haven't been formally diagnosed with one but I know I have it.  I've been all over the board weight wise but two of the times was an aftermath of pregnancy.
bipolar,fgjyzj2,t3_ey0gm2,1580854156.0,Main reason I haven't gone on any meds yet.  I am going to work with my PCP to see if I can go back on Wellbutrin but with my eating disordered behavior just the anxiety and fear of gaining weight makes me far too worried to try any of the anti psychotics.
bipolar,fgjyqjv,t1_fggnli4,1580854017.0,I use EverNote for all of my lists.  I love it :)
bipolar,fgjyny8,t1_fgfddvw,1580853977.0,My husband makes fun of me for my obsessive love of list making haha.  And yeah...I don't get nearly enough things on said lists done either.
bipolar,fgjyf1s,t3_exvpvx,1580853837.0,"I get this cause of the ADHD as well.  And yeah, I hate that feeling.  And then you just don't end up doing anything at all and really freaking regret it."
bipolar,fgjxn97,t3_eyiuti,1580853393.0,"I definitely can relate to this.  Have they put you on any meds for the ADD?  I have bipolar 1 and ADHD but am only on meds for the ADHD at the moment but it does really help me at least in regards to motivation and the ability to get the hell out of bed.  

I wish I had more tips to help but I can only really commiserate at the moment because I haven't even figured out what to do myself sadly."
bipolar,fgjwwor,t1_fgge9qb,1580852978.0,Haha this sounds like me and my husband!  He is diagnosed with major depressive disorder but I am convinced he is also bipolar.  So our fights can be pretty damn epic.
bipolar,fgjwqa8,t1_fggdrce,1580852879.0,That would be so fun!  I'm totally down :)
bipolar,fgjwgvn,t1_fgebh12,1580852732.0,Haha I love this idea!  I used to have an annual Christmas party at my Uncles where I could wear really fancy dresses but since he has passed away I don't have the excuse anymore.
bipolar,fgjwdsi,t1_fggdea2,1580852684.0,UGH I am trying really hard to repress the urge to buy a new car right now.  I've dented and dinged my current one so badly that I am just itching to trade it in.  But I'm also remodeling my kitchen so I need to quell this fucking urge!
bipolar,fgjw7cu,t3_eyaxl1,1580852584.0,Oh lord I could have written this.  It is so horrible.  I hate those intangible off the handle rages.
bipolar,fgjw35j,t3_eybsu6,1580852520.0,I love this sub too it has been a HUGE help to me!  Luckily I have more then a few non-neurotypical friends so I have people in real life to talk to which definitely helps.  It is actually kind of amusing how many friends I have that are bipolar or have some kind of similar mental illness.
bipolar,fgjvu22,t3_ey6iba,1580852380.0,"I have this problem whether I'm manic OR depressed unfortunately.  Mostly due to the additional ADHD which also makes hygiene a chore.  The teeth is the worst though and I know that I need to figure something out for that and STAT cause dental work is expensive and painful.  I was very proud of myself for showering today lol.

I second/third the dry shampoo and baby wipes idea.  I do that a lot.  Luckily I have dry skin and hair so I can go quite a while without showering before I actually look or smell badly lol."
bipolar,fgjufqy,t1_fgiiuq5,1580851602.0,I did an ADHD assessment and that was how I found out I was Bipolar and had ADHD.  Oops.
bipolar,fgjuadd,t3_eytee8,1580851522.0,I am so terrified of this side effect (I also have an eating disorder I think but it is undiagnosed) that I haven't gone on any meds for the bipolar yet.
bipolar,fgju6ma,t1_fgjodk4,1580851465.0,"Me too.  SSRI's are very very bad for me.  SSNI's are okay, I did well on Wellbutrin for a number of years.  Need to go back on that."
bipolar,fgjtmcj,t3_eyb5r0,1580851157.0,I really really wish I could draw :(. But I'm horrible at it.  But I have found that coloring helps in those adult coloring books.
bipolar,fgjsxqv,t3_eys5bs,1580850772.0,"I feel this.  Now that I've been officially diagnosed I find myself trying to let myself use it as an excuse for being shitty.  But also we do have to understand that sometimes we really can't help it.  All we can do is try to mitigate it as best we can and make amends.  And yeah, GUILT, all of the guilt.  I feel buried in it sometimes."
bipolar,fgjslr0,t1_fghm86f,1580850582.0,Oh my isn't that the truth!
bipolar,fgjsj19,t3_eyjh8v,1580850539.0,Very very apt and well written!  Ugh.
bipolar,fgjs8eo,t1_fgj72cg,1580850376.0,Yup lol!  Once I got on that things did get better.  Though it still doesn't always work.
bipolar,fgjs4cr,t3_eyse26,1580850312.0,I'm not sure cause I ended up quitting my lucrative career as a software developer and am now bartending cause I couldn't handle it.  But I did manage for a loooooong time while undiagnosed just so I could have health insurance for me and my kids.  Now I've got it through my new husband so that helps a lot.  The added bonus of unmedicated ADHD didn't help either...
bipolar_irl,fgjrq1b,t1_ffrwzi2,1580850089.0,I think my record is 4 or 5 but it was a long time ago.
bipolar_irl,fgjrm5q,t1_fft4zwa,1580850030.0,I feel like that is a record actually!  You should contact Guinness lol.
bipolar_irl,fgjrjpz,t1_ffrlz5d,1580849991.0,For real.  We all do 24 hours like it is freaking nothing
bipolar_irl,fgjraej,t1_fgengfh,1580849846.0,"Seriously yes!  That stuff made me sooooo sick!  They tried to diagnose me with GAD and put me on that before I got the ADHD/Bipolar 1 diagnosis,  I seriously felt like I was going to DIE"
bipolar,ffht9uu,t1_ffht6wu,1579952769.0,Usually for me it is because I am manically cleaning but the idea is the same :). I was doing that earlier.  I am upstairs now so less chance of being a complete and utter nuisance but it could still happen!
bipolar,ffht7hy,t3_etmndf,1579952672.0,I wonder if really poor quality sleep is a factor as well?  I sleep a decent amount hour wise but the quality is absolute and utter shit.  I think it definitely takes its toll after a while.
bipolar,ffht4g1,t3_etpsgl,1579952549.0,I feel ya.  See my most recent post :). No hallucinations at the moment but ya never know.
bipolar,ffht2ew,t1_ffht01o,1579952461.0,Haha right?  It's mostly cause it is on my headphones and my husband is sleeping.  But I also relate to this when I used to listen to music at work.  My brain is stupid but I'm pretty sure everyone on this sub can relate :)
bipolar,ffhszb3,t3_etmed5,1579952334.0,Feeling this pretty badly right now.  Crappy sleep last night and now no sleep . Woohoo........
me_irl,ffhqfs9,t3_etp7xv,1579948420.0,I was waiting for this meme!!!!!
bipolar_irl,ffhqcw2,t3_et2hpp,1579948299.0,I showed this to my husband and he died laughing.  Even funnier cause this meme applies to both of us :)
bipolar,ffhpy5o,t3_etoml8,1579947666.0,"ALL THE TIME.  Especially right now.  Well not really, I'm in bed and not in public."
BipolarReddit,ffdweds,t3_et00ge,1579830589.0,I'm bartending.  I used to be a software developer but it was way too much stress for me.  Luckily my husband has me on his insurance now so I don't have to worry about that. Less stress is sooooo much better!
ADHD,ff9naqt,t3_esb0xj,1579716575.0,I went to the courthouse and got my marriage certificate so I could get insurance again after screwing up and letting my cobra lapse cause well adhd and bipolar hahahaha
bipolar,ff502jb,t3_ermiyb,1579576637.0,I feel ya. I do it constantly.
ADHD,fetrhij,t3_eqk6e0,1579378939.0,I love the facebook one!  That is great :)
ADHD,fetqzzd,t3_eqehuy,1579378599.0,Man do I feel this in my bones lol
ADHD,fetq4co,t1_fesc4pv,1579378259.0,Oh yeah this is a HUGE one for me!  And I am such a motor mouth sometimes I just literally can not stop talking.
thementalparent,fdl78jd,t3_e7dsqr,1578518227.0,Or Illinois.  Ugh.

ADHD,fdl2f2v,t3_elix69,1578515905.0,Yeah I fell in love with dark mode as well.  Almost all of my devices are set that way.
ADHD,fdl2bcy,t1_fdibeg1,1578515847.0,I put the blue light filter on all of my glasses now!  It is supposed to help with insomnia also I think.
ADHD,fdl17av,t3_eltqd5,1578515261.0,Huh this has happened to me a few times.  Never really thought about it.
ADHD,fdl13k0,t1_fdkynbp,1578515205.0,I didn't read this comment before I posted but that is kind of funny cause I went from IT to bartending haha!
ADHD,fdl10fj,t3_elxr5m,1578515159.0,I did.  But it was more for the Bipolar then the ADHD.  I was a software developer and though I was good at my job for the most part it was too mentally draining for me.  Luckily I have support financially and I could get away with that.  Though losing the big paycheck kind of sucks.  I'm just bartending now and honestly it is so much freaking easier on me!  Though standing up for that long hurts my bad ankle lol.
ADHD,fdl0mzu,t3_elug52,1578514959.0,I wish I could relate lol.  But I have Bipolar 1 along with the ADHD so I'm pretty much screwed.
ADHD,fdl0go8,t3_elql2q,1578514868.0,"Oh yes, been there done that!"
ADHD,fdl093i,t1_fdiavoq,1578514759.0,I used to get TLDR from my old boss all the time haha
ADHD,fdkzzo4,t1_fdiczwa,1578514616.0,SAME lol.  And also it reminds me of Charlie on It's Always Sunny :)
