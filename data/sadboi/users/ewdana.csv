Possible Negative reasons:

We are supposed to hit our peak by July end so it's still at the start. We are going to see more cases in the next two months. 

Also, there are concerns that the data is not accurate because we cannot afford to conduct tests at the levels needed or conclude death status.

Possible Positive reasons:

The general population is younger, temperatures are hotter, stricter lockdowns,we have a higher general exposure to pathogens

](https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/coronavirus-vaccine-reasons-to-be-optimistic-137209)

""Here are some reasons to be optimistic. One, this virus can be cured. Unlike some viruses such as HIV that embed their genome in our own and make fresh copies of themselves after immune elimination, we know that SARS-CoV-2 is¬†unable to persist¬†in this way.

Two, most infected patients¬†develop antibodies¬†and there is evidence of virus-specific¬†T cell responses. Although we don‚Äôt know if these responses are protective yet, these are precisely the responses that can lead to immunological memory, the cornerstone of vaccination. Vaccine products will be refined and enriched to induce more potent immune responses than natural infection.

Three, coronaviruses mutate¬†slower¬†than viruses such as influenza, and we know from Sars and Mers that antibodies can¬†persist¬†for at least one to two years following recovery. This is good news for an effective vaccine that may not require updating for quite some time."""

[A Drug Cocktail Hastens Recovery in Some Coronavirus Patients

""Patients given the three-drug cocktail tested negative for the coronavirus within seven days, on average, compared with an average 12 days among those treated with the one drug. The cocktail also cut the duration of Covid-19 symptoms in half, to four days from eight days.""

There are limitations to the study but they're hoping to conduct large scale ones soon! More treatments on the way, YES!"

This is my home state Kerala (which I'm away from) in India  and they have been doing great so far in terms of flattening the curve!

The state government has been delivering cooked meals to people who can't afford it. They've also built shelters for migrant workers stuck in the state and worked with service providers to increase internet speeds! 

""The measures appear to be paying off. Even though Kerala was the first state to report a coronavirus case in late January, the number of new cases in the first week of April dropped 30 percent from the previous week. With just two deaths, 34 percent of positive patients have recovered in the state,¬†higher than elsewhere¬†in India.""

 We've had histories with outbreaks with two Nipah virus outbreaks over the course of the last two years so the state government had a pretty robust system put in. Hopeful!"

I understand this very well. I had pharyngitis last week and had recovered. I woke up at 3AM today with a prominent scratch in my throat and freaked the fuck out. Spent 4 hours trying to get a hold of an online appointment with an ENT. Got through to one who said it sounds like i have allergies (which i have a history of). Not to mention i was on my periods and felt feverish and tired which i tend to feel usually. Checked my temperature and it was normal and then convinced myself that the thermometer was wrong XD
My anxiety was and is sometimes uncontrollable as i am convinced i have the virus.

 I worry about having it and giving it to my boyfriend and losing my loved ones.
I'm telling myself that i am doing my best. I have to take each day as it comes.

We have to remind ourselves that we have the coping mechanisms at our disposal and it's normal to feel whatever we are feeling. I am glad you have your gf to support you <3"
