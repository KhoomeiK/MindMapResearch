Absolutely this. I for a long time held grudges against friends, family, boyfriends and coworkers and in the end I held in so much hate no wonder I was thinking negative thoughts and spiralling.

In the end I realised other people and their actions are out of my control - but my own happiness and recovery? THAT I could control.

By acknowledging my BPD actions of ignoring others, I instead did the opposite of what a BPD symptom dictates - and did what a rational person would do (which in my case was take the time to reflect and learn about the event to avoid it happening again). Put simply, don’t let the BPD control you - it’s easy to act on impulse but that’s how the BPD wins. Start resetting your actions so that you no longer act out your BPD self. It takes time, but you will get there."
