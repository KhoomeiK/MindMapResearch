At least he took it positively. Even though what you did was a dick move. You thought you were being a “good friend” by lowkey shitting on his confidence because you didn’t like the way his hair or beard looked. He shouldn’t change the way he looks because you don’t like it.

You must live in Canada lol, or in a place where people are more accepting.
