ParentingInBulk,fh6xc5o,t3_ez3gwg,1581308508.0,"Three girls now, ages 5, 7 (8 in a few days), and 9. 
Our oldest two are my husband's and their bio mother is not involved and hasn't been since they were 1 & 2. Our youngest is mine, her bio father has never been involved. My husband and I met when out kiddos were six months, 3, and 4. I've been the only mom they've ever known and he's been the only father. We're planning to adopt each other's children to make us ""official"". After that, we plan to have one or two more 😍"

ask,fbdcpj7,t1_fbc1tuz,1576757678.0,"Honestly I feel really disrespected. I also can't stand the guy she brought over. I just moved back to my hometown at the beginning of November, so I was super excited to be close to her. She made me cover for her once and then showed up at 7am while I'm trying to get my kid's ready for school with a guy that clearly isn't her boyfriend (and even my kid's noticed ffs) and they went to the basement ""to the smoking room"" and I guess she fucked him. She's not too happy I told him. But she's changed so much. It breaks my heart."
