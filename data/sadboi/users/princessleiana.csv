TrueChristian,fq76xh9,t3_gh5iye,1589142572.0,"Habitual learning really. Reading books are great but if you‚Äôre already bad at being disciplined, might not be the best? Everyone is different but I try to always listen to worship music because it helps me really think of God, His attributes, etc. which in turn encourages me to pray with what is being spoken to me and instantly I feel better in my heart.. you‚Äôll want that feeling more. 

Simple things like prayer journaling before bed, doing those devotionals on the Bible app that you have to check off every day and it sends you reminders."
