I would say that the majority of people signing up for a zoom call stand up show are frequently digesting stand up comedy, and understand the rules / etiquette of being an audience member. I'd maybe look at how twitch streamers handle their audience members, or even look at how a dialogue works within a Facebook live video. Might give you some other ideas"

But since most of the music sampled 80s tunes, as well as early 2000s ""capitalism sound bytes"" (OS start up noises, text speech, dial up tones, midi music, etc.) It's difficult to pinpoint exactly where the capitalism critique comes from or what it's saying. I see vaporwave as a nostalgic guilding of pre internet life and the music attempts to glorify those feelings of the past, untethered by an internet connection.
