ptsd,fqov469,t3_gjejod,1589525780.0,"While I’m not sure how to deal with the COVID-specific part, I want to make the recommendations that as you eventually get to know a guy:

- be sure to run many many aspects of him and y’all’s interactions with a *trusted, mature friend who values consent and healthy boundaries in a relationship.*  you might feel like you’re over sharing, but tbh coming out of flawed relationships really screws with what you think is “okay” in a relationship, and having someone there that’s mature enough to identify things that skirt under your radar is invaluable 
- *trust your intuition.*  you might meet a dude that’s chill and hella nice, but for some irrational reason you feel a little weird about it, or there’s some random thing that’s a little reminiscent of a bad ex, or things like that.  *trust* these thoughts — they’re your subconscious telling you things you’re conscious brain isn’t ready to recognize/analyze yet. 
- *your boundaries are your top priority.* reflect on them as actively as possible beforehand, and communicate them clearly to your SO.

You mentioned that it’s really hard to cope.  I would recommend looking into these things (enlist your husband for support in researching them if it feels like too much):

- pretty, calming sensory objects (like candles, play dough, lavender pouches, tea, etc)  
- painting, music, or other hobbies that require you to stay in the present and focus on what you’re doing as you do it. 

With respect to intimacy: It is perfectly 100% reasonable to not be intimate with your husband for a year.  It’s perfectly 100% reasonable to not be intimate with your husband ever.  You get to determine what you want out of intimacy, if anything.  

If you do want intimacy — the conflict between what your mind wants (closeness with someone you love) and what your body wants (safety and distance) is really, really hard to deal with :( I would recommend a lot of communication and conversation and the slow, slow, slow building of intimacy pillars (eg one tiny, tiny kiss per month at a time).

- take a break from sexual intimacy for a while. This’ll help you figure out how you actually feel about it (eg whether you’re doing it because you want to, or cuz you know your gf does) 
- reflect on your triggers, make a list of them, and communicate it to your gf. This can include objects and environments, specific acts, specific tones, specific kinds of conversation during intimacy, touching specific regions on your body, etc 
- reflect on things that help you recover from dissociation (eg play dough, flower scents, grounding exercises, being told you’re safe, etc), make a list, communicate it to your gf 
- make non verbal and verbal safe words 
- if/when you start intimacy with your gf again, go slowly. just focus on kissing and enjoying kissing for a few weeks or months. if/when you feel good about it, just focus on touching each other’s waists.  remember, the milestones are based on what you feel comfortable with and want for yourself, not what you think you have to do.  keeping the tone loving, flirtatious, and joking may also help during intimacy. 

These things take a *lot of time*. You are *not* a failure.  What you’re feeling is so understandable.  Remember, it’s even okay to never want sexual intimacy ever again — you get to determine what your boundaries are and what you want out of intimacy.

Re dating: there are actually a surprising amount of people who are okay (and even enthusiastic!) about waiting until marriage.

It’s true that the hookup-y / always-wanting-sex kinda guys are v prevalent, but don’t overwrite the existence of these other type of pretty wholesome people.  

I eventually found my current bf, who’s incredibly wholesome, respectful, and doesn’t have any intimacy expectations from me.  He cares a lot about supporting me through SA. Again, jerks are prevalent, but there do exist men who will support and care about you and your experiences so, so deeply.

Friendships: This is hard to internalize, but you’re NOT a burden to your friends.  You’re in a phase of your life right now where things are hard, and you need some support to get you through it — asking for that support is 100% okay.

And it’s true that patiently waiting, and getting through each day and week as best as we can, is 80% of the effort.

You could temporarily try: 
- talking about what happened at a much higher level 
- talking about things that are related to what happened — like the symptoms you’re going through, or friend interactions you might have had recently that made you feel paranoid, etc — and working through that instead of directly working on what happened 
- talking about things entirely unrelated to what happened, and patiently waiting for your mind and body to feel comfortable, strong, and trusting enough to try talking about what happened again 

All of these 3 routes are completely valid and helpful. 

One thing I want to caution you against — try your best not to drop therapy.   I’ve developed a lot of anxiety around going to therapy appointments, and it’s gotten to the point where I’ve procrastinated finding a new therapist for months.

I journaled something similar to your fish bowl analogy recently; it feels for me like I’m in an underwater tunnel, and everyone’s trying to speak to me from the opposite side of that tunnel.

At the beginning of the summer I really struggled because I had just started an internship, and tbh I felt sorta dumb — it was like words would come out of my mentor’s mouth, and I couldn’t process them.  I felt super spaced out.  I’ve also been really paranoid that people can tell :// 

Eventually, it got better for me.  I think maybe the fact that I had to force myself to focus for 8 hours a day, that I was nearly always surrounded by people, that the weather and all was nice, and that I met a really amazing SO all combined to slowly sharpen my perception of the world.  I also did my best to ground myself whenever I was feeling particularly spaced out (“identify 3 yellow things in the room?  what are 4 objects that seem like they’d be rough?”), and I tried extremely hard to *touch* the world around me to re-engage.

b) I asked a similar question to yours in another sub many months ago, and the best answer I received was this: Healing’s a game of chutes and ladders.  Every so often you stumble upon a chute and tumble back a bunch of steps, even all the way back to where you started.  But the thing is, once you’ve slid across a chute once, that chute disappears.  So over time, there’s more ladders ahead of you than chutes.  In more concrete terms, over time, it becomes easier and easier to recover from these setbacks.  In your mind, you’re thinking of this as starting from scratch again, as if you wasted all that time spent healing — but actually, that time was invaluable, and it’ll help support you and make the recovery from where you are right now at the very least incrementally easier.  

c) It hurt me more than it helped me to constantly set my sights on “growth” and “progress” — the frame of mind put a lot of pressure on me to heal.  It personally made me happier to focus not on water and sunlight as instrumental to the growth of the tree, but on how nice water and sunlight intrinsically feel.  What I’m trying to get at is that you might want to consider just seeking out moments that are happiness-inducing to you and focusing on those (with the faith that growth and healing will inevitably follow).

I was in the same position with my ex. 

You’re right that you shouldn’t force someone to change for you — but it sounds like you’re forcing yourself to change for someone else.  That’s **never okay**. 

Advice: Communicate with him **directly and explicitly** that you prefer a role in the vanilla to dominant spectrum, and that you’ve been feeling uncomfortable by the submissive role you’re currently in.  See how he reacts — how a person reacts when their desires conflict with yours can tell you a lot about whether they’re actually as respectful and kind as they seem to be in other situations. 

HOWEVER — at the end of the day, if you feel that you keep falling into a role that you’re uncomfortable with, the relationship isn’t for you.  **You’re NOT doing yourself any favors by passively allowing your desires to be overridden.** It is a GREAT decision to LEAVE a relationship where you feel suffocated sexually, EVEN IF the person seems Good in other departments.

Please be sure to reflect and check in with yourself.  Consent, respect, and boundaries are things that can start to dissipate when you fall into a role that you don’t want. And *the result is an emotional mess.*

For a stranger to be able to touch you in places where you don’t want to be touched, without asking for your consent or even telling you they’re going to, and for society to be okay with that, is absolutely terrifying."

I can’t give you concrete advice because i have no details about your relationship, but at the very least, I’d recommend that you internalize that space and distance can be very healing and that it’s okay to embrace avoidance.  For you, this might or might not mean breaking up with your SO."
ptsd,ezda4dk,t3_d0quqp,1567847241.0,"Many pieces of advice based on my experiences:

- You might already have done this, but try sticking to other bases for a while before sex.  This will give her a chance to see what she’s actually okay with as opposed to rushing directly to sex, it’ll give you more space to be careful and respectful, and it’s an opportunity for more trust to grow. 
- Establish a verbal safeword AND a non-verbal safeword just in case. 
- Before having sex, ask her “are you okay if I do X?  what about Y?  etc” even for small-seeming intimate things, and then instantly respect her answers without question. 
- Ask her ahead of time what her triggers are if she knows of any of them.  This is REALLY important because certain totally innocuous phrases or interactions can be incredibly triggering, so you should have maximal knowledge of what triggers her ahead of time. 
- During, it’s helpful to reduce the intensity with flirtation, cuteness, and any affirmations that your girlfriend in particular values.  I’m not sure what you guys are into, but I found it nice to keep the tone fun and playful.
- During, feel free to take small breaks to check in with your girlfriend.  If she doesn’t want you to take as many, she’ll tell you; it NEVER hurts to play it safe and over-ensure that your girlfriend feels respected. 
- Afterwards, ask her for lots of feedback on what was good, what was bad, what was triggering, and how she’s feeling.  Make sure you her feedback translates to actual actions on your part. 

The main piece of advice though is — ask **your girlfriend** the same question you just posted to Reddit.  She’ll likely (a) appreciate that you‘re thinking about this, and (b) give you a lot more insight into what works for her personally than any of us could estimate. 

I... think it’s amazing that you’re one of those rare-seeming Good guys that cares about this. 

I truly wish you and your girlfriend the best."
rapecounseling,eyq3p6t,t3_cx2itf,1567323295.0,"In my opinion, a sexual act is never consensual if any parties are under the influence of any drugs or alcohol. 

These substances lower your ability to make rational decisions. If you can’t even drive while high or drunk, how can you expect anyone to make the much more involved decision of deciding whether to have sex while high or drunk? 

I think you’re asking yourself the wrong question. Your question should be, “was what happened wrong, should I take steps to fix it, and should I ever do it again?”  The answer’s yes, yes, and fuck no."
rapecounseling,eyq3dgd,t3_cx49jn,1567322808.0,"Like the other commenters said — this is really common. 

But that doesn’t mean you need to be the one to engage in this with her.  As with all things in the sex realm and outside of it, if it makes you uncomfortable to be a part of a rape fantasy with her, then you don’t need to do it. 

IMPORTANT: If you do decide to do this, make sure to have a *very clear discussion of exactly what she wants to do and exactly what her boundaries are BEFORE initiating anything*.   Don’t just assume; ask her, because you don’t want to risk accidentally hurting her.  Keep in mind that you’re both very young (I’m only 2 years older, but looking back, I was really naive), so it can be very very easy to make unwise decisions in this arena.  Be sure to ask people for advice and ask her for feedback at every step of the way.

ptsd,eypda6t,t1_eypapoc,1567296810.0,"Okay, but please take this with several large mounds of salt.  Keep in mind that I’ve only been together for 1.5 months with my current SO, and even though I really hope it works out, I don’t have enough wisdom in the identity-related trigger resolution department to say anything definitive. 

- My current SO really loves the same podcast that my ex loved.  That was initially scary to me, but I feel okay about it now. 

- Larger concern: My current SO has the same *name* as my ex.  This actually almost made me break up with him way earlier in the relationship.  I’m happy we’re in a relationship, but I can’t say that I’ve 100% moved past it.  I usually call him by a host of cute nicknames, because it honestly does still hurt to call him by his actual name.  As a concrete example of the fact that this has had an impact on my mental health — I had a panic attack recently because he made a playful joke about his name (back when he didn’t know that his name is the same as my ex’s).  

So.  This kind of identity-related trigger is maybe resolvable, but it maybe isn’t.  Regardless, it **will** take a toll on your SO’s mental health, and it might take a toll on yours too.  Your SO has to be proactively, autonomously willing — not just willing, *enthusiastic* — about resolving the trigger for any of this to work.  

IMPORTANT: 

Please please please *please* don’t be **that** guy who tries to “heal” someone from the self-centered perspective of helping them feel touch again. You are NOT in charge of your SO’s healing.  You’re not even the captain or assistant captain or anything.  Your SO is the one in the driver’s seat, and if they make a decision on this, it is NOT your job to convince them with what you think is right.  **Space can be incredibly healing.**  

The reason I emphasize this so much is because I had an ex who tried to heal me so that we could be in a relationship.  After we had broken up, he tried to stay friends with me, but he still flirted with me, and I could tell his feelings weren’t resolved.  This led to a host of boundary- and respect-related problems which led to his presence in my life making my life worse rather than better.  I actually ended up friend-breaking-up with him, and we don’t talk anymore.  I felt much better after cutting him from my life than I did beforehand (and it allowed me to meet my current SO, who’s honestly a gift).  So... to balance out the slightly more optimistic stuff above, take this example as a cautionary tale."
ptsd,eyp9yxc,t3_cy2hcq,1567294175.0,"I’m really sorry you guys are in this situation — I **completely** get your SO’s position :( 

I’m not really sure if there is a way to recover from such a trigger, but to start off with, does your SO *want* to recover from it?  Do they have any hope for your relationship, or are they willing to end it for the sake of their mental health? (Both options are perfectly valid and justified).  If your SO doesn’t want to move the relationship forward, there’s really nothing more you can do on the relationship front; you can’t force them to be comfortable with you. 

I also think that you should make whether or not you remain friends with them an explicit conversation — ask your SO what they want.  It’s possible that your continued presence in their life, even just as a friend, could also be destructive. 

I have some personal experiences in this arena of moving past triggers related to similarity to an ex, but I really don’t think I should offer this as advice or an example, because my experiences and the experiences of your SO are necessarily different. 

So sorry again that this is happening.  Please take care to maintain your own mental health; breakups are hard enough as it is, and these complicating factors can make things worse.

ptsd,eyb199n,t3_cw0dpl,1566973811.0,"A bunch of things (trigger warning). 

Current triggers:
* wooden headboards with bars 
* “you’re so soft”
* “we’ll decide in the moment”
* “good girl”
* fingers in my mouth 
* any sexual situation where I’m too submissive 
* “can I have one for the road”
* “just five more minutes” (during sex)
* the word r*** / SA / etc, or any media about this stuff, especially if it’s politically charged or victim blame-y
* any of my old apartment furniture (I threw most of it out when I moved) 

Old triggers I’m slowly growing past through a healthy, respectful, loving relationship:
* hands on my waist 
* me being little spoon 

Note: Discovering triggers can be a process, and even though I hope there aren’t more, there’s likely more things that I’ll realize trigger me as I progress in my current relationship. 

When I’m triggered, I usually flashback to what happened, and then I start feeling very dissociative — the world starts losing focus, and my eyes feel numb, and I’m no longer really in touch with the present.  Anxiety kicks up a lot, so I’ll often feel nausea and pain in my stomach, my head starts hurting, and I start breathing really quickly (panic attack-y).  Triggers often initiate an inescapable loop of all these symptoms for me.  If it’s particularly bad, I’ll go into freeze mode and not be able to move my body for like 30 minutes. 

Strategies I’ve employed to help reduce the effects of triggers:
* embracing avoidance — I only revisit triggers in a safe, respectful atmosphere, and only when *I* want to, and only very rarely so I have time to heal and enjoy life 
* counting up to 10 repeatedly 
* grounding myself by naming colors, textures, shapes, etc in the room to help bring me back to the present 
* making sure that I intentionally keep moving a part of my body whenever I’m in a flashback loop to prevent the onset of freezing 
* important: maintaining a healthy, regular sleep schedule and healthy habits (I realized that all of this happens more often and to a worse extent otherwise) 
* important: cultivating a support network of understanding friends and family who I can call whenever I need help (even though it’s hard to call them right after being triggered)"

It really does feel like shit.  Emotionally, I just craved a sense of warmth and love and safety, but physically, it felt like my body died a little every time I allowed literally anyone to touch it.  

The number one recommendation I can give you is *time*.  It *really is true* that with time, the land mines that just hang out in random locations under your skin waiting for someone to trigger them will stop reacting so strongly.  It would be a mistake to rush your body, to tell it “I’m going to make you stronger so I’m going to teach you to handle this touch” (relatedly, if an SO or someone tries to get you to “practice” dealing with touch in order to “heal” you, nope the fuck out of there).  Respect your body and its boundaries, and know that over time, your body will start to trust again.  It’s okay to embrace avoidance temporarily to give your mind, emotions, and body time to heal themselves, even though I know it’s hard. 

Secondly, please make sure you’re surrounding yourself with people who respect your boundaries and understand PTSD.  It was frustrating, for me, when I had to explain how certain triggers worked to my mom or an ex I was dating, and they just didn’t get it / respect it.  It’s definitely hard for people in general to understand PTSD, so be sure to have long meaningful conversations about how you feel with the people you care about, and for those that don’t change their behavior post-conversation, limit your interactions with them.   Explicit, repetitive affirmations that your family and friends can be trusted (however obvious this fact may be) can also help you build better, stronger foundations that enable your body (in addition to your rational mind) to trust again. 

I’m really sorry you’re going through this.  It can feel very disturbing and fucked up.  I’m definitely not all the way through getting past this, but we’ll both get better. 

Take care of yourself!  Please let me know if you need any more help."
ptsd,ex9g44i,t3_criiwp,1566088306.0,"I moved to a different city a few months after the cause of my PTSD happened, and the reset was amazing for me.  It was an opportunity to rediscover myself and reconnect with myself, and I think the radical change in environment isolated me from a lot of the triggers that I would have had to deal with otherwise. 

That being said, I don’t think we ever get a “fresh new start.”  An empty slate isn’t really achievable.  PTSD doesn’t define you and the feelings will become easier to handle and less intense over time, but they’ll still crop up every now and then.  I think it’s important to reflect on and learn from these feelings, so that if nothing else you can grow and gain the wisdom that comes from reflection.

A caveat to how I’ve been feeling post-moving is the fact that alongside the move came a new job, new friends, and the first healthy relationship I’ve ever had.

Something I’ve realized is that it’s actually okay - and even actively necessary - to maintain a bit more space temporarily while you heal.  It’s 100% okay to tell your husband that hey, you really don’t want to be touched right now (at all, or in a particular way, or at a particular time, or whatever best describes how you’re feeling).  Everyone heals at their own pace, and it’s NOT a good idea to rush into something you’re not totally comfortable just because you’re trying to force yourself to “heal” or “grow.”  That’s not true healing; truly healing takes time, and it happens without you or anyone else pressuring you. 

And if your husband is a good guy that actually cares about you, he’ll respect that - he’ll care about you and try to help you rather than convince you to let him touch you.  If he doesn’t... you might have some reconsidering to do.

The most important things along these lines: When she tells you she’s uncomfortable, or even if she just seems a little off to you, immediately stop whatever conversation or sexual act or whatever you’re doing, take a few steps back, and ask her about how she’s feeling.  Tell her you noticed she seems uncomfortable and it’s important to you that she feels great, and ask her what you can do to help.  Do this proactively; it’s better to ask her if she’s okay too much than too little. 

Words of affirmation are also helpful.  For example:
- “You’re so powerful and badass”
- “You’re in control — just tell me when, and I’ll immediately back off”
- “I want to do everything I can to make you happy”

rapecounseling,ew6beap,t3_ckokgs,1565161377.0,"I just want to caution you to keep in mind that it can be easy to accidentally put yourself in the same situation that you were in before.   So before you do anything in the rough sex realm, I recommend asking yourself the following:

- do I truly understand consent, or has my trauma / past relationship left me with a problematic internalized notion of what it is?
- am I good at communicating exactly what I want sexually in an assertive, clear way? 
- am I good at stopping things that feel uncomfortable, even things that are “small”?
- what have I learned about the kind of personality, characteristics, etc that can be red flags?  do I feel confident that I can weed out questionable individuals, with a combination of intellectual reasoning and trusting my gut? 

If you aren’t super confident about your responses to any of these questions, imo i really think that’s a good sign you need more practice, more reflection, and more healing before you get into something new.  Also even if you responded well to the above questions, if you’re still within a few months of what happened, chances are you’re in a more fragile state than you realize. 

Sex can still be fun, but keep in mind that if you overestimate how ready you are, you could be setting yourself up for a lot of pain.  (This happened to me — I cried for a few days straight, went into a fragile fugue for a month ish, and generally broke after making out too soon with a guy). 

And also keep in mind that all of the above applies extra because you specifically want to try out rougher sex.  Again, it can be fun, but it can also be an emotional land mine.

You seem to care about the person that you’re with, and you don’t want what you’ve experienced to affect them and your bond.  While that’s very caring, important piece of advice: you can’t separate your past from your relationship.  Symptoms that you’re experiencing, whether it’s triggers, depression, anxiety, paranoia, panic attacks, flashbacks, dissociation, whatever, they’re all things that take a lot of time to heal and will either (a) inevitably affect your relationship, or (b) crumble you from the inside as you try not to be vulnerable around your SO.  

It’s *not a bad thing* for your past to have some say in how you go about your current relationship.  Rather, it’s really helpful to discuss what you’re feeling with your SO, so that they understand where you’re coming from and can help you with it.  It’s truly an amazing feeling when you tell an SO about something that’s hurting you along these lines, and they’re able to comfort you through it.   Moreover, opening up this channel of communication is a really good way to make sure your SO doesn’t accidentally hurt you. 

Lastly, I know it’s really tempting to want to speed up healing (there isn’t, btw, a good strategy to just speed things up from my experience, though seeing a therapist helps).  But keep in mind that what you’re feeling now isn’t just a (really fucking) shitty part of your life — it’s a period of emotional growth.  I think it’s important to reflect on what you’re feeling (journaling helps a lot) to gain a deeper understanding of what you value and what you want moving forward.  This is actually really key to fostering future healthy and positive and fun relationships — a deep understanding of what you want, what you value, and what you don’t want. 

*You are not your past, but it’s okay to acknowledge that you and your future relationships are and will be affected by it and that you can grow from all of this.* 

I’m really sorry for what you’re going through.  You *will* get better.

Lastly — it’s amazing that you’re experiencing a positive relationship!  I know that all the doubt can be overwhelming and stressful, but I hope you fully revel in the fact that yeah it can be blergh, but being able to experience these emotions is another step, a testament to your growth and healing :)"

Sometimes when I’m having PTSD symptoms, it honestly feels better to just tell myself and others that I’m sick.  It legitimizes what I’m experiencing in my head somewhat, and it can be comforting to be surrounded by soup, friends, and Netflix post-episode.  

It sucks, but you’re getting through this fam.  Take care :)"
ptsd,evrsrtv,t3_ckf8a7,1564717392.0,"I opened up to the guy I’m dating early on, and it launched a channel of incredibly respectful, kind communication.  It formed this really nice foundation of enormous respect for boundaries, upon which more trust can grow. 

So if I have one piece of advice, it’s that yes you should take however much time you need, but also keep in mind that a little context communicated to your SO (whether it’s a list of your triggers, a serious conversation about consent, a mention of the fact that you had a not great ex, etc) can go a long way towards making sure they can give you exactly what you need.  

There’s a trade-off between the fact that explicit, direct communication is insanely important to a relationship, and the fact that it’s hard to trust someone with details of your past (especially when said past is hard to think about).  I don’t have a concrete formula for you along these lines, but I think it’s useful to reflect on both factors."

rapecounseling,erzmtrm,t1_erwkq3j,1561441689.0,"If your boyfriend is a good person, he will understand when you tell him how you feel rather than get his feelings hurt. It’s never a good idea to suppress your discomfort — it’s only ever conducive to pain and potentially abusive relationships.  

You’re entitled to your personal space — you’re not asking for too much or for something extra, you’re asking for what’s yours."
rapecounseling,erzmbxj,t3_c4efcc,1561441115.0,"If you tell him to stop and he “doesn’t really understand,” then it sounds like he doesn’t respect your boundaries.  You shouldn’t be forced to justify or negotiate how you feel about your personal space.  If you want to tell him why you feel this way, then go for it, but you don’t need a reason to express discomfort about something and have that discomfort respected (if your bf is making you feel like you need one, then that’s not good).  

“Healthy couples” respect and love each other, and touching each other even in these playful ways is supposed to be a manifestation of underlying consent and respect.  There’s nothing inherently “healthy” about the act in and of itself, especially if you’re not comfortable with it.

You have a right to your own personal space, and you have a right to be assertive about that.  Internalize this statement!! (I wish I did, as opposed to being so focused on my ex’s feelings)"

I think it’s used to treat people with PTSD / anxiety, and it’s helped me **so much** in feeling safe while I sleep and getting rid of other PTSD symptoms.  I can’t promise this will solve your problems, but given how drastically it’s solved a lot of mine, I highly recommend you at the very least try it out."
