RoyaleHigh_Roblox,fpwvexu,t3_gfz6ly,1588970686.0,"Offer 1 is way better. Here's why:  


Dear Dollie Skirt - 25k  
Dear Dollie Heels - 50k  
Shadow Empress Skirt - 28k  
Shadow Empress Bodice - 20k

  
Already this totals to 123k diamonds. Which is more than offer 2.

The remaining items are essentially free profit: Queen of the Ocean (25k), Guardian of Love and Justice (28k), and 3-5k diamonds. That's about 55k in extra profit.

123 + 55 = 178k. Offer 1 is basically offering you 178k diamonds.

Since offer 1 is in items, you will have to manually sell them in order to make your profit. If you're a smart salesman, you will make a great profit from this, especially considering that Shadow Empress set items are unpurchasable right now (meaning you can sell them for higher than their raw store value)."

RoyaleHigh_Roblox,fpq3bet,t3_gevwiu,1588814324.0,"""farming"" is a term we use in video games to describe the repetition of a task over and over. usually this involves spending a lot of time doing the same thing on repeat.

in Royale High, ""diamond farming"" means to repeat arduous tasks in order to gain many diamonds. as we all know, diamonds are the currency of this game, so people want to collect more diamonds in order to buy items from the shop. there are some methods which are much better than others in order to gain the most diamonds the in the shortest amount of time.

some examples of diamond farming include flying around certain maps (new Royale High, Enchantix High) to find and collect the diamonds sitting around on the map, and then wait for them to refresh only to do it all over again. another example of diamond farming is spending a lot of time at Sunset Island participating in pageants (people will often afk farm at this place because pageants run on their own)."

RoyaleHigh_Roblox,fpppgpu,t3_geurn8,1588806628.0,wow that's thicc. that's an amount of diamonds i could only ever dream of
RoyaleHigh_Roblox,fpp9eav,t1_fpfo7bf,1588798224.0,"Ok, i just tested this at the Royale High (new). It worked. It seems to reward 72 diamonds every time I collect them. The diamonds refresh naturally at such a fast rate (every 3-4 minutes, it seems). So this could be a very lucrative method, even for people without multipliers. Within 30 minutes this would earn me around 500 diamonds. However I noticed that the red diamonds on top of the waterfall (worth 20 each) do not refresh as fast as the others, so this would have to be taken into account. Either way, it is useful to collect the diamonds between every class. It is a great source of xp and diamonds altogether to farm at Royale High (new) although it still feels slower and more taxing than farming at Sunset Island."

RoyaleHigh_Roblox,fpp2sda,t1_fpfkvg5,1588794956.0,"if Sunset Island is the worst place to farm then where else would you recommend? I have no diamond multipliers either, so cruising around to find diamonds lying around is out of the question. I have tested spending time in Royale High (classic) and it doesn't seem to reward diamonds all that fast. again, i have no multipliers, so i get 300 diamonds per level up. leveling seems to be the only way Royale High (classic) rewards diamonds. (oh, there's also limbo'ing at the dance, which is lucrative, but still doesn't payout as much as i could make at Sunset Island in the same time.) maybe i'm doing something wrong?

i get at least 470 (200 consolation +270 voting) per pageant, which takes around 30 minutes, not to mention i also get xp toward leveling up so there is the occasional 300 diamonds. and if i place in 3rd, 2nd, or 1st (which i do sometimes) then my rewards are even larger. furthermore, i can afk here when i get bored/lethargic, so it works well for farming over long periods of time. where else in this game would possibly be more rewarding without multipliers??"

ptsd,fmhord2,t3_fl1ecl,1586088682.0,"dont let other people convince you youre being overly dramatic with your response to trauma. my dad claims to never have hit me when i was a child, and thus he refuses to acknowledge or apologize for it now that im 20. same with mom. i relate my ptsd specifically to the moment she choked me when i was 14. thought i was going to die then and there. now that im older and addressed it, she claims it never happened, that i never called cps and never had an interview with them at school that day. people will go far lengths to deny horrible things that they do to others, probably as a reflection of their own realities. their inability to admit the reality of the situation is not your problem. dont let others tell you that you are overreacting. your coping is your coping, and more likely than not an amalgamation of traumatic experiences building up over time in your life. the thing about trauma and breaking people is that it happens continually. so each time it happens again in the future, you may react in worse ways, but that in no way invalidates the experience. dont let others put you down for how you feel and what you believe may have happened to you, because if anything your feelings matter more than your assailants' here."
