malaysia,flr5o4c,t3_fq4jgi,1585413489.0,"What can I do with my 73 year old father who insists on going out every day to walk around in shopping malls and buy useless things he doesn't need during this time? 2 days ago, he wanted rojak. Yesterday he wanted sour plum. Today he wants to buy sweets. SWEETS! 

I've spent hundreds buying food for them to last weeks so he doesn't need to go anywhere, and after so many days of him promising not to go out and breaking that promise, I've resorted to giving a padlock to my mom to lock the main door and not give him the key so he won't go out. But now he gets angry, threatens my mom and even almost threw the old padlock at my mom. In his opinion, being locked in is worse than any virus. To him, telling him the risk of dying being very high coz his age is just an excuse. 

No amount of advice, yelling or begging has worked and at this point it's either just be prepared to lose both my parents coz one is extremely stubborn and he will probably infect my mom (I don't live with them), or have him arrested coz then at least he will stay put in jail until all this is over.

Not to mention other brilliant decisions he has made like gamble all his money away at Genting over the past one year to the point where he regularly bugs me for more money than I usually give him for necessities, and I had to give the money to my mom instead so she will only give a small amount a day just to buy food (not enough to gamble). Now with the virus going on, he got so mad at being locked in, he wants to SELL HIS FUCKING HOUSE. And his grand plan after that? Live in a hotel! Even though he has no money and all the hotels are closed now! And where will he and my mom live after that coz I don't have a place for both of them!

I was so enjoying the MCO coz I'm an introvert but my own father is driving me fucking insane"

Prayed a lot and got no answers. I don't really know if heaven or hell exists but I do still somewhat believe in God, just not what religions say about him. I think God did create everything but has now left creation to its own devices including humans. Perhaps a universal moral code with ultimate destination of heaven or hell does exist but no religion has got it right and we will only know our fate at the end when we die. Or it could be when we die, our spirits just don't go anywhere. Interestingly, I've had two non religious friends tell me they have heard the voice of God telling them something along the lines that religions have it wrong and religious practices are for the most part, a waste of time and there is no punishment or reward either way. Well most ppl might guess my friends were high, but one is one of the smartest guys I know and the other was a work colleague who was pretty chill to be with.

exmuslim,fersqqp,t1_fer9ona,1579357961.0,"Yup, and best part is that they always say that Non-Muslims need to shut up about the religion coz it doesn't affect them, but once I explain how it does affect me, they will either refuse to acknowledge it or resort to insulting me instead. Like I'm affected coz I have dogs and live in a predominantly Muslim area. I never walk them around my residential area in the day time coz high risk of them complaining. But even when I walk them at 2am when most people are asleep and pick up after their business, if I'm spotted by a crazy, they sometimes still complain to the management about it. Not like they are being forced to touch my dogs or my dogs are pooping on their lawn, but just the idea of people having dogs in their area burns up their entitled minds. Another way it affects me is that I'm dating a Malay guy who is actually not religious, but so far it's a secret and it'll probably be secret for a long time as I doubt I can marry him, at least not in Malaysia, since I would be required to convert which is a big hell no for me. There doesn't seem to be a way to commit to the person without the expectation of committing to the religion. And then they still want to believe that Non-Muslims are not affected by how the religion is practiced here? Yeah, fuck that shit

Actually I think it's especially unfair to the Malays who don't want to follow the religion but have no legal option to convert out of it. So you have to pretend to be like the rest of them for life else, otherwise you'll be ostracised. Or just have to move out of the country too."

SuperStarBTS,fdqc8mp,t3_ek7cxz,1578662735.0,"Here's a tip to reduce RP when upgrading S or R cards. This works only if you have spare S or R cards that you don't need. 

1) Level up the spare card by slightly over half of it's max level (I usually level up to level 25 for S cards and maybe level 27 for R cards)

2) Do the same for the S or R card you want to level up to max (level it up to slightly over half of max level) 

3)  Use the partially levelled up spare S or R card to level up the card you want.

4) If the level up is perfect, the card you leveled up would probably hit level 50 without need for more cards. But if it's just good, then you might need to top up to 50 with a few more cards

Reason for this is after the higher the card level, the more cards you need to reach max level. So doing this reduced the cards and hence the RP you use. Hope it makes sense"
depression,fd6otic,t3_ek3uky,1578193924.0,"I doubt this will cheer you up, but maybe offer a different perspective and possibly why she did it. I'm female and currently dating a guy with severe depression. He's amazing and loving when we're together. But the times we're together are so few and far between coz most times he can't see me or even talk to me coz of his depression. We started dating last year in May and only met up less than 8 times on about the same amount of months. Apart from our first date when we met at a restaurant, we haven't been out for a proper date at all, only him coming to my place which only about 4 or 5 times in 8 months. Other times I saw him only coz I showed up outside his office to surprise him coz he wasn't talking to me at all. Yes, sounds stalker-ish, I know but I really wanted to see him and he was ignoring me. He felt bad that I had to resort to doing that to see him coz he couldn't talk to me, so I stopped popping up unannounced. Anyhow the last time I saw him was on Christmas Eve when he came to my place and we had a great time. He has not said a word to me since he left my place until now.

He says he feels like a burden to me and so I want to be a supportive gf and be there for him patiently. But when I'm constantly ignored after trying to get him to open to me almost every day, eventually it takes a toll and makes me feel like he doesn't trust me enough to open up to me. He's even blocked me on Facebook but makes his posts public so I can see him sometimes posting and talking to other people but not me which makes me wonder if he is actually depressed enough to not want to talk to people or just me. And when I need emotional support and just someone to satisfy my physical needs, he's not around. The temptation to leave and find someone else is always there but I'm antisocial too and he's one of the few people I feel I can open up to but most of the time he just doesn't say anything. I'm also afraid if I leave him he'll feel more useless and try to commit suicide again, which he says he has done a few times.

Long story short, I'm not justifying that cheating is ok, what she did was definitely wrong but lying and saying she broke up with you. But from your end, maybe you have been behaving in ways that she feels is pushing her away, like how I feel with my guy. So maybe try talking to her about it"

depression,fczkc0t,t1_fczh343,1578103118.0,"Oh yeah Captain Obvious, another very helpful and motivational comment . Like seriously, you should look into become a therapist. Hopefully your clients don't commit suicide when you tell them they are using others and need help"
depression,fczfq4p,t1_fcyftfj,1578100245.0,"Well that was indeed very enlightening to say that a depressed person being quiet is being emotionally abusive. I should tell him to change his therapist coz that guy is clearly not doing a good enough job helping him. And I guess I need help too for trying to be there for a severely depressed person but apparently I'm using him to get my fix. I should just dump him now and let him continue to think the whole world is abandoning him coz he can't control his depression. If he commits suicide after that, which he has admitted to wanting to several times, that would be most helpful to him, I guess. No more suffering, after all. Thanks for the great advice, maybe try not being so helpful on a depression thread if you don't really understand it and are here to accuse depressed people and the people supporting them of abusing and using each other."
AskReddit,fcxlssm,t3_eixc75,1578066022.0,"Met my first bf ages ago on Match.com. He lived in another state and so it was long distance. Turned out to have anger management issues so I broke up with him and he created a fake profile of me online with my number sending horny guys my way to harass me. Luckily I managed to shut down that profile and it was peaceful after that.

 Met my second bf on OKC. He was 8 years younger than me and a hot good looking Dutch guy (different ethnicity from me). It was awesome and he was in love with me until his ADHD got the better of him and he realized he didn't actually love me. We were on and off for a while but it was when he started spouting blind support for Trump and hating any friends who didn't, including me, that was when I realized I was not interested in pursuing a relationship with this man child. 

Met my current bf on Tinder (also different ethnicity from me). We chatted and got along really well in 2017 and also met a few times then. Then one day he totally went silent and blocked me on all apps with no warning or explanation. I had no idea what happened but life went on. Last year around May, he popped back on my FB to chat with me, and though I was miffed, I got over it when he told me he was suffering from severe depression and couldn't talk to anyone for a long time. We started dating again and even slept together for the first time and it was amazing. But he still frequently goes days or weeks without talking to me. He hasn't blocked me on WhatsApp so he can still see my messages but just doesn't reply. When he feels better, he does chat and meet up with me but it will usually take weeks or months. Most of the time I don't really feel like I have a boyfriend but when I'm with him, he makes me truly happy. Still in that relationship. 

So 3 tries and 3 guys with some kind of mental issues, so I guess online dating hasn't worked out all that great for me but since I'm antisocial, it's better than nothing"

I'm sure most of you loled your head off at memes of people with their actual faces shown and didn't stop to think whether or not that person gave their permission to be used in memes and mocked by the internet üòÇ"

That shit can be worn elsewhere but not at the gym. No, she does not get a pass at being mocked for endangering herself coz it's her beliefs. There are other things she can wear to cover up that are appropriate for the gym.

If you love the religion so much, I think you are on the wrong subreddit"
exmuslim,ex73ni9,t1_ex5h4y1,1566055544.0,"Would you be OK with a woman wearing a long flowing dress on a treadmill? Think about that for a while. And if you see any feature of this women that will make people recognize her, then do tell. The good thing is the bag she is wearing which is also a treadmill safety hazard, kinda makes that really difficult"
exmuslim,ex73an5,t1_ex676n8,1566055392.0,"Yeah, I'm not funny, wearing a safety hazard outfit on a treadmill in a country where every other sane Muslim wears typical sports attire is funny. Oh yeah, you probably think this is Arab and she is being forced. You would be wrong"
exmuslim,ex72ysk,t1_ex6fd80,1566055265.0,"Burqas are not my country's culture, and we are a predominantly Muslim country. In all my years going to the gym, I've seen plenty of Muslim women wearing sports clothes, albeit long pants and long sleeves so they are covered up. They usually wear the hijab too. But this is the first time in my life seeing someone dressed like this at the gym, and since it's not forced her, then it's her own choice and it's a growing 'trend' to follow Arab style of dressing even though we are NOT Arabs. Don't be so innocent to think all Muslim women are forced. A good number of them do it freely, to become more 'pious' and then impose this style of dressing on other women who don't want it, and the trend to dress like Arabs is increasing her even though it was never our culture. Trust me, if she was being forced by anyone, it might be her own husband or male relatives who were nowhere to be seen at that gym. If she was alone and didn't like wearing that, then she would have changed. But she didn't.

Since it was likely to be her choice, to me, it is a stupid as women wear a long flowing dress to a gym. All she needs if got that thing to get caught in the treadmill resulting in a nasty fall and injury."
