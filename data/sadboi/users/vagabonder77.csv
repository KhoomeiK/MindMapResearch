TexEnts,fqnw7ty,t1_fqnvrx8,1589502627.0,We have so many people from Texas visit Colorado every year. It's like Colorado has been a Texan's second home long before legalization. And so many of these people are republican. Surely this will also help with normalization and acceptance.
TexEnts,fqnuqhw,t1_fqn6jrz,1589501781.0,I'm hoping that they realize how much money they can make and will be forced to go that route out of necessity due to the economic issues we'll be dealing with from the virus. I'd happily share some of my money with the state in making legal purchases here. Why should Colorado get all my money?
Marijuana,fqlvalv,t3_gji25x,1589466728.0,"For the six months prior to the virus outbreak, I was exercising regularly, eating fairly healthy, using creatine and using marijuana almost every night. I'm sure all of these things worked together to make me feel the best I've ever felt mentally, but it's definitely the MJ that brought good memories back to me, helped me see my life history from a more positive perspective, take accountability for the ways that I cause my own suffering, forgive myself, and now get to a point where I think I've identified the basic fears I carry around that drive my behaviors. My doctor wants me to start taking Prozac now and I'm debating whether to try. Part of me feels like I can slowly continue to get better without it, but I'm also not getting all the physical activity in that I was before the gyms closed down and it's hard to replace that intensity at home. And I can see how that missing piece is currently affecting my mental health."

mentalhealth,fnterl0,t3_fplncz,1587240188.0,"I felt like that in my 20s and I let that feeling lead me down the path of checking off all the life to-do's, like get married, buy a house, buy all the things, etc. It also lead me to a life that I ultimately hated and felt trapped in. I'm 42 now and I'm still trying to transform my life to something I want. 

Figure out what you want your life to look like because it's what you really love and then figure out how to live that life. The steps to reaching my blissful life look very different in comparison to my peers and I'm perfectly okay with that because I know what I want... and it's not their lives."

>Also for personal legal knowledge, school zones always have reduced speeds overall. In TX only schools on a highway have a speed of 35mph, otherwise it is 25mph or lower. 

Yes, I understand. In the dark, on this particular section of this road, it seemed more like ""highway"" than ""local road"" which is why the 25 mph school zone made sense and I didn't question it. It wasn't until I was approaching the stop sign that it appeared to be more of a residential street.

Thank you for your responses. I hope you don't mind that I edit your TLDR into my original post. I am clearly not good at summarizing."

One of the closets was honestly big enough to be a legit bedroom. The other was just a walk-in, but I brought an air mattress and slept perfectly fine both times.

I don't book with places that don't already have the information I need posted (or would require that I ask more than 1-2 questions before booking), and I'm not sure what I'd even communicate about beforehand. So I'm surprised to hear that I'm somewhat of a rarity. What are people discussing with you? Is it info that you can place in your profile to cut down on the questions? Or are they getting to know you on a personal level?"

""We are told that between 30,000-50,000 die annually of the flu, a dangerous and sometimes lethal illness that affects infants and the elderly the most. “…in the United States alone, over 36,000 people die and 200,000 are hospitalized each year because of the flu,” according to [Harvard University](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/10-flu-myths). 

Flu death statistics are usually tallied from the *Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report* database. But deaths from the flu and from pneumonia are lumped together in one category in the *MMWR*. This greatly inflates the number of “flu” deaths. And is a nonsensical way to capture statistics, as the majority of pneumonia cases have nothing to do with the flu!

Yep. It is true. The death rates from the flu that we are told year after year, repeated ad nauseam in medical training and in the media, are, as Bob Sears, M.D., puts it, “grossly inflated” (*The Vaccine Book,* p.121), and what this country doctor would say more plainly, are simply made up. """
