AgeGapRelationship,fjl44mt,t3_fdztc2,1583439561.0,"I have anxiety and depression and can get stressed out easily at times. Last year I had mentioned to my SO that I wanted to get a weighted blanket because it's supposed to help relieve stress. Ever since then, if I get really stressed out or wake up from a bad dream, he will lay on top of me and tell me he's my weighted blanket and just lays there telling me it'll be okay. Best weighted blanket ever :) The little things he does for me really makes me appreciate and love him so much more."

Needafriend,f0x3ur7,t1_f0x2p0k,1569020917.0,"You need to be first priority in your life. Get to where you want to be and maybe during the process you'll find someone on the same path as you. I started to finally get a stable career at the age of 34 and that's the same time I met my current bf. We've been together for four yrs. We don't have much in common, but it helps us to learn about eachother and we share the same path in life and I think that's what's important. Don't ever sell yourself short. You deserve to be happy, but make sure alot of that happiness comes from within yourself and achievements in life. You'll do great! Remember, there's no time limit for your path. We are all on different time lines. :)"
Needafriend,f0wo0ti,t3_d6z7za,1569010801.0,"If he is not willing to help take the burden off you, and you keep telling him everyday, yet he hasn't done anything to change, not even baby steps, then he's not right for you. He's holding you back.  You deserve to be with someone who listens to you when you are hurting and actually make the effort to ease that stress. I've been in your shoes in the past, and it was really difficult letting my bf at the time go for this same exact reason, however, I now have a stable career and my current bf treats me a lot better. You are still young. You have your whole life ahead of you. If he is not helping you and is making excuses and stressing you out more, then it's time to step away. You know what you want in your life, don't let anyone or anything stop you from getting there.  I hope no matter what you decide, that you are happy and I wish you lots of luck in life :)"
