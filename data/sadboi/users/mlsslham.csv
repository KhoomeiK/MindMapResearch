The fatigue and frustration I understand but when it gets to abuse that's a whole other story. It's extra disgusting being cruel to people that can't defend themselves.

The used to test us with a blacklight powder and spray when I worked at the hospital to see after you did various things in a room where the powder (germs) would get after you removed everything.

quittingphenibut,fd74a41,t1_fd6j0mt,1578199240.0,That's exactly what I was wondering thank you. I'm going to start with the agmatine and see if I can get back doen to 2g 2x a day by the time the baclofen gets here and go from there. Hopefully it'll also make dropping that easier as well.

I was doing fairly well, had a couple of off days and took an extra 500 mg which seemed to completely throw off everything I couldn't go back to where I was it was surprising. That was where I was on 2g 2x a day and getting back to a stable place is 3g 2x a day. I have to start all over.

It's faster and easier. Which is true, I let him smell it and look at it but I'm still afraid to tell him what it is. Or anyone else for that matter. I had a girl at my work see me take it and ask me if it was kratom because if it was it was just as bad as taking pills. So I told her it was mitra something specio something.
