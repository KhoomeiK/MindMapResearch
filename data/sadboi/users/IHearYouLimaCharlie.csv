My initial reaction is that the show did a fantastic job recreating both the wonder/fantasy of the actual event and also the disappointment at the end. However, 90 percent of the show/ film/ actual event was thoroughly enchanting so this is definitely all about the journey and not the destination in my eyes.

Honestly, I think in the real life event they could have just told the participants about the missing girl - that she was real, who she was, how she influenced the whole project, and maybe ended with a meditation to Elsewhere. I think most great ideas in life can be ruined when you try to curate for other people's expectations."

A can of diced tomatoes with juice also adds dimension and bulks it up for longevity. I am pro at whipping up pantry meals! 

Onions and potatoes last hella long, onions add flavor when quickly sauteed and potatoes are very versatile. 

I keep lots of flour and oil around because I like baking, but you can make pasta literally from flour and oil. Get cans of crushed tomatoes, make sure you have a big tin of olive oil, maybe some jarred minced garlic... easy pasta and sauce. Save the white bulbs from green onions, go grab some dirt from outside, and plant them in an old washed-out condiment jar. Put in windows for sunlight... those things grow like weeds and add flavor to everything.

I'm not even looking at the preview emails, I'm sorting them right into the bin without opening and reading. I don't even need the temptation!"
MakeupRehab,fi0a3oc,t1_fhzndc3,1582031555.0,I quit drinking last year and it's amazing how much I've saved since then. Cutting out that and now the beauty boxes will really give my savings a boost! It can be hard sometimes to defer gratification for something so far away (retirement) but I'm gonna do it!!!
MakeupRehab,fhzanr3,t1_fhz9y9c,1581994737.0,Thanks for another awesome idea! Now I'm not so sad about purging unnecessary items that others can possibly make good use of.
MakeupRehab,fhz7s6w,t1_fhz7nt7,1581992824.0,And you won't be drowning in useless samples either!
MakeupRehab,fhz5n6d,t1_fhz4xzq,1581991419.0,"That's great advice! While I haven't unsubscribed from all emails, I have (as a compromise) created a rule to shuttle those kinds into a hidden folder. That way if I do need to replace a crucial item (foundation) I can still pull up an email discount code, but I have to go searching for it purposely now. 

I'll check out some minimalist makeup channels. Do you have any favorites you would recommend?"
MakeupRehab,fhz4jz1,t1_fhz3so6,1581990713.0,😍
MakeupRehab,fhz4j03,t1_fhz47zv,1581990695.0,Most excellent!!! Thank you!
MakeupRehab,fhz31u8,t1_fhz2uqx,1581989723.0,"O damn, I had no idea I could clean them up to give them away!!! I don't need robotic shiny cheeks but some of my coworkers might! 🤣 Thanks for the tip! I'm excited to get my closet back under control, lol."
MakeupRehab,fhz2wtr,t1_fhyyhmc,1581989631.0,"Yeah, when I finally use up everything then I may consider subscribing to one, and only one, depending on what I feel the need for. The box you're getting sounds much deeper and more interesting than the crap ton of ugly off-brand eyeshadows and liquid lipsticks I was constantly getting! Right now my money is better spent elsewhere (but it still hurts!)"
MakeupRehab,fhz2hvp,t1_fhz0jhz,1581989356.0,"Yassss, that's exactly it!!! I love to travel and thinking about the money I save on these useless Beauty boxes that could be put towards a new experience is eye opening (and also 401k)! It was there somewhere in my subconscious but thanks for putting it here in words, it made it much more real and tangible!!!"
MakeupRehab,fhz28r9,t1_fhyx9qj,1581989193.0,"I definitely need to take the time out to do a massive inventory and organization. A problem I have is that I grew up pretty poor as a kid and now I'm blessed with abundance, which means I keep bad products as ""backups"" or ""just in case"" (we never wasted products). I think I need to separate and group all the similar items, and if I attempt to use one and don't like it, just throw it out! I'm inspired to get a plan together now!

And yeah, I don't wear highlighter AT ALL (my skin is oily enough on its own) but ask me how many highlighters I have floating around this place. 🤣"
MakeupRehab,fhywfli,t1_fhyvutm,1581985320.0,"I really did find great stuff through these subscriptions. I used to have bumpy skin and now it's smooth! But I find it's pointless to keep trying different moisturizers when I have one now that works 100%.

I've not even attempted the ""shopping"" of my own samples because I have SO many, but maybe I can sort of organize them and start doing that. I'm sure I have tons of stuff just waiting to be tried! It's almost overwhelming. I feel like I have enough mascara to last me for all eternity."
GenX,fhyw30u,t3_f4zz44,1581985089.0,"OMG, I remember driving around blasting this song in the car with a bunch of idiots. Haha."
MakeupRehab,fhyvbyq,t1_fhx3tvi,1581984590.0,"Ha, I got one of those years ago! I did really like it but it was too much of a pain to use regularly."
bookclub,fhxfhtz,t1_fhx9aqd,1581953156.0,"Yeah, I'm really looking forward to how all that plays out. :)"
bookclub,fhw8ujr,t1_fhvw598,1581909292.0,"I too was devastated about the chestnut tree and the fungus. Noooooo! :(

As a gamer, I was interested to note that the accelerated path to victory in Neelay's ""Mastery"" game is called ""Enlightenment."" Made me think of Mimi's Buddhist scroll. 

I very strongly identified with Mimi just sitting under the pine trees. Whenever I went camping as a kid, I'd always pitch my tent under pine trees. That's the best scent in the world. I had hope that Douglas would intervene and at least delay the destruction of that pocket park. Reading about the razed tree stumps oozing sap was so depressing. And graphic, in a weird way. 

I'm really enjoying the actual prose as well. This is a pleasure to read. I'm fascinated to see how the various storylines will come together."
GenX,fhvaemi,t3_f4x61a,1581895103.0,I feel like I must be sitting in that same bar at that same moment wearing that same stuff. Lol.
stopdrinking,fhky4jq,t3_f3pw56,1581693275.0,"Hey, it's Mr Grey Beard, I remember your original post! Check you out, you look amazing! Like an entirely different person, wow!!! Thanks for the inspiration, keep up the great work. 😃"
bookclub,fh9gtc2,t1_fh9apxl,1581380986.0,"Oh my gosh, I love the Aspens part. Years ago I learned about them being one organism and it blew my mind. I don't live anywhere near Aspens so I never get to see any. 

I agree about the hindsight is 20/20 interpretation of that last line. Funny, I also highlighted the same section! I like the idea of interconnectedness. 

I'll also add that I'm enjoying learning about the different kinds of trees while reading. I keep pausing to look up the different kinds because I'm a very visual learner. Very cool.

Edit: can't type on phone 🙄"
