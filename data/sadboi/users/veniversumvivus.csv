BPD,fpdv27w,t3_gcrq8n,1588534814.0,"I had LSD and shrooms. The first I did about three times and every one of them was different:
1st time i didnt quite enjoy it , I was just very quiet and thinking about my life, relationships, bpd, studies , etc. Felt like going down on a rabbit hole.

2nd time was AMAZING. I absolutely loved it. I felt very very happy, everything made sense , I felt deeply connected to everything and everyone. Still wasn't very talkative, but it was a great experience.

3rd time was just plain weird. I wasn't in the best mindset and I think that really influenced the whole trip. 

Shrooms was very much just ""what the FUCK is going on"", but not bad tho. Just confusing.

I guess (at least with LSD) that each person has a different experience , there's no standard ""oh, this is how its supposed to be like"".

My advice would be to try for yourself. But remember, do NOT underestimate psychadelics. 

Overall, it made me realize some things, both good and bad. There's a lesson in every trip :))

Stay safe!"
AskReddit,fo3fgww,t1_fo1bbry,1587486005.0,"My ex was one of those.
The most memorable episode (in a really bad, fucked up way) was when of our closest friends learned his parents were in the hospital because of a car accident; they turned out fine, but he was freaking out when he knew.
Me, my ex (who was a fireman at the time) and a couple of close friends went to the hospital to support him. Upon arriving and talking to him to understand what really happened, he decided it was marvelous to say ""Im sorry bro, i know it sucks. I also had a very shitty fucking day"" and proceeded to vent about how terrible work that day was. 
Everyone was baffled. 

None of us talk to him anymore."
portugal,fkk6h60,t1_fkk5mj0,1584275202.0,"É o melhor a fazer. Honestamente acho que é das melhores medidas que vi até agora. Evita-se contacto, evita-se contágio."
portugal,fkk4n5n,t3_fhmmk6,1584273287.0,"O problema, como já via aqui mencionado, é mesmo a falta de noção das pessoas .

Eu trabalho num supermercado, na cafetaria. É ridícula a quantidade de pessoas que aparecem com máscara sem necessidade, ou que esvaziam as prateleiras a pensar que isto se trata da peste negra. 
Há pessoal á pancada por causa de um pacote de arroz ou por 20 rolos de papel higiénico..há que ter um bocado de senso comum. Já para não falar da quantidade de pessoas que tosse para o ar, em vez de fletir o cotovelo e tossir para lá. 
Na minha área , eu mexo muito com comidas, bebidas e dinheiro (que é uma das coisas mais sujas em que se pode pôr as mãos) e sou obrigada a usar luvas sem as poder tirar durante o serviço, apenas trocar de vez a vez. São medidas que parecendo que não, acabam por fazer diferença.

Certo que temos que ter cuidados básicos, como lavar as mãos , mas para todos os efeitos parte de nós evitar a propagação do vírus. 
Tudo bem que a taxa de mortalidade é baixa , no entanto não nos podemos esquecer que se propaga muito rápido. É tão simples quanto alguém tossir para a mão e tocar numa superfície sem saber que está infetado. 

Pessoal, se não se sentem bem, se têm tosse ou dores de cabeça ou a garganta inflamada ou qualquer coisa que possa ser parecida ao COVID-19 , fiquem em casa. Não é ciência nuclear. Não é ir a casa dos amigos porque não se tem de ir trabalhar. Não se trata de férias mas sim de saúde pública a uma escala mundial. 

 É literalmente lavar as mãos , desinfetar , não andar em discotecas a lamber os copos de toda a gente e ficar em casa a ver Netflix ou TV."
BPD,fk5ns2j,t3_fgb0s6,1583884313.0,"Been through something similar. 5 years and one day, gone. Didnt return texts, calls, nobody knew anything and we , too, were working things out and the morning he ghosted me, we had sex and he kissed me in the forehead and said 'I love you' before going to work. 

I decided, after a while, to just take a step back and accept that I will never have closure. It hurts, it hurts a lot. I think about him everyday. About everything. 
I blocked him everywhere, changed my number and forced myself to let him go and it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. But it works, it gets better. 

I hope you get through this, but remember you're not alone. You will heal ♥️"
BPD,fk5lvfu,t3_fgh8zj,1583883181.0,"My personal favourite so far was along the lines of (while pouring my heart out trying to explain bdp):

""Yeah, but you can't use your disorder to justify everything. I know that it's bad but you can't say your personality if defined by it or you act a certain way because of it."" OR the CLASSIC ""just don't think about it"" .

This post is what bpd really is about. It's not a ""bad day like everybody has"" , it's not ""throwing a tantrum"" or just ""being an asshole when you're mad"", it's so much deeper than that - it crushes you. It's a black hole, it's always there.

I was diagnosed some time ago and I always knew , no joke, no bullshit, that the way I felt and hurt inside wasn't normal, not to me not to anyone but it was always overlooked and simply understood as a child misbehaving or a teenage drama.

People have no idea how much of a challenge it is to try and live a normal life , contain your emotions, go to your job, interact, try to not give in to your insecurities and trust other people. There are people who are struggling to keep themselves alive or get over their void through alcohol, drugs or isolation, just to feel something.

To all of you out there , please take care of yourselves. It gets better."
BPD,fix1yp0,t1_fhz3lvd,1582810571.0,">Even now when I express to them how sad I am about this they always disregard me.

Yes. My Mother and I had a long talk about BPD some time after I was diagnosed. She said things like ""I wish you weren't weak , but thats just the way you are"", like she was completely unaware of how the way I was brought up played a huge role on who I am and how I percieve myself today. She supported me going to theraphy and got the gist of what it is for me to simply wake up every morning, but has not even come close to fully understand and accept that it was somewhat her fault. 
To this day, I cant be honest with her because she'd always beat me up when I was growing up while saying ""if you're honest, I'm not going to be mad and/or punish you"" or ""if you lie to me , I'll put you on a plane and have your father to deal with you"" and that is the root of my abandonment issues today, not just with her ; with everyone. I am constantly afraid that me being truthfull will drive people away, so I bottle up my feelings and concerns because I feel safer that way , not realising how toxic this behaviour is.
There are a lot of things she said early on that really stuck with me , such as ""if being stupid hurt, you'd be bawling"" or ""you're just like your father"" or just simply calling me weak , stupid and irresponsible. 
All of that is taking its toll in my life."
portugal,fi9y8z3,t1_fi9y7rd,1582287346.0,"Perdão, caríssimo. Tem razão."
portugal,fi9y0s0,t1_fi6ncg5,1582287112.0,"Então olha lá. A eutanásia é ""desumanização"" por dar uma alternativa a sofrimento? Se tiveres um familiar doente, acamado, sendo que és tu que lhe tens que dar banho, alimenta-lo, levá-lo a fazer as necessidades e não tens acesso a cuidados paliativos , como é que o vais fazer? Vais desistir do teu trabalho para ficares em casa 24/7 para cuidares dele? E se esse familiar um dia se virar para ti e disser ""por favor, eu não quero viver assim, é humilhante, por favor deixa-me morrer""? Vais dizer que não? Vais tirar a única liberdade de escolha que essa pessoa ainda tem? Achas que isso é mais ""humano"" que a eutanásia? 
Dizes que a eutanásia é homicídio. Homicídio? Não o é. Acho de longe muito mais desumano obrigares uma pessoa a ficar viva quando ela nem de si sabe tratar por puro egoísmo e conforto da parte de quem a quer ter cá. Isso sim é desumano: veres uma pessoa todos os dias encharcada em merda, em mijo, sem se levantar, provavelmente já a nem comer/ver/ouvir/falar em condições, sem se lembrar quem tu és ou porque é que estás ali ou o que é que se passa. Se a eutanásia é desumana e homicídio, tirar essa escolha a alguém deveria ser considerado tortura. 
Quanto ao último ponto...já percebi que tudo na checklist vai contra os teus ideais pessoais. Então a teu ver uma sociedade ideal e tradicional seria composta por crianças fruto de violação porque as mães não têm direito a abortar, ou com GRAVES deficiências que vão condicionar a vida toda dos pais; casamentos de fachada porque uma parte (ou ambas) não podem expressar livremente o seu amor por quem realmente amam porque a sociedade os vê como uma abominação da natureza; crianças que nunca na vida vão ser adotadas porque já passaram a marca dos 2/3 anos e já não são ""fofinhos e adoráveis e fáceis de educar""; mulheres frustradas porque não conseguem ter filhos, que já experimentaram todas as alternativas (tratamentos de fertilização, in vitro, etcs) e que provavelmente vão passar o resto da vida numa depressão exatamente por não terem a possibilidade de ""ter"" uma barriga de aluguer; drogas é subjetivo e não tão linear como os pontos acima referidos mas mesmo assim, meu amigo, se descriminalizar as drogas reduz a possibilidade de ser esfaqueada no meio da rua , foda-se, compra uma grama de branca e chafurda a cara nela, quero que se foda. Não é a minha vida, não é o meu corpo , bom para ti. A tua liberdade acaba onde a dos outros começa. 
E isso da sociedade tradicional é muito relativo. O que é que queres dizer ? Deus , família e pátria? Por favor...ainda agora ouvi na RTP2 uma mulher no parlamento a dizer que a eutanásia é uma ""aprovação revoltante"" porque as pessoas ""podem sempre suicidar-se"". Não, sentar com as pessoas que amas e ter uma conversa sobre a tua vontade de ter eutanásia é uma abominação mas é tranquilo chegar a casa e encontrares um ente querido pendurado pelo teto no meio da tua sala de estar 👍👍 muito bem."

BPD,f2mrh82,t3_dd45an,1570308068.0,"Dont do that.
I did it for five years, it ended with him turning my house upside down , calling me crazy, dragging me across the house by my clothes, throwing me to the ground because I Turner my back on him during a fight. It ended with him ghosted me, blocking my number and cheating while I was at the hospital for attempted suicide. I did everything to keep him close because I was afraid of being Alone. It completely fucking destroyed me. Dont allow that. Its better to be alone than with someone who'll treat you like shit because they think you're crazy. 
Have some self love. I learned that the hard way."
BPD,f2054ky,t3_dbbbll,1569855395.0,"Thats BPD in a nutshell. 
When I was diagnosed, I felt relieved at first bc i finally knew what was going on but then...its good to understand what it is all about but dont forget : triggers are not the same for everyone. Two people with BPD can have very,very different triggers; find out yours ; make a list : identify the trigger, the when and the why. This will help you feel in control. You'll know when you're you or when its the BPD talking and taking over."

Later I was told by the person I was with at the time that we were lucky because what we got was really ,really good and that I spent ten minutes in the bathroom when I could have sworn on my life I was there for AT LEAST an hour.
