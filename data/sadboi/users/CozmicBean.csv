Advice,fq68sn4,t1_fq1gabl,1589126796.0,"you’re absolutely right. i’ve looked into therapists around my area, they’re just really expensive and i hope i find a good one soon. i really, really need it honestly. but yeah, she’s always been like that. it’s like i can’t win either way. she’s always been incredibly emotionally manipulative and abusive, so tbh i’ve had to hide and lie about a lot of things throughout my life. 

texting her might be my best bet. i don’t want to spoil the day, especially because i haven’t seen her in a few months due to the virus. i just hope she doesn’t get mad that i didn’t tell her in person, and sooner. i’m just accepting that her anger is inevitable at this point, but texting her would be a lot easier because if she does freak out, i can just wait to reply until i feel comfortable enough talking to her about it. i really don’t want to ruin tomorrow, i just want to have a normal day with her. i’ll wait until later on this week to text her. 

it’s funny because, despite being an adult, and not living with either of my parents anymore, i’m still so afraid of her. she still tries to treat me like a child sometimes, even just through text, because she’s controlling and that’s just what she does. i keep trying to tell myself that i’m on my own now, and she can’t possibly do anything to me now, but she still stresses me out a LOT. i don’t think she really acknowledges that i’m out of her control now, and grown up. i wish i could just suck it up and have a normal relationship with her, and i hope this whole thing doesn’t ruin it again. i am trying to though. maybe being honest will actually help. i don’t know. 

sorry for all the ranting but thank you, so much. this really helped. i’m really hoping that this just goes well without any problems. thank you."
Advice,fq1ahai,t1_fq19da3,1589043808.0,"trust me, i’m gonna be very cautious. i’ve just been wanting to see what she’s like for myself, because my mom has always had this habit of talking so much shit about other people when really she’s just projecting. she’s done it to my friends and people she hasn’t even known. but thank you, i will. 

i’m completely positive. she posts pictures and videos of her and her family all the time, and i mean all the time lol. plus i’ve seen pictures of her and my mom and their siblings when they were younger, and she looks the exact same, just a little older. 

i’m taking my boyfriend with me because i’m comfortable with him, and also because i’m terrified of flying and don’t think i could handle it by myself lol. my closest friends know what’s happening and where i’m going. thank you for this."
Advice,fq19hah,t1_fq16v7q,1589043521.0,"she’s been saying for the longest time how she just wants me to always be honest with her about everything, and i really want to, but just the very mention of my aunt’s name is enough to piss her off. she’s been a lot more chill with me than she used to be, but she still has her moments. i’m really beating myself up over not telling her sooner, i hate that i waited until mother’s day, but i feel like she’s gonna be angry either way. 

she’s also apologized for the way she’s acted in the past but, apparently from what my sister has told me, she hasn’t changed at all. so you’re right about that. i don’t think she ever will. but here’s the thing — if i don’t just tell her, i KNOW she’s gonna find out some other way. she has my aunt on social media and i have a feeling she’s gonna want to post about it, considering she hasn’t seen me since i was an infant. i’m afraid of my mom finding out the hard way, because then that’ll just make things worse. also, no, i haven’t seen a therapist in years, but even then, it was never with her because i wasn’t comfortable enough. i don’t know how she’d feel about that, but i’ve been wanting to for a long time tbh."

we were all making minimum wage but, because my gm thought she was attractive and a good worker (which she wasn’t, she was really bossy and full of herself yet made mistakes all the time), she received a 50 cent raise within less than three months of working there. i know that’s not much, but literally no one else has received a raise except for her, so i’ve been told. she wasn’t even that good of a worker. he just wanted to bang her."
