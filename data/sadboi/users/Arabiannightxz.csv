However with most hominids, especially homo sapien, as our brains grew, females' hips couldn't keep up.  This is mostly because we are bipedal. This makes it so we have to give birth extremely prematurely meaning the babies don't have the abilities other mammals (with smaller braincases) do.

WritingPrompts,fpi2vvp,t3_gdaea6,1588632591.0,"There was an odd coolness in the breeze on an otherwise hot summer day.  I had spent my morning cleaning up the barn while the cows were out grazing as I did when I was unsuccessful in making my brother do it for me.  The work was hard, but my father always insisted it would be good for me.  I didn't see how, but did my work quickly so I could have the day to myself after wrangling the cattle back into their pens.  

Everything went as smoothly as normal as the day passed into mid afternoon and my father hooked up the dairy pumps while I brought the last two cows inside.  The coolness in the air started to make more sense as I looked up and saw the large clouds rolling in from over the mountains in the distance.  

My heart immediately sank as an overwhelming sense of dread settled in my chest.  The sky blackened more and more and I tried to steady myself as I walked into the barn to warn my father.  The change in his granite facial features was immediate.  His stern and stoic face was tainted with obvious fear in his eyes.  

""I'll get the rifle.  You get your brother and mother in the house.""  I nodded and ran to our small farm house knowing what was about to descend upon us and yelled for my younger brother who was striking one of the fence posts with his carved stick he made believe was his sword.  

""Caleb get inside!"" I yelled to him, ""There's a thunder storm coming!""

""I'm saving a fair maiden from a wooden knight!"" he replied in an irritating whine.  

""Caleb, Dad said get inside right now!  do you want him to make you?""

Cringing from the last time my father had disciplined him for not going inside when he was told he sheathed his 'weapon' between his belt and jeans and stomped toward the house.  I knew my mother would be tending to the garden behind the house and sprinted that direction as the first rumble came rolling over the land like some kind of gigantic monster trumpeting its deep growl from miles away.  

""Mom! Dad said to get inside!  There's a thunderstorm coming!"" I yelled to her as I stumbled around the side of the house and leapt over the small garden fence.  Anticipating this, she had already removed her gloves and threw them to the ground.  

""Aaron, how many times do I have to tell you not to jump over the fence?  There's a perfectly good gate not two feet from where you hopped over and now your muddy shoes scuffed up the wood I repainted just last week.""

""Mom, can we please just go inside?"" I pleaded with her as she rolled her eyes and turned to enter the back door to the house.  

""You and your father really need to get over your phobia of lightning.  It's really getting to be ridiculous.""

I didn't respond.  I learned not to since any explanation would always fall on deaf ears.  *There aren't things in the clouds,* she'd always insist.  *The lightning just plays tricks.* When she didn't hear any response she continued her normal lecture as if picking up where she left off 100 times before.  ""Lightning can be dangerous and has killed a couple of cows since your father has worked this farm, but you guys fear it like Satan himself is waiting outside.  It's not even twister season...""

I ran off through the house, her voice trailing off behind me as she and Caleb made their way to the basement.  I burst through the front door to the porch and found my father staring intently at the sky like he was searching for Nazi war planes.  He'd been in the infantry in France and had survived many bombings, but as he put it many times before, he never feared for his life like he had the thunderstorms over our farm.  

""Son, are your mother and brother downstairs?"" he asked with a low timber to his voice nearly matching the thunder rolling in the clouds above.  

""Yes."" I responded breathlessly.  

""Good.  Now here,"" he said handing me his M1 Garand.  ""You remember what I told you?""

""Yes.  I'll take care of them if anything happens.""

He nodded and smiled at me.  We both turned and looked back up toward the sky.  Lightning began to streak across it, jagged edges reaching down to the surface like unnatural blue webs that blinded us for the split seconds they existed.  The last thing I remember was the hulking black form descending from the clouds and my father screaming something at me through the roar of thunder.  That was the last time I ever saw him.  

At least my Mom doesn't think he was crazy anymore."

Even with a toddler just using something like ""excellent"" instead of ""good"" will have them learn to use it more quickly and it's much more meaningful for them if they misuse the word and you correct them rather than dumbing it down for them. This is a good way to get them to think that yummy and scrumptious are two different words with different meanings.  For instance a flower can be beautiful and fragrant. The ""and"" usually connotes that a thing is both beautiful and fragrant. Saying the flower is beautiful and pretty is redundant and could cause a child to think that beautiful is different from pretty. It's a good sentiment, but just opting for the more complex word is slightly more beneficial."

StarWars,fbt02xs,t3_ee1zpd,1577064748.0,"It was surprisingly fine. By no means was it a masterpiece but by no means was it as trash as all the reviews. The first act was annoying. The second act was convoluted and boring and the 3rd act was actually quite good given what the movie set up. The acting was pretty damn good, Adam driver was by far the highlight of the film, and the action was well paced compared to what came before in the movie we will never name. Honestly if this movie was extended and split in two, wiping out the last jedi, we would have a really solid trilogy up to par with the sequel trilogy and eve. Surpassing it in some respects. But given what we got, jj Abrams gave us a finale that gave me a glimmer of hope when going in I was devoid of any. I honestly recommend going to see it. Its worth a chance at least and isn't the slap in the face I was worried about. It was pandering and fan service with some good writing sprinkled in. It's a massive ""fuck you"" to Rian Johnson and defenders of the last jedi which I personally wanted. It's better than tlj which wasn't a hard thing to accomplish and it was better than attack of the clones. But honestly it even was better than the phantom menace which I have fond memories of. It's a middle of the road movie which for star wars means its a better film than most trash that comes out nowadays. It's disappointing that the finale is mediocre but what else could it be at best? Nothing could have been done other than removing tlj and starting over which isn't possible because of Carrie Fischer.

I'm just playing devils advocate here and I'm currently in school for my A&P so I'm not an expert.

I just don't see how this should be punished so heavily. No lives were in danger at any point because the sabotage had its intended effect and kept the aircraft from taking off. If you're going to stop a plane from taking off and don't want to kill anyone wouldn't you block a pitot tube?

He didn't want to hurt anyone obviously or he would have done something genuinely dangerous.

lightsabers,esratzj,t3_c8nuii,1562220650.0,"I'm new to this sub and lightsaber builds in general, but it might be helpful for you as well as us to make your diagram a bit less messy. The less wires cross in the diagram, the easier it is to tell what goes to what terminal."
movies,es2nj62,t3_arp1as,1561531169.0,"This is by far one of my favorite guilty pleasure movies. Humans being with the ""walk in the woods"" intro is on my Playlist whenever I go off road. It gets my blood pumping. I've always loved big rain and thunder storms because of this movie.

It's not great, not terrible, but is makes me happy. (subtle chernobyl reference lol)

10/10 will watch every summer"

titanic,erf5x87,t3_c1qvxk,1560800769.0,"The stern sank because the double bottom held the stern and bow together. They only fully separated after the bow pulled the stern below the water line. Meaning the bulkheads at E deck were pulled under, and the compromised hull only made that flow of water worse. By the time the bow detached, the stern was mostly under.

Remember the dramatic breakup from the movie wasn't very accurate to the actual sinking. The stern only went vertical when it was already mostly submerged. Check out the 2012 simulation of the sinking. It's by far the most accurate description as to why the stern went down the way it did."
MechanicAdvice,er3mll7,t3_c02a4t,1560466917.0,"Your brake rotors are steel and if you live in a rainy climate or humid climate this will occur due to normal oxidation. Water creates an electrolyte and the iron interacts with dirt particles to create rust. Anything that can't be CRES or coated with corrosion risistant layers will do this.

Unfortunately auto parts need to be strong and cheap so we just use steel and replace the parts once they corrode too much.

TL;DR it's rust and is totally normal"
