But on a serious note, if we aren't willing to listen to scientist and experts on a virus that is minimal on its effects on healthy people, but is fatal to those with underlying health conditions. If anything worse comes around we're doomed. If the zombies come, America will just be like ""it's my right to go get a haircut/go to Applebee's despite zombies roaming the streets."
