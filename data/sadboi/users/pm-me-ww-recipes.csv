I’m morbidly obese and physically struggling and online and phone meetings are all I have. It’s a struggle to find a sponsor but I’m looking for someone who has struggled with obesity, which I believe to be a physical manifestation of MY illness - not pointing fingers at anyone, but this is the belief I’ve held.

In the past I’ve gotten angry at fellow Oa members. I didn’t understand some of them. It bothered me how different everyone was and I assumed I would relate more to them. I acted out in other ways because I was insecure (still am in some ways), immature, and unable to face how bad off I was.

weightwatchers,esjpzt1,t3_c7y4hg,1562038900.0,"I’m in that same age range (29) and I rarely talk about dieting and weight loss with people my age. I’m not exaggerating when I say I lost a good friend simply because she became a HAES and body positivity supporter and I joined WW. That was the last time I joined and I didn’t succeed because I was literally obsessed with what people thought. I would Google all the time, reading forums and Instagram posts about how diet culture was shameful. It messed with my head.

The truth is WW can be a restrictive diet if not approached with a good mindset, but that’s not what it is for me this time around. It’s true balance. I’m not obsessed with calories or nutrition. The points system helps me make informed decisions about foods. I have dessert and chips at the local Mexican restaurant. I don’t cut out anything I want and I’m happier and healthier than I’ve been in a long time.

A lot of women have struggled with wanting to lose weight and not being able to for so long that a resentment can set in. That’s where a lot of people in the HAES reside (no, not all). They have also likely experienced shame and of course we do live in a culture of facetune and shaming in general. People eventually reach a point where they want to pull away and not have to focus on that.

For me that leads to morbid obesity, and the place I want to be is more moderate. 

We all have got to understand that if we truly want to do something for ourselves, the benefits will outweigh what anyone says. If not, we can always cut people out. But my advice is to first let the results of hard work speak for itself"

I went through something similar with my mom last year. A few times, actually. She was sick with cancer and every visit to check the progress I felt dread. I expected the worst while everyone around me believed God would heal. I believed in God too but my anxiety caused me to constantly feel dread.

Sometimes it would be bad news. But most of the time it was good or neutral - nothing that would take away our hope. The doctors would always figure out a plan for the next step, and that’s what I’m sure they will do with your mother. Because regardless of the test results, your mother’s story does not end there.

I have never made it past step 3, and restarted the program many times. I feel differently this time. I’m coming back from a period of deep depression and suicidal thoughts. I was really hard on myself instead of trying to help myself. My perspective has changed and I am reaching out to my sponsor tomorrow. I know she’ll respond, isn’t that a joyful thing?

I think step one is difficult because it takes a level of honesty most addicts aren’t ready to face yet. It’s a rather profound step. I think it takes an incredible amount of courage and self reflection to come to the truth of being powerless. I myself am starting from square 1 and I even have difficulty with the concept. I want to be able to say I have control over my compulsion - but the proof is evident in my daily actions. 

I do believe I’ve had a change completely. I now realize OA is not about anything other than a disease of the mind. I have no food plan anymore, nothing off limits. I will track my food using a program that suits me, but not in the way I used to.
