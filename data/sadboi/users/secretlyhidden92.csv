Tulpas,ewftbxw,t1_ewft80j,1565367152.0,Yes I will send you a message.
Tulpas,ewftalc,t1_ewft76m,1565367135.0,I do have a lot of psychological help thanks.
Tulpas,ewfswu3,t1_ewfspe5,1565366950.0,I'm very undecided. I can see pros to having one but I'm a little bit nervous of some things.
Tulpas,ewfrmwa,t1_ewfqulj,1565366401.0,I dont think it is stuff that I'd ask myself on purpose to be honest. It is usually stuff that I find very....obvious...I guess is the word. Like why are you going over here? What are you doing that for? How long are you going to be? Can you please clarify why you're doing that? Is the type of questions so I thought maybe Tulpa from what I've been reading but it's also in my own voice and like barely audible so it's very confusing.

relationship_advice,evk7il0,t3_ck5ndw,1564576942.0,"If you are stressed at work or depressed or any other kind of mental things going on that could impact it. Take a break and focus on her. Don't use the pill unless you have to, it could become an expensive habit and might end up being permanent that you depend on it. Don't set times for sex either. If you get it up then start with foreplay and then go into it. Make sure you don't overthink things either. Try not to get upset if you can't keep it up....switch to getting her off with toys, your fingers or your tongue. I also suggest that you see a different doctor than the previous one and get an entirely full medical work up because maybe the doctor missed something, you never know. Good luck."

relationship_advice,eud2ytg,t1_eud2vn5,1563698517.0,Not a problem at all. You can do it!!
relationship_advice,eud2y4j,t3_cfwr3k,1563698488.0,"Could it be an old account? 
But seriously though....you're in a relationship from what you said. So man up and call it that or end it."
relationship_advice,eud2u7v,t1_eud2qos,1563698319.0,"Good idea. And if you need to, change your name on your social media accounts and change your email and phone number if you have to. Sometimes it takes extreme measures to get control of your life after a situation like that but it's worth it. Tell J what he did and that you wont stand for it and then block him everywhere. You got this girl!"
relationship_advice,eud2mzw,t1_eud2fq4,1563698013.0,"I get what you're going through. 
Block J and change all your contact info. Make sure he knows that you are blocking him and why. Tell him you didn't want any of that and you are upset and uncomfortable and want to be left alone. If he continues to bother you after that then its harassment and you can proceed with legal action. After you did all of that and drew clear lines and cut J off then go and talk to D. Tell him that you felt forced. Tell him as well that you have completely cut J off and if he continues to contact and badger you then you will go to police. It won't be easy but I think you can fix your relationship with D if you do it the right way and you'll have to fight hard but if you love him, it's worth it."
relationship_advice,eud2f4g,t3_cfwsiu,1563697683.0,"Yikes. You technically broke in. You better come clean so he can decide if he wants to involve the police. Also, please seek professional help because this is extremely stalker like and messed up. Sorry to be rude but you need to hear it."
relationship_advice,eud2aqx,t3_cfwsiy,1563697497.0,"Block J first of all, second come clean to D."
relationship_advice,eud22mf,t3_cfwt1r,1563697160.0,"If you want to end it then end it. If you want to be in it then make 100% sure you're following the consent laws wherever you're from. Other than the laws, don't worry what anyone else thinks as long as it is working."
relationship_advice,eu84u10,t3_cf8bmj,1563549728.0,"As much as it will suck, you need to leave. You fight all the time and he doesn't sound like he's really interested in being committed and faithful to you."
relationship_advice,eu84g0f,t3_cf8d4a,1563549492.0,"Pill is not 100% effective, you need to be using more than 1 form of birth control. Definitely take another test. 

Does your boyfriend not realize that by living with you and staying in a relationship with you and helping you if you're having a baby by him then he can't just ignore the baby? He's going to have to help you raise the baby. It won't be something he can just ignore. 

You seem like you're very levelheaded for your age by thinking through all of your options. Just keep in mind that it's your body, your choice."
relationship_advice,ets2i4x,t3_cd70p8,1563134902.0,He's not a mind reader. You should have been way more clear.
relationship_advice,ets261e,t3_cd76au,1563134659.0,Let her stay with her friends or at a shelter. Way too soon to move in together and having her rent off of you can make things really awkward.
relationship_advice,ets1cxb,t3_cd793q,1563134080.0,Doesn't sound like you want to be with him. If you have more negative feelings to him and the relationship than positive then let it go. I also have anxiety and attachment disorder but even I never get like that....
relationship_advice,etniyhn,t3_cck42f,1562988714.0,Yall are so young. You seem a more mature 18 than hers but you're both still only 18. Matching tattoos is a stupid idea even when you're older. But you probably shouldn't stick around someone who throws a tantrum because you won't get a matching tattoo with her.
relationship_advice,etnhpn8,t3_cckbsp,1562987605.0,Think long and hard about both options but make sure you don't keep her guessing long or she may leave you.

BPD,eticid5,t3_cbtmdv,1562845972.0,I feel that so much honestly. And I really thought I was alone until I saw this. Made me at least feel a tiny bit better.
BPD,eti8uzr,t1_eti6noh,1562842637.0,Thank you that makes so much sense.
BPD,eti8rts,t1_eti6jhn,1562842552.0,Thank you
BPD,eti8q02,t3_cbtmdv,1562842498.0,"Me too. It sucks. And no matter how hard I try, I cant stop it. Its getting harder to hide."
BPD,eti5ppr,t3_cbtmdv,1562839741.0,I haven't been officially diagnosed with it but it was pointed out to me that I do. Diagnosed with BPD in 2013.
BPD,eti1nfq,t3_cbt02t,1562835354.0,It could possibly be but it could also be your depression acting up. I'm not a doctor though. Definitely see one and think about therapy if you aren't already in it. You've already taken a big step by reaching out on here so go you!
BPD,eti18nh,t3_cbruwt,1562834736.0,"I'm a girl with BPD and I personally have never acted like that with anyone I've been with. Maybe I just don't have it as bad as her but she honestly sounds quite into games. Very hot and cold towards you. I'm not 100% sure because I'm not a doctor but it sounds to me like there's something different from BPD at play here and if she really does have BPD then it sounds extremely untreated. You might want to attempt to bring that up with her (yes it's a risk but you owe it to yourself to find out what's really going on) or you need to realize that you do not deserve to feel like that. BPD or not, nobody should act like that and make someone feel the way that you do. Yes, being with someone who has BPD can be a rollercoaster but the person with BPD needs to be doing the things they are supposed to do to try and work through their disorder to be in a healthy relationship (which is possible when you have BPD) but this girl clearly is not. Have the conversation about what she is doing for her treatment, if she's not treating it which it sounds like she may not be then you will not be able to have a good and healthy relationship with her. But don't force her into getting help. If she doesn't truly want it and it isn't her idea, it will not work. I hope you find some way to peace with or without her."
