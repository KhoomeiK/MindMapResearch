As a healer you have a view of the whole game and as you have a defensive ult, you can learn when to use it most effectively and how to keep track of it (gravs, earthshatter, etc).

I'm about to finish university and go into the workforce (or at least try to get a full-time job). My biggest fear is that I won't have time to do what I want. I love my video games, I'm a Twitch streamer for a hobby, and I just don't want to be tired all the time because I have to commit 40+ hours to a job I don't like. I like the consistency though. I'm a bartender now and I get 2 shifts a week, 10 hours each. It barely pays rent but I enjoy it and have enough time for everything else. 

My plan is to have a 9-5 part time and then freelance on the side. That way I can still balance everything and I won't feel as ""stuck"""

Holy shit this thread is weird. You were setting up the party. When there was a typo on the cake, you provided a solution that didn't involve your wife going back to the store, but she did it anyway.

You then asked your daughter, because it's HER birthday party, what she thinks is the most important, found some cute bags to put candy in, and the two of you did it together. Your wife might not have thought it was ""perfect"" or whatever, but guess what? IT'S NOT YOUR WIFE'S BIRTHDAY. IT'S YOUR DAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY, and if your daughter had a good time with her friends, what else matters?

At the end of the day you did what you could so your daughter could have a good time. Your wife overreacted but honestly I think it could be worth having a proper sit-down conversation with her when she calms down. But my dude you are NTA by far"
