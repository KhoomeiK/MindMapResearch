Make sure you have a way to deplete your opponent's armor. I know it doesn't seem like a lot, but especially on bosses, their armor can make most attacks negligible. My secondary weapon is usually one that is specialized to deplete armor, but otherwise, guns can be used to do the same thing, though less reliably.

Siora leaves to be reunited with the one she considers to be her soulmate. 

Now, this could mean that De Sardet is very much alive and well, probably continuing their work in New Serene and making it as much a paradise as they wanted. Siora simply travels from her village to New Serene to see De Sardet. 

Or. 

De Sardet is dead, and Siora is visiting their grave to be ""reunited"" with them. Same with Vasco or Kurt or whoever else speaks of De Sardet in the present tense after killing Constantin. 

Otherwise, I have no idea why they would have pulled a fake-out like that, directly evoking mirror characters and then symbolizing a joined death.

It could be that, once Gwyn returned his soul to the First Flame, it desired more, and began sapping the dark soul from humanity, creating the Darksign. 

I like it. It’s a brand new idea this far out past the launch of the game. Keep theorizing, I’d like to see where this theory goes"

dankmemes,f1kgekk,t1_f1hz5o5,1569535309.0,"Hey, history minor and history geek here. Just wanted to put some light in this topic. 

It’s 1945. The war had already ended in Africa and Europe, and the only Axis power left was Imperial Japan. Now, Japan had a strict culture of death before surrender, it was common for Japanese warriors to commit suicide instead of being captured by the enemy. The Pacific Theater of WWII was incredibly volatile because the Japanese fought with ruthless and sadistic tactics, like that of bonsai and kamikaze. All the while, America was having a hard time keeping their Japanese POW’s, as they would just leap off cliffs or impale themselves on their swords instead of giving the Japanese secrets to the Americans 

It should be noted that there wasn’t much fighting in Manchuria at this point. While the capture of Manchuria was the start of Japanese expansion into Asia, it was strangely left relatively unharmed in the ensuing conflict. Russia was far too preoccupied with the destruction of their cities in the west to be able to mobilize troops to fight the Japanese. At the same time, Japan never wanted to make an enemy of Russia. Their main target was the US, and they weren’t capable of fighting a war on two fronts. That all changed with the fall of Manchuria. 

Suddenly, Russia mobilized troops and basically took Manchuria overnight. All the while, America was on Japan’s doorstep. It wasn’t looking pretty for Japan, but they kept their pride all the while. A lot of it was because they believed their emperor was endowed by god to lead them, and they would follow him to their grave

America designed a plan for the invasion of Japan. They called it Operation Downfall. Now, I very much recommend that you look into this topic independently, because it is, to me, the most interesting part of WWII. 

X-Day would’ve been the name of the initial amphibious invasion of Japan’s southernmost island. Remember D-Day? The largest amphibious invasion in human history? 5,000 Allied casualties? Pretty bad, right? Well, try 100,000 Allied casualties in the initial invasion alone. Casualties in the hundreds of thousands, even up into the millions in the ensuing occupation. The particular beach chosen for the invasion was much better depended, both artificially and naturally, than Normandy. This plan would’ve extended the duration of the war a further 4 years thanks to the brutal and sadistic tactics used by Imperial Japan. It was decided that a total occupation of Japan was logistically impossible, and the plan was only to make it to Tokyo and depose the Emperor, toppling the government of Japan. 

Not only was this a big issue for the Allies, it was also never the plan of the Allies to depose the Japanese Emperor. The culture of Japan ran behind the Emperor alone, and getting rid of him only creates an incredibly hostile environment for those occupying the Japanese territory.  The only way to truly end the war was to make the Emperor surrender, because his decisions were followed by the country itself 

Following the death of President Franklin Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman was looking to end the war. Not only did he really not want to deal with something like Operation Downfall during his term, he didn’t want to drag America through four more years of brutal war. Thankfully, a group of scientists under FDR’s direction had been developing a weapon to be used in dire times. The atom bomb 

It should be stated that the decision to use the bomb wasn’t on a whim. It took weeks of deliberation and a lot of sweat and tears, but the bomb was finally slated for use. They only had two, and they carefully selected two prominent Japanese cities to drop the bombs on. Cities nowhere near Tokyo. And they were dropped. And they worked exactly as planned. The world stopped and everyone held their breath. Hundreds of thousands died in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This was the first, and the only time this weapon would be used on people. Never again would such a destructive and dangerous weapon he used on anyone. And it should never be used again, the destruction was unprecedented and terrible for everyone involved 

Japan’s Navy was reduced to ashes. It’s military capability and economy was crumbling under the weight of this costly war. America was raining hellfire on its south, and Russia was preparing for an invasion in the north. Either way, Japan has a choice to make. The Russians would storm their cities, destroy everything in sight, and kill the Emperor before they ever even thought about going home. The Russians hated the idea of a “divine ruler”, and would be sure to snuff out every aspect of the Emperor across Japan. Now, Japan also knew that the American desire was only to end the war, not to end Japan itself. However, they didn’t know how many bombs America had. All they knew that two of their cities had been wiped clean off the map, and they were afraid Tokyo would be next. It only makes sense that they would give into the Americans and let themselves be occupied briefly, if only to preserve their culture and faith. 

In all, the occupation of Japan was a brief one. The Emperor invited US general Douglas MacArthur to the Imperial Palace. One of my favorite photographs of all time was taken here, of the 6’0” Douglas MacArthur standing with the 5’5 Emperor Hirohito. A photograph taken in an attempt to show Japan that their Emperor wasn’t all that divine after all"
