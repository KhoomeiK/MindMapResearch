I had a rough child hood and by fourth grade wanted to kill myself due to bullying and I had plenty of family problems someone was always screaming in my house I wasn’t allowed to be loud or run around because my grandfather was sleeping and could not be woken my family had an old way of thinking in which men are more important than kids or women I didn’t hVe friends or anyone to play with I didn’t have siblings my mom has had depression for a long time she never played with me as a kid don’t get me wrong she took care of and fed me but she never played really the only things he did close too it was telling me stories at night when I was young she is a fantastic mother I love her so much but I was lonely as a kid my parents were divorced my dad tried to kidnap me once he has cause a lot of trauma I was sexually assaulted in pre-K by a kid my age and no one realized like the whole time no teacher realized it was in the classroom wtf so um I have issuies u can imagine I wasn’t allowed to go outside to play either because my mom was over protective and scared so I guess I do it to relive my childhood even though my regression is a secret from everyone but two of my friends one of which moved a long ass way away and who I miss a lot sorry it’s so long I just didn’t know if the issuies I have play I to it"

My poor mom however had a way worse time than me she watched her parents hit each other her brothers hit there mother it’s a whole mess her mom can be a nightmare to be around"
Empaths,fdd0ymb,t3_efws6m,1578290492.0,"Hello I’m 17 my family has a lot of interesting backgrounds let’s say Powers is the best way I can desc me and my mom are empaths and my grandmothers psychic for lack of better terms i was very I tune with things as a kid like saying the phone was ringing only for it to start ringing less than 3 mins later stuff like this 
Anyway I’ve lost most of it I doubt anything is ever lost for good but I think I’ve managed to block it out I have very bad anxiety and get panic attacks and get overwhelmed easily so I can’t handle that on top of it I’ve always had a hard time turning my empath side off it sucks especially when I’m around negative people it can be overwhelming and scary to be in crowds with this I’m sorry I sound so negative I guess I don’t get much of the good side of my empathy I had childhood trauma and stuff so eh whatever 
The point is I think the most important thing is not to be overbearing with him but let him know your there to catch him or to talk if he needs to and that he needs to learn to sort out what’s not his and dump it a good start is repeating to yourself these emotions are not mine so I don’t need to hold onto them kinda like clouds passing I probably don’t make any sense sry just let him know ur there to help and he doesn’t have to bottle everything that you will never look down on him for being emotional or think of him as less and that he can help people with his gift as long as he learns how to turn it off and drop things when it’s needed 
As a parent also I think k it’s important to understand if he is tired my powers drain me not to mention the stress of school social expectations ect he has a lot on his plate as a teen so he may be a little cranky I tend to snap at people when they get too much for me bc I haven’t learned to let go so much ...."
