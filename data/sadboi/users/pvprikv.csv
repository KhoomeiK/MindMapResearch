AskWomenOver30,fr1tj8m,t3_gm2fzk,1589825695.0,"in my experience, as a person who is *very* interested in sex and has experienced dead bedrooms in two relationships, it’s the guy. i’m okay with expressing what i want and what i like, i’m pretty much ready to go whenever. one boyfriend was more interested in watching porn than having sex and rarely touched me in a way that felt like he wanted me, and the other had a low libido and could joke with me and tease me to the point of it not being funny anymore and stepping into a cruel territory. he was a great guy, but i practically had to beg him to be nice to me. sometimes the emotional attachment wasn’t there and that started to really kill my desire to have sex with him."

firstimpression,fqdkh6y,t1_fqcngav,1589291562.0,"i love how thorough, yet completely inaccurate, all of this is. 

i wasn’t perceived as “attractive” until after highschool. in school i was a gangly, depressed emo kid (let’s be real, i still am) with a big nose who was constantly bullied, had few friends, and ended up in an abusive relationship.

i didn’t go to college because i did so poorly in school, but did find an amazing group of friends in my early twenties who completely changed my concept of what a friend could be. 

my jawline has never been my insecurity, always my nose, because after getting called a bird for so long during your developmental years how could that not get to you?

I’ve only ever had long term relationships, the idea of “dating” for the short term is strange to me, and all of those men (excluding the abusive one, of course) have been wonderful. I’m very lucky to have a great man now, in fact. 

I can’t draw a single thing to save my life, but i did find my niche in creating costumes and building props for the conventions i attend. 

my favorite scent is a gucci perfume, i keep a heater on in my room at all times, and yes, i do love a weekend to myself very much."

AmItheAsshole,fopcw27,t3_g8mxce,1587958346.0,"NTA!!! i used to be a house cleaner and when i went to people’s homes i wore oversized basketball shorts and my boyfriends big old t-shirts because i would get super warm while working. people were rarely home when i was there cleaning, but sometimes the woman of the house would show up close to when i finished. most of them were polite to me and said hi, some stayed to chat, some gave me a tip or offered me coffee. some of them barely acknowledged i was there so i’d quietly finish up and head out. at one point the woman whose business i was working for told me that she got a few complaints from some of these homeowners, saying that i was dressed inappropriately and that they would feel uncomfortable if their husband ever came home and saw me cleaning.

i was fucking baffled because i never wore makeup, my hair was always up in a bun, i was wearing old oversized clothes, and basically just looked like a sexless sweaty mess while i worked. i also have very small breasts and wore sports bras, so it’s not like you could see the shape of my body in the clothes. 

some women are just so insecure with themselves that even the idea of another woman in the vicinity of her husband will make them uncomfortable and irrational. it’s really sad."
