MaladaptiveDreaming,fpx8fhm,t3_gg2fac,1588977670.0,"Very negatively. Been daydreaming my entire youth away basically. Not even kidding, gonna hit 30 in a few years. It's definitely gotten worse during lockdown but I always have phases where I quite literally get stuck in my own head. Mostly because I've been looping in and out of depression mixed with social anxiety for over a decade now. 

I very much feel the same. It's kind of a double-edged sword, isn't it? MDD can help with the feeling of loneliness but it ultimately causes us to shut ourselves away from everyone even more.

A lot of people here feel like their memory has gotten worse, including me. People post questions about it very frequently here. I also have insomnia because of it from time to time.

It's hard to give tips on how to stop it in my opinion. Maladaptive daydreaming is definitely a coping mechanism. The thought of not having it anymore can be scary. I only recently had the courage to mention MDD to my therapist and I'm glad that she's taking it seriously. I'm still very reluctant when it comes to talking about details but I'm glad it's out in the open now.   
I'd recommend going to a therapist if you're not already seeing one, it's a huge and difficult step, but it can help to talk with someone about it who's in a neutral position."

He always watches her but he really couldn't see how sad she was when she sat next to him on the train back home? It's such a big thing he doesn't know about her.

And it was cute but also slightly odd to me when he visited all of Anne's places. Did he really know where the clubhouse was? Or that the cliff was important to her? Correct me when I'm wrong here. 

Again, I do support ""Shirbert"". Don't kill me please... I'm just  somewhat convinced that they won't be engaged by the end of the season. A couple? Yeah, maybe, hopefully! But engaged? Hmm...

grimm,f23fxy5,t3_d7rtb5,1569922585.0,"I'm about to finish season 6, too and so far I feel like Black Claw should've never had existed in the first place. They should have focused more on the Royal family, elaborate on them and give them some bite instead of just having them disappear. There was a lot of unused potential there.

I also disliked how they made Sean so easily manipulated by Rachel and Bonaparte (who I think was a boring villain). Sean's character was interesting and seeing him do a complete 180 after his politician friend died felt out of place. But I guess he'll come around again in the last minute? I know him wanting to be mayor/leader was somewhat teased when he had those magic coins, but he was possessed by them because of their dark power. The Black Claw storyline made it look like he only wanted to become mayor because a redhead winked at him and he saw a poster of himself lol.

The idea about Wesen wanting to rise is not bad per se but given how little time they were given with that subplot, they really should've just scratched it entirely.
I really believe they should have stuck with the Royals. Having the Royals try and gain control over everything is something I think would've fit better into the overall story of Grimm. It also could have given Sean a more satisfying character arc. Having him make bad decisions would've been more believable. It was mentioned that the King had a soft spot for Sean but we did not get to see them interact in person once! 

The Wesen Council was something I found to be very interesting during the first seasons. But seeing all of the representatives get killed so randomly felt almost comedic.
I'm not done watching the show yet but I already know that they'll not be mentioned again. I liked Alexander a lot and was sure he was going to make his way to Portland because of the way they showed him escape from the Black Claw members. But nothing ever happened after that. It's extremely disappointing.

The Grimm treasure should've also been explained better but since I have a couple of Episodes left to watch I hope there will be some closure at least.

I still love the show and I know the main reason there are so many loose ends is that the show was canceled. The writers tried their best, I'm sure of it. 
The last Episode I watched was S06E07 ""Blind Love"" and that shit was bloody brilliant!"

depression,ewj3uux,t3_cofkvs,1565460945.0,"I didn't even think about getting my driver's license until last year and luckily made it. I was 26 then. I was lucky and got a very nice and patient instructor that didn't mind that I never talked much because of my inabilty to small talk (at least I hope that he didn't mind). Is there an option/chance for you to get a different instructor? Before I decided doing my license I was afraid because I read a lot of stories from people who had horrible experiences with their instructors... This seems to be a really common problem, I'll never understand why people like your instructor think they're good at teaching. My first driving lesson was literally just us driving circles in an empty parking lot for 45 minutes so I could get the hang of the basics and get used to the car. I was then allowed to drive myself home but he was always calm and the first thing he told me was to ignore the cars behind me and just let them pass me if I was going too slow for them. I got honked at quite a few times during my first couple of lessons. 
I wish you all the best and I really believe that you can do it. I always believed that I'd never get my license which is why I waited so many years to even try it. And my first lessons were bad, too! You'll get better with time and it'll get easier to observe everything while your driving. Your driving instructor is the one at fault, she is in a teaching position and has to take into consideration that you're nervous and because of that less attentive. And she is making it worse by yelling at you - which is something she should be aware of! Again, I really think you should look for another instructor and if you don't have this option maybe you could try talking to her or her boss (if she has one) about it? Please don't let this experience discourage you. My instructor reassured me that many first driving-lessons are a mess because everyone is nervous!"

I still don't have my TLOU platinum because I don't enjoy the multiplayer. (Still missing Hunter+Firefly Journey)
Even though the vast majority of gamers is able to access multiplayer they shouldn't make it the ""norm"" and force us to play it when we want the plat.

Try to get a gold medal right away as often as possible. If you replay it later you have to play as Arthur/John with bad attributes and horses. If you try it right away you keep for example your leveled attributes and horse. Especially some of the Dead Eye related gold medals are impossible if you try them later (imo) because you'll only have a quarter of the Dead Eye available.   
I also used guides (example: [https://forum.psnprofiles.com/topic/67449-easiest-70-gold-medals/](https://forum.psnprofiles.com/topic/67449-easiest-70-gold-medals/)), got some help, watched youtube videos for reference and so on...

Or have Sarah ask Deac to get her some plants for her research every now and then - it's a shame that Sarah just disappears and everything she did got basically thrown out the window."
StrangerThings,et9oajp,t1_et9dwnq,1562601669.0,Yes! This doesn't sound too farfetched considering the bs other characters have survived in this show.
freefolk,es0ex7q,t3_c576xy,1561473678.0,Outstanding move
HPHogwartsMystery,erquznr,t3_c3di6l,1561152738.0,"Damn, I feel bad for you. I didn't care at all about this event but still managed to make it to #6 or #8 and got a few books.

Just a little heads up to everyone else: Please be aware that you are encouraging JC to keep this kind of format up if you spent money during these events. They won't feel the need to change anything if they're making enough money off of it."
thelastofus,erk0j78,t3_c2c1qz,1560952284.0,"Wow, congrats! Like some others, I'm also only missing the mp trophies. The firefly journey and hunter journey... I just can't get into it.  I screwed it up a few times and never touched it again. Too frustrating. I really hope they will separate the single player trophies from the multiplayer trophies in TLOU2. 
This is also one of my complaints about RDR2. They didn't separate the trophies there either."
PS4,equpgw3,t3_bzhj88,1560333445.0,"I‘m actually surprised how much it bothers me that Hawkeye is not in the game. I don‘t hate him and he‘s also not my favorite Avenger. For me he‘s the kind of character that kept everything balanced. When it comes to the whole group at least... Him not being in the game makes it feel incomplete. He‘s definitely missing.

Well... and I also always thought that stealth archers are a really popular class in rpg‘s."
harrypotter,eq04sfq,t3_bwo813,1559678246.0,This movie is as old as my nephew. What the heck..... this just feels wrong lmao
HPHogwartsMystery,epwtu1o,t3_bwbc8z,1559584529.0,"I also agree. I finished the quest a few hours ago but only because I didn't have to go to work and it was the weekend. 
The thing is... I don't believe much will change. As long as the overall feedback is mostly positive and enough people continue to buy gems, JamCity won't feel the need to change anything. As frustrating as it is. 😕"
PokemonGoFriends,eooitdy,t1_eooh0c5,1558739605.0,"Thank you for understanding! I actually downloaded the Game when it was first released. It was even worse back then, the only Pokemon I found while walking my dog were maybe 1 Pidgey and 2 Rattatas. 😂 
I took a long break after a while and just recently started playing again. There are still no PokeStops in my area but at least more Pokemon. 
I drive into the city once or twice a week for shopping and that's when I try to spin Pokestops to get new eggs and Pokeballs. Of course I also get Pokeballs from the weekly reward (I get the 25km one most of the time) but they're gone really quick.

I also have to say that I already received around 10 requests and I am quite shocked, haha. 😂 The gifts I had collected over the weeks are already gone. I absolutely did not expect this kind of support! I'm really happy. Thank you! 😊"
