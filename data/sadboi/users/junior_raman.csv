learnmath,fhpcwpj,t1_fhont6d,1581786764.0,"Thank you Sir for this thorough response. This clarifies a lot for me.  
 I read the proof for ""∅⊆A for any set A"" which goes like this;  
X ⊆ Y iff (∀k∈X)(k∈Y)  
∅ ⊆ A iff (∀k∈∅)(k∈A)  
since there is no element k that belongs to ∅ so ∅ ⊆ A is vacuously true.   
__________________________________  
Here in the book, the author says ""every 'x' in the universal set vacuously satisfies ⋂𝒜 = { x : x ∈ A for all A ∈ 𝒜 } for the case 𝒜 = {}""  
  
Did he use the same logic here like the proof for ∅⊆A? Then ⋂𝒜 would not be ∅ but contains x according to the universe chosen.  
___________________________________  
For ∪𝒜 when 𝒜={} he says, ""no element x satisfies the defining property"" hence ∪𝒜=∅  
But it's confusing cuz it appears to me ""x ∈ A for at least one A ∈ 𝒜"" should also be vacuously true."
learnmath,fhondtd,t1_fhomd0k,1581766151.0,"Thank you for detailed response. I thought every set contained empty set as it is a subset of all sets. Is it necessary to assume {} is not a member of given set unless stated?  


>In that part your book isn't talking about a collection of empty sets. The book is talking about an empty collection of sets.

  
Like A = { }, I think the definition for both union and Intersection must fail.  
Union of A = { x | x belongs to 'a' for atleast one 'a' in A }  
The statement ""There is atleast one 'a' in A"" but there is no member set in A.  
Intersection of A = { x | x belongs to 'a' for all  'a' in A }  
Again there is no member 'a' in A."
