Needing or wanting control is not the only reason that eating disorders develop, and overlooking that is ignorant if you’re discussing why eating disorders develop. A little ignorant for anyone really if you aren’t a professional."
EatingDisorders,f26wxoi,t3_dca606,1570025497.0,"One of my the main reasons my anorexia started in the first place was because it felt like my life was out of control, and I found something (my ed) to control. However, we all know that ed will start controlling you. I think I see where people are coming from when they say you’re generalizing, some peoples eds may have started for different reasons. But yes, I think there are plenty of people who had an ed start from controlling issues, myself being one of them."

EatingDisorders,f1lhcwl,t1_f1l7him,1569554838.0,"OP here, thank you for responding! The irritation is one of the biggest things I’m struggling with right now. It’s so exhausting to put so much effort into something challenging and not see any results. But ya know what they say about instant gratification blah blah blah lol. I know I’ll see results eventually and know it’s all worth it, but it’s been hard. Thank you for the support, I appreciate it :)"
