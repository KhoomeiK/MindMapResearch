SandersForPresident,fjhkw4g,t1_fjhb84a,1583350100.0,"22 here. I live in a similar town where the median home price is around $800,000 USD.  My stepdad bought a home here late eighties for 70k. Now it’s worth about 650k and he collects rent in the amount of $2200 every month. It’s insane. 

Addressing this will come with the dying off of the older generations because it will circulate property and money into a new generations’ hands. Hopefully having it so hard early in life will make us appreciate what we have later, not take it for granted. Not sit on our wealth. But who knows. 

As far as Bernie goes, he is very popular ages 17-44 but older than that it all goes to Biden (basically, simplified a bit). Biden also has a majority of the black vote which is a big part of our constituency. 

As far as advertising for Bernie, I haven’t seen a single advertisement (ad style, I still get texts and calls like every other candidate). It seems however that Bernie’s followers are a lot more passionate, they talk about him and his policies a lot and post about it on social media a lot. This helps bring him into the public eye. Once that happens, he is generally a good enough speaker that people who agree with his issues will jump on board after seeing a single rally. 

BUT 

Bernie is definitely a extreme swing in the opposite direction of trump, which I think is needed. But a lot of People seem to be scared of swinging too far the other way. That’s when they chose an establishment candidate like Biden who can bring us closer to a moderate baseline.
