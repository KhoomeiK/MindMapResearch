socialskills,fqejoam,t1_fqejgok,1589308668.0,Oh okay. I was raised very conservative and my parents and brother would always critizice me for petty stuff and manners. They made it seem like I didn't know what I was doing at all.

AskReddit,foygvia,t1_foygnh8,1588172294.0,"So to kind of distinguish between me and you, because I want to be clearly seen as a different category. The difference isn't obvious until I point it out and make it clear, to affirm my identity."
AskReddit,foyfvju,t3_ga4gjx,1588171781.0,"Okay, so I was on this language exchange website and taught a guy German while he taught me Arabic. My parents were kinda strict and I was a shy and awkward kid, so I had the habit of developing ""internet relationships"" with guys, over cam and so on. This guy wanted to meet me eventually when he came to visit in Germany . 

So one day, I prayed that I may tell the difference between someone who's a liar and someone who is genuine, because I had a weird feeling about him.

I swear the next day a girl hits me up and her message was essentially that he's a marriage scammer and has faked relationships/love with women before to get some money or advantages."
