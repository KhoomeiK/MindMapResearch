All those links should work, lemme know if they don't. This is hospitals that have experienced it, projections of how it will likely go and the cause and effect of when you lift the lockdown. Plus first hand accounts from medical staff, everything I discussed before. Hope that helps. 

And I genuinely wanna say this to you, this is not biowarfare, and if you follow stay at home advice this is nothing to panic about, if America had taken it seriously earlier, it would likely be over by now or under control like here in Australia or in South korea. South Korea experienced cases the exact same day as the US, but the US still hasn't flattened the curve, South Korea has. 

Stay safe and I'm.honestly begging you to listen to some reason, ignore the fucking conspiracy theories and just assume that, while this is not the black plague, it's still something of concern and you should address it that way."

The situations much more complicated because certain people in power have dealt with this so poorly what we're seeing is mixed messages, between that and the Chinese governments tendency to censor information and silence whistleblowers. This situation blew up in ways it never had to."

But the mortality rate is still evolving, you have unreported cases, and you have a lack of testing, some deaths arent reported as covid at all and rather than tesy everyone, theyre not.

This isnt the black plague or something, but it still presents dangers to the general public. Those numbers arent insane cause of social distancing, cause of the precautions put in place. But if these were to be lifted. You're essentially giving that up. Again, just look at the spike In cases following the protests.

I can give you first hand accounts from medical staff dealing with it and see what's being said from them. But this is right in front of you, forget the fucking bullshit conspiracies. If you can't see this I really don't know what to tell you. 

This virus is not the end of the world, it's not some grand conspiracy by Bill gates or WHO, many countries are already in recovery, but America is one of the countries that still hasn't hit their peak yet and given the ignorance of a minority of people (whixh, i don't mean to be presumptuous but you appear to be apart of this minority) it's only going to spread further."

Hospitals go to great lengths to keep infected from the general public but given the shortages, and reusing of PPE, it can't be absolutely promised. 

 As for your point about hospital capacity, not true but that's only sonewhat correct right now, and that's because of the lockdown. These numbers are all estimated to increase rapidly within the coming weeks. Given the blatant disregard for them, it'll only get worse, again....no suprise the cases spiked following the protests.

You seem to think this is only happening in NYC but it isnt. I can give u proof of that. 

Also the ""overreaction"" isn't one at all. We could say that here in Australia (even though it wasnt) you can't say that in America. You're already seeing a shortage of tests being done, a shortage of PPE so when it does hit, it'll be a lot worse than this. You seem to assume America's had the worst of it, it hasn't."

conspiracy,fo6xqqz,t1_fo6xap9,1587568681.0,"That's true, NYC is being hit particularly hard. But that's due to the enviroment, NYC is crowded far easier for it to spread rapidly there, as opposed to a state like Texas, a far more open enviroment. Less social contact.
Also not overwhelmed YET....It's already spreading across multiple states, Kentucky alone has just seen a massive spike in cases following......their protests.......(not a shocker there) (I'll also add, going off memory here, i believe it was Kentucky but it may be another state)

I would agree with your point about there being more staff and space available to deal with covid except that's not how it works. You can't take a dentist and suddenly expect them to be able to function in an isolation ward with an infectious disease. You also can't just repurpose a clinic for say, women's health into a covid treatment centre. You need ventilators, isolation wards, you need a lot more than just a vague medical space."

The problem is the symptoms CAN be deadly, it's not likely unless you're in the vulnerable demographic but it can still happen, on top of that hospitals being overloaded is an issue because due to the lack off PPE and due to the overload of patients, supplies run low and PPE is reused (which is incredibly dangerous) meaning patients can't be treated properly or what's already happening, some arent treated AT ALL!

There is a lot of real information coming out about this virus, the problem is I'm presuming you're from.america (Australian here) and it's very clear there's a growing narrative of misinformation and downplaying of this virus from your own president to certain parts of the American people. On top of this the whole situation is still evolving, there is still so much that's uncertain for medical professionals and scientists because...It's a new virus, they're trtrying to figure out how exactly it functions.

On top of this there's a growing distrust against certain governments and organisations (WHO) which contributes to this. 

The public misinformation plays a big part in this (imo) because how many fake, fear mongering articles and comments are being spewed out on the news or on social media right now? About unconfirmed facts or stories? Dozens.

I think the best thing any of us can do is try navigate our way through the lies and find factual information with credible sources and avoid ridiculous conspiracy theories."
