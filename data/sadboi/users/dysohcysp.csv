bipolar2,euqb39l,t3_ch250q,1563974716.0,"Alcohol and me had a great and unhealthy relationship since I was a teenager. It got really bad throughout college, I would self medicate with Xanax and go out drinking every night instead of going to class. It made my depression a lot worse but sociality was the most important thing to me when I was manic. I rapid cycle, so I was depressed when I woke up, encouraging my drinking (because I either wanted to forget that I had no idea what had happened to me the night before or the fact that I was failing all of my classes for the third semester in a row) and then when I was out w “friends” or getting ready to go out w “friends” I would be manic as all hell, drinking and doing drugs every single night. From Sunday - Sunday I was always day drinking and then partying at night. 
Drinking to excess brought me to a place I never want to return to. I put myself in situations I’m still too ashamed to admit to myself at times.  As you said, it exacerbated my bipolar tendencies. I’d often get violent, sloppy, and impulsive. I once kicked out a window of my 12th story NYC apartment and the police came. I have no recollection of the incident. I once woke up on the hallway floor of my college apartment building outside my friends apartment with only a t shirt on. No idea how I got home that night. No idea where my clothes had gone. Never found my phone or wallet or anything. I just had to accept it and move on. 
This is actually the period in my life where I met my boyfriend. He brought me back to earth, but it took 3 years of fighting. I’m still not sure how or why he put up with it all. 
It’s weird to think that it was only 3 years ago that I was drinking and taking Xanax every single night, blacking out every single night and never knowing what happened to me after 10pm. 
Since then I stopped drinking entirely for a few months and got help. It wasn’t easy. I went through a solid two years beforehand of trying to be stable without meds (I was undiagnosed until about 3 months ago) and I would crave the alcohol and drugs to continue to escape everything. 
Now I’m decently stable, won’t call it great or perfect by any means, but I’m working on it. The one thing that I can say my meds helped for sure is my impulsivity and self destructive behavior. I still get hypomanic and feel a little depressed sometimes, but for the first tome I feel like I might not completely ruin my life every day when I wake up in the morning.  
Side note: I do have co-morbid BPD so that drove me a lot as well."
relationships,eun6uys,t3_cgtncm,1563924989.0,"I say this often to my boyfriend because we spend literally every waking moment together- quality time is different than time. Just because you spend more tome together does not mean it’s quality time. Grocery store runs and Netflix nights are great and I’m not knocking it, I have a blast at Trader Joe’s w my man. But date nights are different. We try to go on one every week- and were fortunate that we can do that together. It’s quality time. Maybe try to spend more quality time, and not just time, together."

BPD,ervdrnm,t3_c46x3u,1561313137.0,"There are so many parts of my life that I don’t remember. I often hit a point where a switch flips and I completely change. Friend circles, attitude, the things I like, it’s like im an entirely different person. My meds are helping currently, I finally got help and just started them 6 weeks ago. I finally feel like I know who I am for the first time in 24 years and I’m remembering things for the first time ever."

bipolar2,erlg60e,t3_c2enoe,1560986305.0,"Mania isn’t happiness. 
I didn’t know what real happiness was until I went on meds (lamictal and buspar) and I can tell you it’s 100x better than Mania. I was scared my crazy would go away but others reassured me I’ll still be who I am, just a little more stable."
BPD,erleyo7,t3_c2j3zf,1560985405.0,Feeling actual happiness and not just mania for the first time in what feels like 23 years. Thankful for my medication and finally seeking help!!! My boyfriend had the most to do with it. He stayed with me through me being a shell of a person for two and a half years until I broke free.
bipolar2,erlei5i,t3_c2m5wo,1560985068.0,"I experience this but I also have comorbid bpd and bad anxiety. 
Sometimes just staring at myself in the mirror triggers my dissociation and (like in a movie) I can move but the person in the mirror won’t. It’s super strange to explain. The world doesn’t feel real, I don’t feel real, it all feels like a movie or, like you said, like I’m watching someone else speak while I’m outside of my body. I can tell I’m dissociating now when my arms start to feel like they’re floating and I know I’m not inside my head anymore."

depression,eoiccxa,t1_eogb2rc,1558616377.0,"I feel this exact way and I was just diagnosed with bipolar ii. But at the same time, me “trying to better myself” has included things like: me deciding in a day that I was going to move from New York City to South Carolina try to go back to the university that I failed out of 4 years ago. I see things clearly when I get hypomanic, a little too clearly, and then get over ambitious, think I can do everything to fix it perfectly and quickly, my emotions are all heightened so literally shit like scrolling through Pinterest and reading all the quotes makes me cry, and then a few days later I crash into a super deep depression where I won’t wanna get out of bed for days to weeks to months. I’m not entirely sure what my “normal” feels like but I’m hopeful to find it."
