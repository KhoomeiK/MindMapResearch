Just because it rained or did not rain the day before does not effect whether or not it will rain or not rain the next day.  Also, we are not looking for any type of order.  Usually you can find P by multiplying all probabilities.  In this case it is (.2)\^5 (.8)\^2 because we are looking for the probability that rain will occur 5 times and rain will not occur 2 times.  If their is any confusion about where .8 comes from it is 1-p to represent the probability that rain will not occur since their is only two options.

They might run into job issues in their college years but that would be about it.  Boy everybody does it or can do it but it is possible.

Homosexuality is normal and therefore their relationships should be normalized because then that gives other gay people growing up a sense of being normal.  While I agree that I’ve heard things about the pride parade that doesn’t sit well with me it still does not create gays.  It may raise awareness about gay people and so more people that identify as gay would be more likely to look for avenues where they know they can be themselves.  What it does lead to is young people experimenting and possibly finding things out about themselves they would not have otherwise and that is what young people should be doing.

If you are going to blame the pride parade you might as well blame gay characters, gay shows, gay love stories, and gay porn too but I could promise you that a gay kid was born that way and one way or another they would be sleeping with the same sex."
