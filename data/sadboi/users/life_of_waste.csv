ftm,fqz7kjr,t3_glq5mo,1589761534.0,"I'm passed a year on testosterone, through out it I've for the most part feel like not much has changed, maybe my voice is too high, am I sitting to feminine, am I hourglass shaped? Etc.

There are a lot of times where I don't feel like I'm passing. I also have a lot of people around me that say I do pass, sometimes I wonder if they think so because they've actually become accustomed to the fact I'm male and therefore don't notice the things that will get me misgendered. Which in fact is something amazing because they see me for who I am.

When I am feeling dysphoric or unsure about my ability to pass. I like to make photo and voice comparisons from before I started T to currently. When I see how much has changed it's a huge revelation for me. You don't notice changed when they happen so slowly, since you feel like it's all just the same as before.

If you sat down and watched every second of a tree grow you wouldn't notice it'd grown much until one day it grew so much you're wondering how you didn't notice, since you'd been watching it grow for so long. 

Most times you won't notice slow changes if you're watching for them all the time. I think that's why people around you are sure you pass, because they aren't looking for changes all the time. When they do look compared to the last time they had they might notice a big change. Where you've only seen small ones, because you check so often.

So in fact people around you are seeing you for who you are now, while you're still looking at who you used to be.

You might not feel like it right now, but your image is definitely changing. Sometimes you need a quick reminder of where you were to realize where you are now!"

I ironically depression takes away your ability to try. You have to catch yourself in one of the higher moments, even if it's a few minutes and try as hard as you fucking can. Put yourself in a position in those moments so that when you can't try, the things you need to do to get better are easier to do.

As for your situation, I believe you're judging yourself to harshly from what you've told me. Yes Loli porn is on a very thin line to being illegal, but you stopped yourself. Did you know 1% of the entire population is pedophiles? In fact it's in their genetics, it's not passed through parents or even they way you're carried throughout pregnancy. It's a dirty joke life plays on people, cursing them with that disgusting urge. It's a good thing there's a huge stigma around it, it ruins people's lives.

But you didn't let yourself get to that point, you are not a pedophile. Curiosity kills the Cat, you only took away one of its nine lives, haha. Don't let it get to you, life is fucked up. The fact you feel so guilty about it is enough suffering you have to go through for your actions. I think what you can do now is keep that as only a memory, not something that dictates your life, and use that to make a life you want to live, a life you're proud to live.

I guess what I'm trying to say is don't let people (even his parents) shit on him about it and let him know you support him in every way. It can be awkward saying sweet things like that, but it really means a lot to the people that receive those kinds of messages and stuff."

relationship_advice,fdvx0yk,t1_fdvwze0,1578752658.0,"Awesome, good luck!"
relationship_advice,fdvwux1,t1_fdvtquu,1578752593.0,Even if it's not to serious make sure you take respecting her seriously though!
relationship_advice,fdvwqfm,t1_fdvo0v4,1578752545.0,"Hmm it does sound pretty complicated, the only thing I can think of it to talk to her about it and make sure she's actually listening to what your saying, there has to be a reason for it that she's not telling you."
relationship_advice,fdvwhds,t1_fdvmpgu,1578752443.0,Yeah well it sounds like she's already doing that kind of thing. When people are apart and not talking it's only expected that they lose feelings. It definitely sounds like she doesn't love you anymore Nd it sounds like you're ready to move on. I hope the next person you meet treats you much better.
relationship_advice,fdvvi9u,t3_en7t4z,1578751990.0,"All good relationships have ups and downs, me and my best friend both call eachother out when we're doing stupid shit. If you can't tell him that he's been kinda stupid without fear your friendship will end it's not a good friendship and sounds like maybe he's been manipulating you and your just now realizing. He could have been a good friend before but people definitely change. Tell him how you feel about what he's been doing. If he's a good friend he'll care about his best friends concerns and reflect on himself if not he doesn't sound worth it to me."
relationship_advice,fdvuvwq,t3_en7fas,1578751697.0,"Just tell her what you told us in a more short simplified way, that does suck, I can see where your coming from and why you'd let it escalate that far, and I can also see why she's be kinda upset about it. 
Though if it was a meme account with no pictures of another dude I personally wouldn't call that catfishing, but that's just me so. I hope it goes well, I think you understanding you fucked up and apologizing is good enough, it was a mistake that you learned from and won't do again."
relationship_advice,fdvtm9a,t3_en7fqe,1578751321.0,"If you think you can date her and treat her well then yeah, you're young, obviously it shouldn't be too serious of a relationship, but if your being respectful then why not. In your last post yeah you did mention rating her out of 10 which isn't a good thing. But I like that you actually took responsibility, apologized and took the time to fix your post and try again, I think that's some good character."
relationship_advice,fdvr3ss,t3_en6b1l,1578750566.0,"Yeah I think if you're both aware of the issue and wanting to change it the next thing to do is act to change it. She should bring it up as something she wants to pay attention too in therapy. If you haven't shown any reason to not be trusted then she should trust you. Trust is a very important piece to a relationship or else it can get unhealthy. Part of being in love and having a relationship is trust, and I think it's a great feeling when you know you can trust someone, so I wish you guys luck"
relationship_advice,fdvqexw,t3_en6ses,1578750296.0,"Well this might seem a little underhanded, but message all your friends separately as ask if they know of anything you could to do get P4 to be okay with you and mention that you just want to be friends. If you're not saying anything rude about him and he's saying rude stuff about you in their chat your friends are gonna notice. But also don't be letting this guy step all over you, if he's saying rude shit to you let him know that you don't appreciate it. If he's being rude and ridiculous your friends should notice that and side with you, if they don't they probably aren't good friends to have in the first place."
relationship_advice,fdvohvr,t3_en77gr,1578749689.0,If you know where it's going and you'd rather not talk to him for fear of him getting so angry it'd scare you or could lead to mental/physical harm. I would suggest you find somewhere you can stay long enough to get a new place or just get a new place and then just move out. If it's your place and you would rather him leave get someone to help you get him to leave so he somewhat keeps his cool and if he doesn't that person can help you.
relationship_advice,fdvn4ue,t3_en7a8o,1578749300.0,"I think the best thing to do is bring up what you've mentioned on here and see what she has to say. This is a rather unique situation so I don't think many people will have a really good answer. If she's not willing to talk about stuff with you or tell you how she's feeling about it. Either something going on with her, maybe she's asexual? Or maybe your relationship isn't as good as you thought."
relationship_advice,fdvm1yn,t3_en797x,1578748864.0,"I'd definitely break it off, sounds like she just wants money from you. I wouldn't be surprised if she's cheating on you or even in another relationship. Though maybe I'm wrong, go with your gut feeling though, if you felt it important enough to ask this question is I'm assuming you already kinda know what the answer is."
relationship_advice,fdtig5a,t3_en2q54,1578717219.0,"Either she's not interested the same way or she has really bad social anxiety. Lots of times people with social anxiety will make plans and fall back on them when they start worrying. From my experience it's like pulling teeth to get the to even chat on the phone let along face time. 

Go with your gut feeling, if you think she's not interested at all move on, if you think it's social anxiety maybe take taking slow, don't keep asking to do really social things right away. It takes time for someone with social anxiety to open up to people."
ask,fdpr0to,t1_fdp8fhp,1578637220.0,That makes a lot of sense thank you!
