povertyfinance,fiky30s,t1_ficddya,1582489506.0,"I've been using tracfone for like 5 years now, it's really good and you can keep rationing texts and data to make them stretch. They have great sales on phones sometimes too, I got a $10 refurbished smartphone a couple years ago and it wasn't fancy but it kept me in contact with the world."
povertyfinance,fgh3fmy,t3_eyab89,1580775776.0,"Theres a lot of pressure in my area to support local coffee shops instead of going to Starbucks, but at least Starbucks has legible menus with well-known items and gives their people tons of training. I had a lavendar latte at some hipster shop a few months ago and it was so expensive and so bad :( I love checking out new places too but it's a disappointing experience more often than not"

CasualConversation,fbjtaqi,t1_fbilzjc,1576939678.0,"Oh gotcha. Well another thing you can look into is a tracfone or Walmart's pay-as-you-go phones. They have sales every so often and have holiday deals now. Much cheaper than a contract with a major carrier, and you can just use it on wifi so that you arent buying data every month.

Best of luck!!"
CasualConversation,fbilavu,t3_edl9k0,1576904517.0,"Loneliness won't give you a better future, listening to your needs and working to fill them will. Money is a need but so is social interaction. Are there bars or coffee shops near you with live music? I've made a lot of friends that way, maybe just two or three outings like that a month will help you connect with people. 

I hope I don't sound too harsh, I've gone through lonely phases  and I want to motivate you to find a way through!"

relationship_advice,fabhblc,t3_e8eug3,1575923232.0,"Since you've experienced depression and anxiety, it's easy to sympathize with other people who are also dealing with it. Please don't put it on yourself to fix him, though. You can't and it's going to take so much from you if you try. It also doesn't sound like he can handle a relationship at this point. If he's threatening to leave and won't take care of himself, I recommend parting ways, as much as it hurts."

relationships,ex5dcyg,t3_crdx8o,1566021522.0,"I think your crush on M is understandable, but if anything develops with him you want to start things off the right way. Before you reach out to him you should end things with your current boyfriend, and I would even recommend rebalancing on your own for a bit before diving into a new relationship. It's up to you how long that should be. If you still feel that attraction for M after you aren't weighed down by this relationship, for sure reach out! He sounds like a person worth being better friends with, romance or not."

ptsd,ewwjc9b,t3_cqb6o4,1565829319.0,"Definitely. When it acts up I drink a lot of bland tea and try to take probiotics but I'm forgetful. The best think I've tried is a teaspoonish of apple cider vinegar diluted in a full glass of water, it helps my stomach and my mood a lot for some reason"
