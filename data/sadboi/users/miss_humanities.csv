Rateme,ermo9e7,t3_c2p58l,1561031878.0,I like the beard and longer hair! Quite cute :)
Rateme,erjxiwh,t3_c2g6yf,1560949949.0,8/10. The first two pics are super cute!! I prefer the dark hair to the blonde that you have in one of your profiles and I think you’re hotter when you smile :)
bipolar2,erdygqu,t3_c1kvro,1560764982.0,I was taking seroquel for a while just for my sleep patterns on top of other medication... so yeah it’s the one med that helped me sleep; not surprising that you can’t sleep when you haven’t taken it
AustralianTeachers,erdtequ,t3_c1h3gq,1560756489.0,"Yep never had my grades looked at for a job as far as I know... prior experience, referees, and most importantly, how well you interview are what matter!"
bipolar,equueb6,t3_bzj3cw,1560335594.0,Omg this is me
AustralianTeachers,eqr4wth,t1_eqr450y,1560248374.0,"Yeah no I understand all that, I was mostly wondering if you usually have to do an interview if being offered permanency or if they just offer it when they want to? Again not sure if I’m wording this strangely!"
AustralianTeachers,eqr3asx,t1_eqr1pn2,1560245839.0,Yep job permanency!!!
