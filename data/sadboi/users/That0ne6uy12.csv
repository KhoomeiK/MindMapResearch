MaddenUltimateTeam,fkv3a7i,t3_fktno0,1584561129.0,"Unfortunately, I am a Bengals fan. üòÇ Favorite player for the longest time was kuechly over on the panthers. Sad to see that man go, but McCalister was probably my favorite card in MUT 20. Been saving, but it's a long road. As long as the bucs can protect brady, I think they'll do great. They had a good enough line to let Winston drop back for a good 6 seconds to go downfield, but brady gets rid of the ball quicker. We'll see how everything goes though! Looking forward to the next NFL season. So many players going to different places, so its gonna be wild!"

MaddenUltimateTeam,fbw1khv,t1_fbvpxhz,1577139209.0,"After looking, I have a follow up question. Would you recommend 88 Suggs, or 87 Guy as RE with a 3-4 formation? Suggs is much faster and almost better at everything except block shedding."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbvq8o5,t1_fbvpxhz,1577134492.0,"I think I might upgrade him and put him in over Pernell McPhee to be an outside rusher then, with Judon on the other side. Still gotta wait for all gauntlets to be over for Suggs to be used."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbvplng,t1_fbvp9yo,1577134230.0,"So even if the ovr is lower, a maxed Z. Smith might be better at RE. Got it. Thanks, appreciate it."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbvop60,t1_fbvnx40,1577133857.0,"Do you, by chance, know what their ovrs are when set as a RE? I currently have Ray Guy in at RE and with chems and everything, hes an 86 I think."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fb5loyc,t3_ebgag7,1576529926.0,This worked well last year as well. It seems to work real well on low to mid difficulties. All madden decides to be smart sometimes. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
DestinyTheGame,f7wbuj3,t3_dxm9g3,1574031764.0,"Anyone know what the ""something special"" that Eva Lavonte has for us is rumored to be? TWAB said that she has one last thing planned for us, and I've been itching to know. Help me know, oh bearer mine."
destiny2,f7lovnn,t3_dwtnd6,1573845159.0,"AFK Blueberries have become somewhat of a problem for a lot of Guardians lately. While some people would prefer an AFK player to ensure they can farm the kills they need, I can see how it could be frustrating for a newer player that either doesnt know the strike or needs a bit of help or a push in the right direction. 

In my honest opinion, I would like to see Bungie take action against those who start a strike/gambit match/crucible match/etc. just to get a few kills then leave. There are exceptions. I can understand the frustration of getting a strike done, only to see ""19/20 Grenade Ability Kills during strikes"". Nothing harsh though. Maybe just a strike cooldown timer for people who repeatedly abuse it.


      Keep grinding, Guardians!"
destiny2,f7lo8k1,t3_dwtqcg,1573844770.0,"Keep in mind, while getting the fated engram every week helps you fill in collections, it only gives you exotic items from the loot pool up to forsaken. Some guardians who have most exotics have been trying, and failing, to get Monte Carlo by buying it. It is not obtainable this way. 

     Keep grinding, Guardians!"

mentalillness,f0u0idf,t1_f0txs9q,1568932077.0,"Usually, people assume giving a name to one of my hallucinations would just give it power. However, I usually give a name or purpose to every one. It helps me put my insecurities, anxieties, paranoias, etc, in front of me so that I can combat them easier. It's easier to fight something that you know.

If you step into the ring with something that is strange, unreal, unearthly, and terrifying, it's very hard to win. But give that thing a face and a name, and you've got a shot. At least that's how it has partially worked for me."
