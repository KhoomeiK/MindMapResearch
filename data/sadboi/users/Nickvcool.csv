so the first passage is saying find a principle in order to *ground* your tasks. As soon as you've found your ground, everything else becomes decipherable. You've learned to decode (or recode) the rules of origami.

The second is not just talking about embracing errors, but really thinking about their necessity -- this is said in favor of criticism.
