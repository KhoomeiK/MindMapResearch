Advice,fomgh8d,t1_fomgbo6,1587889138.0,Of course it happened because of his actions though he went against the military rules and therefore got his pay cut temporarily. We don’t plan on getting exotic pets anytime soon this hobby I was talking about wasn’t the snake.
Advice,fomd90u,t1_fomd4qd,1587885875.0,We’re totally fine financially lol we’re going to have extra money coming in as well soon. I have a good amount of money in my bank account as well. We didn’t plan on getting the snake right now but later on. Again we’re fine financially and would be ready for it if we decided we wanted one right now.
Advice,fomcupz,t1_fomcpd9,1587885489.0,He’s financially stable we’re both in our early 20s we bought a home we both own cars. I’ve already done loads of research on it were fine financially we struggled a bit when he got his pay cut but he got it back up. I’ll be getting a job soon as well.
Advice,fomavqx,t1_fomat0q,1587883620.0,He wasn’t like this before I married him actually & I plan on getting a job once I move to where he is we’re currently living apart for many different reasons...for awhile it was financial because he got his pay cut.

Advice,fcnttid,t1_fcnt4jk,1577818283.0,I definitely will.. what hurts the most is he knows I was raped before I met him and then sexually assaulted a year after my rape by another guy. So when he started doing that I started freaking out inside thinking he was going to rape me. Never thought he’d ever do that to me and it’s devastating and it hurts.
Advice,fcntfpv,t1_fcnsmp4,1577818073.0,We’ve been married for almost 2 years it’ll be 2 years in February. It’s been going on for 2-3 months.. I’ve thought maybe it is because he feels like he owns me now but then I was unsure because he doesn’t show any other signs of it really. He does show signs of disrespect like when he tried to have sex with me the other day he was just accusing me of having sex with somebody else minutes before that because my back was hurting. My back was hurting because I have the flu my entire body ACHES. It was a huge throw off like you’re accusing me of having sex with somebody and getting my “back blown out” then kept trying time have sex with me and touching me minutes later even though I kept saying  stop?? It freaked me out!
Advice,fcnsiih,t1_fcns4jf,1577817580.0,He wasn’t like this at all actually! The first time we had sex was when we got engaged because we both wanted to wait. He made sure to ask me if I was sure before even doing anything so now that he’s doing this its shocking..
Advice,faon30c,t1_faomuxw,1576268033.0,I actually did apply to Walmart about a month ago. Haven’t heard back yet. I don’t want to go the GED route since I know I’d fail the math portion since I failed math every year I was in school. I decided to go the route of getting my actual high school diploma it’ll take longer though.
Advice,faoltct,t1_faolmr6,1576267219.0,"Exactly.. I’ve been trying my best to find work and he hasn’t even tried to help me. I’m left stressed the fuck out because I never have any money and I have a child to take care of. He doesn’t help out AT ALL financially with my son he’s never bought him clothes, shoes nothing. When we were living apart for awhile he never helped out with groceries. Nothing."
Advice,faol6nj,t1_faokzja,1576266819.0,Yeah I’ve been trying I believe it’s because I don’t have my diploma nor experience with work. It’s going to be tough since a lot of places here require diplomas. We don’t have diners here and I’ve actually tried to get a job in a regular restaurant and nothing. Never heard back.
Advice,faokyeu,t1_faokww9,1576266673.0,I have I’ve applied to so many different places
SexAddiction,f9lw4pm,t1_f9ltloc,1575433621.0,"I haven’t, I do feel a lot of guilt though for having these thoughts and in the past when I’ve cheated on other significant others because I needed sex.. I don’t know what to replace it with because no matter what I do it’s always on my mind. If I do get side tracked by something else and it goes away it always comes back once I stop doing that thing."
Stretched,f8qsuto,t1_f8qs9uc,1574723394.0,How was the pain ?
BPD,f83zgb8,t1_f83z7qx,1574225439.0,I know :( it’s hard to accept.. I always try to call him or FaceTime him.. he never calls or FaceTimes me!! I’d say the number of times he’s called me or FaceTimed me I can count on 2 of my hands and we’ve been together for 2 years. Today I tried to call him and he didn’t answer! It hurts and it makes me suspicious at times.
BPD,f83z46u,t1_f83z0nc,1574225134.0,I’ve told him to communicate better and explain things to me more but he’s not always the best at communication and it causes us to bump heads a lot. I try to FaceTime him or call him because to me it’s easier that way for both of us but he never answers.
serialkillers,f1ofycn,t3_dab6a3,1569644140.0,LOL!! This is something I would do 😂
BPD,f0ngi7q,t1_f0nfpt8,1568769471.0,after becoming self aware I realized I only meet 4 of the criteria of BPD. I’m a huge manipulator I will manipulate anybody if I want to or if I feel like I need to . I will use people for personal gain as well I can not like somebody but I can quickly put on an act just to get what I want from them. I lack empathy I don’t care if I hurt somebody at all I actually find it quite funny. I do have cognitive empathy I can understand I hurt the person but I don’t care and this is all the time. I’m also very reckless i don’t care about my safety or the safety of others if somebody so happens to be around me when I’m acting recklessly. A huge thing is I don’t fear being alone really I actually prefer it I hate people unless they have something I want. Like for example when my ex was leaving me I wasn’t scared of being alone and being without him I just didn’t want to lose those gifts and money I was getting. When I went in to the psychiatrists I’ve seen I never told them about this I never told them about my homicidal thoughts when I was only 9 or 10 and how I wanted to hurt innocent things I fantasized about it. I didn’t tell them a lot about me and I did lie I didn’t really think to much about it till I started realizing I don’t relate as much to BPD. I’m not an emotional person either I’m not sensitive I don’t have to many emotions besides anger I’m always angry. I can somewhat feel happy but it’s very rare a lot of the time i fake my emotions in the situations I’m in.
BPD,f0nfk09,t1_f0nfiux,1568768753.0, I’m going to be 20 in a few months
BPD,f0nf607,t1_f0neoim,1568768458.0,"ASPD, I had to really dig deep into my behavior and realized the things I was doing and why I was doing it that’s when it came to my realization I don’t think I have BPD . There are many symptoms i experience that to me aren’t BPD related at all ."
BPD,f08x2hz,t1_f08wl60,1568489592.0,Yeah I have cut ties as much as I possibly can but he always tries to manipulate me into feeling bad since we have a child. I keep our child away since to me he is dangerous and I think it’s best he isn’t around till he gets the proper help. He believes I should keep contact with him but I just don’t think it’s healthy for my BPD since I am in therapy I’m actually trying to get better.
BPD,f08wj8d,t1_f08weal,1568489309.0,Yup... I’ve told him he needs help but he always comes up with excuses. There’s always excuses .

BPD,eyou95c,t1_eyor2s5,1567283423.0,"Well I also lack empathy , I have cognitive empathy I can understand what they went through but I don’t care . I find other people’s pain funny especially if I’m the one putting them through it . Pretty sure I have another PD comorbid with my BPD because I don’t think this is a bpd thing haha ."

BPD,euc5175,t1_euc4vgg,1563665255.0,How would you bring this up to a psychiatrist without coming off like you’re self diagnosing . I don’t want to offend him or make him feel like he has no idea what he’s talking about . I’m seeing a psychiatrist Monday
BPD,eu9r2f8,t1_eu9ph4k,1563588310.0,that’s where I’m confused .. like most arguments if I’m totally just losing it after calming down I will feel guilty and honestly embarrassed as well . There are 2 people in particular where Id say they are in the black right now and I don’t care if I hurt their feelings in a argument because I don’t like them anymore ... and quite frankly I don’t want anything to do with them . I’m just trying to figure out if this is something others experience or if it’s just me
BPD,eu9ofri,t1_eu9ob59,1563586166.0,If you have somebody in the black you don’t want anything to do with them anymore at that point and time . Say you and this person got into a heated argument after you calm down would you feel guilty for the things you said and did to this person during the argument .

BPD,etv3ldk,t1_etv3a50,1563225610.0,I haven’t seen my therapist since before May because I don’t really feel as though she’s professional . When I was bringing up my hallucinations with her all she said was oh that’s scary !  I’m going to be seeing a new psychiatrist the 22nd and I’ll be finding a new therapist shortly after that
BPD,etv2i4z,t1_etv1r6z,1563224898.0,"Totally agree , I know it’s fucked up and I realize that and I feel bad for giving him this false hope . It just scares me being left with nothing cause that’s exactly what he’s going to do to me because if I don’t give him what he wants to he threatens to take everything . It also freaks me out being told I’m a narcissist it really scares me... I’m going to look into what are my options because I don’t want to keep going on like this ."
BPD,etumb4l,t1_etum015,1563215506.0,Yeah I am .. I’ve being depending on him for a long time I’ve always had to depend on somebody in my life financial wise especially right now since I don’t have anybody to watch my child and daycares really scare me because all the abuse that happens . So I’ve been a stay at home mom and my family don’t want to help me and I’m just really stressed out about everything . I’m going back to school it’ll be night time school once a week for about 3 hours so nobody will have to watch my son since he will be asleep (there will be somebody at the house obviously just Incase) in August so it’s going to make things a lot harder . I’ve applied for jobs so it’s not like I’m not trying but I haven’t heard anything back from all the jobs I’ve applied to !
