SuicideWatch,f48ndnq,t1_f48n461,1571443528.0,"Im 21, I've been struggling with depression for 1 year now, I found a girl who I love we've been happy and she has been helping me a lot. she's now depressed as well and cant help me, she wants to kill herself as well. my dad died when my mom was pregnant of me, since that 3 people of my family died. I cant stand it anymore its all I think about and I just need a gun really. I think its the only way I can do it. I missed my job today, probably getting fired as well, uni not going well as I've been missing most of my lectures. my mom is the only thing that keep s me from killing myself. shes the bravest person I know as she took care of me when my dad died, shes the best person and only person I love."
