ADHD,fj3yj1n,t1_fj3u08r,1582996139.0,Agreed! When I was first out of college I applied for a marketing job and they said I'd be better suited for a new marketing position they were creating for me. It ended up being cold calling customers for a referral program. Left after 4 months. Hated my life every day there.
AskReddit,fj1uzmm,t3_fayx6x,1582928377.0,"Crazy! Substitute teacher here. 4th graders...omg. Was paraproing for Junior Kindergarten but the students I was supposed to be with didn't show up. So, they moved me to a 4th grade class which had a substitute also! It was this poor girls first time teaching this age group so I basically spent the whole time taking control of the class.

Good day but good God are 4th graders insane. I now remember why I stick to K-2 and Middle school and up. 4th - 6th grade teachers, I commend you!"

socialanxiety,fix6nm7,t1_fix6j3f,1582813931.0,"Especially when the other person has to point out the awkwardness! No me gusta.

Edit: usually the other person says, ""I guess we're dancing! Hahahaaaaaahhdhei2hsfsgwy."""
socialanxiety,fix6dn3,t3_fac4yx,1582813744.0,Omg I hate when this happens! I usually just stop walking until the other person makes up their mind. I probably seem like a dick but I'm just anxious af.

socialanxiety,fiq4xg7,t3_f99ary,1582635218.0,I love the idea of no neighbors around! I hate small talk so the desert seems ideal!
Anxiety,fg6l18i,t1_fg69l2a,1580570769.0,"This is my second account. I completely forgot about it until I read your post. Thanks for the advice! I can totally relate to being scared of ""putting my anxiety on display to everyone I know"". I already feel so much more free!!! :)"
