I don't want to tell people what choices to make but I want them to think ahead. The real gatekeepers are the people who will assume because someone else regretted a choice means everyone will regret that same choice.

People also can't handle the fact that others have different experiences. Being trans is a medical experience for me and nothing else. I'm not trying to speak for everyone when I say that but I want my experience to be respected. I don't understand how someone can be trans without dysphoria, but sometimes people with medical issues get different symptoms. Sometimes people with migraines don't feel the pain but still see the aura, feel nausea and sensitivity to sound.

I also hate to say this but people these days are too sensitive. There are some people with some pretty incorrect views and when people tell them they are wrong they switch to low blows, name calling and bullying. They are incapable of intelligent debate, they can't handle facts or simply agree to disagree. They gotta throw a fit and make you feel afraid to have an opinion that's different from theirs and I'm getting pretty sick and tired of it. Breathe wrong or say the slightest wrong thing and then you are the devil. It's like a witch hunt."

To me any bigotry towards any group is a red flag that someone has some problems going on. The 'its only ok when we do it' mentality is completely wrong. Everyone should be held to the same standards.

Often times they want to bait you into some kind of race argument or call you a racist/nazi ect just so that they think they can control you with fear. This is not only wrong it's also crying wolf. Calling someone out for being a racist or nazi should only be done when that is a fact otherwise those words won't carry the same weight after too many false accusations.

If someone disagrees with another person the weakest forms of debates are personal attacks. During a debate it should be facts and sources. If people wanna copy paste dumbass memes because they can't have a discussion then they are just proving their own ignorance. If they were more educated maybe they would know that it should all come down to people's choices, behaviors and things that don't have to do with race."
