Psychosis,fq6gnqd,t1_fq6fvyl,1589131157.0,"It‚Äôs beyond lost sometimes. It‚Äôs feels as if my pre-psychosis self wasn‚Äôt real or is surely dead. I had a vibrant life before this. Now, I absolutely isolate. It‚Äôs hard to navigate with just me and my thoughts. 

And I struggle with the human connection issue too- I long for closeness but it all feels very dream-like. Or worse- paranoia sets in and it‚Äôs a dreadful & ominous feeling that everyone is working against me. It sounds silly writing it out but living it is horror. 

There are also moments of unique connection with nature and animals I had before but it‚Äôs more profound now. Maybe because I live outside...but nature and animals, plants, bugs- their kind of all that feels ‚Äúreal‚Äù; rather they are what ground me where as before, I think my relationships with people grounded me.

PROCEED WITH CAUTION!!!!!

I nearly escaped conservatorship by the skin of my teeth! I have been car dwelling 18 months so pm for any tips/questions/vent or advice. 

But know that you have other options. 

I suggest the  ‚Äòcrawl, walk- then run‚Äô approach. 

First, you are young and based on your description, would likely make a great candidate for help in various social programs. Yes, they take some legwork (persistent phone calls) and can feel arduous at times but it can help. Get a case worker if you can to help you navigate starting over. 

Second, get a clear understanding of the steps you‚Äôd need to take to get to where you want to be. Break them down as much as possible for you to accomplish them at your pace. 

You can do this alone- but support is the accelerated path- this I promise you! 

Keep up with whatever u need even if it‚Äôs for show- because u have a record and now deemed ‚Äòderanged‚Äô-you have to be on your best behavior. Easier said than done. 

Focus on crawling out of this situation your in and see what walking would look like. If you focus on running from where you are now, you may be the one whom falls and gets the most hurt (metaphorically, i hope this makes sense!) 

Crawl, walk, run. You got this!!"
schizophrenia,fp5tvf3,t1_fp5dvp4,1588339791.0,"Thank you for the lovely insight; soooo much you said was relatable! 

I have been homeless and living in my car for over a 18 months. It‚Äôs so easy to write people off now. I have survived so much on alone; especially with the pandemic- losing my place to shower...I‚Äôve had to become extra resourceful. I may be isolating but I am SAFE! No one is going to fuck with me! And that‚Äôs empowering! I don‚Äôt feel like I need people for much. Rather- I don‚Äôt want them for much is truer to say. 

You‚Äôre right about EVERY relationship i have suffering though; but relationships include all parties involved.

I was an only child till 12 of a narcissistic/BPD mom and isolating was my only option. Yes, this skill has been honed so well- it‚Äôs wrecked so much of my life- but it also has kept me alive. 

Yes- I push people away trying to help, often! Yes, I‚Äôm embarrassed, ashamed, lonely- feel like a burden. But I‚Äôm also not trying to burden anyone. Confuse them. Hurt myself. People (me included) don‚Äôt understand most mental illness- let alone something as stigmatized as schizophrenia. 

I don‚Äôt have answers to why this happened, kept happening or why now I seem ‚Äúoff‚Äù or ‚Äúa bit different‚Äù than I used to be. Yes, living this way changes you! Being hurt and losing trust in others changes you too! So do antipsychotics! 

There are-in my experienceS- people working at our psych wards that are sadistic, take pleasure out of hurting patients/making fun of them and genuinely suffer from so much of their own shit. This certainly didn‚Äôt help my situation. 

After the first episode of psychosis/hospitalization at age 30- I lost ALL hope in 99.9999% of all the relationships I had and any future oneS. At first- I didn‚Äôt isolate- I asked for help-I was open and messy! I had unfortunately moved to the other side of my country just a year before my first episode. So when I eventually found myself in the hospital- I was alone for days. It took my mother, 5-6 days to find out where I was and fly over to me. 

She was a nightmare. The hole thing still is the worst thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me.  I just wanted her to hug me, say it was going to be okay- and let me tell her all the things they had done to me before she arrived. 

This 

Is 
When 

My world

Ended

She didn‚Äôt believe me- didn‚Äôt want to even hear what I had to say!

She pushed me away first! She didn‚Äôt offer comfort- and this was a first! She had a face and look of disgust- yes, I wasn‚Äôt behaving ‚Äònormal‚Äô- and hadn‚Äôt seen her in many months. If we were another animal species, she would‚Äôve ripped of my head off and eaten it. That‚Äôs how I feel, truly. 

Instead, she said ‚Äúyou can let me go now‚Äù. And she fly back home. At my fucking lowest. I thought family is supposed to be there for you, despite my moms own issues- she provided for me the best she could growing up-she tried. But this time-she actively tried and avoided me. Even now, being homeless and asking for help- she is half in denial about how bad I‚Äôm struggling. 
‚Äî‚Äî

I found out, now at 35, that my mother went to visit my grandmother in a psych ward when she was younger, and it scarred her. Growing up and up until just a few months ago, I only knew that my grandmother suffered from alcoholism and 2 strokes before she was 35. I only have memories of her being in a senior care home and thought she lived they‚Äôre till she died because of the aforementioned. Her struggles weren‚Äôt revealed to me. 

My mom left out details that severed our relationship. She and I are both are very selfish- this is true. I guess seeing me in the same state of mind as her mother ‚Äúher words‚Äù made it to hard for her to deal with emotions so so she just shut me out. 

And I lost everything. Blew through my 401K, savings and maxed out my CC while being denied disability and not able to go back to work. It‚Äôs been such a lonely ride. My bf of 4 years at the time couldn‚Äôt take it and actually dropped me off at the ER during my second episode of psychosis. He left me there, alone for 28 days while fighting for my mind and body. 5150, 5250-No visitors- I called he said ‚Äúyou ah r to stay in there now‚Äù. No clothes of my own, not even underwear. He moved out of our place so when I was discharged I had nothing to come home to. Homeless again! Heartbroken, devastated- again. 

Before psychosis- I was living my best life- checking off fall the boxes: nice job that I enjoyed with a nice salary and benefits, my own money and my own place, freedom to come and go as I please- NEVER doubting my sanity or reality.  Traveling, artsy- all the stuffs. 

I walked through the world before with a golden parachute knowing if shit got bad- I could jump and my family would always be there for me- because that‚Äôs what family is for. 

Metaphorically- I jumped and had a crash landing. I expected everyone to come out in droves with helping hands. As things continue to decline, I thought Someone would reach out. 

Truth is- most people don‚Äôt know how bad it is. The others in my family doesn‚Äôt know because I cut them off. I was embarrassed the breakup and how he left me like that. Now I‚Äôm so deep in my messy existence I‚Äôm scared to take help. 

My uncle just found out and immediately offered for me to move I with him. I pushed him away too. 

I am getting older. Lonelier. Those that do care for me- will die and I‚Äôll be really alone. 

If I could go back-I‚Äòd do 1 million things different. If I could start from today-I‚Äôd repair as much as I could, be vulnerable and hope for the best. I‚Äôm trying but it feels wrong. I mostly battle with excepting that this is my life now and I will likely die a lonely old lady."

-I drove it off the installers lot (Rv mechanic) and he had a 25 amp fuse on it. It blew and I replaced it with a 50 amp. The wires/cables are very thick. I can‚Äôt remember right now, but some industry professional/high grade wires. Thick as my fingers.

Just take my garbage and recyclables- besides saving everything and going to the dump on the weekend, which I don‚Äôt do- I have to discard of my trash in someone else‚Äôs- which is illegal. Taking my trash to the mall or the gym works sometimes. This is only one tiny example...."

OP- I‚Äôm sorry your kind, compassionate nature has been taken for granted. I can appreciate your doubts and also the yearning for the love to grow between you,  and your family. That‚Äôs tough.

I tend to agree That even though there has been some recent changes there is a proven track record that drinking equals violence. It‚Äôs very dangerous getting involved with an addict. Especially one that is not in recovery. 

In my experience, someone with a drinking problem (in the way that you described) should avoid all alcohol. ‚ÄòJust beer‚Äô sounds like ‚Äòjust a problem‚Äô.

And because you‚Äôve invested so much of yourself into this person- I can appreciate your desire to make it work. 

Tough call. 

I am struggling in an abusive relationship much like you described. It‚Äôs good until it‚Äôs not. And it‚Äôs so good for some of the time, that you can completely forget the hurt they‚Äôve caused; worse, you justify it. 

I want to tell you to leave. To run away. And save yourself and your son any future heartache, or worse, death. Recognize the lack of love and respect your giving yourself in the hopes of him living up to what you deserve. 

But you didn‚Äôt ask for that. As for suggestions, AA for your husband, therapy for both of you (separately), and then a separate couples therapist you see together. instead, It is sometimes recommended to each have your own therapist and then meet with your respective therapist together as a group of four for a couples therapy. I‚Äôve never tried it though.

Best of luck to you. I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt have better advice"
