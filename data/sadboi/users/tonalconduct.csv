Psychosis,fqjdtgo,t1_fqj4qsq,1589408539.0,I was having hallucinations and hearing voices on top of depression. Plus I‚Äôm manic - from the bipolar side.
Psychosis,fqiy4gn,t3_gj2qmz,1589402467.0,"Yes. I was first diagnosed with ‚Äòunspecified psychosis.‚Äô Then some time flew by like a year, and the doctor considered my psychosis and diagnosed me as schizophrenic. Then I went to another mental hospital after an episode and they changed my diagnosis to schizoaffective bipolar type."
schizophrenia,fqaqqra,t3_ghqgqb,1589223649.0,I‚Äôm kinda all of the above. lol
Psychosis,fq75s3b,t3_ggqkit,1589142155.0,"Stress is a trigger.  I read a book called How Full Is Your Bucket? By Tom Rath that enlightened me. It really put into perspective the impact of my social relationships on my psyche. I also read a book called Happiness By Design by Paul Dolan that made me realize how something can make me happier than other things. I also practiced mindfulness, but still ended up on meds. The stress made me feel suicidal and delusional. I take Zoloft, Gabapentin, Hydroxyzine, and Latuda now which helps me."
Psychosis,fppvu2i,t3_gerrg0,1588810146.0,"I was on risperdal.  Now I take Latuda, and personally I‚Äôm glad my doctor put me on this drug. I actually feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for once. I‚Äôm not afraid of unraveling, like my mental health is going to spiral out of control. I also feel happier. 

If risperdal works for you, it might be the dosage. Your doctor could probably help you figure out the best solution."
IndieMusicFeedback,fp439yg,t3_gb2lng,1588290831.0,"Don't take the vocal tuning critiques too personal. They're all just jealous. You do have some good vocals though. I'll give you that much. There is a nice sound here, but it doesn't remind me of smashing pumpkins. Something else, this is a good song."
IndieMusicFeedback,fp42yvd,t3_gb2ip6,1588290658.0,"This has a nice mix and master. I like the vocal track. The synths are really cool, and they don't sound too loud or quiet. That goes for the other elements. Then the drums bring up the energy. Good job."
IndieMusicFeedback,fp42f4i,t3_gayrro,1588290353.0,This sounded cool. I was really into the acoustic stripped down sound. You might be able to pan the vocals a tad or raise the volume up a hair or EQ or process the vocals so they come through a tad bit clearer.
IndieMusicFeedback,fp4208d,t3_gb1ybq,1588290128.0,"This sounds like some metroid type music. It's kinda repetitive though, which isn't the most interesting. I do like the synth that kinda breaks up the monotony."
IndieMusicFeedback,fp41ifs,t3_gb05x9,1588289849.0,I liked the vocals. They remind me of my teenage years. The talking isn't as cool as the singing. It's hard to hear the lyrics clearly. The bass shouldn't go unnoticed because it adds a nice quality. The drums too are worth mentioning since they're groovy. Wish you did more singing because it sounds good.
IndieMusicFeedback,foorng6,t3_g8k5i2,1587945009.0,"Your vocals sound cool, as well as the instruments. Do you have more music? Respect the grind. Keep on covering music! This is good stuff."
IndieMusicFeedback,fooqx0e,t3_g8kmle,1587944565.0,"I don't completely understand the lyrics. However, the song sounds cool. I do think the production could be improved. I like how the music shifts with the bassline. That vocal panning towards the end was interesting. Keep it up!"
IndieMusicFeedback,foop6xx,t3_g8j3vk,1587943538.0,"When the drums and bass came in, I started to groove. This has a nice electronic sound, but something sounds lofi. Kinda sounds like Daft Punk."
IndieMusicFeedback,fooomf5,t3_g8l7cf,1587943200.0,"I would of liked to have heard a few more, ""when it's your turn""s. I thought that was going to be THE hook. Your guitar has a nice sound, and I can get into the vocals. Keep on grinding! Keep on evolving!"
IndieMusicFeedback,foone8e,t3_g8o5si,1587942469.0,"There's some room for improvement. The vocal layering was kinda off. Other than that though, you have a good sound. I actually liked your singing."
IndieMusicFeedback,folpzwq,t3_g7zie6,1587867764.0,You have a good sound! Best of luck in your endeavors. I enjoyed hearing you sing and the guitar has a pleasant sound. Those two were enough to impress me.
IndieMusicFeedback,folpfdo,t3_g7s6oe,1587867386.0,"This sounds amazing. :,)  


I really dig the production including the vocals. The hook makes it even better. All those little arps and synths and percussive sounds really sound cool together. Good job."
IndieMusicFeedback,folopqa,t3_g83rzc,1587866915.0,You did deliver on some R&B. Reminds me of MILO. He's got a song called metaphysics if you'd like to surf dat. This could sound better if the vocals were produced clearer. Maybe add some layers and adlibs.
IndieMusicFeedback,folo3bb,t3_g81efi,1587866505.0,"I'm really into electronic music, so I feel like the demographic. The song kinda skips in a way that sounds messed up. I really enjoyed how weird the track gets halfway through the track. Kinda wish there was a computer shut down sound in there. I love the sound design. That all fits together."
IndieMusicFeedback,folnpau,t3_g7yy15,1587866250.0,"This does sound like imitation. Honestly, don't let anyone stop you from producing this type of music. It's still kinda cool. The rap artist isn't as clean as the singing, but that might be a mastering problem. It sounds better in my headphones. I wish the music was mixed better though, like more dynamic. That goes for the composition as well."
IndieMusicFeedback,fognctt,t3_g6yzre,1587754756.0,"The vocal EQ is kinda weird, and the delivery sounds like it needs work. I like the hip-hop instrumental though. The hook is cool. There's something weird also about the bass. Keep on grinding though. Hope this helps."
IndieMusicFeedback,fogm9ng,t3_g7bce3,1587754391.0,I enjoyed the vocals. The harmonies sound really nice. I like how the drums are leveled. The EQ is kinda warm and saturated. Good stuff man. Sounds original.
IndieMusicFeedback,foglmn3,t3_g72nuu,1587754168.0,"Cool song, and the MV is lol. The bassline stands out to me, and the levels of the drums. Your voice is perfect for this kinda thing. The lyrics are interesting and kinda make me wonder there true meaning."
IndieMusicFeedback,fogkhjh,t3_g787o7,1587753713.0,"It's kinda brief. I enjoyed the spoken word, poetic-ness of the song-like piece. You're certainly creative in my book. I think with more instrumentation and with the right mixing and mastering the impact could be more evocative and deep."
IndieMusicFeedback,fogjtqz,t3_g7d1t8,1587753476.0,"I like the instrumentation, and the vocals sound good too. I might experiment more with the levels, panning, and EQs in the mix. The drums are kinda quiet. I like how the vocals sound clear though. They might be able to sound more front and center."
IndieMusicFeedback,fodu5pb,t1_fodu08y,1587690183.0,Sure.
IndieMusicFeedback,fodsiu6,t1_fodqf94,1587689316.0,"I haven‚Äôt given much thought to LUFS. I usually master to zero so there‚Äôs no distortion or clipping. I‚Äôll play that on different devices to determine the right levels. Usually I‚Äôll determine what‚Äôs the loudest and quietest while mixing. 

As far as the Owl City instrumentation and sound design, I‚Äôve played around with midi controllers and VSTs. I‚Äôd connect them and have fun designing sounds."
IndieMusicFeedback,fodqdqs,t3_g6uiex,1587688147.0,I really enjoyed the song. The vocals are interesting and captivating. Your song is good and maybe even perfect. üëå
IndieMusicFeedback,fo8jx95,t3_g611xb,1587598007.0,"The music video is my kind of cool, and the song is really good. I'm not usually into this genre and tonality, but I was totally listening to that song. Awesome!"
IndieMusicFeedback,fo8j83p,t3_g67dpo,1587597615.0,"The keyboard has a warmth that's pleasant, and those higher tones are lovely. The drum pattern is kinda lackluster. I'd work on the mix too so there's more width the the stereo image. Not bad though. Keep at it."
IndieMusicFeedback,fo8imqv,t3_g68c4o,1587597283.0,"The guitar shredding is very interesting. Around 1:14 and 1:46 there's a shift that sounds cool. The drums could be reworked to sound better, like the snare and kick are kind of quiet. Also, maybe a little EQ so each instrument has some space."
IndieMusicFeedback,fnjxvi4,t3_g1rv9a,1587009608.0,"The vocals are rad, and the intro is super cool. I love how it starts out acoustic and changes up to a more rock instrumental. The song changes up too so it's not too repetitive."

IndieMusicFeedback,fnbnadz,t1_fn95k1b,1586818585.0,I played the guitar and recorded myself.
IndieMusicFeedback,fnbn22x,t1_fn9464i,1586818467.0,I didn't plan on adding more parts.
IndieMusicFeedback,fn8ff5j,t3_g07y0w,1586740426.0,"Sounds like something could be compressed because the loudest parts of the song are way too loud compared to the quieter parts.  Maybe even mix the loudest parts differently. The vocals are really good, and I like the song. Great song!"
IndieMusicFeedback,fn81s02,t3_fzw3id,1586732104.0,"I'd work on the production. Everything else sounds kinda perfect. The vocals are interesting, but quiet at times. Reminds me of Modest Mouse."
IndieMusicFeedback,fn80h0w,t3_fzw7i5,1586731342.0,Kinda reminds me of Unicorn Kid. I like the melody and the sound design. I like the composition. Maybe add more harmonies and play around with the melody. You did a good job.
IndieMusicFeedback,fn7nyo7,t3_g03i68,1586724125.0,"The instrumentation is really indie in the best way passible. You did a great job, and I like how the song changes up. I might of referenced the track like A/B style."
IndieMusicFeedback,fn7msec,t3_fzzl3y,1586723452.0,You have a wonderful pitch. This song reminds me of Secondhand Serenade which is a compliment. I'd also love to hear this song produced.
IndieMusicFeedback,fn7m1ad,t3_fzy5u2,1586723023.0,"Very calming and relaxing. The composition is very good. Maybe EQ the piece so the lows sound a tad bit warmer or louder. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the listen."
IndieMusicFeedback,fn5f3ps,t3_fz8kvl,1586663206.0,"The vocals seem a tad bit loud. Mixing the track differently could help the guitar and vocals sound better together. Everything kinda sounds in the middle, which is sad because the song isn't bad. I like the vibe and even the vocals."
IndieMusicFeedback,fn5emut,t3_fziw91,1586662864.0,"The instrumental is okay, and the vocals sound amazing. Does make me want to dance. The mix could be improved. Good job."
IndieMusicFeedback,fn5dvgc,t3_fzjqoy,1586662307.0,I love this song. Seems like your experimenting has worked. I can't even describe what I like about this song. Pretty much everything including the breakdown.
IndieMusicFeedback,fn27osw,t3_fyqowd,1586580167.0,"The guitar sounds awesome, and the instrumentation is kinda neat. I like the song just the way it is. The lyrics have a cool originality to them. Sounds like an anthem or something."
IndieMusicFeedback,fn270ny,t3_fyt8lh,1586579624.0,"The vocals sound a little pitchy, but they remind me of guccihighwaters. Keep on practicing your craft and working on your sound because this kind of bumps. I like the emo vibes."
IndieMusicFeedback,fn26ks2,t3_fyw5b1,1586579258.0,Sounds green to me. There might be some hints of purple and  yellow. I can kinda hear the whole rainbow.
IndieMusicFeedback,fn1zpdg,t3_fygvib,1586574082.0,"At first, I was like this is too weird. Then I was really mesmerized. Kinda made my night in an entertaining way. Felt kinda hypnotizing and stuff. The music itself is evocative, and the visualizer is captivating."
IndieMusicFeedback,fn1ywue,t3_fyp7qh,1586573512.0,I like the aesthetic. The lyrics are kinda weird. You have some potential though. Stay creative and keep on creating art. You're a good artist.
IndieMusicFeedback,fn1xunw,t3_fyiijl,1586572749.0,You have a wonderful song and did a good job of producing the track. The vibe is really cool like subjectively. I'd love to hear more.
IndieMusicFeedback,fmzc4zk,t3_fy04t5,1586514851.0,"Your song is catchy. I really like the vocals. They have a nice rhythm and melody. The drums and are a little repetitive, but I like the variation in the track. The prevailing tone is quite interesting and makes for a lovely listen."
IndieMusicFeedback,fmzbze3,t3_fy24kw,1586514663.0,"The bass sounds warm, and the instrumentation makes for a chill listen. The drums have a nice hypnotic rhythm to them, while the synths are playing some melodic pitches."
IndieMusicFeedback,fmzbasw,t3_fy5664,1586513855.0,"I really enjoyed how the intro started in the lower frequencies. That weird riser sounds like bubbles. This is some kind of futuristic music. The melody that comes in midway has a nice rhythm. I'd work on the sound design to create a better atmosphere or sentiment. If you have the project file still, continue to make improvements. Experiment and play around until something starts to resonate with the audience.

Also the drums seemed underutilized."

IndieMusicFeedback,feirjgw,t3_ep4h4c,1579145400.0,The intro got my attention. I really liked that sound. The rest of the song sounded like a build up to another song. I don't listen to enough synthwave.
IndieMusicFeedback,feir605,t3_ep2xmf,1579145140.0,"Wow! I listened to your song again because I actually was entranced. First I was like the visuals are a hook, but the music put me in a trance."

IndieMusicFeedback,fe9e2cf,t3_eo2ca4,1578936711.0,"The samples weren‚Äôt my favorite. I feel like you nailed the ‚Äúbeat‚Äù though. This isn‚Äôt my genre, so take that into consideration. As a listener, there are more listenable beats. Keep practicing and grinding though. You could probably make a super dope beat."
IndieMusicFeedback,fe9d4wk,t3_enys8g,1578936483.0,I don‚Äôt have tons of feedback for this music video. Seems like you have the right ideas. Your song and music video were both cool.
IndieMusicFeedback,fe9c52y,t3_eo2g89,1578936247.0,"The autotune sounds off. I like the song, but the lyrics sound off. The graphic is spot on. That‚Äôs just my opinion. As a producer, I think the track needs to be a tad bit more original. I don‚Äôt hate the song. I‚Äôm just giving feedback."
IndieMusicFeedback,fcc6e7j,t1_fcc35hr,1577594931.0,"you wanted to hear the track change from radio to clean?

IndieMusicFeedback,fcb2wf7,t3_egv3vl,1577581601.0,I really like the building blocks of this song. The intro to be specific. The second part fails in comparison as the song stands. There's a real live experience in the song. Keep that up... Some of the instruments could be switched for better sound design. I'm somewhat impressed. I want to be really impressed though.
IndieMusicFeedback,fcb2fza,t3_egw801,1577581420.0,I listened to the Spotify clip. I'm expecting more from musicians these days. I love listening to music.
IndieMusicFeedback,fcb25z0,t3_egs1eq,1577581278.0,Did you produce the intro using vsts or samples? How did you get that intro sounding warped. I really like the guitar. Do you play guitar? Did you sample the guitar? Do you make tutorials?
IndieMusicFeedback,f9kehxz,t3_e5g7zl,1575398762.0,"This is super nostalgic for some reason. On that note, you sound good. Keep on practicing! Don‚Äôt over complicate the song. Focus on the sound and make improvements. Your voice has a nice timbre."

IndieMusicFeedback,f7u0bm1,t3_dxgz20,1574009341.0,"What reverb were you using? The vocal is loud and confident. This is cool for an acoustic song, and the singer hits some good tones. I want the song to blend lofi and clarity in production. Kinda sounds country and old school. I‚Äôd like a more modern production. Nonetheless, good work!"
IndieMusicFeedback,f7tz4ry,t3_dxjdc2,1574009024.0,"What DAW do you compose in? The lead synth sounds amazing, the bass has a BA sound, and the guitar adds to the vibe. Even though the track fades out, I still dig the overall sound and how each instrument blends with the others."
IndieMusicFeedback,f7ty13x,t3_dxnykg,1574008773.0,"Did you program the drums yourself? The bass sounds so good. Surprisingly not a bad mix. I like the volume levels.

IndieMusicFeedback,f773qi9,t3_dumea1,1573443127.0,This is awesome!! I‚Äôd love to do vocals on a track like this. The song needs some touching up like the bass quality. And the samples could be EQ‚Äôd better. But the song is cool.
