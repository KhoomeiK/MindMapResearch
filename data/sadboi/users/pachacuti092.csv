Tulane,fmtuo8o,t3_fwzi3i,1586379317.0,Well I got an honors scholarship and you may get a stipend or grant to do research if you stick with the program.
Tulane,fmtuhhg,t3_fx7vae,1586379224.0,I’m a guy and I’m not too involved in Greek life because I’m more on the multicultural side of things but I think you’ll honestly be fine and it honestly depends on which dorm you are in. I was in the honors dorm and from my experience everyone seems to get along just fine and from what I saw the most social girls we’re actually the ones who would be considered “chubby” but it honestly depends. I don’t think it will be a huge issue but I don’t know too much about Greek life here.

mentalhealth,fllu354,t3_fplncz,1585267757.0,Yeah I have PDD and autism and I’m socially awkward so for my first couple years of college I felt like that. It all comes with practice and experience and the more you put urself out there the better it gets. In all honesty if you come off as chill and not too self-conscious then you’ll get better.

He’s a good professor and you’ll learn a lot from him but his TA is quite literally one of the most evil ppl alive. Although he curves the most the curve is based on standard deviation and at the end only 2-3 ppl in my class got an A. I had him for orgo 1 and it was one of the hardest experiences I’ve ever had to deal with. Also his tests are the hardest too

AskAnAmerican,eys1047,t3_cydwtb,1567383965.0,"As much as I dislike politicians and certain systems of this country and it’s history, what I like about it is the freedom and opportunities and the spirit of its people. Even though throughout history America hasn’t always been a good place for a lot of ppl (especially black ppl and women etc), it’s people have always fought for it to be better. Instead of America love it or leave it or America I hate it, it should be America let’s make it a better place for everyone and fight for it. Whether it was women gaining the right to vote or African Americans and civil rights, America has been a struggle but as people came together, America worked to right it’s wrong and make it a better place for all people. 

TLDr if there’s something you feel isn’t right about America, instead of leaving stay and fight to make it a better place"
