DMAcademy,fkvg9rl,t1_fkupc7b,1584568623.0,Thank you. Great idea.
DMAcademy,fkvfum0,t1_fkud1gg,1584568379.0,"They did response a few times in character, but he just doesn't get the hint. I think he dismissed it as battering between comrades or something. Then when they confronted him irl, he was just shrugging it off as not being so dramatic as we were making it out to be. He's simply OBLIVIOUS to any critic."
DMAcademy,fkuodhi,t1_fkul4qv,1584553149.0,"Yeah, I talked to the others and they talked to him too. He's really really immature, but he's not maleficent at all, that's why it's hard for me to just kick him.

Besides the taxidermy thing, there's constant flirting with NPCs, trying to steal everything (even from other players), always going the extra mile in describing unnecessary cruelty when dealing blows (which I'm not opposed to, but it's always the same ""I'm cutting his eyes out"" bullcrap).

To be frank, its entertaining to me, but I can tell that the others are getting really irritated from sessions to session."
dndmemes,fkb8910,t1_fkb6i5m,1584028087.0,"He is really into DnD, but here in Bosnia there are not many DMs (I am the first one I personally know about who took it serious and who is going through with it). 

Standard campaign, really, I'm running. But, it's in high demand."
dndmemes,fkb7pqv,t3_fh26dj,1584027784.0,"OK. It's Thursday and he did, indeed, quit his job. I assume, of course, that it has to do with something besides making the session, but the way he framed it (and went through with it) is hilarious.

Should I give inspiration for this? Hahahah"
AssCredit,fh5hekc,t3_eymuxu,1581289053.0,I always thought of the number 2 as being the basic bitch amongst all numbers. Since I was a kid I looked at 2 with a disdain I never felt for any other number in existence. The feeling prevails to this day.
