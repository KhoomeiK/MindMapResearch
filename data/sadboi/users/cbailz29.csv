Anxiety,fp0mejj,t3_gaarcc,1588212206.0,"My anxiety exacbates a chronic injury, which sends me into a lovely spiral of pain and anxiety making each other worse. Luckily, since I started medication for the less physical anxiety symptoms, my injury has felt better than it has in ages and I am doing much better physically and mentally! Here's hoping you find something that picks you up, and you get to enjoy some spiraling positivity :)"
Anxiety,fp0lymi,t1_foyumlt,1588211947.0,"I relate to you so much! I have mostly physical symptoms with my anxiety and depression. My thoughts are completely self aware and I can rationalize my feelings, but it's almost like my brain and body are in disagreement and my brain is trying to explain why my body is freaking out. It was so hard for me to explain, but I guess body does dumb anxious crap sometimes"

Anxiety,fj6eto4,t1_fj5qnin,1583069606.0,There are apparently a few different types. The second one I got has held out but it is a little squishier
Anxiety,fj4ztic,t1_fj4wiy2,1583020850.0,Dentists are the true chaotic good of the medical profession
Anxiety,fj4ublo,t1_fj403xm,1583017072.0,I got a mouth guard to help with this. Chewed through it. My dentist is the first person to diagnose me with anxiety ðŸ˜…

Anxiety,fiucicj,t1_fiu8vci,1582738866.0,Yes I was about to post the same! I drink a pot of coffee a day (yeah I know) and this was the only thing that gets me to cut back on the caffeine

AskReddit,fi26qfl,t1_fi24siy,1582072754.0,"Speaking from experience, a good number of mental health professionals also specialize chronic pain patients. It was one of the first referrals I got when I got diagnosed with some pretty icky back shit, and has been helpful so far. Hope you get the help you need!"

Anxiety,fhr02ms,t3_f4i67t,1581814403.0,"One thing that helped me (plus therapy and medication for anxiety overall) was keeping a little notepad on my night stand and jotting down any invasive thoughts or tasks hanging over me keeping me up. Originally tried melatonin, which will get me to fall asleep, but the nightmares I get when I take it end up keeping me awake for most of the night anyway. Hope you find something that works for you!"
Anxiety,fhcggqj,t1_fhcg0gt,1581462585.0,"That is exactly how I felt. I definitely wasnt even sure if my feelings ""counted"" or were worth medical attention. They have diagnostic tools and treat it just like any other illness. It was a huge relief for me, I am hoping you have the same positive experience! My second meeting with my therapist is tomorrow :)"
unpopularopinion,fhcdqpd,t3_f28t6s,1581461217.0,"Especially when it's coming from a third party, who assumes based on my outgoing personality that I don't have any mental health issues. Case in point  ""You really shouldn't have been so hard on so and so, they have ~anxiety~""
Me too, bitch, you ain't special."
Anxiety,fhcd9q3,t3_f2fjwm,1581460993.0,"I very recently went through the same, and honestly after the first ""soo about my mental health..."" it was very easy. Your doctor has most likely spoken to way more people about their anxiety than you have about yours, so they're not going to be uncomfortable or weird about it. Good luck!"
Anxiety,fguck5h,t3_f0iq5p,1581117523.0,"I have been taking it a few weeks as well, and I have noticed the results really vary based on a few things. Mostly my daily routine, like did I get a full nights sleep and am I eating regularly. When I'm on a good routine I feel great, but when I'm not taking good care of myself then it makes me feel more down. I also have to make sure I'm keeping up with hydration, since I've noticed that will impact too."
Anxiety,fgfwwa1,t3_ex801k,1580749380.0,"It works wonders for my physical symptoms, which gives me the capacity to use the skills from therapy to keep myself in a good state of mind. I've been taking it for a few weeks now, and the only negative I have is drowsiness, which isnt even as bad as when I take other
 antihistamines. Whatever happens when you take something like benadryl is a good gauge for how you will respond.

Hope it's helped!"

ETA: the epidurals did wonders for me, but I managed to re-slip one of them and probably need a round 2 sometime soon. The timing on this post is funny."

Anxiety,fgda6mx,t3_exthqr,1580680378.0,My dentist was the first person to diagnose me with anxiety .... because my jaw muscles were so tight I must have been having panic attacks
Anxiety,fgd83c5,t1_fgd7kcy,1580679835.0,Exactly. I am one of those perky and upbeat people BECAUSE of my anxiety.
MealPrepSunday,fe3ytpb,t3_enqaxg,1578854100.0,"This is my go to for weekly meal prep as well! The one thing I did to make it easier was roasting the broccoli with the potatoes and my normal go to seasonings, turns out it holds the flavor really well and  I dont think I've steamed my broccoli since."
