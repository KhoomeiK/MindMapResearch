Anxiety,fmuwq31,t3_fxc59w,1586400590.0,I don't know if the percentages are right or if there's even a way to measure the percentage of people who like or dislike you in your life... But I agree with the concept and wish I applied it more to my life. Im always myself with strangers but once I like someone my anxiety takes over :/

polyamory,eoyx9el,t3_btj2f9,1558948264.0,I can't really give you advice but I'm in a similar situation and trying to figure out myself how to go about moving forward. I've been together with my boyfriend for about 3 years now as well. He has always been supportive of me finding a girlfriend because I'm bi but then I ended up finding a guy I was attracted to and that ended up messing with our relationship. Mainly because I thought I had to break up with current boyfriend instead of talking to him in order to keep from hurting him but ended up hurting both myself and him instead. We are back together to an extent and he's more understanding than I am. I'm still struggling with myself because we hear and see often that being with multiple people is wrong. I hope you figure out how to move forward with what works best for you.
