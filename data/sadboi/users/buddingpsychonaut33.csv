Put your phone, computer, etc in the basement or somewhere literally out of your physical reach

But don’t try to make yourself study super intensely right away, just do fun things that are a bit easier to stay engaged with than school work. 

The point is to slow down your mind and bring it into the present by doing stuff that’s physical and right in front of you."

Literally going through this right now.

Self sabotage is the devil that victims of abuse must overcome to finally break the cycle.

It’s hard, but see this as an opportunity for the growth you really yearn for.

Now is the time that you are facing yourself finally - with nobody else around to distract you from working on you. 

Know you’re not alone in this journey - I am also with you. I keep slipping into self destruction after finally ending an extremely draining relationship with a psychopathic narc. 

We must fight for a new beginning, with new patterns. 

Trust that you know the way. Listen to the little voice inside underneath the clutter of fears and toxic habits. 

Somewhere in you knows the way. Trust that you know how to care for yourself. 

I’m doing it slowly but surely too.

Good luck. <3"

Psychonaut,f3h2d1x,t3_dgxsbs,1570918029.0,"I agree with the bad anime drawing guy.

Sometimes when the story gets this big, we get lost in it instead of finding a grounded course of action to achieve those desires of wanting to love yourself and others genuinely.

The “dark one” you mentioned is a professional at making things muddy, unclear, and confusing so you stay seduced by the fog. 

Find a way to snap yourself out of that fog and take practical steps to improve your life. 

There is a big story going on, but if thinking about it isn’t helping you thrive and is making you stuck, I highly recommend redirecting your thought energy to other things.  

The practice of spiritual “remembering” you speak of lays in practical behaviors that promote spiritual health. 

You are in control. Find the reigns and start consciously directing your own mind. (Easier said than done of course, but better to start trying now rather than later!)"
AskWomen,f3d17sy,t3_dghr1g,1570830623.0,"1. Stay busy - don’t isolate! Get an engaging job that keeps you on your feet. Learn a new skill.
2. Turn lonely alone time into “fuck yea, I can do whatever I want” time. Solo dance parties. Trying out new sex toys. Watching movies you wouldn’t want to watch with other people. Etc.
3. Have fun taking yourself out - start taking dance classes, go to museums, do fun shit out by yourself and enjoy being with you.
4. Make yourself useful in society. Soup kitchen once a week. Volunteer for something you’re interested in. Do a nice thing for a stranger. 

Discover that life can be full and interesting and it will help you heal patterns of emotional trauma."
LifeAfterNarcissism,f3czpg7,t3_dgjeu1,1570830112.0,"Good for u my dude

if you can transform just some of that loneliness into enjoying you time, you will change your life forever.

Think of it this way: only you know how you like to be treated down to the most precise details. Only you know your favorite everything (food, movie, color, decor style, favorite thing about yourself to be complimented on etc) 

Nobody else in the world knows how to treat you exactly how you like to be treated so take advantage of the fact that you get to do that for yourself!

Practice giving yourself all the small pleasures that you genuinely love. Take as many moments as possible to enjoy your specific personality traits and what you’re doing.

Learning how to be alone in a genuinely loving, curious, and enjoyable way is the first step to everything you want."
spirituality,f3cp1zo,t3_dghefz,1570826572.0,"I’ve had the same experience.

What I’ve come to know is that no spiritual guide phenomena is external. It’s all about your perception of reality - not some outside thing penetrating your current perception of life.

The thing that opened me up more to my guides was getting to know my inner self more. Opening me up to myself allowed guides and other spiritual experiences to take place.

It’s all about knowing yourself. You can do things other than meditation to get to know yourself.

For example, instead of feeling as if Tarot or I-Ching are being guided by mysterious outside forces that are bigger and more powerful than you, envision that all the answers you get are what the Inner You wants you to know in that moment.

Good luck."

ADHD,eywn0gr,t3_cz3eoo,1567533234.0,"You are NOT the only one!!

I thought I was till I found this post!

That is ~exactly~ to a tee what happened with my last job in an office. Including the inability to work and focus and the social anxiety. 
I was so hard on myself because I had no idea why it was happening and everything I tried to fix it didn’t work.

Depending on what type of learner and worker you are, you may need a job that’s more holistically engaging (meaning you use your body more so you don’t get stuck in your head and mentally overdrawn.) 

After my last office job I worked on a farm for 1 year and found my whole relationship to work was radically different. Whenever my mind got tired of the paperwork logistics aspects, there was plenty of physical activity built into the work to de-stress myself and stay engaged while still being productive. 

This is just speaking from experience. Not all of us are built for jobs where you’re sitting all day and virtually ignoring the body. 

Don’t be hard on yourself for this struggle! Simply get to know your needs and if you have the option, choose a work environment that supports those."
