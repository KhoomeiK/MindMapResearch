The reason why is that with effective and astute evaluation skills you can almost always find ample etiology to understand their mental health issues/struggles. And if you work in the field long enough you see that most “illness” is actually normal responses to trauma, stress, life. 

A common rebuttal is that a clinician will say I didn’t see anything, they didn’t report anything, and so forth, and that is where it takes good evaluation and people skills. A cursory scan of a patients life, you will only see symptoms, which then might confirm that it came from ‘nowhere.’"
