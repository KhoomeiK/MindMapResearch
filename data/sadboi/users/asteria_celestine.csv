When I ran it the first time, I didn‚Äôt trust when the lasers were going to go off so I couldn‚Äôt top off everyone as we were so spread out. I felt that if I had moved an inch from my spot, the lasers would go off and I‚Äôd get hit. I focused heavily on those lasers (especially the ones on the opposite end) and where I was positioned that by the time the orange pointers exploded, I hadn‚Äôt topped myself off. I was also fresh out of the MSQ and most likely undergeared like no tomorrow. (I forgot to equip the 430 gear from Grenoldt prior to entering the dungeons.)

I ran it again and cleared it with the second group after reconfiguring my gear. I did feel that the mechanics didn‚Äôt have to be explained, until I died the 2nd time, then I wondered if there was something I was missing.

What could be easy for you could be confusing for others, keep that in mind. I feel that the Twinning was harder than Akadaemia or Amaurot."

I died in each boss though because of some mechanics I didn‚Äôt understand. Finally had enough on the third boss because I died 2x and we wiped each time, so I asked the group if there was something I was missing. Literally got vote dismissed right then and there.

It was infuriating to say the least. While I understand that dying multiple times isn‚Äôt really the best way to present yourself as a healer/player, a little explanation of the mechanics might‚Äôve helped if they cleared it before. I would‚Äôve understood the vote dismissal if I still didn‚Äôt get it right after the mechanics being explained.

Finally got the clear on my next run with my SO explaining the mechanics, but damn. I‚Äôm reminded that some people can be assholes in this game."
TalesFromTheCustomer,escmxh2,t1_esc3xg4,1561833536.0,"Let me lay this out for you: The lady manager was the first to help me, and I put my phone down while she was helping me pay. She was already in mid conversation with Am_r when I got to the processing screen, so I took this as a chance to continue reading on my phone. When Am_r hopped on, I was in the middle of that processing screen and expected to be out of there in less than a minute if the transaction went through.

As a customer service employee, what would you have to gain from calling out a customer for being on their phone when the transaction is about to finish? As I responded to earlier comments, he said it in such a condescending tone that even anyone would have said, ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù If it was done as a kind suggestion, I would‚Äôve turned it into a kind conversation. I don‚Äôt enjoy angry confrontations, but, like I said, I have no problem letting someone know how disrespectful they were being."

TalesFromTheCustomer,escm071,t1_esc2qmh,1561832846.0,"My phone has a pocket on the back for all of my cards so I would‚Äôve had it out anyway, and, to be honest, I was on my 30min lunch break from work and didn‚Äôt want to be bothered by conversation. I was expecting to be in and out of that store to pay for my items, not to be berated and provoked by an employee. When he hopped on the register, I was already in the processing screen and he made no attempt to make conversation with me so I would‚Äôve only had a minute left if the payment did go through. I put my phone down for the lady manager who helped me through my transaction.

No, I don‚Äôt think I overreacted. If anyone heard the tone in his voice, anyone would have said, ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù If it was said any other way, like maybe as a kind suggestion, I would‚Äôve smiled and told them what I was reading and why I was reading it. The reason why I reacted the way I did was because of the way he said it.

GameStop,es19c7y,t3_c5d1f8,1561491893.0,"I quit GameStop 2 years ago when the whole Kotaku article came out, not because of their (stressful) expectations that time, but because of my SL‚Äôs inability to handle and recognize favoritism and insubordination. I was an ASL in a busy mall store and having an incompetent SGA and an SGA-in-training during the holidays (while my SL was in the hospital for 3 weeks) was enough to drive me out.

I job-hopped for a while and found that I felt more secure with GameStop. Out of the 5 jobs I had after quitting, GameStop had policies in place to protect workers, an HR that ACTUALLY works/exists, and it‚Äôs a place where I can talk about my passion with like-minded people! 

So I came back two months ago at a different district with a new team and really, what a difference it makes when your team and boss are on the same page and are absolutely awesome individuals. I had already enjoyed the job before I quit (yes, even the sometimes impossible demands) but having an excellent team is definitely the icing on the cake!"

I was doing research on this once, and you can actually request ‚ÄúReasonable Accommodation‚Äù if you have a disability. Maybe speak with your manager/HR and ask how this process goes? I haven‚Äôt gone this route, although I have requested a ‚Äúdoctor‚Äôs note‚Äù from my therapists before that I gave to my boss every time I took a mental health day. This meant actually seeing my therapist though and making an emergency appointment.


No need to read further, just wanted to share:

I also had a psychologist tell me before when I asked if I could be put on medication that I was still functioning, so I didn‚Äôt need medication. Her idea was that since depression and anxiety runs in the family, I‚Äôd have to deal with it often down the line, so better find other ways of coping than rely on meds.

However, when I think back on it, I was having severe panic attacks every 10mins, and every minute of my life was spent trying to survive not just the world around me, but the world inside me. I was only 16 and dropped out of high school because of my panic attacks and a terrible financial situation. I think medication would‚Äôve helped.

Either way, I‚Äôm lucky to have had jobs that recognize anxiety and depression, and a current boss that recognizes mental health issues because he himself goes through it. I‚Äôve been toying with the idea of calling out, but after seeing how I‚Äôve been the past couple of days, my boss decided to give me 3 days off 2 weeks from now. You have no idea how excited I am and how it makes me want to work more despite the fatigue.

There are people and jobs like that out there, OP. You will find them. Keep fighting the fight."

A ‚Äútech specialist‚Äù (which I assume to be their supervisor) called me a day later and apologized for what happened and lowered my phone bill by $200-$300 for the trouble! Needless to say, I was satisfied. The collection company stopped calling after that. :)

depression,eq7thzy,t3_bxiz28,1559852961.0,"Literally just cried to my boyfriend about this. I‚Äôve had a few months clean of depression and anxiety, a space to breathe. And all of a sudden, last week, I started to have panic attacks and then my depression came back.

Depression and anxiety are both liars. Nothing has changed in my external environment, save for a bunch of positive changes. Literally nothing to be sad about, a bit stressed from work maybe, but nothing I can‚Äôt handle. Supposedly.

However, my depression and anxiety flares up over such small tiny things. My therapist said that it seems I carry the voice of my overbearing aunt within me, the same aunt who emotionally and physically abused me as a child, making me feel like I was always doing something wrong.

Every single day since last week, my body has been screaming, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fuck up. You don‚Äôt deserve to relax. You don‚Äôt deserve to feel happiness.‚Äù All the while I fight back with doing things I enjoy, reminding myself not to listen, that everything is okay, and my body is just lying to me.

But it gets so hard. I woke up this morning feeling okay. Then a few minutes later, I‚Äôm down in tears because the whole entire week of being strong seemed like it didn‚Äôt work. I kind of gave in to my depression a bit. So I cried to someone I trust and expressed what I felt and been feeling. I find that being listened to and being able to express what I feel definitely helps. I‚Äôm very lucky to have someone like this by my side.

Then I come onto Reddit and I see this, like its the universe‚Äôs response to my being strong, coming from another human being who knows what its like.

Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You reminded me to keep fighting, keep being strong. Everything is okay. I just have to convince myself by taking care of me and doing the things I love.

Kudos to you, kind stranger. Thank you. üôè"

Advice,epx3mcl,t3_bwewzk,1559591236.0,"I don‚Äôt know much of the family or their situation, but I think if you tell him, it might open up a can of worms and potentially destroy the family depending on their family dynamic. 

I definitely think you should proceed with caution, depending on how well you know the family and people involved. Think about it a little more by looking at the possible outcomes. Make a list of positive and negative reactions and from there, try to see if saying something is worth it. If it is an option, you can also reach out to your ex and communicate why it concerns you, and maybe he/she can help. 

But like I said, this all depends on who they are and their current situation. Best of luck!"

PanicAttack,eorv0yi,t3_bso7k7,1558813319.0,"I was 14 when I had my first panic attack, and the first 10months were the absolute worst. I did all kinds of research online and barely saw a therapist/psychologist because no one in my family knew what was going on with me. Growing up in a third world country does that.

The first thing that truly helped was surrendering myself to the panic attacks completely. I let my body panic away and my mind think the thoughts and never put any weight on them as they go. I did this during my last month, and the feeling of doom subsided.

I‚Äôm 23 now and I still get panic attacks from time to time, but it‚Äôs become easier to recognize that it‚Äôs just my body doing its thing, and there‚Äôs actually nothing wrong with me or my life. I‚Äôve mastered letting the symptoms come and go while going about my day.

My advice to you is this: When you‚Äôre not feeling any of the symptoms of a panic attack, notice how right everything feels. When you do get a panic attack, let it wash over you but keep hold of that feeling of security, and practice going about your day despite the panic. If you need to stop what you‚Äôre doing because you can‚Äôt concentrate, I would recommend meditating on whatever you‚Äôre feeling, breathe, and give yourself a pat on the back. If you need to put life on hold because of your panic attacks, please do so. Give yourself time off work or school. This is considered a serious medical situation and should be treated as such.

You‚Äôll be fine! There are plenty of methods to cope with a panic attack. I would also recommend seeing a therapist/psychologist as they can help you find various coping mechanisms that can help you through the process. Good luck and I hope this helps!"
