movies,fekt6m7,t3_e6l8bc,1579207087.0,"What was Mary Ann's deal? Like, what was she trying to do? The two of the three times she had dialogue all left me a little confused.

1.) In the beginning at the party, we hear Mary Ann say ""I'm going over now"" and someone say ""Mary Ann, don't"" and she goes over and whispers to Charlie. I assumed maybe she was saying something flirty but I looked up the script and she is just talking about benign stage notes. Why was she so insistent on going over? Why did someone try to stop her? What message was she trying to send? She also looked over at Nicole before she did it. But why make such a production out of stage notes?

2.) When Charlie is at the bar with the company towards the end of the movie (right before the ""Being Alive"" song, he's talking about his divorce and apologizes for being boring and self-pitying. Everyone consoles him and says its okay, but Mary Ann pipes up louder than the rest saying ""No, no, it is sad"". There is a beat of silence. What does that mean? What was she doing/communicating?
