EatingDisorders,et1y83w,t1_esrpesf,1562406636.0,"I think this is really important message. It may sound counter intuitive and as though you are fasilitating the ed. but this is what my dad did for me. It meant that i was at leaste eating. For him it enabled him to understand the peramiters of what i was living under without me having to activly speak about it. By removing the shame it takes assosiatded with having to decive people, i slowly found it easier to talk about the eating disorder. Its true it is not sustainable way to live. But for now its a practical way of holding the situation untill you can see a specalist therepy. I didnt start recovery propely untill i saw a specialit eating disorder therepist. But the connection that was build from not deciving my dad, was massivly beneficial when it came to activly adress my issues during recovery. I would say that EDs are paralising and have a tendency to make the sufferes, loved ones feel helpfless and disempowered much as the suffer does. The fact that your reaching out for infomation is brilliant, its important for you to have support through out,as said above its increidbly hard to deal with alone.
I hope you are able to find what you need for both you and your daughter."
