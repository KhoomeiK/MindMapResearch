BPD,fatf1md,t3_eaea34,1576337555.0,"this happens to me a lot. i realized that tackling the emotion that comes with it is just as important as tackling the obsessive thoughts, so i use skills my therapists have taught me:

1. recognize i'm feeling strong emotions and literally force myself to stop for a second (because it's so hard to make yourself stop when you're starting to have a borderline thought/feeling spiral, the skill of recognizing and freezing is an important skill in order to use other skills)
2. for the emotion aspect, even if i don't want to, focus on where i can feel the emotion in my body and breathe into it with deep long breaths. do this for 30 seconds to a minute, or however long it takes
3. remember (for instance, in your case with this post) the times that i have done this same thing to someone else and it meant nothing. i view this evidence completely separate from my emotional self by choosing to view it in a way without passing any sort of mental judgement on it, often while doing the above emotional soothing
4. do all this until the feeling passes. all feelings pass, and remembering this is a huge step towards healing from BPD.

above all, remember you're doing the best you can and remind yourself that your feelings are valid just like anybody else's feelings (even if they are obsessive/self destructive/negative! the feelings may feel bad but they are still your feelings. you can validate them and still not act on them, it's tough but it's a step forward)

i hope this helps! everyone's journey with BPD is different, i'm doing DBT exercises/therapy currently and want to share what i'm learning with everyone."
