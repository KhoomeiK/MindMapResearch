It's just temporary. Just waiting for the moment you hit a bump in the road or actually have to do stuff to get to that future you (sometimes) dream of. 

At least, that's how it feels for me. I wish things could get normal for once. I wish I could become normal. But I have zero brainpower left to plan ahead, to dream of a future and work towards it...

First girlfriend and I did this quite often on the couch. She always got tired around 3 or 4 pm. We cuddled up on the couch, me being the bigger spoon, and we fell asleep. Those were great 1 or 2 hour naps. Nice and warm. 

Second girlfriend wasn't really into this during the day and somehow in bed this cuddling thing wasn't for me. I couldn't sleep, her hair would irritate the hell out of me etc. But there was one time, we stayed the night somewhere where it was so freaking cold. We spooned and \*poof\* we woke up... it was morning already. Best night sleep I ever had I think.

But in the end, depression got the better of me. In both cases. I lost them both. And these are great memories, but knowing you had it and you lost it (and it's your fault)... I don't know... I think I would rather stay in the dreamy state you are in now."

Your story resonates with me. I once knew a girl when I was younger. Our moms were good friends. We lived far away but we occasionally went to visit and vice versa. The girl was quirky, but beautiful in her own way. I really liked her. At least that how I remember it. I think it was more like she liked me and I was like eeeew, girls... Only later to realize what's what.

When we got in our teens we lost contact, because our parents starting making plans without us. Teenagers not wanting to do anything their parents suggest, I guess (probably my fault). Even though I didn't see her anymore from that point on, I often thought of her. She's the crush you never forget. 

Anyway, I'm in my early twenties, my dad died, I got depressed and my life was falling apart (not the point her). Months pass and then I got a message from my mother. 

That girl, that quirky and beautiful girl, she apparently had been depressed since her teens. She lived alone with her mother. And in a moment of being home alone she took her own life. She also hung herself. In the shed behind her house. Her mother found her there. 

I didn't get to go to the funeral, don't even remember why anymore. I think my mom didn't want me to go because she was afraid what it would do to me I think. I don't really remember anymore (depression fog).

But I remember the pain I felt. I went to visit her grave. Didn't cry there, but I lost it when I got home. I still dos sometimes. I miss that girl. I always start thinking, what if we stayed in touch? Maybe I could have helped her. And I really start blaming myself...

But hell, her mother, that's the person I really felt for. Finding your daughter like that... Just like you did with your friend... I have no words for that. And yeah, she went into a massive depression.

But it's been ten years now. I still think of her, but this is and was never meant to be told as my story. The point is, her mom, she's again living her life and even enjoying things again. Or so I'm told by my mom. It took therapy and medication, even seekimg it abroad, but she got back on her feet sort of speak. I'm afraid to be there when she visits my mom next week, afraid that me and my depression will just fuck things up. 

But hell, I'm drifting. Point is. Hold on. No promises. I myself don't see a way out of this shit, but the fact that that woman, that mother, did... Just wow.

There's hope. But first there's pain. A lot of pain."

depression,f172gs2,t1_f15j0mm,1569233383.0,"The outdoors are great. It will definitely be worth it to go. 

In the beginning of this year I went away with my now ex girlfriend to the woods. First time in years I really went anywhere for more then 2 days. I was nervous as hell as I also wasn't in the best state of mind. Weird to be nervous for something so simple. At first I wasn't sure if I would like it and although I had my bad moments (depression saying hi) I really loved the outdoors. The hiking, the no people and the weather was really nice. In the end I really enjoyed it. So my advice: go do it. 

I did wonder of with my thoughts from time to time. Thinking about my life ""out there in the real world"". But worrying about that is part of the accepting. Your life is what it is. You can make it better, but it won't happen over night. Just make small steps. One thing per day. At the end of the year you will have done 365 things. 

To give you an idea; I've been wanting to start working out again for ages now, but I'm somehow afraid of the gym. The people. Being watched etc. I know how strange and weird that must sound, but it really stops me from going and I procrastinate the shit out of it. But two weeks ago I bought the gym membership. A week later I searched and found an app that could really help with the routine. This week I'm going to watch video's of the exercises so I can get some virtual experience. I'm slowly building back up my confidence. Hopefully next week or the week after that I'll have the strength to go to the gym in real life. 

We can wait for life to happen, but I think we both know that that will never happen until we go do something.

And just relax if it doesn't work out the first time around or doesn't happen as fast as you want it to."

Try to distract yourself with music (positive music!) and sit it out. I don't really have another solution then that. I remember the times where I felt like this for several weeks. Shits awful.

Get some sort of zenlike feeling, even if it is a kind of bit depressed kind of zen. Take care of yourself. Sleep, shower, get dressed, eat and repeat. And every day you do something. One thing.

depression,f0tmwqz,t3_d6gaah,1568925131.0,"""I’m not lazy, you’re just a neurotypical who doesn’t understand how draining this all is. I am so full of rage and hatred that it’s all I am. It consumes me, swallows me whole.""

This is what matters. This is the core of your message I think. I've been where you are and still am in a way. I can totally relate, although I never really tried to end it. So I'm not saying this will totally help you. It's not meant to help, just to share my story.q

From my own experience I can tell you this.

The anger, towards life in general and to other people, is something that's killing you slowly and making your depression even harder to deal with. I don't know if it went away because enough time had passed or that working out (try boxing) helped in anyway. I took a boxing class twice and it helped me vent my energy during that period. My guess is it distracts your brain and focusses the anger towards something real to hit. It took all the energy out of me for a couple of days. 

But when the anger subsides you really need to focus on not giving a shit. Letting go. That's the only thing that will prevent you from getting worse in the future again. Or at least it has made me feeling numb to everything, which maybe isn't that great, but it's better than feeling so fucking depressed that you cry yourself to sleep every day. 

And the ""laziness"" is something I haven't really got an answer to. I still have a lack of energy and don't get the things done during the day that I planned. Sometimes I don't get done anythjng. I don't really know what it is. I just bought a gym membership again trying to get myself in some shape again, but during the past week I couldn't move myself out of bed in the morning towards the gym.... 

So yeah, not a great answer. Not a real solution. Just know I get how you're feeling and you're not alone. Just try to allow yourself to take the time it takes for the anger to subside. Don't take my story as something you need to do as well. And don't take other people seriously. Most are ignorant and or just try their best to give their 2 cents."
depression,f0tf4tt,t3_d6dxpl,1568921013.0,"Hello me. 

Yes, it's impossible. I am thinking that as well. I'm in my thirties and I have had two relationships. Both ended because I didn't have the energy or motivation to get myself moving towards the future. 

I honestly think it's a rational game with women on this front. Especially in their 20s and 30s. They are more and more thinking about the future. The love they feel in the beginning and perhaps also in the end is no match to the underlying thought that he (me) can't provide the future they are looking for. They need a provider, someone that will and can take care of their future family. It's freaking instinct I guess.

It sounds weird but I've seen the exact same pattern in both relationships. And yes, N=2, so maybe this is all just my biased self drawing conclusions, but hear me out. It's the twelve step program of a depressed person getting in a relationship.

1. You are dealing with depression (me)
2. Girl initiates contact (I know, sounds like hitting the lottery. Unreal, I know. But happened twice.) and you hit it off.
3. You hold of, thinking you're not right for her or at least she deserves much better.
4. She holds on, perhaps it's the challenge of changing and or helping someone.
5. You finally give in. It's official now.
6. Period of happiness. You can't believe you're in a relationship. All is happy and fun and new and great.
7. Period of her hitting a rough patch. In my case both of them got depressed after 3 to 6 months in. It's contagious or they just let themselves go (and to test you uncontiously?).
8. Period of you taking care of her. You set aside your problems. Maybe it's me, my personality, but I don't abandon someone when things get rough. Some friends of my first girlfriend (who really had extreme episodes and wanted to hurt herself) commended me for sticking with her. They didn't know if they would have done the same if they were in my shoes. Any way, let's continue.
9. Period of her getting better. You managed to help her see the light in a way. She's doing much better. She's starting to explore her life again. And she's always saying your the sweetest man she's ever known. The I love you more or I love you till infinity plus one phase.
10. With nothing to focus on anymore, you start to think about your own feelings, problems  and future again. Depression is waiting around the corner to give you a nice big hug. Hello old friend.
11. The depression continues and you don't know what to do other than sit it out and hope it gets better. It most of the time goes to an acceptable level so you can cope on a daily basis. You still try your best, work out, see a therapist etcetera. But it takes time for it to just go down to acceptable levels. She tries to help, but doesn't really know how.
12. She finally has had enough. This takes about 6 months or a bit less. She wants to take a break or says she's not in love with you anymore. The last one honestly said that she could see that I was trying and doing my best, but she didn't see me ever getting out of the negative a.k.a. my depression. 

So yeah, long story long. But that's all folks. Back to 1.

Maybe I got unlucky. Maybe it's a coincidence. Maybe I'm biased. But I honestly did everything for them. Took care of them when they were down (for years even) and helped out anyway I could. And in both cases I eventually even helped them get 'better'.

And what do they do? Leave."

That's depression or maybe in your case a quarter/midlife crisis? You seem to be doing great in life, but you seem to be stuck with the question ""what's next?"". To be blunt, life is pointless. It's only what you make of it yourself. It's all relative and nothing you do will matter in 100 or 1000 years. So in the event of not being able to focus on your own goals, in your case, try to focus on your family in the here and now. Talk to your wife and let her in. You won't feel like keeping things from her and getting things of your chest helps. And go spoil your wife and daughter. Go do stuff together. Take your mind of things. Your family, that's all that really matters, right?  

And if you want to explore these feelings further; people will probably say to go talk to a therapist. That's always an option. But before that I would suggest to talk with your wife. And perhaps you can start by figuring out for yourself when this all started? When did you start to feel this feeling for the first time?

I think therapy can work if you get the right therapist and you have a problem that has it's root in a 'single and simple to diagnose' event sort of speak which can be handled by some sort of standardized therapy. And  it helps when you're a tiny bit gullible (no offence).

That being said, I have talked to 5 therapist in my life and none of them really helped. Sometimes it was good to get things of my chest and on some occasions I really did get extra insight on my issues.

To be fair, only the last two were focussing on the issues I am dealing with now. The first three were not that serious, more grief counselling at the time. 

The last two therapist: Daignosing wasn't the issue, but finding the cause and an answer for that diagnose was. If things get to complicated, forget about it. You're not going to get anywhere with a session a week. They both tried standardized therapies to treat ptsd, depression, anxiety etcetera. All the things I show signs of now and then. A freaking basket case of small problems resulting in me. 

I wanted it all to work but every time I hit a brick wall. The first one didn't really put in the effort. She finally wanted me to start group counselling. I agreed but got turned down by the therapists that were leading the actual group. They sent me back, because they didn't believe this was right for me. Totally fucked up organization, because I got send back and forth two times and after that they stopped contacting me. I lost all faith in them, issued a complaint and left. Lost almost 2 years with this shit. No help at all.

And the last one did give insights from time to time, but with one session a week it was slowly killing me. There was no progress. Tried multiple therapies. I complained about the lack of guidance from his part and got into a verbal fight... I pissed him off... And after all that he literally said (this was after also almost 2 years in which I tried to come up with my own therapy the last half year) he didn't know how to help me. So yeah, bye I guess.

After all that, three weeks ago, after crawling back up the past year on my own, I went back to my general practitioner to ask for help and get a different perspective on my options. She would get back to me in a couple of days. It's been three weeks now since the appointment and I haven't heard back from her.

So yeah, fuck therapist and doctors. I'm tired of running after them to give me a first or second look. You can ask for help. But getting help is another thing. And help actually helping, man, that's fucking Utopia.

I'm trying to accept that the numb and apathetic feeling, the lack of joy and motivation, that it's here to stay. And from what I've read I'm not alone. Once you get to a certain point of numbness, nothing works.

I used to use drugs and alcohol to pass the time, mostly in the evening. You're alone, don't want to feel sad, and this way you relax, don't think and sleep like a baby. But in the end it doesn't make things better. It's a bandaid that keeps the wound from healing.

There is, just hold on. And try to stop wanting her back. It's the past. It was a nice chapter in your life, but it's time for the next one. I know that sounds lame, but it's true. 

And to be honest, you shouldn't let your happiness be dependent on any relationship. You need to love yourself before you can say I love you to someone else. You don't need someone to be happy and if you do you will only set yourself up for failure.

And on top of that from what I've heard and read about other people's experience I don't know if it's a good idea at all. But I honestly don't know what else I could try."

Teach me please.

I can take care of myself, but that's about it. I'm tired, don't feel joy and have zero motivation to do stuff."

And what you describe sounds like a more difficult combination/situation than me. Have you tried therapy and or medication to alleviate the things that hold you back?"

Maybe you're right, but should that stop you from helping yourself? Pardon my language but fuck what other people think of you. All I can tell you; Just give it time. Don't force yourself. Maybe start with something simple like a diary of some sorts. It will give you something to do and you can read it back later. Maybe you can learn something from that. And perhaps read other people's stories. That has helped me a lot. Often thought I was alone, but now I find comfort in knowing there are a lot of people struggling with the same set of feelings and problems. Maybe someone will write down the exact same things you want to share but can't for now."

>Is it necessary to talk to people about how you really feel sometimes because I've been keeping alot inside me for a long time?

What is your answer to this?

We've come full circle, no? You seem to want to vent your feelings and your pain, but you're afraid to do it. But it's necessary for you to move on. You're stuck right now in self hate an despair. You're stuck in your own way of thinking and believing there is no answer out there. And a possible solution or step towards one makes you so afraid that you back out of it. I know it's hard, I wish I could give you that little push towards some peace of mind, but you need to open up for negative shit to go out and perhaps let positive things let in. Or maybe not the latter one. Just venting in itself will make you feel a whole lot better. I've been here for a couple of weeks now and I find it relaxing to just get stuff of my chest. I myself have nobody to talk to either. Took me a long time to try this, still finding it really hard, but the fact that I'm anonymous makes it a whole lot better."
depression,eyqfsce,t1_eyqepjs,1567341420.0,"You don't have to do it all at once. Writing this post is your very first step.

And you want to do this. The fact that you're reaching out is proof of that. You are probably right about a lot of things, but probably also wrong on a few others. You'll only find out what those things are is if you open up to people or try and find the answer somewhere else (books, video's, therapists etc.). It's not necessary that people tell you you're wrong. It's necessary that you get to know yourself better. So you will have a better outlook on things and maybe change some things if you're able and get rid of the feeling you have now.

I know, it's way easier to think of this and say it to someone else than to act on it yourself. But in the end the only person you can trust and rely on is you. So why not start by writing it down. 

What would you like to tell someone?   
What is it you need to get off your chest? 

Write down your story and share it. You're completely anonymous. So you've got nothing to lose, right?"
