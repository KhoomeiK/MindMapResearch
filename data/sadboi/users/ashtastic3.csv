It cured my teenage acne, which has decided to flare up as an adult, and lightened my periods some, but did absolutely nothing else to help my hormones. It always made my symptoms worse. I gained TONS of spider veins all over my body, rapid weight gain, moon swings, and horrific daily acid reflux that was never subsided with antacids or prescriptions.

PMDD,fr0fik9,t3_gl4zlm,1589793787.0,"I find it both fascinating and sad that ‚Äúthe hysterical‚Äù females, alleged Witchcraft, and demon possession have been interrelated throughout our history. Menstrual cycles are deeply rooted in society, and the cultural implications can be traced back throughout literature, such as this piece by Hippocrates. 

It is thought by many that PMS and PMDD are cultural bound syndromes because cultures identify symptoms differently. Some identify with symptoms more than others, like the United States, with some not associating, specifically with PMDD, *at all*. Depending on the region and time, these symptoms can be related to something else entirely, like general depression, spirit possession, hysteria, etc. 

A lot of discourse regarding PMS/PMDD now, especially in Western medicine and Psychology, are on the biological grounds vs gender role implications (hint to Hippocrates‚Äô piece and it‚Äôs implications over time). Some professionals refuse to acknowledge any legitimacy within these diagnoses because of how stigmatizing it is to be labeled as a mental illness in the DSM. 

I have a lot of questions regarding the history of menstrual cycles and what it means to women everywhere around the world today, and I feel I‚Äôm not alone when asking them. It is interesting to ponder those that never experience this, but why do I, in such a real and life altering way? What language do I have that others do not? What has been passed down culturally over generations that have influenced the way I associate myself with my symptoms? At what point in Western medicine does feminism give more of a disadvantage to women suffering from this and their treatment because it is believed too stigmatizing to even recognize? Why do we in the US identify with PMS more so than anywhere else? Does it have to do with our food? 

I could go on...*sigh*"

I am experiencing a huge change in my skin as I get into my older 20‚Äôs. It‚Äôs extremely dry and textured with bumps that don‚Äôt produce any heads. I get hormonal pimples but do not struggle with acne. I do struggle with chronic styes due to my hormone issue (PMDD) and baby soap every night works WONDERS if anyone else struggles with that. I am trying to switch to vegan/cruelty free products only, and begin working a routine that reduces aging signs. Here is my routine so far:

AM: I wash with water and moisturize with Vanicream. 
PM: I wash with baby soap, tone with witch hazel, and moisturize with Vanicream. 

3-4x week I use either Badger‚Äôs unscented face oil or maricuja oil, and once a week I use Dermalogica microexfoliant. This has worked for me until the past 6 or so months. I was also using a Badgers face sunscreen but it‚Äôs incredibly white casted. 

My questions:

So, I‚Äôve noticed most vitamin c serums include hyaluronic acid. I want to incorporate both into my routine, so I feel killing two birds with one stone is worth it here. I found one by Amara beauty on Amazon. Has anyone tried this or know of a similar CF product?

Best CF sunscreen with no streaks or white cast? 

Best CF eye cream for dark circles? 

I can not afford good quality retinols right now with the pandemic and my health insurance. What do you suggest as a good pore/black head reducer or eliminator?

TalkTherapy,fjag8yw,t3_fcarr1,1583172872.0,"I‚Äôm truly thankful I have my talk therapist and EMDR specialist on the same team working with the same facility. While my talk therapist doesn‚Äôt regularly practice EMDR, she is trained in it. I‚Äôve done one EMDR session for a specific instance of childhood sexual abuse with the EMDR specialist and then one EMDR session that was unplanned and guided during regular talk therapy due to another sad, yet less traumatic event. 

With the specialist, she used the node machine that buzzes in your hands and reorganizes the memory process. We started with a negative affirmation and ended with a positive affirmation. She had beads, sand, and other sensory items available but I did not use them. I noticed physical changes within my body, such as tension in my middle back leaving almost immediately after the session. Mentally, I was less emotionally attached to the memory of it. I also felt no need to ever wear a bra again, unless it was for work. As I was out in public, I didn‚Äôt feel like people were staring at me or judging my body. I felt more grounded in my body. It was quite liberating. Before the session, I was taking a shower and was thrown into a full blown flashback of the event, which was the first time I was even aware of said event. I had compartmentalized it as it happened when I was a child, and throughout my talk therapy sessions of other sexual abuse I was aware of, it began to surface. Given how sudden and traumatic the memory was, I made the appointment quickly because that was what worked for me, but that is not for everyone!!!!

The other time when I was in talk therapy with my regular therapist and it turned into an EMDR session, it was not as much of a traumatic experience to me so I feel the effects were less intense. It entailed an event in which I felt abandoned but sexual abuse was not involved. Nonetheless it helped tremendously. 

It is extremely hard to avoid a situation when external factors throw it in your face anyways, such as holidays where fireworks are a given. The point of EMDR is to shift the awareness to a stance that is not debilitating to your life. However, EMDR is different for everyone, and the most important advice I can give you is to not do it until you‚Äôre ready."

I guess my experiences in the congregations are few and far between because people have been getting so hype on this but it‚Äôs like no one even understands what I‚Äôm implying, because they‚Äôre becoming so emotional about it, I guess? 

I have not said the JWs are a terrorist group or that they‚Äôre for sure headed in that direction. I know the JWs are actually on some hippie ass shit sometimes and they‚Äôre a tight community when it comes to taking care of elderly brothers or sisters or feeding you for two months after a death. However, all I‚Äôm saying is the group mentality and ideals of cult members and terroristic groups are eerily similar. As with other cults (or what people consider sects if they have larger groups, like with Mormonism and Scientology as opposed to smaller cults) it‚Äôs the same dedication to their leaders. Really, look at the dedication that members have to David Miscavige. Look at the horrible black mailing and stalking they do. Now, the witnesses don‚Äôt do this, at least that I know of. 

However, witnesses and other larger cults follow some other practices that are non violent but equally as abusive and devastating to communities, it‚Äôs just way more silent, and it could bud into something violent in the future given the right circumstances and social/political climates. 

They have the shunning (breaking apart families so they have less tight bonds for life support and security which is essential for human development) and the two witness rule (which allows victims and predators to go without detection from law enforcement).PLUS the evolution of the Watchtower and the changing of doctrines and flip flopping within the publications, who‚Äôs to say in 100 years they don‚Äôt start becoming violent given their persecution mentality and the law closing in on them?

If there wasn‚Äôt any evidence at all, then the statute of limitations wouldn‚Äôt have been lifted for witnesses to report abuse., and the royal commission wouldn‚Äôt even be a thing.

If anything stands in the way of their resurrection hope of paradise, they‚Äôll fight for it. Their entire premise is based on being persecuted. Nothing I‚Äôve said is any invention. People have been talking about this for years."

Documentaries,ffrrlq3,t1_ffq9j7c,1580164271.0,"I don‚Äôt treat them as terrorists, I‚Äôm saying the undying faith they put in their leaders plays a big part in them following through on orders, and depending on those orders can change a cult to a terroristic group quickly. And is their propaganda not meant to induce fear into the general population? That is how they gain recruitment. Their whole thing is theocratic warfare and being prosecuted by citizens, ex members (especially) and government alike. Just consider the possibility of the congregations being split apart by the government due to human trafficking rings, and the governing body assigning machinery to congregations instead of burning evidence, books, and building bunkers and instructing them to hide. Even consider the possibility of instructing them to turn violent towards ex members alone. Nothing is out of the realm of possibility when you have 8 million members brainwashed enough to trust anything the leaders say."
Documentaries,ffrqrtg,t1_ffqls9e,1580163744.0,"I‚Äôm copying and pasting this from another comment I posted: 


The doctrines within this organization change so quickly and only the doubting ones flinch. Given the training they have in theocratic warfare, black and white thinking, etc.. if the governing body feels necessary to change their non-violent policies to violent ones, I would bet hundreds of congregations would gladly oblige if they feel they will gain entrance to paradise. Once a talk was given at a local congregation to me where the brother said if they ask for members phones to go into hiding then you should hand them over no questions asked and go where you‚Äôre stationed to hide. No one thought that was strange. So don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs plain wrong [or never going to happen] to consider the possibility of a cult war or mass suicide from the JWs at some point. They‚Äôre already burning abuse files and propaganda filled with ‚Äúold light‚Äù."
Documentaries,ffrqm9n,t1_ffqio81,1580163643.0,"They do this to fool you into believing they‚Äôre the one true religion so you have nothing bad to say about them. And I‚Äôm not saying the JWs are evil, but the cause they support and the pockets they line, that what isn‚Äôt respectful or kind hearted. Please read up on the governing body and what they‚Äôre doing in regards to child sexual abuse/human trafficking. Most regular JWs have no idea about it. I will say, though, once you step past the facade of love bombing and actually get baptized and spend 80 plus hours a week preaching, it will never be good enough."

Edit: Wow, thanks for the award! I wasn‚Äôt expecting such a huge response on this comment. Please note I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre a terroristic group but that they *could* be given their undying faith to the governing body to follow out the orders they assign."

entp,evu5y8m,t3_cfinbq,1564786493.0,"I'm an INFJ dating an ENTP but we were friends for a little while before dating. The first time we held a full conversation it lasted 8 hours and it was really deep ranging from death to sexuality. The same thing everytime we talked after that. Despite having completely different political, religious, or moral stances, we always had really respectable conversation and found a middle ground. I'm not used to that at all. The only issues we have are really surface area issues that come with any f/t pairings where one may feel their partner isn't showing emotion for something and the other partner may feel the other is showing too much emotion. 

Example: We are long distance. He plays video games on mic with his friends. If I call and hear he is distracted with his game I get really emotional and insecure that I'm not prioritized for an hour or two. He says he can balance both and equally pay attention but understands where I'm coming from so he logs off when we are talking on the phone. 

There is a gentle balance somewhere inbetween where it just..fits. Especially when you know how to communicate with each other. It's as if we enter a discussion over a misunderstanding already forgiving the situation because the space is just really safe and trusting and we aren't enemies or trying to battle. We reiterate until it's completely understood and then we go back to goofing off. We can discuss things such as suicide, mental illnesses, the state of the world at large, and it's really stimulating. I can get really dark with thinking about things and he's just chilling on it, not really phased. It's so nice. 

In my personal opinion, I have come to find dating other (f) types leave me drained because we become too sensitive to each other's issues and that sometimes can lead to codepdency depending on behavioral patterns and circumstantial situations. Being with (t) types leaves me refreshed and energized because they rationalize things when I'm feeling too much. It may hurt my feelings a bit, but I *need* that reasoning when confiding in someone because it pushes me to grow. My partner likes his space and alone time, and I thrive on those things. It just works, but I can see how it may not for some because no matter what personality type you are, it isn't the end all be all."

I had the reoccurring uti's but it had only been maybe three months worth of rapid inflammation and noticible changes. It was the worst right before my periods. It goes away with no symptoms for a while and I get tricked into thinking I'm okay, and then BAM. I need to just get over the good days and make an appointment with a urologist while I have decent insurance. If it's possible to get it done at a minimal cost, I say do it, but if you have no insurance and it's been somewhat treatable and durable at home, then I would wait until you can save or get insurance that will be cost effective."

I have been experiencing a deep spasm and heaviness for about 6 months, had many ""uti's"" before that, for years honestly. However, I feel it is truly the worst it has ever been now enough that I am trying to see a Urologist. 

So, I am just starting as well, but I wanted to add that I have PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder). I am highly interested in other hormonal/pelvic disorders and the correlation with them and  IC. My other and her mother had both IC and endometriosis."
