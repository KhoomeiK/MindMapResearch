I can only imagine how frustrating it can be, however. My only advise is perhaps to exercise to masculinize your body a bit more and don’t take take peoples words personally. It’s easier said and done, I know. But take it step by step each day.

Find traits within yourself that you admire and are proud of and exercise them. Do you have a good sense of humor, are you knowledgeable about a certain topic, etc. 

If you are worried that it may be due to a hormone imbalance or deficiency, talk with your parents or guardians about seeing a doctor about that. 

The teens are/were a strange time for everyone and sometimes it sucks but just push through. I’m sorry you’re going through this and hope I at least helped a little."
NoStupidQuestions,fq9k143,t3_ghmkp5,1589200475.0,"Think of the brain as a hard drive with only a limited amount of memory. Every day when you sleep, you brain decides what memories it wants to keep, forget, or reinforce. It does this based on what is important and which memories have been frequently reinforced in your day to day life. 

The rule in the brain is that not everything can stay nor should everything same. Same goes for dreams. Most dreams we will forget anyway. But if a dream is impactful, seemingly important, dramatic, and/or very much tied to our actual lives, the brain will mark that for at least short-term memory. We may remember it for an hour or so after waking up but as we pass through our day it will quickly diminish.

There are dreams that will stick around us for days, weeks, or even years without us consciously trying to hold onto them because the brain finds then more important."

I’ve seen a lot of these aspects in myself and it can be frustrating.

sociopath,fc5iivr,t3_ee2k7b,1577458545.0,"A mother that would denounce any extreme emotion I had. Sadness and anger in particular. I was punished for crying. My anger was never warranted apparently but hers was. 

I was sheltered way too much and not allowed to venture alone anywhere. It wasn’t until college when I actually had freedom.

sociopath,fc5hx6q,t3_eecmo2,1577458073.0,"I love my cat dearly as well. However there are times every day that he does things that piss me off and I will end up tossing him to the side (he always lands on his feet), hitting his backside, or shoving him away from myself or some place that he’s not supposed to be. I admit I can be pretty rough and there have been about three instances when he seemed emotionally distressed afterward and silent like a child put in time out for misbehaving. I see it similar to disciplining a child.

However, I’ve never gotten the urge to hurt him just for the hell of it besides the times I was fucking with him and I wrapped string toy around his neck and put him in the fridge/freezer a couple of times (separate instances). They’re such aloof and innocent animal that they will literally let you do these things and not give a fuck. Sometimes he’ll even walk right into my fridge because of how cool and spacious it is perhaps and lay in there. The longest I left him in there was about ten minutes and when I open it back up he greeted me jubilantly, rubbing against me and went back inside as if to say “Let’s go again.”. 

I think the urges you experience may be due to the fact that it’s your cat and you technically can do anything you wish to them and violence is so easy to get away with with pets because most of the time they can’t do shit or love you so much they see it as play (depending on how violent you are) or don’t defend themselves as they would against another animal.

The crying ones are even more difficult because they’re usually not thinking straight and will be so absorbed by whatever is bothering them that it’s basically pointless giving them the light of day. If it’s a close friend or family member, I will give the best advice/comfort I can but it feels awkward just watching them cry and not really being on the same page as them."

cats,fbze0u2,t3_efb17w,1577243581.0,"First of all. One litter box may still be the issue. A change of environment can many times come with a change in animal behavior. They may prefer to establish themselves with particular litter boxes rather than sharing. The rule for litter box numbers is the number of cats in the household plus one. However, you can try with just adding one for now. 

Next, the presence of your daughters may be throwing off the cats as well and they are retaliating by dedicating where the girls put their scent most of the time (i.e. their beds). Check to make sure your daughters aren’t being too loud or scaring the cats in any way that makes them see them as a threat. Make sure to show them how to properly handle the cats and allow the cats to approach them on their own. Have the girls use toys as incentives."
cats,fbjnpn7,t3_edq5mf,1576936948.0,"If you snoop around my profile (I don’t mind) you’ll see a lot of posts about her.

I was told by my parents that two cats would be too much work for me, though I disagree, and that I need to give her away. Long story short, my aunt who is a seasoned cat owner has been looking to get a new cat since her other one passed away. So the fact that Bindi will be in good hands has given me some solace but at the same time I want her back eventually. I don’t know if that’s selfish but I consider her as mine. At least in a couple months or within the next year when I leave my parents place I would like her to be with me again. 

I don’t know if anyone has done that. Taking an animal in as your own and giving them back to the previous owner after that person has their shit together. 

It’s killing me inside. I just fed her this morning and had to keep looking away from her because she sucks me in with those green eyes. This whole situation is just debilitating. My eyes are still puffy and heavy from yesterday’s crying. I almost want to run away across the country with my two cats, change my name, and forget about the past. It’s like giving up a child.

self,fbjm3n5,t3_edhtjl,1576936111.0,"Update: Things took a turn for the worst yesterday when it came to one of my grades. I had the first D in college but what killed me inside was that this class would allow me to do a study abroad trip to Greece where I would be involved in shadowing physicians and all the experience I wanted prior to medical school. I was so excited for it and this grade I depended on.

I lost it and I took a razor blade in my desk and went to the bathroom. I sat in the tub and was very close to carving a line down my arm. I tried about three times and the thought of how much pain it would be and how long it would take me to die, held me back. Even more, when I put the razor to my skin the last time, Bindi meowed desperately as if she was saying “Don’t do it.” And Kylo soon started meowing in my bedroom. It was the most bizarre thing ever. Like they knew. I put the razor down and for the first time in my life called the suicide hotline. They helped me through it and it helped me regain some sanity a little. The person was very patient and thoughtful. We spent 40 minutes on the phone talking about the situation.

Shortly afterward I got a call from my mom and she at first scolded me about my poor choice of getting another cat. She then said that “as a mother” she could sense something was going on with me and I was doing things to fill a void. Correct. We went back and forth talking about everything from men to school to cats to friends to life in general. Eventually she helped me feel better.

She told me that I still could not be allowed to keep this second cat as it would be too much work for me. And the long hair of the cat was making my dad’s allergies surface.  I was devastated. But she then said that my aunt was looking to get another cat and that she would take great care of Bindi and that would be able to see her all the time and know she was okay. That helped me even more. Though I could keep her, knowing that she’ll be with someone who will love her was amazing. 

However my happy ending would be her eventually being given back to me. I know people get attached to animals quickly from experience. I don’t know if it’s right saying to someone: “I would like to have this cat back to me when I’m more stable in life.”. I was the one that adopted her and paid that $65 fee and fed her medicine when she had diarrhea and mothered her. I have to talk to my aunt about it and see what we can do.

But anyway I’m better now. My mom said she will care does Bindi for a little while until we can fly her to Colorado where my aunt is. She told me to come home and to decided to come hold Monday after work. So I’m the end, things work out almost completely but I’m more hopeful."

Pets,fb2hnll,t1_fb2g2ou,1576451222.0,I know... I’m praying it works out in the end. Something is telling me it will and the newbie will adjust quickly. My current cat is five months older than her and is still a kitten just more seasoned. He’s very friendly and gently and tolerant of most anything. He’s also played with my friends 2 year old male cat and gotten along with him well. He definitely enjoys company. This younger kitten reminds me of how he was when I got him.
Pets,fb15gff,t1_fazsgj2,1576432585.0,Wow something to consider since I’m getting a kitten Tuesday and have a cat in my apartment already. Both are going to be going with me to my parents’ house for the holidays and then back to my apartment after that. Don’t know how they will adjust to eat other. The older one I have with me now has been to my parents’ house once before so I think he may just show her the ropes (or she’ll stay in my room since he’s only 2 months).
cats,fawz0hv,t1_fawywxk,1576376887.0,Ooh I’ll try that. Thanks!
cats,fawwtqk,t1_fawwlk4,1576376234.0,I know... I’ve been trying to buy he doesn’t listen. I’ve basically given up. He doesn’t care about the consequences so never really learns.
cats,fau297n,t1_fau0oof,1576343717.0,Oh no no no. Our house is going to be mayhem this Christmas. My parents didn’t seem too keen about the concept on a second one (and they don’t know about me getting another) soooo. That would be a dream but I have to wait until I move out and am financially stable before I have hoards or animals. One day.
cats,fau0kit,t1_fatv0ii,1576343286.0,Thank you! I’m on my way to the shelter right now. I called and they said the three sisters are still there!
kittens,fat7xck,t3_ea48rm,1576335560.0,I was about to compliment your beautiful rug but then I realized....
AskReddit,fat2mom,t1_faszxin,1576334069.0,I’m so sorry to hear that. You’ve only had him for a little while. Hopefully he makes it through. Be strong for him.
AskReddit,fat26ej,t1_fat0w77,1576333894.0,"Not sure yet since I haven’t officially picked one out as the shelter is yet to open haha. But if it’s a girl, either Bindi or Rey. And a boy, Solo. My current cat is named Kylo so the Star Wars theme continuation would be cute. Bindi throws it off but I love it too much to pass up! 

Ugh I’m doing all of this behind my parents back like I did with Kylo. But they ended up loving him to death. But it’s the holidays! Give the gift of saving a life."
AskReddit,fat0tm2,t3_eak93w,1576333508.0,"A dog.  But I have a cat, who is the love of my life, (and about to get another today)!"
cats,faszeyr,t1_fasytsz,1576333119.0,Ooh. This is so crazy and exciting. Aaah. I headed to the shelter today (when it opens). Hopefully I’ll come back with his new sister (or brother).
Catloaf,fast68h,t1_faq02zn,1576331137.0,Oh thanks. Good idea.

murdermittens,fao61a0,t1_fanrzoc,1576257974.0,Should’ve been Dundee
murdermittens,fao5zvz,t3_ea42v5,1576257954.0,Crikey! That’s a big croc he’s got there!
AncestryDNA,fao0hg4,t1_fanzjdg,1576254750.0,Yes and I think data in Africa is just wonky because they aren’t getting many samples in general. West African makes sense as my parents are black Jamaicans. But 1 to 44 percent is a huge jump. I almost don’t know if I should accept these results or take them with a grain of salt.
Pets,fantjla,t3_ea4pwg,1576250256.0,"I’m reading these comments and feeling shittier and shittier about even considering this after what this cat has done for me. My parents adore him. Everyone that meets him adores him. He converted dome of my friends who despise cats into cat lovers and they beer through their cat allergies to pet him. He’s brought joy into my parents house when I come home. I know no one would forgive me if I did this to him. I probably wouldn’t forgive myself...

I always wanted a dog as a kid but I got a cat for a companion in college as it’s more convenient. The plan was to wait until after medical school and when my life is more financially stable to get a dog. But my impatient self didn’t want to wait. 

He is family and it would be terrible to do this to him. I’m sorry for this. It’s a dark side of my mind coming out and not thinking right. 

He has his own Instagram (kickback_kitty), he’s smart, he’s energetic, he’s kind, he knows a bunch of tricks... I have hundreds of pictures of him on my phone. I think about him when he’s not with me. He sleeps next to me every night, curls up next to my face when I sleep. I spent almost $1000 on him and even got him a christmas present. I feel pathetic and almost want to cry. He would be devastated if I did this to him. He was in that shelter since he was 4 weeks old... and his brother who took two months to get adopted after him. 

I’m really sorry for even considering this. Good things come to those who wait. I waited 21 years for a cat. One day I’ll get a dog and I’m sure I’ll be glad I waited. Thank you guys."

You have a nice smile, very good skin (though foundation/concealer may have been used), as well as nice, expressive eyes. The hair color also suits you. A lot of people catch pull that dye pattern off."
