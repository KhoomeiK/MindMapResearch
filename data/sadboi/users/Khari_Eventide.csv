You having to message 50 people is a problem of Softcore league, because everyone and their dog plays it and can't be bothered to move for a 1alc item. Since I switched to HC this problem has **completely** vanished for me for years now. 


I'd rather they ban all trade than put in an auction house. If you cannot sustain maps, try to get more bonus objectives done. Or before you slot in new Watchstones build up a pool of maps first. That is not a problem of the game, that is part of how experienced play looks like.

pathofexile,fm866w8,t1_fm7w1aq,1585843554.0,"> Why would you clean up ahead of yourself?

When I said ""Preliminarily killing mobs"" I meant that once the Mirror is activates you want to reach the area furthest from the mirror / the boss as early as possible. Meaning on the way there you only clean up the mobs fairly roughly, and then come back cleaning up thoroughly. That is currently the most efficient way for splinters and rewards.


If the time in the Delirium increased as you kill monsters, it would make sense to clear the entire map from the start to the end with it on. ""Naturally deeper into the mist."" as the theme would suggest, as opposed to ""activate, dart to the end and then clear in reverse."" as is the most efficient currently.

I'm saying given the theming and it feeling like Breach, doing it the current way is counter-intuitive."
pathofexile,fm85p06,t1_fm7kz75,1585843290.0,"""Being timed and nothing else"" has nothing to do with the past league mechanics, most of them are timed in some way. ""Timed and nothing else"", means that there is no way to increase the timer, as for instance with Incursion, but more importantly like with Breach. The time you have in a breach is increased as you kill mobs.


That would make sense in triggered Deliriums as well, as you are fighting deeper and deeper into the Delirium. Making thematic and gameplay sense, as opposed to going in and ignoring half the mobs till you reached the area furthest from the mirror to then fight yourself back."
pathofexile,fm789f8,t1_fm5v8kr,1585816889.0,That and nerfing the yield overall. So with 4 reward types you now go to 3 at best but really rare. And the yield is absolute poop. Nothing like the mountain of loot als Metamorph you fot before.
pathofexile,fm77zgn,t1_fm6vbqc,1585816592.0,"Honestly, I know they said they specifically want the mechanic to be timed, but it being timed and nothing else kinda doesn't jell naturally with the mechanic itself for the reasons you outlined. Also currently the best way to get splinters and rewards is to only preliminarily defeat mobs on the way while only darting for the end area furthest away from the mirror and **then** moving back while cleaning it all up until the fog dissipates. 


So on top of what you said, it just kinda plays counter intuitively as well. And I'm not sure it makes the drops of affected league mechanics  better either. 

If it played intuitively, it would have to stay open as you kill mobs and creep ever deeper into the mist. Like metaphorically **losing yourself in the experience, digfing deeper and deeper into a sea of blood and loot until you get more than you bargained for**.

But right now the game is so damn unplayable, bloody Blight is laughing in the corner.

> I don't think anyone can argue that premise is correct.

I don't know what you mean by that. Sure the game is balanced when you think about what the arguably purely semantic sentence ""It is balanced around x."" means. It means the **game's avenues of difficulty and accessability are set with the idea in mind that you can and will use trade.** And there you don't have the word ""balance"" at all, using that word is just to convey a similar meaning in less words used, or to simplify the sentence structure. Don't get hung on the word ""balance"" by itself like that.

Secondly, no game is perfectly balanced, if that is even achievable, and then the question is ""How is that balance looking like?"" If you mean ""Balanced = Everyone is / can be equally strong"" then I have to shoot you down, that might be what you want to achieve in a competitive PvP game, where you want players to have around equal character strength so that only their individual ability and tactics decide a match's outcome. 

But this is an Action RPG, and one made very meticulously to get people to really think about what they are doing and try to create the best possible character. For that there needs to be shit builds with shit items and shit trees. 


You are getting too hung up on the idea that ""balancing around something"" means that the finished product needs to be perfectly balanced."
pathofexile,fm1frb5,t3_fruftw,1585677598.0,"In effect this game would absolutely stink even more with an AH and **the changes that would come down the line because of it.** but people don't want to think about systems and how they interact with one another, and what a seemingly tiny change could do to a game or the developers vision. They want instant gratification. 

Yeah, the current situation is odd (although still better and easier than what the hell Warframe does lol), but I'd fight tooth and nail to avoid an auction house. I'd rather they delete all trade (which would be horrible right now) than bring in an auction house. 


What I moreso deem an issue right now, is how bad the game has become at telling the players that it is okay to not clear all and every kind of content. Uber Elder was created for the 0.001% of the playerbase that needed a big challenge with equally rare and valuable drops. The random Joe (including me) is not suppose to just steamroll Uber Elder. This is not modern game design ala WoW where somehow you can always get to see all ""content"". Something might always wait on the horizon for you, something you can still see one day. And if you are not trying hard enough to achieve it, you are not achieving it.

I play this game on and off since the closed beta, and regularly since Talisman, and there is ""content"" I have either never done or never completed, like the aforementioned Uber Elder, Chayula, 4 Way Legion Battles, two of the Delve bosses, and I am unlikely to try the Simulacrum this entire league. I now play HC, so some things I am unlikely to do unless I want to risk my character. 

And that is okay, things are allowed to still be on the horizon, for there to be things you still strive for (especially in a multiplayer game). I trade comparatively little currently. If I jumped over my anxious shadow more, I'd likely make more currency, get better items and clear more content. Given that I am not doing that right now, I feel like it makes sense that I am exactly where it makes sense for me to be in the game.

And it's the same with trade. If we cannot push this anymore with third party software (people trying to make something more efficient by using their moxie is exactly who this game was made for to begin with) then we are down to the human element. 
Can you use the systems as they are presented to you, or can you not? It's still a video game and not a movie, a video game that is always online and with other people (SSF is not Singleplayer, it's a challenge mode) ""Let me play how I want and cut the line when I wanna."" is not how Multiplayer games work. That makes them special. And that is also kind of the appeal to many people.

I would bring the game back down to the ground and make it less convoluted (as opposed to more so).


It used to be that if you found the game too easy / made it through the tutorial mode nicely, you go and then play HC. But those leagues (including SSF) keep bleeding players. And they openly admitted to balancing around SC now.

At the time I criticised them saying / doing that, and these weird nerfs kind of show what happens when you go for maximum clearspeed and rng gatekeeping of bosses for so long. This is the Game and the playerbase you create. PoE 2 could be great for good old HC-style PoE gameplay, or it could make matters worse."

This is gonna pidgeonhole people to using these modifiers mostly for melee weapons (since you don't have to link them in 3 billion fusings), and Melee wasn't exactly buffed this league. Although I will admit the new Claw Notables look swell."

Nerfs for... Arctic Breath? Why? Not just has this ability never been good, even with the rise of the Cold DoT archetype it was mega shit. 

> Animate Weapon

I hate the reduction from max 50 Blades to only 14 at gem lvl 20. Even if they do 3-4 times more damage now or something like this, you having a bazillion of these blades used to be one of it's biggest strengths. Especially for poison builds. Now it's glorified Summon Skeletons.... yay..

So the baseline max Area went from 23 to 29. That is pretty big, and with the buff to Spell Totem Life, Pizzasticks become interesting again.

VaushV,fk2e5hv,t3_ffkt0b,1583799035.0,"Destiny is getting as unhinged as these Warren supporters, not understanding single thing about the left.


In any way he is pretty wrong on a lot of things here, but especially the following:

> All those Bernie bro's thinking ""Peter was right about those damned blacks [...]""

No really, the left often consists either of sociologists or people well endowed enough in the topic to understand that this isn't simply ""blacks bad"". Really the topic is a bit more indepth and has more to do with who Obama was and what he meant to the black community. Outside of that, yes, a lot of people do not know how good Biden's policies will be for them, but that hits blacks and whites all the same, it's a mixture between the Red Scare and not teaching a class conscious that plays into that, and even that doesn't speak to half of it. None of this can be explained with ""blacks dumb"" or ""blacks bad"", and it's such a shitty thing to say for him, since he SHOULD know better.

> At the same time, America says goodnight to Bernie's revolution

The funny thing here, is that it shows how out of touch with the current political landscape he is. So far Bernie made gigantic masses of previously non-politically interested or only somewhat interested people start to become political and canvass for him, and not on bloody Twitter. The amount of especially young people that went to campaign for him is staggering. But not just young people, many people went in and actually listened to his proposals. We went to no-go-term ""Socialist"" to a point where you can defend it even on FOX news. Every day, more and more people start to come out of their shell and start reading theory. We have more lefty outlets and lefty groups than ever before. The Left is growing every day. 

Whether or not Bernie wins the nomination, America is currently being Breadpilled in Real Time. If Destiny thinks Bernie is a radical little outlier, he is severely wrong.

> If you wanna be really sad, this was Bernie's last chance, too, he's way too old to run next cycle.

Bernie? Maybe. But the left in America isn't just one person. There are AOC, Ilhan Omar and Shahib Buttar. And the list is fucking growing now that we had our entrance. This is far from over, especially if you add ontop of it the every growing environmental movement, that will not get weaker, they will get louder because the issue they are dealing with is becoming bigger every year. If Destiny thinks this is over, he is sorely mistaken.


The rest is Destiny shitting on the idea that Bernie is being blocked out / suppressed by the media, which isn't really contentious if you have any experience with media analysis, or just happen to remember how the media treats different candidates. 

Then we have a couple of callous comments about how M4A will be good for the Bernie Bros on suicide watch, which pretty much only speaks to how much contempt Destiny has for people that want political change. He seems to hammer home this idea that Bernie Bros are just angry white people online that want to larp as guerilla socialists (likely the reason for his contempt), by which he completely misses the structural problems America has and that he personally **KNOWS ABOUT**. 

The comment about Hasan is just plain weird. And I have no real reply for it. Now this might be a mixture of envy over Hasan having like 2-3 times more viewers than him, him feeling somehow betrayed by Hasan, or whatever other reason (any idea I have will be seen as callous either way), it just is weird to literally claim that Hasan is apparently white, so he might be about to drop N-words on his community.
