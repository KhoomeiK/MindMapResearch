VinylReleases,fpxg2nd,t1_fpxfsb9,1588982012.0,Made my night thanks for doing the community a solid!
VinylReleases,fpxf2hp,t1_fpxcpik,1588981448.0,Dude thanks!!
VinylReleases,fpsj6j5,t3_gf9eds,1588874363.0,Damn. Missed it by minutes :/
TheLastOfUs2,fp5qrzf,t1_fp59hu0,1588337690.0,"That‚Äôs a good point. I guess what I should‚Äôve said is wait fo the game to be released and see what it‚Äôs merits or flaws are within the context of what the creators and artists intended. 

But, the problem is that this sub is *also* making this political. If you really think that Ellie having a girlfriend is some SJW pandering then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. There‚Äôs nothing inherently political about what has leaked. It might be bad storytelling but I fail to see what is political about it.

And it‚Äôs no excuse for this sub to insult a group of people for their sexualities. It‚Äôs toxic as fuck."
TheLastOfUs2,fp2d7vv,t1_fp2cvlp,1588259721.0,"Oh! And I love how this sub wants to be taken seriously and not viewed as a bunch of angry, angry human beings yet you can't go 5 comments without seeing the word ""tranny"" written.

It's honestly a whole lot more embarrassing than this game's plot."
TheLastOfUs2,fp2cvlp,t3_gac583,1588259545.0,"Or you could wait and see the entire context.

My God. The hyperbole on this sub is sickening.

I'll say the leaks don't sound good but don't let that undercut the immense amount of work that went into the game.

If you play it and hate it - that's fine. But being angry before you even play the damn thing is mind boggling to me."

nintendo,foakobo,t3_g6aegh,1587648262.0,"Hmm if I had to pick I would probably go with Persona 4 Golden. I played Persona 5 first and absolutely loved it! Enough that I went and bought a Vita and Golden a few days after completing it. I think maybe it was because I was expecting a ‚Äúlesser‚Äù experience compared to P5 or something but P4G absolutely sucked me into it‚Äôs world. I played in all of my down-time. The music, the small town vibes, the story, and the characters were all so lovable. I felt like a part of me changed forever after the credits rolled. Thanks again for doing this!"

PresidentialRaceMemes,fn24mzs,t1_fn236kl,1586577729.0,My point being they are hedging their bets on a candidate that will maintain their status quo while being exciting enough to actually defeat Trump.
PresidentialRaceMemes,fn21u5h,t1_fn20xed,1586575634.0,I wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs their end goal but it would certainly be a nice bonus if they could defeat Trump while protecting their corporatist interests

VinylCollectors,ff7xxab,t1_ff7w05w,1579660990.0,"No - I‚Äôm sorry if I came across like a dick :/ I‚Äôm not a fan of flipping either but some of these *are* recent but because of that I haven‚Äôt built up that much of an emotional attachment to them... thus making it easier for me to let them go. 

Thanks for your understanding!"
VinylCollectors,ff7qmy0,t1_ff7ni1h,1579655990.0,Thanks. I really appreciate that and I think that‚Äôs great you just wanted to learn more about VGM!
VinylCollectors,ff7l3qr,t1_ff7k8h3,1579652120.0,"And additionally, not all soundtracks are chiptune, obviously! Check out Nier or Persona or even the Last of Us and you‚Äôll see how much depth and emotion this medium can possess outside of memorable melodies and energetic instruments!"
VinylCollectors,ff7k8h3,t1_ff7j2pr,1579651518.0,"Oh, no worries. I collect them because video games are my favorite medium and the soundtracks mean a lot to me. Not only do they encompass sooo many genres they are tied to so many memories of mine. The artwork is cool, too - as is the community. And since it‚Äôs such a niche community these records are hard to find. I have about 60 or so that I‚Äôm hoping I don‚Äôt have to let go of anytime soon but these are the ones I‚Äôm trying to sell as I search for a new job."

underthesilverlake,ff50i2w,t3_elq9a7,1579576953.0,"Personally, I think it represents Sam‚Äôs avoidance of responsibility. As someone who struggles with depression I often have a feeling of ‚Äúbeing watched‚Äù and judged when I feel lazy or I‚Äôm putting off doing something. This is personal but the deadlines in this film (Sam‚Äôs dwindling money, when his rent is due, car payments, etc.) are things that are in everyone‚Äôs mind but are often avoided if they aren‚Äôt able to pay them off. We run from these boogeymen. The ending of the movie goes pretty well with this since I think it represents Sam growing up a bit. Just my thought!"

MrRobot,fbwik9x,t1_fbwhzxn,1577150859.0,During the show overall? Or the final season? I can buy that at first but his only plot relevance this season was to be appointed CEO of E Corp and that quickly become irrelevant. He alerts Elliot and then they have their little Christmas adventure but it could‚Äôve been done with any other character. Just felt like he didn‚Äôt fit in very well with the ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù so to speak.
MrRobot,fbw1ncy,t1_fbw1cuf,1577139243.0,Yes my bad - talking to rainydistress
MrRobot,fbvwqp0,t1_fbvp06w,1577137198.0,I didn‚Äôt know being molested and abused when you were a child by your father makes you a ‚Äúpussy.‚Äù How do you watch and appreciate a show like this while missing out on the empathy that is tied to making this character work in the first place?
MrRobot,fbvw9u0,t1_fbvrxfq,1577136997.0,"I mean... everything that happened was ‚Äúreal‚Äù in terms of the hacks, deus group, white rose, fsociety. Other than the morphine withdrawals, the tv disassociation with Alf, and the last loop that we saw in the final few episodes... everything was in reality. The rest is ‚Äúreal‚Äù in the sense that it happened internally (in his head) and had emotional repercussions for Real Elliot and Mastermind. 

Hopefully that helps."
