bipolar,fr5wztb,t1_fr41j05,1589916067.0,Thanks
shia,fr18w7k,t1_fr0804f,1589815448.0,"I am so sorry that they do this to the hazara people. You guys are targeted easier because you also look different. Btw, I'm not trying to be offensive. I'm Afghan too and I despise this just as much."
CollegeEssayReview,fr0abe1,t1_fqzxbsz,1589788715.0,Private message. Yeah you can if you want.
insomnia,fqzrbsq,t1_fqyvy0i,1589773555.0,"I've tried the breathing techniques and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't do anything. I've tried listening to stories and relaxing music too but their are times for me which happen a lot where I can't even get 2 hours of sleep. I have chronic insomnia bit also ADHD and anxiety. My anxiety only gets the best of me when I'm really physically sick and/or when I'm unable to get much or any shut eye. Have you ever went through a month or more without sleep. It is the most terrible thing ever. You feel like you're losing your mind slowly, it's terrible and no one wants to really help. Sometimes pills don't work. I've tried therapy too and that doesn't always work either. I've tried sleeping on time, not eating right before bed, and not using my phone and reading a book before bed but it doesn't really work for me that well. I have other mental health issues too so it might have to do with it. But my Insomnia got so bad once I was about to buy Ambien from India. It's a terrible thing to deal with. I do appreciate the advice and will try and implement these things again but it doesn't work for everyone."
AskDocs,fqx2eyq,t1_fqx1dky,1589724207.0,"I know. I usually do check it but not as much as I have been now. Last time I did this was maybe in like 2015 or something. Only reason why I've been doing is because whenever I feel a certain way I check it and when I get dizzy I check it because for some reason my BP has been low and I'm afraid if it goes any lower and I go to sleep, I'll die. I just wish I could have this issue figured out. My bp is usually never low like this unless the food I have eaten has had lots of garlic in it. I'm just really scared. My doctor told me yesterday that if she could she would burn the machine.

It's very abnormal for my BP to be low like this."
AskDocs,fqwxqzx,t1_fqwwsw4,1589720742.0,Yeah but every year I've fasted I would never get like this regardless.
shia,fqwtdr5,t1_fqnj25w,1589716980.0,I'm a female but thank you so much. I did a lot of a'maal and prayer yesterday and I hope it all counts. I was sick for a couple days and still am but I'm trying to fast. If I keep breaking them due to my issues I'm going to have to make up many days.
AskDocs,fqwbpib,t1_fqv4bbg,1589698837.0,Yeah but why do I keep feeling weak and dizzy then? It's scary. I think I have hypoglycemia because when it comes time to eat I'm shaking and extremely anxious.
AskDocs,fqu1pe6,t1_fqtnvky,1589650314.0, No it's not. When I'm sleepy and tired and drowsy it's been getting low like 90s over 60 to 70s.
AskDocs,fqt1s5k,t1_fqt0xtw,1589627008.0,I'm not taking it anymore.
AskDocs,fqt192e,t1_fqt0osk,1589626462.0,Okay
shia,fqsc6hw,t1_fqsc224,1589603439.0,Are you sure?
Antipsychiatry,fqlp4if,t1_fql3y6m,1589463331.0,What do you mean by annoy them. I got 3 separate diagnosis but when I asked the case manager about having it revealed to everyone. She told me that no one else even other medical professionals can't know my diagnosis unless I tell them. Is this true?
privacy,fqjsj28,t1_fqink35,1589414567.0,When I get really knee deep into computer science I will try to attempt at making apps like that.
insomnia,fqjhp94,t1_fqjceys,1589410082.0,Ugh that really stinks. I feel the same too.
insomnia,fqjc89s,t1_fqj4p5e,1589407911.0,Thank you for caring. It was very scary. I really thought I was gonna die soon. Sometimes I still do when the insomnia gets really bad.
shia,fqi2pw7,t1_fqhy4a7,1589388828.0,Why not?
privacytoolsIO,fqhsb52,t1_fm3qvi6,1589383476.0,Same!
privacy,fqhs487,t3_giw8ub,1589383354.0,"It really does suck. I hate going to offices and would love to do it all online. But the things that they use are not protecting my privacy. For example zoom or something else like Microsoft maybe. They can't protect what I say. It's not in encrypted end to end at all. It sucks that if you want help you have to give them all of your information and I think you can go to jail if you give a fake alias or something, idk. We're basically selling our souls to the devil with companies and stuff. If I have a psychotic break for example, I might not be able to get jobs in the future because they will probably know. When emppoyers search your SSN they can probably see if you've been in a psych ward or not and it's not really any of their business to know. I mean if I was a danger to someone else it would've been sought out by now ya know. It's why I also hate going to therapy knowing that the computer they are using is probably listening to everything I tell the therapist. Even if I don't have my phone she will. It sucks. We have 0 privacy now in regards to sensitive information especially with mental health settings."
insomnia,fqcit19,t1_fqc8a5t,1589259315.0,It's okay. Idk some people did. I was so scared. It was terrible.
insomnia,fqcirt9,t1_fqc77dr,1589259288.0,Idk people are stupid. They definitely got a lot of downvotes.
insomnia,fqbsdob,t3_ghu1uv,1589242988.0,"I rememeber posting on r/askdocs and some people told me that I might have that disease. I got so scared that I actually went to the hospital. Also, people were telling me to go to the hospital because I wasn't sleeping well for 30+ days. It was terrible. Thought I was going to die. I almost got admitted to the psych ward that time because I went to the hospital 3 times in one week. Thank God I was told I wasn't dying. Someone recommended I use bird antibiotics to help me sleep and I thought of getting it but other wise people told me not to. Crazy the advice some people give."
selfharm,fqa0rjg,t3_ghcydv,1589210732.0,Yup. It's happened many times.
shia,fq57mbd,t1_fq4og4m,1589095196.0,Jinn posession is real. It's in the history.
mentalhealth,fq536gm,t1_fq4nstm,1589091077.0,Oh okay. Well they haven't given me anything for it for now. I was supposed to get the sleep study at the clinic but they closed it cause of COVID. Im waiting for everything to sort of go back to normal where I can actually get it done this time.
mentalhealth,fq4kad4,t1_fq4e77p,1589078834.0,Idk. If I do have BPD medications won't fix me. I don't think I have bipolar at all or schizophrenia but I do have anxiety and ADHD. That's a known and obvious.
askdoctors,fq3hth8,t1_fq3g4u4,1589066600.0,DBT is for BPD.
shia,fq227jf,t1_fq1zdq7,1589052171.0,I can't. They'll think I'm crazy. I've already done stuff. Drank water that had surah fatiha in it 8 times And drank it. I read a bunch of dua's to get rid of evil spritis and to get them out of me. I also read forgiveness duas too.
shia,fq1yq0k,t1_fq1xjk3,1589051243.0,It's demons. All my issues are related to that. I was better person then and now I'm terrible. THEIR DEMONS IN ME I SWEAR!
shia,fq1yhex,t1_fq1xh8t,1589051180.0,No no no. I believe in exorcisms but my dad doesn't he thinks it's fake. Also I don't need anything for my anxiety. The reason I'm having all these problems is because theirs demons inside me. I wouldve been religious and good and stuff if I didn't have these demons go inside me. It's a punishment from God that I have these demons in me because of all the terrible things I've done. Please tell me how to remove the demons! Please!
askdoctors,fq1v6ll,t1_fq1tvqg,1589049816.0,"Ty. They told me I have bipolar 1 moderate, unspecified schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, unspecified anxiety disorder, and r/o BPD. 

I don't think I have any trauma history. My family loved me. I self harm but due to many different reasons and just because I do doesn't mean that I automatically have bpd. I think it's the latter, I'm not getting the right care. I just want them to figure out my issues and fix me! It's what I want!"
shia,fq1ugi4,t1_fq1qn1y,1589049507.0,"I'm just saying that I have demons in me. How do I take it out? I've done lots of bad things. I had to break fast today because I was having an episode of anxiety and other stuff. So I took an anxiety pill with water. I broke my fast! Again! I used to be really religious person pray extra prayers not listen to certain things etc. I'm different. I'm not me. It's someone else in my body. This is not me. I don't have all these issues and also have thoughts of not wanting to pray anymore and not fast and I did a bad deed today too. Really bad. And sometimes I want to take my scarf off and feel beautiful. I want tattoos. Yes I'm a girl. Anyway, I really want this. I NEED THE DEMONS TO COME OUT. Please tell me how to get them out?! I asked my dad who's a scholar he doesn't know how. He also doesn't think that exorcisms are real.  Tell me please! I'm sick of this! I'm sick of not being myself. Please!"
askdoctors,fq1teul,t1_fq1ser3,1589049043.0,The bpd wasn't diagnosed. It said r/o. I don't have issues with the therapists. They just don't really know how to help me and never do. It's all talk talk talk.
askdoctors,fq1ns1j,t1_fq1c22n,1589047314.0,Meds are not the answer and their has to be some kind of therapy where it's not just about talking about your issues and venting.
askdoctors,fq1ag3p,t1_fq1920p,1589043797.0,I know. Like I said I've seen 12 or 13. Did you not read my post?  I stopped going to the last one because I don't think she was trying to help me. It was just talk therapy. I don't want someone to vent to. I want someone to fix me.
askdoctors,fq17woo,t1_fq17jhb,1589042984.0,Getting the right diagnosis means you'll get the right type of treatment and I haven't been getting that. You cant help me if you diagnose me as bipolar and give me meds when I really have bpd. I went to a sleep specialist when nothing was helping with my sleeping issues and they told me to go to the psychiatrist again cause they thought it was related to bipolar. I went to a new sleep specialist she ruled out sleep apnea. I have to see her again soon hopefully to reschedule my sleep study at the clinic. It got canceled because of COVID.
askdoctors,fpz1f6e,t1_fpy2x5k,1589011741.0,Yeah I know thanks. I don't want to stop. I've worked out in the past and it doesn't give that same feeling automatically. Cutting releases those good feeling chemicals automatically. If I could I'd smoke weed but I can't cause I live in an illegal state and I live with my parents. I could get it for medicinal use but it's really expensive. I just asked on here why I felt happy after. Because I don't think I usually feel that.
selfharm,fpj8p3b,t1_fpj0m41,1588659985.0,I'll try not to but I do feel like one
selfharm,fphqwld,t1_fphm6tj,1588626158.0,Honestly same. I don't always bleed unless I'm really having a rough time. Sometimes cutting without bleeding is enough for me because I still feel the release.
selfharm,fpfz0kh,t1_fpfxd9k,1588588799.0,That's exactly what I do. I take pictures to record when I do it and proof. I also like looking back as well.
selfharm,fpftpdr,t1_fpftl5u,1588583123.0,I'm glad im not weird like that. Ty for replying.
askdoctors,fp7anam,t1_fp71kb3,1588367069.0,Ah okay. That's understandable.
askdoctors,fp6emh5,t1_fp6bcok,1588351019.0,Thank you. These diagnoses were made by psychiatrists just so you know but because I wasn't there long enough they wrote a bunch of stuff I guess.
askdoctors,fp4y79b,t1_fp4u9ub,1588310574.0,Well my case has been closed for both the therapist and psychiatrist. I already asked the case manager or whatever she was. I might talk to her about it tomorrow. She said if I had questions about the documents I  could ask her The last person I saw was alos an NP. I'm trying to find a new therapist soon to help with my sleeping issues. I think these diagnosis are totally wrong.
askdoctors,fp4twk7,t1_fp4qs2j,1588307282.0,I know what it means. I'm just confused as to why they added unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder AND they wrote bipolar 1. They didn't write schizoaffective disorder.
askdoctors,fp4q7p5,t1_fp4jx11,1588304712.0,I'm just really confused
PS4,fp4jde8,t3_gax3ds,1588300334.0,Can't wait for this game to come out.
askdoctors,fp4c6ka,t1_fp3ho3z,1588295946.0,"Okay, thank you. What about the two diagnosis. Can you have both at the same time?"
mentalhealth,fovrk7z,t1_fouw76e,1588106296.0,"Yes. I've had many bad experiences in the past. Most of them are unprofessional, unhelpful, and never take in my way of thinking. They don't recognize my point of view."
bipolar,fovrdm8,t1_foucudt,1588106206.0,I've had symptoms of low motivation and thoughts of suicide as well as trying to act upon it in the past but I don't think it's depression.
BPD,fotxyel,t1_foqnu7z,1588070093.0,Please talk to me. I'm sorry. I'll listen and I got my chart and it says that I don't have a diagnosis yet because I didn't see the psychiatrist or therapist enough.
insomnia,fotw0a0,t3_g9ibut,1588068119.0,Happy Birthday! I know how you feel. I too didn't sleep at all on my birthday until I finlally said fuck it and took some benadryl or something.
bipolar,fop9me8,t1_foonrik,1587956174.0,I'm not like other people. I'd probably die there and all of the ones in my state have bad reviews. I also don't need it.
bipolar,fomsxk0,t1_foff4uz,1587902725.0,I don't trust any of the therapists or psychiatrists. You can never really talk about shit that you really want to say. If you do and it's graphic they'll lock you up in a psych ward. I've had violent thoughts but have never acted on them. It's just the fact that you don't know who to trust these days.
AskDocs,fompmet,t1_foje3dm,1587899207.0,How do you think I will benefit from a sleep therapist?  I don't think they'll be able to fix me.
insomnia,fom8xmn,t1_fom8vsu,1587881840.0,"Why not? Their has to be a way where I can fix this with natural remedies, not pharmaceutical pills."
insomnia,fom8svp,t1_folzuv8,1587881724.0,I said I don't want to die. I just don't like pills and don't want to be dependent on them.
insomnia,foly2ys,t1_foluk49,1587873270.0,Ah okay
insomnia,folsdcd,t1_folmjqz,1587869346.0,Okay thank you
insomnia,folsbrc,t1_folmd7z,1587869316.0,No fuck lithium. I've never taken meds. I don't need something that strong.
insomnia,folgj8u,t1_fokwyeo,1587861748.0,I understand but I don't want to take so many meds
insomnia,folgfga,t1_fokkgvc,1587861683.0,Is this a plant and is it otc?
insomnia,folgcgi,t1_fokgege,1587861633.0,I live in a state where weed is illegal except for medical use. I called about that but I have to pay a lot of money to just get the ball rolling with the process and then pay every 3 months $130. It's too much money. I'm in the US btw.
insomnia,folg307,t1_fok6oe5,1587861474.0,Ty. I'll look into those. I have the calm app too. I've used extended release or slow release melatonin it didn't work. Maybe it's cause I used 2-3mg idk.
insomnia,folfq60,t1_fok4h18,1587861253.0,Thank you for replying. I've had my hormone levels checked and they said it was fine. I could ask if they tested for that specific hormonal problem though. Thanks. I have times where I don't even have an hour of sleep but yeah I'll ask.
insomnia,fojxis5,t1_fojx1wp,1587831396.0,Lol aww
insomnia,fojv138,t1_fojui7s,1587829968.0,"I agree. I've used it many times for sleep, including today too."
AskDocs,fojsssi,t1_fojrdls,1587828639.0,"Yeah idk either. Probably nothing. So I'm gonna try and look for one from my insurance. I hope it works. I'm definitely gonna sleep soon because I took an Ativan a couple hours ago and I'm drowsy and then I took something else and that's gonna make me sleepy too. Hopefully, I'll get some sleep."
AskDocs,fojr7xi,t1_fojpz62,1587827675.0,Do you think I should go to the ER. People are telling me to.
insomnia,fojqdvl,t1_fojqc8d,1587827152.0,Thank you ❤️
AskDocs,fojq94l,t1_fojpz62,1587827070.0,No! He was the one that gave me melatonin and didn't help me. He told me to go back to a psychiatrist. I got caught off guard when he asked me about illnesses. I wrote on the form that I have ADHD. Then he asked me and I said I was misdiagnosed as having bipolar disorder. So he then went to say that I don't need any tests done. I hate that guy!
shia,fojpxs8,t3_g7r7lq,1587826871.0,Nice job!
AskDocs,fojpoc3,t1_fojp5vn,1587826705.0,I've gone to a sleep specialist that was also a pulmonologist
AskDocs,fojp5vn,t1_fojoi35,1587826380.0,What does pulmonology have to do with sleep medicine?
AskDocs,fojocx8,t1_fojnvzy,1587825866.0,"But but but I don't want to die. 🥺😥 So why don't we go to neurologists instead of psychologists? Also, how do I find a sleep therapist? I'm in the US."
AskDocs,fojl8gc,t1_fojhiyu,1587823788.0,So you're saying I'm gonna die from something else? I really don't believe that psychological issues are neurological. Their isn't any evidence for that. If it then why don't we go to neurologists instead of going to psychologists.?
AskDocs,fojgcjv,t1_fojehhj,1587820119.0,Can you answer my other questions above pretty please? 😁
AskDocs,fojfq3i,t1_fojehhj,1587819607.0,"Lol I'm sorry. I kind of do that if I'm angry, anxious, or trying to confront someone about stuff or discuss things idk. I should be typing slow because I took an Ativan an hour or two ago lol"
AskDocs,foje63s,t1_foje3dm,1587818266.0,You didn't answer all my questions :( ....I'm mad at you. Talk to the hand lol
AskDocs,fojdzle,t1_fojdbfu,1587818104.0,"Why? Why do you think I need one? This isn't psych related. It's sleep disorder related thats a medical problem and should be fixed with a medical doctor for sleep. Are you saying psych because of my ranting? I apologized, I'm sorry I'm frustrated as fuck. Am I not allowed to be frustrated that I can't sleep. It's not like I'm having bad thoughts and can't sleep. It's the fact that my brain literally can't turn off sometimes, other times it can but a lot of times it can't no matter what I do. Sleep early, eat good, exercise (it gets me more wired and can't fall asleep), no electronics or no blue light, dimmed lights. It won't work. It has to be medical right?"
AskDocs,fojdhsy,t1_fojbkoi,1587817644.0,Sleep apnea has been ruled out already but theirs other sleep disorders that need to be ruled out too. It's why I need a sleep study in the clinic.
AskDocs,fojcwjd,t1_fojccfu,1587817092.0,"I don't need a sleep psychologist, I need a sleep specialist, maybe I have this sleep wake disorder. I need to have that sleep study done asap. I'm just scared. I don't want to die. The therapist I was seeing I quit seeing her. She wasn't helping me. Even if I do have bipolar disorder, that doesn't mean I can't have a separate sleeping disorder ya know. Also, I just took some Ativan. I'm gonna take a nap and then I'll come back on here."
AskDocs,fojc6e7,t1_fojbsxs,1587816402.0,"I know I'm sorry. I'm just very frustrated and I came on here to get professional advice about what to do. That's why I posted on here specifically. I've posted it on r/insomnia too. They've helped me but I want advice and support on what to do. I'm just scared and frustrated. I don't want to die. I'm not saying all doctors are bad I'm just saying they don't understand me. If I tell them and I stopped doing this....if I tell them that I have bipolar disorder and have been having all these sleeping issues, they will say it's related to that regardless of the symtpoms you're having. They neglect that it could be a sleeping disorder too. Even if someone has a mental illness, medical evaluations shouldn't be disregarded ya know. I hope you understand where I'm coming from. My post on here wasn't to hurt anybody. It's literally to get advice and support from you guys. I just ranted and am frsutrated and that's why I said those things. I'm sure you're not all terrible. I've just had a fair share of bad experiences with doctors. It's why I'm salty about them. Sorry. But I still want advice if I can get any on what to do and what you guys think about this situation."

AskDocs,foj57i9,t3_g7q4bk,1587808845.0,Who reported me? I'm literally venting and frustrated and need advice! I'm not suicidal or depressed and shouldn't have been reported! Jesus Christ. You people are ridiculous and mean. Don't know how to help someone when they are struggling.
bipolar,fog7ocn,t1_foff4uz,1587748987.0,If that is true then how come my brain scans don't show anything? I've already told a psychiatric nurse practitioner and others my views on pills. It's also hard to look for a new therapist right now.

insomnia,foe709g,t1_foe6rxn,1587697301.0,That's very interesting. So how do you get tested for that?
insomnia,foe1ig5,t1_fodsqm2,1587694199.0,Ah okay. Is that sleep apnea? Cause they tested all that and they said I don't have it. I'm supposed to get a sleep study done at the clinic though.
insomnia,fo8p641,t1_fo7kyp2,1587601008.0,I've been told to look into that with having bipolar disorder but it's insomnia for me. I also haven't heard it verbally said by a therapist or psychiatrist that that's what I have. I'll try and look in to it. I just feel like I'm being tortured by God for my sins.
