Mahler wrote in German and was known for being somewhat verbose with these, hence the long track titles.

Another annoying thing about classical music and streaming services is that they're not really designed to handle versions of the same piece played by many different orchestras. There are probably hundreds of recordings of Beethoven's 9th available on Spotify, but the system treats them all as separate entities rather than grouping them in some sensible way (partly because they appear on different albums that usually have different other tracks)."

If you take CM, you can still take classes like 108 for combinatorics or 107 for graph theory. Number theory comes up later in the DM series as well, but you can get that in more depth through the 150 series. The analysis content you would ""miss"" by taking DM is also covered later and in more depth in the 170 classes. Ultimately, choosing either one will not greatly affect the math that you're doing two years later, unless you happen upon something in one of the 60-series classes that really sparks your passion and gets you interested in a particular subfield of math very early on.

Personally, I didn't have the necessary background in rigorous math to take the 60 series at all (or the equivalent - when I was a freshman, it was called 50H). I just took 51, 52, and 53 my freshman year and learned proof-writing from CS 103. I still ended up studying mainly pure math and being able to get to graduate-level courses in the areas that interested me.

If you're interested in economics/engineering, the math you're going to need is really just basic multivariable calculus. Actual, rigorous analysis is definitely not required, and any additional math you need is usually taught to you in the econ/engineering classes themselves."

stanford,fpxnicm,t3_gg0vcc,1588985898.0,"Others have given the numbers, so here are my favorite profs and classes:

* Kannan Soundararajan - A lecture with Sound feels as if he's just riding around on a cloud in his library of knowledge, then gently plucks a book from the shelf and floats down to proffer it to you. He's a great explainer and welcomes questions too. I liked him so much I chose him as my advisor.
* Brian Conrad - Conrad is a rare breed - a kind asshole. He somehow makes you feel simultaneously as if you have a full grasp on what he's talking about and that you are nothing but a small child in comparison to the enormity of the subject. He left a big impression on me from the first day I had a class with him - he had memorized everybody's photos from Canvas and was able to call everybody by name without introductions. He can be really intense, but also offers a very kind grading curve that takes into account how hard school can be.
* George Schaeffer - I never had a class with him, but he directed the summer research program which I took part in twice. He's a very kind guy who also cares a lot about opening up math and bringing it to more people. You also get a sense that he still remembers what it's like to be a student, and acts accordingly.
* Mary Wootters - Technically not a math professor, but she teaches some theoretical CS classes that I really enjoyed. You get the sense that she really has fun with both math and teaching - her lecture notes are incredible (and well-illustrated) and she's very approachable in office hours.

As far as classes go, my favorite had to be MATH 120, which was my introduction to abstract algebra. It was the first time I actually saw math as something beautiful - before that, it had just been fun and interesting. If you can, I would also highly recommend taking MATH 148 (Algebraic topology) and MATH 121 (Galois theory) together. They seem like completely different subjects, but the sudden realization that both branches of math rely on the exact same idea (the symmetry group of an object gives you intimate detail about its structure) absolutely floored me the first time I saw it.

Edit: Honorably mention to Freddie Manners, who gets points purely for being one of the most British men I've ever met."

Z/15Z is isomorphic to Z/3Z x Z/5Z by the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The multiplicative group of Z/3Z is cyclic of order 2, so raising any element a to the fourth power gives 0 if a = 0 and 1 if a != 0. Likewise, raising any element b in Z/5Z to the fourth power gives 0 if b = 0 and 1 if b !=0, since the order of the multiplicative group of Z/5Z is 4. So raising any pair (a, b) in Z/3Z x Z/5Z to the fourth power can give only (0, 0), (0, 1), (1,0), or (1, 1) depending on whether a is zero mod 3 and b is zero mod 5.

If that bothers you as a teacher or a student, you could amend the definition to mandate that the two pairs can't be congruent to each other. But do you gain anything by doing that? Is it more useful when reasoning and writing proofs about kites? 

This is stuff you can play around with. Kids often have the false belief that math is set in stone and has been forever.

AnimalCrossing,fnv24x5,t1_fnsmmvf,1587277776.0,"After spending hours catering to my villagers and planning the perfect park, I feel like I finally understand what it's like to be Leslie Knope."
AnimalCrossing,fnv1sp6,t3_g3te6d,1587277469.0,One of my favorite parts of this game is where you can see the artists got a little lazy and just left Japanese text on things. You can also see it on the spines of books in some bookshelves and some K. K. Slider album art.

AnimalCrossing,fnuzi9j,t1_fnuz4qv,1587275469.0,"I don't think I have the capability to share patterns from within the game yet, but I made it using [acpatterns](https://acpatterns.com/) by importing a photo of the original and then doing a few light touchups."
stanford,fnutr2z,t3_g40vdh,1587270859.0,"I came to really dislike silicon valley culture during my time at Stanford. I actually came here with the intention of going into software engineering, but that was one of several forces that caused me pursue a different career. If you also don't like that culture, you can study CS and still avoid a lot of it by sticking to academic research as opposed to internships. But if you really do want to work in industry, it's pretty unavoidable."
