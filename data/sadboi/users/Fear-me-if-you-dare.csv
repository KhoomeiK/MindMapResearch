AskReddit,fodne0h,t3_g6hgtn,1587686835.0,"Have an Aunt (in her 70s) who is the Original Karen. She was a Karen (with the haircut) before Karens were a Thing. Even as a little kid I recall her complaining to the manager at a restaurant.

She’s always on some new fad diet, so always brings her own food to supplement at a restaurant and wants them to warm it up for her. 

For my parents’ 50th anniversary, the whole family went to a family style Italian restaurant (which Karen wanted to try). She brought her own boiled chicken, asked the waitress to warm it up, then wanted separate pasta from what we’d already ordered and asked for it to be prepared specially (butter, no olive oil) all the whole explaining in detail about this new diet she’s on. 

She sends food back. She wants some special thing.

Everything has to be on the side. She takes any and all food leftover, even it’s someone else’s and they don’t want it. She even takes the lemons from the water glasses home! She always has plastic bags in her purse for such purposes. Even if there’s a tablespoon of something left, she takes it home.

Last time she stayed with my parents, she didn’t even eat the leftovers, they were still in my mom’s fridge when she left.

My Uncle has been married to her for 40 years. No one knows how he does it. Well, he hides wine all over the outside of the house so he can escape for a quick drink. There’s some in his barbecue grill. So he “grills out” A LOT.

They have an outdoor pool. One year it got really warm towards the end of May so Uncle opens the pool, gets it ready and takes a swim. Aunt Karen freaks out “because we don’t open the pool until June 1!” It was like 4 days early. She made him close the pool back up.

Uncle is not allowed to go anywhere without Karen. And she cannot get ready to go ANYWHERE without at least an hour and a half prep time. Sometimes when my parents visit them, my Dad will want to go out to breakfast with my Uncle. But they know if Karen hears them, they will have to wait until she’s up and ready and breakfast will be over by then. 

So they will tiptoe out of the house, put whatever car is last in the driveway in neutral, push it out of the driveway, out into the street and down the block a bit, then hop in, start the engine and gun it down the road. The neighbors out walking looked at them Really Strangely.

The last time they did this, my dad told my mom their plan. Aunt Karen was asleep. Mom said afterwards as soon as the engine started, she heard Aunt Karen jump out of bed, run downstairs, calling for my Uncle, then opened the front door and was yelling his name. They were long gone by then. My mom pulled the blankets up and pretended to be asleep when Aunt Karen knocked on her door! 

I should get my cousin in on this. She’s got stories of Fun Times with Karen as well. Oh, I didn’t even mention the Great Nail Polish Shopping Adventure."

It’s mind blowingly large and insanely detailed. And I’m not even a model railroad fan.

And beautiful countryside, amazing public transportation, castles, gilt, over the top Baroque architecture and furniture, delicious kuchen

Also, the juxtaposition of the East Side Gallery and the incredibly modern, expensive new construction directly across from it.

And definitely NOT walking in the bike lane."

depression,ezbu0sr,t1_ez5xrny,1567825397.0,"Yes - this exactly! Spouse of many years diagnosed with depression. This is the second episode. I still don’t know what to do other than get him to the doc to adjust meds and suggest talking to therapist again. Everything I say or do is wrong when he’s in this state. Words that I think sound reassuring get twisted in his mind to things I never meant. He gets mad when I suggest he not watch or read things that obviously bother him or try to distract him with activities he usually likes. He becomes a completely different person. He recalls past events differently when he’s depressed than when he’s better. It’s a kind of bizarre revisionist history, like his brain is broken. It’s frightening when he recalls events I witnessed very differently. You want to help, but have no idea how, and no matter what you do, you’re The Bad Guy. Good luck, it’s a hard road. I recommend the therapy for yourself and anything else that helps you keep YOUR sanity. You’ll need it."
