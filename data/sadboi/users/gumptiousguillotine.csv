The best case scenario is Honey-booboo where they get some money and end up a little physically healthier. Kesha ended up MAJORLY damaged in the public eye and Dr Luke is just a little worse for wear. What happened with Kesha‚Äôs situation was an abject failure of the industry and the legal system so I really don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre pointing towards it. She will never recover her career.       
        
And actually, there‚Äôs been some very important discussions in Korea about k-artists and the conditions under which they have to work/the scrutiny of the public eye due to a few suicides over the last few years. A lot of people are driving for change in the industry which has already  improved dramatically for artists in the last few years. There‚Äôs plenty of outrage there, but you‚Äôre not there so you don‚Äôt know about it. When are stars kill themselves we just get sad for a few minutes and no major discussions or changes come about."

For the whole 12 years of my schooling. At one point I stopped saying anything about it because I knew they wouldn‚Äôt help, and the schools never did either. I wish they had recognized that it was too distracting for me to focus on school properly and that it was massively effecting my self esteem and mental health. But they didn‚Äôt want to deal with the messiness of contacting parents or actually getting involved.           
More than anything I think a parent should understand how being bullied makes their kid feel, and put effort into making it stop. Contact the parents, nag the school until they do something, just put in some effort. I wish my parents had tried more."
