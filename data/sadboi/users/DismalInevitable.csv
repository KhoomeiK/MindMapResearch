I would do it myself but i never go through with it. The thought of doing it just brings me a moment of peace that i can't seem to find anywhere else. I'm 31 and a complete failure I don't know whats keeping me here but something does so i just try to make it through the best i can its all we can do
depression,f8uki59,t3_e1zc9s,1574832495.0,"yea everyday since last October. keeping thinking i cant begin to feel any worse, then something happens and well i feel worse.

depression,f6fw2kx,t3_dr06sn,1572818727.0,"yea, same here. I just cant get a real handle on this thing called life, Im a smart person but simple things i just dont get or cant handle like work. im suck a nervous wreak at work every one there can help but notice my nervousness. Relationships never really had a good one . when i thought i had a good one it turns out the other person didnt feel the same.  I just feel like it was a mistake for me to be born you know"

depression,f4p3qnl,t1_f4mkdnm,1571715152.0,Yea I do the same.  But I also just think about how people will just get on with their life just as they do now
offmychest,f3epz2b,t3_dgpljd,1570883779.0,Yea I feel like this most of the time but mostly when I meet new people. I find it has to do with me be a introvert i guess and i only like talking about the things I like or know about.  I try not to let it bother me to much. I hate forcing conversation when there is nothing there you know.
depression,f3cofyd,t3_dgi0lr,1570826379.0,"I feel you,  I have the same issue a long with also getting very bored quickly.

depression,f2lzr5p,t3_ddn4zb,1570299926.0,I've been doing this exact same  thing for years so i get it. best advice i can give is take baby steps towards the person your trying to be and it wont be easy at all  there are going to be a lot of times when your mind is going to tell you its pointless and why you shouldn't even try to change. its a real struggle for me every day just to do the small things but i feel its better to try at least to do everything we can to get well and just to lay down and give up.
depression,f2fgice,t1_f2ffo2r,1570217355.0,true
depression,f2ff3uq,t1_f2fe67p,1570216593.0,i think ive burned all my friends out lol they get sick of listing to me all the time. ill try the note thing though thanks !
depression,f2fc30l,t3_dd88cb,1570214880.0,"yo i'm the same way i always attracted like the worse people. there cool with me, but everyone else can't stand them lol. I think it's because i have a care free attitude about people and their personalities or i don't care about what they did in their past. people always ask why i choose to hang around people like that but it's only because their the only ones you  care to chill with me and listen. its funny to see cause im a real preppy dude and all my close associates are all drug dealer or have done time for one thing or the other."
depression,f2f7g7w,t1_f2f0vb3,1570212371.0,yea i do that too. i grasp for anything to keep my head above water lol
depression,f2f0bwc,t3_dd76gz,1570207674.0,As long as i can remember i never dream of living to be in my 30's . Always thought i die or would have killed myself off by now. but things in life happen and ideas and plans change.  but i never intended to be  around this long like i said so now im just trying to figure out the rest of my life if im going to be here. because as much as i really want to end it some days for what ever reason i never do. Don't know if that's a sign or i just don't have it in me to actually do it. the future is scary especially when you don't have plans or know what to do with your self . all we can do is keep pushing on as much as possible
depression,f2dkb7a,t3_dczoxv,1570156507.0,hoping i can have the same blessing

lol. I try to keep the head up"
SuicideWatch,f2cn5f6,t3_dcw39t,1570140151.0,i understand. existing for me is so fracking painful i can barley get through the day. If i do feel a little happy i start to feel scared because i think my pain will be worse later. I actually keep a noose tied on my closest door just in case i feel ill do it. But i never do and im just sitting there mad at myself for not being able to do it and not even being able to cry is the worst. the only thing the noose does is gives me a sense of peace  knowing one day i might be able to go through with it. its not healthy at all i know but at my age and circumstance its all that i got close to therapy
SuicideWatch,f2cm27y,t3_dcw3kh,1570139728.0,I can relate I like be social but most of the time im quiet because no one seems to care about what i have to say or they just don't get it. sucks because it takes a lot for me to open up to people. I'm a really caring person well i like to think i am. i always try to go out my way to help people but i never get the same in return. the two people i was able to talk to dont really wont anything else to to with me so ive been feeling really isolated and alone it makes me think whats the point
depression,f2ck9e5,t1_f2cegto,1570139026.0,"that's me all day. im so envious of people who  can just deal with things and get over it so easily, relatively speaking. im cant have a peaceful day. i cant even remember when i had one. and everyone else just cant understand why you cant get better. I often feel its unfair to ask someone to continue living like this just so others like family and friends will feel better. continuing to suffer for them  is really becoming unbearable or im i wrong. i don't know but life really fracking sucks  right now  and its been the worst year of my life so far"
depression,f2chqsp,t1_f2bms7x,1570138311.0,i know right i actually get sick of daydreaming of good times cause i know there a lie
depression,f2azxz2,t1_f2axyxn,1570119966.0,I really didn't realize how many other people do this.  I live in my head so much just to feel good just for a sec. but as soon as i stop my depression is right there starring me in face. its not like i dont wont my dreams to come true its just im in such a deep hole right now i cant see a way out. its suck especially at my age of 31
