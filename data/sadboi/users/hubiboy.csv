depression,ffm95xv,t3_eu1kgd,1580050785.0,"I used to have that feeling when my depression was new, now it's just annoying. Constant desire to end your life and inability to get out of bed isn't something anyone could want. Besides the frustration I agree that being sad can be comforting or even kinda ""aesthethic"",  but we shouldn't confuse it with depression.  
Maybe it depends of how strong one's depression is, though."

musicians,ffl2czi,t3_eu32uq,1580033510.0,"Try to create something completely new. For example if you make rock music, try to come up with some hip-hop ideas. Pretty much, get out of your comfort zone and try something you'd never normally try."
