aww,fqe68mb,t1_fqd7fpi,1589302420.0,we actually named her Lulu from Final Fantasy X 😅
aww,fqe5xlf,t1_fqd5y9k,1589302282.0,"To be fair lulu was sort of a difficult case to begin with! She was over 1 when we adopted her, so she was well into her own ways! She was raised in the shelter and lived primarily in a cage with no contact other than to and from the shelter vet. She also had her back toes broken by someone working there “on accident” when they were transporting her to the vet. Since idk what happened I assume some workers probably weren’t very gentle handling her, which could be why she hated being touched.

I know many cats that took much less time, especially when adopted young! Best of luck to you and your kitty! Im sure you’ll getting cuddles before you know it, just keep showing her love and respect! (:"
aww,fqe5a4r,t1_fqd231z,1589301976.0,"For me, my dogs have been more work than her! I’ve had to actively teach my dogs not to try to eat me after rescuing them, Lulu was more just “ignore til she’s cool with you” lol! But for the most part, dogs tend to be easier and much more social. 

I love all animals, it’s my job to. so when Lulu came across me and needed a home, I took her in. I didn’t know she’d be so difficult though tbh, but every pet deserves love and care so I gave her time and let her learn what love was. Just like people, we don’t all come ready to give the same live we’re getting! 

To each their own! I love my pups as much as I love my lulu. They all love me and show it in different ways and that makes my heart full! And it’s totally ok if you don’t want a cat for a pet! I love birds but would NEVER own one! Lol Sorry you’re getting downvoted, I know you were just sharing your opinion! No offense taken here."

aww,fqcvyhx,t1_fqcug8s,1589270789.0,"You’re absolutely right. One of the best feelings ever! We adopted her as an adult cat who was born and raised in the shelter.

aww,fqcqlxe,t1_fqcn3z8,1589265746.0,"To be honest, I didn’t do much. It started by needing to ignore her and let her feel safe enough to come out, anything else made her hide more.

After that stage it was just slowly trying to get close. I’d always initiate some contact but stop immediately when she didn’t want it anymore. Just to show her I meant no harm and that she called the shots when it came to touching her. It took two years of that before she really got comfortable with being pet and another 6 months before she got to where she in now. We made the biggest jump ever since the whole shelter in place happened and I’ve been home every day with her.

Aw that’s super sweet of your friend. Lulu doesn’t like too much sound so tv and music isn’t her favorite, but I know many cats who enjoy lounging with tv or music, especially when their owner is away!"
aww,fqcq5ub,t1_fqconsb,1589265347.0,"To be honest in the beginning I completely ignored her and let her start to come out in her own. After that I used the “less is more” approach but I would always try to initiate some form of contact. I would pick her up and she’d hate it so I’d put her down gently immediately. If she didn’t want me to touch her/pet her/hold her I would stop right away and giver her her space. When she’d sit far away I would try to sit next to her, if she moved away I wouldn’t try again. It was mostly just giving her space and letting her learn I had no bad intentions and meant no harm. It took a year if that before she started being social. Another year before she’d let me pet her, but only certain areas for a short amount of time or else she’d bite. Around this time we adopted two dogs and I think she realized I protected her from them (they never hurt her she was just afraid of them because they’re big. They adore her and snuggle her now too!) it’s really been these last 4-6 months (which would be year three) that she has become a whole new cat.

I’d say keep it up. If kitty is coming to you for live that’s a good sign! just let her slowly build a bond with you and over time she’ll recognize you as her comfort and care giver. Cats are tricky and can take awhile and sometimes they’re always distant, such weird little aliens they are lol!

Best of luck with your kitty, I’m sure she loves you very much already! It just might take some time for her to be ready to show it more 😊"

All that and it would still leave enough to pay back a loved one who loaned me money when I was in a tough spot a few months back.
