But I'm gonna ask you a serious question. When you read back on the things you write, do you feel good about how that reflects on you? If everyone spoke to each other the way you're speaking to each person who didn't immediately agree with you, how do you think that would change things? This is more something for you to think about than a question I need the answer to."
