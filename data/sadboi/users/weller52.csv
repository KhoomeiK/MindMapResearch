My eating habits for the most recent weight loss was much more controlled, but not super strict. I normally ate between 10am and 6pm, with the exception of a morning coffee. I cut back on carbs and cut added sugar from my diet. I ate a lot of fruit, blueberries and strawberries mostly. There is some amount of protein in each meal, something like an egg sandwich, a protein bar, chicken salad, etc. I ate roughly 1800 calories a day and burned at least 500 calories exercising. I did allow myself a cheat day or 2 a week but I didn’t schedule them. Eat absolutely NOTHING after 8pm, that’s been my biggest crutch growing up."

The first drop from 215 to 175 was done at the end of high school, I kept the weight off until about Christmas when I came home from college. After about a year I learned that I had virtually no testosterone in my system, which was weird for a 19 year old, and they put me on regular hormone injections. I then slowly began to put on both fat and muscle until I hit my peak weight. I got a job that required me to be on my feet all day and began to lose weight at a good pace. Finally, in December I decided to get in shape and started running.
