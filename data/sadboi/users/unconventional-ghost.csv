SelfHarmScars,f655ybo,t3_doj368,1572699294.0,"there is no such thing as a ""real self - harmer"", self harm is self harm. even if it is the lightest scratches purposely inflicted on ones self, that is still self harm. trust me you do not want keloid scars, or any scars for that matter. you'll be embarrassed when people find out and you'll be ashamed. they will hurt and itch and you may go to deep and die. you are not a wussy for not going as deep as other people because that is stupid and dangerous, even though they may not have meant to go deep. i don't mean to offend anybody. i hope you get better."
