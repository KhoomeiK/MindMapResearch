And then in a few months, or a year, give it more thought on what you might want to do, it's almost impossible to decide on a future while deep in depression, so just try to relax and get a rhythm/schedule going, getting up, going to work, come home, do what you do, try to sleep more reguarly, ik for me that working really tired me so I'm usually asleep by 10:30 - 11 compared to the 3-6 am bedtimes I had for a long time. But a steady rhythm you can rely on because you have to go to work where school was more optional, can really help in all sorts of areas, and again, I'm so happy your willing to do this, so many people stay in school when they shouldnt because it is so damaging to their mental health. Leaving school early isnt the end, or the start of an endless cycle of nothing, it's completely a valid and perfectly reasonable option, and it doesnt come off like that but it is, well done to you for doing what is best for you even when there is a lot of pressure from everywhere to finish school.

depression,f9mbavy,t3_e5rsnb,1575449985.0,"Hey, I quit school in my last year due to extended depression, it was simulatiously a mistake and what I needed. I had to be gone from there but it would have been better in the long run to stay, so, I left and got a job, and now that I'm in a better headspace, have decided to do a course next year in electrical engineering and my work is willing to let me work part time while I do my course. Dont feel bad for dropping school, it's not the end, even if it feels like it. I'm with you all the way and you have my complete support and encouragement to do what you have to do. I would suggest trying to look for something a bit more skilled or interesting than fast food, I found that needing and being able to concentrate on something through out the day and having a finished product is really satisfying, I work in marine fabrication. Everyone is different and maybe working in fast food fits your personality but if you are doing it because it's all you think will take you, try going door to door on an industry street, it is common for workshops to want people but not have posted it online, or appreciate your initiative in coming in so they fill a position that didnt need to be filled but might be helpful. For me, some random redditor, ignore that self doubt that says you are useless and not worth anything, I know that feeling all too well and it is one of the last things I'm trying to get through as I deal with my depression, ignore it and take a leap of faith because I believe you are worth something, I believe you deserve a decent job. You dont have to work fast food forever or at all, I know you probably dont believe in yourself, it's something most people on this subreddit think, but I believe in you. Dont trash yourself because you are going to become a drop out, my dad, no matter how distant I am now, dropped out his last year, worked for a year or 2, went to university doing catch up courses and now owns his own business, school can be a horrible place and sometimes you just have to leave, but trust me when I say that it isnt the end, good luck and il try to keep and eye out for your posts because I really hope it turns out well for you, you deserve it"

AskReddit,f0lf57n,t3_bvy9tm,1568714946.0,"I'm in the midst of considering grabbing a bunch of pain killers, downing them along with just under a litre of straight vodka and grabbing a craft knife and start cutting, so lets go with that, honestly came to reddit to see if anyone had advice on where to cut, dont expect to see anything as anyone who knows if probably dead but we can hope, just searched suicide and sharing my story on a few different threads. Been depressed for a solid 7 years or so since intermediate (year 7/8 in nz, ages 12 or 13), frankly the only reason im alive right now is cause of DmBrandon's video on suicide ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IauvReb07w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IauvReb07w) ), basically calls people a bastard for trying to commit death if anyone loves you and im like, yeah, sounds about right, so that kept me going, but this last week ive managed to burn bridges with basically everyone I love, well, mostly, but im so out of fucks right now I just dont care about the rest, ive been living for the sake of living in the hope it gets better but its been 7 fucking years, now im fucking crying, ive been getting worse and worse over time, I used to hide it all, not let it show, not even to me, but this last year ive just given up and told anyone and everyone who asked me if they really wanted to know and then told them how fucking depressed I am and the reaction is usually, fuck, ok, and im like, yeah, so thats fun, im rambling now but I dont care, ive got all night to go, if I survive tonight, il come back and check any replies and see if anything helps but I doubt it, ive lost faith in life, I dont believe its worth it, so why try. I hope you lot have a good full life if its possible, I dont care anymore, ive also got to write a letter to cancel a couple appointments coming up and choose who to give my steam account to, its worth just over 2K nzd. so one friend can be a little happier about this, i dont know. so many things to think about before I get too fucked to be able to, its 10, takes a while to actually die ive heard so I better get started, guess this is the only sub reddit that will hear my story, not very interesting, 17 years old, never had a partner, gonna die a virgin, gonna be remembered as that guy who commited suicide when they were at high school, ive got nothing else to my name other than that, in 10 years il be nothing but an old memory, I never built anything to last, never made a life for myself, never completed anything worth while, broke friends hearts and then killed myself, im nothing and no one to anyone, not anymore. and if you ever remember this, thanks, because maybe thats one more that knows me, that feels a little better somehow, I dont want to be forgotten but I know I will be so whatever, it doesnt matter anymore, nothing does, im agnostic  so either nothing will matter soon or im gonna spend eternity in hell or some shit, right now, i dont care, it certainly feels like it will be better than here either way, good luck with anything and everything you do

Edit: I'm still alive, cool, so that's something, I wrote out my story in another post so if you are curious, go to my profile and find my story, just thought I'd add this"
