If you can stay in some type of safe mental health bubble at home or with loved ones, do so. I see you have to report to work, what type of work do you do?

Do you have a hobby? Do that at home. Stay off of the internet as much as possible (unless there are specific things that help) I think deleting your FB was a great idea.
