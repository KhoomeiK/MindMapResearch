BPD,fisqhio,t1_fiskuqu,1582690616.0,"Wow, thanks so much for the explanation! This reflects my experience too. It’s really good to know I’m not alone. I am quiet type and that’s not talked about as much as the more noticeable “loud” bpd."
BPD,f6rb8ty,t1_f6r2tps,1573098548.0,"Yeah, a la Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, manic pixie dream girl."
therapy,f6e1nru,t3_dr0sc1,1572799183.0,"I'm in a similar situation as you, OP, except both my ex and I are somewhat codependent. I think the resounding answer you'll get is ""no, run away, move on etc"" but I think it's possible assuming he genuinely tries to get the help he needs. In my situation, both my ex and I are now in therapy, so it might be worth you thinking about therapy as well (if you aren't already). Having someone you love attempt suicide is really hard. I hope you hang in there.

I really hope both of our relationships work out and can survive. Best of luck."

BPD,f5g3t6f,t3_dnnxui,1572189395.0,"Don't attempt. I've tried ODing three times this year, and all it's gotten me is 24 day and counting inpatient stay. 

If you can, try to get into a DBT group or at least check out the skills online. They can be really helpful, it was created by a woman with BPD to help herself and fellow borderlines."

BPD,evrpt2t,t1_evpwum6,1564714906.0,"Holy crap, seems like a lot to unpack here.... are interventions still a thing? If you're worried about someone's eating habits, is a BBQ the right setting? And most importantly... how. The. Fuck. Do. You. Forget. To. Invite. The. Interventionee ???"
BPD,ev03a38,t1_euyzpyf,1564131101.0,"Holy crap, maybe that's obvious to other people, but I never thought of it as disassociation. Thanks for putting a name to it. It actually helps explain a lot."
aspd,eun66gb,t3_cgzb7i,1563924742.0,"Yeah, I would stick to myself and stay clear. Sounds like the person would fuck their own career up.
My main goal would be passing as normal and getting shit done. Much better to spend my time impressing the important people and moving up the ladder to earn more."

I was diagnosed with conduct disorder in 2005, ASPD in 2009 and BPD this year. I know lots and lots about Cluster B. I called you out because you sound like you're a suburbanite 17 year old white boy who resents his mommy."

I still feel that way sometimes and about some things more than others, but damn. I am good at being an Edge Lord, but I see you went for Master of all that is Edge. Congrats."

BPD,ers9s9t,t3_c3ipcp,1561206717.0,I started out as more of a quiet one. There were patches of loud here and there. I'm still primarily quiet but my aggressive patches are much more volatile and louder than ever. My advice to you: do not drink alcohol.
BPD,ers63ta,t3_c3icd9,1561201940.0,"Yep, this is me. Some days are better than others, but so far nothing makes it actually stop. It's so stressful and destructive."
BPD,erkrbg5,t3_c2gncv,1560969685.0,Remember that you love yourself more than you love him. Meaning that how you take care of yourself right now is more important than your past with him.
politics,erkqqby,t1_erkq47h,1560969316.0,"I agree with that. Voter suppression and the electoral college have left large portions of the country unrepresented or under-represented. 

I'm pretty sure the country will burn itself to the ground. I don't know how it could recover now."
BPD,erknesq,t1_erkmhcq,1560967240.0,"For Android, in the Messenger app you go to the People page, click your picture and Active Status is an option under Profile.
For iPhone, I don't remember for sure, but I think it's about the same or in the settings.

I don't know about fb settings tbh, I only use Messenger."

BPD,erkbkil,t3_c2ibvl,1560959799.0,"Messenger is the worst for me. Last year, I suspected my partner was going to leave me for someone else and every time I saw that they were both online it would send me into panic/rage/depression. I had to turn that feature off because I almost destroyed my relationship."
