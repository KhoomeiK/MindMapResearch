it’s always possible that i got the flu untimely and with the current climate, my anxiety is just on hyperdrive. i don’t have a family doctor but have called the local covid centre and they told me just to remain in isolation for 14 days. which i will keep on doing so.

as prevalent as mental health awareness is, it’s still heavily undermined and frowned upon. a few of my managers and profs chalked up going to therapy or taking mental health days off as “snowflake attitude”. it can take someone to muster the strength and courage to reach out. it’s also hard to reach out without coming off as faking it or using it as an excuse to dismiss responsibilities. you can’t fake what you’re undergoing. going to therapy and taking care of yourself doesn’t make you weak. 

with that being said, reach out to your family, homies, fellow strangers you come across online, coworkers, etc and take care of yourself. there’s only one of you and the individuals you know."
