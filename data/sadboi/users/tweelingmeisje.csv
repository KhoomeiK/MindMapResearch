WatchPeopleDieInside,fnjgzyx,t1_fnjfjye,1586998785.0,Probably because some random girl called with drama and she wants views? Like maybe they’d been on the phone for a sec and it sounded crazy and paranoid so she was recording to make fun of her. Idk all I know is when I was in high school I’d get weird calls like this from girls I didn’t know and I wish I would’ve recorded some of them. Or maybe I’m just reaching.

unpopularopinion,fnbh1o9,t3_g0o7zv,1586815397.0,"I get why people do it. Deep down I think an alarming amount of people still see women as weak and subservient. When we do something that’s typical for men, or something that men don’t necessarily like for women to do, it’s “brave” but they don’t really mean it as a compliment, it’s meant as more of a “wow I can’t believe a WOMAN is actually doing this. How embarrassing and scary” I’m almost 100% sure that when people call us brave for doing nothing in particular, there’s no sincerity in that. It’s just passive aggressive silly nonsense"
