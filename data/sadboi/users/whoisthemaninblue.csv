That makes sweeping and unflattering generalizations about his ideological opponents, and it strikes me as a glib and disingenuous rallying cry for his supporters more than a statement of substance. He was not very knowledgable about Marxist theory and post-structuralism, even though he railed against them all the time. My biggest beef, though, is how he focused on the toxicity of the left and, despite his claims to the contrary, did not often address the toxicity of the right, especially among his own followers. (And scrolling through comments under any of his political videos will reveal plenty of those people.)

So that is like asking something to be free from itself, which is not a reasonable definition of freedom.

But actually, the will *is* evidence of nature learning to become more free from itself. As far as we can tell, nature was once only driven by physical laws. There were no higher order considerations in its operation. Now, thanks to evolution of the brain and the increasing complexity of thought, abstract ideas are (partially) steering these hunks of matter we call bodies. It is an amazing development.

This is speculative but we know that moving electrons create patterns in the electromagnetic field, which propagate at the speed of light.

Got into weed and had a fabulous experience. Looking back, I started showing schizophrenic traits but they were all good. The voices in my head were all telling me to get in shape, improve myself, reach for the stars, etc.

A couple years in I took acid and 4-aco dmt several times. Those trips all destabilized me.  I didn't get the life affirming lessons or insights that some people seem to get. My trips mostly felt like peeks behind the veil into a universe of chaos. I wrestled with solipsism and obsessive thoughts about the nature of reality. My life seemed to explode with mind-boggling synchronicities, and this disturbed me rather than comforted me. I had one bad trip in particular that wrecked me for a year. I didn't quite lose my grip on reason but my sanity heavily frayed, and it became harder to hold onto the mask of sanity.

I decided that psychedelics were giving me delusions rather than insights, and I stopped. Since I kicked the drugs and refocused my life back on human rather than otherworldy wisdom, my life has improved vastly."

Simply put, psychedelics kicked off a few anxieties that got between nature and me. I loved nature well past my teen years, spent a lot of time alone in the wild, and read a lot of books about science, evolution, ecology. I found nature's indifference toward me transcendent, its blind creativity majestic, its vast scale humbling. 

After psychedelics, I could not shake the feeling that reality is a simulation or illusion and that unity and consciousness underlies the appearance of nature's diversity. It suddenly all seemed hollow and desperate.

To be clear, I believe those ideas are delusions or misunderstandings, and I mostly left r/psychonaut because of their hold on me. But the subjective sense of their truth was so powerful while tripping that I can't shake them."

This is because the implications of the two interpretations are different, and the stakes of following one conclusion or another can be high.

If trips involve external beings from another reality beyond the brain, this opens the door to all kinds of ideologies that can lead you astray into magical thinking and harmful error, even psychosis. If trips are vivid conversations with an inner subconscious world, this is still profound and humbling -- but it lets you keep one foot on the ground and stay in (more or less) consensus reality."
RationalPsychonaut,fatosh7,t1_fatknfv,1576340281.0,"I believe the notion that we are all one, if you don't take it tooooo literally, is a natural conclusion to reach. We all are able to realize that our individual distinctions are arbitrary and accidents of circumstance, though our pride often clings to them as though they make us special as individuals.  I don't mean to suggest that psychedelics don't produce true insights - just that I don't think these insights require invoking supernatural realities. But I am not saying I am 100% convinced of my position. And yes itis fun to think about!"
RationalPsychonaut,fatiqjj,t1_fatg8hn,1576338588.0,"I don't completely rule that out. But to me the more plausible explanation is that:

1) The same switches are being flipped in brains, such as turning off the default mode network, the part of the brain that produces the concept of self.

2) Certain mythic archetypes have been programmed into the brain by evolution in order to shape our unconscious processing. And these are experienced consciously during tripping as these areas of the brain gain access to visual processing networks. (This would also help explain why the same themes often show up in dreams as well.) 

3) Exposure to the psychedelic subculture before tripping will have an effect on how the experience is interpreted, during and after the trip."

RationalPsychonaut,falrugl,t1_faj5z1y,1576189395.0,"I don't think we can know for certain because we are always experiencing reality through filters of one sort or another. But when multiple types of input report a similar picture, we probably get closer to the objective picture. So I am skeptical of taking the visions in trips as reality because they are not backed up by other modes of inquiry and measurement. And sometimes even different psychedelic visions present different stories about the truth of reality. I think science does a decent job, though it is slow and probably gets plenty wrong."
RationalPsychonaut,fai7fdb,t1_fai626q,1576101410.0,"Brain chemistry alteration has been my position as well, though I have had experiences which challenge (but do not demolish) this conviction. I get a wonderful feeling of peace and awe from the belief in a naturalistic universe. The idea of a supernatural universe frankly frightens me, especially since my ""glimpses"" of it on psychs have shown so many dark things. I am glad I found this subreddit where people do not take the objective reality of these trips as a given and instead accept them as powerful, mysterious, but ultimately subjective, experiences."
