I lost my dad a little over 2 years ago, and I was extremely lucky to have people I could talk to and be my rocks to the wreckage I was. Something that really helped also, I started seeing a therapist and also going to a (free) weekly VNA Grief Counseling Group. Being around others who have lost someone helped me feel less alone in my grief. Some therapists also accept pay on a sliding scale, meaning you pay them what you can afford. I‚Äôm telling you all this because I believe you need someone to talk to, a place to express your grief without judgement.
