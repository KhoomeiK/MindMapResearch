Advice,f8xjd40,t1_f8xidjh,1574920705.0,"Thank you! I'm concerned that the professor won't budge on their policy though, especially since the paper is two weeks late. The professor provides a two week grace period, and I stupidly didn't submit the paper days sooner. Also, the professor might think that the claim of not knowing that the module would close at exactly 11:59 pm instead of 12:00 am is a lame excuse, especially in this case. I feel very dumb right now. I should not have let this happen. I turned in the first paper late as well, so I'm feeling hopeless now. I apologize if this is too much information. Thank you again for your reply!"

I have been through both college scholarship interviews and job interviews, and I find this to be very helpful. I think that being calm helped me to get the job that I have now. So, please be calm."
