I try to tell myself it's not real and keep saying that over and over. Sometimes it works other times it doesn't. I suggest giving that a try and telling yourself that is not real. Most of the time it doesn't work but maybe it will for you. I wish you the best of luck and if you need anything ever please feel free to message me

depression,f279kwu,t3_dc88eo,1570033402.0,I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost my girlfriend to suicide a couple of months ago and it's torn me apart. I tell myself I should have just killed myself but I'm still here. Everyday I wonder why. I went to her funeral and was in tears and broken. I tried to kill myself before going to it but it didn't work. So I just went and cried my heart out but I was too much of a wuss to talk to make a speech or say some words. I didn't want to go up there so her dad read it for me.  If you ever need anything please feel free to message me anytime.

overcoming,f2069zl,t3_dbcale,1569855809.0,I lost my girlfriend due to suicide a couple of months ago. It's always hard to lose someone especially a miscarriage. I'm very sorry this happen to you. I'm not the best at advice but I think you should tell your husband how you feel. I've been trying this myself make a list of all the things you want to accomplish and try to complete at least one everyday. It you don't complete any of them that day don't worry about it. Try to do it the next day. I've been struggling with it myself I've struggled to complete my tasks. But I definitely think you should talk to him and tell him how you feel. Tell him everything. Hopefully it works out and I hope thinks get better for you.

overcoming,f1y3kkw,t3_db3db9,1569808744.0,"I feel lonely too all my friends live very far away and I've lost all the people close to me because they couldn't take my shit anymore. A couple months ago I lost my gf due to suicide. I loved her more than anything but she's gone and I haven't accepted that yet. I do the same shit everyday and try to make it seem like I'm happy. Most people hate me I've always just been friends to people. Countless times people have told me stop being a pussy. Men don't cry. Stop being a little bitch and do your job. I'm sick of it all I'm sick of everyone I just want someone I can cry too and talk to and they won't make fun of me. I want someone to like me for me. I look in the mirror everyday now and tell myself three things. I hate myself,I'm ugly,and I wanna be me again. I'm sorry for ranting  but if you ever need someone to rant to feel free to message me anytime. I know how you feel and I'm sure there plenty of other people who could relate too."
overcoming,f1y2q3j,t3_daxtcf,1569808282.0,I know how you feel. I always put my thoughts behind and me and suck it the fuck up as people tell me. I'm always worried I'm just making things worse for other peole. I always feel trapped and alone I feel like I just make things worse for people when I share how I feel. A couple of months ago I lost my girlfriend to suicide and it's destroyed me completely. I'm still fucked up from it. It's almost as if I see her sometimes but she's not there.It always makes me sad the only thing that brings me joy anymore is getting high. It's the only thing that keeps me going but even that is slowly fading away. I have nobody close to me to talk to all my friends are fake and they all tell me the same shit oh it gets better. I always need to be alone and my 2 friends left who both live very far from me are the only people I care about. For 12 years I've always hid the real me from people and I continue to do that. Anyway I don't want to make this a rant but if you ever need anything or just need someone to rant to feel free to message me.

overcoming,f1mz0ki,t3_da1n26,1569605258.0,I feel you people always used to tell me the same shit. Everyone used to take over my kindness because I couldn't say no to anyone. People were always assholes to me but I thought they were my friend and I came to reliaze probably like two days ago that they aren't my real friends. They wouldn't be there for me. For some reason I keep going back to them because I have nobody else. I try and tell myself that there are nice people out there but I have yet to find them. I always tell myself I hate myself and it's my fault people do this to me but I now know that's it not. I think you should venture out and find people that like you for you and if at any point you feel like something is not right don't force yourself to do it. Just keep trying to find people you fuck with and sooner or later you will find someone. I still haven't found anyone personally but don't give up hope. If you ever need anything feel free to msg me.
depression,f1mpkc3,t3_d9swuk,1569599298.0,I do the same thing. I lost out all the things I hate about myself and tell myself over and over again. It almost just becomes something I'm not aware of anymore.
overcoming,f1lct90,t3_d9suhg,1569551387.0,"I've been unmotivated to do anything the past few months. I lost my girlfriend to suicide a couple months ago and it's torn me apart so much. I've reached a point where I can't so anything I spend countless nights crying myself to sleep wishing she was back. But lately I've been trying to get myself back together. So I make a list on my phone. I will look at it when I wake up and set a timer for YouTube,Netflix or whatever and when the timer ends look at the list and try to accomplish one thing per day. Write things you want to do it can be anything. At times I lose hope to do anything and try to avoid the list but I try to do something at least once a day. I don't know if this helps but if you ever need anything feel free to message me."
overcoming,f1jmmmw,t3_d9jxyy,1569525055.0,I have had something similar to this in a way I lost my girlfriend to suicide a couple months ago. She was everything to me so I know how you feel about losing someone that is everything to you. I'm really not the best at advice honestly but if it were me I would tell him all of that. Tell him how much he means to you. Show him how much he means to you. If you ever need anything else please feel free to message me

overcoming,f1c25ss,t3_d8paci,1569348206.0,I feel you 100% I hate myself too. Im excessively nice and all I do is hate it. I can't say no I can't be mean and there's so much more. I even hide the real me from people and it makes me hate myself even more. I tell myself the same thing that Today will be better but it doesn't get better and shit is always the same and every day I still hate myself. You have to force yourself to change I'm still trying to change myself and it's very hard but don't give up no matter what life throws at you. Make a list on your phone of what you want to change and look at it through the day and try to do at least one per day. If you don't complete that item of action the first day try it the next day. I'm currently doing this myself and It's hard but I'm trying to push myself through it just keep trying it. I hope it works out for you. I wish you the best of luck

overcoming,f0w0qiy,t3_d6uup9,1568996325.0,"Hey I'm not the best at advice but I know how you feel. I broke up with my girlfriend not too long ago and I felt like I lost everything In my life my happiness my purpose and everything. I recently tried hanging out with some old friends and it was just awkward nobody really talked so I know what you mean. I feel alone lost and like I have nothing left. I have no friends and I spend most of my days in my life suffering and going to work,getting high,and that's it. Not much brings me happiness anymore. As far as advice try doing something that makes you happy or makes you feel good about yourself. Find something, anything whatever it is. Wake up early and do something find your purpose again. I don't know if this really helped like I said I'm not the best at advice but if you ever need to talk feel free to message me here. Everyone is always here for you on this community"
