SuicideWatch,fgj6m8m,t3_eyjkyc,1580837967.0,"I'm 24. Been very depressed for years and years. When people say "" it gets better"" or "" life is what you make it"" That is all a joke when you cant controls your own thoughts.

I'm married with my own house and my 4 month old son... and no one could imagine how I feel saying this but. Even with my wife and my baby boy they just are not enough to drown out my thoughts. 
It rips me apart to say that. Because I love my family.
BUT our hearts and our brains are very different. My heart is gold but my brain is black and I never escape my own thoughts. Everyone tells me that lifes short but I want to die. An no one has the answers. 
Wake up go to the same shit job making the same shit money and nothing ever gets better. 
I'd love to live a life where I didn't think about killing myself or death every single day. But I guess those were the cards I was delt.  Iv got so much pain in my brain and I'm so lost and lonely. The only way my pain will go away is to end it all...."
