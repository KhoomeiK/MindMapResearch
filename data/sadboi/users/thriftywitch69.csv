nintendo,folva59,t3_g7vuf0,1587871317.0,"I'm looking forward to seeing my family again and being able to get a hug from them without feeling guilty. I saw my dad just to work on my car so I would be able to drive and I felt so guilty because I knew I shouldn't have, but really needed one. I'm also looking forward to going to art openings again, I hated going to one as an artist, but I miss the socializing surprisingly."
CatAdvice,fldwn5c,t1_fldvceg,1585073161.0,"true, true. i was worried about that as well. i always see people's cats just laying on the patio. i was wondering if there was some secret tip i was missing out on! lol

but i think since i have more time from working from home maybe i'll look into templates to build one myself"
CatAdvice,fldwi14,t1_fldswg0,1585073080.0,"yeah, my cat cries to be let out. she doesn't do well on a harness is the issue, and in the past it has been time consuming due to work / etc. now that i have more time since i'm working from home through all of this, maybe i'll have more time to build a catio."
EMDR,fjkc2c2,t1_fjjejv9,1583424299.0,"thank you! i had to miss my last appointment this week, and my next one isn't until the 17th, so i'll bring it up then"
EMDR,fjip8q3,t1_fjct0ai,1583372647.0,"yeah, i think i might bring up that i don't feel comfortable enough with him yet to start emdr right now, but i'm worried he might get frustrated or upset or drop me as a client"
EMDR,fjip647,t1_fjil7lj,1583372599.0,"very true, i just feel like he already has a lot of clients on his plate and my old therapist told him i was doing great before she left. i think anytime i bring up delaying emdr longer he thinks it's me being avoidance (which it may be) but i have a lot going on right now in my personal life and may be moving suddenly so i honestly don't think it's good timing. maybe i should bring up building up the therapeutic relationship first, because i don't feel 100% comfortable yet"
EMDR,fjbl40o,t1_fjbjard,1583195730.0,"i don't think it's an issue with my therapist, i'm sort of new to him, but it was an issue with my old therapist as well that i definitely trusted. i think the avoidance just transferred over. we were going to start emdr (with my old therapist) in january, but she ended up leaving the clinic in january."
BipolarReddit,fj8u67s,t3_fc67ff,1583122321.0,"i don't know if this is normal, but now i'm interested in asking my doc if my pain increase is because of the increase of lamictal i had recently.."
BipolarReddit,fj3oeyi,t1_fj2w2xs,1582989313.0,wait.. you can have a loss of cognitive functioning the longer you go untreated? is there research on this i can read because uh.. i'm pretty sure that's happening with me
pettyrevenge,f6gv1k0,t1_f5z4vqx,1572831165.0,"wait... how do i turn on this setting...

EDIT: i figured it out, it was right in front of my face. this is a godsend..."
insomnia,f5khlve,t1_f5khgtl,1572263531.0,hi! i have not tried that? is that supposed to help relax you? and i have issues with trauma so dim light in the room helps me not have nightmares.
