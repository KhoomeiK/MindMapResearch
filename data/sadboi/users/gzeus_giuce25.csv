Of course there are plenty who dislike him as well, some even seem to have a personal disdain for the man himself for w.e. reason. Hard to gauge which side is the majority but Watchmen, MoS, and BvS do get a lot of love from people. Those 3 movies still have impact and still are talked about and dissected. To compare it to marvel (for obvious reasons) as enjoyable as those movies are most come and go, even Endgame has died down already. Although as an aside  Infinity War was the better movie by far.
Many people like the variety it offers, a completely different style of CBM compared to Marvel. They look different, tone is different, they sound different. Even those who hate snyder and his style are likely to check it out due to morbid curiosity, plus with the pandemic at play and so many stuck at home anyway it should do really good numbers. Don't have to spend a dime in marketing clearly from the manor traction it's gaining. It will be a completely different movie, there is no other new content really being made at this moment just w.e. was already shot. Plus WB loves releasing multiple cuts of films, I think they have done it more than any other studio.

And it's the Justice League, what comic fan doesn't want to see another live action movie? Darkseid live action? Sure people may not like it, but we don't always like the comics we read either, you find out along the way."

Also you missed my point. All WB had to say years ago was ""fuck off no Snyder cut will ever come"" and this would have died down years ago. Would not have been able to drum up support. The fact that they have pussy footed around gave people hope it was a possibility, so they ran with it.

BPD,fqf2u80,t1_fqeb7qi,1589317785.0,"First I want to thank you for such a thought out response, I really do appreciate it. I was worried my comment would be taken as bashing people with BPD. To be honest I struggled with that for awhile, blaming the illness for my exs actions and not herself.
You are right though about both essentially being victims of circumstances because of what causes both mental illness.
The pity/sympathy thing you talk about is surprising because I thought the ""victim"" mentality was a common symptom. My ex was big on it, a lot of public posts about her having breakdowns, being depressed etc.

If I may I'd like to give a brief backstory of what shaped my opinions on BPD, what has made me confused.
My ex and I dated 2 years, the break up was horrible. My ex kept going out of town, said she was depressed and needed to see a friend.  No problem,  I was fine with it. She just up and disappeared for weeks, then finally got sick of my messages wondering where she is and what happened so she finally told me we were broken up.
Then later I found out that time she was depressed she was cheating, that's where she disappeared to before she left, where she was when she finally broke up with me.

I had a complete mental breakdown, just became a shell of a human being, suicidal. Messaged her way to many times, said some horrible shit in anger. She called the cops and they told me to stay away so I did. Was the wake up call I needed because I was destroying myself at that point, physically and mentally. Just became a weak piece if shit.

So  5 months passed and I was doing therapy. Was started to feel good about myself, starting to look good again and get back to routine. Made a few posts on FB about feeling good, and that's when she hovered.
This girl who told me to ""man up"", who spent the 6 months posting horrible shit about me. Who made countless jokes about my mental deterioration, which with all the horrible shjt I said when i found her cheating I never once laughed or found humor in her pain.
So randomly she sends me a letter. Apologized for everything, for cheating, the cruel things she said and did, even for calling the cops. Which I told her very clearly not to feel bad for calling, not at all.
Told me she thought of no one but me, that she has never loved anyone like me. That we were meant to be and wanted to spend her life with me. That in therapy she realized how much she loved me.

Conveniently though this apology came shortly after new guy dumped her. She was likely just lonely and feeling rejected. But I loved her so I ignored that, thought she genuinely wanted to be with me and work things out.

Took about a month to find out she was seeing someone else the whole time, so I ended it. 2 days later she posts about being in love, about how I was a toxic person. Her bf posts jokes about her cheating and they laugh about it. This girl accused me of using her for sex the entire time we were together, when it just wasn't remotely true. This new guy literally posts about how good she sucks him off, and she laughs about it.

All the apologies, coming back when she legally had no right to, and she was just cheating the whole time. So I was one of those people constantly asking for insight from those with BPD. Just trying to understand how someone could be so manipulative or why they would be. How someone can love so hard yet be so cruel, turn it off like a switch. I wish I had that ability, to just stop loving her.
Trying to find anything that could help me understand why this happened, what I did wrong, if this was just always going to happen.
I couldn't understand how someone who takes mental health so seriously would actively try to destroy someone elses.
How someone who I thought was the kindest most compassionate person I met could be someone so cruel and vindictive.
The person I loved was gone, maybe never existed, and I couldn't understand it.

So I am that otherside lol. To give you a window into maybe why some people ask these questions. I know everyone is different, that BPD is a spectrum, that not you or anyone else can answer what goes on in her mind. It's just about finding people with a similar illness who can at the very least shed light on their own experiences.

For awhile I blamed her BPD but I realized that was wrong, it was just another way for me to make excuses for her. To not hold her responsible. To give me hope that she actually cared, that her illness was why these things happened. Even before her letter she made multiple posts blaming her illness for what she did. That it wasn't her fault, she just didn't know she needed help. The funny thing is I noticed, I begged her and her friends to get her help. That something wasn't right, and they made me out to be a monster for saying it.
Yet that was also something she apologized for, was greatful I knew her that well.

Again I want to thank you very much for your response, I actually found it quite comforting."
BPD,fqe22xn,t1_fq44jd5,1589300489.0,"I dunno mine came back after finally getting into therapy and realizing how horrible she was to me. Didn't stop her from doing it again.

Being manipulated, cheated on,  discarded,  they are traumatic experiences. Why hate on people just look for some form of answers some closure? You'd think empathy would play a part."
BPD,fqe1n60,t1_fq32cp7,1589300282.0,"I think people are just looking for advice to explain the unexplainable.
I dated my ex 2 years, then towards the end she disappeared. Just left, no answers. Were planning a future. Found out she cheated, cheated the whole time she asked me to watch her cat.
These aren't normal behavior.
She actually came back, apologized and blamed her BPD for the shittier things she did to me. And I think that happens alot, people blame their mental illness for their immoral actions to avoid accountability. So those effected by these actions look to others with the illness for answers. Just something they can tell them, a window into a thought process that seems so far from normal and healthy.

Most people are smart enough to know everyone is different, sometimes people are just desperate for answers. How any human can call you the love of their life, then completely discard you at the drop of the hat. With nothing happening in between.
It's traumatic, people are just trying to understand the trauma they are dealing with.

She also cheated again after she came back. Repeated the same process of idealize, devalue, discard, just in a more quick time frame.
Again, not normal healthy human behaviors. Not anything I can understand."
BPD,fqe0kx3,t1_fq2py4d,1589299777.0,"Or from experience. Willing to manipulate or cheat on someone isn't exactly empathetic.
I mean it is no more talking out their ass than people with BPD saying they ave overwhelming amounts of empathy.

People are people, some good or some bad. But to deny other people's experiences because you don't like what it may say about a certain group of people is absolutely talking out of your ass.

Everyone is different, but when someone literal follows the idealize, devalue, discard cycle to a T it's hard not to have a jaded opinion.

Those effected by partners with BPD are human beings too.

NPD and BPD commit a lot of the same behaviors like manipulation and infidelity. Both are mental illnesses, yet people with NPD are seen as monsters and people with BPD just helpless creatures effected by circumstance. So which group really deals with stigma?"

Yeah I have to agree, MIB's storyline was always entertaining, so many jaw dropping moments. Like when he kills Emily lol."

westworld,fq37mqy,t1_fq362ck,1589063767.0,"Yeah I have been rewatching that bar scene a lot. Ford has so many great scenes and pieces of dialogue in the 1st two seasons, him and bernard and the MIB have some great moments.

I think that is another thing that was missing, some truly great moments from the MIB. He had like the one solo episode and that after credit scene was wicked, but other than that not to much.
That scene in season 2 when he saves Lawrence's family was just beautiful, great writing and cinematography. Season 3 was missing moments like that with him"
westworld,fq35qst,t1_fq31j5f,1589063267.0,"Oh man I loved season 2, but I do see your point. I also thought we were going to dive right into the war, didn't expect this other set up.
But there seems to be a lot more twists and turns coming.
It did seem to try to be more ""mainstream"" this season, more geared to general audiences. But a part of me thinks it feels that way because we didn't have Ford to wax philosophical lol.
Anthony Hopkins really was a fucking gem in that show,  I knew it needs to move on but i miss his presence."

I mean I really enjoyed it but it didn't have the same impact of the first 2. I think it was just the necessary set up to brace the viewer for the changes coming in the later seasons. While the themes were the same season 3 felt like a very different show compared to 1 & 2 (not a bad thing)
Not the most exciting part of the story but a necessary bridge to connect the story. I for one am excited to see where the story takes us."
unpopularopinion,fq2t2y7,t3_ggj5k7,1589059382.0,"Bingo! Or even if they do it won't be for to long. You're allowed to be sad, just not to sad, eventually always comes down to ""be a man."" (Something my ex said to me after I had an emotional breakdown because of her cheating)
As a man you're always expected to just get over it, move on more quickly than humanly possible.
People make fun of the depressed, sad man.

But using my ex as an example no one makes fun of the sad, depressed woman. Especially if they are even moderately good looking.
Not a day goes by where she doesn't make a woe is me post, how sad and depressed she is. Publicizes every breakdown and hospitalization she had ever had. No one ever questions her behavior, if she is contributing to this pattern. No one changes their opinion, thinks any less or finds it embarrassing for her. Always nothing but sympathy and support. 

It is what it is but that is the reality of the world we live in. People blame men for this but that isn't entirely true, woman can be just as guilty for showing a lack of empathy to a man's emotional pain."
BPD,fq1opof,t1_fq1he25,1589047574.0,"Wow thank you very much for the response. I'll be honest early on I fell into the habit of blaming her BPD. Part of it was because she used her depression and BPD as excuses for her behaviour. But I think.the main reason is as always I was looking for excuses. Reasons not to blame her for her choices, some other I could blame for the way she treated me. But it wasn't fair and not entirely true.

If I may give some brief back story.
The first time she left she ghosted me 2 weeks before telling me she was done. Last message she sent me before NC was ""I can't breathe "" which terrified me.
She had asked me to watch her cat because she was feeling depressed and needed to get away. No problem  however I learned she was really cultivating a relationship with the guy she left me for.
I spiralled hard. Her radio silence and refusal for closure made me spiral worse. I sent way to many messages trying to find out if she was ok, what happened, why she cheated etc.
Was excessive, I was a basket case. So she called the cops and they told me to stay away, which I did. Never blamed her for it, honestly  I was greatful because I was extremely depressed and suicidal. Was the wake up call to get me into therapy, to start moving on.

And I did start moving on, was getting healthier, feeling better, better choices. But once she noticed that she started creeping me. Turns out the new guy dumped her, she ended up in the psyche ward because of a break down.
Then she emailed me, apologized for everything that happened, for discarding me, for calling the cops (which again I told her not to feel bad about, because she shouldn't)
Told me she had changed and wanted to work it out, that I was the live of her life etc.

I love her so I did. Took only a month and I found out she was sexting and sending nudes to other guys. It ended, she had a new bf within 2 days, posting on FB how she loves him.
She went back to no contact. Back to calling me an abuser on FB, making jokes at my expense again with her new one. I'll admit I lashed out at times, one thing I never did was laugh or joke about her emotional pain, or any pain. Something she consistently did to me. Essentially took back everything in her letter, playing out exactly as it did the first time I spoke about.

The worst is I still care. I don't know if she is truly happy this time or just repeating the same toxic behaviors. Behavior she herself said was toxic and wanted to change.
I just don't get why she came back, part of me thinks to.try and heal herself with no regard to how it made me feel.

I just get worried I'm focusing to much on the BPD part, blaming her illness for her behaviour when I shouldn't be. Not wanting to believe that maybe she is just a natural cruel and selfish person.

I know you can't really answer any of this for me, I do appreciate your words very much.  It's just been a really strange experience I've struggled to understand. I've spent tha past year researching depression, BPD, anything to try and understand how she felt, what she goes through. But I think it has just made me put more blame on her illness than on her.

*to add when she left the first time.she said it was because she dissociated for months. That she had a habit of ""dick hopping"" to avoid dealing with feelings of failure and abandonment. That therapy made her realize she loved me. Which kind of hurt because I didn't need someone to tell.me how I felt about her."
BPDlovedones,fq1kluz,t1_fq1e7lo,1589046489.0,"Lol no problem brother.
Oh man I wanted mine back, even went back. Was a disaster, repeat of the same lies and cheating. But maybe that's what I needed for it to sink in that she is terrible. No one wants to believe someone they loved is malicious and cruel, but shit it happens lol.

I let it fuck me up last time, almost fell into the same pattern. I messaged her a bit trying to get her to be honest.
But I've realized I will never get a real apology,  a real acknowledgment. She can't because that would mean acknowledging the shitty things shes done, which she can't do.

Take solace in knowing you will come out of this better and they likely will not. Sometimes people do get what they deserve."
BPDlovedones,fq1dr5v,t1_fq15mw3,1589044735.0,"Dude mine qs with someone else before she left. A week after discard posting on FB about him, how shes in love. How I'm a piece if shit and abused her. Girl called the cops on me because I messaged her to much trying to find out what happened,  which I stopped. Was told to never contact again so I didn't.

6 months later and she was emailing me begging for forgiveness.
So be prepared for anything. Their emotions don't last, the guilt and shame for how they act always bubbles up. Always. 
If this new one dumps her, or once the honeymoon period is over she may come back."
BPD,fq13x8n,t1_fq12wss,1589041408.0,"Lol my ex bought all the same things, and make up."
BPD,fq13npq,t3_ggdrki,1589041296.0,"My ex cheated then disappeared on me last year. 6 months, never heard form her.she came back eventually to apologize and tell me she loved me. Told me she had BPD but was working on it in therapy, and that she wanted to work things out.
I loved her so I was in, a month later she just cheated on me again, had a complete breakdown and ghosted me again. New BF within 2 days.

My point it I think the healing process and therapy is something those who suffer  need to focus on first or else they will repeat the same patterns.
My ex thought she was ready, but clearly she was not. I had hoped she would spend time focusing on herself, but she has crippling loneliness so she needs a new guy.
It's a vicious cycle because she knows she's unhealthy and wants to get better, but she doesn't want to be alone. But being alone is he only time she puts the focus on her healing, when in a relationship she goes all in on them.
It hurts how she treated me, but I do feel bad for her existence because I know she is miserable with her behaviours.

Edit:poor wording"
BPD,fq11wl4,t3_ggeroa,1589040659.0,"My ex had bpd and she at times showed a lot of empathy. While other times she was the coldest, most uncaring person I had ever met. Was like a totally different person, the lengths she would go to hurt people, hurt me, were down right scary."

BPDlovedones,fpxw9c9,t1_fpxtl5j,1588990860.0,"The sad part is I was happy she came back. I had read all about the hoovering and messages but mine had been total silence. No closure, didn't seem to care or miss me. I had messaged her for closure but was always radio silence.
So when she came back I was happy, I ignored the reality of what happened and was just consumed by my emotions. Reality set in eventually though lol.

Now that she has done the hoover and return and broke my heart again I'm worried she will try again. She really set back my progress, but it is my own dumbass fault lol.
Yeah I can't move right now, she only lives a few blocks away but I haven't run into her thankfully.
I think I'm strong enough this time to handle it but I just want her out of my life for good. 

It will happen man. When mine first left I was broken, just a complete wreck and shell. Got so desperate I started doing therapy which helped. Was making real progress until she came back which was a bit of a bump, but I will get back on the road. Point is I was a disaster but I climbed out, while not perfect I have come a long way and will keep going. And if I can do it I know you and anyone else can do it too. One of the hardest things I've experienced but we will get there, be fully healed and the people we once were. We just have to remember who we were before we met them."

A bunch of people from out of town potentially taking up food and medical resources in very small towns that would not be equipped if infections started to blow up again.

Also potentially bringing the illness into smaller communities and doing damage when they may have had it under control beforehand.

I'm not saying that at all, I'm saying that the majority wouldn't do a thing even if it looked like.it was getting to that point.

Let's take America as an example. Very big on guns so they can fight back against an oppressive government.
The American government has been stealing citizens freedoms for years, the patriot act is one that comes to mind but that's not all.
The current President is more openly corrupt than any I have seen, literally fleecing America out of trillions of dollars for him and his cronies. Letting thousands and potentially millions of Americand die and hasn't shown a shred of remorse, is gleeful if they are a blue state. Stealing medical supplies during a pandemic leaving countless states and people struggling. Offering no relief to the average citizen but letting corporations make profit off taxpayer money. Insighting violence, encouraging terroristic asshats to.storm government buildings with weapons. I could go on, and what have people done in all these years as the government slowly takes their freedoms? Absolutely nothing. Most openly corrupt president who is likely to destroy America, at the very least has knocked it off as the leader of the world. What have people done? Absolutely nothing.
Kids in cages? Absolutely nothing.

If it got to the point where dissenters are getting murdered in the street (happened at Kent state already by the way) then  it would already be to late to do anything.
And no I don't think we would be any different than the Americans, there is no reason to believe we would be different.

I think the worst thing they did was push university on kids and act like college was for the ""less smart"" kids, that's how it was when I was younger. They acted like trades shouldn't be your first choice, it's nice to see that has been changing a bit.

The way you described it in the first paragraph is exactly how it should be done. There is far more value in being a skilled tradesmen in society, these are people we will always need whose skills bring real value to society.
