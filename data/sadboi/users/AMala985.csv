Being warm and friendly not only goes a long way in repairing a relationship it also helps build friendships. If you’re really going to raise a child together then you need to at least be friends. If he doesn’t want to be together accept his no, express your feelings and leave it alone. Seriously leave it alone. If he wants to seek something further with you he will. In the mean time focus on taking care of yourself and having a great pregnancy."

FemaleDatingStrategy,fbcl5dv,t3_eck4fk,1576726559.0,Can we add this post all over the internet? Men really need to know this. Idk why they don’t but they should. Idc how well endowed you are. Last thing I’m trying to experience is 15min of heavy petting then 5 mins of being pounded and that’s it. I totally agree with so many of the comments. I’d much rather be with a man of average or smaller size who is willing to commit the time and energy into exploring my wants and needs. Literally nothing is better than someone who is attentive to your pleasure.

datingoverthirty,fb66xt5,t3_ebl1sh,1576542907.0,No you’re not crazy. I just ignore the ones who couldn’t take 5 min of their life to make some sort of effort.

Dating someone isn’t going to fix you and your self esteem. Find what makes YOU happy and then allow someone else into that world. Other people, especially women are going to see your insecurities and find it unattractive. It’s ok to vulnerable but it’s not ok to dislike yourself so strongly. Love you and love will follow."

BipolarSOs,f4j72r4,t1_f4j69ze,1571614117.0,I think that’s why I have had such a hard time letting go. He’s never intentionally done anything to hurt me. He’s always been supportive of me and even though his actions right now aren’t the way I would handle it I trust that he’ll figure it out. He’s never once called me ugly names or belittled me in anyway so I really have to give him credit because I’m sure it’s very easy for someone who is fighting internally to project outwards. I really hope things get better for you. You deserve happiness!!
me_irl,f490en6,t3_djlxfd,1571453909.0,I laughed way too hard at this
BipolarSOs,f452wb7,t3_djef7v,1571364745.0,This is something I’ve dealt with as well. I stopped opening up to people and coming here to talk about it and ven instead. My SO has done some shitty stuff but he’s also done some amazing things that have been some of the best parts of my life. I feel like i am the only one who can empathize or even begin to try to understand what he’s going through and that he’s not the “bad guy”. He still doesn’t want to be with me so I’m working on making peace with that. Idk if he’ll change his mind or what will happen in the future but I get what you’re saying on so many levels. I wish I was capable of finding a cure for mental illness. I wish I could take all of this away from him and everyone else who has to deal with this both the person with the illness and the ones that love them.
BipolarSOs,f3xq6c1,t3_dikjw8,1571242210.0,I feel this on so many different levels. I wish I had advice for you.

I feel so unworthy. I’ll if that make sense."

I took the “in sickness and in health” vow to heart. My husband has left me several times. Once while I was pregnant and he missed the birth of our child. He’s said and done some truly awful things to me. This relationship may not work out and they may not be the one for you, but please use it as motivation to care for yourself no matter how difficult medications and therapy may get. Never give up on yourself. Love yourself. There is no such thing as “normal”. You’re wonderful the way you are, just focus on being the best version of yourself. So when someone like me comes along and loves you unconditionally, you’ll be ready and you’ll be able to have a healthy fulfilling and amazing relationship."

BipolarSOs,f26pfxf,t1_f26lr3x,1570019580.0,I truly get that it’s a mental illness and it’s something that at times they have a hard time controlling but the thing is they have control over whether or not they get therapy and meds. It’s the choosing not to and then taking me on a damn rollercoaster that I’m not ok with. I know deep in my heart I’m worth so much more than this but at this point I’m so freaking broken I’m just a shell of who I used to be. I don’t even feel like a person anymore.

I’ve learned the hard way that all of these things are “normal” when someone is unmedicated and unwilling to recognize and act on the signs of a manic episode. What you’re experiencing with your SO is not uncommon and actually mentioned quite frequently here. I myself have dealt with it. TBH I’m at the point of walking away. I believe in for better or worse and in sickness and in health but like someone else mentioned here earlier only if health is the goal. There are people who have successful relationships but they take even more hard work and will come with some insane ups and downs. It really all depends on his desire to get help, stay healthy and take care of himself. My husband has done things when manic that even years later he doesn’t recall how the exact events unfolded. The needing space is pretty common too. You’re gonna need to make some solid boundaries and stick to them for your own sanity. Always here if you need someone to talk to."
