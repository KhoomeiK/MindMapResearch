Initially I thought I could sit my exam here and apply for a compact license, but from my research that is not possible, because you have to live in a compact state to get a compact license. If I moved to CO I could get the license there, but I need to establish proof of primary residence, which takes a while. So my question is, which is easier: taking NCLEX here and applying for a CO license through endorsement, or taking the NCLEX in Colorado after I establish proof of residency (which may take longer, since I am not moving until July). Hopefully that makes sense."
