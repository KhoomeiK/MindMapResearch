depression,f4ugima,t1_f4ugfy0,1571809673.0,"that’s a great start. literally just the small things that make you happy. you’ll come to enjoy the more persistent issues you have with the way you look or the things that suck in life. some days, only my cat made me happy. but that’s enough to keep going to the next day."
depression,f4ugd4i,t1_f4ug3th,1571809498.0,"i think it’s more about coming to terms with what you’ve been given. my nose is stupid small and i’ve got more freckles than you can count. those are things i can’t change. but it could be worse i suppose (which i hear all the time and i know it’s annoying to say). 

one thing that helped me come to terms with how i look was writing every single day a list of things i’m grateful for. i would make a list of daily things, like being grateful for my gel pens or how my hair isn’t falling out, and a list of big things like how my family still cares for me. 

it was hard at first to think of even one thing i liked about myself, but just starting small like how i like my handwriting or how my eyebrows look, i was able to appreciate more. i did it for months and the small things really began to add up. it probably doesn’t work for everyone but it really helped to get me out of my self hatred funk."
depression,f4ug3oz,t3_dltwe6,1571809204.0,"i had the exact same experience. i used to draw all the time until one day, i just didn’t find any joy in it. i began to cut myself as well as a different coping method. and logically we all know it’s bad but the urge still remains. 

what i found to help is drawing on my arm instead, with a sharpie. i would draw elaborate pictures on top of scars and that helped me stop. if i wanted to show anyone what i had drawn, i couldn’t cut. and it would all fade away within a few days. it’s like venting without any consequence. or like getting a tattoo without the commitment. 

good luck, and don’t give up ❤️"

you have every right to be terrified due to your past experiences. it’s normal. just don’t let it get to your head too much. you’ve probably heard it all before but it’ll be okay. let her know that it’ll be okay. as long as you have each other, you’ll both be fine. good luck ❤️"

depression,f4ueplh,t1_f4u9blw,1571807707.0,"you’re put into a facility for the mentally unstable. personally, i compare it to an insane asylum. it’s based on age, so teens go to teen hospitals, while adults have their own. 

once hospitalized, you are required to stay for at least 72 hours, no exceptions. you are given a room, often with a roommate but not always (and some of the high risk patients are put alone). you are monitored 24/7 and nurses are always on the clock, with 10-15 minute checkups all day and all night. the idea is to provide a place where you cannot hurt yourself until you are out of the “state of emergency”. you will be required to attend the group therapy sessions and must show steps to wanting to improve if you want to leave. it’s very easy to fake though, and it is unbelievably common for one hospitalization to lead to another in just a month."

however, for me it’s never been forgetting appointments or that i made plans with someone. it’s always just things that happened in the past."
