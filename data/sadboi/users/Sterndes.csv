You get to the point where you decide to live or die.  I have decided to live, the depression will always be a part of me, but I will fight!  No matter how hard it is, I won't give up

In my opinion, life isn't beautiful  Sure, there are nice moments in life, but most of the time, we complain.  We all want prosperity, a family, no illness and a peaceful death. 
 
But life is not like that, not even knowledge helps you.  You just have to accept that we will all die sometime.  So why would you be so quick to take the shortcut?  Please don't do it and keep fighting.."

to point 2: it is clearly stated in my doctor's letter that I had a previous narcolepsy. 

Unfortunately I have been to many doctors and have spent several nights in a sleep laboratory in several years. It is not my only report. I have been in a sleep lab about 20 times since 2012 (when narcolepsy was diagnosed), each time narcolepsy was diagnosed. So I can rule out an incorrect test measurement.

I have been diagnosed with narcolepsy by various institutions and doctors. 

I also have a report from 2019, which I would have to find out.Besides, this year, like you, I will test myself again if there is still any sleep disorder.  When I have the report, I can tell you more."

I don't want to start any trouble here. I thought it wasn't allowed in Reddit's rules.

Narcolepsy,fnzfd6t,t1_fnzbrhq,1587392975.0,"In my doctor's report, however, it says that there are no longer any symptoms to indicate narcolepsy. And I was previously diagnosed with narcolepsy type 2. Sorry, but I'm not imagining things. It was the worst time of my life. Clearly the parameters of the symptoms have changed and now I may have an attenuated form of insomnia. Unfortunately the symptoms of many sleep disorders are very similar, so it is especially difficult to get a concrete diagnosis. In the beginning it was idiopathic hypersomnia, then chronic fatigue syndrome and in the end it was agreed that it was type 2 narcolepsy without cataplexy.  But in general I can say that I have no symptoms that promote narcolepsy. I have been able to free my father from it and he no longer has to constantly get struggle going out of the bed. And I have not had them for several years now.

I don't want to attack you here, but if you block this in advance, I cannot share my experience. So please leave room for people who have had other experiences.
