AskAstrologers,fn0lyj3,t3_fye89n,1586544387.0,"My boyfriend has his Mercury retrograde (in Taurus), and his sun is Gemini. I'm mentioning his Sun because the way that Taurus and Gemini thinks is very opposite to begin with, and he manages to somehow combine the traits of both (his moon, his emotions and heart, is also Taurus). The retrograde Mercury (thought, mind, communication), makes him more quiet and introverted than most Geminis you may meet. He is not loud or the center of attention, although he is very intelligent and quickwitted and carry on a great conversation (oh gods the freaking puns), but especially when its an emotional subject, he processes it slowly (my fire stellium does not like this lol). I hope this helped!"

Christianity,fmq62sr,t3_fw480v,1586293547.0,"Hello, I just want to say that I am a fellow pagan who doesn't have a problem with Jesus. He's not my God, but I respect Him quite a bit. However, it took a LOT of self work to get there. Many pagans who have that ""Christian hate"" mentality have been deeply, deeply wounded by abuse that may or may not have been religiously motivated- it could have just been an abusive person who used religion as a cover or sheild.

My father was an oppertunist narcissist who used whatever power structures he could, and that was often religion (friend of friend of friend told me he was impersonating a Buddhist priest a few years ago, so he's since moved on from Christianity), and my mother was a true believer, but not ... mentally well. Especially married to a man like my father. This makes for a toxic environment. Now, most pagans are still converts, yes we have 3rd and 4th generation pagans now, but most of us grew up in some other religion. So that means we have that religious fervor of a convert. There aren't many ""sunday pagans"" who do it culturally, or at least there didn't used to be, now it seems like there are a lot more atheist pagans which I'm not very happy about at all (whole different subject lol)

I don't have any advice for you about your relationship with Jesus, because as I said, he's not my God. But I wanted to try to explain the dynamic I see going on with other pagans, especially young ones who may be new to the path. I hope that in time we can stop defining ourselves by what we are NOT and start definining ourselves by what we ARE, but it's a long road ahead of us, admittedly, and people have to be willing to work on themselves and pull apart their psyches. That's never fun.  Many people simply just don't want to do it. 

I try to talk about this to others when the subject comes up, because I want them to selfreflect a bit, yknow? There's always gonna be jerks in EVERY community who don't wanna work on themselves and want to blame someone else.
Good luck to you. (Edit: if you're wondering how I found this, I was searching for info on pagans in interfaith relationships and your post came up somehow. Lol)"
religion,fmq40gd,t1_fm9t0j0,1586292462.0,"I had the same experience. My ex was a hardcore atheist, the very mean and disrespectful kind. Actually called me stupid for having beliefs. And yet, lied to his parents and let them believe he was still Christian, which of course made me the bad guy. I have so much baggage from him that I am still working thru. I will never date a hardcore atheist again. I have more in common with a Christian who agrees there is something out there, at least. My current SO is agnostic, and imo there is a big difference between saying ""I don't know bc I've never had a spiritual experience"", and ""I know for sure there is no God/s and you're stupid to have beliefs and practices"". Overall my bf has been very respectful and curious and openminded, but .... we don't speak the same language, and I'm not laity. Everything I do connects back to being Pagan, and I feel called to study Norse Shamanism ... my ex called me crazy and thought that journeying was just in my mind. I find it very hard to talk about my deeper spiritual practices with my boyfriend because I'm so afraid of being rejected or called crazy again. I wonder about our longterm possibilities. But I'm also very in my head right now with the quarantine. I don't know. It sucks."

I look around my circle at my friends, and only one pagan/nonpagan relationship has worked out longterm, and it was rocky. I don't know if that's a statement about relationships in general, tho. I have to admit that I have doubts but I try not to let them get the best of me."

My mother used to send me birthday cards, and it made me dread my birthday. I now live somewhere that neither of my parents have ever seen, or heard of, and it feels so energetically clean. I've even legally changed my last name to one ***I*** picked, to craft my own identity and not be beholden to them or carry a family legacy that I consider to be spiritually polluted. I didn't want to have to think of them every time I signed my name. Now I don't. 

Good luck moving forward, you are already doing fantastic!!!"
ABoringDystopia,fmidret,t1_fmicmu6,1586107565.0,"I completely agree. But it's harder in real life, when it will make your boss think differently of you and change your chances of getting a raise, transfer, promotion, whatever. Reddit is anonymous. I try to be open when and where I feel I can. But it's also a matter of trauma - I don't want to give literally everyone the means to push my buttons, as it wasn't an easy time and I am NOT okay. I appreciate you listening."
