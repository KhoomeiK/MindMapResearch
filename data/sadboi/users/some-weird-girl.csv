I had just moved in with my bf and then hit rock bottom, so it was really hard to go through all of this in a brand new relationship. When I started playing though it gave me something to work on again and to live for. As he wakes up each morning to start working at our kitchen table, I now sit across from him with my cup of coffee and start my dailies. In less than a month with my account I've accomplished multiple goals, earned over $1 million and my mental health has improved *substantially*. I am so thankful for the community, and my silly little Neopets! I can't say I absolutely understand what it does for you but it sounds very similar to me, so just know that you are not alone and this community is an amazing help to many!

advertising,fbcn0pr,t3_ecl5b7,1576727920.0,"I’m 26, advertising degree and went safe corporate marketing route instead of agency. Regret it every day. Currently trying like hell to get into an agency and having 4 years of irrelevant “marketing” experience that’s really just bs sales work specific to each company I was at is only hindering me. Every interview I get hit with why tf are you just now aiming for an agency, where have you been? And it fucking sucks. I got the perks of the higher salary and pumped that up too so now I’m looking at a decrease of at least $20k in salary to get into the agency side of things. Trust me, go B right now while you’re young and you have the ability to get into the competitive side of the industry with no questions asked. If you don’t like it, there will always be a ton of side A options out there and they won’t give a fuck what you’ve been doing, they aren’t picky like agencies are. I saw a comment about how you’ve gotta read the people and that’s true regardless. Either side can be toxic, and I can only speak from one but let me tell you my side A has never been anything but toxic all 4 years."
advertising,fbbuade,t1_fbbjrmi,1576708290.0,"This is all great, thank you very much for the advice! 

I will definitely keep in mind all that you said about agency life and work. What you said about agencies being on the tech/data side of things is helpful bc I feel like I am struggling with how to approach them and tell them what they want to hear in interviews or online surveys. It is different than traditional corporate work, so I guess after 4 years of nothing else I feel a little unsure of how to make myself appealing to an agency. I can tell you’ve got a lot of good, well-rounded experience though so you’ve given me some good info to chew on and hopefully help me get into the agency mindset and find what will make them tick."
advertising,fb8kszb,t1_fb8ihl6,1576616066.0,"Interesting perspective. It will definitely be a huge step down in salary from where I’m at now. But I just can’t stand the boxed up corporate life anymore. I don’t fit in, and at my current job that I got almost a year ago my boss very quickly decided she doesn’t like me as a person. which is fine except she can’t get past it and it affects our relationship daily. I am her only employee. I know she wants me gone, and I’m just ready to flip the switch and work somewhere cool where everyone has a work hard play hard attitude and is closer to my age. Typical young person skewed priorities, I know, I’ve heard it. The more modern laid back companies are where it’s at though, and these sleeping corporate giants are realizing it finally, but slow to the draw. Plus I like the sound of a media buyer/planner role. It’s what my bf does now and I’d like that kind of work. Sure beats basically doing legal administrative work for marketing literature and pretending it’s a real marketing job like all these companies in bham lure you to do. I’m basically a fancy administrative assistant for marketing/sales.

What do you do currently though to make you say that? Sounds like maybe you were in the industry at one point and got out?"

Because I am a young creative trying to break into the agency world and I have been emailing agencies like crazy this week! I’ve had a few respond too and give me good advice which has been really motivating. I know I’m young and green and just white noise in their hectic lives so any response I get makes me so happy that they took the time to reply. I’ve even made connections from it and had a few high ups schedule calls with me to help me out in ways to distinguish myself. It’s been a huge learning curve honestly, I graduated with an advertising degree 4 years ago but I never truly did anything with it yet, just marketing jobs. I’ve finally decided it’s time to get off my ass and quit being afraid to go after what I want. There’s not a lot of options here and it’s already a tough industry to begin with, but I know if I keep trying it’s a matter of when not if. But yeah, my best advice is to send those emails to every agency bc you never know what you’ll get. And like you said, be honest. Don’t try to kiss ass too much. I just send an email with a few straightforward sentences that I have been working 4 years and I have marketing experience but I’m ready to break into the advertising agency world. I do need to get my portfolio together though, I have campaigns I created in college but I’m ashamed to say I don’t even know where that folder is right now.

We were supposed to learn everything in a huge booklet about safety and motorcycle mechanics, and instead the instructor went back and forth from acting like me joe cool who thinks all of it is a joke to being very extreme and telling us if we weren’t perfect we’d die. It definitely wound up feeling like a scam to pedal their brand, we spent half a day looking at bikes, every piece of clothing ever (including the baby section and child bikes when none of us had kids and they knew it), and then a mechanic pumped his own tires for an hour giving us a tour of the back and how great they do if you bring your bike in monthly.

I’d never failed that badly before so it’s been a slap in the face for sure. It shook me for real and I’ve just been panicking that maybe I can’t do it, I mean sometimes people just literally can’t do things no matter how hard they try.

That’s not even a reason why I can’t do it, just a hardass attitude comment. My dad is in his mid 50s and has been riding since he was 14. He’s had gnarly wrecks and witnessed all kinds of horrible things through the biker community here and online forums. But he doesn’t have your attitude. It’s just not helpful you know? I asked whether or not I could do it. And I respect you saying I can’t. I just wanted insight so I can understand before I give up, and a lousy hardass intimidation response isn’t a real answer.

But the ratio of difficulty is the same. Riding is riding, you think we can’t have the same passion and work hard attitude about things? It’s not an issue of a safe space, women are built differently our center of gravity is in our hips where yours is in your shoulders, so things are going to feel and be different for us.

That’s basically what I’m trying to figure out, is what type of thoughts mean riding isn’t going to be an ideal hobby bc since that course traumatized me unfortunately it took a lot of my excitement away and made me terrified of not having control of my surroundings. The instructor was pretty bad, he yelled at us a lot about terrifying things that could happen and just threw all kinds of things at us very intensely. He’d been in the military so his approach was very dominating and cold like that. He even started bullying me specifically saying “I’m one of those types who just never fails at anything I do”. It was pretty fucked up imo. I’ve told several people in my area about my experience and all of them have been shocked and told me the places they took their courses were totally different and on smaller bikes too. I just can’t shake it for some reason. My dad has offered to teach me in a nearby parking lot and he can ride my bike up there. He actually agreed the class was a money making pile of bullshit and is going to let me go at my own pace, but he can still be impatient with me at times too. I got a bunch of super padded riding gear to boost my confidence and it helped a little too.

Did some research on it and like other comments mention, they’re a fairly new and very invasive species that recently got introduced to the US. I believe they came from Japan, and the problem is bc they’re gross and stinky only one species of frog eats them and literally nothing else does...and that frog is in Japan. Not here at all. So we need to introduce it to the US too now bc I’m going crazy!! They’ve already started creeping back into my bedroom this year..."

So now I’m just creepily watching people sleep.."
