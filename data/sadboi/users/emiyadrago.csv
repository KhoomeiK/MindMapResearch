Not so much now as in the past, like 4 years ago. I would always flaunt my alleged intelligence before others as a way to compensate my low self-esteem, and as a result I would appear even less clever than I actually was.


Now, instead, I notice that most of the time I fail to grasp new concepts or even just to comprehend simple sentences from my peers. How do I know? Because when I try to tell them back what they just said, by rephrasing it, they often tell me ""no no, you got it the other way around""
