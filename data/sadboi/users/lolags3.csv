I have a few experiences.
When I was a little kid, I would wake up at 1 in the morning and clean the whole house to please my mother. I would wait until bedtime and drink a giant glass of coffee and then go to bed, wake right up, jump out of bed, and very quietly, very sneaky, clean everything. Looking back, my mom didn't appreciate it as much as she should have. Haha LOL.
So I would work in total darkness, so that I wouldn't wake anybody up. After I had done this three or four times, I was in the kitchen looking into the dark backyard. And they're standing on the fence watching me, was the figure of a man. It was all black. and the fence could not support the weight of a man like that. It was a rickety wooden fence 6 ft tall made with cedar slats. I was so terrified I dropped to the floor and hid. After several minutes of telling myself it must have been the tree branches from the elm tree, but also knowing that the tree branches did not look like that at all, I slowly  looked again. It was still there. I dropped down again, and crawled to another window, peeked out again.  I was terrified that it was watching me. I didn't understand how a man could do that. After seeing it a few times and just hiding in fear on the floor, it was gone. 
I stopped cleaning the house in the middle of the night. 
I didn't see things like that again until I was an adult and we built a home in the Arizona desert on land that had cowboy history and native people history going way back. Previously, I had lived in a mobile home where I felt the presence of a woman who had died there. She was more of a motherly feeling and it wasn't bad, but building our own home, I thought would be free of spirits, I looked forward to that. But we were so mistaken. 
One of the upstairs deck doors would open and slam on its own. It got to be that we just laughed about it. We would lock the door and everyone would be downstairs and we hear the door open and slam. We'd go up and check the lock and it would be locked. That happened so much we joked about it.
My husband who was a skeptic, came in and woke me up because he kept hearing a music box play. Electricity had gone off in the whole area, it was a total blackout. Our teenage kids all hopped in the car to go into town. I went to bed. My husband heard Cowboys talking and then the music box. And he heard it repeatedly on that night when there was no tv anywhere because of no electricity. He called them Cowboys because they had some kind of a western accent. He came in and woke me up twice thinking I was playing a prank on him.

I spoke with my daughter's boss who was descended from a line of native shaman for one of the native nation's in Arizona. She said she saw spirits all the time in the workplace, and that sometimes they followed people home. 
that night I was in the TV room and I looked into the kitchen and I saw this black vapor swirling and moving. Another one appeared. It had a strange face on it. It reminded me of the Japanese Spirit faces but also there are some designs on native jewelry that have like a line through the middle of the face, it was black and white. It looked at me. I just watched it. I didn't know what to think. I was slightly scared/ concerned, but not terrified. I hadn't been dr*nking I didn't use dr*gs. And after less than 2 minutes they disappeared. I never saw them in the house again."

When I was 12 or 13, a friend and I started to mess around with Ouija boards and putting pins and candles and making up incantations. We wanted it to be true and we wanted to see something. We were both pretty innocent. We were not on drugs. One night after my parents fell asleep I went over to her house. We told ghost stories. She acted like she was possessed by something, and said she could see a shadow of a ghost on the wall. If I tried really hard, I could sort of imagine maybe there was a dark spot. But I could have been making it up in my mind just as easily. I thought she was faking it. We went back to my house, two doors down.
We messed around with some candles and tried to make witchy incantations. She acted like she was in a trance again, and I thought she was being fake.
We were sitting in my front yard in the dark, in the summer in Arizona at about 3 in the morning. It's warm but not miserable in Summer nights. I looked towards the street light which was at the edge of our property, and there, between the street light and the back of my parents car, I saw this entity in a black shroud. It was moving down, it had black hair and a strong widow's peak, but it had no eyes. Since it was moving, what I noticed was it was blocking the street light behind it and I could see through the windows of the car that it was actually there. I was just a little kid, I was instantly terrified. I said, Cheryl do you see that! She looked and she didn't see anything. I looked back at the car, I could still see the thing behind the car in front of the Street lamp Post. I started crying and wanted to leave. Cheryl McDaniel still couldn't see it. (Maybe I'll find my old friend) She threatened to slap me if I didn't come to my senses, and when I looked again it was gone. I was done for the night and I went in. I also didn't like her threatening to slap me. We never did anything like that again."
TrueOffMyChest,fby43ks,t3_ef2h6z,1577207610.0,"Hey, hi there!
One thing I have learned in my lifetime, is that what you had as a child takes a turn, and a different step as an adult. 
It's not bad it's different. And while you miss what you had, the fond memories, the love, what you have is also good.
Perhaps there is a cultural celebration that you can turn into a family event. You could say it is MANDATORY with a big smile on your face. Make it pot luck, so you don't go broke. Have a puzzle table, games for children, and even games and activities for adults. 
Start your own tradition. Your children and wife will love it. Your extended family will also love it. 
The life I had with my husband was different than the life I had with my father and mother.
We had five kids together. We still get together and play games and have our own funny little traditions that are different than either of our childhoods, but they all include fun and good food and lots of love.
Every culture in the world is made up of families who love each other. It's our world leaders who need to understand that.
(Referring to the person who said you should leave your country.)
Wherever you are, I hope you are happy and safe."

They were all laughing and giddy with lack of sleep. Who knew the airport was ever empty. I was holding on to my little ones and watching constantly. After he left, there one second and gone the next, didn't see him go-  he scream laughed maniacally through the airport. My family commented on it. It was crazy.

I had a thing happen to me, and I always wondered what terror I missed, similar in the fear factor of what you experienced. 
There was a rapist in a certain area. He was described as being handsome and well dressed.  Common sense told me to avoid the dark, and the area, which I did. But sometimes life just has a way of taking you where you didn't want to be. Running errands for someone else, I was in the area in a parking lot at closing time. Last one out of the store. People got in their cars and cleared in like 20 seconds. Everyone was on alert. I was moving slow but trying to hurry.  I saw a man near a store like 200 feet away. I quickly put some things in the back of the car, and looked again and he was gone. I went to get in the driver seat, and there he was. Right in front of me and the car. Like he must have ducked and run through the parking lot to get to me that fast. He was in a suit. He was clean cut.
He smiled real big and said, Hello there. He didn't act like a man hitting on a woman. He had a sick Glee in his face for the fear in mine.  And then he saw my 9 month pregnant belly. He said, shiiiit. And turned and walked away.  I always felt like I got away from something horrible there."

That's an interesting thought. Cave dwellers. 
Underground would have a more stable temperature year round. The Bigfoot look like hairy primates. Underground dwelling could be comfortable/livable. 
They are probably at least as intelligent as orangutans and other higher apes, which don't eat human children, but chimps have eaten other chimps babies, so not to rule out the possibility.
If there are cave systems, or nests, could it be possible to use sonar? Fishing sonar is quite impressive. You can see amazing things. Maybe that would work. 
Good luck to whomever uses sonar and finds a family or colony! Hope you have backup support!"
