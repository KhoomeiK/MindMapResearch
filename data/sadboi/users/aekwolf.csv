I do find myself wondering if I should ask him if he's ok for the 80th time that day or if my constant concern is in itself annoying. I don't know if I should try to keep from reacting to it as much. I know sometimes I get frustrated if someone keeps focusing on my own issues when I know there isn't anything that can be done about them. Is too much concern annoying?"

So he played me with his favorite character expecting to wipe the dust with me (especially as I hadn't played that version yet), but I beat him repeatedly. He got SUPER butthurt about it. 

Same guy had asked me to join the academic team because they needed one more member to have the team compete.

I think he just couldn't fathom that a girl could beat him at the things he prided himself on. I don't know why, obviously I liked video games and cared about my studies.

He had the audacity to ask why I would ruin his life like that. He wanted to be a politician and so didn't want anything ""embarrassing"" on his record. I told him that if he was sincere about killing himself, he was throwing his own life away, calling the police would only be saving it.

DeadBedrooms,fox5bi0,t3_g9t1d5,1588134439.0,"For women, often sex and masturbation meet different needs depending on circumstances. Before my current relationship, I did not orgasm during PIV and my partners often weren't interested in making sure I was taken care of as long as they got to finish. My marriage turned into a dead bedroom due partially to depression/meds and partially because sex felt more like exploitation, it was all take and no give. He would try to shame me for masturbating, saying that if I wanted to have sex I should have told him, acting like I stole something from him. Truth was, I wanted release, not to have someone have sex with me before I was even ready, deal with the physical pain it caused, and then go to bed frustrated. 

My libido has extreme highs and lows. I initiate a lot during the highs, because sex is naturally on my mind. Not so during the lows. I'd still be receptive if I felt well enough. But sex for women is extremely mental. Reading romance stories, certain music, dancing, a lot of things can trigger sexual feelings. Feeling loved and taken care of can do it, giving a massage with nice smelling lotion (without ""expecting"" it to turn to sex, making things  feel transactional is a sure way to wither any sexual desire)."

AskReddit,foofbbg,t3_g88ccd,1587937928.0,"I used to work and live in a wildlife rehabilitation sanctuary. I was the only person to live at the facility, and this was on top of a mountain in a ski town with only about 300 residents.

Well, there was this douchebag who kept a dog chained up outside with no protection from the elements all day and night, and the dog was super skinny. My boss had complained to animal control about it and had confronted him and nothing had been done. So one night she steals the dog. I'm not going to debate whether this was the right thing to do or not.

Thing is, we figured this guy would most likely suspect us due to the noise my boss had made about the dog already. He was this scary, trashy guy, with a barbed wire tattoo around his neck. And while he didn't know where my boss lived, it would be easy to find the sanctuary she founded, where I lived alone.

I was reasonably worried about this, and in response my boss hung a gun on a nail next to my bed. Now, I have never shot not handled a gun, and honestly thinking about having to try to use that thing for protection was just as unnerving as having this scary dude show up at night.

I was in bed for the night, trying to sleep, and I start hearing strange noises. I was pretty young, only 19, and already pretty freaked out. So I just froze in the bed, listening. And suddenly my bedroom door opened. It was dark, so I couldn't see anything, and so I kept still in the bed trying to figure out what to do. The strange sound continued, and then something was ON MY BED.

I yelled out, grabbed my phone(not that I had any service), but by the light of my phone I saw who it was. Barnaby, a baby groundhog I was raising. I guess he got lonely and chewed out of his enclosure in the front room and came to find me. The weird sound was just this little deep chittering that groundhogs make, and I probably would have recognized it if it weren't for the fact I was already freaked out."

When I was trying to talk to him and understand what was going on, he started getting belligerent and loud and woke our toddler up. I was pissed that he had gotten shitfaced while alone with our son because you never know when an emergency can happen and he would have been unable to handle it and I was working an hour away. But, I was trying to focus on calming my son down and getting him back to sleep and getting some rest before going to my day job at 9. But when I went to go to my son's room, my ex blocked me in the hall and shoved me back, and then ran and held him over my head like some fucked up game of keep away.

When I finally got my son and calmed him down I tried calling my ex's family to go get him because I didn't want him around the toddler while he was drunk and belligerent. When they didn't answer I called my family and took my son over there and we spent the night so my ex could calm down. The whole time I was getting my son ready my ex was screaming abuse at me, even called my mother to cry to her. He even hit my son with the door when he slammed it open. I had started recording the audio of our interactions because he does a lot of gaslighting, and the sound of my son's cry as he is hit by the door still breaks my heart.

But, I was trying to be kind, and understanding. I knew he was not handling the fact that I was leaving very well. I should have called the police that night and I still kick myself for not having done so. 

My son stays with his paternal grandmother during the day while we worked and I took him there and my ex was already there with some of his stuff, apparently he had moved his stuff there in the night. I told him that I was going to try to just let us move forward and have a good co-parenting relationship and not harp at him for being shitty while upset. My sister in law heard me and pulled me aside and told me she hoped I still felt that way after I saw the apartment.

And it was so so trashed. It took the wind out of me to see it. Even my desk was in a million pieces. And my son couldn't live there anymore because of all the broken glass.

I noticed when I was in school that a lot of the students whose parents had paid for their tuition didn't take it seriously enough. When you paid for it yourself you are less likely to blow off your classes and waste it.

I understand your son's frustration, but neither he nor his siblings is entitled to have their college funded by you. I say NTA. You can't control that you are better off now than you were back then.

She is delivering three babies, and if she feels she would have to focus too much on managing her husband's emotions, then she has every right to go solo for the birth. 

I get that he is the dad and wants to be there for her and for them, and if this was a purely emotional thing I'd say he should totally be there, but this is a dangerous medical procedure and should be treated as such. If you had a partner that vomited at the sight of a tampon, would you have them go with you to have major nonbirth-related abdominal surgery?"

BipolarReddit,fntswz5,t3_g3nmy2,1587248022.0,"Honestly, I never hide that I have bipolar disorder from people I consider friends. If they have an issue with it then they aren't really my friends. And I'd rather answer their questions and have them understand why my personality may seem radically different at times than them being confused and frustrated with me at things I can't control. 

And I do get a bit offended when people say things like that, but I try and educate through humor and not make it seem like I am trying to pass a moral judgement on them for saying it."
relationship_advice,fnnvwg6,t1_fnnuqnb,1587103369.0,"Yeah, having hypersexuality coupled with poor impulse control is a difficult beast but it can be manageable. Relationships thrive with good communication and making sure everyone's needs are being met. When you have mental illness, sometimes you have to set up ways to cope with the symptoms in advance before they become a problem. It takes being proactive, and it isn't easy, but definitely doable. 

And having a supportive partner makes thing so much more manageable. Not everyone is cut out for loving someone with mental illness. It takes a lot of honesty and grace, as well as being able to understand that the difficulties your partner faces are not a reflection of you. Illness with sexual side effects is even harder with all the different stigmas and pride issues associated with it.

I'm glad your brother is doing better! Bipolar disorder is no joke and if you can find your way to stability that is a significant achievement."

relationship_advice,fnmuji2,t3_g2o74e,1587078429.0,"It sounds like she wants an open relationship, with boundaries being only female partners outside your relationship. If this is something you both feel comfortable with and agree to, it isn't cheating. Just like polyamory isn't cheating if all parties agree and everything is on the up and up. 

However, if you don't feel comfortable with your girlfriend having sex with other people, whatever the gender then tell her that. She'll either agree to keep sex between the two of you if that is something she feels comfortable with, or realize that the two of you aren't compatible. 

The ethics here are tied to consent and communication. If the two of you are both comfortable with the arrangement and consent to whatever boundaries you decide on, no cheating or unethical behavior is happening. It's only unethical if either she does this without your consent, behind your back, or you feel manipulated into agreeing to something that you aren't actually comfortable with. 

Think about what she is asking and identify what parts you do and don't have a problem with. If you were comfortable with her having sex outside your relationship, what boundaries would be necessary for you? Is she wanting purely sexual or romantic partners?  Once you have had some time to think about it, talk with your girlfriend so the two of you can decide what you are BOTH comfortable with. Communication is important.

Be careful to be honest with her, because you don't want to tell her you are ok with it, and then later accuse her of cheating when she was acting within the parameters you set out. You also want to make sure things are clear between you so she doesn't think you are ok with the arrangement if you are still in the talking it out/thinking phase. Try to approach this without judgement. Everyone is different, you don't want to throw words around with moral implications like cheating if what she is asking for is ethical nonmonogamy."
relationship_advice,fnmsj5i,t1_fnmqjtx,1587077328.0,"Ooof, what a loser. Just because someone is into having sex with you doesn't make them insatiable, and being insatiable doesn't mean they would cheat on you. Sounds like an excuse to sling his dick around.

I have Bipolar disorder, and one of the symptoms I get with that is hypersexuality. My boyfriend has never expressed any worry that I would cheat on him, he knows that sex between the two of us is special, and I'm not out looking for any dick I can get. Besides, vibrators are a thing, and before this relationship, usually my only go to for any satisfaction anyway. 

Reminds me of a guy from a weird movie I saw that was sexually attracted to mannequins. Like, why wouldn't you want your partner to be responsive?"

wholesomememes,fmr4sk8,t1_fmr3kfx,1586313877.0,"I believe that fonts like these are weighted differently to make them easier to differentiate, as well as having the extended parts of the letter longer. If you look, you'll see that the line weight at the top of the letters is noticeably different than that of the bottom.

In most typefaces, the letters are designed to look much more similar. Optical illusions are even used to make the letters look more visually balanced, such as letters like O and C being slightly taller since the brain tricks you into thinking that round shapes are smaller than square ones of the same height. 

I have used a similar font to make educational posters for schools, where it is important to make knowledge accessible to all. It's perfectly usable, just not what most people expect to see."

My dad is actually an IT professor, and his favorite answer is ""it depends"" which while mildly infuriating is often true. Are you looking for something that is going to eliminate code altogether? What programming are you learning?

I wasn't fond of the networking side of things, the stuff I enjoyed most was building and solving problems with code. The only coding they focused on in the IT side of the college was php, sql, and some limited html/css stuff. I did a lot of self-learning on html 5 and css3 but that's because I wanted to design both front and back ends of websites. 

If you wanted to eliminate code from your future, you could probably focus on hardware. Other than that I think most areas of IT have some level of code involved, even if it is just basic command line interface knowledge. But, again, I don't really have a lot of experience in networking or cyber security as it wasn't my concentration."

I have noticed that recently, my episodes seem to swing back and forth more quickly than they used to. I started out having occasional manic episodes lasting weeks-months, with mostly depression in-between. Now though, it seems I am changing states multiple times a month, with manic episodes lasting only days/maybe a week at a time.

BipolarReddit,fk894rh,t3_fgygjd,1583951688.0,"I used to think that big time. Always poor, always overworked, always in abusive relationships. Until this year. Moves in with my amazing boyfriend about a year ago. He makes enough money through disability to pay all our bills without me having to work much (still do freelance art and dog-sitting when I am healthy enough), he is amazingly caring and supportive, pays for health insurance for me so I can always afford my meds. No longer overworked, much less outside stressors, etc.

And it's still a shitshow in my head. Sometimes, it's almost worse because when I used to think if my situation was better, I'd be healthier, there was this sliver of hope of obtaining it. Like, I was at the bottom of a mountain looking up, thinking if I could just climb it things would be ok. But now I am on the top of the mountain. There isn't any higher to go. So now that hope that I could change it with a better situation is gone.

Sometimes I feel guilty for still being so miserable and unstable. Sometimes I am angry at my brain and body and genes. And sometimes I am able to give myself the grace to feel how I am gonna feel and just try to ride the waves as best I can.

Better situations can make some things better. I stay current on my meds, I have amazing support, I have systems in place to mitigate damage when I am manic. But the illness is never going to fade away. It will stay a part of my life forever. And I'm still struggling to be ok with that some days."
