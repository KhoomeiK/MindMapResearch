theCalaisPlan,fmhpioa,t3_fvc8xk,1586089455.0,"Yes, everything happens for a reason but those reasons are largely consequences of our actions and decisions. I really fucking hated this saying because I used to think - wtf - rape, pedophilia, cancer - happens for what reasons?  But that’s only looking at it from the end result - if we trace it back to the source - what caused people to hurt other people? What got broken in them to transform or create such vile creatures. Something happened - there was a reason - a chemical imbalance causes psychosis, a bad relationship made someone else susceptible to being controlled by a psycho. I’m oversimplifying but don’t dismiss my point - things, people, everything is set in motion by something else. 

The word reason is misleading - it implies that there is some kind of rationale or order - this is not the case. Reason here should be interpreted solely as consequence. We use this saying to bring comfort when we don’t have an answer as what caused something and powerless to fix it. It’s a way to inspire belief that there is a higher being who has a greater plan for us all. 

I recently got into an extremely tense argument with the person I love more than anything over this exact fucking saying. So it’s super interesting that I open up Reddit today to see this question being posed. 

Fuck.

If you are curious - we didnt come to an agreement. We agreed to disagree. Though - I’ve since around to his argument and apparently he has come around to mine. So we remain on opposite ends of this - just on different sides."

relationship_advice,fly6y7c,t3_frh4s1,1585596673.0,"Ummmm guys ... weddings are emotional events. People get swept up in the moment. OP’s guy wants to marry her, she said (didn’t she), she wants to be with him. He didn’t propose in the middle of her sister’s wedding, he did it when he thought they were alone. 

C’mon guys, I get the sister being a bridezilla, though, the hitting part is concerning. But can we focus on a small detail here - if you find someone you want to spend the rest of your life with, that’s something you should hold on to. Sure, he may have fucked up with timing but OP hasn’t mentioned a history of disregard and disrespect with him. You don’t throw an entire relationship or future away over one thing (exceptions occur, I get it Reddit, don’t eat me alive, you nitpicking numbskulls). 

OP - your real question is how to handle your pack. You’ve been dealing with them for ages. This will blow over, it’s your turn this week/months/6 months. Soon it will be Uncle Jack’s turn, for having a relationship with Aunt Marie’s twin sister. Your brood is dramatic, pick a good seat, hang on for the ride. 

And seriously, spend some time with yourself - if he is really the one, don’t fucking let him go."

He doesn’t reply half the time but he does make sure to call me every morning and when he has time during the day. He doesn’t plan anything, doesn’t remember my birthday or our anniversary but he is so happy when we are together. He has begged me, please, just try to enjoy our life together, don’t think that I don’t put the time into our relationship. I don’t know.
