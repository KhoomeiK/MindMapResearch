I don't have any magical help to give you, or silver-bullet advice. But your story really resonates with me. At one point I woke up, practically alone in life, working for peanuts, too mentally unwell to work full-time hours even, and also feeling like I had been educated for so much more than this.

I'm feeling a bit better now. A big thing for me was letting myself become someone who matters to someone else. At my worst, I felt like everyone was pulling away from me. Maybe there's truth to that, but I have since realized that I didn't want anyone near. People were too threatening. I could never really show myself to them or be a real part of their lives.

Now I make it a point to try to be a part of people's lives. Therapy helped me do this. Now my usual feeling is that my life matters because it's a part of the lives of other people who matter. I have my bad days where I don't feel that way, too, but they aren't as common as they used to be.

Well, I'm not trying to say if you just try harder everything will work out. But I stuck through the hard times and I'm here for the good times now. I believe it can work for you too. I hope you don't kill yourself."

I just want to clear up something about what I said about asexuals -- from the friends I talk to who identify that way, it isn't that they hate sex and don't want to have it. It's more like they don't care about it and see it as completely marginal in their lives. I'm sure that varies among different people though."

I think it's super common to associate important experiences with places. Especially when the experiences are painful. I think they fade with time. For instance, if you had to pass by your grandmother's house every day, you might stop feeling very strongly about it.

So when you are reminded of Adam at school, maybe try to focus on the moment? Like very clearly see and feel what's in front of you? Because reality is stronger than memory, even if it doesn't feel like it. And the reality of the moment will become the memories of tomorrow. I think it would be easier if you could hang out with your friends on campus and make new memories, but that's probably not going to work during the pandemic.

You can try this test to see: [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/tests/health/depression-test](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/tests/health/depression-test)

If you are depressed, it's important to keep doing the kinds of things that usually used to make you happy. Because the problem isn't with those things, it's with your ability to feel happy about them. If you keep doing them, then when your ability to feel happy comes back, even if only for a short while, you'll be already doing something you like.

Don't replace it with anything. Just do the things you have to do without thinking about it.

Imagine you're in a video game and this is what you have to do. You have study and then take a test. You aren't thinking ""Oh no, what if I fail?"" You just do it. That's what I'm talking about.

Going into full fight or flight mode is different from just feeling anxious. Normal anxiety is like having a knot in your gut and an uneasy feeling. Fight or flight is like your life is in danger right now.

Sometimes it's not easy to calm down from this state. You can do this:

a) Put your hand over your heart. This is very soothing for some reason.

b) Take a deep breathe. Cliche but useful.

c) Try to feel your feet on the ground or your butt on the chair. It helps ground you.

d) Tell yourself that you aren't in danger, you're going to be okay, and that it's safe enough to relax.

e) you might need to cry a little or shiver once you relax again. Shivering is something most animals do after danger. It's a nervous-system thing I guess.

If you are in public you can skip a) and e). When it happens to me in public I'll often go to the bathroom so I can do e).

If you have anxiety, therapy is really useful. You might think it's too much of a hassle, but believe me, it's worth it. Anxiety comes from wounds in our past, things that make us nervous and afraid in the present. Therapy can help heal those wounds.

I don't have a solution for it. But I think you should still talk to this guy anyway. Even if you feel crappy about yourself now, it sounds like he's sending a lot of signals that he'll say yes. 

There's an idea I learned in therapy called an ""emotionally corrective experience."" The idea is that some things we can fix in our heads *before* doing anything out in the world. But with other things, until we get some real responses from other people, we can't fully heal. And maybe until you get more positive feedback about your body, for instance from a supportive boyfriend, you might not be able to fully accept it. In other words, instead of trying to completely heal your self-image before asking him to be your boyfriend, maybe healing can only come afterwards.

I hope this is helpful. You're in a really tough position now that I wouldn't want anyone to be in. Just remember that people *should* like as much as you like yourself when you aren't being bullied.

The marks of my past will always be with me. But I'm no longer miserable -- I would even say I'm happy. I have a lot of supportive friends and a relationship that means a lot to me. 

So I guess you have to think about what your goal is. If you want to end up like someone who was never traumatized in the first place, that might not be possible (although for all I know it is possible). But if you want to be happy, comfortable in your own skin, and surrounded by people who care about you, it's completely doable.

Because in a way, you're grieving for your own past. You're grieving for the person you were who felt so much love for this stuffed animal.

After a long time, I'm pretty sure I don't have any suppressed memories kicking around that would help explain things.

In my case, I think it's just that I wasn't allowed to have boundaries as a child, emotionally or physically. I didn't feel like I belonged to me. And sexual situations are all about letting people through your boundaries. Also there is so much pressure from expectations -- at least from my expectations of my partner's expectations, and sometimes from my partner too. It's no surprise I can find it overwhelming.

Even if you don't have sexual trauma, trauma is trauma. It's something that can be healed in therapy. Also, you deserve to have a partner who appreciates who you are, including your trauma. You might want to consider dating someone who is asexual. It could take a lot of the pressure off. Also people who are asexual are usually sweethearts.

I've known my fair share of ""shrug it off, move forward"" kind of guys. I think it's something you get rewarded for being. Nobody likes a whiner and unfortunately its easy to have your real problems be seen as whining.

But just about every guy like this I've met is basically scared shitless inside. ""Shrug it off, move forward"" for so many guys seems more like ""Don't stop to acknowledge the pain or you will literally die."" A lot of people can make it through this way, but it's not an easy way to live, even if you can make it work. 

Based on my experience, you're probably dealing with some kind of trauma that's affecting you now. Trauma is a situation where your life feels like it's in danger and you feel powerless to do anything about it. To me, this gels with what you're saying about uncontrollable crying, lethargy, and black-out rage. These are all ways that people respond when faced with a traumatic situation. You're overwhelmed by how hard it is (crying and hyperventilation), you feel powerless (lethargy), and you are trying somehow or another to save your life (rage).

I'm not a professional, so don't take this too seriously. But this kind of thing is really common. Either way, the absolute best thing you can do is to see a therapist. Like u/Muted-Pace says, peer support is good too, but it's a supplement to therapy and not a replacement. It might be uncomfortable going to see a therapist after you've only just realized stuff is going on in your life. I can understand that. But you should take these symptoms seriously.

It's not easy stuff to figure out alone, even with a supportive and helpful girlfriend (she sounds great, by the way!)

Based on your post, I can't tell if your issue is with *feeling* emotions or *expressing* them. You say expressing but people sometimes say that when they mean feeling. If the trouble is with feeling them, the best way is to try to connect with your body. Our feelings are in our body. Turn the light off and lay down in your bed. Put your attention on the different parts of your body. Try not to think too many thoughts, and instead focus on the sensations. Where are you tense? Your belly? Your face? Your shoulders? 

Often when we get tense, especially in these three areas, there is a feeling there. As you pay attention to it, the muscles will relax, and you'll get an emotion flooding in. At least, that's how it works for me. You can watch this video if you're curious: [https://youtu.be/MmKfzbHzm\_s](https://youtu.be/MmKfzbHzm_s)

If the problem is with expressing your feelings, then try acting exercises. Actors have to convey feelings clearly. I know it isn't easy to do this under social distancing, but it's something you can fool around with in front of the bathroom mirror if you're comfortable with that. What would an angry person look like? What would a curious person look like? Try to make it as exaggerated as possible.

Well, these are just some suggestions. Don't be disheartened if they don't seem to lead anywhere. Really it takes a trained therapist to lead you through the confusing world of your own mind.

From what you describe, it sounds like you're experiencing depersonalization. That's where you don't feel like a person anymore -- you might usually see yourself as if you were floating above your own head, for example. Like you are a video game character and your mind is the player's POV. 

I felt that way before, and for me it was part of dissociation. It came along with derealization, where everything feels unreal. Things feel just hypothetical. It also came with disembodiment, where I had trouble connecting with the sensations in my body.

If that sounds right for you, therapy can help. I never took medications specifically for dissociation so I can't speak about that. But therapy was really useful. My therapist helped me connect to my body and my feelings, and then taught me how to process them so that they weren't causing me so much pain. If you're curious about the body aspect, you should watch this video: [https://youtu.be/MmKfzbHzm\_s](https://youtu.be/MmKfzbHzm_s)

Just remember, you didn't do anything wrong. You never actually stopped being human.

changemyview,fqzgsgx,t1_fqypubd,1589767057.0,"After reading your comment I realized I was kind of mixing two different problems into my response. The first one is the problem of assimilation. I agree that dissolving the reservation system will not mean immediate and automatic assimilation. However, I think it will make it happen much more quickly. One major reason is that Indigenous cultures are so tied to Indigenous economic practices. For example, there are so many stories, ceremonies, words, and traditions connected to picking certain plants. If no Indigenous people are picking these plants anymore, then the traditions become text-book curiosities (if they survive at all).

Having reservations -- where property cannot be bought and sold -- forces poverty on a lot of Indigenous people. But for others, it keeps the old economic activities alive. And you might be surprised to find how economically viable some of these activities are. I can't give you any numbers or links, but anecdotally a lot of people a lot of people are getting by this way.

So, if Indigenous people are just folded into the overall workforce, Indigenous cultural practices will just become part of ""song and dance multiculturalism,"" something people do on weekends. It isn't pure cultural destruction, but it's not something we can look on as a desirable option.

The second problem I mixed into my last post is the question of sovereignty. We've never given up the idea that we are sovereign nations, and in Canada it's something codified into the Royal Proclamation of 1763. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, the acknowledgment of Indigenous sovereignty in this proclamation was one of the reasons that Americans decided to revolt against Britain.) Reservations, even if they are like prisons in some respects, are also difficult for the federal government to fiddle around with. They keep Indigenous communities secure so that the hope of a truly nation to nation relationship can stay alive.

I should add that the Wet'suwet'en, whose recent battles with pipeline construction set all of Canada into crisis back in February, won a court case back in 1997 acknowledging that their title has never been extinguished. It is possible to imagine that in Canada, today's reservations will be the nuclei of larger Indigenous-administered areas. Because of the Royal Proclamation and the Delgamuukw 1997 court case, Indigenous title is a live legal question, and not just a question of whether Canada at large decides if it feels like being nice today. This is something covered in the essay I linked you before, I think.

I'm glad you like the essay! That essayist, Alicia Elliott, has a book out recently called ""A Mind Spread Out on the Ground."" I really enjoyed it. Also, I understand what you mean about how picking the right words can be difficult. I think you are right to focus on actions and not words, although it's good to try to use the up-to-date words when you know them."
changemyview,fqymeu9,t3_glicq7,1589750957.0,"I'm mixed Native and have never lived on the Rez. I have some thoughts about this though.

Part of the idea that reservations should be eliminated is that Native people should just integrate with the rest of society. On the one hand, as u/sober2ndthought says, this usually means integrating into society on the bottom rung, subject to racism and humiliation. But also, as u/friendlystonergirl points out, reservations are places to carry on tradition.

The thing is, ""integration"" can sometimes be the same as ""finally completing cultural genocide."" Native people are not just a minority like any other. We're people who were subsumed into a different country against our will. The reservations are part of that history of conquest, but dissolving the reservations would probably be just another, more complete step in the conquest. Once there is really no difference between Native people and everyone else, colonialism has succeeded.

Here in Canada, the government has been trying to integrate Native people for hundreds of years. That was the idea behind the Residential schools, which are now acknowledged to be horrifying places, where Native children were taught to be ashamed of their cultures and languages. It was also the idea behind the White Paper in 1969, which was an attempt by the left-leaning Liberal government to abolish the Indian Act. That event actually ignited Native people to become politically active, and ushered in the modern era of settler-Indigenous relations. 

The consistent message coming from Native people is that what is needed is a nation to nation relationship. That means acknowledging that Native people have been independent, sovereign political units before being taken over by Canada, America, and other settler countries, and that that sovereignty exists today in some meaningful form. If you are curious about this, here is a good essay to read: [""Memo to Canada: Indigenous People are Not Your Incompetent Children.""](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/indigenous-memo-to-canada-were-not-your-incompetent-children/article37511319/)

He asked me a lot of questions, but not in a way where it's like ""Tell me, how does it feel to be you?"" but more like a regular doctor who's trying to see if you have any old illness. 

I asked my friend about this, who says she's seen a few different psychiatrists, and she said that was her experience too. It shouldn't be scary, I think, but I just wanted you to be warned that it usually isn't warm and cuddly.

You wrote: ""I’m worried that he’s just gonna sit me down ask if I’m sick, throw happy pills at me and kick me out of the room.""

Well, that's basically what I'm trying to say my experience was like -- but in your words it sounds worse than it was. The job of the psychiatrist is to figure out if you need medication, and if you do what kind you need. They will just sit you down, figure out what's going on with you, prescribe you medication, and ask you to leave. But it's an important part of dealing with mental health problems. If you keep in mind that the psychiatrist isn't a warm and cuddly therapist, I don't think it will be too tough. (And, once in a while, you do get a warm and cuddly psychiatrist. You never know).

Also, I don't think you need to worry about being sent to the psych ward. Like u/exokkir said, that only happens if you're a threat to yourself or others. (That's the exact phrase they always use)."
mentalhealth,fquy19m,t1_fqurtd5,1589666270.0,"I don't think I can ever convince you beyond a shadow of a doubt that your read on things is wrong and mine is right. Like you say, everything in your life has confirmed these ideas for you. If they were obviously self-contradictory you would have figured it out by now. 

In other words, I can never prove to you that your three-category picture of society is wrong. I have lots of reasons why I think it's wrong, but in the end you'll be able to explain why your picture of things can account for those too. 

For example, I think it's easily observable that there are plenty of ugly people who feel happy and accepted. That's not to say they don't have it harder, but that the relationship between rejection and looks is way more elastic than you appear to believe. So, that's what I think, but you could always say that the fact that they're accepted shows that they are better looking than I thought. I'm not the judge of beauty, others are, and if others accept someone they must not be that ugly. Just to be clear, I don't know if you would actually argue that. It's just an example of how nothing I can say can *definitively* disprove your perspective.

So what are we going to do? I can't prove you're wrong, and you can't prove you're right either. We're stuck with a choice between two alternatives, and we can never be truly certain which one is right.

If you choose never to explore the possibility that your view is wrong, it will keep you relatively comfortable. But it will also mean that you live in a threatening world where cruelty is the norm and your fate is to be eternally isolated. That's not the kind of thing we usually want to be right about.

On the other hand, if you choose to explore the possibility that the world is different, then there is the hope that things will change. In the picture that I'm laying out for you, childhood trauma has left you sensitized to hurts that others feel less painfully, it causes you to gravitate to abusive situations, and it has exposed you to bullying and mistreatment that others might not have received. All the bad things that happened to you really did happen, but rather than being the result of some biologically ordained social hierarchy, they are the result of inner wounds that can be healed. Therapy and other practices can make it possible for you to connect to kind, respectful people who want to accept you regardless of what you look like. It's not a perfect world where people are always respected and cared for, but it's a world where respect, care, and unselfish love are possible.

So, if I can't prove that you are wrong, you can't prove that I am wrong either. You can choose to gamble on being right and miserable, but you also might just as well gamble on being wrong and happy."
PhilosophyMemes,fqurcyk,t3_gkzxx6,1589663408.0,"I feel really ambivalent about this though. I definitely felt alienated from friends and family, and society more generally, after doing a philosophy BA. It's been about a year now since I graduated (so glad not to be studying during this pandemic) and I feel like I'm back to normal now. I can connect with the people I meet on the street or in a supermarket in a way that feels comfortable and natural.

In the end, it leaves me feeling like there's something a bit cult-y about philosophy departments. They don't just want to teach you about ideas, they're trying to acculturate you to a certain way of doing things. For example, you're supposed to take everything literally all the time. Philosophers laugh at normies for saying things that, if taken literally, are preposterous, but in a way this is just a kind of willing illiteracy. The best example that comes to mind is when Bertrand Russell makes fun of his servant for saying ""He ain't never done nothing to hurt nobody,"" which if taken literally means ""He has at some point done something to hurt somebody."" But of course that isn't what she meant. Now, I know there are nuanced philosophies of language that do account for things like this. I'm just saying it's like a cultural habit among philosophers to compare themselves to the normies over things like this, only to laugh at the normies.

Now that I've written all that, I'm not sure that it's exactly relevant to the meme. I guess I just needed to get that off my chest."
mentalhealth,fqupimw,t3_gksk39,1589662598.0,"This used to be my life for years. I would get mostly good and pretty hopeful once every two months or so, and it would only last a couple days (with a couple more days of *maybe I'm still feeling good*) before life went back to be exhausting and unenjoyable. It was really excruciating, especially because I kept wondering, is this going to be my life forever? Will I only ever get glimpses of an enjoyable, rewarding life?

Well, in the end I broke through to the other side, and now my life is basically the same ratio in reverse -- every two months or so I feel like crap for about a week, but otherwise I feel mostly good. There was no one thing that made the difference. School had been really hard for me, and when I graduated I was able to spend more time on self-care. Moving away from bad living situations was absolutely necessary. Working a job that didn't make me hate my life was important too. Plus, I was doing therapy the whole time, and it was a style of therapy that really gelled with me.

I guess if I would say anything to myself back when I was where you are now, I would say don't beat yourself up for being depressed. Don't jump to the conclusion that this will last forever. Just make a plan to do the things that should help you heal, and keep doing those things. 

When you're stuck in the bog of depression, things feel so hopeless. Recovery seems impossible. But it only seems impossible until it happens, and it happens to a lot of people. I wish you the best of luck on your healing journey."
mentalhealth,fqumrcl,t1_fqrnsyi,1589661385.0,"This sounds really tough. I don't think people should have treated you this way.

When you say you had a string of abusive girlfriends, to you that might just be a confirmation of what life is like. But to me, it points to a disposition you already had to put yourself in situations where you would be abused. That usually points to earlier childhood abuse. You don't mention anything before the age of 14, but it's usually before the age of ten that the really influential things happen.

I can imagine that you'll be skeptical about this, so let me put it to you another way. Suppose someone grows up being treated like they aren't worthwhile, depending on confirmation from others in order to feel okay, and being punished for being too vocal about their own needs. Then *of course* once this person starts dating they'll fall in with abusers. That's their comfort zone. They've been trained from childhood not to ask for too much or be too presumptuous, so they can only get intimacy from people who are willing to ignore all their boundaries. 

If that sounds like you, then we should look at your girlfriends and later experiences as the aftereffects of childhood trauma. You have been moulded by childhood experience to fit into abusive situations, and so when offered a thousand opportunities you'll almost inevitably find the abusive one. 

It gets worse, too, because it's often kids who are really traumatized who get picked on at school. People who seem not to have boundaries are magnets for bullies. Also, students tend to pick on people who stand out, and being traumatized makes you stand out. For example, I used to compulsively pick my nose in elementary school, which is a classic sign of anxiety. Far from getting me more help and support, it actually made me a target for bullying. It's cruel, but that's the way schools work right now.

Now, I realize there's something Matrix-y about this explanation. Here you are making what are from your perspective reasonable conclusions about reality, but because your experience was shaped by outside forces, your sense of what's true about the world is off. It seems improbable from our normal way of thinking about things. But really, I wouldn't float an idea like this if I didn't think it were true. Isn't this a more reasonable explanation for your life, when the alternative means believing that the life everyone else talks about is just a lie and an illusion?"

From the sounds of it, you're dealing with complex PTSD. Regular PTSD is when something traumatic happens to you and really affects your life. Complex trauma is when you get that trauma repeatedly over a long period of time, especially from a caregiver. Here are some of the symptoms:

""In addition to the symptoms of PTSD, including enduring reminders of trauma, the studies [revealed](https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f585833559) three distinct signs of C-PTSD: difficulties managing interpersonal relationships; a compromised ability to control emotional reactions; a negative self-image. This triad of difficulties is referred to in the literature as disturbances in self-organisation (DSO). In fact, the research shows that C-PTSD was more common (in one study, [three times](http://dx.doi.org.ezproxylocal.library.nova.edu/10.1016/j.jad.2016.09.032) more common) than PTSD alone."" (From this article: [https://aeon.co/essays/contextual-trauma-therapy-can-limit-the-impact-of-a-toxic-childhood](https://aeon.co/essays/contextual-trauma-therapy-can-limit-the-impact-of-a-toxic-childhood))

The phrases ""negative self-image"" and ""difficulty managing interpersonal relationships"" sound pretty mild. But they are meant to encompass some very extreme things. ""Negative self-image"" can mean the deep-down conviction that you are unlovable, disgusting, and deserve to be hated. ""Difficulty managing interpersonal relationships"" can mean a poison in all intimacy, careening between feeling like you'll die without people close to you only to feel that the people close to you are going to kill you.

With that in mind, what you're describing in your post sounds a lot like complex PTSD. I find it more plausible to believe that you are suffering from ""negative self-image"" than that you are as utterly ugly as you think. There are few people so ugly that it affects their life as much as you believe your looks are affecting your life. Instead, the other symptom, ""difficulty managing interpersonal relationships,"" seems to explain your problems with friends and dating better. 

If you actually did experience repeated abuse and neglect as a child, including poverty, substance abuse in the home, chaotic behaviour from other people in the home, and so on, then that should seal the deal. As kids, we adapt to the chaotic world we grow up in. But the things that help us survive in an abusive home are also the things that make it hard to function as an adult.

I want to add that if you are have complex PTSD, you are probably giving on signals that women can detect. Even without opening your mouth, just by your body language, posture, expression, and your eyes, you can convey a sense that you see the world as threatening. This is a huge red flag for women, who are putting their lives on the line sometimes by going on dates. If women seem to reject you out of hand, it's more likely that you are sending out signals that make you look dangerous than that they just can't be bothered with you.

If I'm right about your childhood, then the bitterness you feel is a reasonable response to things that really happened to you. It doesn't reflect the reality of the world you live in now, but the reality of the world you grew up in. You don't have to stay trapped in the world of your childhood, though. With therapy, you can heal the wounds of the past and start to see the present differently. I urge you to reach out to a therapist and start working on this stuff. Don't let the past poison the future."
mentalhealth,fqr6qgi,t3_gkh86i,1589578630.0,"Well, I have gotten over burnout before, but only by cutting my hours. I was doing 6 shifts a week and went down to four (the shifts were usually 5 hours). I had them staggered out so I usually had a day to rest between shifts.

I think it really depends on what's going on with you. If you're prone to depression and anxiety, then burnout is not going to be just burnout. It's one part of an extended issue. That's how it was for me. I'm not sure I ever could have been happy working some of the jobs I did, because my mental health is already not great.

On the other hand, if you don't have existing mental health concerns to worry about, then some self-care basics might help. Do you do self-care stuff? For example, when you get home, before you do anything else you can sit down somewhere comfortable and check in with your body. You can pay attention to the muscles in your arms and legs, in your shoulders, your gut, the muscles on your face. These are places where we store a lot of tension. Doing this can help you relax. It might also bring up some other feelings like anger, sadness, anxiety, and so on. This gives you an opportunity to deal with these feelings straight away instead of having them only pop up when you're trying to fall asleep later.

Well, I hope this helps. I know burnout is no joke."

I think you do have anxiety, but I think what you are describing is more than that. It sounds like you are getting into a fight-or-flight mode where your body is acting like there is a crisis. It's more than anxiety, it's panic. I don't know if it counts as a panic *attack*, but it sounds more intense than anxiety alone.

Do you have a therapist or another mental health professional to talk to? If not, I know it can seem so hard to get one, but believe me it makes such a difference. I really encourage you to reach out.

I used to get into fight-or-flight mode all the time, and it was very hard to deal with. My therapist taught me to do this:

1) put my hand over my heart, 

2) breathe deeply, 

3) try to feel my feet on the ground, and

4) tell myself that I'm not reacting to anything that's actually dangerous in the moment. Tell myself I'm *allowed* to calm down and relax, I'm going to be okay.

I hope this helps. If you don't have a therapist, I really hope you reach out to one, because usually this kind of fear is based on something that happened to us. You need help healing your fear. Anyway, I'm wishing the best for you."

You will actually be doing something kind to yourself by paying attention to your needs. 

I would add that in this situation especially, it sounds like it's not a question of ""Will I enjoy myself or not?"" It's a question of ""Will I be miserable or not?"" Even if there is a low chance of being miserable, misery is a big risk to take!

If you are worried about what your friends will think, I encourage you not to. Your friends can't figure out what will be right for you. They have to learn that from you. You can take the lead on meeting your own needs and your friends can follow behind.

Just remember, healing doesn't mean already being as mentally healthy as you wish you were. It means looking at what the next sensible step will be. Soon enough the steps add up and you have come a long way from where you were before."

You don't have to worry about if you ""should"" have these thoughts. If they are showing up, they are showing up, and that's all. We can call these thoughts ""intrusive thoughts"" because they come in when you didn't intend to think about them. They are a sign that something is going on with you, even if it isn't something you're aware of.

When I say that, I don't want to scare you. There isn't anything horrible going on inside you. But there might be some things that you aren't aware of. Often when painful things happen to us, we try to forget. Sometimes intrusive thoughts come because there is something painful like that in our past (we call it trauma).

The best thing to do is talk to a therapist or another mental health professional. It can sometimes be hard to find one, especially these days with the pandemic. But there is no replacement for it. Most therapists are kind and understanding people who are knowledgeable enough to find out what's going on with you. If you aren't sure how to get a therapist, try reaching out to someone you trust. Is there someone in your family or at school that you feel comfortable asking?

In the end, we want to take these thoughts seriously. They seem uncomfortable to you and they might be a sign of other things going on. You don't need to be alarmed though. Intrusive thoughts alone are not dangerous, and it sounds like you have some good supports. I encourage you to connect with a therapist and learn about what's going on with you :)"

My advice is email anyone you think cares about you and literally just copy-paste this post you wrote here. And when I say someone you *think* cares about you, I mean that. It's so easy to feel like nobody cares about you when you're depressed. Just pretend that you're someone else and ask, does it seem like this person cares about ""me""?

Literally, so many people are more caring than you might expect. I don't know what your situation is like, and it's possible that all of your email contacts are horrible uncaring people, but I think it's better to assume otherwise.

I had the same experience, and from what I understand it's common for most people. But I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, not OCD, and I never took medication for OCD or anxiety (although I did take anti-depressants). 

Basically, this is what happened to me and to a lot of others: before we start to work on healing, we keep trying to tell ourselves that everything is normal. We keep up the appearance that everything is fine even though we feel broken inside. 

Then, once we open up, SO MUCH comes out that we didn't know about. All kinds of intense feelings, painful memories, and so on. It all comes out of the woodwork. Life just goes a bit topsy turvy.

But I think it's for the best. When you're in denial, things are more comfortable in some ways, but you have no path forward. You just have to hope that your issues go away, or that your life will change. Once you start to do some work on yourself, things can be tough, but you always have a way forward. Many people have dealt with the same things (a lot of them on this subreddit) and you don't have to be alone with what's hurting you.

Personally, I would love to see the day when we don't have to have things fall apart. I think it can be done somehow. I don't know how, though, and until then most people will have to deal with this falling-apart feeling.

The thing is, you don't need to have something special about you to be worthwhile. You don't have to be smart, good looking, popular, and so on. I mean, does a rock need to do anything special to be a worthwhile rock? No, it's just a rock. That's a silly question. People are the same way. We don't need to prove that we deserve to exist anymore than a rock or a bird or a star.

If you do therapy, you'll learn how to feel differently about yourself. It's really worth it. Even if it takes a long time before you feel like you've ""made it,"" each stage of the journey brings rewards. If finding a therapist is hard right now, then looking for information about self-esteem can be really useful.

From what you say, I can't tell if your friend is open to the idea of getting better or not. Do they want to, but feel trapped and unable, or do they just not even want to?

If they aren't interested in getting better, there isn't very much you can do. You can't change someone's mind for them. You can still be their friend, and that will help, but that's about it. It's a painful position to be in, I know. With time it might change.

If they are open to the idea of healing, then that's very encouraging. Even if they can't get help for it now, there is light at the end of the tunnel. I encourage you to help them get a therapist. 

I agree that you can't be a therapist for your friend. But that doesn't mean you can't be their friend. Just to witness what they're going through and care about them is helpful. You can listen to their thoughts and worries too. Remember, though, that you aren't responsible for how they are feeling, and that you must stop when it gets overwhelming for you.

mentalhealth,fqo3n5l,t3_gjtavv,1589506902.0,"Unlike the other commenters, I think there is something to what you're saying. I wouldn't say that info about mental health is doing more damage than good, but I would say that it does sometimes do damage that we don't always acknowledge.

Specifically, I'm thinking about the role of self-knowledge in mental health today. I think what a lot of people need is not more self-knowledge, but more support. In my experience, the big difference between people whose mental health is really hurting them and everyone else is that we (people with mental health problems) often lack the networks of friends, family supports, social and emotional skills, and respect from society that help a person feel safe and wanted. 

Of course, mental health problems make it hard to build up support networks. But I think if you see someone suffering, you would help them a lot more by trying to get them engaged in a support network than in asking them about their childhood. In other words, since both our trauma and the people around us are factors in good mental health, I don't understand why we place all our emphasis on trauma. 

So, if ignorance was bliss, it was only that learning is not 100% of the answer. To never get any self-knowledge, dive into your trauma, etc, but to be surrounded by loving and supportive people -- to me, that sounds way better than to be all alone but full of self-knowledge.

However, we shouldn't imagine that the past is full of supportive networks like this. It was true for a lot of people, but so many people fell through the cracks. If self-knowledge isn't 100% of the answer, I think it is still part of the answer."
changemyview,fqo1nqe,t3_gjr5jk,1589505746.0,"I want to disagree with your position here, but I want to say first that I can understand where you're coming from. These are normal questions to ask and I wouldn't want you to feel forced into changing your mind against your will.

First of all, words have meanings independent of your intentions. You can't shout ""Fire!"" in a crowded theatre and then say that what you meant by that is ""I hope we all enjoy this movie."" (It makes me a bit sad to remember the days when people were in crowded theatres together!) I think you'll agree to that.

So that means that a person's intentions aren't the end of the story. You can say something nicely which is actually very rude. For a real life example of this, I'll tell you something that happened to me. I have studied Japanese for many years, although I wouldn't say I'm very good. I was at a dinner party where the host family was Japanese, and I tried to thank them at the end in Japanese. Unfortunately, I used an informal る ending instead of a more polite ます ending. The hostess stiffened when I said that, looking a bit hurt. My friend apologized for me and I corrected my mistake. I think she understood that I meant no harm, but when you hear something insulting, it gets to you automatically. It's a split-second thing.

Unfortunately, there are words in every language that are demeaning or insulting to particular groups. This is true by race, gender, sexuality, and so on. As long as people keep using the words this way, they will continue to mean something rude or disrespectful, regardless of our intentions when we use them.

But you had a more specific worry. What about situations where this particular group is not around? If they aren't around to feel disrespected, doesn't that mean that no harm has been done?

Well, I don't think so. Because words like this are disrespectful regardless of whether someone feels disrespected or not. Of course, when there are no consequences, it's hard to feel like it's such a bad thing. If you are alone in bed at night, snuggling in your blankets and you whisper the n-word to yourself -- it's hard for me to get upset about that. But I think there are more consequences to using these words around friends than you might think.

Once you get in the habit of talking around your friends and family as if no black people were around, then once you *are* around black people, you will have to change your behaviour. This will mean that being around black people adds a bit of extra work to your life, and you might find it annoying, which will influence your interactions with black people. If a lot of people act the same way, then black people will feel that they are always making a situation more awkward just by being there. Everyone has to strain to make them feel at home. It's hard to feel at home when you're causing a strain on others.

So I think it's good to avoid using words that would disrespect people, even when they're not around. It means that the space you're living and talking in is already prepared to make them feel comfortable. 

By the way, I want to acknowledge that the word ""respect"" can be tricky. When people already have power and prestige, they may demand ""respect"" when they mean being treated as better than everyone else. In that case, disrespect is ""lèse-majesté."" I don't think we need to avoid criticizing the king of Thailand, for instance, although some people will feel that it's disrespectful. When I say respect, I mean treating people as fully human. Disrespect means indicating that they are someone less than human and deserving. This is a tricky distinction to make, but I think a sincere inquirer will not have too much trouble finding the difference."

I also like the book ""The Body Keeps the Score"" by Bessel van der Kolk. This book is more academic and not as accessible. But it's very deep and useful. Bessel van der Kolk researches brain development and its connection to the body. He has a lot of insights about how our bodies are connected to our feelings. If you're curious, you can look at this Youtube video he did: [https://youtu.be/MmKfzbHzm\_s](https://youtu.be/MmKfzbHzm_s)

Anyway, good luck on your mental health journey!"
mentalhealth,fqg37ty,t3_gio4ja,1589337022.0,"I hope you don't kill yourself. This late in the game, I feel way out of my depth to say something that will bring you back. But really, don't do it. You can call a suicide hotline and talk things out.

If you feel like you *could* be persuaded to live, but you aren't sure that you want to commit, find an inaccessible place to put the gun. Try burying it, or freezing it, or leaving it somewhere that's not around the house. 

I won't tell you that there's so much to live for, blah blah blah, because I know how it feels to be in that space. Just remember that *lots* of people have gotten to where you are now, lived, and been glad to be alive. Whatever's going on with you, even if it's been with you your whole life, it doesn't have to be your future."
changemyview,fqg2k4b,t3_gihwk2,1589336623.0,"I just want to jump in and say that the idea of ""literal truth"" is a bit of a problem here. Nowadays we are used to thinking of literal truth as the bed-rock of existence, and anything metaphorical as something extra on top. But this sense of literal truth is historically a late development. Ancient texts are highly metaphorical, and non-metaphorical texts are few and far between. Poetry came first and prose only developed over time. 

Look at the work of Francis Bacon, for instance (who lived in England 1561 to 1626). He's considered the father of modern science. His writings are peppered with metaphors, however, and it is not by any means easy to tell where he is being metaphorical and where he is being literal.

It was around this time, too, that people started to read the Bible literally. Only with Martin Luther (1483-1546) and the Protestant reformation did literal readings of the Bible seem normal. The Catholic church had always been committed to reading the Bible in a mixture of literal and metaphorical which was always negotiable. (Negotiable amongst the church elite, of course. No one was allowed to negotiate this stuff *with* the church).

It was only in the age of Enlightenment, in the 1700's, that the idea of a literal truth without any metaphorical tinges really came into its own. And even then, it didn't look quite the way we think of it now. As an example, the concept of objectivity, which is so important to our idea of literal truth, was only created in the 1800's. 

So, long story short, it doesn't make sense to think of sacred scriptures as fundamentally literal, with metaphorical parts as ""cherry picking"". They have always had a mixture of literal and metaphorical which readers have to navigate and interpret. 

However, I don't know that this will really change your mind. We still have to decide in each case what the best reading of a certain passage will be, and it may be that choosing to interpret it metaphorically *will* be a kind of cherry picking. But we can only make these decisions on a case by case basis, and they'll always be somewhat open to interpretation."
mentalhealth,fqg0fdh,t3_gio7x3,1589335351.0,"I'm proud of you for sharing your story. When people realize that it can happen to anyone, I think they'll understand better. 

I think a lot of people don't want to believe in mental health because they feel like they are in danger. Sometimes you just have to keep forging ahead and ignoring whatever pain you have, or else you'll die. Then, even when it's safe to relax and start healing, you might feel like you can't afford to. Life still feels like an emergency. 

So I'm just thinking it might be like that for Filipinos. I have a lot of Filipino friends and it seems to be true about their parents.

Anyway, I'm glad you've made mental health a priority in your life. Good luck with everything."
mentalhealth,fqfzbgr,t3_giknz7,1589334708.0,"Hey, it sounds like you're in a tough position. I would hate to feel like that with people who are supposed to be my friends. I'm sorry you're going through this right now.

I had many years of trying to keep up with my friends in university while I was just out there working. I can totally relate to the maddening feeling of just being *behind.* Now that I've got a degree, I think that feeling is mostly BS. Of course, you learn a lot of important things at university, but the main thing that makes other people feel behind is just the culture that people pick up at university. You learn all the received ideas, and so you feel comfortable sharing the same set of prejudices. For instance, I studied philosophy and I hardly read Plato. But I picked up all the things that people at university think are *obvious* about Plato.

What bugs me is that I don't actually know Plato better now than I did before. In fact, before, I came to it with a very open mind, and I probably could have learned a lot by reading a few pages of Plato. Now, my head has been stuffed with these received ideas, and it's a lot harder for me to think about him in a fresh way.

So, if you're feeling left behind, I think a LOT of it is just because you lack all the received ideas people pick up at university. That's an advantage, though! The university bargain is to seem like you know about everything by taking it all for granted. If you aren't in university, you can wrestle with these ideas face to face. 

So I say, stick to your guns! If something seems right to you, your friends with degrees should be able to explain clearly why it doesn't seem right to them. If they don't, if they just act embarrassed that you didn't know *of course that's wrong*, then shame on them! They've let in-group status seeking destroy the intellectual adventure.

I hope this helps. Anyway, I really relate to what you're talking about; like I said, that was my life before I went to school. It can be really hard feeling good enough to be a part of the conversation. But take it from someone who went through school after that -- you are good enough to belong in the conversation!"
mentalhealth,fqfw3rr,t3_gifzoo,1589332854.0,"I've had this experience before, where life seems to have no point. I would think, ""If only things could be different,"" but then I couldn't imagine any change that would actually make a difference. It seemed like nothing would make me happy.

This happens to so many people, usually as a part of depression. Depression doesn't just bum you out, it also makes everything feel pointless. You feel in pain on the one hand, things seem pointless on the other hand, so you've got to wonder why you keep going through it all.

But I encourage you to look on that feeling as an effect of depression. It isn't that things have really lost their point, it's just that you aren't able to connect to that anymore. 

After going through therapy, I feel good about life. Things seem meaningful and worthwhile. I don't need to *find* some point to them, they just *are* meaningful. For instance, when I help up my friend and his eyes light up. He feels genuinely grateful that I could help him. That's the kind of experience that just grounds me in life. I don't need some kind of explanation for why it has a point.

I have a degree in philosophy, and I'm certainly not against questioning the meaning of life and things like that. I just hope that while you're thinking about the point of everything, you keep in mind that you're in a certain place in your life right now, and there are some parts of life that you can't see clearly. Don't get stuck in ""paralysis by analysis"" -- heal while you think."
mentalhealth,fqfsmfg,t3_gikwbm,1589330895.0,"Well, it's a fact that there is no agreement about why therapy works. There have been studies done about how effective different therapies are, and overall they all seem to work about the same. That doesn't mean that each one is just as good *for you* as the others -- probably one style will work better. But taking everyone into account, there isn't a huge difference in effectiveness between different styles.

I read an article ( [https://aeon.co/essays/how-attachment-theory-works-in-the-therapeutic-relationship](https://aeon.co/essays/how-attachment-theory-works-in-the-therapeutic-relationship) ) about why therapy is like this. The author's idea is that basically, we learn how to treat ourselves from our parents. When things go wrong, we don't learn how to treat ourselves well, and we can end up depressed and anxious. A therapist teaches us how to treat ourselves by treating us that way. We show them who we are, the things we're ashamed of, the things that hurt us, and they react to these things the way a kind parent should. Just having someone who knows what's going on with us, and cares about what happens to us, is so healing.

tldr -- in therapy you don't fake it till you make it. You get the experience of someone seeing the things you're ashamed of as not so bad, the things that hurt you as really bad, etc. When people treat you like a legit human being, you start to feel more positive and secure. That's the theory anyway, but it fits with my experience"
mentalhealth,fqbajpl,t3_ghrbtd,1589233470.0,"Hey, I'm sorry things are so hard. I just wanted to say that things like hallucinations and derealization (the sense that things aren't real) have happened to lots of people on this subreddit. This is very confusing and hard to deal with, but it's not totally uncommon.

I think the other commenters are right that you need to find some support in your life. Think of the most trustworthy adult you know of and talk to them about it. I know it's scary, but you can't get through this alone. You need buddies to help and support you.

I think medication can help too. If you have a therapist or counsellor right now try talking to them about it. They can send you to a psychiatrist. If you don't have a therapist or a counsellor, it's possible to see a psychiatrist on your own. A trusted adult can help you find one.

Everything will be okay. Just reach out to the people in your life. You don't have to face these things alone. We're all rooting for you over here."
mentalhealth,fqb9mab,t1_fqb7hod,1589232995.0,"I'm a bit of a visible person. I didn't feel like it when I started therapy, but looking back I knew people who got less attention and support than I did. 

If you aren't showing up on people's radar, part of the problem can be people's general perceptions. For instance, I gained a lot of weight in the past 5 years, and it's like I suddenly became invisible to a lot of people. Unfortunately that's the way it is. On the other hand, your own mental health can be a huge factor too. Sometimes we want to be invisible on some level, because we don't want to be mocked or punished. So we fade into the background to protect ourselves, only to feel neglected later on.

It's interesting that you bring up the phrase toxic masculinity, because it was actually coined by a bunch of male therapists in the 90's who were trying to understand their own lives. They realized a lot of the stuff they had been raised with was hurting them now. It's true that a lot of people use the word as an insult now, but I think it's worth remembering that it was originally a word for men to recognize their own lives with.

I'm not sure that I was in a good spot when I started therapy. I was flat broke, I had cut my family out of my life because they made me feel suicidal, I wasn't in school and was living off of welfare. This was age 20 or so. I was (and am) dealing with complex PTSD, a kind of problem which makes regular life functioning seem impossible, poisons your intimate relationships, and causes excruciating emotional pain.

After that, I had some very traumatic things happen to me that absolutely shattered me for a while. For years I thought I was just going to end up as a wreck on life's shore, one of those people that no one realizes is gone. Whatever I had going for me didn't matter, because it wasn't enough to rescue my life. When you're drowning it doesn't really matter if you're drowning in an ocean or a puddle. Either way you're drowning.

Now that I'm feeling better, I can see I had a lot of good luck and things that were working in my favour. But I can only say that in retrospect, now that I know that it all added up to ""enough."" Instead of comparing your problems with mine, it might help more to compare your problems to what ""enough"" would look like. What would be the tipping point where you aren't drowning anymore?"
mentalhealth,fqb7321,t3_ghw7p6,1589231725.0,"My experiences with therapy have been really good. They completely changed my life. Not only am I more stable and more functional, but I feel like I understand myself better. I'm able to have better relationships with people, more aware of how I feel, and I feel more grounded in my life. Plus, once you get used to the rhythms of therapy, you can get a real rush out of it. There's something about healing which is kind of... metal. Like facing your darkest demons and making friends with them, bringing them onto your side.

I never felt like my being a man was a problem. In fact, I'm a bit confused about your comment, where you say therapists treat males like broken females. I'm not sure what exactly you mean by that. I wonder if you mean the way that therapists encourage men to take on qualities and skills that we often think of as being women's.

I think that's true, but from my perspective, it isn't that therapists treat men like broken women. It's that there's something a bit messed up about our ideas of manhood. So many men live like they're on the brink, they can't truly trust anyone, they can never show vulnerability or suffering. This is a terrible burden to carry, and I think it's one of the reasons the suicide rate for men is so much higher than for women.

The solution that many therapists use is to encourage men to get in touch with their feelings, articulate how they feel in their relationships, and feel comfortable showing their suffering and vulnerability. I can imagine that someone would see that as treating men like ""broken females."" To me, though, these are basic life skills that many men never learn. But they are still useful skills.

I apologize if I've got you wrong when it comes to your worries about being treated like a broken female. Like I said, I'm not sure exactly how to interpret that comment. Anyway, my own experiences with therapy have been really good and I would recommend it to everybody."
mentalhealth,fqb4dyb,t3_ghur8i,1589230379.0,"Hey, I'm sorry life is so tough right now. What I'm hearing from you is that even before the pandemic you were under a lot of pressure to succeed, plus you didn't feel like you had any special aptitude for the things you've been learning. Now that the pandemic is here, things have only gotten more intense, and you're expected to accomplish as much or more than before but with drastically less help. Your home life is not especially supportive either. Today, thinking about your future and how much hinges on your academic success, you feel overwhelmed to the point where you've lost a lot of your hope. Do I have that right?

Unfortunately, I think a lot does hinge on which school you end up in and so on. I can't tell you it doesn't matter. But I have some other things to say that might help ease the pressure that's overwhelming you. First of all, I think a lot of schools are going to take into account how stressful and chaotic this time has been. You are far from the only student whose nerves have been wrecked by doing school from home. I have a feeling universities might not even look at Grade 12 marks when they make their decisions. I wish I could say that's definitely true, but anyway it's a possibility you should take to heart.

Second, I think practicing easing up on perfectionism will help. We often get caught up in this mindset that only perfection will do -- sadly something many schools encourage. We get stuck in all-or-nothing thinking. This perfectionism can stretch from ""if I can't do this assignment right I'm doomed"" all the way up to ""if I can't get into a top-ranked university I'm doomed."" Besides being painful, this way of thinking also stops us from achieving things. This is why people say that perfect is the enemy of good. 

Instead of focusing on the outcome, try to focus on your activities. Are you still doing school work every day? How much time do you spend on it? Is your mind focused or bogged down? Focus on the actions that will bring you success, not the outcome. Reward yourself for getting these actions right, regardless of how close you are to achieving what you ""should"" be.

Finally, I just want to say something about mental states. You put in your post that you think they should come before everything. The problem with that is that if you're vulnerable to depression or other mood disorders (which you might be), moods can be very hard to manage. You can end up putting yourself in a position where you're ruining your life by not feeling good. That's a pretty tough place to be.

My advice is to focus on things that feel meaningful and rewarding in a broad sense. These are probably going to be the same things you were thinking of anyway when you said you put your mental states first. It's just that we can see them in a different light -- not a way of making you happy, but a way of making you feel fulfilled. I'm not sure if this connects with what you're concerned about, but I wanted to talk about it because I ended up feeling pretty bad when I made good mental states my goal in life.

Hopefully some of this is helpful. I know it's so hard to be in your last year of school while all this is happening. I hope you don't feel like the only one dealing with this, because tons of high schoolers are, from the ones who were doing great before the pandemic to the ones who were only hanging on by a thread. Just stick with yourself and be kind to yourself, and you're going to come out of this okay."
mentalhealth,fq8ineo,t3_ghe7uc,1589167073.0,"Hey. This sounds really tough. I'm sorry things have been so painful for you. You say that other people have had it worse, and I guess that's true, but what happened to you is pretty brutal in its way. You really deserved to have a loving and safe home growing up, and also to get real help when you reach out to a therapist. I'm sorry it hasn't been that way.

It's a good sign that you don't want to die anymore. I don't want you to die either. Actually I was in a similar situation where I wasn't suicidal anymore but I had no will to go on either. I think all things considered it's not a bad place to be. It gives us a lot to build on.

One thing that helped for me was imagining my future as if it was someone else. What would someone enjoy about life -- not anyone in particular, but someone? It helped me think about these problems without getting caught up in questions of me. And once I was used to thinking about these things, it was easier to go one step further and start thinking about me.

Well, I hope that helps. Life can be terrible, and for years, but there's always a new day. Reaching out on reddit today was a good step. I'm rooting for you :)"
mentalhealth,fq8glbn,t3_ghbfwm,1589165725.0,"That happens to me too. I think it's because I'm trying to imagine a way that I can escape from a dangerous situation. But then I worry what if it doesn't work, and I have to imagine how I would get out of an even worse situation, and so on. It can really ruin my mood if this goes on.

The only thing I've found that works (and it doesn't work all the time) is trying to figure out why I'm afraid something dangerous will happen. Usually there was something that happened to scare me, even if it's irrelevant to what I'm imagining. For example, someone gives me a dirty look, and then later I'm imagining what I would do if I slipped in the shower. When I can feel less scared of the first thing, then I stop worrying as much about the other things. It's not at all a silver bullet but it helps sometimes."
mentalhealth,fq8g2kl,t3_ghbuzb,1589165394.0,"Hey, this is so horrible. I'm sorry everyone left you hanging after something so terrible happened to you. What happened to you really should have been taken seriously.

I think it's a good idea to follow up on what Icantkeepupwith wrote. Getting justice through the law could do a lot for you to feel that you have been respected.

It makes sense that being sexually abused multiple times would make you a social wreck. Even though you feel dead inside, though, don't give up on yourself. Therapy can heal the wounds inside. The future isn't the same as the past, and ten years from now when you're explaining your life to someone you love, it might not even occur to you to talk about the horrible things that have happened. Not because you're ashamed or trying to hide them, but because your present life ten years from now can be explained by talking about your hopes and dreams, not just by talking about your wounds. 

Again, I'm sorry it's been so bad. You deserved a lot more."
mentalhealth,fpl81c6,t3_ge0dbh,1588708005.0,"Hey, I'm sorry to hear you had it so rough. Everyone deserves to be loved for who they are.

First of all, I think you should drop the label ""annoying."" Because the only way we know if we're annoying is when people react to us like we're doing something wrong. And the reactions you're using to figure this out are all from middle schoolers and high schoolers. You don't have to be actually annoying to be treated as a burden by these people. ""The nail that sticks up gets hammered down,"" as the Japanese saying has it, and that's what it's like at school for most people. 

Now that high school is over for you (right?) you can make friends with people who are on your wavelength. Things that might annoy others about you might be things they like about you. 

On the other hand, it's good to think about how our behaviour results from any traumas we've experienced. You wrote in this post that you were clingy because people were always rejecting you. To me, that doesn't say ""annoying."" My heart goes out to the kids who are so afraid of being left alone because they're mistreated by their classmates. Anyway, it's true that being ""clingy"" can be a result of this kind of traumatic experience. Like I said, to me that doesn't say ""annoying,"" but it can cause some social friction. If you go into therapy and try to heal some of these hurts, it can make social interactions go more smoothly.

As far as I'm concerned, asking you to withhold your natural and spontaneous reactions to life just to please others is asking way too much. You deserve to connect to people as yourself. I know after being hurt so badly for being natural and spontaneous before, it can be so hard to go back to it. But it's so worth it, and I'm sure you'll find some friends who will appreciate you for being you. If not in your town, at least over the internet.

If I'm being really gung-ho, it's because I had a very similar experience. After I left high school I decided never to let people see who I really am. But the results of living that way are so painful. It's much better to connect to people as yourself, even if you might annoy some people."
mentalhealth,fpl71z5,t1_fpl3s9a,1588707512.0,"Yeah, hang in there :)"
mentalhealth,fpl4axz,t3_ge0inr,1588706117.0,"This is really common for people who were treated a certain way as kids. If you were punished a lot for things that weren't actually a big deal, or punished unpredictably, you become very vigilant about figuring out what you did wrong. It's part of you trying to make sure you don't get hurt. But in the end, it hurts a lot, right? It's only helpful when you're in that chaotic and scary situation as a child.

It will help if you try to create a ""Character"" for these intrusive thoughts and feelings. Try to imagine what kind of person they are. I have a feeling the character will come out something like a terrified child who is grimly determined to make sure nothing bad happens again. When you start to get these, think of them as coming from this child, and try not to think of them as ""yours."" I mean, obviously they're yours on one level. But doing this helps you feel less personally involved. This is what part of you learned to do to survive, it isn't anything more than that.

Then, you can even ask this child character what they want and need. ""Okay,"" you can say, ""I hear that you're really worried about that mistake we made back there. What can I do to help?"" Then it might say, ""Make sure nobody noticed, and be perfect forever!"" Then you'll have to say, ""That's not possible. But maybe you will feel safer if I ask my friend about whether it bothered them when I did that."" And you can basically go on like this, treating this part of you like a kid (because in a way it's trapped in childhood).

Okay, I don't know if you'll find this helpful or not. But this is what I learned from my therapist and it worked wonders for me. Hopefully it can be some use to you too. Either way, I hope things turn out well for you. It sucks to be tormented like that."
mentalhealth,fpl2y0w,t3_gdnwok,1588705434.0,"I thought about this a lot while I was depressed and studying philosophy at university. I've come to believe that life isn't meaningless. Basically, our perception of life's moments can range from really meaningful to empty and hollow. The main existentialist move is to trust in the empty and hollow moments as the key ones that reveal how things really are. But, after giving it a lot of consideration, I don't see why we have to pick the empty moments as the trustworthy ones. It's a bit arbitrary.

So now I believe that the meaningful moments are trustworthy. When things feel really meaningful to me, they don't need any extra justification. Just last night I was feeling really peaceful. When I feel that way, everything seems so appropriate. Even the folds in my clothes, the particular shadows on the wall, the dust motes in the air. It didn't need something ""extra"" to give it a purpose to exist. I've come to believe that every moment in life is like this, even though most of the time I'm too uptight to see it.

I think your post shows that you're looking for some kind of purpose outside of yourself. That you have to do something extra in order to justify your existence. That's a huge burden on you. Whether there is something called a life's purpose or not, it won't be something bestowed on you from outside because you jumped through the right hoops. It will be something that is part and parcel with who you are. 

One of the effects of depression is to take away our sense of purpose and our sense that things matter. As you heal, it will come back. I encourage you to ponder which perspective is truer, but also not to stop healing because of it. Don't get stuck in ""paralysis by analysis,"" as Nietzsche called it, and stop moving forward in order to think things through. We can always keep living and healing even as we think about what it all means."
mentalhealth,fpl03gq,t3_ge2y83,1588704022.0,"I've had very similar experiences. I feel like there are two distinct problems that come together here. 1) part of you is really sensitive while ""you yourself"" aren't, and 2) you don't have a way to express these feelings.

I did a kind of therapy that thinks of the mind as divided up into different ""parts."" Our different parts are carrying different kinds of trauma. So when one part of you is feeling really sensitive, that's because it is just more vulnerable than the rest of you. It has certain traumas that ""you yourself"" don't carry around with you. This situation is called dissociation -- when you say your dissociation is over, is it possible you mean derealization or depersonalization?

Dissociation is when this part goes from being ""cut off,"" maybe numb or otherwise inaccessible, to overwhelming you, without ever finding an in-between. To integrate it back into your personality you need to get it into the middle ground, where you can feel what it feels without losing your sense of yourself.

That brings us to the second question, about expressing feelings. It's really hard to express feelings when you aren't feeling connected to your body. Try doing a body scan to get in contact with your feelings -- put your attention to each part of your body and pay attention to how it feels there. You can start with something easy like feeling the soles of your feet. To get to the hard feelings, try focusing on how your gut feels, or your face, or your shoulders. These places hold a lot of our feelings. As the muscles relax, they will try to do something -- like you might want to punch something, or curl up and hide. Whatever this is, try to do it slowly. The more slowly you do it, the more you will connect to the underlying feeling and find it easier to cry.

Well, I hope this helps. I know it's so hard to be in the situation you're in now."

mentalhealth,fpht32c,t3_gdk41g,1588627302.0,"Hey, I'm sorry everything is so hard. Whether or not you have bipolar, it sounds like you're in pain. 

All the things you describe don't NECESSARILY add up to bipolar. Lashing out when you get upset, mood swings, and so on, come with MANY different mental health issues. It could be bipolar, it could be just depression and anxiety, or there could be something else going on too.

If you do have bipolar, medication can be really effective. (It is comparatively less effective for depression and anxiety, although it can also help with those problems). So if it turns out you do have bipolar, I hope you will consider meds.

Therapy is the really big thing though. Therapists can help a lot with depression and anxiety, and a therapist can usually also help you figure out if you have other issues like bipolar. I'm sorry you can't see a therapist right now because of your mom, but please keep it at the top of your list.

It can be very stressful trying to get a therapist when you're a teenager, especially if you don't have support from your parents. But believe me, it pays off. Medication can also help. 

I think this kind of thing (delusions) respond well to medication. I put my emphasis on therapy though because a therapist can help you navigate through the medication part of it too. If it's easier to see a psychiatrist (who can prescribe medication) than it is to see a therapist though, don't hesitate to see the psychiatrist first.

Does this sound doable?"
mentalhealth,fphqmt1,t3_gdgno3,1588626016.0,"I'm sorry you're in this situation. I know what it's like to carry around toxic levels of shame, and it can be so overwhelming that I felt like I was drowning. I feel saddened to think you're dealing with the same kind of experience.

One thing I realized is that there are two kinds of shame: the good kind and the bad kind.

The good kind of shame is like remorse. At bottom, it means having respect for other people's dignity. We feel shame because we think people ought to be treated properly. Confucius said that shame like this is like courage. It dares you to do the right thing.

On the other hard, we can have a toxic kind of shame. This is the shame that doesn't make us more courageous, but only makes us want to crawl under a rock and die. It isn't constructive. Also, in my own experience, I found it to be kind of ""fake."" What I found was that it was kind of a knee-jerk response to fear. When I was afraid that I would be punished, I would start to feel shame. I think it's like a survival mechanism to make the punishment lighter.

Another way of putting the difference is that the first kind of shame recognizes that you have as much dignity and worthiness as the people you hurt. The second kind sees you as a problem, as completely undeserving.

So when you get intrusive thoughts or flashbacks, you can say something like this: ""If I've really done something wrong, I can be brave and try to make it better/ try not to repeat it. The toxic shame that just makes me feel horrible actually stops me from doing that. So, exactly because I did something wrong, I have to reject this toxic shame.""

Of course getting rid of intrusive thoughts and flashbacks is another problem entirely. I have some advice for that too but I thought I would save it since this post is so long. If you're curious though, just let me know.

Good luck with everything. You deserve to feel safe, happy, and untormented, no matter what you've done in the past."
mentalhealth,fphp3cr,t1_fphnryw,1588625210.0,"Actually, the job thing was a huge part of it for me. I had to leave behind all customer service jobs and get a job where I was respected by the people I saw everyday. Then, I had to start doing that job part time. Whenever I worked full time I had to literally force myself to go. I realized that was really hurting my mental health, no matter how much I financially needed it. My hope is that when I'm feeling better I can work full time again, but it's also possible I may just not be able to do that. (Mental health is a legit disability).

So maybe OP should seriously consider leaving their job. But I definitely know I went miserable from one job to the next without much change. I had to do therapy first before changing jobs helped. On the other hand, there are some jobs are just literally so bad. It would be great if OP could talk this over with a therapist."
mentalhealth,fphnh1k,t3_gdhrz1,1588624384.0,"In my experience, something like this is not really about the relationship in question only. It's just as much about your own past, and your own relationship to your parents.

Without knowing your story, I don't know what your past trauma might be. But it sounds like your relationship with your parents may have left you very sensitive to abandonment, feeling responsible for other people's feelings, or maybe with a sense of powerlessness.

This stuff is related to ""attachment theory,"" which is one of the best-supported theories in psychology. Each of us grows up with different ""attachment styles"" that affect how we relate to others. Maybe look at this test and try to see which attachment style sounds like you: [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/tests/relationships/relationship-attachment-style-test](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/tests/relationships/relationship-attachment-style-test)

There are lots of other kinds of trauma that could be involved. I really do think that your experience with T triggered past trauma, though. Otherwise it's hard to understand how strongly it affected you then. That triggering could have retraumatized you, and what you are experiencing now might be triggers for both childhood trauma AND the bad experience with T.

I hope this helps. I know how confusing and painful these triggers can be."
mentalhealth,fphlrsg,t3_gdiks2,1588623520.0,"I think all abuse includes a certain amount of gaslighting. You don't necessarily have to search hard to find it though.

mentalhealth,fphl1jn,t3_gdgag9,1588623150.0,"I was super depressed for many years and I felt this way. Other people being happy just seemed like a bizarre joke. I thought there must be something fake or at least stupid about their happiness. But in the past year I've found a different footing in life.

I heard that ""fight or flight"" responses stop us from getting dopamine. Dopamine makes us feel good, but apparently it also helps us feel like things are meaningful. I'm no neurobiologist, but anyway it felt like the dopamine tap got turned on again. Suddenly it was like, why wouldn't people enjoy life? All the little bits of it are so fun, and also feel meaningful.

What got me to this point was therapy. Specifically my therapist helped me work through the panic in my body. If you're curious about that try watching this video: [https://youtu.be/MmKfzbHzm\_s](https://youtu.be/MmKfzbHzm_s)

I'm sorry things are so desperate right now. I wish I had something more powerful to offer you. Anyways, good luck with everything."
mentalhealth,fp4bggt,t3_gb851v,1588295523.0,"Yeah, what you're saying resonates with my experience. I used to be just paralyzed with social anxiety. I was 100% a different person. But because of therapy I've become much more socially comfortable. And there are a lot of parts of personality that have come out too. However, I think you're right that there will always be a part of you that only comes out when you're alone. 

In my case, my social anxiety was about trauma. Traumatic experiences I had in my past. I think that's true for most anxiety. We get punished for being carefree and showing ourselves, so we learn to hide it. That's something therapy can really heal for us.

I just want to add that even though you don't feel like yourself around others, that doesn't mean you're fake. You're just not completely yourself right now. You can still be a good friend while you're anxious, although of course it's harder.

Anyway, I hope this helps. Good luck with everything :)"
mentalhealth,fp49ibp,t3_gb6u6p,1588294387.0,"I'm sorry you were treated that way growing up. It makes me angry hearing about that -- you didn't deserve that. I can see why it would leave you with problems loving people.

But realize you've got that problem is half the battle. Actually there is a lot of research on ""attachment."" Have you heard of attachment styles? When we are raised a certain way, we learn to relate to people a certain way. Feeling unable to love can be a side-affect of childhood abuse and neglect. Maybe try watching this video (it's an hour long, but even the first few minutes are informative): [https://youtu.be/bGr3lRJ7G6k](https://youtu.be/bGr3lRJ7G6k)

Your low opinion of yourself is also a common side-effect. When we're abused or neglected as kids, it's so much easier to believe that there is something wrong with us. It's so much harder to believe we are being cruelly hurt for no reason. It's a way of making sense out of the chaos.

I really believe you can learn to love again. You can start to see your own dignity and worthiness. Therapy can help so much. Also, educating yourself on trauma and its effects. There's no magic potion to make it go away, but huge numbers of people go through things just as bad as you have, and come out okay, because they had therapy.

Anyway, I'm rooting for you. Life can be so hard, but we can still come out okay. You're wounded, but not damaged, and wounds can always heal."
mentalhealth,fp46sn1,t3_gaffmw,1588292827.0,"When you say me/us, I'm wondering if you have Dissociative Identity Disorder. From what I've read, our different identities split apart when we get really traumatized. So it would make sense that one part of you is angrier than the other part. The kind of therapy I did treats everyone as if they have different ""parts"" of themselves. 

I'm not sure what else to say. I think therapy would be helpful. My therapist likes this thinker, and so I'll link her website: janinafisher.com"
mentalhealth,fp42ngc,t1_fp40gsz,1588290481.0,"Yeah, I'm sorry you were in this tough situation. You don't need to apologize for any of it. I'm wishing you and your friend good luck and safety :)"
mentalhealth,foz8jgg,t3_ga0jps,1588186466.0,"The kind of therapy I did really helped me with something similar. It's based on a specific theoretical model, which I want to explain. The thinker my therapist got it from is Janina Fisher (janinafisher.com) . 

Basically, as our brain develops, we develop different ""parts"" of our personality. With someone who is growing up untraumatized, these different parts sync up so fluidly that they just feel like one person. But when we experience trauma, it's a particular part of us that becomes traumatized. Then our parts don't sync up very well. At the furthest extent, this can become Dissociative Identity Disorder, where the different parts feel like different personalities. But for most of us we just experience contrary desires and fears. One part of us craves intimacy, but another part can't bear it. One part is heartbroken that we aren't accomplishing our dreams, and another part is furious that we even thought about leaving our safe zone. Etc.

This kind of framework I think helps to explain why you have this weird back-and-forth thing going on. Part of you is really healed and has a positive consciousness. But other parts are still suffering. They can get you with intrusive thoughts, or by flooding you with feelings. You can't heal them by healing ""you."" You have to target them directly.

How? Well, first of all, you need to get them into a safe middle-ground. Instead of being gone, or numb, and then coming back with a vengeance, we want to be able to feel what they feel without become overwhelmed by it. One thing we can do is, when we get upset, say ""Oh, it looks like part of me is feeling really angry right now"" (or sad, afraid, hurt, what have you). ""What can I do to help you? What do you need?""

Once you get to a place where these parts are in the middle ground, you can mirror their feelings back to them. You can act like a loving parent with them. When they feel angry, you can feel it too in a sympathetic way, like if your friend was angry. By sympathetically mirroring them, you help heal them from the trauma. You also ""sync"" them up with yourself too, integrating your personality together.

There's another puzzle piece involved -- the body. To get this part into the safe middle-ground, you have to try to be with your body and heal the pain in your body. This video is very helpful on that count: [https://youtu.be/MmKfzbHzm\_s](https://youtu.be/MmKfzbHzm_s)

Well, this has been a long and somewhat exhaustive post. I hope you find it helpful though. It worked for me when I was dealing with something similar."
mentalhealth,foz6dou,t3_ga64or,1588185442.0,"Well, I've never heard of ""emotional incest"" before, but I feel like this idea is a little bit whack? Let me explain why I think so.

There are so many different kinds of relationships than the ordinary one of two parents who are mutually very supportive and have an equally loving relationship with their children. This ""ordinary"" kind of family isn't really that common I think. So even if there's something dysfunctional about the way your family works, it seems to random to me to label it something outrageous like ""emotional incest"" and act like it's a big deal. 

That said, what you're talking about definitely sounds dysfunctional. It seems like your father does rely on you to be an emotional partner in a way that isn't fair to you. I'm especially disturbed that he doesn't want to recognize your body as your own. 

However, the comments about your body aren't necessarily anything to worry about. When you take care of someone from when they're in diapers, you get a sense of familiarity with their body that might be out of place with other people. I don't think it shows anything secretly incestuous. Nor do I think his comment that your body isn't your own shows that either. It shows that he wants to control your behaviour, but not anything incestuous.

It seems like the main thing here is just that your father places huge emotional demands on you. He doesn't give you the kind of emotional space you need, and he seems to depend on your support. That's a lot to deal with from such a young age. So you don't need to tell him anything about ""emotional incest,"" but you can definitely say things like ""I feel like you have such high expectations of how I'm going to support and be there for you. I love you and want to support you, but I need the space to have my own life too. I also need you to accept that I'll have boyfriends and my own relationships. That's a wonderful part of life I don't want to miss out on.""

Also, I know I said that all those things you listed aren't really ""emotional incest,"" but if any one of them makes you uncomfortable, you have a right to set a boundary there. If you don't appreciate comments about your body from your father, you can let him know. You shouldn't have to put up with anything like that if it makes you uncomfortable.

I hope this helps. Relationships with parents can be very messy, especially because parents have a hard time recognizing when we have grown up and changed. I hope everything works out with you and your dad :)"

In a way, we should see what's happened to you as a disability. It might be due to mental health, it might be developmental, it could be lots of things. But it's just one more obstacle. It doesn't reflect badly on you. Would you blame someone without legs for not finishing a race?

I never did EMDR but something similar really helped me. Basically using techniques like in that link I sent you in the previous post. By feeling the feelings in my body, letting them come up, and working through them, I noticed that the muscles in my eyes changed and I saw the world differently. 

Maybe talk to your therapist about other kinds of ""somatic experiencing"" (that's what van der Kolk is talking about) and ""Internal family systems theory."" Those were basically the two things that got me from my hardest place to where I am now. Also, there is a particular kind of family systems theory that helped me, from Janina Fisher ([https://janinafisher.com](https://janinafisher.com)). My therapist learned a lot from her and that's what helped me.

mentalhealth,fowqlbm,t1_fownxgl,1588125069.0,"Well, based on what you've written in the edit, I think it's a nuanced situation. 

I think you were showing controlling behaviour. Being controlling isn't just about letting someone do what they want, it's also about letting them do it without judgment. Trying to be the good angel on her shoulder and always telling her what she *should* be doing can be very stifling. To treat people properly, we have to let them do things their way. 

Now, when I say it's nuanced, it's because I wonder if she put you in this position at all. It could be that she wanted someone to baby her and look after her, but then the moment it got too much, she wanted to blow you off. In a way, she might have been looking for the kind of parent she didn't have when she was a teenager. Someone who could worry about her all the time and she could rebel against.

The example of her staying out and not telling you is also nuanced. If you had good reason to believe she might be hurt or unsafe, then of course you will want to make sure she's okay. She put you in that position by not communicating with you. I don't think it's too much to ask of her that she let you know that she's safe.

So, all things considered, I think this is a normal dysfunctional (or codependent) relationship. She wanted you to take care of her and also to give her space. You wanted someone to take care of but perhaps resented having to be the ""bad guy"" all the time. It doesn't mean you're a full-blown abuser, or that you're more to blame for things going wrong than she is, but it also means that you aren't any less to blame than she is.

Well, that's how I see it. You mentioned about seeking approval from random strangers on the internet -- I'm sorry if my lack of approval is messing with you. I want you to be happy and safe. I also feel compelled to give an honest assessment of the facts you're telling me, but mostly I just want you to be happy and safe."

changemyview,fowoksq,t3_g9wdr6,1588123916.0,"Well, there are so many factors involved in this judgment. It isn't just about the differences between democracy and benevolent dictatorship; it's also about what aspects of a society are more worth valuing. For example, are we concerned here with maximizing the benefits of society as a whole, or of minimizing the harms to certain individuals? I think there's a case that a benevolent dictator could maximize the benefits to society as a whole, but part of that bargain is that you personally might get shafted and not have any way of dealing with it. Sometimes things are running so smoothly that they run right over you.

By contrast, liberal democracies are much better at minimizing the chance that you will be harmed. They have two mechanisms for this. The first and most obvious one is voting. Unlike in a benevolent dictatorship, you always have the ability to kick someone out of office. The second mechanism is a constitution that lays out rights and freedoms. It means that the majority can't simply get their way no matter what. This is why minorities like queer people have been so safe in liberal democracies compared to benevolent dictatorships.

I also want to add that the rowdiness of liberal democracies is a great information-delivery system. Because people start hollering when the system starts to run over them, people are so much more aware of what's going on throughout society. Of course there are always groups whose voices get buried by the media and so on, but taken as a whole it is an efficient way of getting information.

For a benevolent dictatorship, people aren't rewarded for being rowdy, making a fuss, and insisting that they get their way. So there are huge problems that can go unreported for years, just because nobody in power wants to hear about it. This was one problem with the early outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan. The officials in charge didn't want to let anyone know about the problem, probably because they hoped they could resolve it in silence before their superiors would find out. In the end, it has made an enormous difference for the whole world. (If anyone disagrees with my version of events, I am not particularly interested in arguing about it).

So, in spite of the many flaws in democracy that you mention, I still think it's a safer bet. In fact, some of its flaws are just the flip-side of its virtues. You have to put up with the chaotic, manipulable, stop-and-start business of democracy in order to get the benefits of minimizing harm to individuals and keeping acutely in touch with emerging problems."

mentalhealth,fowkbaw,t3_g9rwmh,1588121454.0,"I'm sorry you're going through this. It sounds really tough.

When it comes to having a mental fog, so many factors could be involved. I don't want to close off any of those possible factors. But based on what you say about naps and things like that, it sounds like you might be just living in a state of perpetual crisis. 

Fear makes us stupid and clouds our mind. That's well known. With you, it sounds like you are living in a state of perpetual fear so intense that you can't think straight. When you're able to really relax and your nervous system changes gears, you can think normally. When the fear comes back though, so does the fog. Does that sound right?

If that's true, meds can't change it. You need to learn to calm down your nervous system. That requires changes across the board. Do you have a therapist? This is something that's better to do along with a therapist. It means training your mind not to see everything as a threat. It means directly working with your body/nervous system to reset everything (see this video [https://youtu.be/MmKfzbHzm\_s](https://youtu.be/MmKfzbHzm_s)). It also means going over your past to figure out what traumatic experiences have given you so much fear.

Like I said, this could be just one factor among many. And I could be wrong about it too. I'm talking about this based on experience, so it definitely happens this way for some people, but it might not be what's going on with you. Anyway, I hope this is helpful."
mentalhealth,fowjcf6,t3_g9s8by,1588120910.0,"I'm sorry you're going through so much. This sounds painful and confusing. I have some thoughts that might help you.

It's common for people with certain problems to go back and forth between being overconfident and insecure. The overconfidence is there to hide the insecurity, and so it has to be exaggerated. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Just remind yourself that you are always really somewhere in the middle. Your opinions aren't so much more important than anyone else's, but they do matter. 

With your father, I think the best approach is to assume that he is abusive. It's true that it could be in your head, there are things that happen to us that can distort our perspectives. But right now you are locked into a house with him. You can't afford to walk directly into the abuse, telling yourself that you could be wrong about it. Later, you can sort out what's going on.

It sounds like your relationship to your girlfriend was kind of dysfunctional. I believe you that she was spinning out of control and hurting herself. But you can't be the one to change that for her.  It's just the way it that you can't help people who don't want to help themselves. Many have tried, and it just doesn't work. By trying to do that, I think you were being controlling. We have to let people choose their fate, even when they choose wrong.

All in all, it sounds like you have had some traumatic childhood experiences. A traumatic experience is where you feel like your life is being threatened and you are powerless to do anything about it. Trauma leaves a mark on you and changes you in the future. But it can be changed. Revisiting the memories with a therapist can be really useful. It's also good to connect to these feelings in your body. There's a good video about this from a leading researcher: [https://youtu.be/MmKfzbHzm\_s](https://youtu.be/MmKfzbHzm_s)

I know what it's like to feel like you have to escape but have nowhere to go. Just do what you have to do to survive. You don't have to be a champion, just try to make it to seeing the therapist (I hope that email is on its way) and then take it one day at a time."
