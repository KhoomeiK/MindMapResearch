I contacted 4 places in my area that accepted my insurance, who online said they were accepting new patients. Each place told me they were fully booked until mid February. Each response made me feel worse and worse. I am doing better now and was finally able to see someone but there was no way I was going to be able to wait 3 months for just an initial visit."
