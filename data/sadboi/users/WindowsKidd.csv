Also there is one other matter. Between the months of mid-October to early January this year, he literally moved out. Admittedly I had a low-payment because I don’t technically have a room, so I took his room when he moved out. I took the higher payment when he was gone. He moved back in unexpectedly, and within a few weeks said he wants ‘his room’ back because it’s ‘his house’, and it was ‘non-negotiable’. He also took the higher payment again. I asked a reliable family member and they said I should give him the room back to avoid issues. 

Does that moving out actually count for anything? He just paid to store equipment at the house while he moved out. I wasn’t thinking, and I just paid him the rent which he paid the landlord or whatever. Obviously I didn’t anticipate this kind of a mess.

Thanks for listening. I am kinda worried.... if he decides to write down 30 days notice, what do I do? Also I have accounts I’ve friends about his behavior, I’ve recorded him in his rage, I’ve vented about it online. Do any of those help? Am I overthinking things?
