nursing,fk16yd2,t3_ffoaul,1583773652.0,At the hospital I work at we rotate who is charge (any nurse is eligible as long as they‚Äôre at least 6 months in) and all it means is you direct all the calls the unit receives and you control the bed planning. You still carry the same amount of patients. How is it different at other hospitals?
