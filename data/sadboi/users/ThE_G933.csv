unpopularopinion,fqlp2f5,t1_fqlfjun,1589463294.0,"Investing a lot into someone is indeed beautiful, especially when that someone appreciates and returns your investment at least as equally. This is one way of knowing if you've found your soulmate.

Also, I believe that your soulmate is someone with whom you can speak and interact with as if you are interacting with yourself. And by this I mean being free to make mistakes, to laugh, to make a fool out of yourself, to talk and open up to them in a way that you can learn more about yourself just by the fact that they are listening. And they LISTEN. Without judgement. They listen to help YOU improve. You improving is them being happy. This goes both ways of course. These are a few things at the top of my head for what I believe characterizes a soulmate. Someone who sacrifices for you (and you for them) and who cares so deeply about your happiness as if it were their own.

Someone whom merely thinking about brings you peace and joy.The most beautiful creation in your life. You will feel all these things click in an instant with a soulmate, and others obviously need some time to build and develop together.

I know this because I once had someone like that, but I made terrible mistakes and ended up losing them.I still think of her as my greatest teacher because, through these mistakes that I made with her, I learned A LOT about myself and how to become a better person. Ironically, our separation set me on the path to becoming the best version of myself which I know she would be proud of, even though we are total strangers at this point.

Just the thought that she would be happy and proud with my progress, makes me happy and encourages me to keep going forward. Even if I don't get to share it with her.

This, my friend, is a soulmate."

religion,foqd3zh,t1_fophpsk,1587990578.0,"Have you (or other Muslims) ever pondered the notion that Allah might not actually be a real figure but instead an Ideal representing the highest moral good which every human should aim for? That by 'worshipping' Allah, it doesn't necessarily have to be submitting ourselves before an all-powerful deity, but rather, a confession of our humility and the recognition that there is something much greater than ourselves? This something might be God, but what I'm saying is that it might be more abstract and that 'God' or 'Allah' is a term to try to make this 'something' more tangible.

I would really appreciate some answers. I'm not coming from any place of hate or doubt. I'm just a curious Muslim. Thank you!"

Semenretention,fn372ys,t1_fn0wn23,1586614442.0,"Are you into the arts? If you are, and it could be anything really, whenever you get into that creative flow state, you feel strong pleasurable vibrations rushing throughout your body. 

When you are in a state of meditation and envision your dreams or desires, you also get this same feeling of energy moving in your body. It's intense and discernible. 

You could also be feeling randomly happy or blissful for some moments of the day, and you would get the exact same rush. Me personally I find them most common when I've finished a workout and listening to music afterwards. Music puts me in this flow state. So I would say just about anything that puts you in your flow state will let you experience this energy.  
Exercise is also crucial in not only providing access to this vibrational state but also as something to pair with SR.

I feel these way often when on SR. It takes maybe a few weeks to start feeling them. SR is not a condition for you to be feeling these, but it definitely intensifies, purifies, and strengthens them and allows them to happen way more frequently and they feel much better."

lawofattraction,fgfnwyi,t1_fgepg9u,1580743613.0,"Hey brother first I would say is to take a deep breath and clear your mind for just a moment. I totally understand how you're feeling and I know how helpless and desperate you feel. I want you to know that it's okay to feel this way sometimes we are only human and when we love or want someone who maybe isn't showing same feelings back, we tend to close off or spiral into despair.

And that's okay. This doesn't mean you have no chance of seeing her or going out with her.  
In fact, I'd say you will definitely see her again. I am not saying that to falsely ""reassure"" you or anything like that, no. Dude, I've been in a much worse situation than you and still I managed to manifest her.

You can do it. My advice is to give it some time, stop trying to control her thoughts or feelings for you, stop trying to force any conversation when she doesn't want to, stop trying to act as if you have total control or power over everything as by doing this you will only push her away more.

What I would do instead is let it go for now, give it time (and don't worry about the length of time, always remind yourself to get back in the present moment, try not to think in terms of weeks or months as these durations are only in your mind and will create nothing but stress and anxiety; time will pass anyway, there is nothing but the present moment), focus on yourself and focus on implementing the habits which I listed for other users here. 

And before you know it, you are there with her looking at her beautiful smile and enjoying her company and warmth and enjoying the feeling that she is now next to you because of everything that you did. You will feel proud, grateful, and complete.

Trust me man, if she isn't showing any signs of cooperation, let it go, do the things I've talked about, and before you know it, you're with her again. Don't lose hope. Never lose hope. Fear is the worst of vibrations. Always stay occupied with positive vibrations.

DM if you need anything else brother! Much love to you and her"
lawofattraction,fgfmzsw,t1_fge9tb1,1580742986.0,"The feeling is indeed amazing! Thank you so much for your words.

And yes, make sure to read my replies here to the other users on how I did it and how to almost completely eliminate any ""needy"" thoughts and desires. I say almost completely because it is of course impossible (or nearly impossible, unless you're a Buddha) to eliminate all aspects of neediness. We are still human after all and we are blessed and cursed with an Ego which is difficult to control and will run crazy for most of the day. As long as you are aware of this fact however, you can always remind yourself to distinguish between when you are feeling needy and when you are feeling it truly from your heart. You can always notice the ""neediness"" and choose to silence it by doing any of the following: cold showers, exercise, something you love, listening to music that you really love, etc... Anything really that touches your soul and bypasses your ego. When you are in this state of ""soul,"" or, as some people call it, state of flow; now you are ready to feel and attract what it is that you want most.

Let me know if you need anything else and good luck! You can do it"

lawofattraction,fgdppwg,t1_fgcfeoz,1580685169.0,"That's a good point. I've found that it's better not to phrase it in an ""I want to or I will"" manner. Always write it in the simple present and write exactly how you perceive yourself to be feeling with her. Your perception would be strong you will actually feel it in your body as if it's already happening. It's as if you have it. When you are in this state, avoid ""I will and I want"" and write by simply describing how the desire is making you feel right now.

An example I wrote: ""I am looking at you getting into my car and I cannot believe it.""

This is exactly how I would feel when picturing my girl and I would copy those feelings on paper.  


And soon enough, I found myself looking at her 2 nights ago in the club and I couldn't believe it. I was literally stunned for like 10 seconds not believing it. The music disappeared and l lost all my sense of self. After these 10 seconds (during which I had been experiencing some sort of awakening), I approached her calmly and gave her the hug of my life and didn't let go."
