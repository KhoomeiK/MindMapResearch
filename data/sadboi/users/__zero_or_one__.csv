But for me, I just think:

Take n atomic letters in the statement. 

The first atomic letter will be 2^n many Trues in a row, followed by 2^n falses.

The next column will be 2^(n-1) Trues, then 2^(n-1) falses. For the columns past the first, just repeat that pattern until all rows are filled for that letter.

Repeat until last column. 

So for a statement with 3 atomic letters, I just think to myself ""4 T/F, then pairs of 2 T/F, then pairs of 1T/F""

Probably along the same lines of how you do yours, just maybe from a different perspective, and order for labeling."

learnmath,eslrtgy,t3_c88neb,1562090820.0,"I'm not sure about applications in CS, but I learned about Fourier Series from a boundary value problems class. Essentially it was looking to solve partial differential equations. Sometimes you would come to a situation where the solution to a PDE would have to consist of something that does not have a finite amount of terms, such as ""1"", ""cos(x)"", ""3sin(2x)+4cos(5x)"", etc... and instead we would use an infinite series of sine and cosine terms that would then satisfy boundary conditions. As for a video explaination, 3 blue 1 brown is usually what I recomend, so I'll search around to see if I can find something a little more approachable to you.

Edit: as for actual applications, my guess is that you would need to learn FS for signal analysis/processing.
