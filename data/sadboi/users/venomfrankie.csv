Psychosis,fbf5hkv,t3_eczsei,1576802066.0,I took abilify and it made me feel dead. It was so hard to focus and function. Luckily I was in 24/7 care at the time so I got to talk to my psychiatrist fairly fast and I switched to geodon. It was way better but not perfect. It took lotsss of adjusting.

SuicideWatch,evyuo6e,t3_clw3gl,1564941845.0,The person who assaulted me did not get arrested as far as I know
SuicideWatch,evyavpn,t3_clw3gl,1564927874.0,"Part 3: On December 3rd 2018 after being ignored after I said I was writing a suicide note I attempted suicide in what I say was the most violent and scary attempt for me. I was planning on going to school and then sneaking out and running into traffic to get hit by a car,  however there were many many people outside so I quickly devised a plan b. I went into my school's least used bathroom and tried to bite through but mostly cut my skin till I bled out. I only had broken adult scissors but I tried so hard. I sat there for two hours writing a note for a bit but mostly cutting my arms and legs and some of my neck a lot. My body had at least 200 cuts on it. My arms were fucked up. There was more blood then I've ever seen on me so I took a few pictures and I still have them. I cried at the end of the 2 hours when I realized I couldn't bleed out and if I left the bathroom it would be awkward with my arms covered in blood. I tried to call a suicide hotline but before they got to me the school police and nurse and consulars found me. They cleaned my wounds, bandaged them, and got my mom to take me to the mental hospital. But it was a new one. I stayed in that place for fuckin ages in partial and 24/7 until after getting sent back to 24/7 care they decided to send me to residential treatment. Also during this time I fuckin grew to who I am today, got sexually assaulted, got a dog, and yeah. Also somewhere during this story I got a eating disorder which I forgot to mention and was 13 pounds underweight bro. Anyways I went to that resident place and it's like a fuckin prison btw. I swear u could get PTSD just from that fuxkin place. They neglected us? but it was ok sometjmes. Anyway I got out,  graduated 8th grade, lived through the goddamn summer of 2019 and now I'm here on reddit at 9 AM still not having gone to sleep."
SuicideWatch,evy9f0s,t3_clw3gl,1564926694.0,"Part 2: (I hope everyone knows I'm not looking for attention) I started having problems in the summer I was going to middle school, maybe it had to do with my parents divorce but I remember always saying it didn't affect me. My dad was a bit strange after the divorce, he would interrogate me about my mom and he hired a spy to follow her around and the spy even went to a different country with them. My mom would be very paranoid about my dad and she always says he's hacking her but of course my dad Denys it. He likes to gaslight and lie a lot though. I was always a shy and extremely quiet kid but when I got to sixth grade I developed terrible anxiety that made me vomit and stay home from stress. During that time I started hallucinating, visual monsters that looked like horror movie things. I also started self harming but it was very rarely. Eventually somehow in 7th grade shit went crazy. My hallucinations were constant and I always saw them,  they would talk to me and even touch me sometjmes. I was walking down the hall one day and I met this tall older person with a My chemical Romance shirt on and I instantly became friends with them. I don't know how this happened but we ended up getting into a dumb relationship. My memory becomes very foggy and weird when I try to remember this chunk of my life but basically I was verbally and physically abused and my brain still tried to block it out. (I don't even know if I'm adding this part in the right time in the story.)Even just saying their name out loud can put me into a panic. One day someone ended up reporting me for having lots of cuts on my wrist and the police showed up at my house. They took me to a hospital until they could find me a mental hospital. Basically shit happened. I was in their care for months (in and out of 24/7 and just day treatment). I went back to school for a bit but then somehow I went into a homicidal rage and was bringing a knife to school to stab a random kid in a bathroom!?! I was put inpatient twice for homicidal plans/ideation :(. I just had this crave for blood and shit for like 2 months. I have no idea what caused it I just remember being full of anger and I hated religion. Bruh moment right there. I think I went in one more time for suicidal stuff but then I left until one faithful December 2018 day"

In Wicca I've heard moths and butterflies mean transform, like how they change from a caterpillar to whatever."
