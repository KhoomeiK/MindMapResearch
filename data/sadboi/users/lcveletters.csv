Broadway,fpluxlj,t3_ge4a2j,1588719960.0,Good god... The second hand embarrassment I felt...
askgaybros,fpjo3qw,t1_fpjllp1,1588675653.0,"Thank you for this. I envisioned that kinda intimacy and it was nice. So I guess that says something.

Once quarantine ends I think I’ll take your advice."

self,fonpibh,t1_fonoxyu,1587923946.0,I think I’m gonna rephrase it because it’s caused some confusion! I said “I held anger towards my biological mom for a long time.” In the past tense. I came to the same conclusion as you. And i’m sorry you are not able to meet your biological mom!
self,fomihrq,t1_fomhqec,1587891266.0,"I didn’t mean to come off as if I’m judging her. I don’t know her, however when I was a teenager I carried a lot of resentment towards being adopted. I used past tense because since then my views have changed a lot. There’s a lot of unanswered questions I have, and frankly I’m scared of what the answers may be."

SuicideBereavement,fo4ybb9,t1_fo4v62p,1587513618.0,"First and foremost, thank you for sharing your story and I’m sorry you’ve had to go through this too. 

I’ve been thinking a lot recently and have been heavily considering support groups or something of the sort. I’ve always kind of been a “I’ll keep all my emotions right over here, and one day I’ll die.” kinda guy but this account is me starting to change that. 

Once again, thank you for responding. I wish you the best."
Anxiety,fo4k746,t3_g5lc4j,1587505918.0,"Thank you for this post, I may start doing this. I end up just squeezing or clenching my teeth until I implode. 

Proud of you."
self,fnx7e9z,t1_fnx63l2,1587332943.0,I resent calling suicide selfish. Her and I both had struggled with mental health issues for a very long time and I knew that going into it. She was dealt a bad hand in life and I cannot blame her for taking the only way she knew out. Even if it really fucking hurts.
self,fnwqsiy,t1_fnwk048,1587323623.0,Thank you for this.
self,fnwqnrx,t1_fnwp49u,1587323548.0,I’m sorry you’re having to go through this too. You can PM as well if you ever need to vent or anything.
SuicideWatch,fnvh2np,t1_fnvghbu,1587293049.0,"I haven’t, that’s probably a good idea. I’ll do it tomorrow.

What games do you have on xbox?"
SuicideWatch,fnvg0by,t1_fnvfkf2,1587291904.0,"Not much, to be honest. Restarting the console and my router. I was thinking of trying to get an ethernet cable and hooking it up to that."
SuicideWatch,fnvfj1l,t1_fnvf0ns,1587291387.0,"I appreciate it, man. I would love to be your friend. I do have an xbox, but I need to do something with it because every time I try to play I lose connection and I’m not sure why."
