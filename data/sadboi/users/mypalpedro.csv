I've been an outpatient for 16 years now on and off (going from young peoples mental health to adult). I can truly say that with many mental health problems it is an ongoing battle. Some people will never truly overcome. The trauma is there. It will never go. We just have to learn to live/cope with it. Sounds like I'm being dismissive. However I know with the right tools and support life can be more than livable. Enjoyable even.
For me the best advice was to not go to my parents in times of stress, worry or darkness. We always want our parents to be our first responders but sometimes they're just not the right person to help. You can't change a person, but you can change how they make you feel. Again I'm lucky. I have three children who love me unconditionally. As much as they miss their friends, family and routine. Overall they are happy to be spending time with me. I've got to enjoy it while I can.

You couldn't just google how to ""make scrambled eggs"". 
Home economics used to teach you these kind of things, fried egg, soup, backed potato. Simple yet tasty efficient meals. However now and as long ago as when I was at school, we were taught how to make sugar less bran muffins and fish curry.  Many high schools don't have H.E as a subject at all due to teacher shortages. 
With this it's not just a case of change your diet. It's a lifestyle change. When you have been brought up with a microwave cooking many meals, you tend to stick to what you know as an independent adult. Again I only think this is part of the obesity picture.

It isn't always as simple as ""making poor decisions"". Children who live and grow up in poverty ARE vulnerable. They did not decide to be born.

Anyone who needs sanitary products can get them. You dont have to fill in a form or declare your earnings. You literally walk into schools/colleges or doctors surgery and help yourself to a packet.

Our government is trying to shorten the gap between the rich and the poor. Free sanitary items (and so much more) means that our people in vulnerable situations dont have to worry financially about these items that are necessary and not luxury items.

>No but it is undemocratic for the SNP to try and rerun the referendum until they get the answer they want.

SNP ran their campaign on the fact that Scotland should have a choice. The conservatives said vote for us to stop a referendum. The votes show Scotland wants a choice. The circumstances have changed dramatically in less than a decade.
 You say remaining in the EU did not make up a substantial portion of why we voted to remain in the uk. Think of all those born in the uk that thought they'd face deportation just because their parents were born in the eu. Are you going to provide me with tory stats? I heard it from the mouths of teens in 2014. Now in their early twenties; some now parents, who want to stay in their home. Scotland. They are welcome. 

>You're also missing why we needed austerity. In the wake of the economic crash it was the best choice. It meant we did not suffer repeated recessions in the years after (as many of the other big players in the EU did).

The crash was caused because we bailed out the banks. The elite were saved at the cost of the british people. Other countries jailed the bankers involved. We should have done the same. Instead  hard working people have no choice but to go to food banks whilst the elite discuss how they can make money from the nhs and further oppress the poor, vulnerable and disabled."

Scotland,feapcsj,t1_fea764s,1578951030.0,"In my experience primary school education has improved massively since the snp came to power.  Mental health is a main focus. The children are taught mindfulness. They do yoga. They have much smaller class sizes. Making class discussions more inclusive. Growing stronger bonds between the children and the teacher with them. They are taught change is normal and there are those that support them outwith their family. They are taught to embrace their strengths. Whatever they may be. Personally I am  a little jealous of the support my son receives from school in comparison to my own school not half a mile away from his; albeit 20 years ago.
Due to this school leavers are more in tune to their strengths and go into apprenticeships or internships. Or even start their own business. I can recommend a successful 16 year old makeup artist from Aberdeen. In fact I know a 16 year old who left school to become a jockey. Went to public school. Grew up in council housing. 
Why this is important? Everyone should be given a chance to achieve their goals based on their ability not their monetary status. A country is only as strong as their ability to take care of their most vulnerable. The Scottish government give the people a voice. They are not heard by Westminster.

Free books from book bug. Free education. Good opportunities for apprenticeships. Free prescriptions. Help to buy for first time home owners. Free contraception, free sanitary products; the list goes on. What I love the most is; all the snp are doing for kids in care. They are trying to make it easier for kids to stay with their foster families after they are 16. Whether they are in further education, work or not. To round things up the independence family has a varied age range, but  for our bairns we will never stop fighting. For Scotland to have a choice rather than being told what to do by Westminster."
