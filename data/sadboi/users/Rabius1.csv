A short sad story that pretty well sums it up.

I don't know the long story. My comment was in reference to the fact he told that to police. 

The long story just got a little more interesting in my opinion because he was apparently found incompetent to stand trial. I'm very interested to know more about his motive. From his own mouth it was ""to have his story told"""

It's hard being alone. I didn't find myself attractive and wasn't taking any good care of myself so I been working my ass off for 1 year now to really improve and I'm kicking ass. 

Tip: dont wait on the one single noun that is going to improve your life a great deal. Happiness is inside. Just know what you being to the table and try to improve daily.
