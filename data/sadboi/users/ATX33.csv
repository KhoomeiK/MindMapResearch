People are a reflection of what THEY feel inside, it has NOTHING to do with you... it's their emotional turmoil that they are projecting onto you.

It's not you.

People that don't face their own emotional issues will unload that toxicity onto anyone they can get away with... sounds like your dad probably gets really angry when someone cuts him off in traffic... that's not a healthy mind.

Instead of absorbing other people's (faulty) perceptions of you, try learning to understand your own emotions better.

This is why Meditation exists. Self-Inquiry.

You explore your own emotional problems with genuine honesty (just to yourself)... no running from the harsh truth, face it, and then explore why you have those feelings.

Eventually you come to a point where you feel others have wronged you... this is a fact of Life... you need to learn to overcome these experiences, this is Forgiveness. Let go of pride or shame and just try to genuinely forgive others, even if they don't ""deserve"" it... do it anyway.

This is a process of Surrendering.

It's difficult, counter-intuitive, co,fusing to the Ego... but it works.

Doing this self-mastery work is how you grow emotionally... and in time it gives you a bulletproof perception of Life that nobody can take away from you... it's essentially opening your 3rd eye to a much larger perspective of Life.

That perspective is what many people are missing in this curent world... this makes them angry, angsty, depressed, anxious, greedy and selfish... as i'm sure you have experienced.

One talks Enlightenment, the other seeks Enlightenment.

Because of this, religious people tend to be off-limits for spiritual conversation.

Of course, those who have not awakened to the Spiritual nature of existence are simply unable to approach the subject and tend to poo-poo it as a method to save-face.

It seems one of the best approaches for attracting the people who are open-minded (Experienced) in this topic are the Psychonauts.

Psychedelic drugs have been mankinds open door thru the veil since, forever.

My point is, you may begin looking towards events that attract these Spiritually-Aware people.

Burning Man, DisclosureFest, Meditation Retreats, etc.

As well, follow Spiritually inclined artists and musicians to see where they present their work... 

Alex Gray, Olga Klimova, Android Jones, etc

Follow Spiritually inclined philosophers that are recognized...

Terrence McKenna, Alan Watts, Manly P Hall, Actualized.org, etc

And then use these ""leads"" to either find other people to cross paths with in real life... or use these names to test/open conversations with people, without jumping fully into the topic of ""Spirituality"".

If you mention the name ""Alan Watts"" to someone, you can usually see whether they ""get it"" or not based on their reaction... some may know his name, but don't light up when they reply to you... while others will kind of have a spark in their eye (and likely continue the convo with you)... either way, you don't lose face by seeking engagement.

Lastly, check out Meetup.com (app)... there can be everything from ""Spiritual Awakening"" groups to ""Metaphysical Science"" groups... Shamanism meetups, Psychedelic Healing meetups, Existentialism meetups, etc, etc.

You aren't going to find many people on the street who aren't just brainwashed religiosities...  unfortunately that's the status quo... but there are plenty of people out there, they're just forced to live in a Fringe manner as this topic hasn't evolved from the archaic belief systems that have stifled humanity during this kulpa (the end of Kali Yuga).

It's a shame it's not more commonplace, but it's also part of the evolutionary process... so use it to challenge your own growth, as opposed to taking it as a negative.

For example, you must have heard that Hitler and the Nazis had an interest in the Occult, yeah?

The Swaztika was stolen from the Buddhists, it's actually a symbol of Peace (ultimately a representation of the esoteric nature of Life infinitely in motion).

That was the 1940's... the Nazi's stole a prominent Occult symbol from a peaceful spiritual people, then went on to try and kill everyone on the planet that wasn't German... and they almost succeeded.

The best way to learn this is to stop judging, everything.

Just let go of your judgement towards everything that you like/dislike.

You won't become Jesus... but you will learn exactly what you are asking for.

When you stop judging with your heart, you begin to see everything at face value... as opposed to the illusion of perception that you are projecting on everything.

For example, you may get angry at Trump... I just see an angry man that's suffering his role in the cosmic game of Life. I don't get mad about his actions, I just accept that it's all happening and that the world is not in my control. That's humility.

It's also the path to transcending your own Suffering.

Humility is not about bowing down to others outright... we're not here to Worship.

It's about seeing the bigger picture... viewing the world from the higher vantage point, and accepting that it's a game of experience that's entirely in control.

When you begin to gain these realizations, you become naturally humble as you experience just how complex the system is.

We've been leaning into a society for decades now, where it's actually cool to not care... combined with an atrocious level of corporate and political greed, it becomes apparent where that mindset is stemming from.

It's not about starting a fight with any institution or candidate... but simply taking personal stock in giving a shit about something in your immediate sphere of environment.

If you care, you act... if you act, you find those disseminating a negative system on society don't get supported.

I've always liked the phrase ""Vote with Your Wallet""... but I realized it still falls on deaf ears, the societal/capitalist/materialist influence is too strong... people forget.

True action only manifests through Caring about something.

Lao Tzu, Alan Watts, Manly P Hall, Terrence McKenna, Aldous Huxley, Ram Dass, Timothy Leary, Nick Sand (inventor of Orange Sunshine acid)... all these men are saying the same thing Leo at Actualized is saying.

It's a simple premise which YOU can experience yourself... but you have to let go of that fear and accept that you are NOT in control of your Life.

This is difficult for many to accept.

When you do though, you see for yourself... and when you see, you then feel compelled to SHARE this with others.

There are always people who resist the idea... it's literallystaring into the Void... but it's also the most natural state of human existence.

There is a GOOD reason mankinds seemingly bizarre history of Pyramid building, extravagant Temple building, God mythologies and religious dogma have permeated for the entire length of human memory...

awakened,flv18bj,t3_frb0li,1585514276.0,"Besides the esoteric ideology that you are raising your vibration to grow spiritually for the next stages of Life (after death)... it's all about Control.

Learning to control your Mind allows you to transcend the inevitable hardships of the Life experience. 

Being in control of your emotions allows you to take action without reaction.

What that means is, when a Lover eventually pulls out of a relationship with you... do you panic, get angry and lash out at them because you've been hurt? Or do you know to accept the situation at face value, calmly take time alone and contemplate the entire relationship from a place of Conpassion, trying to understand WHY that person no longer wants to be with you?

The whole purpose of Life (imho) is to learn Love... Unconditional Love. The kind of Love that comes with no rewards... just Love for others, because that's the best course of action.

If everyone lived this way, the world would live in harmony as we all take care of each other, FIRST... as opposed to the Selfish/ME-First game we play these days that leads to war and Greed.

There are deep metahysical concepts that explain WHY we should practice these things... but all those ideas (study conparitive religion) are putting a reward on the process... that's not genuine Compassion, when you do it for a payment of some sort in the afterlife.

The simplest way to approach it is this... control your mind (and Body) and you control your Life. Control your Life and you set an example for others to follow. Set that example and watch the world grow into a place of beauty. 

Love leads to Peace.
That's it.

If you choose to take the darker path, which is also valid... you will Suffer a lot more. Living selfishly leads to a hard Life, where even little inconveniences like someone cutting you off in traffic, triggers your anger and makes you miserable.

When you live with that much unrest, the relationship situation mentioned above can lead one to commit horrible acts of revenge, even suicide... as they aren't in control of themselves and the situation forces them to react selfishly, without Compassion or consideration for WHY the other person may be feeling the way they do.

Hope that makes some sense out of it all... but one last thing.

The whole retention/nofap thing... it's meant to be used to learn self-control over your biological body, so you learn to control your Lust and not allow the world to make you do things because your dick said so. üòÑ

Later in practice, you can use retention in Tantra practice for deeper spiritual experience... but since you are young, don't think nofap is a permanent part of Life... go get laid, or beat that shit up if you need to... just learn what you are trying to learn, then be mindful of your lessons when it confronts you in Life.

Love is where you find that. Anything else is a distraction that you allow into your experience to challenge yourself.

As long as you RECOGNIZE that you are ALLOWING the challenging experience to affect you, then you don't suffer it to the point of nihilism or severe depression, suicide, etc.

Thankfully we have psychedelics to throw us a curve ball that can truly make us question reality, beyond just blind faith.

Faith is crucial, but without psychedelics it can easily be reasoned away.

If Neil Degrasse Tyson took a strong DMT trip, I think he would change his tune quite a bit.

A conscious Mind that powerful is an infinite process of discovery... in multiple dimensions, over endless lifetimes, through timeless evolutionary constructs.

Us.

Nobody is the Messiah.
Everyone is the Messiah.

There is no one person with all the answers... yet, everyone holds a piece of the answer.

That makes everyone an interesting, valuable member of this world... to be engaged, respected, contemplated. 

This makes Life more interesting, when even Donald Trump can be viewed through a lens of the lessons he (and the world) are learning through his actions... rather than knee-jerk judging him, then hating him... which only serves to make you miserable.

The grand idea in a nutshell (imho)... stop looking for negatives in Life. Start looking at what each person, scenario, trauma event, positive event, etc... is teaching you.

Consider Life a school of adventure.

Never accept that things are going to Hell (like this current virus pandemic).

Instead, contemplate what the Universe is up to... WHY is this happening to the planet? What lessons are being taught to the different people by this quarantine, economic pressure, social distancing?

Remove yourself from the Polarity swing of Good vs Evil, and simply become the observer of Life.

Build a mindset of Compassion towards everything... with the strategy to embrace every emotion that triggers and unravel it, to understand WHY it triggered you.

That's the work.

If you use this lens to view the world and become better at engaging your own internal self, you transend the chaos of the polarity swing. You USE the swing for self-mastery, rather than the swing using you.

In time, this opens you up to a Higher Consciousness. It relaxes the mind so that you can view Life clearly. The effect of this is sidestepping severe depression, anxiety, etc... as you are playing the game of Life, not being played by it.

On the other hand, if you trip with a focused intent... such as ""What is Life?"" or ""Why am i here?"" or even something less cosmic like ""How can i stop my OCD?"" or ""Why am i so lost/depressed/anxious in Life?""

Then sit down with the psychedelic and meditate while it's hitting, stay focused on it... uninterrupted by people, loud distracting music or movies, etc... just quiet your mind and listen, prepare to have a conversation in your mind.

Many would argue to begin with Meditation and skip the drugs altogether... because the drugs are just going to lead you back to the Meditation.

That's the beginning of the path. Learn everything you can about Meditation (and mysticism), then do the work to heal yourself. Become the Alchemist.

Many Westerners don't believe in this mystical stuff anymore, despite having a strong belief in Christianity... despite the long history of Mysticism in mankinds existence (Egyptian Alchemy, Greek Philosophy, Hinduism, Buddhism, Zen, Witchcraft, Oracles, Tarot, Mediums, etc, etc, etc)... even despite the acceptance of Meditation and Yoga into the culture... many, many people still don't actually believe in the art of Communining with nature for answers to Life's cosmic truths.

So... Nature has given us psychedelics, because we are still stuck thinking we are just dumb animals that eat, sleep and poop... and as Westerners we like ""one pill cures"" and nothing else... enter the recent discoveries of LSD by Aldous Huxley, and the now infamous DMT.

Westerners need a little more proof these days, and psychedelics help provide that... but they are a feedback loop, they just end up telling you that the abilities you are seeking are already inside you. They ARE you.

It's a mix of growing pains and plain old Life lessons. It does get better.

You'll find plenty of good times in the future, then something will happen and you'll be facing a new challenge that makes you have thoughts/feelings like you're experiencing now. It's normal.

It doesn't have to be though. There are solutions to reigning in and taking control of the emotional rollercoaster. They take serious work though, internal growth.

If you're interested in getting a jumpstart on this, rather than waiting for a midlife crisis or some other inevitable (seemingly) traumatic event down the road... research Meditation.

It's much more than simply ""calming your mind""... meditation practices are very deep, psychological therapy techniques that you contemplate on your own to unravel WHY you feel the unexplainable emotions that rule your life.

After 7000 years of cultivation by millions of Yogi's, Gurus and Alchemists, real Meditation is now a Science. It works in ways you can't even imagine.

When you do this work for real, it pays for real. Eradicate anxiety, depression... grow deep-seated confidence and contemplation of the workings of the Universe and your fellow man... seek Truth, earn Wisdom.

It's not easy at first, but it gets easy... then it gets Interesting. Really, really interesting. We're talking about the study of the human mind / body complex, human history and the wisdom passed down from great thinkers... and the mystical aspects of Life. The unexplained.

Not everyone is ready to tackle Life on this level at an early age... but it's definitely worth it. The sooner you discover your footing, the sooner you can use the stability to build an incredible Life for yourself.

I just wanted to put this out there so you hear someone say it. I didn't have anyone to point this out to me until I was much later in Life, and in retrospect I can see how useful it could have been all those years i spent acting like everything was miserable and hopeless.

That said, you aren't a failure... you can't fail in the grand scheme of things. Life is just teaching you to be strong. It gets much more interesting (and goes by faster) if you view it that way and accept the challenge... like a game. Focusing on the bad is what makes it bad, negative reinforcement doesn't work. At all.

Look into it next time you feel like you need to get your mind right. It's a strange habit that will suck you in and turn into a mindset that you can use to run your Life. It's almost like having ""a Code""... which is a priceless tool to have on this journey.

Trump Loves his Money.
Ted Bundy Loved Power.
Jeffery Dahlmer Loved Food. üòõ
John Wayne Gacy Loved Little Boys.

Given, the things these men loved were atrocious... but they still did these things in the process of chasing their Love.

This is why the phrase ""God is Love"" rings true and persists.

This material realm is a harsh playground of God acting out his Love in every imaginable way.

You may hate God for this... but why do you? Because you LOVE people and hate to see them suffer, that's why. You HATE out of LOVE!

Love is not a simple heart flutter for a pretty girl... Jesus didn't get weak knees and butterflies in his stomach every time he met another human being, but he still Unconditionally Loved them with the Compassion of a mother to her child.

Love is the most complex concept that humanity has to face. It's LITERALLY the reason we are here playing this game.

Jesus Loved humanity because he recognized that he was looking into his own face everytime he met another person. He KNEW the illusion of Self in Duality.

He knew others were suffering their ignorance, and tried to Enlighten the masses to the Illusion... but alas, low consciousness is part of the game... the individual doesn't learn the lesson without living through a period of ""forgetting"" who they are.

THAT is Evolution.

Raising your Consciousness to eventually reach your Highest Self.

When humanity finally wakes up, this civilization will transcend and go on to help other lower vibration realms grow their Consciousness... by flirting around the fringes of Life, disrupting others dreams with sleep paralysis, haunting their houses, acting as entities in psychedelic trips teaching the wisdom of Alchemy and purifying the spirit to get closer to self-realization... basically, trying to WAKE THEM UP so they begin to question the Spiritual side of Life. That's the real game... wake up and learn Love.

The game of Good and Evil is simply a natural state of Universal Polarity. Yin & Yang. These opposites must exist for us to recognize any relativity. If ALL was Love, there would be no CHOICE. That's why this harsh realm exists, it's a boot camp with lots of (perceived) Free Will.

So the concept of ""Evil"" is a necessary evil, one side of a dualistic polarity... but the name of that dualistic Polarity Scale is ""Love"".

It's all Love. All the Time.

The whole point is to be like Jesus and recognize that repulsion of the world ""out there"" is an illusion of duality. The truth is that we are LITERALLY all one Conscious Entity.

All is Mind.
Oneness.

When you truly realize this (self-realization / enlightenment)... it's impossible to hate yourself.

You see everything as yourself committing all the games of Life... good and bad.

While it can be challenging... when you know something, you know it in your soul, your bones, your essence... it becomes a relief to know (and comes with more challenges, as others don't know, you need to adapt to them with Compassion).

This is where men like Rumi, Alan Watts, Marcus Auralius, Plato and Manly P Hall come in... these men KNOW, and therefore were able to teach what they knew by playing the Zen Koan game of dancing around the truth, helping others discover it naturally... because they knew to say it outright would get them killed, like Jesus.

I started researching the connection and found that MANY classic alien abduction experiences (moving lights behind the blinds, presence in the room, etc) are linked to pharmaceutical drugs.

Years later... after a variety of other interesting life experiences, i'm recognizing the connection between SP and Spirituality.

In a nutshell, there are polar energies at work... postive and negative, both ends of a singular spectrum of energy. There are forces working each side of this unavoidable existential law (Yin & Yang).

When you entertain low vibrational energy such as Hate, Fear, Guilt, Shame, Loathing... you open yourself up to being ""fed upon"" by entities which desire your living force (that black fog you mentioned). They do things to reinforce Fear in you, that's the food... which also may explain why the world lives in a perpetual state of Fear thru negative news, corrupt politics, etc... these powers are trying to keep society vibrating low, and they influence the weak to create these scenarios globally.

Sounds crazy, i know... but nobody actually knows anything for certain on this planet, so i've opened my mind to historical concepts like ""Zen"" and ""Alchemy""... fascinating stuff!

My point being... the pharmaceutical drugs may be part of this low vibration plan i just mentioned (do you reeeally trust Big Pharma?)... it almost seems like taking those drugs is literally a BEACON that shines thru the veil to tell these afterlife entities that you are weak... or worse yet, the pills are literally being created to MAKE you weak.

These types of theories begin to put a deeper spin on the concept of Alien Abductions, Shadow People, etc. Wild stuff... but not exactly impossible. 

Read some Spiritual stuff and you'll begin to recognize this has been discussed for 10,000 years now... with many, many, many mystics and psychedelic users vouching for it's authenticity and the ability to experience this aspect of Life personally (Meditation). It's well recognized behind all major religions through to Peruvian Shamans and even Aztec dieties. The same kind of stories as i mention above.

Insane ideas... but hard to discount... because it's simply NOT that far-fetched.

I can steal your energy... so why couldn't a Conscious entity in a slightly different dimension be able to do the same thing?

Anyway, the solution... i believe if you are being plauged by anything weird like that, it's simply a wake-up call. It's time to reconcile your life and learn to vibrate higher.

Figure out what's toxic around you...  take control of your emotions and pay attention to how you feel (all the time = Mindfulnes)... learn to keep yourself happy and no react instinctively at every little thing (getting cut off in traffic, stop yourself from getting angry because you recognize it's a pointless use of negative energy)... focus on becoming a master of yourself, your body, your emotions, how you affect other people's lives, the planet, etc.

Consciously Raise Your Vibration.

It's good for releasing Depression and Anxiety, as self-mastery builds a character foundation that is able to face all of lifes trials with integrity and thoughtfullness... which i believe, is exactly why we are here in this weird lost realm called ""Life on Earth"".

depression,fl1vfev,t3_flt63o,1584737121.0,"It hurts because you won't face the pain. üíØ

This is why you hear of people Meditating (or Healing).

One of the many Meditation practices available is the process of quieting your mind to focus specifically on the pain you feel inside... literally, try to identify the physical organs or body parts where the pain resides.

Once you are able to get a feel for this, look up emotion / body charts online and explore what emotions are known to be connected to each organ. This is also a good time to read more about Meditation and other subjects like Chakras and Spirituality.

Now herecs the important part... once you have identified the emotion and the associated body part that hurts due to this emotion, it's time to face it.

What I mean by facing it is this... you are trying to understand WHAT is creating that energy disruption within your mind. That emotion is the result of a thought process in your mind that you aren't letting go off. To let go is called ""Forgiveness"".

You need to unravel your mind to identify why your body is holding onto these painful emotions... then forgive yourself (or others) for the event or situation that created them.

This isn't about ""he did this to me"" or ""it's not fair""... those are excuses, not solutions.

This is about RELEASING the pain... so you can heal, and feel better.

You have to be honest with yourself in this work... it's literally the relationship you have with yourself... there is no shortcut, no excuses, no tricks. You can't lie to yourself and expect positive results. You need to give in. Surrender. Forgive yourself.

It's tough work, it can be difficult, confusing, painful... but holy fucking hell, it works!! üòç

You hurt because you don't Love yourself. You don't allow yourself to be accepted. You haven't forgiven yourself.

If you are really struggling, this is the way out. It's all on you to be honest with yourself and let go of everything that you don't accept about yourself, about Life, people, everything.

Just let go. You'll be surprised to find when you shine light on those hidden parts of yourself, they dissolve... for good. You just have to try.

This is only one facet of what Meditation is capable of for healing humanity. It's so simple, yet effective for creating a content Life of Happiness in the face of all Life's little (and big) challenges.

Many people don't understand these things and project preconceived notions on them, cutting their nose off to spite their face... until they too, eventually get caught in a spiral and have no choice but to TRY.

So, try. ‚úå‚ù§

Your belief system is what creates your experiences in Life. So it stands to reason that your belief system would create your SP experiences as well.

Most people in this world are severely damaged by their environments. Depression, Anxiety, Anger, Entitlement, Fear... these are the baseline emotions most people live under these days.

Is it any surprise that people report experiencing horrors, when they live every day nurturing horrific emotions?

Perhaps you naturally vibrate higher energy levels, so you have more pleasant experiences.

This is what Meditation is all about... trying to get your mind right, so you can identify the lower vibrations that haunt you... and nurture the higher vibrations that create wellness and good living.

My whole point here is this... just because everyone else is seeing Demons, doesn't mean that you should to.

Psychonaut,fkia7jr,t3_fildr5,1584215250.0,"You need to take into account McKenna's last trip (or near last) where he finally hit bedrock in his journeys: 

http://www.mckennite.com/articles/badtrip

""a lack of all meaning, a lack of all meaning.""

This phrase alone speaks directly to the Hindu / Buddist / Zen concept of ""Nothingness"". This is not a new revelation, in fact, it's the oldest secret teaching known to man (Thoth/Alchemy/All is Mind).

The general idea is that at the very source of Consciousness, is absolute nothing. It can be no other way. Out of nothing, the natural polarity is Everything. It's a paradox.

Every single seemingly important question in Life is a Paradox. You are always trapped between Yin & Yang. Infinitely.

So when you trip deep enough and reach the full realization that even beyond the ""Love"", the absolute beginning of anything; is Nothing.

No meaning. No purpose. No aliens playing marbles with planets. No answer to WHY everything exists.

It just, IS.

This is why you feel uncomfortable when you're alone with yourself (no distractions). This is why it's difficult for many to Meditate. This is why we fall into Depression. Why existential dread exists.

When you finally pass the concept of God's Love, and contemplate the creation of the multiverse from the highest perspective possible (which is what true Spiritual practice / seeking Enlightenment is all about; unfolding the Wisdom of Creation)... you begin to see the distinction between Brahman and ParaBrahman... and concepts like McKenna's gain clarity.

In a nutshell, the only answers are the one's you believe. You won't find satisfaction in anything BUT Love. Even after this Life, the existential questions persist. It's a complicated, enormous monstrosity of Life living in every imaginable way, in infinite directions.

Why?

Because at the very root of Awareness... 

""a lack of all meaning, a lack of all meaning.""

The fact that creation exists IS the meaning. It's the mind of Consciousness exploring the opposite of it's base nature, which is absolute Nothingness.

That's it.

So make your Life as important or unimportant as you like... cuz that's all their is. Your choice is all there is.

It's a dark and heavy concept... but it also comes with ""Love"". You can choose Hate (duality) or you can choose Love (Oneness).

It really doesn't matter, as the Yin/Yang spins infinitely... but beware your choice, as you DO have to Live with it.

Do you really want to Hate for infinity? Or is Love a more pleasing and beneficial approach to yourself and those around you?

There is nothing to worry about... but paradoxically, you have nothing to worry about, forever.

I think that's what got to McKenna. He wasn't ready to accept that it's truly an endless well.

We are immortal. Quit thinking in terms of monkeys and mushrooms and start thinking in terms of Alchemy and Egypt.

They lead you to an understanding of Life that you won't get by following the herd mentality.

Take an interest in it. Read some stuff. Practice.

When you write things out it tends to make them more real, you kinda imprint them in your mind (think study notes). Be careful what you write in forums, online, text, etc. It adds up and can make things seem worse than they are.

People in positions of authority are usually receptive to the people they are there to guide. No school principle wants a kid suffering without help... especially if parents are neglecting.

Depending on your needs you could always try a Therapist app, there's at least one big one out there that was pitched on TV by Michael Phelps.

Though if you need immediate help and can't seem to get through to the doctors through the phone, it may help to have a school authority pull strings to get it done for you.

They will usually go to bat for you, if you ask. They want to help, as long as you're in serious need.

I would speak with your parents again though, they should be your first line of support. Impress upon them how serious you are.

If they don't take you seriously, an authority at school/work will... i think it's actually a legal thing for them too.

You shouldn't be having this much trouble, perhaps you aren't speaking to people with enough ""this is serious"" in your voice? No offense, just trying to give you some ideas.
