You‚Äôre right, being male is supposed to have all of these privileges but we bear a disproportionate amount of responsibility in my opinion.  Our behaviors are in a tighter box too:  Be strong, be quiet, be a provider, and be a protector.

This disgusting act is morally wrong.  This is medically unethical and inhumane.  It is only legal, right now.  All I care about is the issue we are all here to primarily discuss, our feelings of grief, name is right there in the title.  This is a Reddit page for males who have been harmed emotionally, mentally, and physically by circumcision and to be honest society at large doesn‚Äôt care about us, at all.  If it was any other body part it wouldn‚Äôt be so humorous to society at large.  It‚Äôs sad.  If it wasn‚Äôt sanctioned by one or more religions it wouldn‚Äôt be prevalent outside of the USA.  If the USA wasn‚Äôt so stupidly arrogant it wouldn‚Äôt be done here at all or still.  Also, Corn Flakes are nasty for real as was the creator of that nastiness.  So we can have a debate on how men and women contribute to this or don‚Äôt but all I care about is if my fellow dudes are ok.  We are a messed up Reddit family full of grief, but it‚Äôs still a family of sorts.  More than we get offline.  So my thought is if you‚Äôre with us thank you, I personally welcome you.  If you are not ask yourself why you are on this page, maybe to learn...but please be respectful at all times.  I don‚Äôt want to debate anything, I just want to support and listen."
