Where I was crouching/ sitting wasn't so precarious,  but getting up on these eight foot stacks of pallets using one of the footholds I had to definitely was. Getting down was even wworse. My boss was a little freaked out,  but had to concede it was the best way to stack as many as possible and save my shoulders because there was just a narrow walkway between the two stacks of pallets and I was having to carry radiators in there above my head. Once I got up there, someone smaller than me could lift them halfway, and I'd grab it from there and find a place. This way, we fit a ton and no one had to lift heavy things overhead. Doesn't mean the climbing wasn't at best sketchy though."
