AmItheAsshole,fqia9m5,t1_fqi4pvr,1589393209.0,"okay sorry this is so long but i want to help you not make a mistake at work lol. so, i think in general sex is natural and normal and body parts shouldn’t necessarily be sexualized etc, but our culture isn’t there yet, right? and things can have multiple aspects to them. pornography is a video genre, but it’s also about sex. the sex part of it is what people think of most. when someone is pregnant, you can guess they had sex to get that way, but mostly people just think of the baby and emotional aspect. if you talk about trying to conceive, people definitely know that means sex, but if you talk about it in a more clinical manner people will think of the emotional aspects. if you talked about how you try every day multiple times a day then the focus is on the sexual aspect.

and basically, making people think/talk about sexual things (to a reasonable degree, like if someone has a thing for feet and you have no clue then you would not be responsible until you were made aware) when they don’t want to is probably sexual harassment. if you can talk about things in a way that are work related, like if you’re a fertility doctor you have to talk about it, or you’re a cameraman on a porn set and have to talk about what shots to take, then that’s fairly reasonable, unavoidable, and appropriate. if a person is uncomfortable when there’s just no way around it and they knew that going in, that’s not your fault. but if you make people think of sex when it’s completely unrelated to work, or even if it’s related to work but you’re speaking about it in a really raunchy way, then that’s not okay. you shouldn’t make a reasonable person think of something that makes them uncomfortable. with your example, no reasonable person would primarily associate rachel with sex. sex is definitely the primary aspect of porn. it would be very difficult to only converse about the other aspects.

again, i don’t agree with so many things being sexualized and i want less things to be seen as sexual. and i think we both agree that it’s fine for sexual things to be off limits at work. but i think a lot more falls under that definition than you might realize. it’s all about what a typical, reasonable person would think."
AmItheAsshole,fqi3ciq,t1_fqi2my1,1589389246.0,"if you tell someone they have a pornstache and they get uncomfortable then you sexually harassed them. i would even say bringing up the term pornstache, not saying they have one at all, could be sexual harassment if they feel uncomfortable because you’re bringing up sexual topics in a non clinical way that are probably unrelated to the specific work at hand. most people do not want to have conversations about anything sex related at work.

if they feel comfortable with the topic it’s not harassment but like why take the risk in a professional environment in the first place; it’s still an inappropriate conversation for work."

 i would try learning some social anxiety techniques about letting go of things that already happened and trying not to feel shame in them. learn to have some compassion and empathy for yourself. like if your best friend did something a little embarrassing it would be endearing, right? if you even remembered them doing it at all. you wouldn’t look down on them. 

if you mean it more like you feel like such a different person now than you were in the past, that makes sense too but i don’t have much specific advice besides most people change and maybe a therapist could help you connect your current self and your past self."

so i feel like it’s okay to let someone know that you struggle with intense emotions and right now you’re struggling with suicidal ideation for example and could they do these things to support you while you do these other things to get help, but you shouldn’t be telling someone everyday that you’re suicidal. i have made the mistake and it’s just really unfair to do to someone."

AmItheAsshole,fni3v58,t1_fnhyrma,1586973522.0,"okay, i definitely understand that, but i think the overarching way you are framing this is concerning. like you said there was enough ingredients for him to have 4 grilled and cheese and 6 PBJ. half of those are yours, you know! 

the planning for 21 vs 42 lunches thing was so good to point out, but don’t let yourself fall to the wayside and think he has 10 lunches. you get some too! and please forgive me for snooping, but i checked out your profile, and this is a matter of health for you if you’re diabetic. you absolutely need good food available, always! it is not acceptable for him to get all the desirable food and you be left with scraps if you suddenly need to eat something.

i really admire the way you have stood up for yourself already, and i’m not intending to criticize you, i just want to encourage you."
AmItheAsshole,fnhu9e1,t1_fnhql0b,1586968946.0,"love the way you’re handling this, except the grilled cheese should have been yours. don’t cook and go hungry. 

continue making grocery shopping his contribution. he needs to go back to the store and get what you need so you don’t go hungry, and you need to feed yourself first if you’re cooking. if something runs out and becomes a problem, he needs to deal with it because he created the problem in the first place. do not become a martyr, let him suffer his own consequences."
BPD,fnhbuzh,t1_fngszzw,1586959387.0,"ok but seriously how can your knee jerk response to being told you’re dismissive is to be even more dismissive? you keep saying that the mental illnesses are not the same and describing other real issues as “just depressed or anxious”. like you, not him, are the one making this a competition, stop projecting this onto your boyfriend when he tries to relate to you.

i have had multiple mental illnesses and they have differed in their acute severity but i would not classify BPD as the worst. not that there was a worst; they all severely disrupted my life and continue to do so on bad days. but i have never even thought to compare them or rank them.

good people are going to be empathetic and try to relate to you. just because they don’t have the same daily emotional intensity does not mean they are incapable of understanding how you might feel. when people relate to you, they aren’t trying to dismiss your issues, they are trying to show you that you don’t have to be alone in this world. you don’t have to remind them that they have not experienced intense mood swings on the daily like us. no one will ever truly understand what you have been through, not even others with BPD, because all experiences are different. it’s not ok to say you know how your boyfriend feels and that it’s somehow not as bad. you are not the judge of all emotions and suffering. and he allows you to empathize with him while you shut him out from empathizing with you. i feel like you are focused too much on trying to make others understand the nuances and intensity of what you have felt instead of focusing on asking others for support and accepting their support"

manx,fmzn137,t3_fycdqo,1586525010.0,"not a cat breeder but some experience with dog breeding. to be blunt, a breeder will not want to introduce a cat with an unknown heritage into their lines. you have no idea the temperament of his parents or what conditions/diseases they may have suffered from. also, at 3-4 he is starting to get a little old for breeding. they generally want the animals to be fairly young. so he would not have a long career ahead of him. 

your cat will not be sad if you get him fixed, and honestly no one will be willing to pay a stud fee for your cat’s services. and just because you don’t have to deal with kittens doesn’t mean he can’t accidentally get some other stray cat pregnant. getting him fixed is the right thing to do and the smart thing to do."

bestoflegaladvice,fmokx05,t1_fmoje9g,1586262164.0,"literally straight from the 2016 election wikipedia page:

“Clinton received 2.87 million more votes than Trump did (the largest margin ever for a losing presidential candidate)”

“The United States government's intelligence agencies concluded on January 6, 2017 that the Russian government had interfered in the 2016 elections[22][23][24] in order to ‘undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency’”

so the majority of people did not vote for him and countless were victims of a foreign government’s interference. don’t blame people for their own deaths regardless it’s a disgusting lack of compassion"
