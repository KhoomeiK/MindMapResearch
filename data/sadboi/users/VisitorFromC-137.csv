depression,foi5ahq,t1_foi29gj,1587779003.0,"Fuck yeah, I like cars too. Don't be ashamed of getting that check. You know you need it so don't be ashamed. I worked at a Subway when I was like 16, for about 2 days before they put me on the sandwich line and I never showed back up. Fuck that. I wanted to crumble the whole time. When I'm in public it helps me to remind myself that many others that I'm going to be engaging in conversation with, are likely going through their own anxieties. I've been doing construction pretty much ever since and I'm 24 now."
depression,fnmgd91,t3_g2iy50,1587070936.0,"Make yourself a priority to you. Eventually someone will make you a high priority. But remember that you are number 1 and always should be. To me the it's been a positive thing realizing that nobody is supposed to save me from the way I feel. It's all you. 

Stay safe!"
depression,fm99mwb,t3_ftt3g9,1585864362.0,Don't overthink it before you get there. He/she will know where to start. Just be honest and they'll let you know what they think. Best of luck! I hope you have an amazing experience!
depression,fm3af6b,t3_fssxj5,1585717246.0,"I would definitely let your boyfriend know that there is something going on. He could help support you. I'd also look in to talking to a professional if you're not sure why, and there may not even be a reason. Emotions are irrational and depression is no exception. Keep your head up and stay safe!"

depression,fm1sb8h,t1_flzwkwe,1585684118.0,"We'll all probably come out a little different, hopefully for the better. I usually shave like every three days because it looks decent for a few days afterwards but have been shaving every day after my shower and brushing my teeth 3 times a day. It's the little things. And the best part is that you know everything you're doing is for yourself. Hoping I can keep this mentality when things speed back up."
depression,flzxohi,t1_flzwo4a,1585637019.0,"This!
Anything you can benefit from is a step in the right direction. Up until about a year ago I used to pick a random subject that intrigued me and then would usually spend anywhere between a week and a month (until I get bored) studying it at the end of the day when I'd otherwise play videogames. I always felt more accomplished and ready for bed. Plus I'd have a conversation piece for work the next day."
depression,flzx1oq,t1_flzwjyv,1585636378.0,It's crazy how the depression section can be a happy place at times :) (:
depression,flzwsfk,t3_fs7oem,1585636124.0,I couldn't even imagine. You're nothing less than you were the day before. That's just one sick fuck. How old are you guys? Hopefully people aren't doing weird shit to him at home causing that kind of behavior. I hope the rest of your week takes a turn for the better!
depression,flzwdty,t3_fs7qdo,1585635719.0,"Good on you! Reddit has done wonders for me as well. Always good to see people helping people and EVEN BETTER seeing posts like this. Seriously, I could be having a shit day and read something like your post and it just melts away for whatever reason. So thank YOU for posting.

Everyone stay safe!"
depression,flxjqow,t3_fp72y2,1585584241.0,"I had to drop most social media. It's perfectly designed to get you down in the dumps. First you see people post mostly nothing but the ""good times"" so we assume that's what everyone is up to all of the time, which obviously trumps what most people honestly have going on. In-between all of that, you have to see dumb posts by people like that who either think they're better than others (seems toxic and self-alienating to me) or just don't understand. I hated myself for feeling lazy for a while before realizing that depression was the culprit. Try to keep your head up! Reddit has been pretty insightful for me on my journey, just getting to see everyone grow together and lend advice that helped them get through the inevitable troubled times. 

Stay safe, everyone!"
depression,flrqru3,t3_fqo1sx,1585425866.0,Oh and I've seen much worse grammer from some of my fellow Americans lol.
depression,flroa0j,t1_flkicox,1585424350.0,I hope things get better and that you have a good experience with the therapist!
depression,flrnlbu,t1_flk9q50,1585423935.0,"This exactly. I don't think it sounds like bullshit at all. Life is inevitably going to be a rollercoaster. There's always the possibility for better things just around the corner which I agree is reason enough to hold on. Like you said, it's highly unlikely that things stay as bad as they are."
depression,flrmyve,t1_flrmuxe,1585423557.0,Best of luck! It's an awesome journey!
depression,flrfmtm,t3_fqo1sx,1585419211.0,"For me it was just to stop and think about why I'm upset at times and then happy at others. If you need to feel sorry for yourself, that's the time to do it. To me it just felt like a weight off of my shoulders every time until I realized I enjoyed it so much that I'd take at least 20 minutes (usually longer) from my day to be alone and enjoy it."
depression,flree1h,t3_fpedh1,1585418498.0,"I wish things were different in your country. My dad was raised old fashioned and his family weren't the type to talk about emotions or even tell each other they love each other and my dad is the same way. So I don't talk to him about this sort of thing, either. Most people struggle with stress, anxiety and yes even depression at least once in their lives so don't alienate yourself or think anyone is better than you because of it. You have just as much right to be HAPPY (not just ok) as anyone else and I know that may not bring happiness in itself but NEVER assume anyone is better than you just because you're in a deep struggle. I hope you have a good school year!"
depression,flrcjdi,t3_fqo21c,1585417458.0,I definitely get where you're coming from. It's honestly a little scary how many people don't have the self awareness to notice they're depressed and go their whole life not knowing it.
depression,flrbwg3,t3_fqo1sx,1585417094.0,I went through a similar phase. I've never been diagnosed but it kind of sounds similar to HSP which is just being overly sensitive at times. Other times I'd be numb. Emotions are irrational so it's no surprise to find that they contradict one another but nobody wants to experience the bad ones. So I'd take time every day to just check in on myself while I was alone. That helped a lot. But I could be different. Have you talked to a trusted loved one?
depression,flrapjh,t3_fqo21c,1585416414.0,"Being aware is probably the only start to working on yourself, though. Simpler isn't always better. Do you have any hobbies?"
depression,flra5sx,t3_fqo2am,1585416098.0,"I 24m definitely don't think you should beat yourself up. I was in the same boat. I honestly came to appreciate the numbness until I realized that it was eating at me. Had to start making small changes. The first one was arranging some time during the day to think of all of the reasons I chose to be numb. You'll probably feel sorry for yourself for a while and maybe even cry (I did) but after a while I realized nobody was coming to save me and it was better that way. You're the only person you can check in with sometimes, and you definitely should. Rooting for you!"
makingfriends,flnqoq1,t1_fln2a9m,1585324035.0,"The state I live in, in the US only has roughly 60 cases so we're just being advised to stay home but I have to do my grocery shopping today and I'm still uneasy about it. I've been burnt out on video games for like a month but I'm lucky enough to have my little family to keep me busy. Strange time to be alive for sure."
makingfriends,flmqsei,t3_foqqsm,1585292822.0,I'm 24m pretty lucky to have my little family to isolate with. Crazy that some people are literally isolating alone! I'd drive myself insane. We're in North Dakota where we haven't had any deaths but we chose to start trying to isolate as soon as other places started and it was clear it wasn't just going away. Best if luck to everyone!
makingfriends,flmqe4q,t3_fpasug,1585292379.0,How long are they recomentlding you guys isolate for?
makingfriends,flmpysy,t1_flmfd01,1585291907.0,"I feel that. I get burnt out on games, too. Are you guys allowed out for supplies?"
depression,flmost9,t1_flmd4bz,1585290660.0,"Thank you, thank you!"
depression,fllcy0l,t3_fpb1l3,1585257961.0,"I personally wouldn't let anyone assume I was going to wait around. I'd tell her, whatever happens, happens. The fact that she wants to get back with you says she is depending on you to wait around. Totally agree 100% that you should work on healing but don't do anything for anyone other than yourself for a while. It'll feel weird as hell for the first while but you'll likely feel like a new person after getting into the habit of not depending on anyone and you'll appreciate yourself more. That alone will likely make you a lot more enjoyable person to be around. I'm on the same journey. Keep your head up!

Edit: I'm not saying you shouldn't be friends with her but don't make her your priority. You're #1"
depression,flkh1fr,t3_fp6vh2,1585240777.0,"I know this sounds dumb and maybe even played out but you shouldn't beat yourself up. I felt the exact same way from the age of like 17-21. Shit, I still have days where I just don't understand why I'm down. I like to blame it on the weather due to the fact that I'm at my worst in the winter. Not having friends takes a huge toll on your mental health and while you might feel incapable of finding close friends, the truth is, anyone can find people they connect with. It just takes time. No matter how different you might feel from others, there is someone it would resonate well with and reciprocate. Keep your head up and never give in!"
depression,flj59kf,t1_fkoxw98,1585199329.0,There is no joke or punchline. Keep trying to get out there. There is no elaborate scheme to keep you from finding happiness. Your time will come! Keep your head up.
politics,flhykh7,t3_fot3pr,1585171927.0,"It would be horrible if they had aired it. Such lies that could cause people to harm themselves or others shouldn't be aired, especially when it's from the mouth of someone that some people still trust for whatever reason."
Guitar,flbqm1m,t3_fbjkk7,1585010376.0,I think you need a new peg for it. I'm not sure if they're universal. Next time you string it I'd try putting the peg in a different hole just to see if it stays.

depression,flbper6,t3_fmi67k,1585009597.0,Super happy that you're doing better!!!
depression,flaye18,t3_fne1mg,1584993636.0,Definitely a strange time to be alive. A lot of panic. Keep your head up. Things will go back to normal some day. Hopefully sooner than later.
selfimprovement,fjiu7uo,t3_fdkcrm,1583375850.0,That's dope! Congratulations!
selfimprovement,fj4gd78,t3_fbbvnd,1583007630.0,Don't burn yourself out. Make small changes because you will have to make other changes to accompany the changes you want to make. You're not a loser if you're trying. Keep your head up!
selfimprovement,fj3a1en,t3_fb1ifd,1582975048.0,"I'm the same exact way. I grew up seeing how few things my dad actually thinks positively of and because of it, I'm always scared to let my guard down. Sometimes I remind myself that I'm not here to impress my dad or live up to whatever vision he had for me. It has both ruined very important relationships between myself and others and the ability to level and connect with many others because I feel like I have to be someone I'm not, in order to satisfy his image of me.
I know that was only a small part of your post but it hit close to home for me."
selfimprovement,fj39913,t3_fb87sr,1582973886.0,"I was a bit of a bully growing up (far from it, now) and I can say with confidence that any time I acted less than nice to someone and they just ignored it and went about their day, they ""won"" in my head. Trust me I do know that every time I was less than polite to someone who wasn't impolite towards me, it was a loss on my end for sure. 

Keep your head up."
selfimprovement,fj38vn2,t1_fj2ry7o,1582973332.0,Yeah I'd have to agree with you that those principles are probably not very good ones. They honestly sound a little ignorant/toxic to me. But what do I know?
depression,fj37wks,t3_doqwow,1582971885.0,"Almost every day i see someone I want to talk to more about what's going on and then I realize where that might lead when one of us reaches that emotional fatigue. It's good advice. It does make more sense to me to post it publicly also, because as you've stated it will likely be useful to a handful of people. Thanks so much for clarifying this."
depression,fj37db8,t3_fay1sf,1582971082.0,"So stoked to read this. My anxiety isn't quite that bad but it is still pretty uplifting to see someone go out of their way for someone struggling on the inside, knowing she didn't have to say anything. I hope every day gets better for you!"
depression,fiz9to1,t3_fa7osq,1582857539.0,Happy 19th!!!
selfimprovement,fiwk1we,t3_fa3hng,1582789186.0,It'll happen. Don't rush it :)

depression,figsfj9,t3_exo6f1,1582403031.0,"I'm not in a suicidal state but every winter I slip into depression and typically destroy any relationship I'm currently in. The only difference this time is that I have a 15 month old daughter that I absolutely cannot be moping around in front of. Her mother and I split, and all I really do is beat myself up inside all day wishing I could have done better even if the breakup had been inevitable. Thinking about setting up an appointment of sorts mainly just for counseling. I don't like the idea of taking pills. I'd rather fight depression than have the pills make me someone I'm not. Hopefully I get an appointment with someone that is reasonably easy to talk to and could maybe even shed some advice.

 Best of luck to all of you!"
