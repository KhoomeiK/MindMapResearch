AskMen,f7xkaca,t1_f7xitwy,1574061106.0,"Lol, it‚Äôs not like I am the most attractive person either!
It‚Äôs funny, all these societal pressure on physical appearance really makes it hard to evaluate a person and how he/she is on the inside.
I was thinking how there are a lot of chubby guys, and I mean those who have desk job or other type of jobs which has little to no physical activity involved, and a person eventually does start gaining weight. But what about the fact how hard that person worked? How mentally fatigued he must be. This was just a shoutout to those who don‚Äôt have the time to take care of themselves, nonetheless I do believe your health should be a priority but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to fit a standard. You don‚Äôt have to look like a CK model and it is not a realistic expectation either(but hey if you were born with such good gene, lucky you!) 
Some men have beautiful smile, beautiful eyes, beautiful hands and those little things makes you unique. 
Maybe it sounds like I am shitposting or am being patronising, but trust me I am not. Point is, of course I am not talking about obese guys, just a bit chubby ones who are like nerdy and passionate about things which they enjoy.

It‚Äôs all downhill for us after we die.
I like to think of it this way, my consciousness was ‚Äúactive‚Äù for a short period if time, i.e. when I am alive. Billions of years passed before I was born and billions of years will pass after I die. I won‚Äôt be here. Not that I need to because our life in its entirety was pretty meaningless. Eat, sleep, sex, pay taxes and shit. I used to be delusional that our life, each and everyone has a meaning. It doesn‚Äôt. Suicide is not really the answer, honestly I don‚Äôt think there really is any answer. But I will say this, my limited ability to learn and retain information is not enough for me. I want to sacrifice it all for comprehending complexity, yet there is a catch. I am mortal and to live I need food, shelter which is only accessible through money. And to earn money I have to be content with a shit job where I have to do the same shit everyday and have asshole supervisors. I do believe there was so much in the world, so much it could offer. Unfortunately, the world itself has some set regulations and standards which needs to be abided to access certain privileges and to feel certain emotions. I am sorry I am rambling. I don‚Äôt want to die though. When I said I want to donate my body, I should have stated while I am alive. I know for sure I can be used for many amazing experiments. One of which is experimenting on my brain so that mysteries can be unveiled."
