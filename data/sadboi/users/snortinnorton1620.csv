Secondly, the best advice I have ever been given: 
Live an hour at a time. I'll explain.

I read all that and sounds exactly like me.

I'm currently in the middle of what you're trying to do and there's days I feel I'm failing miserably because theres truly so much about myself I dont like.

However, I am a whole lot farther than I was 3 months ago because I started living an hour at a time.

One day I set a timer for an hour and went about scrolling through Reddit and my timer went off what I thought was so quick so I set another one not even bothering to check the time, even though its always in the right upperhand corner of my screen. I look down after the 2nd alarm went off and realized two hours had passed. That was my turning point. I have been wasting so much time on my damn phone.

So the next day I set my timer for an hour and did my usual morning browsing. After that timer went off I then turned off my phone and set a timer for another hour on my stove so i wouldn't be tempted and cleaned. I told myself for just 1 hour. I hated every minute of it but I got something done. The rest of the day I kept setting hour timers and its amazing how much time Ive been wasting.

I did the hour timers for a week, then a month, now its been 3 months, I've lost 10 pounds, and Ive gotten more done than I ever thought I could.

So take it small and live an hour at a time. üíú You will thank yourself"

BPD,ero0ji8,t3_c2xe96,1561065347.0,"Ive been employed off and on since I was 15 (26 now) and have quit every job (around 10) except 3. My longest job (3 years) I was fired from because I went to jail for unpaid parking tickets. I used my 1 call to call my dad and let them know which he did, however they counted it as 2 no call no shows and fired me cause i didnt call them directly.

 Oddly enough the other 2 were the best jobs and bosses ive ever held but lost them both to someone tattletelling on me for marijuana use for my anxiety attacks. Fucking sucks not living in a legal state. They HATED letting me go but policy is policy and I totally understood though I was CRUSHED.

My last job was amazing for what I did (I was a receptionist/kennel tech/bather) at a small family owned boarding facility. I got to work with dogs and cats all day. However it was the WORST experience I've ever had with a boss. Not only did she ""manage"" (I use that term loosely because she was hardly ever there) the facility she also was a real estate agent. She was CONSTANTLY on her phone or apple watch and had NO sympathy or empathy for anyone with a learning curve (example a 50 y/o woman who had no real tech experience but was so eager to learn was there 2 days and she gossiped behind her back for being ""too stupid "" to work a computer)  or mental disability because ""thoes arent real and we need to get over ourselves"" (my cousins worked with me and she had real bad anxiety answering the phone. One day she got really upset my cousin wouldnt answer the phone on the first ring and she picked up the phone handled the client then slammed the phone down and I quote ""Was that fucking hard?! Anxiety over what?! That isnt real. Get overself and do your fucking job."" And then when my husband and I were going through a really rough patch she seemed very concerned and offered her help and an ear to listen to, only for her to tell EVERYONE about it and that i wasn't to be trusted to do my job correctly because I ""had my head in the clouds""  for me to be the laughing stock of the facility. Only reason i found out was because of my cousin who quit shortly after the phone incident. On top of all of that it was mandatory that we had a group chat. I would routinely get messages at 11 in the evening about something that hapened that day or the past few days and me not remebering what i had for breakfast let alone 2 days ago led to getting berated in the group chat for everyone to see. My breaking point was when I was having a very very off day. She asked me to do inventory. I miscounted 3 times and the rage this woman showed was insane. She proceeded to call me stupid and that my husband was right for wanting to seperate from me. She would too with the level of incompetence I displayed for simple tasks. I was so fucking angry it took everything i had not to get an assault charge that day. I promptly got my things and walked out."

The more you feel a task is going to take forever, like me with dishes, it will.

When nothing in life goes right, go left.

 Dive in even though I'm gonna bitch and complain about it not being perfect or me feeling under educated the entire time. Its going against my basic nature but I have a wedding dress to fit into lol 

In the spirit of going left;
I printed out a keto approved shopping list. That was it. I crossed off what I dont like/allergic to and bought as much of the food that I could and from that, THEN I made meals as I went along. It's chaos to live in the moment but any other way I wont accomplish dick lol

The parrishmiller narcissistic mother article I have read and actually found it on this thread from another post. I too clicked on it and it rocked me to my core. I went numb as I read through every single point as that was my childhood to a freaking T, also, not being able to fathom how on earth a mother could do that to her children. (there's 3 of us and I'm the oldest) I read it in like 30 mins but it took me 2 full days to process it. I was a wreck. 

My mother was a dental assistant and held the medical field higher than any other profession. If it wasnt medical, her daughter could not do it. I am terrified of blood and needles mostly from all the unnecessary Drs visits when I was younger. Shes pushed me since as young as I can remember to get educated in the health field and get a job in the health field or else I wouldnt lead a successful life. It was always her decisions about my future and I couldn't stand it. I was always rebelling against her which led to a stint in cosmetology school. It was a way to get her off my back about not having a career. Because I didn't finish due to to the undiagnosed BPD and ADHD, I now have 10k in student loans and owe 8k to Remington college unable to go back to school until I pay Remington college off (They will not release my transcripts to go to another school until they are paid off...Living paycheck to paycheck right now, unable to make payments) so I'm stuck in a never ending loop it seems and I always get so upset about it and feel like a failure in life. 
My father was an electrican growing up and currently he works with computer programs designing parts for CNC machines. He was NEVER around growing up working 7 days a week 12/14 hours. He has bipolar I and Intermittent Explosive disorder (medicated and in therapy now and working on a relationship after a long estrangement) so when I would put my foot down about my life, If I wasnt verbally berated by my mother she'd tell my father I was being insubordinate and the only way I ""would listen to her"" is by ""discipline"" so that lead to me trying to explain what happened, get quoted the bible on ""honoring thy mother and father"" and me not having any of it would talk back, enraging my dad and consequently I was beat with whatever was around and literally shoved into corners as he's hovering over me screaming at the top of his lungs. 

Im so sorry you felt you had to keep their secrets and the weight of the world on your shoulders. I cant even imagine. I realize that I am so lucky growing up in the social media/google era. It has saved me a lifetime of pain and always having to believe my mother is the only source of information and attention in this world.

My thoughts and good vibes are with you today. üíúüíúüíú and thank you for sharing your story with me."

I will not let her sabotage my progress. 
Thank you for your input!"
BPD,ephr5t4,t1_eph9v7h,1559230129.0,"Oh I agree.
Its the only option shes left me with. Its taking a toll on me and my marriage. Literally everytime I get off the phone with her or have to undo the ""scandal"" I crumble and cry cause it feels like im being ripped apart. I'm undergoing therapy now and able to see though her patterns. Its soulcrushing that I know she'll never change cause ""nothing is wrong with her"" and when I do go full No Contact, she'll accuse my husband of absuse and everyone will believe her because ""she an amazing mother and just has my best interests at heart.""  I just don't have it in me to defend myself anymore."

BPD,ep6sq37,t3_bu2dda,1559073094.0,Yep. I Have a garden and a hammock that whenever I get upset I go to even if its late at night I'll climb in my hammock. My husband will leave me alone for 2-3 hours and just let me be.
BPD,ep6rtq5,t3_bu3n0o,1559072806.0,Unable to control my emotions and binge eating are mine. Losing my home and all my possessions to Hurricane Harvey took a very very hard toll on me.
BPD,ep6rmoq,t1_ep6ouls,1559072731.0,I FEEL THIS IN MY SOUL!! Im 26 and this brought me to tears. Im exactly the same way with the exception of impulsive spending. My husband is in control of the finances mainly and gives me little bits of responsibility here and there so I feel important and contributing yet not overwhelmed or able to sink us.

BPD,ep5ig3y,t3_btv5ma,1559056415.0,"Oh god yes.
My mother has severe NPD and Bipolar II with psychotic delusions episodes, my dad I.E.D and PTSD.

My childhood wasn't much of a childhood. Shaving and bras at 6 and dying my hair to match my mom's at 8 when my blonde hair turned brown. Hearing about how much of an asshole my dad was ,turning me against him so she wasn't the bad guy or blaming me to my dad for the $500 shopping spree because I needed clothes when i all i needed was a costume for a play.

I was seen as her property and best friend only for  her and was forced to be an extention of her all while never being good enough. She would sabbotage every friendship I had leaving me very isolated. My dad was never home ( construction worker so always working 7 days a week 12/14 hr days)  so when he was home, she would tell him all the awful things I did, like tell her no to chores (when in fact I did tell her no but because I didn't want my hair curled)  which he wouldn't take my side because I had had a habit of lying to avoid trouble would lead to my dad losing his temper and spanking me with too much force leaving bruises and welts for days.

I think about it almost every day."
BPD,ep2fyx8,t3_btr0bt,1559007866.0,"Yayy!!! Proud of you!
I did this contstantly from 14 to 21 and have slept with many men and women. Ruined a lot of geniune friendships.
 I eventually stopped when I started dating my current husband. Im 26 now and its nice that I've chilled out on the sexual validation. Still seek in other ways with friends though. Working on it"
