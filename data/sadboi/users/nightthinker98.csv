Overall for me, once I was thinking realistically, I found that I probably wouldnt have been suited to the guy I had a crush on. Although, I did start a friendship with him and we hung out with him sometimes (as did my boyfriend). It seems you dont really know this guy all too well so how could you know? It could be nothing like it was for me, or maybe it could be more if you got closer to him. At the end of the day, it could just be that things need to be improved in your relationship, so think about talking to your bf about things you'd like to change or introduce into your relationship. It's up to you whether or not you tell him about the crush, I told my bf because we're extremely open about everything and I have trust issues so we kinda have to be.

While thats a total invasion of privacy I understand your mums concern. Im 21 for context. I think shes gone too far but consider that a 14 year old having access to a phone probably scares her because of instagram and other apps that can mess up your body image and stuff (and probably to make sure your not sending or receiving and nudes on snapchat)

The main issue I have with this though is that she has access to your camera and microphone. If i were you id probably just turn my phone off. And also you wont feel comfortable chatting to your friends. For example if you have a problem that you want to talk to your friends about, youll have to wait to see them in person because otherwise your mum might be reading/listening.

AmItheAsshole,ey2b7gw,t3_cv7ftk,1566733433.0,"NTA - assuming you weren't intentionally making fun of his height. 
I know that some people believe that if someone wants to do something (e.g smoke) it's their decision, but 1. He asked you to help and 2. I'm guessing you care about him/dont want him to die.
I'm guessing that his insecurity mixed with being on edge without cigarettes made him act out like that.
I'd say give him some time to cool down, and then contact him with an apology and explanation (that you werent making fun of his height, that you dont want him to get cancer etc.)"

relationship_advice,ewu1s9v,t3_cpqji7,1565761013.0,"I would be hurt if my SO did that, maybe I'm too nice but if that happened with my boyfriend, I would be freaking the eff out and googling what to do, even if I was in the middle of something more important, like a work meeting or something. Maybe she didnt know how severe your fear was, or maybe she she thought because it wasnt a bee youd be fine.

And you should carry an epipen?"

My favourite at the moment is Dark (you'll have to read subtitles unless you can understand german)

Other good shows are: Parks and Rec (funny af, similar style to The Office US) Broadchurch (murder mystery), The X Files, Community (funny, random), Secret Diary Of A Call Girl, Regular Show (funny, whacky), The Walking Dead (so effing intense you have to watch)."
relationship_advice,ewnk5ll,t1_ewn747m,1565580630.0,"Hmm, i get why some people are commenting for you to not bother with the relationship, but some people genuinely have bad organisational skills, or have people not turning up to babysit etc. I'd have another chat if she doesnt change soon, just saying how much you like her but not being able to see her/constantly being let down isn't the relationship you want to be in and see how she responds. Maybe ask her if she values the relationship."
relationship_advice,ewn58qe,t1_ewn4cz2,1565568894.0,Did she say why exactly she does this? And does she always cancel or does she just not turn up?
depression,ewn48xu,t3_cp4gga,1565568126.0,"There are apps like Tinder but to make friends, try that!  One of my friend uses it and she said its great to meet new people. I cant remember the name of the app, but im sure you can find some if you search on the internet. I find that meeting people on facebook is hard unless you join volunteering groups or pages where people in the page meet up"
