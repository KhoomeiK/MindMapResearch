depression,fbmk8on,t3_edpkii,1576985028.0,"Anger unlike anything else. I have abused my husband and the only thing that helps is not talking to him until Iâ€™ve contained myself. Iâ€™m so embarrassed of it because itâ€™s always over very simple things. People might see this and ask why, and I donâ€™t know. What I do know is that my grandma killing herself 5 years ago in May doesnâ€™t exactly add to the equation. Iâ€™m so, so angry. Angry enough to blackout on some days, apparently. But even with that, thereâ€™s no excuse. Thatâ€™s the only thing that helps. Iâ€™m responsible for my anger."

relationship_advice,f2a6h7m,t1_f2984ot,1570109231.0,"This is helpful, thank you. I feel as though itâ€™s partially my fault because I agreed to getting married and telling them later, however I didnâ€™t realize that included so many lies. Since then heâ€™s thought of telling them weâ€™re married, but not the actual day of the marriage. (We married in January, so like telling them we got married in October) which is so much worse in my opinion. Anyways, itâ€™s been 10 months and I feel like if he wasnâ€™t ready to tell them about our marriage he shouldnâ€™t have asked me in the first place. You are absolutely right about them disliking me for it, which does makes me nervous but what can I do now? I will definitely see about therapy for him also."
