You aren‚Äôt just trying to change habits for yourself, you are also trying to change habits for the whole system  (ie, your relationship). You already say that if you make changes you‚Äôll have to drag him along. Why? 

Here is a very big question to ask yourself. What do you risk if you make changes for yourself, but he doesn‚Äôt change? Are you worried about destabilising the status quo?   


Stop worrying about improving him for the time being, work on yourself. Then see what happens. Does he step up? Does he resent your success in reshaping your approach to life? Does he respect your personal and reasonable decision to tidy up bit of you life, or does he throw up obstacles? Sometimes you just have to let these things play out."

I bet he makes out like you're the crazy one too, for screaming. And now you feel foolish for screaming. And contrite for screaming. But lets just look back at the context of screaming, a man who forced you to listen to him compliantly for an hour with no breaks. 

This is a really toxic environment. Please stop screaming, because then you lose the high ground. You need to be able to say to him and yourself- ""It is unreasonable that I have to wait an hour to have my say. Please change this or we can not communicate"".

They learn to keep a lid on it, and only let it go when they think there will be no consequences. Thus, abusive people generally keep abuse in intimate relationships.

A really simple question to ask yourself- would he behave like this around colleagues where the consequences of pissing people off are fast and big? probably not. He behaves like this around you because he feels he can get away with it. Stress affects his ability to keep a lid on it, and now you are seeing more and more stuff seep through. 

How someone behaves in stressful situations is a real indicator of their inner personality. And you are seeing something now you didn't know he had in him. Maybe he can change, but why waste a slab of your life helping a grown man realise he can't treat people like crap.

You will read a lot of stuff on the internet about ""suing for parental alienation"" from pissed off parents whose kids no longer want to spend time with them, but it's pretty much empty bullshit, and it simply doesn't hold with kids in their teens. If the kid is able to make up their mind, and not vulnerable, courts listen.

This is your worse case scenario- you refuse to go back to your dads, he gets absolutely furious, threatens all sorts of crap, and you and your mum just absolutely hold your silence, apart from a brief summary of your decision eg ""throwaway no longer feels safe and comfortable in your house. Throwaway says that he/she is open to the possibility of discussions on returning to your house in 6 months time if everyone agrees to go to family counselling."" do not get drawn in, and do not JADE (Justify, argue, defend, explain).

If dad comes to his senses, he backs down and shuts up. If dad doesn't come to his senses, and decides to petition the court to have you return, you and your mum put in a bare minimum, always co-operate with the courts, but just keep repeating the line ""throwaway does not feel safe currently, but is open to returning in the future"". and that is it. The court will interview you, you keep that line in the front of your mind, you say what you want, and because of your age the court will either tell your dad to back off, or simply re-write the court order.

However,  you and your mum need to be strong, hold your position, and not get drawn into whatever bullshit your dad is trying to spin.

I've recently gone through a similar situation with my daughter and her dad. She knew her mind, and we just pushed through. The idea of some how talking her dad around to being reasonable just wasn't going to happen unfortunately.

Have a look at the case of Rocco Ritchie, Madonna's 15 year old son, who got sick of her crap and decided he wanted to live with his dad, and just never went back after a holiday to visit him. Madonna went bat shit crazy and spent millions on lawyers trying to get him to return. But the fact of the matter was, the son was 15, knew what he wanted, and just wasn't having it. It went through the courts, very public, very vicious. Eventually even she backed off, because the court listened to the lad, and told mum to just drop it.

relationships,ewxnlhg,t3_cqkvtg,1565863583.0,"I understand why your fianc√© is doing this. He wants to prioritise the relationship his kid has with his siblings. This isn‚Äôt inherently a bad thing. However juxtapose your mutual decision to abort the pregnancy, and his emotional bailing out his ex, and I see this- A man who has made a conscious decision to divide the two most important women in his life into 2 separate columns; 1 woman makes the babies and the other woman keeps him company. You are in a polygamist relationship and didn‚Äôt know it. 

This isn‚Äôt about affairs or poor choices or anything like that, this is about a man who has decided to keep two different women in his life for different purposes.

If you are okay with this, that‚Äôs fine, but if you are not, it‚Äôs okay to walk away."

TwoXChromosomes,ew3o1s3,t3_cml7yg,1565088513.0,"‚ÄúMy brother‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù is a pretty fucked up way to describe a young mum and her new baby who hasn‚Äôt had a chance to process the trauma she has just been through. 

Honestly reddit could rebrand slavery as a ‚Äúmulti generational race-blind work for accommodation arrangement‚Äù and people would fan-out over the goodness of those involved."

Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it come from somebody who already exists in the margins? It‚Äôs not humility, it's humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore, not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.‚Äù"
ptsd,euosyju,t3_cgzuoe,1563946416.0,"Therapy, therapy, therapy. Recovering from trauma is about resetting what normal is, or discovering it for the first time. 

Being able to effectively identify other people as arseholes, and then being able to swerve them feels like a superpower to me now. It‚Äôs amazing."

sex,et1pd8m,t1_et1ll0f,1562401264.0,"There is nothing wrong with having a single pack of pads on hand somewhere and saying that your sister must have left them there. The idea that someone would curate a collection of menstrual products for the off chance that a lady visitor would have a period emergency on the property is beyond odd.

How often are women coming to this guys house and bleeding unpredictability and uncontrollably that a man needs to plan against the possible annoyance of popping up to the shops?"
sex,et1gq0c,t1_et1e9yf,1562397097.0,"I find it weird, intrusive and creepy. This is A-grade performative ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù stuff. If you want to help out a lady friend in times of period emergency, you do what every decent guy in the last 100 years has done- pop up to the shops on request. 

If I found some sort of menstrual stash with a wide range of products for all preferences, I would nope out so fast."
musictheory,esya54b,t3_c9fbg2,1562340964.0,"It's just a reminder. I've seen this in transcriptions of irish folk music before. The writer, probably not the composer, wants to make the music as accessible to as many people as possible. I am often surprised at how many folk musicians don't understand or recognise key signatures. It is less common now."
