Finding out I’m on the long awaited list of those getting furloughed or laid off due to covid19, and having to help the team prepare letters etc, and then myself being the last meeting for getting the “official” news that I am furloughed. 

Lol."

She screams and screeches and so far I have had to bring her everywhere with me it’s so frustrating. Haven’t figured out a solution yet but just wanted to share my similar situation. 
Best of luck."
