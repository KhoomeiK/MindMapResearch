AskWomen,fqg9qfk,t1_fqdrtbw,1589341045.0,"I‚Äôve come to learn this lesson the hard way. It‚Äôs really clicking for me now how important it is to have hobbies. Even when I start to get sucked into the panic/nagging need for validation I have to sometimes push myself into picking up something and getting lost in it. Put your phone away too! Find something you really enjoy and get lost in it. 

I also used to take things personally but now I give myself a gentle reminder to shift my focus to something more serving than worrying if someone cares about me or not!"

If deep down you‚Äôre hoping to get a certain type of reaction or response back, don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve also found that if you have to think so hard about it and ask for advice on whether or not you should do it, then you probably do care for a certain response and you will feel disappointed if you don‚Äôt get that response.

PersonalFinanceCanada,flgp0sh,t1_flgnfoo,1585147458.0,"I‚Äôm not sure if it passed actually but Ford spoke about it recently and said something along those lines. 

I definitely don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cancelling rent or encouraging people not to pay rent.. but maybe just to take a little pressure off. 

I think during these times landlord and tenant should be willing to work together. There are people who will genuinely maybe need a bit of extra time, and people who will try to take advantage and use it as an excuse. 

But especially for small landlords, it‚Äôs not fair for tenants to think that they are excused from paying at all, even if they may be struggling financially right now."
PersonalFinanceCanada,flgmfag,t1_flglo8g,1585145923.0,"Legislation passed to block landlords from evicting tenants during this time. Landlords are people who are worrying about their bills, just as renters are. We‚Äôre all in this together."

She brought up things I told her about arguments with previous partners of mine and used them against me. She berated my other friendships and said she was my only real friend and that all of the others are fake because they don‚Äôt tell me the things she tells me about myself. She accused me of wanting ‚Äúyes friends‚Äù because I refused to engage in a back and forth text war (that I realized only made things worse, which is why I stopped participating in it) with her when she came at me with walls of text telling me how shitty I am. She accused me of having a bunch of crap qualities overall. She was my closest and longest friendship. The cards are on the table to rekindle the friendship but at this point I‚Äôm thinking the both of us might be better off staying separate. Part of me wonders if she‚Äôs right and if I‚Äôll ever meet women who really love me. I think she must be the only one who really cared and loved me because she put up with my crap qualities.
