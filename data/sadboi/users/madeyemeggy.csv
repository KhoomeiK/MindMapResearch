Important to teach kids that their actions have reactions. Success Academy's approach to discipline? Twelve shades past disturbing. Kids practiced state exams every day for months. If they didn't adhere to the taught structure, they were punished. I was on a PIP because I ""didn't yell enough"".

Anxiety,f24w8r4,t3_dbrb09,1569961436.0,"Hi! I am also SEVERELY phobic of vomiting. And boy, don't I know about the loop (I am a frequent visitor to this sub, r/PanickAttack, and r/emetophobia). 

When I was 21, I had a relentless cycle for months. I couldn't eat anything but buttered toast because my anxiety was causing intestinal difficulty. Then I'd be so hungry, I'd feel nauseous ... which would make me more anxious. Repeat cycle ... for months.

I got out of it. It took some work -- I found a therapist who specialized in phobias and panic disorder. When I was in ""the loop"", I genuinely thought I'd never escape it. I thought it was my life. But it stopped. I am currently medication-free except for as-needed panic attack killers. That being said, the ""loop"" still exists and sometimes comes back so I have a bad few days. However, now I know what it feels like to get out of the loop. I know that it can -- and WILL -- happen. 

The way you wrote your post is very logical. You clearly know why you feel the way you feel (that is nauseous and anxious). I'm the same way (can wax poetic about why I get anxious, but then when I'm in the loop all rationality flies out the window because *fear is a helluva thing!*) What helped for me more than everything else was keeping a journal. The second a panic attack finished, I would write down what triggered me if I could identify a trigger, note what I did to stop it, and write an affirmation (ie. *My stomach hurt so I began to panic, I took a Klonopin and talked myself down from it, therefore it was in my head; I felt nauseous and began to panic, once I was calm I ate something bland and felt a little better, therefore my body was reacting to hunger but I got scared.*) I would read the journal when I felt a panic attack going on. I could see what the cycle looked like in my own handwriting. It didn't fix everything, but it helped. 

If you want to DM me, it sounds like we have very similar patterns of anxiety. I'd be very down to be panic buddies (is that even a thing? Who knows). 

I know this is a super long comment, so let me TL;DR: 

You are identifying that you are going through hell. It will end, even though it feels like it never will. Everything you're feeling -- from physical to mental -- is that rat-bastard Anxiety. The fear will not last forever. Hang in there <3"

It may also be called neurocardiogenic syncope. The **vasovagal**syncope trigger causes your heart rate and blood pressure to drop suddenly."" For me, the vasovagal + my anxiety = some super cute panic attacks at doctor's offices.
