Practicing harm reduction tactics helps me, and also not smoking it. I love to smoke period, so that would not be good for me. My best advice is to KNOW WHEN TO STOP (you prolly don’t know your limits but after you get a feel of how much a small line will make u feel you can cap it off, e.g “I’m only gonna do 4 lines and that’s it, Iplan on going to sleep tomorrow at 11pm”) and DONT go in w the mindset of “I feel great, if I do more I’ll feel even better” you’re just gonna be up longer and the sleep deprivation and change in your sleep schedule is what’s gonna fuck you, if you do it recreationally.

I try to stop that thought and like “bless” it? I tell myself I’m grateful to have a job right now and it’s a bad moment not a bad life. I’m ENFP as hell and sometimes it is fake positivity, that is cliché quotes and corny stuff that makes me laugh at it sometimes, which still puts a smile on my face. You are not the only depressed ENFP though at all, try DBT exercises to combat those thoughts when they happen so you can navigate that feeling.
