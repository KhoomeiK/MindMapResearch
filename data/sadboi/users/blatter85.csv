I had to stop as I did not sleep for a week , well 1-2 hours. I’ve heard that some will be prescribed a sleeping tablet to help with the side effects until they dissipate.  For me that was a no go as I’ve been down the sleeping tablet route and it was not a good experience. Keep an eye on it, if side effects go away great! If not then there are other options. A small amount of Cannabis in my case is effective and Has least side effects (I’m no stoner lol).

I did try bubba kush once (which I believe is high in myrcene) and I seem to remember it helped. That being said I had no idea how to dose.

No resistance to taking multiple meds, in fact I prefer to (currently on 3!), sleep hygiene needs a work over as well. 

I took the requip an hour ago and getting ready for sleep and feeling much better than I did last night. Feeling a little more like it was the gabapentin wearing off.

Hopeful that this  will be a good medication for me, the tingling has gone already so must be working well. The gabapentin still made my legs tingle not sure it’s a good option for me.

Will start taking notes and follow up with my psych (he’s my prescribing doctor atm, but may want to find a GP or a neurologist if this med doesn’t help long term for RLS). I’ll mention the titrating up to him as well.

Thanks for all of the advice :)"
RestlessLegs,fpq697z,t1_fpq0v4d,1588816006.0,"Hi there, thank you for your deliberate and well thought out response. I am currently taking an antidepressant Viibryd which works well, but may be exacerbating the RLS. I stopped the gabapentin last night and replaced with 0.5mg of Requip. I feel it could have been more of the gabapentin withdrawal (initial) as it was helping me sleep , I had only given it three weeks and the doctor titrated me up to 600mg which was too much and led me to be prescribed Requip. 

I was only sleeping tablets before , they Don it really agree with me, I have heard that THC can help with sleep and restlessness, I’m not sure on the research on that but I’m sure it would help with sleep. 

Yes the RLS I have flares up, I take adhd meds and when they wear off my whole body is restless and I get tightening muscles but it’s very apparent I need to move my legs and stretch them and some days the sterching does not help.

I’m hoping that my new diagnosis for RLS (sode diagnosis , from sleep study for sleep apnea) will elongate the need for sleeping tablets as I’ve tried them over the years and I always need more of them to sleep unfortunately. 

I no longer drink alcohol, but I have a stressful job for sure. Would love to see a neurologist vs my GP for RLS.

Now that nearly 24 hours have passed from my first Requip dose my RLS seems to be ok, I think I will try the 0.5mg again and see what happens, hopefully it’s followed by sleep but very hard to miss any more work (missed a day today as could not function due to no sleep and foginess) as I have a very demanding job. 

I have not tried any other meds in combination with Requip or Gabapentin. I’m hoping that less is more. 

Appreciate your advice and any other insight you could offer would be most appreciated. Have a nice evening."

stopdrinking,fpddigw,t3_gcpkpg,1588524855.0,"Your situation sounds very much like mine , especially when I was your age. It’s considered the norm by many, I used to think those that didn’t drink like me were “lame”. You may find out that as you get older you will see a number of your drinking buddies have alcohol issues or worse, it happened to me. They’ve all quit drinking alcohol now and I realised we all drank together because we liked getting that drunk all the time and we considered it normal. Although when I look back we excluded those that did not drink as heavily or as frequently as we did so we made our own little bubble of alcoholism. I had lots of issues with it from depression, anxiety, so doing some really bad things when dunk. 

It definitely loses its appeal , and you become not quite the same drunk you used to be. Kudos to you for looking to take action right away. All o can say is that if you have a moderation problem then it’s almost certain that abstinence is what you’ll need.

I am only 55 days sober yet I have tried to moderate or switch drinks, or my rules around drinking for the past 10 year (I’m 34). 

My best advice is to find an AA home group and attend meetings twice or more a week. Talk to other reformed alcoholics, get some support behind you and a social group that does not drink. In fact lockdown is the perfect time to start your journey as the societal pressures will be off.

Find a strong foundation and move on from there. Find outlets for your stress like meditation and exercise, eat well, find outlets for your alcoholic brain in creative pursuits , hobbies, reading etc.

It will not happen over no guy but take each day as it comes , you will get there. I am still very early in recovery but feeling better and bet r each day.

Another thing my dad was a functional alcoholic and he saw how well I have been and committed I have been to recovery and he’s given up as well he has 45 days under his belt. It’s been amazing.

Feel free to reach out , just make the decision to not drink and the rest will follow.

Take care"
