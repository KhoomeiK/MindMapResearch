WatchPeopleDieInside,fq5oj4k,t1_fq5gmg5,1589112872.0,"Music has not always been sexualised. Remember majority of classical music(and art in general) served a religious purpose. Even now, plenty of more conservative countries will have most songs on their charts dealing with themes to do with love but not sex.

But since sexualisation of music probably directly followed from sex becoming less taboo in the last few centuries, if one criticizes current music for being over-sexualized then they're also indirectly criticizing society becoming less conservative, which is a much wider argument."

KendrickLamar,exo3ws9,t1_exnvu7s,1566469358.0,"tldr; He puts the stories of GKMC and TPAB into a larger context, through the views of history and God.

The following is purely my opinion and I'm open to discussion!

I think from Kendrick's perspective, as heard from FEAR, a large theme in the album was spreading his message of damnation and how people listening can collectively redeem themselves through faith. I am not religious, but I can see that he did try to spread faith through his album. So in a sense, he is acting out his social and religious duty as you said that he has become.

But on an irreligious note, I think DAMN's focus was less on interpreting himself through society's eyes, as in TPAB, but rather interpreting humanity (and himself) through his(influenced by his own life and Christianity's) eyes. Hence the more general titles such as PRIDE, FEAR, LOVE etc. This is in direct contrast with GKMC, where the focus was on Compton, and TPAB, which was him adopting his new-found duties as a voice for the people. So in a way, since the material more general, it might seem he is not addressing relevant sociopolitical issues as in TPAB, but rather he is interpreting them in a more general view, a history of whole of humanity. To elaborate, he is putting the human virtues and vices(love, loyalty, fear, pride, humility etc) as the canvas and paint on which political struggles such as BLM, economic inequality, or racism is found upon, since these problems, at their core, stem from the human soul, and its vices and virtues.

My favorite song is DUCKWORTH and it illustrates theme of fate(how, to some extent, he was not in control of becoming a successful rapper) and cyclic nature of history(the ending of the song repeats goes back to BLOOD). I think like this song, this album is intentionally largely up to interpretation. He is framing the current world, that he has explored in is past albums, in the larger context of history of humanity and his religious interpretations of it."

depression,etmxsdj,t1_etlz5iq,1562971309.0,"It's exactly because you are still blaming then for your troubles that you are staying in this place. Yes, we do have imperfect parents, sometimes shitty ones. You are aware that your overprotective parents have resulted in your lack of ability to take responsibility for yourself, but you only talk about it instead of trying to come out of it. You need to undergo massive change by laying upon your shoulders the burden of your life. That will, I think, free you from the bitterness you feel about whatever fate was put upon you by either your parents, whatever made your parents act that way, or all the sequences of actions in the universe that led to your parents acting that way. You have to equip yourself with autonomy. I know you can."
