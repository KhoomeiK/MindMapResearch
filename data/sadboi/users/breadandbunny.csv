soapmaking,fqs12v5,t1_fqs0kdp,1589596206.0,"I didn't use any fragrances. I'm excited to try essential oils next time. I just did EVOO, extra virgin coconut oil, lye, water, aloe from an aloe leaf. I was terrified this would not turn out well, but I think it's okay! I washed my hands with it today and it lathers well, seems moisturizing too. 

I was using the pineapple puree to see if maybe it creates that soapy sensation, seeing as the bromelain in pineapple causes that sensation when you're just cutting a pineapple. I was thinking it could act as an enzymatic exfoliant, plus the smell of the puree is fantastic. I don't feel that the natural aroma of the pineapple really carried over into the soap, but my mom said she can smell something. Maybe I should have used all of the puree that I had. 

Do you know if there's a pineapple essential oil/fragrance out there that sticks in the soap? I've read that some fragrances don't actually hold well in the end product. I'd greatly appreciate tips of any kind. I'm a newbie."
