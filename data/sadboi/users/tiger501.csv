Thanks for making this audio. Gonna listen to more."

SuicideWatch,f4phl6h,t3_dl9el5,1571731012.0,"I would say I had a good upbringing, but it was not all good. There was unintentional neglect, if that makes sense. Like, my parents assumed I would be good to go if I just ""stayed in school."" Which of course I did. I wasn't a particularly good student, but not the worst. Well behaved at least. 

There was a lack of healthy habits in our family. Particularly when it came to mental health. No one wanted to say they had problems, or if they did, they'd push through it without addressing it. I feel that mentality is one of the reasons why I never get help or follow through with anything. I was forced to praise my parents, never allowed to criticize even the worst things. So I don't care anymore."

Anxiety,f48gw37,t3_djqpv5,1571438990.0,"Nice. This makes me want to try their hot chocolate too.

I always get anxiety ordering something. Oddly enough, I'd rather order in person, rather than over the phone or at a drive through speaker. Of course, I'm more comfortable at places I've been to a lot. But starbucks or any new place I go to is intimidating. 

I haven't ordered at starbucks for many years and I looked at the menu and every item seemed to be one sentence long lol. Tall cold brew coffee with caramel cold foam like what let me just go to sleep."

LushinLace,f2efjei,t3_dcx42c,1570193783.0,"Ah, my favorite duo. I've been really enjoying your voices and when I saw these tags, it seemed perfect for someone like me. 

Listening to this was a treat for different reasons. The script, for making shy guys feel wanted. The performance was very sensual and exciting. The voices are iconic and distinct from each other, giving off their own character, yet both are very eager to please.

Thank you lush for sharing these audios. Thanks to u/MyNameMadeYouSmile for the script and Kilbeggan for editing. Tagging u/JayeWilde."
gonewildaudio,f2eddjt,t3_dcxsxk,1570191806.0,"You turn me on so much, Sass. I don't know what it is, but I listen to your voice and I can just imagine you being in the same room. That's the gwa magic I suppose. 

Sometimes I fantasize/daydream what it would be like if you met me in person. Realistically, I'd be super awkward and very non-sexual. But if we got close, I'd be happy to be in the same room, saying and doing nothing together...lol.

I'm sure, over the years I've said something like this comment already, but here I am again. Thank you for sharing this one on gwa."

mentalhealth,ew0kav0,t3_cm3d5w,1564993128.0,"Thanks for the reminder. Some of my friends self-medicate (thankfully it's legal now), but I still don't like the idea of smoking in general. I've had respiratory problems and hate smoke in general. Also, I dislike peer pressure, so the more someone suggests it, the less I want to do it."
depression,ew0k1en,t3_cm28m0,1564992753.0,My friends are understanding but I feel like I can't talk to them or hang out sometimes. I'll usually decline to hang out if there's new people or some sort of extra social thing attached. I don't like explaining myself to new people. But I guess I can just say the truth.

depression,etw24cz,t3_anh7tv,1563251344.0,"Even though I sleep late and wake up at 11am every day, lately I've had ""better"" sleep experience. Meaning, I have had a dream for each sleep for about 4 nights in a row. 

It's not exactly progress, it's just a reminder of what sleep can do for me. Specifically, what I was able to do when I was on anti-depressants. It would allow me to sleep very regularly and since the quality was better, I was able to dream sometimes. I would wake up and write down whatever dream I had as fast as I could. 

Still struggle. I go on social media less. If I do, I only follow what will make me feel better, like To Write Love On Her Arms, or other mental health related pages. Following people that I think understand mental illness and I can tolerate lol. Holding on for now."

gonewildaudio,eryju0d,t3_c4s93c,1561410169.0,"Really nice first audio, glad you shared it. 

I liked hearing you take charge in the sense that you were on top. Saying things like ""you like it when I move my hips like that?"" is really hot to me lol. Maybe I just like the line of questioning and mental image that can come from describing what you're doing. The l-bombs were nice too."
