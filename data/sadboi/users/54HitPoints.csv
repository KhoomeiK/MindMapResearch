People scroll through so many vids on YouTube. You need to make your vid stand out."

DecidingToBeBetter,fou2002,t3_g9gekh,1588073889.0,Yup. I was jobless for more than half a year in 2019. It just felt so good again to find out that I had a job in 2020 to help fix my life. You gotta do what you gotta do.
