LifeProTips,fqihtl9,t1_fqb83ln,1589396185.0,"When I married my husband we had already lived together for 3 years. I viewed it as a ceremony to celebrate the commitment we already had created organically, not the formation of a NEW commitment. I married the man I knew, not the person I hoped he would become (this is important).

My best advice is don’t worry... don’t even try... to find the right partner. Instead, hang out with the person that you feel the most relaxed around. When you spend more nights at their place than you do at your own (or vice-versa), move in together. If you wanna get married after a year or so, do it. (I have to tell you, our actual wedding changed nothing but the taxes so if you don’t want to do it, I can understand that option too.)

First - Make a dating profile on a dating website. With friends, the risk of making a romantic overture is very high. If your friend isn’t interested in you, then you risk loosing the friend. With a dating website, everyone one knows that romance is the assumed relationship.

Second - if there is a girl who is a friend of yours that you would like to date, ask her to take a look at it and give you advice. Tell her you want to date someone just like her and you want to see if a girl like her would be attracted to your profile. Then tell her that you decided to try this because you are terrible at flirting and terrible at telling if a girl is into you.  Worst cast scenario, you get solid advice on your dating profile. Best case, she says “You are terrible at it, I’ve been flirting with you for years!”"

Spanish has verb tenses we don’t either (well, we don’t change the verb in that tense). English speakers just have to learn WHEN to use them.  I emphasize WHEN because that is ultimately what worked for me. I quit worrying about WHY. 

Scholarly spanish learners are taught tricks of grammar and conjugation to help make the learning process easier, but if you learn it organically, you don’t learn these rules until you have a strong grasp of the language already. The more Spanish I learn, the more I think that the way we learn it in school is putting the cart before the horse. 

Instead of trying to understand why you use por and para, just focus on when.  Memorize por and para phrases that you can use on a regular basis and hope that one day the “why” makes sense.  It may, and it may never make sense. I mean, do you know why it’s correct to get “in the car” but you get “on a boat/train/submarine/airplane”? I don’t (although I do have a theory)."
