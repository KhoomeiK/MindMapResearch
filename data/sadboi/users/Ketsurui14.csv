There are festivals but they're more modern, concerts, normal dances and the like. I haven't really seen much of Poland as a kid, my family was dirt poor and the only reason I know about the traditional stuff is cause we were allowed to go on a summer camp each year for free. Other people had to pay. So we basically had free holidays and were only concerned with what we were going to do and/or eat when out of the house that we stayed in for the summer.
