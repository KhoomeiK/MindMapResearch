SelfHarmScars,ffbnwqi,t3_esgbc9,1579774870.0,"Although I'm not reading any absolute signs of bipolar, maybe you're very depressed and your home situation is very stressful to you? But then again, I don't know you. I hope you figure it out though"
SelfHarmScars,femwg7l,t3_epdvfj,1579271400.0,"I thought that was me at first, I was very confused. We have the same hair. Also, it's impossible to compare struggles because everyone copes differently. I hope you find it in yourself to accept yourself in your battles"

SelfHarmScars,faciz9b,t1_fachqy6,1575940473.0,"Keep the wounded area raised, apply pressure to stop the bleeding and then wrap it up with whatever is close at hand. T-shirts and towels work best for me but it also depends on how heavy the bleeding is. Rinse the wounds with water if you've harmed yourself with something dirty. Apply band aids when the blood has clotted to keep bacteria away."

SelfHarmScars,faae69o,t1_faadw2b,1575907604.0,From what I understand; it's healing. Probably has something to do with the skin trying to renew itself

AMA,fa072rz,t1_fa0497m,1575749868.0,"It's apparently very difficult to diagnose girls, since most of us camouflage our behaviours to fit it. Some ticks and habits might be perceived as ""cute"" or ""quirky"" instead of ""annoying"" and ""loud"". And also shitty therapists/psychologists."

AMA,f9zpmqj,t1_f9zosdn,1575744057.0,"It felt great to finally have some answers. Initially I got diagnosed with BPD, and had that diagnosis for many many years until I got a new therapist back in April. I personally never had any suspicions. But as the process of getting diagnosed went on it got more clear to me that maybe BPD wasn't the right diagnose at all. Thanks for asking!"
depression,ewp669v,t3_cp1ajy,1565634310.0,Oh yeah. Turned out I'm on the spectrum. So many questions answered.
