It is really ignorant to assume all people with mental illness shouldn't have relationships or children or normal lives,but with me this applies in two ways:when you don't treat your illness and when it can be hereditary.I'm a prime example of the first,I have the emotional regulation of a toddler and no desire to change.No one else should be put through living with the person i am now,doesnt mean if it's a romantic,parental,or platonic relationships.And children of people with unmanaged mental illness have it the worst.

And seriously if you have suffered an awful physical or mental illness that you can pass onto your child....why should you put them through it???"
