Snark on caro for a million different things, but people do not have the moral obligation to not work in certain fields just because others are struggling to succeed in them.

We don‚Äôt ask them to acknowledge the struggle of freelancers or to apologize about capitalizing on their brands. 

I think this has a lot more to do with how people feel about sex work, period. We see it as a field for desperate people without options, and roll our eyes at anyone who does it by choice. Equally, I think there‚Äôs a lot more shock in a WHITE, heterosexual, cisgendered person doing it by choice, and I could write pages about what there is to unpack there.

(1) I would say that about sardine oil, right now. If someone said ‚Äúthey put cologne on my shoes so the tigers would kill me‚Äù I would say ‚Äúoh, no, you would need catnip or tuna oil for that‚Äù. She worked with cats, no doubt regularly forcing them to take medication, etc., that was likely covered in something like sardine oil. That comment means nothing. 

(2) The restraining order was unfounded and clearly a tactic that often arises in family law disputes. His own lawyer laughed at it because there was nothing in there that actually justified an order being handed down. Don wanted to divorce Carole. It‚Äôs common in nasty divorces where there‚Äôs a lot of money at stake to try to file orders, tell family members the spouse is crazy, etc etc. 

(3) Who knows. Maybe she needed milk for the cats. Maybe she was involved in whatever drug smuggling Don was involved in, and so was her brother. Both those scenarios are infinitely more likely than her and her brother murdering a grown man, dismembering him, feeding him to tigers, and somehow getting rid of the remaining body parts (tigers are messy eaters). 

It‚Äôs insane. This documentary has cult leaders, pedophiles, domestic abusers, racists, hitmen, drug traffickers, animal traffickers, animal abusers... and everyone is fixated on the one woman involved who was clearly shown in a biased light to fan outrage. Unbelievable.

Edit: and in terms of the ‚Äòin case of disappearance‚Äô clause, she explains that directly in her statement about the documentary.

Parenting,fj6ub2v,t3_fbvb48,1583080324.0,"I think the reason people look down on SAHMs is, like you said, because women who work do everything you do PLUS an 8-hour work day. 

I don‚Äôt think being a SAHM is easy, and I agree that it is a job. However, it is easier than being a mom and working a job on top of it. That‚Äôs an objective fact.

The problem is when we make it a competition. Although it doesn‚Äôt mean you should feel lesser than, you should also never tell a working mom that your life is so difficult... just think about that for a second. Imagine having to juggle a full career along with what you already do. The women who do that are the superheroes. That‚Äôs just the truth. So, while your struggles are valid, it‚Äôs not right to act as if being a SAHM is somehow on par with that level of workload and stress and skill. 

I also think that there are a lot of negative associations with SAHMs in our culture: helicopter parents, leeches, women with no lives of their own, women who turn to drug abuse out of boredom, get financially taken advantage of, join MLMs, etc... most of that comes out of not having an identity other than being a mother. I think if you can find hobbies and that sort of thing to fill your time, you‚Äôll be fine. If not, it‚Äôs sad. 

The point of raising a child is to prepare them for adulthood. If you put yourself in a position where doing so will cause you to lose your sense of identity, there is clearly a wild conflict of interest."

TrueOffMyChest,f1nqxuc,t1_f1nqr0r,1569623910.0,"? Not sure what you‚Äôre talking about. But for the record, I‚Äôm none of those things...which I know for sure, since we have very affordable therapists. üòå"
TrueOffMyChest,f1nqbio,t1_f1nq0my,1569623443.0,"Do you not know how it works? I pay for it. WE pay for it as a society. It is reflective of our social values that money be put into a pot to ensure equitable access to healthcare.

I pay nearly 50% in taxes so that both myself and my neighbor can get help when we need it. I had access to one of the best universities in Canada for pennies because our tuition is also subsidized by that pot. In turn, I‚Äôm happy to give back. Ultimately, Canadians care about the WE, not the ME. That is your problem in America. And you don‚Äôt realize that individually you suffer the worst. 

I‚Äôm sorry for you and I hope it changes."
TrueOffMyChest,f1npy42,t1_f1npne6,1569623161.0,"üòÇüòÇ only in America would people look down on getting regular checkups, free medication, free testing, and free follow ups with specialists. All which, by the way, constitute taking care of yourself.

I hope one day you can open your eyes to the exploitation you‚Äôre suffering."
TrueOffMyChest,f1npchy,t1_f1npa8j,1569622710.0,I literally live in Canada and am a frequent user of the medical system
TrueOffMyChest,f1nhlm7,t1_f1nh05w,1569617462.0,Funny how canada manages it then...
UnsentLetters,f01nzle,t1_f01nst2,1568316906.0,It just feels impossible to stop hoping...
SkincareAddiction,eyvzku4,t1_eyvq8qi,1567516836.0,"Hey! It is honestly pretty great. I usually only use it in the mornings after the gym, so I can‚Äôt really give a full review, but i‚Äôll try. 

Pros: it cleans your face without you feeling like you‚Äôre ‚Äòsqueaky clean‚Äô. The foaming is really nice. It leaves my skin bright and smooth. I don‚Äôt ever break out after using it. 

Cons: unfortunately, I guess I would say oil control. BUT this is really a ymmv situation. I use a really intense acne treatment set at night, so I wake up without a drop of oil. During the day, it obviously accumulates. So, I don‚Äôt want to blame the cleanser- I think I just get a normal amount of oil throughout the day. If you‚Äôre looking for something to banish it (if that exists), it probably wouldn‚Äôt be this."
HaircareScience,eyob3dp,t1_eyo9dhn,1567273395.0,Thank you! It‚Äôs like the commenter above you pointed out- LP seems really hit or miss.
HaircareScience,eyoaztd,t1_eyo96v9,1567273345.0,That‚Äôs the impression I have re: living proof! It seems risky. But then I torture myself if it would be a hit for me...
HaircareScience,eyoattd,t1_eyo4jt8,1567273259.0,Thank you!! Do you think that‚Äôs okay for colored hair?
HaircareScience,eyoas1t,t1_eyo3375,1567273234.0,Omg üòÇ leaving nipple-length up for accountability lol
Anxiety,ey92nja,t1_ey91jav,1566933873.0,"OMG, thank you!! Much appreciated. In a lot of ways it has exacerbated the anxiety, but I keep telling myself it‚Äôll be worth it."
Anxiety,ey92ljq,t1_ey904tj,1566933837.0,Thanks for the response. And congrats on seeing the silver lining! That‚Äôs an awesome mindset.
Anxiety,ey8znrg,t1_ey8y3kr,1566931936.0,"Huh. That makes me feel better too, actually. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through it though. 

Any techniques to make it better? D:"
Anxiety,ey8xjc7,t1_ey8wtlu,1566930569.0,"Same! I was never like this before. I started therapy last year, and although I‚Äôve made so much progress about understanding WHY I feel the way I do, this particular aspext has gotten waay worse. 

Maybe once we realize how it feels to actually be relaxed, we don‚Äôt want to do anything to disturb it?"
crafts,ey62juk,t1_ey620w3,1566845941.0,"Thanks!

The paint is what i‚Äôm a little curious about- i can‚Äôt tell if there‚Äôs a texture from oil paint for the background, or if it really is acrylic!"
AmItheAsshole,exdwhgm,t1_exdw663,1566188972.0,"It‚Äôs actually pretty subtle! One of those things where someone looks refreshed and well-rested, but you can‚Äôt tell exactly why..."
xxfitness,euwzppt,t1_euwzkhc,1564081524.0, Definitely! I‚Äôm booking a gyno apt this week. Just wondering if anyone had experienced this without working out intensely or having very low bodyfat.
