It's going on 6 years and yes, family doesn't get it...and I believe some don't want to...they choose a blind eye, if you will. 
So I have learned to ignore the ones who don't help . I look to friends who are supportive and  doctors who get it and care. 
I include my dad in as many activities as possible. I make sure that...despite his numerous health concerns...he's active and involved...making new friendships and learning new things.
And truthfully, I put my own life on hold...missed some work opportunities, missed sports I enjoy participating in, but I've made the change to care for him. 
Not everyone can be a caregiver...so give yourself a break. If it isn't for you, reach out for help. You may need to place your mom in a facility...and that's ok."

bullying,esdzk9r,t3_c79f0u,1561874597.0,"You go to A. Your academic advisor and switch out of that class into another , if possible for the second semester.
B. You contact campus security. File a complaint.
C. Speak with off-site campus police ( the regular police department in that area) and see if you are able to file a complaint with them as well.
You do not have to put with this.
D. Go to the dean of that department.  If it's happening in the college of engineering for example ...you find out who chairs that department and set up a meeting with him/ her. State your concerns.
With all the violence happening in academic settings, they should take this seriously. 
Additionally, there should be an office that handles concerns of a legal nature for students located either in the Student Union building itself or in the college of law building. 
Don't put up with this inappropriate behavior. If he's doing this to you, he's also doing it to others. Put a stop to it by seeking assistance from authority figures.
** And one VERY important additional thing you must do....You need to sit down and document everything that transpired since this began. Approximate times,dates,location, what was said and physical interactions as well as who was present(as witnesses). When you talk to the different parties I suggested, you'll want this information...in a notebook...with you. Give as much detail as possible so they understand exactly what's happening. Impress upon them that you indeed feel threatened by this individual's words and actions....that way if they try to down play it, they can't. They can't dismiss it if you say these words...""I feel threatened. I feel unsafe. I am reluctant to continue being here and this situation is not right! I expect this college to provide a safe environment for all students.""
If someone asks why you didn't report this sooner, you say, ""When this intially happened, I didn't realize he was serious. However, as time has passed he continued being hostile and agressive. It escalated and then he physically acted out .""  Here you are describing a pattern of abuse and highlighting how it has escalated into something that must be taken seriously.  Your documentation supports your claims."
