IntelligentDesign,fqr5h1m,t1_fqr42mi,1589577953.0,Jesus' death does not mean we all go to heaven. Everyone on earth deserves to go to hell because of their sin. But they must accept Jesus as their Savior in order to go to heaven. Just because you have been forgiven doesnt mean you wont be judged. Everyone will still face Gods judgement. What contradictions? Who doesn't God love? I think you do not have an understanding of the Bible but I'm just answering your questions. I know you do not believe the same as me. You dont have to believe in it for it to be real. I will pray for you tonight. Ezekiel 36:26

IntelligentDesign,fqr1kk0,t1_fqqxhtz,1589575886.0,"You got basically everything wrong. But I can see you are filled with hate and anger. Jesus loves everyone no matter their race, sexual orientation, or how bad of a person they are. Jesus has never murdered anyone. You should read the whole Bible. You will see that these things you believe about God or what you think Christians believe about God is just not true. Jesus' death and resurrection did solve the problem of sin, past, present and future. Jesus loves you regardless of how you feel about Him."
IntelligentDesign,fqqusfu,t1_fqqtvcg,1589572336.0,"Yes. Read Revelation in the Bible. Only God knows exactly when. We are given things to watch out for in the ""last days"" in the Bible, many things that are happening now. I personally believe we are in the last days, that it before the tribulation starts, bc I dont believe that has started yet. But really it could be so close, that's why God says to always be ready. So the important question is for you, if it ended today or tomorrow, where would you go? If you want to go to heaven to spend eternity with God, your Creator, then you must believe that Jesus Christ is God Who came to earth in human form and paid the ultimate sacrifice of death on the cross for the sins of everyone, including you. It is a free gift that cannot be earned by being a good person, because everyone has sinned. But God does not force us to take the gift of eternal life or force us to love Him. If you chose to follow Jesus with your life, then whenever you die, you will be in heaven where life is eternal with God. Hell is eternal death and separation from God."
