BDSMcommunity,fr1bq5z,t3_gm001x,1589816916.0,"I have the same love for spit as your sub. My partner and I would just call it spit play, but I absolutely HAVE to refer to it as a BSDM Baptism now."

BDSMcommunity,fqwyux0,t3_gl3234,1589721596.0,We have designated ‚Äúporch time‚Äù once a week which allows for communication about the dynamic directly. We also always communicate our feelings and thoughts once a scene has finished.

BDSMcommunity,fqwu8sq,t1_fqvueav,1589717776.0,"Yes, I‚Äôve used it and enjoyed it. And we do incorporate pervertibles in our play, just not that time. Honestly, I‚Äôm just quite partial to the feeling of actual cuffs on my body over something like cling wrap but that‚Äôs just me! 

Thanks for the suggestion :)"

BDSMcommunity,fqve879,t1_fqv0z6n,1589675398.0,"That particular night there was no spreader bar involved. That would be absolutely insane if I broke a spreader bar. It was just a sturdy set of cuffs, thigh harness, and chains connecting."

BDSMcommunity,fquanky,t1_fqu85ws,1589655278.0,"Makes sense. 

Do you know of any leg restraints that are particularly durable? We thought this one would be decent and paid a good price for it. I just really do not want to break another one!"
gentlefemdom,fquaap7,t1_fqu7px4,1589655079.0,"As a switch, my partner and I definitely also play while we are both ‚Äúbottoms‚Äù :) Definitely not knocking it, just more speaking about the switch experience as opposed to two true submissives playing. I can definitely see how that experience helped you realize you were a switch! 

I‚Äôm not sure if I would be as satisfied with my relationship and the switch dynamic if I were truly only a submissive. The role could feel forced and ruin the fun. For me, switching incorporates a lot of different dynamics I enjoy at whichever time my partner and I fancy."

gentlefemdom,fpx2zho,t3_gg1u5t,1588974691.0,"Yes!! Let‚Äôs show some love to all different kinds of subs!! I know my partner is a masculine sub and he often feels like he isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù or ‚Äúsubmissive looking‚Äù enough to post on forums such as this. Maybe seeing some more masculine subs would bring him out of the shadows. OH and my cutie has a sick beard. 

xx cheers"
BDSMcommunity,fpwq125,t3_gfkw5o,1588967874.0,"You may want to ask her what specific things turn her on in regard to BDSM and domination. It‚Äôs a huge umbrella and there are lots of ways to play that don‚Äôt involve a penis at all, just depends on what she/you enjoy. 

Maybe ask her how she feels about bondage (rope or handcuffs). You could tie her up/restrain her hands and tease her to your heart‚Äôs content. I personally really like sensory deprivation, so a handy bandana over my eyes and having to be directed by my partner does the trick for putting me into subspace. Take your time when you play and deny her an orgasm until YOU allow. 

These are just my thoughts. You can always look to more kinky porn if none of these ideas work. Open a dialogue about the specifics of what intrigues her about BDSM and work from there. Don‚Äôt be discouraged, there are a LOT of ways to dominate without a penis. Good luck!"
BPD,fpobdco,t1_fpnhv5w,1588781617.0,"Thank you for this comment üôèMania is not a feeling, it is a mental state with specific qualifiers.

BDSMcommunity,fpo4x3n,t3_gddcof,1588778434.0,"Fairly new to this community and lifestyle in general. I‚Äôm more accustomed to a submissive role and I enjoy that role to ‚Äúget off‚Äù, however my partner voiced a desire to explore my dominant side/his submissive side recently. I‚Äôm completely comfortable with this and we have even experimented with it a tad, I‚Äôm just looking for advice on how to transition in the bedroom with this switch dynamic. I find it‚Äôs kind of hard to go from domme to sub and I want to incorporate both in our sexual experiences."

Femdom,fpmlqyt,t1_fpml980,1588735888.0,Okay. Thanks for the insight. I figured this would be the community to post in to get some ideas for the bedroom due to his desires.
Femdom,fpmld0g,t1_fpmkf75,1588735640.0,Thanks for the comment and possible ideas! I think I struggle with **what** exactly to tell him to do sometimes. Nice to have some examples.

Femdom,fpmkurn,t1_fpmkgdr,1588735316.0,"He said he wanted it to be bedroom only and that he didn‚Äôt want it to be something 24/7. Those things I know. 

I‚Äôm not sure what it is based around, but a lot of it seems rooted in pleasure from how he described it. I can ask him these questions. Thank you for the comment."
Femdom,fpmjpai,t1_fpmjloa,1588734568.0,I‚Äôm perfectly comfortable assuming a more dominant role in the bedroom. Thanks for the comment
BPD,fpe393c,t1_fpdyr9o,1588539479.0,"Although there are a plethora of reasons people turn to substance, I see some reasons for correlation with the diagnosis of BPD. 

People with BPD have a general symptom of impulsivity, an increased likelihood to engage in risky behaviors, and a heightened set of emotions which can lead to mood swings. All of these things, in my opinion, can translate into to drug use. Of course there are other factors, but I feel like self medicating and self destructive behavior (risk/impulse) are part of both part of why we see an overlap in drug use and the BPD diagnosis."
BPDlovedones,foyrahs,t3_ga9fw7,1588177721.0,"I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find a success story with this community. A lot of these people here have been hurt by their previous relationship with a pwBPD and this is their space to communicate about that pain. Nothing is wrong with that, I just see a bias in the types of stories you‚Äôll hear and the perspective. 

The truth is, when someone with BPD doesn‚Äôt recognize their mental illness or take accountability for their actions, the relationships in their life will inevitably fall apart. The diagnosis is contingent on an instability of interpersonal relationships, so no wonder. I don‚Äôt think it is fair to say NOBODY can recover and there are NO success stories. That‚Äôs just not true. It takes work to get better, and there are a lot of folks who can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt put that work in for the extended time table this diagnosis requires. However, I know people who have put the work in continually with therapy, who are high functioning, and they are able to learn skills to communicate and navigate life effectively. Personal experience doesn‚Äôt reign supreme, and sometimes the overly negative outlook isn‚Äôt so accurate."
BPD,fovgybl,t1_fovg3h9,1588101137.0,"I posted it both places for a reason .... He is both diagnosed NPD and BPD. Therefore, I do think people here could give sound advice. If he wasn‚Äôt diagnosed with BPD I wouldn‚Äôt have posted it here. I didn‚Äôt get any responses on the NPD subreddit last night when I posted, so I decided to post here in the morning. I‚Äôm sorry if that is problematic to you!"
BPD,fovfano,t1_fovdai4,1588100344.0,I really needed to hear this. Thank you for speaking on your experience. I think I may allow myself to be walked all over far too much and he is taking advantage of that quality.
