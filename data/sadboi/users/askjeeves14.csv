I was just happy to find something that doesn't spit and crackle at me with the regular 0.6 coils. The ceramic also gave me little to no flavor, this is much better.

You may have a point with another company manufacturing them, though, because a few of the ceramic ones I did purchase in the past had messed up bottoms where it touches the connector and would randomly stop registering to the system, as if I had no coil in."

Currently using a 50/50 25mg fruit juice with the extra menthol halo 3mg juice (it doesn't say its percentages anywhere on the package so idk how thin it is)

He basically said all that matters is the level of nicotine and the coil. So now I'm all sorts of confused. It seems like everyone has different opinions.

I think I'm siding with you though, I bet if I put a thicker juice in it would be better. Currently the only thing I have that is thicker is a 35mg juice and Idk if I want to test that out in this machine, it may be too much nicotine.

I'm planning on looking for something in the 12mg range so I can vape as much as I want without getting nicotine headaches, so I'll be sure to find a 70/30 or 60/40 this time.
