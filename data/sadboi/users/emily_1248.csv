Anyways, I wanted to ask you if the surgery affected your flexibility in any way. I used to do contortionist stuff, and I plan to get back into it in the future. Would I be able to bend my back in contortionist positions if I get the surgery? Or even something simple like a bridge?"

Everyone was sitting in the day area, (including me and my mom) and some of the girls were talking to their families and stuff since it was visiting hours. Then out of nowhere, this girl puts a piece of plastic wrap in her mouth (I think she was trying to choke on it). A few nurses were trying to get her to spit it out, but she got up and walked into the hallway. Then she walks into the back room (where the staff goes to do stuff on the computer and handle meds and stuff) because they left the door OPEN. There was about 5-7 staff in there and I couldn’t see if she was trying to hurt them, but like 4 of them had to drag her out. They called a code and got restraints ready for her. They took her to a room (she was still trying to fight off the staff) and had to “booty juice” her."
