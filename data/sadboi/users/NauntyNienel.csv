I'm totally healthy, but I worry about the PC hereditary thing as my mom had been very healthy until pancreatic cancer took her very quickly. 

I know that whenever I go it will be a heavy blow to my nieces, but there's no way getting around it. You and your aunt just need to love each other as hard as you can in the time she has left. That's the one thing you still have power over in a situation that makes everyone feel so powerless. You will be traumatised because the loss of someone you love so much is just plain awful, but in my experience trauma can be dealt with more easily when there are no regrets. When everything between you and the person you lost was good. When you have peace knowing that the person you will lose KNOWS they are deeply loved.

This is going to be a devastating journey, but in a situation like this I always tell people: you are facing the impossible, but you will find that you are going to do it anyway. You will not come out the other side unscathed and unchanged. I wish you and your family love and peace in this time."

Just put a lot of thought into living together because you have a child and your partner's Aspergers WILL have an influence on him.

They disrupted and upset his whole family. He wasn't diagnosed then so everyone treated him like he was a bad person. Both his sister and one brother are also on the spectrum, but they were more quiet about it. 

His family are a major problem because they all have their issues. They love each other so much, but they're bad for each other. We don't live near them and in the past few years we've been actively limiting our time with them. We get a lot of resentment for that, but I'm sticking to my guns.

My biggest issue still (after 16 years of marriage) is that he is very rigid in his thoughts and opinions. His main trigger for a meltdown is when he feels people aren't taking what he says seriously, but when he starts an argument or discussion he becomes very animated and doesn't realise that it sometimes comes across as aggressive. He also doesn't seem to realise that he's equally guilty of not listening to others or accepting of opinions that are different to his.

I deal with this by emailing him about something that is bothering me. He responds much more thoughtfully and calmly in a written correspondence than face to face. 

He is continuously working on himself and that's why I stick by him in the difficult times. He always wants to be a better person and a better husband to me.

He also battles with day to day things like dentist appointments, remembering to take his heart pills etc. I am happy to pick up the slack there. Where he shines is in real crisis times.

First thing - find out what your mom wants and respect that. It's really hard to think of things like funeral policies, life-insurance etc. We thought we had time so we were totally unprepared.

We could have spent those last two days with her running around and doing the practicalities, but we spent it all with her. Just showing her love. Nothing remained unsaid. 

One thing you need to start keeping in mind is end of life care. We had only two days with her at home, but we were four adults and two teenagers and we were physically done. It is harder than you can imagine - it takes an incredible physical and emotional toll. Her caretakers need to do what it takes to cope as well.

beauty,f0r5btz,t3_d679k5,1568874374.0,Made the mistake of going to do my hair with a lady in the same church. It was still the age of perms and I definitely wanted some body because my hair is dead straight. I asked her to use the largest curler. She used the smallest. Now I have a LOT of hair. When she took the curlers out my hair was standing up to the sides. After a week of wearing hats I had enough and she cut my hair into layers and actually ended up looking really nice. When the perm grew out on top I had it straightened again. Last perm ever. But I didn't learn my lesson and kept on going back to her for haircuts. She never gave me what I wanted - SO many old lady hairstyles (I was 25). But I didn't want to offend her by going to someone else because she'd see the changes at church. I guess it turned out okay because I became atheist and stopped going to church. And got the hairstyles I wanted.
AskWomen,f0nyxx7,t3_d5flhd,1568786377.0,It went really well. We actually moved from a city to a small town where we knew no-one and didn't have jobs lined up right after we got married. The first year was difficult because money was very tight until we got jobs so that was stressful. And my husband is on the autism spectrum so was a bit pedantic about he thought I should do things. But we're good at communicating so managed to work through everything. Almost 16 years now and still going strong.
AskReddit,f0hcsbz,t3_d4t795,1568618525.0,"I live in a small town that sits at the bottom of a hill. The hill is sandstone and has a cliff face about 3-5 storeys high. It's a great place for kids to play, there's a small pine forest, nooks and crannies, great views. Unfortunately sandstone gets very crumbly after heavy rains. Three brothers were playing and a massive piece of sandstone came loose and fell on top of the one kid, killing him instantly."

Pancreatic cancer also took her very quickly. At the end we were all with her and she went knowing she was loved.

AspiePartners,ezvl378,t1_ezvcyn6,1568182768.0,"My husband's harshest critics are also his family. And they're all on the spectrum too with very rigid views on how things should be. My husband lashed out a lot when he was younger - he was very disruptive, angry and his outbursts dominated their lives growing up so I can understand that there's some residual resentment even though they do love him very much. He is so much better now and yet they still treat him like the angry little boy who just needs to get his shit together. Yet they don't recognise their own rigidity that upsets him and makes him feel so awful about himself. I've found that (especially in a family context) us ""outsiders"", NT's are way more understanding and supportive than family members who share the same traits."

self,eykwvyw,t3_cxb8r9,1567170434.0,"Honestly - I think I'm a weak individual. My mom was one strong woman - two weeks before dying from pancreatic cancer she was driving herself to the doctor because she didn't want to bother us. My dad was the sweetest, kindest dad in the world, but he was a big worrier. WWII vet. They were honestly good parents and had a wonderful marriage. Yet I always felt inferior, shy, awkward, left-out, different. I always felt invalidated. Whether that was true or not I can't tell you. I mean, my mother never quite ""got"" me or shared my interests, but she was still a good, kind person.

My shrink says it seems like I was always a bit depressed. My insecurities had me make awful choices in the boyfriend department which led to more depression. I grew up, married a great guy, depression got a lot better, but for the past 9 years or so we've been through a lot - lost 3 people to cancer, other serious family issues, crappy work circumstances, financial stress so I've ended up with a pretty severe case of what my doctor termed ""situational"" depression. Back on the pills for me!

I've tried to figure myself out for years, and what I've come up with is that physiologically I am prone to depression. Insecurity and perhaps an anxiety-filtered view that I was weak make the depression kick in - as well as pro-longed stress of course. Not that I care too much about the why anymore, I'm focusing on the ""how the hell do I get out of it"" thing. Luckily anti-depressants, heavy-metal music, baking shows, a good husband and living close to nature seem to be working well for me."
AskReddit,eykfz9j,t3_cx82u8,1567149615.0,"Not too bad. Back on my anti-depressants and it feels like they're kicking in. The anxiety seems to be just an annoying feeling in the pit of my stomach instead of paralysing. 

I feel like I might actually have the energy to do stuff this weekend instead of just sleeping."
AspiePartners,eyg1uag,t3_cwober,1567059616.0,"My Aspie husband definitely doesn't do this. If he has something to tell me that may upset me it drives his stress levels sky high and then he sometimes has a bit of an outburst, but he always tells me.

Whereas my aspie niece is VERY secretive about anything that can cause conflict. Coping mechanisms definitely vary.

I'm lucky because my husband works hard to come to a compromise if an aspie trait affects me negatively. And lucky for him I'm very independent, easy-going and adaptable. So things work very well for us.

It all depends on what YOU are willing to put up with if he refuses to work on things that are hurting you."

costochondritis,ey7nhy3,t3_cvpavt,1566891126.0,"Could be both, but the heartburn definitely sounds like hernia. Before I had my op to repair my hernia, I'd feel a lot of pain in the middle of my back, which I get now from a costo flair up. Burping definitely never helps for my costo."
costochondritis,ey7ncnw,t1_ey5rp3o,1566890921.0,"Weird. My hiatial hernia op was done with a laparoscopy (5 small holes), one night in hospital, one week recovery. Definitely less pain than a bad costo flair up."
AspiePartners,ey7ln5r,t3_cvqp64,1566888600.0,"It's probably both. My husband does the same. He has some real medical issues but uses them to withdraw from responsibilities instead of dealing with them. It's only lately that he's been working on himself  after it finally hitting home the emotional toll it was taking on me. I doubt there is a quick fix. I know it's tempting to rather just deal with everything yourself, but maybe slowly start just not doing certain things, forcing him to pick up the slack.

For example - my husband needed his teeth looked at, but didn't have the emotional energy to go to the dentist. So I just kept on buying him pain pills. That's on me. Until one day I threw a fit when he phoned me during a very busy day at work to please get some more from the pharmacy. He got all huffy, told me to just leave it then and then suffered for the whole weekend. So much so that he ended up making his own dentist appointment. 

Yeah, I know I'm probably co-dependent and an enabler, but I'm trying to stop. One issue at a time.

It's a balancing act and it's difficult to know when to push him to do what is needed or when you have to step in to stop things falling apart. My husband is also a recent diagnosis and I think finally understanding his brain has been instrumental in giving me the kick under the butt I need to get us both to a healthier place. It's easier for me to deal with when I think of it clinically (this is autism and this is how it works) rather than emotionally (my husband is suffering and I need to make it better)."

I was devastated - I mean, I'd done plenty of grisly crime stories, but a missing kid is next level awful. 

Next day I had my day off, the regular crime reporter called me - they'd arrested the dad and found the little boy's body at a rubbish dump. He did it out of revenge for his wife cheating. It still bothers me to this day how I could have felt so much sympathy for this man, I shook his hand, I cried with him. I'm usually very good at picking up when someone is ""off"".

pancreaticcancer,exnlfbs,t3_ctot81,1566458831.0,"There's no way to really plan or to know what to expect. My mom was told 8 months, it ended up being two weeks. Of course it's ideal to have the patient at home, but there will come a time when caring for the patient will take too much of a toll on the family. Every situation differs of course, but remember that the patient may actually feel relieved if they're not being such a heavy burden on the family near the end. Hospices will take care of all the physical needs of the patient and ensure they're as comfortable and pain free as possible. They usually also have resources for family members - grief counselling etc. 

If medical cannabis is legal where you are - that can definitely help with nausea, pain and appetite. 

At the end they will probably need very strong pain medication, but the oncologist will give advice on that - depending on the patient's needs. 

Apart from that I'd suggest getting all their financial affairs in order, funeral wishes etc. Also assisting with friends and family who are perhaps far away and want to visit. It's horrible to have to think about all the things that have to happen once the person has passed, but it's better to organise as much as possible because it doesn't matter if the death is expected, the aftermath is still devastating and draining. Getting all the practical stuff out of the way helps a lot.
