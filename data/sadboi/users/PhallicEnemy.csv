Coronavirus,fo5eia9,t1_fo4bgw1,1587523724.0,"Yeah I was wondering at what capacity restaurants can operate with these guidelines. Some people will stick with takeout and deliveries but the dining room capacity will be way smaller due to social distancing, potentially limiting business and people who can come back to work. Wait till we hear about entire restaurant staffs getting it and spreading it to customers. Social distance is not realistic in a restaurant. Half the people I work with don't even cover their noses with their mask it's ridiculous."
Coronavirus,fo47hk3,t3_g5fw38,1587499512.0,I live in Georgia and have been working around 10 hours at my restaurant that is only doing takeout and deliveries. Restaurants are allowed to completely reopen Monday and I'm super anxious. I'd rather people stay home and stay at reduced hours but I have zero confidence in this state's population. Public mask usage has taken a nose dive recently for some reason.

cripplingalcoholism,fmyr3w1,t1_fmu4ws8,1586493292.0,"Addiction and more specifically alcoholism don't discriminate. Probably a lot of the people posting here are middle class, lower middle class and below because statistically that's who drinks the most. I personally have been in situation where my rent and food more or less has been covered since high school assuming I have been in school, which I have been. I am now unemployed (furloughed technically, sometimes I get a few hours but no more than 10) because I'm a cook and the pandemic has critically hit my industry. Even though I am lucky in that my mom is being lenient on rent, phone, car insurance, and health insurance, I still have debts. I have thousands in tuition and thousands in legal fees for a court case that is looming on May 13 pray to your empty god or whatever for me. For the record I pulled out all of my savings on some drug binge so I have paid for all of my addiction recently. 

Just because someone is better off than you doesn't make their suffering any less valid. I can admit that I have been in a couple of situations where I was unemployed for a couple of months and was given a monthly allowance. It was pretty terrible honestly. I just ended up getting drunk every few hours then passing out for a few hours ad nauseam, I know that not everyone has freedom financially or socially or whatever right now, but I have personally experienced that it's not all that it's cracked up to be. I am diagnosed bipolar and I can tell you that the hundreds of dollars spent on drugs and alcohol never end up in happiness. This last episode it has easily topped 1k, maybe 2k. Oh let's not forget my heroin overdose. I'm still here in my bed drinking wine from the convenience store wondering if my boss will call me off of my 3 hour shift."
cripplingalcoholism,fmynh6o,t3_fxbk4v,1586490516.0,"I remember reading an articile on Bam Margera before his recent relapses and how he used to wake up in the morning and drink purple gatorade and vodka at 11 am and drink it all day. He would drink it all day and that was while he was still skateboarding. I can attest to a certain level of alcohol lowering inhibition without impacting skill while skateboarding but it is a certain apex that is damn near impossible to maintain as an alcoholic. I no longer skateboard but I can confirm that drinking while playing guitar has a similar rise and fall. I play pretty technical metal so eventually you're too drunk and give up.

What's also interesting is that he mentions he had a shit diet mainly of like frozen pizzas. He learned how to puke from some stunt and I'm assuming because of fame and media exposure became obsessed with calories and appearance. Makes me feel better that a couple of years ago I juggled alcoholism and bulimia. I've shaked (shooken, shook?) the bulimia but that's a pretty fucking hard combo on the body."
BipolarReddit,fga343d,t3_exn09y,1580646221.0,"Thanks! I go to AA as well. I have other drug problems, but I have a good group. I'm actually discussion leader tomorrow night. I know some bipolar people at my group but I often feel alone and like most people at the meeting don't understand what it's like. I hate when people say there's highs and lows in sobriety. Like bitch what do you know about highs and lows!?"
bipolar,fdmnye1,t3_em3rqo,1578557392.0,I've been told it peaks sometime in your late twenties and then kinda lessens around 40's and 50's. I'm 22 and only last year was I diagnosed because of enough red flags and family history. So if and when it gets worse for me at least I'll have started meds early. I'm also taking into account when my dad's got bad considering he's the one I got it from.
misanthropy,fdeat9e,t3_eknd39,1578334967.0,"Fellow bipolar misanthrope here. Even before I truly embraced misanthropy, I could never keep friends. I lost a lot because of addiction but also because I can't keep friends for a very long before I ghost them. I have pretty controversial opinions as well. I work and go to school full time so that eliminates a lot of opportunities I have for socializing and gives me a good excuse. I'm also sober in my early 20's and few people I know would be respectful enough not to drink or use around me, but I realize I can't live in a bubble all of my life. I get social anxiety too.

I feel like most people are just a waste of time. They're either going to be shitty and fuck you over, disappear, argue about dumb shit, or just be annoying. I just don't trust them and keep them very distanced. I hate how some people immediately call you a friend even if you've never seen them outside of work. That's not how it works in other countries. They don't care about me so why should I care about them? I kinda feel like an asshole but people need to look in the mirror and stop being delusional worker bees that want everyone to like them. We're a pathetic species, life is meaningless, and you're not special.

A lot of this is psychological but take it how you will."
KitchenConfidential,f6t663p,t1_f6kv55j,1573144545.0,"Our drain on pantry has been clogged for months. We've snaked and plunged there's no hope without a professional. All kinds of shit there eggs, veggies, cake, possibly raw meat. It smells terrible. The one that's a foot away from it is clogged too. If we throw water it just churns up the decomposing stench. I'm  convinced some mutated organism is gonna crawl out of it. Or one of us is going to be patient 0 to some fucked up disease."

stopdrinking,ezw96ko,t1_ezw4rgn,1568211171.0,"Yeah man I had spent a lot my time drinking spitting on AA and recovery as a whole. I had a lot of preconceived notions going in, but I hit 90 days on Friday. I have found so much support in the fellowship. My sponsor is amazing and between AA and CA I have met a lot of supportive friends. That was one of my concerns getting sober, that I wouldn't be able to make friends. Now I realize they weren't real friends anyways."
bipolar,ezk9lji,t3_d148w9,1567957166.0,I work with a girl who's depressed and over the past few months I've shared my illness and severity of past addictions to drugs and alcohol and I've been wondering why I'm sharing any of this with someone I don't even talk to outside of work...oh well
bipolar,ezjbymz,t1_ezi0j9o,1567942164.0,"Same I've been juggling 5 classes and full time work like nothing. I've been vegan on and off for years but I always know something's up when I go back to being vegan, doing yoga, and talking about buddhism. This time I've added AA/CA meetings which I really hope isn't a phase because I love them and they're keeping me sober."
bipolar,eyvtsvg,t1_eyvdwdv,1567511453.0,"Fuck that shit I've struggled with almost every substance at some point but benzos almost did me in. Stealing, lying, cheating, and the funny part is I remember 1% of those couple years.  I kept involuntarily going cold turkey and finally had a seizure. Another time I woke up in the hospital after totaling my car. I fucked over a dealer and was robbed at gunpoint.  Alcohol never did anything like that to my life. 90 days clean and sober on the 13th."
bipolar,eylyjnq,t3_cxcet1,1567195083.0,Life's been pretty good. The lithium and lamotrigine has been working and I'm keeping up with 5 classes while working full time. I'm on my sixth step at AA and CA and coming up on 90 days sober! I've just been doing a lot of self care like diet and excersize and meditation and working on better coping mechanisms. Saving money while still allowing myself fun like concerts.
bipolar,ey5y3wl,t1_ey51ap0,1566843017.0,I feel like I had that the first week. Should be being upped from 300mg today (in the waiting room now) so I'll let you know if it returns.

BipolarReddit,ewsched,t1_ewmwnze,1565724659.0,"Oh for sure. I've failed out of school a few times because of addiction and mental health but I'm determined this time. I have to put the work in for my sobriety program, my mental health (being honest about my symptoms and taking my meds), and doing school work. My life has only improved doing all that so that motivates me. I'm working on healthy coping skills for stress as well."
BipolarReddit,ewixiw2,t1_ewi8h6z,1565458296.0,"Does mental illness make you ineligible for security clearance? My major is cybersecurity and my friend actual knows someone at lockheed who said he could put in a good word for me. I know it's not the same thing, but my illness has never caused me to steal recipes from kitchens with a nondisclosure agreement."
BipolarReddit,ewiwv8u,t1_ewh0o75,1565458004.0,"I have one year left in my cybersecurity associates, I'm really looking forward to getting out of working in kitchens. The stress has been terrible with getting diagnosed and seeking treatment for substance abuse. Juggling sobriety with full time at work and school along with finding the right medication makes me wonder if the work could really be that much more stressful."
bipolar,ew7u7jk,t3_cn4ya9,1565197247.0,I went to a concert last night and wasn't even tempted to drink. I met with my sponsor today and am about to talk to my therapist about needing my meds adjusted. Lamotrigine isn't enough but at least I am able to recognize my symptoms. Gotta work all weekend but I see my doctor on monday so I have high hopes for the next med adjustment. My moods have been shitty being off antidepressants for a month but hopefully lithium can fix that without putting me into a hypomanic adventure.
bipolar,evcwv9a,t3_cj9vyz,1564425040.0,"My doc took me off wellbutrin and prozac so I've just been on lamictal 200mg gabapentin 100mg and hydroxyzine 25mg. She told me to look for any signs of depression or anger and I definitely feel that. I've been feeling apathetic and hopeless sometimes and I've had a few angry outbursts at work when I previously never did. All this with diet, excersise, and hobbies. She said she would add lithium if I had depressive symptoms I just have to make it to the 12th."

bipolar,ergcabc,t3_c1myzu,1560833489.0,My doctor lowered my prozac and wellbutrin further. She increased my lamictal and put me on gabapentin hopefully this helps. The doctor at the hospital suggested depakote but I've heard that and lamictal together further increase the chance of that deadly rash so I was like nah.
bipolar,eq8jv5u,t1_eq3caad,1559866973.0,Same. Decided to put down the bottle when my psych and therapist realized that I was misdiagnosed so that's why the antidepressants weren't enough. Alcohol has been a crutch during much of my cycling and I want to treat it with the right meds instead.
