domesticviolence,esec8ga,t3_c75jm6,1561892612.0,It's been 4 months... And still not able to sleep. Our healing process has not started yet. He is still harassing us. He is making all our relatives question us. No one is willing to try and understand our pain or atleast stop talking to the abuser. They think of our lives as a gossip. I don't care what they think. I'm not going to let them control our lives anymore. They don't help and they don't allow us to take legal help. My mother told them clearly that she is going to give him a divorce and a restraining order. Everyone is asking her to wait and see if he changes. We knew the society is going to give us a hard time if we try to take a stand. Sometimes I think it would have been better if we both just ended our lives quietly. Well nothing is simple. We took a stand and now we will not give up. I don't know when we will be able to to sleep without fear.
Anxiety,es944lv,t3_c6gtvd,1561726689.0,Thank you for posting the tips.. I needed that. It's very effective. It helped me a lot.
raisedbynarcissists,es2ks4x,t3_c5b9zh,1561527972.0,"I hear you... I have a ndad. He basically pushed me into feeling guilty for having needs. I never did anything for myself. Now that I realized it, I don't let him manipulate me. One of the ways to handle this is to tell them your decision instead of asking them for permission. If they refused to give financial support, if you are old enough and educated start with a part time job.
Being independent is something that narcissistic parent will never be able to handle. They stop you from doing anything because they want to control you and they want you to depend on them always. That gives them a kind of superior feeling.
Shouting at them will only make things worse.
So no matter what tell yourself this everyday.
THIS IS MY LIFE AND I WILL LIVE IT UNDER MY TERMS
Just keep one thing in mind.
You know how abuse feels like. So subconsciously you might hurt someone.
Don't let that part of you evolve. Recognize it and help others who are going through this.
Helping others is like helping this world become a better place"
AskReddit,es2j2s3,t3_c5hyh4,1561526157.0,"My mother is a domestic abuse victim. I was emotionally abused by my father. We both managed to get out of that house three months back. He is going to all our relatives and crying in front of them saying he wants his family back. Yesterday he found out where we are and he came to our house and rang the doorbell. He was completely drunk.
He is a narcissist. He abused my mother in every way possible except physical abuse. Because he did not want to get caught.
And people usually think physically hurting a person is abuse. No one understands the emotional trauma we went through.
Now we live in fear that he might kill us. He is threatening that he will kill himself if we don't come back.
We live in this fear now."
raisedbynarcissists,erpbdij,t1_erpbb7t,1561109427.0,I had a suspension that is why we had to escape
raisedbynarcissists,ermun4p,t1_ermt25o,1561037534.0,He called me a failure all my life. I wonder how I am still alive. Thank you for your time. I have to start all over again. Clear the barrier that he put in my mind. I am not going to give up so easily. I don't want to let him control me ever again. He made me live my life according to his terms. I never had the freedom to do anything for myself.
Anxiety,ermmspv,t3_c2nh5g,1561030284.0,I am brought up by a narcissist father and I'm 28f now. Anxiety is like a part of me now.ðŸ˜” It feels good to read something like this. It is really difficult to get through the day. But when I see that there are people who love and support me it means a lot to me.
raisedbynarcissists,ermllmt,t1_ermkrr6,1561028866.0,ðŸ˜Š okay.
raisedbynarcissists,ermj1d6,t1_ermione,1561025347.0,"Thank you for the advice. I will try to communicate with my friends. I wish I knew about Reddit earlier. I completely shut down and stayed away from everything. Now I slowly trying to recover.
Thank you so much."
raisedbynarcissists,ermiw2w,t3_c2kuz2,1561025124.0,"Yes i went through that and I stopped loving myself. My father is a narcissist. I did not know that if I don't love myself no one will be able to love me. I am the only person who can understand me better than anyone. Because of my father I ended up having myself for never being able to make my father proud. Even though I did everything I could. I should have taken care of myself. The truth is I let myself down. I was made to believe that I am a failure. Now that I know what made me stop loving myself, it's hurting me so much. I used to love my father so much. He used to be everything for me. Even though he treated me like that I never blamed him. I'm 28f and I lived under emotional abuse all my life. I don't know if I will ever be able to break all the barrier that he put inside my mind. I must say he is really good at manipulation. And my mother is the only reason I'm still alive. And for that I am not going to give up so easily."
raisedbynarcissists,ermif4j,t1_ermhgy2,1561024411.0,"I appreciate that you are taking time to read and reply. It really means a lot to me.
My pain not something I can explain to my friends. I'm 28f and still I have trouble communicating, that is a barrier that my father put inside my mind, I over think everything and end up not expressing myself because I used to think my needs are not relevant. I did not want my friends to see my pain. Every one had a normal family with a loving father. I always used to ask myself what did I do wrong that my father is always unhappy with me.
My father used to abuse my mother emotionally and sexually. And even though I used to be furious about that, I was not able to do anything about it. He trained me to be guilty always.he is a narcissist. That is what my doctor said. It's going to take me a while to get back to life. I don't find anything interesting. I am trying different things like reading, drawing etc.
My therapist told me I have to get in touch with my inner child. I used to love dance, for more than a decade I stopped doing anything for myself. Now I feel like I am starting my life all over again. My life is an unsolved puzzle, I'm trying to find the Pieaces and then I can put them together."
raisedbynarcissists,ermf7a0,t1_ermeas7,1561019350.0,"Thank you for explaining it, I needed to hear that. Even though I'm getting help I still fall back to that guilt. He made me feel guilty that I was responsible for my brother who was suffering with pneumonia, because we both were in hostel (me in 9th and my brother in 6th grade) he almost died. And my father said I should have been more careful and made sure he was ok every day. That guilt made me destroy myself. I was just alive. Not living. Death felt much easier. The only person kept me alive is my mother. Depression, anxiety and stress. No wonder I don't have any friends who truly understand me. I kept everyone away and always put on a mask ok happiness when I'm with them. They don't know anything because I feel much better pretending. I have the fear that they will judge me. If I open up to them."
raisedbynarcissists,erklm7m,t3_c258ic,1560966152.0,"I agree. I was trained to be not only guilty but ashamed of myself. My father almost succeeded training me to feel guilty all my life. It started at a very young age. Throughout my life so far, now I am 28f, he managed to destroy me. I have problem being myself. It's like he made me believe I'm worthless, stupid.. he always discouraged me and all I wanted was to do something so that he will appreciate me.
In the end it was never enough for him.
I used to punish myself for not being able to make my father proud of me.
I ended up getting health problems, depression, social anxiety. And the main thing is not being able to do the things that I need. Forget about what I want. I used to be unsure about everything. Everything was a big deal, all I could think of was ""what if I messed up and let others down"".
He abused my mother as well. He pushed us to certain extent that ending our life felt much easier. Even though he manipulated me by putting so many barriers. My mother is the only reason I'm still alive. And my brother helped me realize that I need to go to a therapist. Because it is not my fault that my father is never satisfied. It helped me realize how my father made me do everything he wanted and never let me do what I need. 
During this process his abuse kept increasing and insane. So we had to escape from him. Even though my mom told him that she doesn't want to be with him anymore, he is harassing all her relatives.
Meanwhile I am unwinding my barriers, I'm shocked because he put so many.
He made me feel guilty all my life. Now that I realized that it's a barrier, I am questioning everything. I can't do things without over thinking and panicking. Always thinking about how others might interpret what I say and end up not saying it. Feeling that I don't deserve to be happy. I get anxious when ever I feel happy because the immediate thought that I get will be something bad is going to happen.
It's going to take much longer than I thought to acknowledge all the barrier. And each one is making me feel stupid because I did all that without realizing. It makes me angry and sad. I felt guilty all my life for something I did not even do."
depression,erkaunb,t1_erka2j7,1560959339.0,Thank you. Actually my father is harassing us. And it's not helping. Still I will try to do what I can
depression,erk91a8,t1_erjzehr,1560958163.0,"Yes it is not easy. Just when I feel like I figured out one barrier, I find myself questioning everything related to it. And I end up panicking about it. It's so tiring."
socialanxiety,erjwacz,t1_eridr0j,1560948899.0,I pushed away all my friends and making new friends is difficult. I am going through depression and my father is a narcissist. I guess I am going to be alone forever ðŸ˜”
