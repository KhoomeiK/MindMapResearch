Money starts being mass produced and suddenly everyone is high class, because of this, current high class people shoot up to what could be supreme class and lower class lives like Bill Gates. There is so much supply and demand that wars break out and resources become severely limited, the Earth plummets into a condition it's never been in before, fires raging, air that is barely breathable, no more wildlife, the wars lead to constant nuclear waste. Those who could escape leave the Earth, those who don't live among the wreckage in the remnants of the nuclear waste, slowly they evolve and become mutated, barely, recognizable humans and the Earth starts to better. It becomes green and lush again, animals come back and ecosystems recuperate. The humans who escape return after a millennium, but encounter the newly mutated species of human. Another war starts. This time there are no survivors and the human race is eradicated l."
