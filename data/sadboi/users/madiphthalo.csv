I remember my high school chemistry teacher pulling me aside and ask me why I was struggling in her class (I had a 92, for goodness sake!). It wasn't so much that she noticed that I wasn't engaged with the material that she was teaching, but rather an accusation that I was being lazy and not applying myself. The main problem was, she had no idea how to grasp wha she was teaching, so it was hard for her to relay that information to us.

On the teaching side of Abeka, my husband got one of his first teaching jobs at a Christian K-12 school. He got a job as a middle school science teacher, not because he's necessarily qualified for the position, but because they needed a body to fill the spot. According to the pastor-principal they haven't had a science teacher with a degree in science or science education in over a decade. That school was awful to work for, anyway, and my husband left after a short while, but the teaching side of Abeka really is just the student text book with some important concepts pre-highlighted, and answer keys. We worked collaboratively on his lesson plans because I had a better grasp on certain concepts, and he's a good educator, and was able to break down what we had independently researched for lessons into digestible portions for his students. As he was quitting he mentioned to a parent that she might want to consider placing her very bright daughter in a school with a better curriculum so that she could get the education he deserved. The mom went and told the pastor-principal and he threatened my husband with slander and libel. ðŸ™„

Most of what was being taught from the books was so far behind our actual grade levels, that I ended up ""teaching"" a few of the courses my self. That curriculum left me woefully unprepared for college, especially in STEM classes. (In Gen Chem I, for example, I was the only person in my lab that had never written a lab report or done a real experiment.)

Luckily, there were a few decent teachers at my school who realized how pathetic our text books were, and rarely used them.

Target has TP and hand sanitizer. According to an employee I overheard, they have masks in stock as well.  I'm a shipt shopper and that was the first I've seen in weeks of a store in my area having more that 1 or 2 packs of toilet paper left.

No stores have really been super packed that I've been in, with the exception of one Aldi.

We can't afford to eat out much, so I don't know what actual restaurants look like, as far as how packed they are. I went to the beach last week when they reopened and everyone was generally abiding by the social distancing guidelines. I'm sure the police presence had much to do with that. I finally got to return to my coffee shop job and business seems to be picking up, which is nice. Our shop is small, anyway, so it's rarely packed even in non-exceptional times. The community is really supporting us by stopping in, so I appreciate that a lot!

Beef prices have be great! I cooked up a pair of thick, well marbled ribeyes for about $6 each the other day. Pork and chicken prices haven't really seemed to fluctuate all that much, either. Eggs have gotten more pricey, though, but it's been that way for weeks. Seafood is always expensive. Cheaper to just catch it yourself, and the shop I get my shrimp from has had lines wrapped around the building every day for weeks, so it's just not worth it to me.

(Cheap)Vegetable seed packets have been pretty picked over at places like Walmart, Target, and Dollar Tree. Rural King and TSC still usually have them.

Things honestly seem like they're getting back to normal here. My church is holding it's first limited in-person  service tomorrow (you have to make a reservation, so they can keep it at below 25% capacity, which I personally think is stupid-- just continue with all online until you don't have to do that, imho).

So who's to say that the waterbenders didn't migrate from elsewhere to the poles? (I quite honestly don't remember if they were shown in that much detail during the Wan episode).

Furthermore, you can look at other real world analogs  besides Inuit st see darker skin tones. The native Ainu of what is now Japanese archipelago and Russian Pacific islands and coastline are, especially in comparison to modern Japanese, pretty dark skinned, and they certainly live in northern latitudes. 

Mongolians, from whom we figure the Inuit (and all other Native America tribes) live north of the tropics and have a similar skin tone to the water tribe (and Native America tribes, who are also tan skinned and live in Northern latitudes.)

There's not a super huge diversity of skin tone in the ATLA universe, I assuming because the creators based the bations of amalgamations of real life Asian cultures and ethnicities, which is only a small selection of real world skin tones. That being said, the Water Tribe is darker skinned because they are based of peoples and tribes in polar latitudes that are also darker skinned, and without a complete history of human migrations in the ATLA world, we can assume is based on similar mechanics to our own."

muacjdiscussion,foixj9y,t1_foiimfz,1587800421.0,"There's a curly hair product line (Miss Jessie's I think it's called?) that calls their products ""pudding"" and ""jelly roll,"" and I can't bring myself to use them because it makes me want pudding. There's nothing inherently food like about the packaging, but I read pudding and immediately am jonesing for a pack.

Also, not cosmetics related, but this is why I hate cakes shaped like other foods, because if I see a cake shaped like a burger I'm gonna want a burger."

However, a lot of us do shop with coolers and insulated bags to keep frozen and perishables in. If you recieve your order and it's spoiled get credit for your damaged/melted items and get credited for them. Be sure to rate and tip appropriately, as well."

Also for fellow Florida/9b folks, I find anything that grows in Thailand flourishes here, especially in the summer."

ShiptShoppers,fo6qo1j,t1_fo6pi3w,1587564845.0,"Maybe? I know there have been tons of shoppers out the past couple of days. A lot of them are bringing their kids and spouses with them, too.

I typically work the Plant City/Dade City/Zhills areas, and Monday/Tuesday I was able to get around $100 per day. Today there's just nothing. At this point I'd even drive out to Pinellas co. for a decent amount of orders. 

(Sidebar/observation: I really dislike taking orders in the beach areas because the people out there just don't tip! In the rural areas I normally deliver to, I have a 100% tip rate. I truly don't understand why the seemingly wealthier customers don't tip.)"

Yeah, it's awful. Tampa Metro is a huge area, I can't belive we went from hundreds of orders to nothing (currently there are 3 metro orders and I have no offered orders)."
