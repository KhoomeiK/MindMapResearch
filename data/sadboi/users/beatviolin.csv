SuicideWatch,fpqly5i,t3_geu8ar,1588825943.0,Beeen praaaaying that I get corona and die. I keep thinking about the different methods to kill myself and honestly they do frighten me. Also I don't want to leave my family knowing I killed myself. I wish I could somehow die of a natural death. But soon.
SuicideWatch,fkeo29h,t3_fi239r,1584117155.0,That is so kind of you to offer. ðŸ¤— Please take care of yourself and hope your good days continue.
depressionregimens,fhmlgfr,t3_f3xs3p,1581714550.0,"Firstly, I'm so glad you've for the most part been able to fight your depression..that can't have been easy :(. I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes find myself missing my depressive/suicidal thoughts when I've been having too many good days at a time. I'm not sure why myself. It's just such a familiar and comfortable place. I've been doing so great for the last month. Continuously, which is rare. But yeah it's weird but I'm finding myself wanting to go back to that place. I don't understand it myself. But I hope you continue to fight the fight. Goodluck :)"
SuicideWatch,fcllxgh,t3_ehosf3,1577750871.0,Ugh. :( Yes. Constantly on my mind
SuicideWatch,fcg5xht,t1_fcfjv23,1577636791.0,Goodluck to you too. Thanks for taking the time to respond :)
SuicideWatch,fcfi7un,t1_fcfgkod,1577630237.0,Haha. No no. I meant living my life feels like being stuck in a job I don't like. But yeah what you said still applies. Yep have to try and look for a change.
SuicideWatch,fcfe7kx,t1_fcfds2k,1577629046.0,Thanks. It feels like being stuck in a shitty job for the money. It keeps me going but I'm just waiting for the moment when I realise the money just isn't worth it. And to quit.
SuicideWatch,fcfd149,t1_fcfc4ef,1577628791.0,"Hmm. That's a good point. Maybe I just keep on going until I reach that point and maybe I never do. That's not a bad thing either. 

I hate living. God."
SuicideWatch,fcbsruf,t3_egyeqz,1577590563.0,"So so true. Even on my best days, when I genuinely love life and look forward to things to come, I want to kill myself. It just seems so easy and nice."
mentalhealth,fah448q,t3_e94y1v,1576078718.0,Yes. Hundred percent. It is definitely one of the important reasons I don't want children. I won't be able to handle it. I can't be responsible for another life. I already feel so guilty for what my mental health does to my friends and family. I don't want to live a life of guilt. I want the freedom of being able to give in to my illness now and then. Children doesn't grant you that freedom
depression,f94uf6j,t3_e3nsc2,1575103981.0,So often. I'll just be walking feeling perfectly fine and then suddenly it'll hit me like a truck. And I can't stop thinking of ways to die.
SuicideWatch,f928iu0,t3_e39vqb,1575017770.0,THIS! This is exactly what I've come to terms with. Just live. For the sake of it. Not expecting a lot of life. But can't get myself to hurt my parents.
SuicideWatch,f921zt1,t1_f91yer6,1575009219.0,Thank u :) It's been almost a decade since highschool though.
SuicideWatch,f91zfkw,t1_f91xioy,1575006467.0,Thanks. Yeah the idea of my parents just having to deal with that.. also worried about the things they'll find out about me when i die.
depression,f91l5i7,t1_f8vl8fk,1574993376.0,Yeah. I lost a friend as well. I dunno how to deal with it.
mentalhealth,f50mfwp,t3_dmh0gr,1571929626.0,Oh my :( this sounds incredibly scary. Please be safe. You're so strong and incredible for helping this person. Can you find NGOs that can help out with this stuff? Free services?
