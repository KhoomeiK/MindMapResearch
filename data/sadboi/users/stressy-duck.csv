pettyrevenge,fptscpd,t1_fpr61rf,1588897287.0,"Luckily for me, they new and old owners were friends, but my old landlords didn’t feel right not telling me what they planned on doing. They gave me a subtle heads up."
pettyrevenge,fpqm58g,t1_fpqk0qc,1588826083.0,The previous owners and current owners were friends. They told my current landlord and that landlord told me.
pettyrevenge,fpqi4aj,t1_fpqgfbb,1588823325.0,"Sorry, the situation was super confusing- the people buying the condo weren’t friends, and they were for sure going to try and make me pay more. The landlord was not living there, and the people buying the condo did so for their kids (my roommate, who lived in the condo before her parents bought it). My main issue was that I was promised nothing would change, so they lied straight to my face. 

As for the bank, I’m pretty sure they didn’t get approved regardless of my rent but they didn’t have my money to offset the costs, if that makes sense."
pettyrevenge,fpqfy1v,t1_fpq9nau,1588821907.0,"I had really bad luck with roommates almost every year. One smelled so bad (not like BO, like cheese...?) that the entire house stunk for two months after she left."

SuicideWatch,fpq74no,t1_fppfr1x,1588816508.0,"I second this wholeheartedly! That age was an absolute nightmare, and I also felt like my family wouldn’t understand or care about how I felt. It’s unfair that you’re stuck now in quarantine and your options are limited to getting help, but I never sought therapy at that age and I made it through- it’s all about what makes you feel relief. To explain better, don’t focus on “I need to make myself happy”. Instead, break things down into manageable pieces. “I want to be happy” is vague, and it’s hard to make any changes from a statement like that, but just to give you an example, I decided that I needed to stop saying things like “I hate myself” or “I’m not beautiful”. Even if you’re the ugliest person in the world (which I assure you, you’re not) if you can try to stop yourself from saying those things, and replace it with positive statements, you really might notice a change in how you feel. See, it’s not a “fix” but even a little bit better is progress.

In my case, I also had ZERO self esteem. I still don’t think I’m attractive, but I stopped saying things like that to myself. I replace it with things I know are good, and maybe you don’t feel like you have positive qualities, I am certain that we all do! Please, don’t cut your life short before you get the freedom and independence that the later teenage years bring you. As a 13 year old, you’re a bit trapped, since you’re kind of forced to follow house rules and school, etc. Without any privileges you earn with age (like driving). No one can guarantee life gets better, none of us are certain that we won’t experience tragedy or crisis, but please stick around. Every single day is a new chance for something to happen. Hang in there, so many others know and feel your pain, and even though you don’t know me, I genuinely care that you continue to live. One last thing, it’s okay to say that it’s sucks to feel like you do, because it really does. Dont let anyone invalidate that for you! You’re allowed to feel things, no matter what they are."

SuicideWatch,fo3hwad,t3_g5ejp3,1587487181.0,"I always found that there are two types of people: the ones who immediately try to send you to a therapist (even though you’re just trying to reach out for support from a friend in the moment) and then the ones that understand that they may not be able to FIX your problems but they’re gonna sit there and listen to you get it all out, and they make the effort to establish the bridge of trust that it takes to tell people really difficult things. 

Sometimes, suggesting therapy is okay, but directly after someone has confided  in you makes it sound like “yeah that’s not my problem go call someone lmao”"

SuicideWatch,fmn01cg,t3_fvvuxo,1586215387.0,"You have been through so much, and I hope you realize that you are worth SO much more as a person than how you have been treated. So much more. You have a lot of pain to deal with, and you deserve the time to allow that to happen, I’m so sorry that you are trapped with them, though. Please do not ever believe the horrible things they say, they’re cruel people and you don’t for a second deserve an inch of this treatment. I’m thinking about you, as are many others. You are not alone, and you are doing your best."
