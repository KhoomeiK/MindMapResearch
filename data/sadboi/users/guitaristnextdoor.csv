bodymods,fef1iev,t3_eoozs5,1579045974.0,"I had my ears at a 0g for about a year, took them out about 4 months ago for work. They are at about a 6g now, I've had a couple blowouts and I rushed the process a wee bit in the very beginning as an inpatient teen. They don't look the same, but I don't mind. I can still wear dangly earrings without being unhappy with the way they look. I was happy with my 0g ears, and I'll probably get them up to that size again in the future, or maybe even go a little bigger. I would say take your time, and you'll be good at around a 0g, but everyone is different. Hope this helps!"

I am never going back to shaving! I like to bring an extra pair of underwear for after, it's best to wear loose clothing and cotton underwear afterwards."

If you're super open with your feelings, I doubt he'll think an emotional card is weird. Totally up to you though, and I don't know what he's like so I can't say for sure. It sounds like a great gift, hope he likes it! :)"
