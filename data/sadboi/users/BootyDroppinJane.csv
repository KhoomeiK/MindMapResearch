Plenty of people get shot in the head/shoot themselves in the head and don’t die immediately. You hang yourself, you’re more likely to slowly strangle than break your neck. You take pills, your body will likely try to fight before you go under, which will be painful and terrifying.

But you can’t give up on getting help when you haven’t even tried therapy. (I mean of course you can, you can do anything you want. But before giving up on all treatment, you should try the treatment first. Just my 2 cents.)"
FindingFennsGold,f2s3pbb,t3_ddp49j,1570379101.0,"IMO as a treasure lurker (I’m not at all invested in trying to “figure out” the poem or search for the treasure, but I love the lore and people’s passion for the hunt) I think it’s because the poem is not “solveable” in the sense we assume it is. FF has said that the hiding spot is very special to him, so I think we can reasonably assume he’s been there many times in his life. When you’re intimately familiar with a place, you see it differently than someone with fresh eyes. What seems like a unique detail is only unique to you because you already have the place in mind. You’re primed to mentally connect a particular geographic descriptor with the place you most associate it with, so when he looks at his poem he’s like, ‘Duh, it’s obviously describing the spot to a T.’ But for the rest of the world, who hasn’t already seen the place, it’s actually incredibly vague. That’s why people have proposed dozens (or hundreds) of answers to WWWH. You’d have to have already been to the spot to understand the poem IMO. So many minds have poured over maps, theorized for years, and gone BOTG all over the Rockies. If there was ever going to be an “Aha!” moment, it would have happened by now."

lonely,f28w21t,t1_f28b3jd,1570072202.0,"Don’t get me wrong - our attitudes and feelings and thoughts play a big role in our experience...I just think the self-help industry overstates that role. I guess my point isn’t that we’re completely powerless, but that we are mostly powerless. I actually find that strangely comforting. Like it’s something we all have to manage in our own ways, and it’s not some personal curse...if that makes sense. We’re all grappling with trying to have a good life in a world that, for many/most people, gets in the way of that goal. I find it comforting to know that’s not a personal failure of mine or anyone else’s, but something that we’re all trying to figure out for the entire span of our lives. 

The likability thing is harder for me. I used to be very invested in that when I was younger (mostly from intense family pressure to be likable), and it mostly felt inauthentic. Like I was acting, and not being who I was. Which is maybe part of what I mean in this post when I say I think some people are just more difficult to love. It’s harder for me to give up authenticity for the sake of being liked...and I think there are some people for whom the idea of being authentic and NOT being liked is their worst nightmare. I think that latter group, or people who are closer to that end of the pole, have an easier time when dealing with others. Idk I’m kinda rambling at this point.

depression,ez8az2e,t3_d05uh7,1567738486.0,"I dropped out of college twice before returning for the final time and completing my degree at 26. In my first two tries I felt totally out of place and alone and depressed. When I returned for my final two years I really enjoyed college. I was older by that time and knew what I wanted to study, so I made that the focus (instead of all the social stuff) and that allowed me to really enjoy it. I think our cultural expectations around college are unrealistic. You’re supposed to meet your best friends and your future spouse and find something you’re insanely passionate about and if you didn’t find those things, then you didn’t do it right. But I think lots of people get through college without experiencing any of those things. If you were socially awkward or felt like an outsider in high school, that usually doesn’t magically disappear come college. You’re still super young and surrounded by dynamics that are similar to high school in many ways. And even if you were class president in high school, college can be hard. My brother was super popular in high school, didn’t end up going to college until his late twenties, and he made ZERO friends while in college. (He still lived in our hometown and had his old high school friends around on the weekends.) 

Fuck the cultural narrative. College is school.
It’s about LEARNING. If you learned things, then you succeeded at college. Period."
depression,ez89cy4,t3_d01jay,1567737355.0,"I really think the dynamic you’ve outlined is what it means to be depressed. Most people genuinely prefer being fake: Pretending they’re ok, pretending everyone they know is ok, pretending the world is ok. I think one of the distinguishing factors of a depressed person is that we we can’t pretend. I honestly believe that we literally do not have the neurology to gloss over the harsher aspects of living in the way that non-depressed people do. I also believe this is why chronic depression, statistically speaking, rarely improves. What we see and perceive is often RIGHT, but most of the people around us cannot handle the truth of it and so either dismiss it or glide over it. Therefore, we are always left feeling different, damaged, and misunderstood.

The School of Life has a great video on YouTube about how no one ever REALLY gets to know anyone else, because each of us is too unique, idiosyncratic, and self-absorbed to do so. And, even if there are people in the world who really could understand us, it’s mathematically improbable that we would ever meet them. Alain de Botton, philosopher and narrator/co-founder of the School of Life, has said that for the sake of keeping love alive, we cannot be completely honest with people. For those who do not live with depression, this concept is business as usual. For the depressed among us, it is a brutal truth to swallow. I think some of us even kill ourselves over this.

BUT! Something that really stuck with me from that same School of Life video is that in the internet age, we can still find people who understand us. Through creative pursuits, blogs, YouTube videos, Reddit (!), we can realize that there are people who do relate to our way of thinking. We may not ever meet them or be intimate with them, but they exist. In this way, we are not alone. And this is why I love Reddit. 

All that being said, this is still something that makes me depressed. I was just texting with my mom about how I feel like I can never be authentic with people because my thoughts and feelings terrify them. And then I logged on here to feel less alone and saw this post. So thanks for that."

I’ve been hospitalized 3 times in my life for it, and my uncle insists it’s not real and that it’s just me acting like a drama queen. It’s sad, but I have come to understand over the years that that’s to do with his own problems and not mine. A lot of people are uncomfortable with pain, and therefore find people who acknowledge their own pain to be threatening, so they try to invalidate, shame, or dismiss them.

And also, this is the crux of depression: it’s self-replicating. No one would choose depression, but once we are in it, our brains tend to keep us there, since rumination is a symptom of depression! I don’t think you’re dramatic. And if other people make you feel that way, eff em."

SuicideWatch,evxesw5,t3_clr2ul,1564890160.0,"I experienced much of this in high school (minus the gender questioning piece). Practical things that helped me and (might) help you,:

-Find a hobby that gets you engaged and preferably OUT OF THE HOUSE. Literally just to get your mind distracted and get you away from your family
-Try to get decent grades (I know it’s probably hard with everything you’re dealing with) so that you can go to college. Even if you’re not interested in college, it’s a ticket out of your house and out of the place you are now. It can be a stepping stone to freedom.
-If possible, seek counseling at school, online, phone hotlines. Something. Even posting here is a move in the right direction.
-Distract yourself in non-destructive ways. There’s nothing wrong with escaping into books, movies, music, or video games to survive. You gotta do what you gotta do.
-Remember that once you’re an adult, you will have more options than when you’re under a shitty parent’s roof. Let that be the carrot on the stick to keep you going if nothing else can. 

And if nothing else, keep posting here when you’re feeling overwhelmed. I’m not gonna say life becomes a Disney movie but I truly believe if you can make it through high school and get away from your family and town, you stand a damn good chance at having a much better life than you do now."

I’m 32 and feeling this way. I guess it’s a question of...too late for what? We get ideas fixed in our minds of how we should be, how life should be, and I think that can really spiral us into this kind of thought process. I sometimes try (not always successfully) to tell myself that the only real task I have in this life is to experience whatever comes my way. Having a super fluid “purpose” like that helps ease the pressure sometimes.

And as others have noted - life only gets better after high school. I can also vouch for this. For many of us, the middle school - high school years aren’t all that great - for some they’re even the worst years of our lives! You have a lot to look forward to now that you’re nearing the end of high school!

depression,evwjpdh,t3_clhszv,1564865834.0,"That’s because we live in a culture that fetishizes “fixes” when in reality, some things cannot be overcome - just managed. Chronic depression is a great example of this. I remember the comedian and writer Andy Richter once referred to his depression as a bad back: not something that can be cured or will ever go away, but it’s something he can manage over the course of his life via therapy, medication, etc. There are many things in life we cannot change or “defeat” or “fix.” We are each just one of several billion organisms on this planet. Our sphere of influence is microscopically small. And that’s ok. That’s life, for all of us. We can do our best to make our lives or the world “better” but we won’t always succeed. And (in my experience) the key is allowing ourselves to become ok with that. 

Acceptance is the answer to many/most things in life. Hard work and self-improvement fixes have their limits.  Life isn’t supposed to be a string of successes and nonstop positive emotions. It also includes failures and emotional pain. And that’s just part of it.  That doesn’t mean one has failed or given up or not tried their hardest. It simply means they have lived.
