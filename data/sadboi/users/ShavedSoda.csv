DestinyTheGame,fdf8044,t1_fdec0z2,1578355430.0,"I feel the exact same way. You do get a small buff to all stats on the armor piece but those don't really add up until you masterwork all of your armor. Not to mention, if you ever find better armor, it was just a waste of materials. It's way too much of a grind considering the benefits. But if I were able to use them as ornaments, then I could see it being much more useful. I know Bungie is reluctant to make old armor ornaments cuz it could take away from the value of Eververse but masterworking isn't easy so I think that this could be a sort of compromise. This way you can either grind for it or buy it straight out."

Don’t get me wrong, I actually enjoy destiny’s PVP (at least to an extent). But rather than switch around and play a variety of different modes and games, I am forced to do the same control shit over and over. Fine whatever. Some of the stuff in destiny is a grind. But wait a minute. Hold up. Bungie said, “what if we make them do a pointless quest to make them play this gamemode even longer so that they can turn in their tokens. And how about we don’t add anything new to the loot pool.” They need to rework it so that there are a wider variety of things to do and things to earn. I never understood why the didn’t make IB across all crucible game modes so that we would just grab bounties from Saladin and then play any crucible games we wanted. And then certain bounties and quests would drop certain pinnacle armor pieces. It would just make IB more fun."

It’s a huge pain in the ass and I don’t see why Bungie needs to add it. If they are gonna do it, at least make it easy to complete. Iron Banner is only around for short periods of time so it would be kinda nice to be able to actually cash in our tokens. This I especially annoying because I will be on vacation until the day before reset so I’m basically only getting one night to grind out iron banner.

The master chief collection is great, the new CoD is solid, and if you want some good story games I suggest the Bioshock franchise, Nier, and the Witcher 3.

Edit: I’d also like to add that there is so much to do in the new season for just ten bucks. Again, if it ain’t your cup of tea don’t bother. But I seriously think that if you enjoy destiny’s gameplay it’s worthwhile."
DestinyTheGame,fbwjw97,t1_fbwjh0k,1577151871.0,"I can see where you’re coming from but the sundial, crucible changes, buffs and nerfs, as well as the new lore and story missions have made this season pretty unique.
