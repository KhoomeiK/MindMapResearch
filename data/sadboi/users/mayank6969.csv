Let's start with loving yourself and by loving yourself means eat healthy and try to hit the gym ik it's pretty much hard cuz I am trying to do that for last 3 weeks and failing but m still trying so if you like you can do some running or something. And best of luck man!
depression,eylhj6s,t3_cxjp3o,1567184617.0,Nothing is wrong with you mate.. maybe we're just so habitual of facing sh*t everyday that we don't even remember how to react if something nice happens to us.
