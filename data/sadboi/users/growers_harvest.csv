1 browsing this sub for positivity stories and contributing to support others. This gives me hope and the feeling that being sober is essentially something to be happy and grateful for

2 being more actively creative in my time, eg. writing poems about drinking/ sobriety. Drawing too (I illustrate quotes that resonate with me). Choosing to be open-minded to the possibility you can like being sober and build a better life

3 the meta realisation that I can find more meaning as opposed to meaninglessness in my life by being someone who is actually present for the whole of its peaks and troughs in a real way. This helps me endure eg. boredom better

4 the realisation that I can view myself in a detached way as a person entrusted to me to take care of, as if I was someone else, viewing that self as a person who can thrive significantly better if not actively fucked up by my choices. Gives me better perspective and motivation

5 the black and white recognition that lifting a drink takes me down 'the bad path' to likely death

5 the knowledge that it feels Good when I tap into gratitude for sober living and live it. I can be positive, appreciative, interested and content. I want to recapture that"

Revisit something you used to enjoy out of curiosity.

Contribute on this sub and give your own advice, it gets your brain turning things over positively and puts you more in touch with your own strength and source of power.

Try out written meditation (just write out a stream of consciousness of your feelings, sensations and impulses, keep it basic and simple and not overthought). This can be very good for getting distractions or annoyances off your chest and finding more focus and inspirations.

List little things you are grateful for (these can also come to the surface with more clarity when you try out written meditation)

selfimprovement,fiki3hr,t3_f89mzu,1582480770.0,"Ahhhhhh I strongly empathise. I'm in the same shitty boat. I'm not sure what to suggest for you, I started a terrible day drinking habit to help deal with some of my symptoms 9 years ago aged 21 and am currently fighting that. As the initially constructive habit degenerated and I became an all day everyday drinker with the problems that come with that. Presently doing alright for today. Just watch yourself (not meaning to suggest you're as stupid as me). I can suggest trying to find a passion (helps with ADD focus, quality of life and these will happily occasionally pop up in life) or getting a job with a lot of social support and externally imposed structure. I do understand completely, also being a compulsively unfocused/ hyperfocused daydreamer with other features you mention. I got through school fine but substantial independent study I cannot handle.

I'm currently technically unemployed but I help manage a online mental health/ arts non-profit voluntarily. My working style is erratic, but it's a fantastic cause with a lot of checking-in with other folk which helps keep me somewhat on track. I also vaguely aspire to getting involved with an addiction service as a peer support if I can kick the drinking problem. 

So yeah, just try to focus on getting and developing value from the little things in life, finding little intriguing ways to engage your mind like journaling, being kind to others on reddit or something creative which can be grounding, trying out some new things, cultivating gratitude when you can and finding personalised ways to contribute that engage you. Things you can't do, many? Things you can do - many. This will help immensely and it is very appealing to people in spite of your perceived limitations.

My percentage of time spent sober is right now at an all time high and I've learned a lot about the good life, for which I'm so enthusiastically grateful and also just for feeling well.
