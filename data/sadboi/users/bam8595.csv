It gives Franklin the opportunity to dig deep into why our secondary was our weak point this year.  Maybe it's because they coach safeties and cornerbacks separately, which honestly seems like a bad idea to me. Either way I like that it was exposed (again) so it can be addressed in the off-season."

I've seen an offense struggle for 2 years, even this year I was excited to see what Rahne would do. However if you can name three things our offensive executed well during the first, second and, fourth quarter I'll take back what I said. I understand having stability. I'm tired of being stable at second. We need to make changes if we ever expect to be at the top of the big ten. I've consistently watched Ronnie fuck up our offense for the past two years. I'm tired of it. I don't expect perfection, but I do expect improvement, especially after the speeches Franklin gives."
