I know how bad you want to be able to take all that pain and hurt away from her but you need to let go of that past. Shes with you now and you have the ability to be an excellent support for her and help her create a happy and safe environment.

She doesn't need to dwell on it. She needs to process it. She needs to understand the damage it has done to her. And she needs to learn ways to heal. All you can do is provide the space for her to be able to heal, getting angry and bitter is totally understandable. Its not a fair situation and someone you love has had something foul happen to them, but being angry and bitter isn't going to help her right now.

ukpolitics,fnve47q,t1_fnvdg4v,1587289863.0,"Because the sheer governmental incompetence and disregard for human lives at the way testing has been handled, echoes through literally most of the decisions the Torys have made since theyve been in power. 


The mishandling of the way covid testing has been implemented isn't a mistake under a stressful situation. It shows me just how little this government cares about its vulnerable. And how little effort they feel like putting in to help the people we need to be protecting.

Also I completely agree with testing being central. We need to pull our resources and work together. 

It's not that I'm against the entire idea of the union. I'm pro EU and its basically the same idea on a smaller scale. It's the way the union has continued to fail the devolved powers and the north of England constantly. For me the only way out of this is to completely separate from Westminster. Its literally designed to fail our working classes and serves the rich. That's not an institution that I feel comfortable being in control of my public services."
ukpolitics,fnvc44x,t1_fnv97yv,1587287701.0,"Yes health care is devolved. But as you'll see the English NHS has completely buckled because of lack of funding and policy support.

I'm not happy with the response, because I'm a human before I am Scottish. Just because the English nhs hasn't failed me directly doesn't mean I hold any less contempt for blatant government failures that have led to thousands of unnecessary deaths. With literally hundreds of thousands expected to follow.

The NHS is failing its patients, not because of lack of will from its staff. Weve seen how dedicated and amazing theyve all been. A pregnant nurse died when her baby was at 8 months along. The baby only survived because if emergency surgery. She never even got to see or hold her baby. Her sacrifice should not have been allowed to happen. 

This lockdown should have been implemented harder and sooner. We had the Intel we had the means. This should not have been allowed to continue as other countries were shutting down weeks before us.

Private jets still fly in to the uk from covid hot spots without testing. 

Theyve failed us on testing entirely. 

Theyve failed our poor. Old. Disabled. Mentally ill. They. Have. Failed.

And yet no pay rises have been implemented. No hazard pay laws put in place. PPE has ran out.

This is about a decades worth of cuts to the NHS, pleas from nurses and doctors begging for more funding falling on deaf ears. 

This is a complete disregard for the under paid and horrid conditions our ""low skilled"", oh wait I mean essential workers, have to work in.

This is about gutting vulnerable people of dignity and forcing them to live on Â£93 a week. And to make matters worse, creating and breeding contempt and shame around our benefit services. For years.

This is about food banks increasing by the thousands. Leaving Bulk Buying rendering our at most vulnerable in society to struggle even further.

I dont think no contact is the best step for us. I'm no contact with my family because I was brought up in a very abusive home.

He has been such a good part of my life, even recently when things relationship wise havent. 

His family are now my family and we all love each other deeply. That's why it's been so hard for me to not ask how he is doing.

Theres no situation where you should be responsible for ""just pushing through it"" at the expense of your MH.

I think that's probably a response you've built up as a reaction to not being able to take up any emotional space as a child when your mum has been unloading on you inappropriately. You've probably grew up not knowing when is the right time to stop cutting off parts of yourself for the sake of your family and that's why you feel so uncomfortable at the idea of stopping this behaviour. But I can guarantee you dont have to sacrifice your happiness or mental health for anyone. Even family.

Take the time you have now to reflect on how you would feel if you went compared to how you would feel if you didnt. I'm guessing neither option is easy, but its much easier to recover from the hurt they caused from afar rather than enduring it daily throughout the holidays.

I hope she gets better, bpd relapses are honestly so terrifying and confusing it is a shame for her. But I do think itll be good for her to learn to pull through it on her own, independence is so important to people with bpd regaining stability.

It's a shame that you've had to second guess your feelings because you dont feel they're worth what reaction they might have gotten. My best advice is to use this time to relearn how to take up emotional  space again. You deserve it."
BPD,f8gtnha,t3_e0sn7q,1574564916.0,"For me when I'm splitting I always kinda know but I dont fully acknowledge it untill I'm over that hump if that makes any sense.

For example I was splitting really bad on my bf a while ago and i thought he was gaslighying me etc. A part of me always questioned it but I felt so sure that these feelings were real because they were so strong.

It's as if the rational and the bpd are shouting two different things and sometimes the rational is louder and sometimes the bpd is louder.

So theres every chance that she feels the same, and is left questioning which part is real and what's made up because her MH.

With regards to her saying she feels relieved after the breakup  I fully understand it. Whenever I feel my self splitting, even if it's not on my bf, I want to break up with him. You feel so out of control and responsible for everyone's feelings that you want to save this person from the grief of what you might do next. You want to protect them and yourself because you just dont know what to do next. 

I dont know how she feels but I can definitely understand a situation where she has split on you, knows shes in the wrong for the way she has treated you and happy you've broken up.

Keep in mind that your not responsible for her emotional reactions and deserve to be happy. You dont have to sacrifice that to be with her. Her bpd is an explanation but not an excuse for hurting you."

AmItheAsshole,f5tkm2k,t1_f5tjwr1,1572460506.0,"I'm saying I would complain about the actual issues. 

Like, why do you expect me to pay more for a night out when we as a group could go somewhere a bit more fair. Somewhere we all feel comfortable. Your obviously not comfortable paying more so just say that. If all my friends wanted to go somewhere that let them in for free just cause they were guys I'd be more careful to see what kind of women they might go home with, since these are women that might be more creepy and less respectful of consent or boundaries- if roles were reversed. I would also maybe just not go if it was that much of a problem

AmItheAsshole,f5tjhmb,t1_f5tilqc,1572459916.0,"So you think that moaning about having to pay for drinks, that you would otherwise have to pay for anyways, is discrimination because women are lured into night clubs by ""ladies nights"" to be treated like commodities, to be objectified and sometimes harassed and sexually assaulted. You think that its sexist against men to pay for there shit? And to have the privilege of doing it without harassment just because of your gender. What are you not getting? How can u see my points and still feel like your falling short.

There is so much more important, real, sexist issues that effect men. Male suicide rates. Poor mental health in teenage boys and young men. Effects of violent culture. Toxic masculinity. Under representation is some industry's. Sexist stigmas. Under representation when it comes to domestic and sexual abuse.

Why the fuck is this the thing you care about? Or do you actually care about over coming sexism and just want to bitch"

AmItheAsshole,f5ti7s1,t1_f5thfe7,1572459200.0,"And what I'm saying is, taking advantage of a system that's been put in place to help people live more comfortably in society is morally a bit shit. Just because it's legal, doesn't mean its moral. Just because this system exists, doesn't mean you have to manipulate it for your own benefit. 

And your talking about wanting equal advantages as women at might clubs as if it's even an issue.

Rape culture and night clubs so often go hand in hand.

Sexism obviously effects men too, but going on a night out as a women can be really scary. These ladies nights are a hot bed for creeps that want to go out and pray on women, so whilst your crying your poor little tears that you have to pay for the drinks you order have some sympathy for the women out there that are treated as pray and a bit of meat. Women may receive a economical benefit from ladies nights but we fall short on safety and security.

Check your privilege."
AmItheAsshole,f5th2jz,t3_dpa43a,1572458478.0,"YWBTA-

In my opinion this is taking advantage of a system that's been in place for people who are trans and more generally gender non conforming people. Issues surrounding gender identity are still widely not recieving enough respect. Changing your identity legally for a lot of trans people is a huge step, emotionally draining in a lot of cases, not to forget a massive achievement and something to be celebrated.

Personally I believe if you had to go through the process of changing your legal gender for free club entry it kind of shows a lack of empathy and understanding for those who have had to work hard and struggle for this to even be an option for those who need it most. 

Think along the lines of ""I'm a trans person who has reached a huge personal milestone by finally changing my legal gender, after prolonged periods of dysmporphia, over coming social stigma, and coming to terms with my identity- it may have cost me my job, family and friends a long the way"" to ""I want free club entry so I made myself a legal women, who wants shots?"""

However, YTA because this is having a direct effect on your bfs health. And a rash isn't good for anyone confidence either. You cant sacrifice his health and self image because of something you feel uncomfortable with.

I say this understanding it's not an easy step for you but this could be a really great step for both you and your relationship. By making the leap for him by doing something that you find difficult and daunting it shows him that for you, he is worth this sacrifice. He should  be able to appreciate you making this choice because it's very clearly something you've struggled with.

It will also be a really healthy move forward for yourself as well. Makeup is obviously good for helping you feel comfortable within yourself however you dont want it to be a crutch. If you can learn to need it less itll have a healthier place in your life."

Recently I had a flatmate introduce me to a friend of hers and the entire time he was there I just got this uncomfortable feeling that he was a shitty person. I later found out he said to her bf, ""I dont like being around liltooter because she makes me feel like she can see right through to my soul and see all the bad things I've done, she scares me"". 

I'm ngl I'm not much to be scared of and I'm very much a people pleaser sometimes so it's not like I give that impression off naturally. Or maybe I do I dont know. But its weird we both thought there was something unpleasant I was seeing in him."

As someone with PTSD this is a bit infuriating to hear. I understand that not everyone experiences it in the same way or even has the same symptoms- however it's very annoying to think people can just slap a label on cruel behaviour and others to be all like ""it's okay shes a bit loopy it's the PTSD let's just move along"" like nope that behaviour is cruel and if you condone it under the guise of supporting PTSD your only making it harder for genuine symptoms to be understood.

BPD,f2d1c3a,t3_dcttzq,1570145497.0,"I fully get this. 

I've not long left a job that I split on. And I'm currently working 2 because the idea of committing to one is terrifying. That helped me a lot, the idea of having some control. A safety net kind of idea.

What I've done is work 15hrs in a job that I'm passionate about, something that motivates me and then I make up the rest of my hours with agency work. Something that let's me choose my availability. So if I take a dip I can just not put in my availability that week and take more time for myself, or if I'm ready to throw myself into it I have the ability to do that as well.

I think with BPD the idea of losing everything is terrifying, if you lose this job your fucked plays through your mind a lot more. But if you feel like you have more control that might help.

Then again we're all different and we all have different solutions to these things, theres nothing wrong if you dont think this will work for you. Regarding your current state, it's all going to be okay and BPD makes everything feel so much more high risk. Theres nothing wrong with leaving environments that dont create a healthy space for you and theres nothing wrong with being off work when you feel this way. 

Your still learning and your still adapting to BPD, your time will come when these are just bygone worries and its just a bad memory that pops up every so often. If u need someone to talk to my DMs are open x"
BPD,f2cv081,t1_f2clhsq,1570143139.0,Maybe the concept of a FP but theres nothing wrong with accepting that and working on it to make it healthy. Any relationship is salvagable if both persons work hard and are open to the necessary changes fo make it healthy
BPD,f2culqa,t3_dct0cy,1570142942.0,"I think its definitely possible. Even ""healthy"" relationships have issues they have to be aware of and keep an eye on. Like yeah BPD makes it harder, and if they are your FP then the chances of it being unhealthy is likely but to say it can never be healthy is too generalised. 

With my FP the relationship with definitely unhealthy at times, co dependency and constant need of approval and support made it hard for the relationship to be balanced. But when we realised it was unhealthy we worked hard to address the issues. 

Being aware of the problems and being open to fixing them is what makes a relationship healthy, having BPD and having a FP doesn't mean your friendship/ relationship/ what ever capacity your care for each other, is inherently wrong and doomed. It just means you have to work a bit harder and be open to the idea of going through the processes to make it healthy and work for both people. I'm glad you've found someone that makes you feel this way and keep working on it!!!"
