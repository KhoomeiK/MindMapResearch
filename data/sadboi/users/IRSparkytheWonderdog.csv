depression,feyc0h6,t3_eqs4h8,1579443525.0,"Saying "" suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem "" isn't pretending depression has a cure, and it's not a promise that your life will be nothing but sunshine and unicorns some day.  You have shitty days, and you have good ones.  It's acknowledging that nothing is changeless.  Some days I wake up happy to be alive, others with the knowledge that my dog is counting on me the only thing that keeps me going.  A good psychologist and medical management helps.  NOBODY is worthless, and the only thing that is forever is death.  If you aren't already doing so, I urge you to get professional help in coping with your depression, and learn to take joy in little things - for instance, when I get severely depressed, I treat myself to sushi.  It ain't much, but it's something I love and so it's like a little gift to myself - and sometimes it's enough to help me carry on."

One of our stations had the unenviable duty of responding to suicides off the Golden Gate Bridge.  Only about 1 in 20 survives the jump, so usually it becomes a body recovery mission.  One night, however, it wasn't.  When the boat crew pulled the kid aboard, the first words out of his mouth were ""As soon as my hands left the rail, I knew I had just made the biggest mistake of my life, and all I could think while I was falling was 'Please give me a second chance.""  That has resonated with me ever since when times got hard.  


This isn't the kid we pulled out of the water that night, but this guy had a similar experience.  He's worth a listen.

I don't even know where to begin.   First, that's the home your wife grew up in.  So long as she lives there, it will ALWAYS be HER home.  Doesn't matter if your name is on the deed.  You wouldn't be living there if HER parents didn't agree to a lease-to-purchase plan with HER and HER husband.  Second, if she feels it would be taking on too much debt, and you can't convince her otherwise, then YOU'RE TAKING ON TOO MUCH DEBT.  She's not your child, she's your wife and partner.  She gets equal say in major purchases (I don't care if you're the ONLY breadwinner - that's the deal you made when you married her.), and unless the decision to go forward with one is unanimous, she wins.  If you go ahead with this purchase, the only thing you'll accomplish is spending a lot of money to tell your wife that you don't give a shit about how she feels, and that you don't value her as a life partner.  


My advice:  Cancel that check, and take your kids to the community pool, until such time as she might change her mind.  Also, be careful sitting down so that it doesn't drive that stick up your ass any further.  


Or, you could just blow this off, get the pool, and live with the consequences.  But I'm sure they won't be pretty."
