GeForceNOW,fj9iszl,t3_fc9qkr,1583150097.0,Damn. I was really hoping to play this morning before work!
dauntless,f1jy1b8,t3_d9nahj,1569529377.0,Oh most definitely! Huge fan of the Mon Hunting genre and this game is amazing! Easy to pick up and it gets challenging after a while. Hunt Pass is definitely worth it for cosmetics. Even if you don't purchase the Hunt Pass you still get some pretty cool things via the free track!
PokemonMasters,eyrtk0j,t3_cyahr5,1567377886.0,I really like this about the game. I don't spend much in gachas (FEH) but a reminder is always nice.
PokemonMasters,eyld1kz,t3_cxfkuv,1567181662.0,Very underrated game!
GeForceNOW,ewvn7if,t3_cqcyth,1565809836.0,"Dauntless.

A lot of people like Dota Underlords."
GeForceNOW,ewvn2r7,t1_ewvlw2c,1565809754.0,"Probably got banned for cheating, not cloud based gaming. Been playing overwatch for a while and no problems."
dauntless,ev5rlna,t1_ev5qosm,1564237846.0,An inventory/bag would be nice rather than relying on the shops to tell you what you have!
teppen,et00meh,t3_c97wcq,1562370849.0,It's a lot of fun! Fast paced and different! I'm a huge Monster Hunter fan so being able to play with Rathalos and Nergi is dope! And the card art is amazing!!
dauntless,erp57q1,t3_c2yyi8,1561100256.0,Bad ass!
depression,eohx2ok,t3_brsy1y,1558600832.0,OMG! Yes! Today. I got bad news about asking for my salary adjustment at work and it was a punch to the gut. Really feels like whatever I do the universe keeps throwing monkey wrenches at me. My comfort zone is going to sleep and that's what I did. I still feel shitty but I know this is not the end of me. I'm a fighter. I'm a survivor.
