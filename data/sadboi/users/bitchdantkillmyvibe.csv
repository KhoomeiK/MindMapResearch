Also, what are your thoughts on Triple J getting ‘political’? As in, changing the date of the hottest 100, refusing the play certain bands because of transgressions made ie sticky fingers, the smith street band (until recently) etc. Do you think they should be using their platform in this way or just focus on playing good music?"
