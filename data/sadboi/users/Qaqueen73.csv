I know I am bipolar when I am not manic but when I go manic everyone else has issues and I'm mentally fine (But I think I have a really bad physical illness). My case spiralled out of control. 

My husband tried to have me committed 3 times and each time I was let go even when the psychiatrist said I was the worst case of mania she had ever seen. 

Then my time in jail was a complete freaking disaster. Solitary confinement is fucking torture. The lights were on 24 hours a day, there was no natural light (or clocks I could see) so I didn't know what time it was or even how many days had passed, and the noise was maddening. People were yelling and screaming all hours of the day and night but you could VERY CLEARLY hear people talking in the cells around you. I was having hallucinations at the time and thought God was talking to me. They took my glasses because I was a suicide risk so I couldn't see a damn thing except shapes which really f'd with my mind. I had my clothes taken too because I kept flooding my cell by shoving my jumpsuit into the toilet and flushing constantly to drown out the noise.

The good news is all of this probably wouldn't happen again now. Our country has started a mental health diversion program to help keep people out of jail. There are so many places where the system failed me that now I would get help."

My last one was a fucking disaster. I ended up getting arrested for assaulting my (ex)husband,  was placed in solitary confinement, attempted to commit suicide, was declared incompetent to stand trial, spent 45 days in a state mental hospital, plead guilty to assault and was given a 2 year deferred sentence where I had to do what my psych said (I WAS doing that... my meds stopped working). 

I've been stable for almost 10 years and have really changed my life. I've become a big mental health advocate, left my ex, gotten remarried, had another child (with the ex).

My special needs daughter is turning 18 in February. She is intellectually disabled and for YEARS all she has talked about is being able to get a tattoo on her 18th birthday. Her father, step father and I all have tattoos and she even sat with me though a foot tattoo so she knows what is involved. 

I have promised to take her to get mother daughter tattoos on her birthday (2/13) but I would really like to find someone who has experience with special needs clients/family and someone who might be jumpy/anxious (Ok mthat is probably everyone....) . She says she wants her sister's name tattooed on her arm but I would love to talk her out of that. Whatever it is it would be small. 

We are getting guardianship of her when she turns 18 and it looks like even though we wanted her to retain her right to vote they will probably remove that too. This tattoo might be the only ""right of passage"" she will get to experience when she turns 18."

confessions,fbm6fgr,t3_edosq5,1576979223.0,"I do not have Asperger's but my father did and my husband does.  
There are a few things I would suggest. 
First, find your tribe. Actually this is something I hope everyone can do. Find a group of a few people who love and accept you as you are. People who don't give a shit that you're weird or who might be weird too so it's actually normal. Be loyal and supporting of them too.
Second, push your self out of your comfort zone. Learn how to make small talk, force yourself to try and be social. You can learn these skills. It isn't easy but neither a lot if things.
Third, embrace who you are. With every diagnosis there tends to also be good traits that no one focuses on. Like I'm bipolar, I have creativity that I might never have had if I did. Also a little hypomania goes a long way when things need to get done.  My dad saw things in a completely different way than other people and could seriously hyperfocus on things. This helped him become one of the top Scientists in his field.
For the ADHD, I would suggest finding the right medication as well as getting coaching tops on improving your executive functioning. There are so many people out there successfully living with ADHD.  Go look at what works for them.
Finally, don't look at all the people around you and think everything is just  fine with them. FB and other social media are usually only the good stuff in people's lives. Very few people share the bad stuff. It's mostly a lie and if you are in a bad spot it only makes you feel worse. 
I wish you the best of luck."
