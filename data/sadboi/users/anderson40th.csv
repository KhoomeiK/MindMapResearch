I'm very close to the females in my family, particularly my mom (and step mom) and two sisters. Individually and as a family unit, we've all been through very trying times at one time or another (cancer, mental illness, suicide), so for me as a brother and son, I like to look for ways to show other people their value. When I compliment them (on many things, not just looks), I'm telling them they're appreciated - to hear this brings a sort of validation of the one's self.

I haven't in a long time, but I do often feel the desire to compliment others (even males), and I think even for strangers, it's for the same aforesaid reasons. Also, when I see other females I want to compliment, I don't think my interaction with them is entirely absent of my connection with, say, my sisters. That is, I'm sort of reminded of the warm feelings I have toward them. Brother-bear steps in and pastes a resemblance of my sisters on other women."

A good floor person will also be able to replace those floor boards quite seamlessly, especially if you decide to refinish the entire floor.

The process of re-doing wooden floors is overall fairly simple as I've witnessed. You might be able to pay a professional installer to walk you through the process in one room, and then do the other rooms yourself. A walk-behind floor sander will first be used, with a handheld sander being used for all the edges and smaller detailed areas. Then, a wood filler will then be squeegeed across the entire floor, re-sanded lightly, stained, then sealed.

Some people will simply patch spots, but a professional floor installer (on my friends house) made a large batch and squeegeed it across the entire floor. This, he said, is the best way to do it. It turned out quiet well, too!"

My thinking was that it might prove helpful to the medical community if things like this could be manufactured locally, independent of the major mask suppliers, therefore making more resilient communities. 

If specific guidelines for manufacturing (such as sanitation by machine operators) could be implemented, then perhaps a network of small business and hobbyist manufacturers could pick up the slack.

> They found that the nanomachines needed to spin at two to three million times per second to overcome nearby obstacles and outpace natural Brownian motion, the erratic movement of microscopic particles suspended in fluid.

> The molecules could be used either to tunnel into cells carrying therapeutic agents, or to act as killer weapons that blast open tumour membranes.

--------------------------------------------

A bit off topic, but I thought this was cool - I learned about Brownian motion from the YouTuber mentioned below.

Example of Brownian Motion:

https://youtu.be/4m5JnJBq2AU

Brownian motion is the observable motion of microscopic particles (non-living things) due to their collision with water molecules (I think that's correct - again, not a medicine person. Ha!).

This person's channel has talked about it before, though I can't find the video that mentions it. Regardless, it's a super cool channel and got me interested in the molecular world. The YouTuber, a lab tech, plays their own guitar music as an accompanyment to self-made microscopic observations.

I was also thinking a low lying area. Its common to see low lying areas in fields muddy or filled with water from recent rains. When it's dryer the farmers (as I've witnessed) are able to drive through the low areas and just go ahead and plant seeds there. My thinking is that there's no use in trying to determine how high or low some areas will fill with water (getting too wet for plants to grow) and just let the natural settling of water and growing of plants take care of itself.

To increase usable area, maybe they're leveling the land? Pull-behind land graders would be a common piece of equipment for somebody with a tractor to have:

Notice that ""even as"" the Father is in Christ, so are you in Him. God can't be seperated from Himself, so neither can you:

""...that they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me. [22] The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, just as We are one..."" (John 17:21-22)

Hebrews and Romans talks a lot about this union with God that we had (notice past tense) with Christ during His death, burial and resurrection. It's more than vicarious, we were ACTUALLY with Him during His action of saving us. Hebrews 9 sums it  all up with how the outcome should affect us as cleansing ""your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"" (Heb 9:14).

Paul here is writing to the Jews who are doing the same thing we do today - ""maybe I can get closer to God by going to the temple, wearing the right clothing (like a phylactery on my head), taking pride in my family lineage."" Sound familiar? It does to me! ""Gotta have my quiet time. Gotta pray. Gotta go to church to get right/feel close to God. Gotta go door knocking and win souls. Work work work. Do do do.""

God's gift of salvation is free, why would He then make a relationship with Himself conditional? Ask yourself, how good was the saving action of Christ? How pure was His blood? The peace you have with God is dependent on what Christ did, not YOU.

Paul uses harsh words for those who esteem His blood to be impure: ""How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?"" (Heb 10:29) Scary words. No, no, it doesn't mean you're going to hell. At the end of the same chapter we can tell he is comforting the believers who are reading his letter,  ""But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the preserving of the soul."" (Heb 10:39)

We as believers forget this, frequently! Much of what Paul writes is to believers who forget who they really are in Christ.

You have a new heart (Ezekial 36:26), you died WITH Christ and raised WITH Him, too! And! Like it or not, you ARE His child and cannot be removed from Him. Just as Christ is close to the Father, so are YOU. Like it or not, you'll even do good works during your life... apparently you'll just walk into them because,""...we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."" (Eph 2:10)

Your sins have been removed as far as the East is from the West (Psalm 103:12). You're already close. Learn about how He loves you and live from that. I think as His children we're meant for a life of relaxing with Jesus instead of continually treading water to ""stay right"" or ""keep close.""

My ""not-knowing-what-to-do"" has bounced me around many different jobs: construction/handyman stuff, wildland firefighting, farming, ranching, window cleaning, waiter, sub teacher, tutor. By this point, having no goals, I'm wrecked - so bloody exhausted it isn't funny.

I'm now 3 years into my lowest point ever. I practically have nothing, listless. Little employment my dad supplies me by working on his house and being a bum on my buddy's property. Intense bouts of quiet rage and weeping, daily intense suicidal ideation, mood swings, lashing out at myself or others when alone (sometimes in a mirror - it's weird. Always done this. Maybe it comes from acting in theater throughout highschool and college).

I had a doctor suggest Vyvanse but never followed up with it (no insurance right now). All I know is that your body doesn't have to acclimate to it like other medicines and so can be stopped immediately if a person doesn't like it.

My plan right now - I'm not sure to be honest. But I have an idea that might help you:

I've considered taking an off year (or two, or however long). That is, I hate construction work and want out. It doesn't jive with how I function. Anyway, I need work and I need to make money. I finished some online Excel training. If I could get a decent paying job that payed me predictably (unlike what I do now), my only major goals during this time would be **healing** and **working**. I wouldn't worry about goals, plans, whatever. I would simply work, and do whatever nurtures me. So, out with things I waste time with (binge watch YouTube, news, porn, etc - these, deep down, aren't nurturing for me). I would seek counseling and medication (if it helps it helps), keep fit (workout and go hiking), and for fun do more social activities like dancing, or go to museums, theater productions, etc. 

In the short term I'd at least be productive and healthy. The long term? Well, I wouldn't be where I am at now (which sucks), and killing myself is no help either.

The whole ""doing what nurtures you"" idea was really impressed upon me after a close family member took his own life with a shotgun recently. We are so damned good at only looking at our depressed state. There's something more, and based upon what I've learned, people rarely exercise the ability and strength they actually have.

The point of what Jesus is doing is setting a bar SO high as to show the audience their folly of trying to achieve perfection by works. He's trying to make them feel nervous. So, YES, stop trying to be perfect like God! Why? You can't do it!


Can you fulfill the Law? And don't go seperating the 10 commandments from the other 600+. When referring to the Law that the Jews were under, it says ""law"", not ""laws."" So, how are you doing keeping all of them? Mess up lately? I sure have! I had a pork sandwich yesterday! But, to keep things simple, we'll stick to the ten commandments. How're you doing with those? Well, if keeping the law is your standard, look at James: **James 2:10 NASB**

""For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.""


Yikes! I can't do that! Neither could the people Jesus was talking to! That's too high of a standard to meet!


So what are we to do!?! 

Relax! 


**""Don't I have to do works to get/keep saved or keep close to God?""**


No. You died, were buried, and resurrected WITH Christ. Your salvation is as good as Him which took you WITH Him in His saving action. Is Jesus needing resurrection again? No! Neither do you.


Remember WHO you are as HIS child. You have a new heart. You were once in Adam, but now in Christ, and your life IS Christ. Wrap your head around that one. Point being, if Jesus stopped existing, so would you. Because you are made new, and are one with the God of the universe, you actually want what He wants. It's your new nature. Remember - the majority of people in Jesus and Paul's time were illiterate. Many of them were gentiles who new nothing of the Law. The Bible as we know it didn't exist - old testament manuscripts were locked away in a temple somewhere, and the letters of the apostles weren't massively communicated via printing press or satellite. How in the world did these early Christians exist? Answer: God lived in them, just as He does now, operating inside of them. Plus, their new nature as saints (verbage used about believers in New T. letters) guided them naturally. 


Be yourself. God likes you. Chill. It's all been finished. You can't get any closer or further from God. You are already perfectly united with Him.


**""But what about sin!?! And works?""**


Concerning sin, I don't want to sin, do you? I'm sinning fine with all these rules and regulations. Even Paul says, **Romans 5:20**

""The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more...""

Rules make us want to sin and increase the penalty against us.


Concerning works, God will complete in you what He has started. He's even layed up good works for you to do ahead of time:


""For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.""
**Philippians 1:6**


""For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."" **Ephesians 2:10**


When we look to works as a means to salvation, or keeping good with God, it's as if we're saying Jesus wasn't enough. Ask yourself, how good was Jesus work on the cross?


""How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?"" Hebrews 10:29


Hebrews 10:29 sounds scary, and Paul knows this and comforts the Christians reading it, assuring them that as their identity as God's children, they are safe:


""But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the preserving of the soul.""
**Hebrews 10:39**


Paul's letters contain content reminding them about God's truths, about their identity in Christ. Don't misunderstand me and think I'm writing new tablets of stone here. That is, don't get the idea that even under grace we need a perfect understanding about God's love toward us. We don't, nor can we. I forget this all the time. But God is sympathetic toward us and will keep telling us how much He loves us, and will keep romancing us to Himself, until the day we die and meet Him in heaven.


The matter of sin in the Christian's life is little compared to how God wants you to know how much He loves you. Instead of operating from fear, God wants us to have a clean conscience from dead works. Instead, we are to live our lives from a place of love, calm, grace, ""God's got this"" truth and mentality.


A few passages to help:


**Hebrews 10:8-10 NASB**

After saying above, ""Sacrifices AND OFFERINGS AND whole BURNT OFFERINGS AND sacrifices for SIN YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, NOR HAVE YOU TAKEN PLEASURE in them"" (which are offered according to the Law), [9] then He said, ""Behold, I HAVE COME TO DO YOUR WILL."" He takes away the first in order to establish the second. [10] By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.


**Hebrews 10:1-4 NASB**

For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near. [2] Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins? [3] But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year by year. [4] For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.


**Ephesians 2:4-7 NASB**

But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, [5] even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ ( by grace you have been saved), [6] and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, [7] so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus."
TrueChristian,evt7h63,t3_ckyuvt,1564764445.0,"Dude, I'm fascinated by SO many things.

Fantasy (LOTR), science fictions, news, history (medieval, archeology - I love to learn how people lived, did things, how things worked in the past), funny memes, farming and DIY topics. I want to start reading about the French resistance - I'm thrilled by the idea of survival and overcoming obstacles, especially the organization and nitty gritty details surrounding topics like this. Thrilling stuff.

As an aside, beside reading I DO other stuff, too. Love to hike, surf, sing, crack jokes, workout, watch movies.

I used to be anxious about doing things other than ""Jesus stuff,"" like church, Bible reading, witnessing, etc. Because we are new creations and united with Christ, everything we do is spiritual. He romances us in the things we enjoy doing. I can't tell you how much I love watching a rocket launch from California, or simply just NOT thinking about anything and running in the hills, enjoying a burger, or pranking a friend. The humor, creativity; the awe and wonder about particular things that each person has; the places our imaginations take us in, say, a moving scene in our heads -- what is this other than (how do I put this in words?) ourselves being ourselves. As His children we get to just relax and be us, who we are, and enjoy it all."
TrueChristian,evt053v,t3_cky5b0,1564759985.0,"Had the same experience with CoC.

God's economy is based on Jesus' blood, what He did for you, not what you did, or will do, for Him. And no, it isn't based on water either. In simplicity as a child, faith the size of a mustard seed, agreeing with God about your lack of ability to save yourself, you accept His free gift. Count yourself dead and alive WITH Christ. Yes, God had to kill you because you were once IN Adam. Now, you are IN Christ born of God. You are no longer defined by sin, but instead your rebirth and new identity (**Romans 5-6**).

I suggest reading Romans and Hebrews all the way through, this helped me a lot. 

Some resources:

**False Doctrines** by John R. Rice addresses exactly this. Great book.

Andrew Farley talks a lot about what you're going through also:

**Baptism and Salvation**
https://andrewfarley.org/highlights/baptism-and-salvation/

**The Holy Spirit - Living with Jesus Today**
https://andrewfarley.org/audio-sermons/audio-sermon/page/13/

-------------------------------------

- **Romans 4** compares your salvation to Abraham's. If your salvation is the same then, as it is now, where is physical baptism involved?

- The thief on the cross wasn't saved by baptism. I know, I know, ""Yeah, but that was pre-Jesus'-death."" Go back to **Romans 4** and Abraham. 

- From John Rice book, **False Doctrines** (pg. 121), responding to a letter:

""Here the writer probably through ignorance ignores the well-established teaching  of the Bible that people have been saved in all ages exactly the same. In **Acts 10:43** this is expressly stated: ""To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins."" This Scripture says that every prophet in the Old Testament and in the New Testament alike taught the same plan of salvation -- that is, salvation by faith in Christ."" 

- **Hebrews 9:10-14 NASB**
since they relate only to food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until a time of reformation. [11] But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation; [12] and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption. [13] For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh, [14] how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

- To what standard of perfection are you trying to attain? Either in terms of performance, thought, belief, etc? Well, if you're going that route, that
""unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven"" (**Matthew 5:20**). 

**AND**,
 ""whoever says, ‘You fool,’ shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell"" (**Matt. 5:22**). 

**AND**,
""I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. If your right hand makes you stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to go into hell"" (**Matt. 5:27-30**).

depression,evri8t2,t1_evpfxnk,1564709060.0,"Smart phones are great for this. When I hit one of my extremely low moods, I try to immediately send myself an email. I label each email ""Mental Health, date"". This way I can have access to my entries anywhere I go.

I first include details about what I ate, sleep, etc. I then describe how I'm feeling. If I have time the rest is a journal entry - my frustrations, thoughts, etc. Helps understand patterns, what helps, what doesn't, etc. 

I also have a sketch book that is an ""everything journal."" I can write in it, draw, whatever. Sometimes I write a lot. Maybe a drawing here and there. Sometimes I don't touch it for weeks. But it's there when I need it."
acting,erssrq5,t3_c3r569,1561223216.0,"Whatever it takes to know your lines, blocking, etc. Some people learn faster than others. I was once in a speech class and a student memorized, line for line, a speech in one hour (according to him - I believed him. He was a very sharp individual) that would have taken me a couple of days with dispersed, intense periods of memorizing and breaks in between. By breaks I mean doing something else, then coming back to line memorization. Best learning technique for me. I also have to walk and move while I memorize - I talk out loud, I convey all the emotions with body language.

Don't go by what others do necessarily - do what's best for you and your learning style. If it takes longer than others (even hours), do it. 

It's not so much about time spent memorizing as it is about what it will take to be an asset rather than an anchor to the production. Rehearsals for instance: Rehearsals are a golden time of putting chaos into order. You don't want to be a burden to other actors, especially the director, because you don't have your lines, blocking down. Even when scripted rehearsals are allowed (and they will be the first few rehearsals) you still want to come in as an asset to the production. So, you may not know your lines, but you have a really good understanding of your character, their motivations, maybe even some blocking.

During the formative process of piecing a performance together, I'm having a blast. I love being silly and moving around and all the other stuff that comes with performing. The better you have your lines down, the more you can enjoy the process. Have fun!

Okay, so, concrete examples:
- Shakespeare's Midsummer Nights Dream. Lead role as Oberon. 3 months prep (high school play).

Lines are read by cast in a circle maybe twice on two separate days. Notes are being taken, script highlighted. By the third rehearsal we're blocking on the main stage. By the rehearsal after this (now fourth rehearsal) we need to to have some serious lines memorized and I already got told by the director I didn't memorize enough. So...I'm carrying my script with me wherever I go. I spend time in the morning, throughout the day, and a couple times before bed memorizing. Maybe 2 hours a day of active concerted memorizing sessions with small bits of time throughout the day where I'm scanning my script for a few minutes here and there.

- Small one act Christmas play. Humorous. Fast, witty back-and-forth banter. Performed 2018. Most lines of any character except lead role. One week until performance. Only 2-3 rehearsals.

I'm busting my butt to get lines memorized. Morning, day, night I'm practicing as I have the time. Concerted memorization morning and night. Take extra time to meet with lead actor at park to practice blocking and lines. Maybe 2 hours concerted memorization daily (half hour time chunks).

theydidthemath,eq3vmo4,t1_eq3sj4j,1559763913.0,"Another note: hypothermia begins when the body starts to go under 95F. He's in a controlled environment (not in a blizzard), probably shivering like I was - I doubt he would become hypothermic. At least if he did, he would rebound quickly. Also, his behavior (while goofy at times) doesn't appear to show symptoms of hypothermia like lack of self awareness, clumsiness, etc. So... eh...perhaps one could say he dipped down to at or a little above 95F...maybe losing 3 degrees body heat?

One more note: I pulled some muscles in my back this year on the job. I was curious if heat or cold is better for muscles. I can't find the source, but in an article I read, it said that one study leaned towards heat/cold application (to injuries) being more psychological (these were hot or cold pacs being applied to the bodies surface). It then went in to how the body is extremely robust and good at managing its own temperature. Any hot or cold applied to the surface wouldn't be able to penetrate through so much tissue as to make much of a difference. 

Perhaps part way through the challenge, our popsicle eating friend started shivering, therefore raising his body temp and partially countering the effect of the other popsicles he would further ingest.

Okay, this isn't the article, but may be the study the author mentions:

theydidthemath,eq3rnzf,t3_bx3lfk,1559761710.0,"No math here, but related:

I was on a wildfire crew one summer. Sometimes (often) there's a lot of waiting around to receive orders from the chain of command and 20 of us were bored out of our minds on this particular incident. For entertainment we held the ""four-four-forty"" challenge - drink four quarts of water, in four minutes, and hold it down for forty seconds. Whoever did this (or got closest) would win a bag of hot Cheetos.

Several of us participated with me as the winner (3 quarts), and then like a few others, puked my guts out.

The water we used were disposable water bottles kept in ice chests - although, as I recall, for the challenge we used water that wasn't chilled, though not lukewarm (80-90 degrees).

Afterward, all those who took part were huddled  in the transport buggy wearing jackets and shivering. Even after vomiting, it's my guess that the injection of such a high amount of water into our stomachs may have absorbed a lot of body heat. Point being: what a person puts into their body has some effect on body temp. 

According to this site here, involuntary shivering begins ""below a threshold of ~ 95.9˚F (35.5˚C).""
