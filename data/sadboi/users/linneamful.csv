HomeworkHelp,fqcb7px,t3_gi30b7,1589254067.0,"I wish I knew your teacher/professor to know the phrasing they have used. When I took Probability Theory, the phrasing was, ""given,"" so that given the first coin is heads, what is the second coin going to be? 

For both of your questions, I would answer 50% or 1/2. These events are independent, meaning the value of one does not depend on the other. For example, if one comes back heads, that in no way means that the second cannot. So when calculating the probability, you calculate with options. For example, in this you would normally do 0.5 \* 0.5 to get the 0.25 probability for any one of the four possible combinations, however because we know the first, we know with 100% certainty that it is heads. So when calculating I would use 1 instead of 0.5, as 1 is the decimal representation of 100%.

1 (first coin) \* 0.5 (second coin, 50% chance heads, 50% chance tails) = 0.5

&#x200B;

For the second, it's the same logic, it just doesn't matter which coin you know versus which you don't. 

&#x200B;

If that explanation is really muddled, please let me know. I'll be online for the next couple hours and am happy to talk through it."
HomeworkHelp,fqcagep,t3_gi2q23,1589253580.0,"You'll actually end up using the Pythagorean theorem. In this instance, we're forming a right triangle (if you think graphing, the car traveling east makes a horizontal line parallel to the x-axis, and the car traveling west makes a vertical line parallel to the y-axis. Since they leave the same intersection, that is their meeting point, and the two axes together form a right angle). The distance between them would be the hypotenuse, as it is the straight line connecting them as ""true"" distance. 

You'll set this up as a^(2)\+b^(2)=c^(2), where c is the value of the hypotenuse or their distance. From there it becomes a distribution/foil problem.

Growing up, I had three best friends, all of whom I'm still in touch with today (I met them at ages 6, 8, and 10). The one I am closest to is more of a sister than friend - she comes to family holidays, is in the family group chat, and talks to my cousin completely independently of me. Shes my best friend. When I was 19, we got tattoos together - matching ones on our feet with a dandelion that say, ""Our roots will always be tangled. I'm glad for that."" At the time, we were in completely different places in life, and the above is a segment of a quote that means the world to me - ""Growing apart does not change the fact that we once grew side by side. Our roots will always be tangled. I'm glad for that.""

My second tattoo is a Harry Potter tattoo - a silhouette of the Marauders in front of the full moon with the words, ""until the very end,"" above it in my oldest friend's handwriting.

I dont have one with the third friend yet, but I've been planning it.

My third tattoo is a semicolon,  a mental health awareness tattoo. It's small and on my ankle, and it was on a whim. A shop in my college town did $25 semicolon tattoos during Suicide Prevention Week and all proceeds went to a national charity for suicide prevention. I went with friends for them to get one and opted to get one myself. I love it.

I have more planned. I want my wedding band tattooed on. I want one in each of my parents' handwriting saying, ""I love you."" 

I want one for my kids when I have them.

I love them. But I also want them where I can choose if they can be seen. And so far, that's working for me. :)

It may not have come across this way, but what my point was meant to be that there are productive mediums for discussion that can lead to neither of the above. A firm statement that the behavior is uncalled for, that they are offending you, that as a person, you should not be treated that way.

Also, in what way did he call out racism? He didnt address the issue at all; OP got angry (rightfully), but he made no point to address what the tourists were saying.

Yelling offensive things doesn't solve anything. It may feel good for a moment, but it doesn't change their opinion. It doesn't improve the issue. Shouting profanity at someone as they walk away from you isn't standing up against racism or helping create a constructive medium for discussion in any way. ""Go back to your own country, you cunts,"" doesn't exactly say, ""Man, I'm offended at the way you're addressing me as your fellow human. Please do not talk to or about me that way."" It's just calling them a rude name.

I am not saying not to say SOMETHING, but the choice of how OP handled the situation makes it an asshole move. There are good ways to have that discussion that DO involve confronting the racism, I just dont believe OP chose one of those.

Never give them the opportunity to feel justified in their hatred.

NOTE: I'm not saying they ARE justified, just that people who treat others so poorly often want to play the victim so that when they retell it later and to feel that they're in the right for their shitty behavior."

changemyview,fcxeal5,t1_fcvrvsi,1578060639.0,"I would argue that the disclaimer doesn't fit this reply. He's saying that we could completely take computation out of math if we wanted to, it would just make things more abstract and difficult to comprehend. The purpose of that comment is that math isn't just computation. The computation is an aide to help make it concrete and applicable to the real world, but math exists outside of it. Which is why it is a problem-solving process rather than a strictly computational method."
changemyview,fcxds3j,t3_ej5dyr,1578060235.0,"Math degree and former seventh grade math teacher here. My first argument is more against your definition of math being computation. Math is, in so many ways, a language and a process. It has it's own syntax and ""grammar"" and it is far, far more than just coming up with the right number. Along with computation,  the true goal of math classes, imo, is to help address problem-solving thought processes and learning a systematic approach.

Second, from the education side of things. I worked in a low-income school. Most of my kids did not have any form of computer at home or internet, and we were not a school with 1:1 laptop accessibility. But many of my students did have cell phones, which have the basic calculator in them, which for seventh grade math was more than enough if taught how to enter things correctly.

Additionally, there's the focus aspect of it all. I am going back to school currently (nursing), and I just wrapped up psychology. There was a segment of the book around focus, and one of the topics discussed was around laptops in classes, including some who believe that even having them present in a classroom can hinder focus, even if they are closed on a desk. 

My classroom had a COW of computers I used in each of my classes, and let me tell you. Kids turned off the wifi to get the dinosaur game in Chrome, muted speakers and got on coolmathgames.com (which contrary to the title has very few cool math games), pressed the power button on their neighbor's laptop just to get a rise out of them... Laptop days were not great in my classroom. With a calculator, the worst they could do was type notes using the alpha button.

Next - durability. You say it is more cost effective, but TI calculators can last decades at around $130 each. Laptops are more expensive and would require more frequent upgrades. They also require more maintenance from IT and are more likely to malfunction.

And finally - I love Excel so much, and it is great for many things. But anyone wanting to go into math as a career will likely need proper coding experience. One of my best friends is a data scientist, and her days are spent with R and Python due to the sheer volume of the data she is analyzing. Excel literally couldn't hold it all. For things outside of math careers, I would argue that we use the equivalent of our phone calculators for 80% of computation. And a TI calculator is much more similar to that functionality than Excel, meaning it actually applies to more real world situations."

FanFiction,fcn7f9a,t1_fcmnr4s,1577805225.0,"Also not OP, but I tend to write a bulleted list of things that need to happen, beginning to end - essentially, every step needed to get where I'm going. Then I divide the list into chunks that I estimate as chapters (that part is kind of fluid, depending on what happens when writing). Then I work off of it like a checklist, crossing off each point as it occurs so I make sure everything that is needed to build to my resolution makes it in. Example from current WIP:

Things that need to happen:
...
-Kei and Tadashi have a chat about feelings
-Kei and Hinata become friends
-Kei goes to Hinata’s house
-Kei and Natsu have a bonding moment
-Kei and Hinata’s mom have a bonding moment
...

It's fairly vague so I have room to reimagine if an idea doesn't shape up the way I wanted, but it gives me a guide to work from.

AmItheAsshole,f8gzhke,t3_e0muyw,1574567366.0,"NTA. I have OCD, and I've gone off my meds before. (This is also something I haven't thought about with regards to getting pregnant in the future.) OCD has other names like, ""the doubting disease,"" and some of it's biggest symptoms are obsession (obviously), extreme guilt, and constant fear of causing harm/problems and completing compulsions or rituals  to combat them.

You have one hell of a wife, and I'm in awe of her. As others have said, a fed baby is a happy baby, and the benefits of breastfeeding in this instance are, imo, nullified by the detriment to your wife's health (because mental health IS health).

She doesn't need more people antagonizing, second-guessing or blaming her right now, and 8f they can't understand that, it's good to keep them away for a bit.

I do agree with the comments of framing it in a better way, but outside of that, I would give a clear explanation. A lot of people don't really understand the nature of OCD, so they likely don't comprehend HOW damaging they're being. If your wife is open about her diagnosis and okay with it, it might be a good teaching moment. If not, then they still should have listened and been respectful of your needs, and they can reap what they sow while she gets back to herself.

Enjoy that little boy of yours, though. :)"

unpopularopinion,f83jtw8,t3_dyoubm,1574213638.0,"I may be too late to the party, but just to weigh in - I disagree that a professor that doesn't curve with poor scores is a bad professor. IMO curving is a detriment to education; while it inflates grades and allows more to pass, it also means that you are evaluated based on who you are in the class with. Students in two different sections of a course could get the same number of correct answers (let's say 35/50, a solid 70%) but one could get the C they earned while the other gets an A because the highest score was a 37/50 in his class.

The competency of your peers has no bearing on your own understanding of the content, and it should in no way add to or detract from your grade.

As a student, I would be livid if I got a C for the same work a student in the same class but a different section got an A for because my timeslot fit best for the students in the honors section of the department.

As a teacher (former 7th grade math teacher), your job as a student is to learn the material.  If the entire class does poorly, that doesn't tell me to curve. That tells me to reteach the content in a new way to help the class as a whole understand and to allow them to redo the material with a better mastery of the content. 

I agree with you that failure to support learning and education makes for a bad teacher/professor. Just the curving causes disagreement here."

OCD,f6y35un,t1_f6weqr5,1573266261.0,"Hey! :)

I can only really speak to my experience. For me, my OCD seemed to happen like flipping a switch. It wasn't there and then suddenly it was. (Were there cues before that were less distressing? Maybe. It's been almost a decade, and I couldn't tell you.)

I was a mess; one of my biggest compulsions is confessing (this may be a bit universal, I'm not really sure). Even then, when I think something terrible or awful, even if I know I don't mean it, I am driven to tell someone about it (in those days - my mom). So out of the blue, I start having these really intense, unexplained harm OCD thoughts. I was horrified, I told my mom about them, she provided reassurance that everyone has occasional dark passing thoughts and that I should try to let it go (again, we had no idea at the time what the best way to handle obsessions/compulsions were). 

I was ashamed, I was terrified to talk about it, I knew inside me that I didn't mean/want those things, but I was afraid that I did, and that's why the thoughts were occurring. My mom offered to take me to a therapist, but I was so, so afraid that they would tell me I was an awful person, that I did mean what I was thinking, that I was a danger to myself and others and needed to be locked up. So instead, I quit my job (part-time in high school), stopped spending time with friends, left my church (and later the religion, but that wasn't an OCD choice), and overall became very depressed and isolated myself, to the point that I remember telling my mom, ""If I thought I had to live like this for the rest of my life, I wouldn't want to be alive anymore."" (Not I *don't*, because I believed it would get better, but I didn't know how.)

And so I saw my first therapist. One session. I couldn't tell her everything; it was too hard. She gave me gum, a rock to keep in my pocket, and something else (I don't remember what), and essentially told me that when the thoughts were there, I should try chewing gum or feeling the rock; I should try to describe the sensations of the gum or memories associated with going to the creek as a kid, and pull myself away from my thoughts.

I didn't go back. Instead, we tried our county behavioral health services. I was so distressed that I left the room bawling and went to the bathroom, and my mom had to tell him everything that had been happening. He put me on an anti-psychotic that made me feel absolutely insane, and some light sleeping pills for the nights that I couldn't sleep because I was so anxious.

I only took the meds once; it felt like my thoughts were talking to each other and made me feel crazy. I hated it. (My brother had been on them once before, and he had the same reaction.) I couldn't do it, and I couldn't talk about it. So I developed coping mechanisms; I couldn't be in the quiet, I didn't like to be alone (or I wanted ONLY to be alone), I didn't want to be in the house with only one other person in case my thoughts were real; I wouldn't drive without being on the phone because I was afraid to be alone with my own mind.

No one told me that OCD could present with harm thoughts and compulsions or that some of the other intrusive thoughts that were absolutely wrecking my life were *normal* for this disorder. No one told me that internalized compulsion (Pure O) was a thing. I was too ashamed/afraid to talk about it, and my mom always reassured me that what I was experiencing wasn't who I was as a person (which was so, so good emotionally, but not great from the reassurance OCD side of things). 

I stumbled across OCD by accident in searching around, and I found myself going, ""OH! This is it! This is me"" I read other peoples' stories and realized that they thought the same things I did, that they did similar things to deal with it, that it wasn't just me. That I wasn't the only one. That other people dealt with all of this and that it didn't make me a sick, twisted, awful person. 

I only knew OCD as the, ""Use each bar of soap once,"" ""Everything must be perfectly lined up,"" ""Lock the door seventeen times,"" illness. If someone had been talking about the types of thoughts, the internalized compulsions, the absolute misery that was this disorder, I may have understood better. I may have been able to talk about it. To know that a therapist had probably heard it before.

The jokes don't bother me at all. But I want to see the real thing out there, too, so that maybe younger me's who are struggling can figure it out sooner and get the help they need."
