orchids,f4oiz1p,t3_dl99uw,1571702381.0,"I'm attempting to learn more about orchid care and I want to learn and get better at.   


A few weeks ago, I learned that I tend to overwater my orchids and I rotted out the roots of several plants. I trimmed all of the rotten  roots. I put newer, drier soil and made sure that the plants received proper drainage.   


Lately, the surviving orchids seem to be surviving. However, I'm wondering about this guy thats pictured. I thought that this plant was completely dead, but it seems like these roots aren't brittle and breaking off. Every other day, I soak it in a jar of brita water for 20-30 min and then return it to its pot.   


Does this guy have a chance at survival?"

As an adult, I gained more confidence in myself. I have a lot of scars from the past, but want to look for a group where I fit in. 

I associate the “popular clique” with bullies"
LifeAfterNarcissism,f08z5rh,t1_f08y4by,1568490751.0,"Right! During Thursday’s group session, the therapist asked “what would it be like to go a trip with the other group members” One of the group members said that he wouldn’t go on a trip with me, because he doesn’t like me. In response, I told him that “If I went on a trip with you, I would be afraid of saying something stupid. You would be authoritative” 

Now I’m imagining if I spent 12 hours in a car with this friend, would I enjoy it? Maybe bits and pieces, but I wouldn’t like his bragging. Food and comic movies, sure. College football? No. I’m more into art and documentaries. 

Lately, I’m thinking about doing more things alone and seeing what happens. I don’t need to invite him if I don’t feel like it."

sexover30,etubhu2,t1_etu9i7t,1563208812.0,"I have a best friend who is getting a PhD in social work. I told her my upbringing and family background. From what I've told her, she concluded that I've come from a narcissistic family. What I thought was a normal childhood wasn't. My brother was the golden child who was the ""favorite"" and got more attention, while I was the ""forgotten child"" who was free, but didn't get as much attention. My friend also confirmed that I'm on the autistic spectrum. 

&#x200B;

When I first entered therapy, I was someone who didn't know how to identify feelings and express them. I was someone who was ""anecdotal"" and told a lot of stories. This didn't emotionally connect with others. I've been attending group therapy for more than two years and I'm able to identify and express emotions a lot easier. I have more eye contact and confidence when I talk to people. However, I've been told that I come across as intelligent, but nervous. Theres still a lot of work that needs to get done, but I'm making progress.   


One goal is that I hope to be able to better connect with people. Maybe even get into a serious relationship and fall in love? I lived with roommates before, but I never lived with a lover. That sounds like something nice :)"
sexover30,etr62tu,t1_etqxnmp,1563113307.0,"I'm not sure if it would work for me. 

It seems like an arranged marriage would work if the parents/relatives were closely involved in their sons/daughters life. The parents would know their son's/daughters personality and interests and would arrange accordingly. 

My parent's aren't really involved in my life and don't really listen to what I have to say. They tried introducing me to some girls, but it wasn't good. I would respect arranged marriage if there was a level of understanding between all the parties. I've seen plenty of examples where its been successful.
