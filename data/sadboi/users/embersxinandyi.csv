YouShouldKnow,fqynsf0,t1_fqylfdb,1589751601.0,"happiness within unhappiness, now this just symantics. i suppose its like a buff. permanent +3 happiness points. so you could be at -6, and a relationship would bring you up to -3. Or you could look at it like bonus resistance. you are at -6 happiness but a relationship gives 30% unhappiness resistance. you were at 4 happiness, lost your job (-10) but have 30% resistance because of SO, that puts you at -3. 

Beyond this, I think many would put their SO seperate from happiness and unhappiness. They would rather be unhappy with their SO then alone, not because of the resistance, but simply because of... Them. 

Them is an item you cannot buy. You find it, and it finds you. Grants no ablities or buffs like Relationship, but it is priceless. No one is sure what it does, but legend has it once you have it you would do anything to keep it."

Your girlfriend is being dumbass. She deserves to suffer for it, you see? It is the only logical thing to do. Only then will she break up you. Yes. You, who needs the internet to make the decision of whether or not you should you put your companion at ease. She had what was coming to her.
