AskReddit,fqvq52c,t3_gl4p0k,1589682679.0,My first memory I believe was when I was 2 or three. It's very vague. I remember being in my parents first apartment which had a beige color to it. There were taco bell wrappers around and a SNES.
relationship_advice,fqcj47t,t1_fqchqi0,1589259550.0,"Don't entertain that deluded person. It's perfectly valid to not be attracted to every trans woman alive. Some transwomen don't pass well, there is usually a big difference between a neovagina and a real one, and they have male pheromones. Also some men want to have children. I know it is a sad thing but as close as transwomen can come they are not biological females. They need to learn to be comfortable with that reality and accept their own identity instead of spewing nonsense. FFS, love yourself. Not everyone is going to be attracted to you just like not everyone is attracted to me. Sexuality is fluid."
AskMen,fpiibj3,t3_gdhhx0,1588641498.0,Found this on r/all. As a woman I wouldnt want men posting in the askwomen sub. Why aren't men allowed to be upset about women posting here? What is even the point of this sub then? Your attempt at being progressive is ruining your own subreddit. Don't be surprised when some sub pops up like r/actuallyaskmen and this place ends up deserted.

greentext,fmnopgn,t1_fmnf91y,1586231159.0,"I'm looking for a job and one place I applied to had me do a video screen. I dolled myself up and rehearsed as much as I could. Then when it came time to do the real thing my cat walked through during the first question and I froze up completely. I attempted to do the next question but froze up again, slammed my phone down and went into my bedroom to sob for 20 minutes. So yeah fuck video screens. Not good for anyone who isnt very confident and articulate."

I cant remember all the details but I know the CO's beat her and she had amnesia. Around that time I think it was discovered they were stealing drugs from the evidence room. Very corrupt all around. I appreciate your concern."

SuicideWatch,fcpxzsx,t3_eieayu,1577874584.0,"As soon as the ball dropped panic set in. Sad at time gone by, scared for the future, and overall restlessness wondering if anything can make me satisfied. I feel like Im sabotaging my personal relationships and I cant stop. Sometimes the only thing stopping me is the love of all these people - the problem is I dont feel deserving and know it's only a matter of time before people see me for the flake, burden, desperate, empty shell I am. I can see it happening. I just dont feel fit to be a human and among the ones I love. I cant do this, I often just want to pack up my car and drive until I run out of gas, wander a bit, and die."
