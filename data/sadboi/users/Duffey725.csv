nfrealmusic,fit9e8n,t3_f9ppc0,1582710636.0,i dont think this happens for many people. i think that some people just dont like or connect with his music. not they dont want to confront their feelings
nfrealmusic,fi2a0rr,t3_f5x88i,1582074946.0,Personally alot of it for me is having overplayed his earlier songs that they now seem boring. But also yeah hes grown so much as an artist that i think his newer stuff is way better

nfrealmusic,eypw314,t3_cxxtej,1567313459.0,"Actually 'No Excuses' is the Eminem diss on the album. Here's why. 

1. ""If i told you i respect you, i ain't say it loosely"" - NF previously said he respected em and then em had a slight diss at eminem which he don't like :(
2. ""I just did a interview the guy was pretty clueless"" - Eminem has done interviews in the past. Hes calling eminem clueless. 
3. ""Yeah, i got no"" - The first letter of no is 'n'. There is also an 'n' in the name EmiNem. Hes saying that he has Eminem in his sights and that he is literally going to beat him to death - hence why he says 'Yeah'. Then the 'i' is referencing Cleaning Out My Closet, where Eminem says ""I'm cleaning out my closet"". NF is saying that Eminem is gay and in the closet but won't admit it which is why he called Tyler the Creator a f\*\*\*ot. 

Love it or hate it these are clear disses. and im expecting a whole album next week where NF challenges Eminem to a rap battle and also calls his daughter ugly and hopes that she dies"
