Garmin,fr18q7u,t3_ghn2ko,1589815361.0,"What devise would you guys recommend for somebody coming from a Fitbit Inspire HR.  I’m not looking to spend a lot,  so I have it narrowed down to a Vivoactive 3 or Forerunner 45S.  I’m looking for daily tracking, hr monitoring, sleep tracking and I don’t want anything that’ll take up a lot of space on my arm which is why I’m looking at the 45s.

Pros and cons of each?"

Garmin,fppagw7,t1_fpp0fmi,1588798760.0,That’s good to hear.  I have the Inspire HR now and the charge is very close to features and size.  Do you find the Vivoactive to feel chunky on your wrist after being use to the smaller Fitbit?
Garmin,fpogech,t3_geh641,1588784051.0,"I’m thinking of switching from Fitbit to Garmin;  but having a hard time trying to decide which one is best.  It’ll either be the Vivoactive 3 (or 4 if on sale), the Forerunner 45s (skinny wrists) or maybe even the 245.  
I like the HR monitor, steps, and sleep app mainly. 

Any suggestions from current owners would be great."
