weed,fqgzl1g,t1_fqgyyea,1589362669.0,will i b ok tho
Psychedelics,fqaxz4f,t1_fq830v9,1589227211.0,ive decided to do it. my friend has a house that is good to trip in. i feel safe tripping there and doing it with her because i‚Äôll have someone with me. i‚Äôm gonna bring my trip killers n drop 500 mics but after that i‚Äôm definitely gonna wait a while before tripping again because ive been doing it way too often lately. she‚Äôll be dropping too but a lower dose than me and it‚Äôs better than being alone
Psychedelics,fq73cd6,t1_fq5o0wv,1589141255.0,i might drop at my friends house because she‚Äôs tripsat me before i mean she didn‚Äôt stay completely sober she smoked n shit but she was able to be there for me in case anything went wrong which it hasn‚Äôt so far lol.
Psychedelics,fq733wi,t1_fq5oj0s,1589141166.0,"thank you. i can totally see that bad trips have the potential to not necessarily be a bad thing just unpleasant and uncomfortable in the moment. it sounds like if you go into it with an open mind, even if the experiences are uncomfortable it‚Äôs a part of tripping sometimes and i have to embrace that too and could maybe learn from it. on higher doses do you still have self control? because at 250 ive lost touch with reality n shit and what‚Äôs going on around me but i‚Äôve still kept my inhibitions and didn‚Äôt go completely crazy or do anything stupid. will it be similar on 500?"
Psychedelics,fq72blv,t1_fq65w9f,1589140875.0,"it kinda sounds like what y‚Äôall are saying is that higher doses are more intense but most of the hesitation is just fear? because i feel like i have been half in will all my trips lately. it makes me sad how tripping is my favorite thing in the world but i‚Äôm too scared to go all in. i haven‚Äôt done 250 mics in a long time so i think im going to do that next time and then increase it to like 400. i‚Äôll be okay, i have trip killers and shit and part of that is comforting because even though i like to ride it out and have barely had to take them it‚Äôs a very reassuring thing to know that if my trip goes in a damaging or intensely terrifying direction then i have those."
Currentlytripping,fq71bk6,t1_fq5ruge,1589140504.0,hell yeah i was! and that was cool to look at haha
Drugs,fq712ib,t1_fq5smfy,1589140413.0,so true. i usually only take acid in my room alone at night or with friends in their house at night. ive never really gone out in nature tripping or anything and i will change that one day. and that‚Äôs totally understandable. i don‚Äôt understand ppl that just take acid like it‚Äôs fucking advil or something. for me i always gotta plan it out and really think about it and honestly i can never be sure if i‚Äôm ready to drop until the day i do it because if i‚Äôm feeling sad or something i know i can‚Äôt because my mind tends to go to a pretty bad place on acid easier than it does when i take shrooms even though i‚Äôve heard the opposite is more common lol.
Psychedelics,fq5mkpl,t1_fq5lefk,1589110988.0,if those two things are the only difference then why do you hear more about people experiencing things like ego death at higher doses than at lower ones? i‚Äôm not scared of the visuals anymore i‚Äôve gotten used to them and i love them. i‚Äôve found ways to manage the come up. my main fear is that i‚Äôll start being incredibly mindfucked and won‚Äôt be prepared to handle it because i‚Äôll be more prone to having bad thoughts at higher doses so i wanna minimize the risk of having bad thoughts. like obviously there‚Äôs no way to ensure that i won‚Äôt because it‚Äôs acid but i don‚Äôt want to have a trip that could damage me mentally or leave me traumatized
Drugs,fq5it7y,t3_ggumkz,1589107052.0,im tripping right now lol yes girl i‚Äôm glad that u tried it and had a good experience it sounds like you did it responsibly in a good place with someone you trust so i am in full support of it! it always makes me really happy to see people using it responsibly because people doing it is what is going to get this shit legalized so that these stupid research chemicals can stop going around and killing people. it‚Äôs beautiful because it‚Äôs more than just a drug it‚Äôs an experience. it‚Äôs not for everyone but for those of us that it is we should be able to trip safe and trip happy without the societal stigma up our asses
Currentlytripping,fq5cwoi,t3_gctoxc,1589100587.0,im tripping right now and i was trying to figure out what that is and now i see it‚Äôs a roof i think
Drugs,fq55nos,t3_ggefxd,1589093313.0,bruh this makes me wanna try 2C-B. i tried MDMA once and i was feeling horny and refused to masturbate because i was worried that if i did my orgasms would never be as good ever again
selfharm,fq5407g,t1_fpzypo8,1589091802.0,i love you too!
selfharm,fq53zxq,t1_fpzypc9,1589091795.0,"thank you! it‚Äôs been a day since i‚Äôve done it and i feel guilty for doing it since i feel like i could have done more. my parents are so open to supporting me but i feel like i can‚Äôt go to them because i don‚Äôt want to and i don‚Äôt even know why. they‚Äôre so good and the guilt is eating me up inside because i feel like i just fucked them over. i try hard everyday to take good care of myself and i don‚Äôt want to have to go back to residential. i‚Äôm just glad that this time before i did it, i sat down and meditated because at least i tried something. i need to figure out what i will do next time though in addition to that because meditating was not enough."
ActualHippies,fq52lcy,t3_gfvlt1,1589090564.0,"to be honest i don‚Äôt know. this is beautiful and i hope so more than anything but from what i have seen i feel like people are just gonna rush to go back to normal. i hear it everyday all over the news here are the stats here‚Äôs how close we are to getting back to normal everyone is antsy and sad that they‚Äôre stuck at home and once this ends people aren‚Äôt gonna care about anything except going to the mall or seeing their friends again or going back to work or being able to reschedule their vacation which isn‚Äôt BAD to do those things and feel that way at all except for the fact that the last thing on anyone‚Äôs mind will be how we will move forward or how we will help those out that were heavily affected by this. of course there‚Äôs going to be more people than before that want to help and are going to become more conscious of the struggles of those around them. the sadness they experienced from not being able to see the ones they loved will make people value their loved ones more. but for the majority, people will mindlessly go back to what they were doing before. it will be slightly better but not enough to change the world to the point where it needs to be changed. 


that‚Äôs just how i perceive it and what i think will happen based off of the information i‚Äôve been given. i could be dead wrong. but that is what i think will happen. everyone can do better no matter who they are ‚ù§Ô∏è"
SelfHarmScars,fpz5z3b,t3_gfh9b9,1589014017.0,haha i‚Äôm gonna pick some up tomorrow too for a similar reason. LSD can help tremendously with stuff like this if you are using it for the right reasons <3

selfharm,fpz4smp,t3_gg9lwq,1589013594.0,"you can tell me to fuck off but i‚Äôm speaking from experience here. if you are someone with an addictive personality, it can be dangerous and bad for your mind. if you get addicted to it, then every time you feel sad or hurt your mind will automatically tell you to hurt yourself. it‚Äôs a pain in the ass. it sounds like you‚Äôre going through some deep shit that you don‚Äôt deserve to be dealing with and i can see why you would want to cut. you‚Äôll be happier if you don‚Äôt do it again"

selfharm,fpz2t3z,t3_gg2xym,1589012770.0,i feel that so hard. i have old ones and new ones and even when i was like a year clean i would just stare at them and touch them and shit. no idea why it‚Äôs just somewhat satisfying to see what i did to myself for some reason. i don‚Äôt even want attention from it anymore but at the same time i kind of do because part of the reason why i used to do it was for attention. not anymore though.
troubledteens,fpmksdh,t1_fpkuzi9,1588735272.0,my homies wouldn‚Äôt do that lmao

Sober,fpfsa6o,t1_fpcj7vo,1588581669.0,jesus i can‚Äôt believe i only posted that four days ago it feels like an eternity. that makes a lot of sense. i‚Äôd assume that can happen with almost anything you regularly put into your body. i‚Äôm still extremely irritable but less so than a few days ago. the thoughts are less irrational than before but for some reason a lot of this resentment is going towards my parents and it makes me feel terrible. i‚Äôm not taking it out on them because i love them and they don‚Äôt deserve it but my fuse is so short so i have to take a step back to get my shit together and not hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings.
Synesthesia,fpbt4n4,t1_fp8zm0z,1588478052.0,is it like so bad you can‚Äôt even stand it sometimes?
Sober,fpbt2a4,t1_fpboydq,1588478007.0,thanks sm. it‚Äôs been a couple days and the nic cravings r still there. i‚Äôm feeling more like myself tho. still don‚Äôt know what my plan is. and don‚Äôt worry i fucking hate alcohol lol
troubledteens,fp90sz5,t3_g7h20r,1588409951.0,I also went to Sunrise. You summed this up perfectly. I just genuinely hope you're well and okay. If you ever need to talk you can message me.

troubledteens,fp4x4v7,t1_fp3qr1p,1588309727.0,thank you! not quite. my grandparents are from ravenna and immigrated to venezuela and then my parents immigrated to the US :-)
uvic,fp31k73,t1_fp3136f,1588271515.0,oh ok cool because i‚Äôll actually be doing running start next year. i‚Äôm willing to go through some extra work if that‚Äôs what it takes as long as it‚Äôs worth it!
troubledteens,fp2zesj,t1_fp0z45k,1588270463.0,yes! i‚Äôve spent hours researching the effects of psychedelics and i love psychedelics more than almost anything. i cannot wait to get off my medication. i‚Äôm excited to take a stand when i turn 18 i already have a lot of plans on what i‚Äôm gonna do. i turn 18 in february and summer 2021 is gonna be my summer. summer 2020 seems like it‚Äôs kind of gone down the shithole already. i‚Äôve looked and the place i‚Äôm most likely going to is called THIRA. it‚Äôs in bellevue washington and to me it seems okay regarding abuse and all that. the average time there is 4-8 weeks which to me is absolutely nothing. thank you so much! i got this. right now it doesn‚Äôt feel like i do though. i‚Äôm ready to take back control because that‚Äôs something sunrise never let me have and that feeling of not being in control is gonna be there for a long time :/
troubledteens,fp0x3a3,t1_fp0wkvk,1588218887.0,i honestly don‚Äôt even know at this point. they‚Äôre not extremely conservative but they did grow up in another country and never did dumb shit as teenagers. my dad has really bad anxiety like me but he never acted out. he was valedictorian and shit. my mom just kinda spent her teen years doing her school and hanging with friends n all that. i am definitely not going to run away i can‚Äôt do that. i‚Äôm just tired as to how whenever something is mildly wrong they put my therapist up on a pedestal and only listen to what my therapists and psychiatrists say. then they repeat the same shit to me over and over again. i‚Äôm going off my medication. they don‚Äôt want me to do drugs then fine i won‚Äôt anymore. shrooms have done way more for me than my antidepressants ever did. i just want to feel like i‚Äôm in control again.
troubledteens,fp0u2ve,t1_fp0juzc,1588216935.0,lol my parents snagged my cash and all my stuff so i can‚Äôt get shit. i‚Äôm crying a lot because of all the stuff going on at home and they keep trying to help but i don‚Äôt  know what to tell them because i have no idea how they can help me and it makes me feel super bad because i don‚Äôt even WANT their help and i have no idea why. thank you for the encouraging words though. it feels really good to hear ‚ù§Ô∏è
troubledteens,fp0tve1,t1_fp0gbwr,1588216802.0,yeah haha. places like that are fucking disgusting and i want to do something to stop it i just don‚Äôt know what yet. i stg these bitches see dollar signs in our fucking eyes.
troubledteens,fp0tsk4,t1_fp0j3fk,1588216753.0,YES
troubledteens,fp0tqw1,t1_fp0iy1m,1588216724.0,no it‚Äôs totally fine! two and a half years wow i can‚Äôt even imagine. it‚Äôs fucking badass that you got through that. i‚Äôm trying to re establish control over my life now because i want to say fuck you to everyone who was talking down to me when i was there. and yeah i‚Äôm so glad my place wasn‚Äôt religious either. since it was in utah most of the staff was mormon tho and they would kind of try to shove it down ur throat and it was fucking annoying. they did subtle things like try to get me to stop wearing black or listening to rock music. also i left a review on the page too it‚Äôs by Adriana Tamburini lol.
Sober,fp0tenj,t1_fp0guxv,1588216509.0,"oh my god i fucking love you. this is just the validation i needed right now. i‚Äôm so embarrassed that i‚Äôm dealing with this right now because all my friends are still smoking everyday and i don‚Äôt wanna talk to them about it because i‚Äôm scared they‚Äôll judge me. i‚Äôm so fucking angry all the time and i keep channeling that anger by thinking about trauma from my past. i feel like i have no control over my life due to it. i have been exercising twice a day, meditating, doing my homework etc. it‚Äôs only been six days and i hate this so bad. it just feels good to know that there is someone that is withdrawing off of the same shit i am and that‚Äôs there‚Äôs an actual reason as to why i‚Äôm feeling this way"
troubledteens,fp0c0rm,t1_fovkhv8,1588206366.0,"i won‚Äôt go back to a TTI just a PHP my mistake for not making that clear enough in the actual post. my hatred for TTI‚Äôs has grown as more time passes since getting home because i am reversing all the brainwashing from there. my parents still put that place on a pedestal because they DID their job of keeping me alive and for that i am grateful for but damn the way they monetize that shit is terrible. if you have the time, look at the google reviews for Sunrise RTC real quick. the claims the girls have been making in those reviews are very true and the lady from sunrise responding to the reviews (her name is sue) is being extremely bitchy and condescending towards them. it is a perfect example as to how these treatment centers will silence us and trauma that we had to go through there. the staff cares about us for the most part most of them just seem like naive college students. the second these bitches get promoted though all of that goes out the fucking window."
troubledteens,fp0bfr1,t1_fovjxr1,1588206048.0,i guess i do. i was only 13 when i got sent there and didn‚Äôt really associate with the older girls so i guess i was mistaken on that. i‚Äôm sorry. honestly what u described does not sound out of character for a TTI
troubledteens,fp0ba0m,t1_fow1sq3,1588205964.0,thanks! i think i am going through withdrawals from either weed or nic (probably nic) because i feel VERY bitchy right now and i know it‚Äôs not my period. like i feel super angry. that and weird ass dreams combined with sleep problems

troubledteens,fove264,t1_fomjds9,1588099760.0,i can‚Äôt go back and even if i do i turn 18 in nine months and i will sign myself out on midnight on my 18th birthday.
troubledteens,fovdx5z,t1_fomsq7k,1588099694.0,thank u for sharing your story. i hope that you overcame that because you don‚Äôt deserve that treatment. i do need to find the real underlying issue but it‚Äôs so difficult sometimes. i‚Äôm gonna do it though.
troubledteens,fovdk2h,t1_fosqjvr,1588099522.0,ugh honestly idk. i was doing a bunch of other drugs too but not consistently and not any hard drugs. i mean i was smoking weed all the fucking time but bruh idek anymore. i think it‚Äôs a mix of both at this point.
troubledteens,fovdege,t1_fooptru,1588099447.0,oh no no i‚Äôm going to an actual rehab. no TTI for me if i was getting sent to one of those i wouldn‚Äôt be typing this message rn id be on the streets cuz i fucking ran away. they‚Äôre probably still gonna treat me like a child there but i‚Äôm finna keep my dignity n be honest w my therapists n shit and be an adult about this cuz i will be one in less than a year.
troubledteens,foogylp,t1_fomuljp,1587938776.0,nah no opiates or booze i actually DID have a deal set up to buy some opiates though before i got caught. so i guess it‚Äôs good that i wasn‚Äôt able to buy them cuz all my life ive been against the use of opiates and (for myself) alcohol. if i did though i would have definitely looked into that.
troubledteens,foogsfe,t1_fom1c9n,1587938687.0,"thank you so much. i cannot go to a family members house unfortunately cuz all my extended family is either in venezuela, a long plane ride away, i don‚Äôt know them, or they‚Äôre dead. also if i leave it would hurt my family a lot i‚Äôd rather face the consequences at home. if it wasn‚Äôt for all of that though that would have been a wonderful idea. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
troubledteens,foogmii,t1_fongnzu,1587938598.0,thank you hearing things like this is just what i needed. im glad there are parents out there that understand that even though sunrise can have some healing properties that doesn‚Äôt dismiss the trauma that teens go through. i haven‚Äôt been diagnosed so i‚Äôm not gonna go around saying that i have it but i do have an inclination that i have some sort of mild PTSD from the program. i accept my parents because i know their intentions were 100% pure and in my best interest. it‚Äôs not necessarily what i would‚Äôve chosen for myself but sunrise did keep me from committing suicide and they got what they want out of the program. ever since then i‚Äôve been struggling a lot like feeling like i have control over my life which is why i act out sometimes so i feel like i can reclaim all of that. i hope you know that you are still a wonderful mother. at the time you were just trying to help your child and there are always limitations as to what parents can do to help their child in the moment! sending a lot of love and support your way and if you ever need to talk you can always message me!
troubledteens,fom144z,t1_fol9b0m,1587875476.0,fuck no. I'm 17 and i turn 18 in nine months. My parents have done everything for me and I'm not going to hurt them like that. I'd rather go to maximum security prison till I'm 18 because at least they'll know where I am.
troubledteens,fom11ot,t1_folwtw2,1587875425.0,"Thank you. I think some of the guilt is instilled by the program but a lot of it is just from seeing the pain in my parent's faces when I fuck up they way I do. They don't understand why I keep coming back to drugs and they never will unless they have gotten hooked themselves I just wish they wouldn't talk to me like they knew everything. It just hurts because I grew up in a loving household. I was only bullied a little as a kid, no abuse, no rape, lived in a nice and quiet suburban neighborhood, etc. so it's hard to try and figure out what the underlying issue is but these feelings are real for me and ever since the day I was born I always needed SOMETHING to tame my anxiety. At this point I think it's just the way my brain is wired. I'm just grateful for what I do have but frustrated because I don't know what I'm missing."
troubledteens,fom0qsc,t1_folfucy,1587875197.0,I'm just going to a PHP so it won't be as horrible as sunrise thank god. And yeah I know i'm being exposed n shit but I'm actually less likely to get corona because I won't be going to work anymore so I'll be exposed to the same people instead of whoever decides to come into Starbucks that day.
troubledteens,fom0nkj,t1_fol1iea,1587875132.0,"Yeah i've told them everything. I told them about how they fed us terribly, the fear tactics, the way they treated girls when they made the smallest mistake, and the sexual abuse by the staff. They love sunrise because it saved my life. I'm just going to a PHP though so I won't be dealing with any of that bullshit there. It'll be very different than going to a long term res center. My struggle is mostly because I feel shitty that I have to go to another treatment center for the fourth time and how that impacts my parents. I don't even really care about myself to be fully honest."
troubledteens,fom0hnf,t1_fokpwjw,1587875008.0,"Thank you. Deep down I know that. When I hear stories about people like meth addicts who do stuff that steal money from their families I don't even look at them as bad people. Just someone with a disease that has not learned how to manage it. It just sucks when it's you and you experience the pain that you have caused other people firsthand. I don't think I'm a victim though. Regardless of how hard it was for me to stay clean at the time I chose to buy again, I still had a choice and I had the tools I just chose not to use them. I don't think I am a bad person for making that choice because it's extremely hard to stay clean for me and it's extremely easy to fall back. People don't understand that at all. They just see the external situation which is a teenager lying to her parents and getting high constantly which looks bad but I'm just someone who is really dependent on drugs to be happy and is trying really hard to spread positivity"
troubledteens,fom0143,t1_fol05m8,1587874671.0,Yeah I've told them everything. They still love sunrise because it DID keep me from killing myself. They won't even admit that abuse DOES go on in there which I don't really blame them for. It's not worth it to try to change their opinion on the place because it saved their daughter's life. I never got the worst of the abuse thankfully. And I'm not going to a long term it's just a short term PHP that I am not going to resist against because it'll be in Seattle and they'll treat me more like an adult there and let me make my own decisions.
troubledteens,folztbi,t1_fol272n,1587874511.0,"Thanks so much! I feel like it's still my fault for relapsing because even though it may be harder for me than the average person to keep myself together, doesn't mean that it's not my responsibility to do so. But you're right. It's super fucked because they do everything to act like they understand what it's like but they don't. People that have never tried drugs think that it's simple to stop but it feels almost impossible and they just keep flapping their stupid fucking mouths saying oh just stop it's not that hard take it one fucking day at a time. I can do that for a certain period of time, but all it takes is one bad day. One urge that is not dealt with correctly, to take me down a spiral that leads to a bad place. I am not discounting other people's struggles at all as I understand I was dealt a very fortunate hand in life and I'm extremely lucky. But this is a struggle that I have to deal with and manage and it just angers me when people talk to me in a way as if they understand and give me advice when they don't themselves get it. That's why I try not to offer advice to people who are dealing with things that I don't understand. It's not helpful."

weed,fo9g1d9,t1_fo9fbto,1587618506.0,"yeah my main fear is that they‚Äôll wake up at one point in the night and smell it from upstairs (i sleep downstairs). either that or they come into my room in the morning and smell it lingering in there from the night before. i‚Äôll look into the wax melt too that sounds like a good idea. do you think if i follow those steps of using a sploof, windows wide open for a couple of hours, and add a candle that the smell will be gone within a couple hours?"

Drugs,fn248l0,t3_fslfsi,1586577427.0,"im high rn lol. the idea about the bathroom sounds about good but make sure your parents are asleep. also make sure the vent isn‚Äôt connected to your parents bedroom. if your bathroom has a window, open it wide and get a fan. get something to eliminate the smell or mask it like a candle or actually take a shower after cuz of the shampoo. but yeah getting the smell off of u is pretty easy as long as u don‚Äôt hotbox. just shower and brush ur teeth put on some deodorant n lotion and ur golden. 

u prolly won‚Äôt b able to smoke a whole joint ur first time if it‚Äôs decent weed. but if u happen to finish the joint just flush the filter down the toilet if u do it like once you‚Äôll most likely be fine. joints r pretty smelly though i‚Äôd recommend using a pipe at least. 

as for ur clothes just let them air out for the night and then take all ur laundry out of ur laundry bin and then put the clothes on the bottom of it and your laundry on top. 

to hide it don‚Äôt use plastic and don‚Äôt just double bag. i found a pretty foolproof way is to get a conditioner bottle empty out like half of it and then triple bag your weed and kind of dunk it in there and seal it right. it‚Äôs kind of messy but it works completely. don‚Äôt hide it anywhere other than your room that‚Äôs retarded. not behind your bed either you‚Äôve gotta have a couple layers of coverage it‚Äôs not best to just have it out in the open like that.  and water tank in the toilet is just fucking gross. 

once u smoke you feel it right away after the first exhale. it takes about five minutes to kick in fully which is why people end up smoking too much because they don‚Äôt feel the full effects until later on. if you inhale it right you could get pretty high off of 3-5 hits ur first time. just pay attention to how you feel after each hit it affects everybody different.

your eyes turning red partly depends on how much you cough but there‚Äôs no way to really know till you do it. but eye drops they sell them at gas stations for dirt cheap and they work pretty well after like 10 minutes. but don‚Äôt be high in front of your parents. especially your first time. you don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôll act or feel and if you‚Äôre too high you will probably get very paranoid.

the next morning after i smoke i feel pretty much the same. i guess it‚Äôs different for everybody. if you get very high n black out u probably wake up a little foggy. i actually feel better if i smoke before bed because otherwise i would need my trazedone and i usually wake up super groggy when i take trazedone 

the precautions u should take will probably just be everything i described above. make sure they don‚Äôt hear the lighter flicking. i think the safest way for you to go for sure though is to get edibles but they‚Äôre pretty hard to get where i‚Äôm from. 

for a pre roll it‚Äôs usually like $10-20 depending on the weed n where ur from. 

i understand the issue abt smoking home but it really increases your chance of getting caught. maybe if you have a friend w chiller parents y‚Äôall could sneak out at their place at night?"
troubledteens,fn1zuzi,t3_fyrlgq,1586574194.0,i don‚Äôt like that idea. if my residential did that  i‚Äôm certain that over half the girls will relapse
Safeway,fmgr7dp,t1_fmgdokk,1586055682.0,im literally in the same situation ahaha. I found out my friend works at my location as well and I asked him about it and he said they don't test so it sounds like i'm in the clear

troubledteens,fmfap9v,t1_fm9a9bw,1586023318.0,i just checked the website. apparently the home visits and parent weekends are cancelled and girls are isolated for the first five days of their stay (the last one is complete bullshit) all staff are tested and no one outside of who works there and the girls themselves are allowed inside. i feel really bad for the girls if i was in the position where my home visits or parent weekends were cancelled i would be devastated because that‚Äôs one of the only things that got me through. i can‚Äôt imagine of having to deal with a global pandemic and all the sad things that come with it and on top of that you can‚Äôt see your family. i really hope they‚Äôre ok.
troubledteens,fmajnvc,t1_fm948uf,1585896429.0,That must suck so hard for the girls but it sounds necessary even though it must be so difficult to be isolated like that. Thanks for the response.
troubledteens,fm75fzl,t3_fs0u7a,1585813929.0,RTC was the answer for me. I was constantly putting my life in danger as well and an RTC stopped me from that. There's different things that work for different people though so I can't speak for her. RTC's don't work for everybody despite what they preach.
shrooms,fm74vvs,t1_flzjh2d,1585813345.0,True. It's so fucked.
Safeway,fm346ka,t1_fm0224z,1585712424.0,i‚Äôd imagine lol
Safeway,fm345m2,t1_fm06p64,1585712404.0,bettt. ok i will apply online then. is it easy to get a job there? also about how long was the hiring process?
SuicideWatch,fm05x15,t3_fs5fd2,1585645989.0,I went to treatment for a year and got out. I was doing fine and holding on and ever since the quarantine began shit just got bad. Haven't felt this way since before treatment. You're not the only one. I feel like not enough people are paying attention to it. I've SI'd 3 times in the past week first time doing it since August. I repeat. You are not the only one. I am willing to connect with you. Talk and I will listen.
SuicideWatch,fm05jdl,t3_frqpgh,1585645554.0,Genuinely hope that things get better. I will be thinking about you.
shrooms,flzj2ox,t1_flyw8e9,1585624882.0,"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-brain-food/201912/treating-depression-magic-mushrooms%3famp 
there are multiple articles just like these that cite that magic mushrooms have healing properties. i have also experienced the healing properties of magic mushrooms as well and understand that other people‚Äôs experiences may not be the same as mine. 

the thing you said about opioids being their ‚Äúcash cow‚Äù is so true. i‚Äôve never thought of it that way. the war on drugs is fucked. alcohol had caused wayyyyyy more deaths than psychedelic substances like shrooms and LSD. i can link stats to that as well if you‚Äôd like. i find it fucked how alcohol is widely accepted as societies drug of choice when it causes a lot more physical problems than magic mushrooms do and it has no healing properties. i agree with you fully on how fucked the hypocrisy in the war on drugs is 100%.

i also believe in the legalization of LSD for harm reduction purposes. people create all these research chemicals to get around the law to sell these chemicals and tell people they are ‚ÄúLSD‚Äù when they are actually a substance that can cause deaths such as 25I. LSD has also been the cause of very few deaths and contains healing properties just like magic mushrooms do which is why i think it would do society some good if it was legalized solely because if it was decriminalized by the government, people wouldn‚Äôt have the need to create fake research chemicals for cheaper prices or as a way to find loopholes to the law. Personally though, i don‚Äôt do LSD too often due to the risk of being given something that is not LSD. i‚Äôve made that mistake before and it was stupid of me so now i get a testing kit every time i buy LSD even if i‚Äôve bought from the person before. i‚Äôm not a professional though and there may be some things that i don‚Äôt know so i could also be wrong but this is my opinion based on the information that i have been given and have taken the time to research."
shrooms,flyttwr,t1_flyfdcn,1585608975.0,Thanks for that! I will fs listen to it next time. Yeah I feel like the main benefits come from after the trip because during the initial trip my mind is flooded with all this sensory information that I am constantly working on processing and managing throughout the duration of the trip. It's exhausting but when I wake up the next morning I feel rejuvinated. After my recent shroom trip I have been extremely kind to everyone and I have felt genuine compassion towards people that are struggling and just feel the need to spread love everywhere. The benefits IMO come from holding on to those feelings of love and compassion that you feel during the trip and making the effort to apply that to everyday life :)
shrooms,flytjvy,t1_flynp0l,1585608817.0,I wholeheartedly believe that they should be legalized because they have little to no addiction potential and have been proven to treat depression and even addiction. I am an addict even though I have never done any of the hard drugs like coke or heroin or anything of the sort and whenever I am on shrooms it makes me re-evaluate the shitty decisions that I make and it allows me to take a step back and realize that I need to make a change which is what I am currently making the effort to do.
addiction,flyt3dz,t3_frmgqk,1585608556.0,"Sorry. I literally can't be brutal. I did not have one bad thought while reading this. All i could see from this is that you made it six years and you had only ONE slip up after getting clean from what sounds like the first time getting sober. Even if it wasn't, props to you. I couldn't even stay sober for six months after getting out of treatment and I never even have tried any hard drugs at that point. You had the dedication to stay sober for SIX YEARS. Relapses are just how addiction works. Remember this shame and remorse you feel right now and hold onto it next time you feel the need to shoot up again. 

I mean it was a bad decision. Relapse is inherently selfish within itself. You made a choice that is not in your best interest that hurt the people around you and most of all, yourself just so you could feel that high again for just a couple hours. You need to take accountability for that and make amends to those people and especially yourself.

I tried to phrase it as cruel as I could even though it was hard."
AmItheAsshole,flyedyw,t3_frnc84,1585600592.0,NTA because he never specified he didn‚Äôt want alcohol in the apartment at all. most people that drink even casually typically have a little bit of wine on them or something. he should have told you straight up before. if i were you though i would probably move the alcohol somewhere else as a courtesy to him because it is super hard for an addict to have their drug in the same vicinity as them. but you‚Äôre not exactly obligated to either.
shrooms,flydz1v,t1_fly8rst,1585600371.0,ok i might do that. seems pretty harmless tho from the research i‚Äôve done. but i don‚Äôt think i should be tripping as much as i have been lately.
shrooms,flydv6c,t1_fly8ycz,1585600313.0,ok that‚Äôs good then glad there‚Äôs nothing to worry about
shrooms,flydtwv,t1_fly9ucq,1585600294.0,i didnt sleep last night so that could be it lol. i haven‚Äôt smoked in like two days tho
shrooms,flyds07,t1_flyb3ku,1585600266.0,oh ok good. yeah i imagined. worth it it was one of the best trips ever and i‚Äôve been so much nicer to people ever since
Safeway,fly8pps,t1_flwo66v,1585597601.0,ah shit that‚Äôs good. i‚Äôll probably hold off five days or somn before an interview because it sounds like they do swab tests or something
