People with EDs are very much the minority, and people with anorexia (which, lets be real, is usually what they actually mean by ED) even more so. 

I myself have an ED, more specifically bulimia. Yes, i’m relapsing because of quarantine. No, this does NOT MEAN that others struggle to maintain their weight during this time is any less valid!!!

Please, post about your weight loss. Obesity has a much larger impact on people then EDs- and honestly, it’s not people’s jobs to censor themselves so that a minority isn’t triggered- it’s a sad reality, but it’s reality nonetheless."

I know so many thin people who hate themselves. I have an ED, i’ve been in spaces where people who are literally stick thin cried because of how much they hated their body. I know people who are dead because their hatred of the way they looked caused them to quite literally kill themselves slowly. 

And if anyone tries to tell me that those people were not worthy of the love and support of the body positivity movement because of the fact that they are “already celebrated by society” I will go off my dude. 

And sure- you might say that that’s too much of an extreme example, that people with an ED don’t count, well, let me let you in on a little secret; just because someone has their body shape “celebrated by society” doesn’t mean that they don’t hate themselves, or that they don’t need this movement as much as people of a bigger side do."

But this movement is the BODY positivity movement. 

Not the fat acceptance movement, not the skinny acceptance movement, the BODY positivity movement. Which means that it should be positive to all bodies, and that it should uplift those of all different sizes- not simply those considered typically “large”. 

Moreover, I don’t really think it’s helpful to anyone involved if we start counting our oppression points, yeah?"
