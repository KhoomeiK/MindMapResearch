The truth is **all** retail investors get a pretty bad deal on contracts and pay so, so, so much more for premiums than institutional investors. When used as a primary investment vehicle to tendies, contracts are always a zero-sum game for retail investors unless by some sick stroke of insane luck an institutional investors happen to call upon your shit, over-leveraged position so they can make 100x what you made in tendies alone.

&gt; , what’s the point in me finishing CEGEP if i move to England cause it won’t even be valid there?

Most diplomas can be validated in some way or another.

&gt;  so i’m thinking of maybe dropping out my CEGEP program and moving to England and start a bachelors degree there instead, which would still be valid in Canada if we ever broke up.

So you've got the money lying around? Can you pay the international study fees, and the living costs? If you happen to break up during the year, are you able to afford moving out etc.?

There is so much to think about, but I had a mentor teacher who super micromanaged me and did not give me the freedom to do what I wanted in the class.

Some of the ways my classmates are helping out just doesn't constitute as social distancing. I.e. babysitting DIFFERENT families throughout the week lol way to spread the germs y'all. None of the doctors at the hospital I'm at have accepted this offer since most of them have nannies/babysitters and don't want to get their kids sick from other kids or spread the germs.

Unfortunately, I'm an M3 so a lot of people are gunning hard right now including trying to search out for COVID 19 research projects because and I quote ""it got a case report published in NEJM quickly.""

Holy shit there are a lot of enthusiastic bootlickers in this thread.

For anybody wondering how that would work for their own bank account, it's your net worth (assets minus debts and liabilities) times  0.00045454545 

If you're one of our rich redditors, that's worth say ten million, that's the equivalent of donating about $4500.

If you've got an even million dollars, that's a donation of about $450.

If you're worth $100,000, that's $45.

If you've paid off your student loans and you've got a car and a little cash in the bank and have a net worth of $10 grand, then for you to donate the same equivalentIf percentage of your net worth as Zuckerberg did, you'd have to kick in $4.50, or about a burrito's worth.

If you're just another broke redditor with maybe a net worth of a grand after you subtract your student loans and car payments and whateve, you'd have to kick in forty five cents to donate the equivalent percentage.

Keynesian economics is founded on the idea of economics being quasi-random (specifically, aggregate demand). However, Keynesian economics are also demand-side.

Which one where you singing? My personal favorite:

From the silent depths of darkness  
The pillars have been sleeping for centuries  
They have awakened  
Now the blood, crimson blood  
It summons the valorous to stand and rise up  


\[Pre-Chorus 1\]  
Our inherited love  
It could be called our fate  
Then with your smiling eyes  
Step up to the plate  


\[Chorus\]  
Now you will mystify the night  
Dodge in the blinking of an eye  
Avoid the evil blade, and then find an opening to strike  
Testing your convictions paves the way onto tomorrow  
Like a bloody storm  
You're burning like a bloody stone  
Now the words of destiny are written on your veins  
Immortal and undying, now the bonds of honor rising up again  
Just take a hold of them!  


\[Sax Solo\]  
\[Verse 2\]  
There's a power overflowing  
The marking of a voice left by a friend that you are hearing  
All the pain has been spreading  
Now live for the feelings that you shared, and could be sharing  


\[Pre-Chorus 2\]  
The strength of your will  
Leading the rising dawn  
With noble elegance, sparkling on!  


\[Chorus 2\]  
Onto the mountains, burning bright  
Onto the fire in the skies  
Bring me to the clashing souls that wander in the night  
Pushing through the sadness paves the way onto tomorrow  
Like a bloody soul  
You're burning like a bloody star  
Cutting like a blade through every wind and every flame  
Flowing into you, there is a strength to take you further than them  
Without hesitation!  


\[Bridge\]  
Ripple of destiny  
In your heart, let it resonate  
It is your fate  
\[Chorus 3\]  
Now you will mystify the night  
Dodge in the blinking of an eye  
Avoid the evil blade, and then find an opening to strike  
Testing your conviction paves a way onto tomorrow  
AAAOOOOW!  
Like a bloody storm  
You're burning like a bloody stone  
Now the words of destiny are written on your veins  
Floating and indelible, the bonds of pride, infallible, will burn  
Clasping together!

Lots of LADA (adult onset) are here. ""Type 1.5"" is not an actual designation -- it is more like a way for people to try and explain why they didn't have near-immediate loss of pancreatic beta cell function, as is seen with many children. Some are claiming that there's some kind of cutoff between children below 10 or so, and every other Type 1, but there's little evidence to prove that. There does tend to be a difference between the time to absolutely needing insulin in many people who are older. The ""honeymoon"" period could be weeks or months in children and young teens, and could be years or a decade or more in adults.

Depends on which anarchists you ask. Some anarchists will say any concept of property is a spook, while others may have a formalized definition.

It is in fact a constitutional right (specifically the right to liberty under section 7).

However because the government is making *recommendations* to McDonald's Restaurants of Canada (Limited) in order to protect the right to life of it's citizens, this would take constitutional priority over the right to liberty issue and any legal action against the government would be dismissed on those grounds.

Corporations can't even sue the government for lost business over their recommendations to shut down the dining rooms, for the same constitutional reason (due to social distancing being the best understood practice in the face of the demonstrable threat to life).

It depends on what you mean by crapshoot - reaches?  Or super-reaches (HYPS)?  Applicants need to consider acceptance rates, as well as academic stats, in categorizing reaches, matches, and safeties.

Generally under 20% (I might even go as high as 30%) acceptance rate, I would categorize them as reaches for all, even students with stats over the 75th percentile.

For safeties, well over 50% acceptance rate, preferably &gt;60%. [[Continued...]](https://www.resavr.com/comment/colleges-are-not-crapshoots-14356528)

The relative restraint exercised in war zones by US troops is more impressive than that of cops dealing with fellow civilians in their own country.

Some cops are straight up tribal, arrogant sociopaths who feel like their job makes them our masters rather than our servants. Get a bunch of these people together and they will fortify each other's sociopathy, and protect each other. Like a gang. Cops are members of a gang. They selected being a police officer as a job because they were shitheads as children and wanted authority. When they got that authority, it instantly got to their head and in their mind validated their inflated sense of their own importance that they'd had their whole lives.

A musician is considered professional the moment they accept a paycheck, just like an artist or athlete. Some say they are semi-pro if it's not a career, but they still charge professional rates.

Your assumptions are correct, definitely. In addition to my personal experience as a victim of intimate partner rapes in an abusive relationship. So that, my professional experience, and my gender do inform my perspectives both separately and together.

You ask how I'm concerned - I am concerned because I see your comments as contributing to the minimization of what was done to OP, and I know all too well how minimization - intentional or no - is especially dangerous after an initial assault. You've already discussed some of the themes I'm concerned about with others and I don't wish to have a debate - but the minimization, especially regarding homicide - as well as how you have responded to others who disagree with you.

Sorry the blog but this hits too close to home. 

A good friend of mine has intestinal failure and his doctors currently wont give him IV fluids (their vision being that the risks outweigh benefit) and is having to fight them to convince that living months on the brink of medical dehydration sucks.

He's a young, fierce person who lives Independently, has a career, curiousity and empathy about the world and lot of interests, despite an life-limiting illness thats eaten lot of his time and intestines since childhood.

&gt;There is variance in enemies

Having a couple enemy types from the beginning for a multiple hundred hour game is not variance. Though I guess on a strict definition it is. Still, my point isn't ""There are only single skeleton"" I'm saying nobody will see the dozen enemy types total and think ""Wow this is so varied"" after 10 hours let alone 400. 

And be real, how many varieties of skeletons are there that require ""entirely different tactics?""

There are maybe five here that fit this definition and again you get them all from the start. It's not like there are dozens and you'll never see them early on so it's a constant source of anticipation and mystery, a new puzzle to solve.
