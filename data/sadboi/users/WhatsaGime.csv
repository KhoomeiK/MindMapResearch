I live in Australia and we are doing pretty well, only 3 active cases now in my state - we are entering different stages of opening up now. Thrift stores have started opening again, just with reduced hours and increased health and safety rules for patrons/staff.

Yes, it‚Äôs actually a dietician who specialises in EDs, but they don‚Äôt bulk bill (I live in Australia and bulk bill means the government pays) so I‚Äôve had to wait a while until I can‚Äôt afford it (I‚Äôm jobless and broke lol). But the team really wants me to see them, but I honestly can‚Äôt afford it right this second.

I live in a regional location so this dietician is the only one I can see who specialises I‚Äôm eating disorders. I was sent to a dietician when I was morbidly obese by my doctor before my ED, but they weren‚Äôt too great. I hope this one is better. I‚Äôve heard good things, so here‚Äôs hoping."

I guess there isn‚Äôt a compromise - but I keep working with the team and try to understand that it‚Äôs healthier for me to stabilise, stop the obsessive behaviours, get in a better place and eventually I guess lose weight in a normal way in a normal time frame. But they don‚Äôt even talk about losing weight then, the goal is to stabilise and work on my mental health. 

Yes it is infuriating. I didn‚Äôt exactly 100% choose recovery. My doctor and psychologist became concerned and it kind of spiralled.  But I do want to get better - but I just wana lose more weight lmao. I‚Äôm seeing a nutritionist as part of the treatment soon, so maybe that will help.

EDAnonymous,fqd5juf,t1_fqd4imv,1589280491.0,"Okay so, I started severely morbidly obese. We‚Äôre talking obese class 3, which is the highest BMI category. I lost a bunch of weight quite rapidly through pretty severe restriction, my doctor eventually became concerned, and my psychologist told her about my eating habits and disordered behaviour, so I was referred to a psychiatrist and diagnosed as atypical anorexia. Atypical as my BMI is still in the ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù category. 

I started bingeing and purging about 2 months ago too, so they‚Äôve added a bulimia diagnosis. I‚Äôm slowly stopping that though. 

My recovery is just checking in with a psychiatrist/being medicated, frequent GP checkups, my usual psychologist and I was seeing an ED psychologist too, but that stopped because of COVID. 

My BMI is in the overweight category. So it goes underweight, normal, overweight, obese, obese type 2, obese type 3. In a lot better than I was, and the team all say for my height I‚Äôm a fine weight, but I disagree. But because of my unhealthy thoughts and behaviours, they want me to stop focusing on the weight and food, stop losing weight for now and just stabilise myself physically and mentally - so I can get better. 

It‚Äôs not going great to be honest. Covid messed a lot up, and I‚Äôm so focused on curing the bulimia and holding onto the anorexia and wanting to lose more weight. It‚Äôs hard. 

But yeah. Sorry, hope any of that helped. All recoveries are different, and I‚Äôve still been losing weight and haven‚Äôt been forced into the hospital or anything. I get physical vitals checks and they‚Äôre fine. I guess a pro of being overweight is they don‚Äôt often threaten to force you into the hospital if you‚Äôre still losing weight lol."
