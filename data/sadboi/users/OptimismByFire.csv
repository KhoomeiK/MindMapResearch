BPD,fmn7j4e,t3_fwaf7y,1586219859.0,"I know this feels overwhelming. I hear you saying that you think what you're doing is crazy.

Let's take a second to look at the good things you've done. You recognize the facts of the situation. You recognize when you're spiraling. You recognize that you feel bad when you're in this cycle. You even recognize the best way to address it - with your therapist. 

You are doing awesome. Keep up your DBT. There is a way to live where you're not anxiously obsessing over the past. You are worthwhile.  You are enough. 

I'm proud of you."

The OP is talking about her story though. Let's stay on topic. 


We can certainly talk about the male perspective, but this thread isn't the right venue."
