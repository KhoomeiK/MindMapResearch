I'm sorry you got put in such a difficult situation . I ""nearly killed"" my driving instructor the first time I drove with him. Now I know he was exaggerating I just did a sharp left lol I always think of the 20 hour rule. After 20 hours of practice at anything you will become a novice. See if you're able to drive with a friend or family member first it really helps as you dont feel the pressure of an instructor there. Hang In there man."

quittingphenibut,ezvh5ta,t3_d2fe5e,1568178000.0,"Hello brother,

Hope you're doing well. I've had a big fight with my wife made her cry a lot she even wanted to go to her mothers house. Stupid argument and blew out of proportions. She over thinks things and I just dont care about anything so yea, weird night here too. Have been writing for the past hour all my anxieties and fears are flooding my head.

But onto the point.i will tell you my similar experience. That fateful fight I took a bunch of adderall, scoops and scoops of phenibut. Wasnt counting they were heaps too. 20+ grams. Prior to that I was using 12 grams a day for a year. Kratom daily as well.

Those 20 grams made me into a incoherent zombie so my then gf (now wife) freaked out told my parents (back when I lived at home) and they flushed everything down the toilet. Coming down off of 20 grams, 90mg adderall, and my last kratom dose being 16 hours ago as I woke up that morning to shouts and yells. 

My european parents didnt know a damn thing about phenibut nor did I have any resources on rehab or patient care. I had one day to prepare for who knows what.

The next night I woke up and I'm laying in a wooden lodge. I look around and yeah I'm in a fucking wooden lodge. I get up and walk through the door. All of a sudden I am back in my hallway at home.. must be dreaming still.
As I lay in bed I open my eyes and I'm back in the lodge, my co workers are there. It felt real. I could look around and see decorations and everything

So that's my somewhat funny way of saying. There will be Phycosis. The dreams (nightmares) are hellish.  I was haunted, my family threatened with death, my dirty secrets leaked on the internet.
I woke up from that waking dream and was in fear for my life.

The next morning I was completely fine. Watching tv,  being occupied was completely fine. That same day I went to work with my gf. I waited in her car for her to finish session then the hallucinations began. First there was a man stalking me, felt as if he was putting spider webs over my body to tie me up. Then to my right a house party was happening, my whole family was there. It felt real, but I had no urge to get out of the car to say hello. As my gf got in the car I told her ""look my family is there"" and as i point to the house party there was nothing there but a small house with all the lights off. 

I was unprepared and researched, so I drove back home after she was done with work. Apparently I laughed at a joke her brother told me in the back seat. She said ""hes not here"" I look back and the seat is empty. I thought oh right wtf hes obviously not here. And then as I continued to drive I heard him and he was messing with my seat. But each time I looked back the seat was empty. My gf started crying, having a masters in psych she thought the w/d triggered my schizophrenia. (Dont worry I was back to normal 4 days later. Physcosis came and left as oddly as it had arrived)

Again, being occupied and you're fine I watched tons of Netflix, lost a lot of weight as I didnt eat for a week.

One plus. The phenibut withdrawal and the free flowing anxiety complety negated my kratom withdrawals. I never felt restless leg syndrome. The symptom I despise. (Day 3 had trouble sleeping once the waking nightmares cooled down a bit)

But yea, the dreams are the worst. They're truly haunting. I wore a fitbit to sleep and checking my sleep log in the morning my sleep cycles looked like a an earthquake scale. Constant drips to rem sleep and waking sleep. That's why I was dreaming while technically awake. Never knowing what's real and what's not. 

One of the dreams I was invited to a family party and apparently I went berserk, I was drugged and made a fool of myself. Shit myself, emberrased her etc etc. It felt so real as I woke up I called my parents and told them ""i didnt want to do that i was drugged i did not attack people at that party"" i texted my girlfriend pleading and apologizing for what i did. She replied its 5am you were asleep.

It's as if you have your own nightmare gameleader. There to make your dreams hit all your fears. I would make 12 sleepy time tea bag teas. Slept for an hour and then the waking dreams hit. I would get out of bed go peek out my door. Giving everyone a shock and scare. But trust me I was way more confused than they were. Constantly shifting between dream and my house. Getting in bed and immediately being back in the dream (hallucination) 

Day 4 or 5 the psychosis ceased. All of a sudden it was day 8. Day 13 and by then I was me. The me without any mind altering substances. 

I wrote out the stories to maybe add a little humor and just to take some of the fear away. Tell someone close. Tell them you will be suffering and might be a bit psychotic. To them youd look confused and crazy. Having someone come in and ask how you're feeling when you're on episode 8 of some bullshit show at 4pm. It feels nice. 

I went cold turkey, rubberband off full 20 gram binge and constant 12g use. And I made it through. During the day keep yourself busy. If the dreams torture itll pass. If it's a waking dream. Get up turn on light drink some tea and go on phone. Day hallucinations. First: don't drive lol and try to keep busy

At the end of it all you'll have some fun stories to tell

I wish you the best of luck. You will make it through. Remember: its temporary. It's not onset paranoid schizo, the hallucinations are weird but mostly harmless during the day. Dont go exploring lol otherwise youd just be opening your backdoor four 4 times to an empty corridor thought the night.

In one if the dream I had to perform. We were rehearsing for a play. So i kept getting up out of bed to go to practice only to get inside my hallway and just be like ""ugh fuck""

I know it sounds crazy but you'll see. Itll be quite interesting. Another use for closer friend or family member to tell you where you are and what happened after a dream lol. If you wake up at 4am and think you just got home from a party with a warrant for your arrest.

Text or call over your designated ""phycosis sitter"" so they can tell you that you slept all night and never left the house. :)


Everything will be okay ‚ù§"
