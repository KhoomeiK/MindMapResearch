raisedbynarcissists,fqcvvrt,t3_ghtjyi,1589270713.0,I remember being a freshmen in high school and flinching when 1) my friend suddenly got up to stretch and raised their arms after I said something critical to them and 2) my teacher told me I did a problem wrong and moved his arm. I was really embarrassed in those moments :(
depression,fqbl6h1,t1_fq8sxnc,1589239051.0,"In high school, I assumed everyone went through periods of depression and were suicidal. One day I was having a “deep conversation” with my group of friends from class and I asked them if they ever considered suicide and all 5 of them said NEVER. I asked them again and I was honestly so surprised they had never considered suicide. I really thought it was normal for people of my age to be depressed :( that day I felt so alone."
Guppies,fobg3d3,t3_g6mwrj,1587659430.0,I love the little Kodama! This inspires me to one day have a Ghibli themed tank :D
PlantedTank,fnlsasi,t1_fnl8ko5,1587058862.0,Thanks for letting me know. I wouldn’t want to kill my val!
PlantedTank,fnls1ol,t1_fnkul4a,1587058738.0,Yeah I heard those gel capsules can be a hassle to plant. I’ll check the seachem ones out thank you :)
PlantedTank,fnk5mvv,t1_fnk33oe,1587015681.0,Haha thanks! I’ll definitely be leaving them planted now. I gently tucked the plant and its runner back into the substrate.
PlantedTank,fnk5hwz,t1_fnk4rir,1587015564.0,I only have a liquid fertilizer but I think I’ll invest in some root tabs too!
PlantedTank,fnk38lr,t3_g28iut,1587013668.0,I set up my very first tank 2 months ago. I originally started with fake plants but realized I wanted real plants to make everything more natural. I really like the look of a Valisneria jungle so I got a few plants. They didn’t look like they were doing too well but when I pulled one out there was a runner! I was so surprised but so happy. I think I just need to be patient with my plants :)
tuckedinfishies,fmwld2t,t1_fmva2f1,1586448648.0,"Indeed, that’s why I was confused :p"
tuckedinfishies,fmv9ey6,t1_fmv9853,1586409714.0,Ahhh okay I think that’s it! Yeah the light on that one cory’s body makes it look like it’s comin out of the water. Haha they’re so cute :)
tuckedinfishies,fmuzuny,t3_fx9mww,1586402653.0,Is one above the water?? Haha my mind can not comprehend this image.
AskReddit,fm6vngb,t1_fm4tegj,1585804574.0,Sometimes a completely empty trash can at that!
Aquariums,fm55kh7,t3_ft1ck8,1585766736.0,Woah I only have cherry shrimp so I can’t imagine how big that molt is! Would you mind sharing a picture of what your baby normally looks like? :)
AquariumPorn,fm2z2k8,t1_fm0c7ms,1585708816.0,Amazing growth! Haha so I have hope for my val which I only planted a few weeks ago.
AquariumPorn,fm02flg,t3_fs4kho,1585642061.0,Your vallisneria jungle is beautiful! How long did it take to grow out?
shrimptank,fls7u8w,t1_fls4x0d,1585436213.0,Haha. They’re about 3 weeks old.
shrimptank,flryiu5,t3_fqsueo,1585430564.0,I managed to suck up three shrimplet molts with a pipette!
aquarium,flld8s6,t3_fp50rv,1585258122.0,"Very sturdy, slow grower :) I love your impressive garden!"
shrimptank,fllcuz8,t1_fljwj4z,1585257915.0,Haha this happens with my biggest ghost shrimp who will hold one pellet in her mouth and try to juggle two more while running away.
aquarium,flagxwt,t1_fladi92,1584983659.0,Yeah some of my ghost shrimp were very healthy and lasted longer than my other shrimp but sometimes they only lasted about a week.
aquarium,fl8yh10,t1_fl8yapo,1584935609.0,"Here in my city, ghost/glass shrimp are $0.49 compared to cherries that are $3.99, but cherries are very pretty and easy to take care of. Worth the $3 difference :)"
aquarium,fl8b3z6,t1_fl8apkn,1584919698.0,No problem. Check out r/shrimptank if you need inspiration or advice on shrimps. Best of luck with your nano tank :)
aquarium,fl8ag1x,t3_fn8xj7,1584919293.0,"I would say if your tank’s ambient temperature doesn’t go below 65 degrees Fahrenheit then you can probably keep a small species of shrimp or snail without a heater. I kept my shrimp at 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
The important thing is that the temperature doesn’t fluctuate too dramatically during the day/night because that can stress out your animal friend and kill them."
aquarium,fl77ytj,t3_fmpvit,1584896209.0,Yeah I am new to the hobby and I was always confused as to why snails are considered “pests” when I didn’t see the harm they were doing. My freshwater nerites just started breeding and now I have lots of cute baby snails to look forward to!
shrimptank,fjpwmfu,t1_fjk0p1a,1583562289.0,"I don't really have a set time for feeding my guppies, but maybe a schedule might help with feeding shrimp too. I think I will get those micropellets and see how they work with the guppies and shrimps. Thanks!"
shrimptank,fjjgxj9,t1_fjjet6b,1583395553.0,"Haha I looked them up and they are cute. I’ll look into these feeder options, thank you!"
PlantedTank,fjjdndo,t1_fjjbftd,1583391580.0,"Thanks, I’ll definitely look into it! As long as it doesn’t get too out of hand like I hear duckweed does."
shrimptank,fjjcprf,t3_fdox0w,1583390561.0,"I’m not too experienced with shrimp but I currently have a single cherry shrimp with 4 ghost shrimps and an Amano. They have all gotten along fine. Only the ghosts will fight with each other for food but they don’t seem to bother my cherry. 

My cherry is almost half the size of the biggest ghost shrimp and slightly smaller than the smallest ghost shrimp. 

Additionally, I provide lots of hiding places for all of them using driftwood, rocks, and java moss, so maybe that’s why they all get along."
PlantedTank,fjj6ooz,t3_fdkrcl,1583384883.0,"I love your tank so much! And I love all the species in your tank! May I ask, what’s the plant that has its leaves covering the surface?"
virgin,f9inw2g,t3_e569mg,1575341721.0,"I felt the same way just a moment ago. Maybe it’s because seeing people talk about “still” being a virgin at so-and-so age makes me anxious. Especially when people are so young, it makes me feel like I need to lose my virginity soon and I necessarily want that."
depression_help,f7gj3bj,t3_dw07kd,1573705361.0,"Hi I think I might be facing a similar situation. I’ve been struggling this past year at school and I wish I just had someone to talk to about my problems and feel understood. I think you should let your parents know. They’re your parents and I think they’ll want the best for you. Don’t worry about being a burden with friends and family. True friends will support you when you need it, and hopefully they won’t be selfish enough to think you’re wasting their time. Also I definitely recommend seeing a therapist but feel free to talk to anyone you trust about your mental state! Keeping it to yourself and essentially isolating yourself in your state could make things worse. It doesn’t hurt to get help from others who would offer it to you! Anyways I really hope everything works out and gets better :)"
