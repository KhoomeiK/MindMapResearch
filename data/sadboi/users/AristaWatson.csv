-Did you install any new software or program?

-Any recent accidents for the laptop? Fall? Spill? Screen damages?

-Is your laptop connected with another monitor or is another monitor being used by the laptop as well? Sometimes ppl who use double monitors will forget to remove one from the settings when not in use.

But I think I managed by making new friends and by increasing my self-confidence so I didn't feel guilty about the sudden split in our friendship. Losing a friend, be it online or in person, is painful. But eventually it is going to be less difficult to move on.

For me,  I think I might have focused too much on only good memories and not the everyday bad ones that made me feel like I should leave her myself lol. I can still say I miss my friend but I don't think I would want to be her friend again. I'm sure you have had similar experiences seeing as you two were in a falling out so what I can tell you is to be easy on yourself and grieve how you want over the loss of your friend. Maybe pick up something new to do or talk to other people or even take some time to explore yourself. In the end, you'll move on and so will she and you might have even better friends. :)"

I can only stay for however long without consulting a doctor if I continue to have swelling and pain.

We should never turn down options for help. With depression it might make her feel less motivated to want to go to therapy. But that's where then you will come in to be her cheerleader and motivator. Therapy helps. Therapists/psychologists/psychiatrists are professionals and have a wider array of tools in their kit than us average folk."

As for courses from my uni:
The compsci department in my uni is biased and professors get away with a lot. We never like speak up because technically they do their job. For example, my professor focuses recently on binary trees, sorting, and base switching. He teaches the subjects, technically, but not really for any worth since he tends to be brief and barely touches the surface. For example, he said ""Oh right. Get used to using vectors when sorting, as well as recursion. It helps."" How? How do I do that? We never focused then on how to use vectors, what he means by using them for sorting, any example??? Nothing.

3. They don‚Äôt have for a moment to be pointing the gun at him in order for him to feel threatened.

ACTrade,fp4y29e,t3_gb9aoy,1588310463.0,Make sure to report the person who scammed you so they won't scam others too! I hope you have opportunities to make a million times more and get amazing luck!
ACTrade,fp4wkg8,t3_gb3s49,1588309287.0,My favorite is Sable. She carried so much responsibility on her shoulders from such a young age and grew up to be kind and protective of others. :)
ACTrade,fp4w25f,t3_gb3s49,1588308896.0,My favorite NPC is Sable because she had to grow up too soon and had a rough time growing up with the responsibilities on her shoulders and she still came out so well rounded and kind!
Dodocodes,fp4e1ms,t3_gb8yoh,1588297053.0,Dude NEVER give out your code to everyone. You‚Äôll flood the server!
Dodocodes,fp4dz6k,t3_gb8z90,1588297012.0,May I visit? I don‚Äôt mind for waiting. If there‚Äôs someone more impatient you can let them in before me. :)
COVID19_support,fp4dnhm,t3_gb7cny,1588296817.0,What do you see as the most common causes of death from the virus and what symptoms should people look out for themselves?
COVID19positive,fp3rz3u,t1_fp2vcvz,1588284723.0,Yeah that‚Äôs something what I think of a lot. The fear that for any moment it can get worse is reasonable considering how the virus works. Thankfully it didn‚Äôt. :o
COVID19positive,fp2r4si,t1_fp2hy8v,1588266499.0,"I‚Äôve read a lot about people who have similar symptoms as you do without the cough but with the whole losing sense of taste and smell. Maybe that‚Äôs more than just an uncommon symptom and might be pretty normal for the virus. Also a lot of people report fatigue and aches and GI problems without respiratory distress. It seems it generally will present this way if there‚Äôs a mild case. Which is to in fact say, it may be mild but you don‚Äôt want it lol."
Anxiety,fp2qk09,t1_fp2pta5,1588266219.0,Oh. Yeah I know I sometimes don‚Äôt get that kick from exercise but usually I do. If it ever in a way stops giving me the release then I will ask my psychiatrist about other options as well. So far exercise for me is helpful but it‚Äôs mainly because I also have ADHD so exercising could be scratching that itch mainly and not just anxiety. That‚Äôs what I may think as a lot of people with anxiety don‚Äôt seem to get much better with exercise from what I‚Äôve read from other accounts on Reddit.
ACTrade,fp13pvi,t3_gapiiq,1588223561.0,Can I visit?
COVID19_support,fp0tc92,t1_fp0t54n,1588216465.0,You‚Äôd still need masks so as to protect people from getting it if you do or if you don‚Äôt know you have it. Mass testing is for deciding how widespread the virus is and how fatal it is. Masks are for a general use to protect ourselves. There won‚Äôt be much tests or at least not enough to test EVERYONE. Until an effective and successful treatment is found or a vaccine is made masks are the safest bet.
COVID19_support,fp0sgni,t1_fp0pu1i,1588215912.0,Yup. Hoping we stay safe!
