GEazy,fmko37y,t1_fmjl3tw,1586161941.0,It’s in my top three. SO wonderful
GEazy,fmko2cs,t1_fmju0av,1586161915.0,“The text bubble popped up then disappeared again” always gets me
TheSocietyNetflix,flwszzr,t3_frkaer,1585563975.0,"My first thought seeing the show was that they escape the society when they die. That’s why capital punishment actually wasn’t a punishment and that they are on the other side. But I don’t know, it was just my gut feeling"
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fla6oqs,t3_fn2x9k,1584977789.0,You must have back pains from carrying the whole show man
Anxiety,fl19m75,t1_fl0v3rw,1584724681.0,"Same, when it gets too much all of a sudden I sometimes throw up.."

OneDirection,fkhiwsw,t1_fkhipgh,1584199904.0,"No, Louis’ mom did"
OneDirection,fkh5w5v,t1_fkgwvwh,1584189687.0,I think you have mixed up Zayn with Louis... Louis’ mother passed away sadly
OneDirection,fkgvux8,t3_fidyss,1584176850.0,"I love Zayn as well - but his behaviour after leaving the band has at times been problematic. His music as a solo career is absolutely wonderful and I support him 100%. I think he has a lot of issues with anxiety and so on after cancelling shows etc, so I understand that he hasn’t been as “open” with the fans as the other members."
OneDirection,fkgvqx1,t1_fkgpxpt,1584176694.0,The ”Let Niall Sing” hysteria was worth it just so this masterpiece could be created
OneDirection,fkfre3i,t3_fi4wl6,1584140743.0,Fools gold!!!
