But some of us come from more conservative backgrounds with stricter parents, and they instill us with different values. There’s nothing wrong with that. 
Don’t make us feel like shit for holding what to you might classify as “traditional” values."

TalkTherapy,fpo7q2h,t3_gb5io9,1588779826.0,"Wow. I might get downvoted for this, but my situation actually happened the other way around. After telling my (old) therapist about my suicidal ideation and attempt I had—-she laughed at me. She then proceeded to tell me she didn’t “understand” my problems and belittled me for feeling the way I was feeling. Noticing I was crying after this, she didn’t stop to ask why. Nope, she just continued on ridiculing me & asking me for the bloody + graphic details of all my methods and attempt until I was in completely shattered. 

Oh well. I guess you’re very lucky having a therapist that truly listens & empathizes with you. Sweet story. 
I just wish all therapists were that way."
ApplyingToCollege,fl6xuvy,t1_fl6trga,1584887251.0,"Thank you for the helpful information.

Yes, pre-med is something I am keen on doing. I would say it’s a mixture of my wishes as well as my parents, so I’m okay in that aspect. 

Also, concerning those AP courses, would getting say a B or C be viewed negatively by colleges? I’ve taken Honors Biology as a prerequisite for AP Biology, but something such as AP Lang is not per se my intended “major”. Could that potentially throw off a few colleges if I were not to get the best score?"
ApplyingToCollege,fl6xfpf,t1_fl6kq23,1584886762.0,"I’ve heard of “self-studying for AP exams” before. I think the only downside is just that you have to wait until May to take the actual exam. It also wouldn’t show up on the transcript as a class, of course.

It’s also stressful knowing you must be competent enough in all areas to be a good enough candidate for colleges, including LOR’s and exams like you said. Just definitely a lot to focus on! Thanks for the response."
exmuslim,ff887w6,t3_es4nf3,1579668828.0,"Yeah I went to that type of oppressive Islamic school a while ago. They claimed halloween was haram, long nails, makeup was haram also. Yet the whole school ate haram meat and was homophobic and racist as hell. I don’t know how I come out the way I did, but trying to filter out their BS after I came home helped a bunch.  Try to anonymously complain about them or something along those lines. Considering how Islam-hating most of America is, it shouldn’t be to difficult to make a case against them if they really are abusing their power."

exmuslim,fcjv7mm,t3_ehhxr5,1577706361.0,"You’re technically not even Muslim from the way you’re describing yourself and your habits, if you don’t feel Muslim, don’t be one. You’re just giving yourself a wrong label and other muslims will attack you for it. I’m Pakistani too, and you have no idea how lucky you are. My mom doesn’t even let me tuck in my shirt into high waisted jeans because it’s “sinful” and provocative (whatever that means). Art is haram. Not to mention guy friends are out of the question. 
If you truly don’t want to be muslim or whatever, don’t force yourself to do something you don’t want to."
SuicideWatch,fb990ag,t1_fb8phbr,1576632471.0,"No, they absolutely do NOT need to see a doctor. If they’ve survived this long on their own, they can survive much longer. without any abuse from hotlines or doctors. Suicide is extremely misunderstood, and you’re not helping by neglecting someone’s thoughts and emotions and writing it off as “needing help”. There’s only so much that can be done. Medication does not help. It simply  fixes chemical imbalances such as  ones from depression, but who told you that suicide is a form of depression? It’s not. Go inform yourself and develop some god damn empathy before spouting such bullshit."
SuicideWatch,fb98j52,t1_fb92lol,1576632117.0,"Yup. Fuck therapists. They want money, they couldn’t care less about us. The last time I admitted my suicidal ideation to a therapist, I was asking her sincere opinion on how I should cope with these horrible thoughts and urges. She then told me to list all top five of my planned suicide methods. I only had three, but she forced me to list five and laughed at all of them. She even said I had no reason to be suicidal. But when I did list my reasons, she looked me straight in the eyes and said “I can’t do anything for you, sorry.” She got my mom in the room in the end and made her cry, by listing the methods in gruesome detail. But my mom didn’t know I was suicidal, so the therapist then accused my mother of parental neglect and called child protective services on her. I could go on, but to say it simply, nobody cares. If things get too complicated, they all just back off and give you some hotline, or shove about 10 cops and say they saved someone’s life."
SuicideWatch,fb97owf,t1_fb74leu,1576631493.0,"EXACTLY. nobody knows how to correctly respond to someone who reaches out for help. You just get the same old rehearsed statements over and over and over again. This system is corrupt it’s almost a joke. The words these people choose are important. Especially when someone is dedicating their time, money, and effort into trying to get you to understand them. 
(And they wonder why suicide rates have been rising)"
SuicideWatch,fb96v6f,t3_ebspd5,1576630881.0,"Even then, nobody cares. I literally get dragged to abusive therapists against my will by expressing a normal emotion, that I don’t know what to do anymore. I say I have nothing left, nothing to work for, I don’t even know what direction my life is heading and if I want it or not. Everything is directly translated into, “oh? So you’re suicidal? Tell me more so I can admit you to a mental hospital, instead of helping you sort through these normal emotions.”  Even when admitting I want to die, it’s the same response. Amazing kind of support, am I right?"
socialanxiety,fb27mw5,t3_eau052,1576446557.0,"First of all, the things you’re describing are not pathetic. They are things people with social anxiety experience on a daily basis, and there is nothing wrong with them. Therapy doesn’t help with SA disorders because trouble opening up doesn’t work with talk therapy. Therapists are also ill informed and confused on how to treat these patients, so they’ll just shove a workbook in your face and call it a day. So don’t waste your money on them. Also, there are different intensities to social anxiety: slight, mild, severe, etc. You probably do have a mild case of SA. To start, Try identifying your triggers and working on finding what makes you stressed about this new area or its people."
socialanxiety,fb25myl,t3_eb4vn1,1576445768.0,"Once thousand times yes. I know for me personally, I’ve suffered my entire childhood with social anxiety without even knowing it. I had no siblings and my parents didn’t believe in these types of “disorders” so they let me stay sheltered and thought nothing of it. Of course then I didn’t get the social exposure I needed, and therefore I’m now socially crippled. Horrible social skills, awkwardness, on top of being horrified of people and social interaction is miserable. You end up realizing your problems are intertwined with each other and you don’t even know where to begin untangling the knots."
pakistan,f3wjqb2,t3_bfhos2,1571205342.0,"I know this is an old post, but those helplines don’t do shit. Maybe works for temporary problems rather than actual suicidal ideation, but other than that- shit. I’m speaking from personal experience, they’re abusive and a waste of money. And lastly, stigma will never be gone because it’s linked with religion. Those things go hand in hand, and you can’t eradicate one without eradicating the other."
