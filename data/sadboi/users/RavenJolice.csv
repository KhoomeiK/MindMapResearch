depression,f86y379,t1_f86vnvo,1574309893.0,Is there a specific reason they have stated? Some people are very judgemental. For me it was that people saw someone who's shy but good-looking (that's how they've stated it) and immediatly thought I was arrogant. So either there is something people judge about when they first meet you or you're just surrounded by assholes.

I had quite a few friends like that. Unfortunately, the worst ones were the ones I was friends with the longest. One boy I was friends with for 4 years (with huge breaks in between though) who had an unrequited crush on me and for that tried (and still tries) to make my life hell. And this one bitch who had a terrible home situation and used me as her personal punching bag for almost 6 years straight. Glad I just recently cut both of them off for good, tired of people pushing me around because I used to be very warmhearted and naive. Wanted to make a reddit post in both of them (and another person who I never considerd my friend, but was friends with both of them and was in my life for a while and always poured gasoline in the fire when I had problems with those other two) but haven't done it yet because the storys are soo long and I plan on pouring out every little detail because it really damaged my mental health. Sorry for blurting that out of the blue rn, but I really needed to get it off my chest.

Ok 1. of all, the college getting involved because she begged people for money and called them selfish sounds like a little too much don't you think? 2. How long was that girl even pregnant? All the things that happend before their marrige weren't in a short period of time and still, you want to tell us that she was only 3 months pregnant? 3. In one part of the story Sally talked about you waking the baby. I don't belive they had a baby already, and the second child was the misscarrige, it wasn't mentioned anywhere that she gave birth, and you put so much details in the story, I doubt you would forget something so important if it was true, also she described as pregnant the whole story until she had the misscarrige. 4. She sending you nudes really sounds like male wishfullfillment and makes this story seem really fake. 5. The cousin randomly agreeing to go on a date with you sounds like male wish fullfillment: the sequel. 6. Okay darlin... So you want to tell me they didn't look at the slideshow before they showed it and that no one stopped the slideshow when they noticed it's contents? 7. The conversation with Robbie seems fake because it's in full sentences. No one can remember 100% of a conversation especially when it's pretty long one with long sentences. That's why people only describe what was being sad. That pretty much gave it away already but the last part... 8. Liver- and Kindneyfailure AND a misscarrige? A little much at once, don't you think? Also she really had to be a reeeeaaaally heavy drinker for that and you don't get Liver- AND Kindneyfailure from a few wine bottels but well.

This is really just r/thathappend. Sounds like a fanfic and not even a good one."

I asked him about it and he said that he was ""just hanging out with people he knew from there and ist just trying to make new friends"" so I just hang out with my roommates.
