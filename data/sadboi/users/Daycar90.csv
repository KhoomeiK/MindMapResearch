Anxiety,fdtkflh,t1_fdthcrx,1578718041.0,"Not going to lie I’ve had both good and bad experiences in ERs getting meds, unfortunately depends on the doctor you get and little to no controlling that. When you go in and see triage nurse just explain that you don’t have a family doctor and have been struggling with mental health and wanted to talk with a doctor about starting on medications or getting referral to mental health services. They likely will ask some very blunt questions right away to assess urgent-ness eg. “are you having suicidal thoughts?”, “are you self injuring?”, etc. generally you’re then sent to registration desk and then back to wait room. You’re going to low priority unfortunately so bring a good book or something to do. You’ll eventually be called in and given a room/bed where you’ll probably wait some more and then eventually see another nurse and finally a doctor. If you think it would help make a list of symptoms, things you think a doctor should know, questions you may have because often when you do see doctor they can be very rushed and I find under pressure it can be tough remembering everything you wanted to mention/ask."
Anxiety,fdsweon,t3_emwmv8,1578708816.0,"While I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life, university was when I first sought help for it. The doctors in health services at my university were so amazing, right away I was told if I ever was having a hard time with deadlines and getting assignments done to come in and they would give me a note no questions asked. Even after being told this I still struggled taking advantage of this, I would be up all night before a due date trying to get things done and being having full blown panic attacks and still be convinced I didn’t need the note, generally wasn’t until the early hours of the morning that I would finally admit to myself it either wasn’t getting done or if it was it wasn’t going to be the work that I knew I was capable of doing. Looking back I wish I had taken advantage of all the services more because I think I would have been so much less anxious and therefore might have gotten to need them less instead of being constantly stressed and anxious about the idea of being stressed and anxious (anxiety spiral much!). So basically my advice is take advantage of all the services, allow yourself some room to breathe, university is tough enough already, don’t make it harder than it has to be."
