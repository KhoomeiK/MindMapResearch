SSDI,f23qie3,t1_ez9t3hs,1569934855.0,Did you get your $?
SSDI,ezx0w2b,t3_d2okf7,1568229547.0,DENIED!
SSDI,ezwa7u6,t1_ezw18f7,1568211901.0,Thanks.  I read it but have issues registering.  I never get emails.
SSDI,ezw0xvq,t1_ezvznup,1568204708.0,Thank you so much.  I know I am reading too much into it.  It changed from 5:00 am to 7:00 am.
SocialSecurity,ezb8oz3,t1_ez7699o,1567815509.0,J got the same message today.  Hoping for a positive outcome.  I turn 60 in a month.  I've read that some people have to wait for the next age range to qualify.  They got benefits but had to wait for birthday and that was inset date.  Did you ever hear of this?
SocialSecurity,ezal30d,t1_ezag46e,1567803353.0,"Hey - you helped me many times!  Thank you.  I just got the same message today.  The last step was a Psych Eval.  The results were in on 08/30. My guy called me yesterday with one question about a doc follow-up.  I called back today and he said he didn't need it.  A decision was made. 

Is this a usual step?  This didn't happen the last time."
SSDI,ez9sgfs,t1_ez87oys,1567788684.0,Thank you I looked it up.  I have a high school education and worked office jobs for 40+ years so I guess that means I am skilled.
SSDI,ez9s5jg,t1_ez9n7qw,1567788539.0,"Are you waiting for $$$ ?  I applied in late March so if I do get approved-I won't get any back pay but who cares?   My poor husband is 66 and retired but still works full time as a landscaper and does side jobs.  I am going to try to be patient-I will start waiting for the mail on Monday.  Yes, I will be that person who sits in my chair waiting for the mailman.  Good luck-I hope everything works out for you and your puppy."
SSDI,ez9rl1y,t1_ez9n3y9,1567788249.0,Thank you.  Hopefully mine is.  I have had 30 jobs in 10 years so it's obvious I kept trying.  I never had a job longer than two months before I imploded.  The shortest was 4 hours...I saw someone I worked with at a failed job...She told HR I was a psycho and I was asked to leave before lunch.
SSDI,ez9kn3f,t1_ez97bds,1567784399.0,How old are you? I'm hoping my age will work in my favor.
SSDI,ez9kit5,t1_ez9ifh5,1567784328.0,Thank you.  I am the most negative person ever...but I am optimistic about the outcome.  Maybe my advanced age will help.  The thought of being homeless terrifies me.
SSDI,ez99nnc,t1_ez97bds,1567776871.0,Thank you.  A decision has been made - I have to wait for the letter.  I can't imagine waiting another 18 months - financially or emotionally.
SSDI,ez8x2l9,t1_ez8h444,1567764317.0,"""Sighed dramatically""."
SSDI,ez8w6xt,t1_ez8gg01,1567762998.0,She clicked the boxes saying my mental state affects my ability to work though.
SSDI,ez8w5hr,t1_ez8gg01,1567762938.0,No.  They wanted to be denied twice.  Dramatic really bothered me too.  I was a nervous wreck.
SSDI,ez7nlmt,t1_ez71a99,1567725987.0,I have to pursue this but I dread the next steps...getting a lawyer and appealing and appealing...
SSDI,ez70sm9,t1_ez6ocm1,1567717453.0,A nurse I said it was between critical and stable in a medical setting.  She might be wrong but it sounds like a catch-all phrase.  It was a prognosis.  I hate this process so much.  I stayed up all night reading this report.
SSDI,ez6hvjg,t1_ez68xjm,1567712412.0,Yeh - I wasn't sure what guarded meant.  I can't get a clear answer when  I Google it.
SSDI,ez60dk6,t3_d02oyt,1567707585.0,Oops sorry. It was in the SSA Grid Rules...not a diagnosis.
SSDI,ez5qqeu,t1_ez5kaps,1567703254.0,"Good frickin question.  It was one of the jobs that said I could do.  It wasn't in my denial letter, it was in the info from their file I picked up yesterday.  It also said I didn't reach the age grid because I was 59 and 8 months old.  Now ai am 59 and 11 months old.  Hopefully I fit into the 60, crazy and useless category.  I hate my fucking life right now."
SocialSecurity,eyhwx1n,t1_eyhraqf,1567093971.0,"Don't.  If this person is already making your life hell, you are setting yourself up for much worse.  Question-are you really concerned about him taking government funds or do you want revenge?"
Anxiety,eya9sln,t3_cwer7t,1566960258.0,I can't believe you asked this question.  I have been scratching my hands and feet until they bleed.  I just.started doing this.
SSDI,exy9nmc,t3_clp22i,1566649176.0,I hope I don't have another experience with a SSA doc.  I did see my therapist again yesterday and it went well.  I think she took my 'speech' to heart.
SSDI,exqvppg,t1_ew2aaza,1566507756.0,"I had a psych exam Monday.  The doctor was a stone cold bitch...but when I told her briefly about my therapist she paid attention. I told her how hard it is to get therapy - what insurance covers, etc...I have a car and a house (oh the horror) so didn't qualify for charity."
SSDI,exqtonz,t3_c88nd0,1566507066.0,"I had mine on Monday.  I was very stressed and didn't sleep. Had to Uber it cos of fear of driving in the city.  I arrived an hour early.  The female doctor who did mine was robotic.  I swear she wouldn't recognize me in a line-up.  She never looked at me.  Lots of number tests and remembering words.  It was more of a cognitive exam than mental in my opinion. She asked me to define Bipolar.  I'm bipolar 2 so my symptoms are milder.  When it was over she slammed my folder on her desk and . I had papers out, all of my pills,my book, water and was attempting to put it all back in my bag and She once more said ""you're done"".  Bitch."
SSDI,exqnr1d,t1_exg8v6k,1566504920.0,They don't change the website.  They changed mine to denied only after they send the letter.
Anxiety,exkdjdk,t3_ctf5mj,1566385564.0,Good luck!  Day 2 is always better.  Just get through today!
bipolar2,exgh0zd,t1_exfq8a8,1566263852.0,It made me laugh you hid something from yourself!  I hid my husband's RFC he wrote about me.
bipolar2,exg1x8q,t3_csgquc,1566253592.0,I did it.  She was robotic.  She showed absolutely no emotion.  Didn't look up once.  I'm happy to be home and well stocked with food - I don't have to leave for days.
bipolar2,exel0jb,t1_exegqdf,1566218752.0,Yes. Sorry if that term is rude.  No sleep for 3 days. I talked so fast I scared people at work. I started at 8 and stood at the door for an hour for security to open the door.
bipolar2,exeg35s,t3_csfjae,1566213937.0,Antidepressants made me crazy.  All of them. That s how I was diagnosed with  BP2.  Taking Lamictal.
Anxiety,ex63o81,t3_crjraj,1566038356.0,"I always feel more anxiety after a night of drinking.  It's strange, it even happens when I was at home with my husband so I'm not worried I made an ass out of myself in public.  I made an ass out of myself at home."
Anxiety,ewygqhq,t1_ewy96no,1565880786.0,Welcome.
Anxiety,ewy5a1v,t3_cqpcpc,1565875014.0,Happy Birthday.  I know you feel because sometimes I don't want to be around people.  But...If an option is to bring a cake to your house - try to do that.  It will make your mother happy...remember she gave birth to you. I would give a limb to spend one more day with my mother.
Anxiety,ewv08t4,t1_ewupoqr,1565795753.0,Me too.  I have the opposite effect too - Benadryl makes me speed.
Anxiety,ewv02vy,t3_cq9dir,1565795647.0,"I have felt all antidepressants within a day or two.  It turned out I am bi-polar 2 and they were making me manic. I know they say give it a few weeks, but I never could.  As another poster said, I am sensitive to meds."
Anxiety,ewuzrp7,t3_cq9sbk,1565795449.0,"I'll be 60 in October and it's a no for me.  As someone said on another thread, I didn't know worrying about everything wasn't normal.  Laid-back people amaze me but I don't think they worry enough so I worry for them!
For me, I think I worry more now because I have alot to lose.  I worry about my health, my husband's health (he's all I have-I ran my family and friends away years ago).  I wish I could say it's getting better."
bipolar2,ewtswzs,t1_ewtqlmg,1565753183.0,Talking to people and reading about their lives on Reddit has really helped me.  We all feel like we are alone with our problems.  Lots of people feel the same.

bipolar2,ewtnlh1,t3_cq2g6u,1565749480.0,"Me! Me! Me!  I'm 59 and have lost 30 jobs in 10 years.  I can't control my mind, emotions and anger.  I hate myself 24/7."

bipolar2,ewtmrc1,t3_cq33p2,1565748885.0,"I was diagnosed with BP2 when a long list of antidepressants made me manic and I tried lamictal and it was magic!  I wasn't diagnosed until my late 40s. Looking back, it makes so much sense.  I have dealt with depression forever.  My mania is rapid speech, irritability and then full-blown rage."
SSDI,ewj3qme,t1_ewi44z7,1565460897.0,Thank you very much.  Anxiety is kinda my thing - I'm really good at it. I keep reading horror stories about the doctors remarks.  I guess it depends on the doctor and what their mood is like that day.
SSDI,ewht6ql,t1_ewheod3,1565421152.0,I usually don't get out of bed either.  What things did they pick up on?  I know I am being a pain with my questions.

bipolar2,ewctz4p,t3_cnq3wf,1565290305.0,Personally I love Lamictal.  I take 350 mg. A day.
Anxiety,ew2v1zb,t3_cmj1c1,1565056585.0,I feel exactly the same way.  I go over everything I said all day. I have cut myself off completely from everyone. Honestly I am happier this way.
SSDI,ew2u9md,t1_ew2ttt8,1565056017.0,Thanks - I didn't say that paperwork!  I'm having a hard time with this.  I am humiliating.
SSDI,ew2sbk3,t1_ew2mtgk,1565054613.0,"I will hire a lawyer if denied.  If I had been approved from initial app, I wouldnt have received money until August so I wasn't desirable for an attorney anyway.  They wouldn't have made money.  I talked to a big law firm that specializes in SSDI and a small office.  Both asked me how many suicide attempts I had.  Duh...obviously not enough."
SSDI,ew2kdsj,t1_ew2i712,1565048920.0,I applied March 19. Denied June 11. Filed for reconsideration on July 1.  I had not seen a therapist for a few years.  I don't think they help me.  I lose it at work - can't hold a job.  I need someone to sit next to me all day to keep me calm!!  The whole 45 minute thing is hard..I just get rolling and I am booted out.  I'm not sure what form she has - possibly one to confirm I was there.  They never sent a form for my husband to fill out.  I asked for one & he is filling it out now.  He is the only person I am in contact with...poor guy.
SSDI,ew2fbqw,t1_ew2aaza,1565045288.0,I hope they do send me to their psych doc.  I thought of finding a doc that does evaluations and paying for it myself. I am so frustrated. It took me forever to go back to counseling.  I am limited with who I can see based on insurance.  Maybe things will be better this week.
SSDI,ew1x5qw,t1_evwxhj0,1565033425.0,"Thank you.  That is what I decided to do.  I am going to ask her for a copy.  I also received advice to write my questions down.  I need to know why she never takes notes.  It's a problem, I have to keep repeating myself at $1 a minute.  I am also going to ask for a later appointment.  She can't get it together at 9.   I'm already anxious about my next appointment Thursday."
SocialSecurity,ew1s40o,t3_ckq850,1565030210.0,"This makes me insane!  I have read stories that someone dressed nice for their hearing and denied because they looked 'put together'.  It's all subjective. There are no rules and no one is held accountable.  They use their personal life experiences to make decisions.  Perhaps his ex is depressed and he's pissed off about it.  
God I hate this process."
SocialSecurity,ew1qham,t1_evt80ah,1565029161.0,Do you normally read any paperwork submitted by applicants or just the medical portion.  Applied for mental health and sent info based on blue book descriptions.  I babbled.  I can tell my contact is a very young man.  Will he trash it?
SocialSecurity,ew1q9aq,t1_evt64j7,1565029020.0,"Hi - I have a question.  I am in the reconsideration stage for a mental health claim...59 - bi-polar - anxiety depression.  I applied myself.  I contacted two lawyers to discuss my case.  Both of them asked how many suicide attempts I had...like that was a good thing.  Is this normal? 
Also, is my age a factor? Turning 60 in October and worked since I was 16.  Since 2015 I have been fired from 10+ jobs...I never lasted longer than a month."
Anxiety,ew1p0j6,t3_cmecnn,1565028226.0,I have been having more anxiety than usual and I have had constant headaches and neck pain.  I'm old as f*ck though and have cervical issues.
Anxiety,evzmudn,t3_cm042m,1564961749.0,SSRIs made me manic.  Tried so many. I take Lamictal and it works.  I could be wrong but I think there are less side effects.
bipolar2,evw3pr2,t3_cll3nf,1564854347.0,"I know exactly how you feel...
In my case, I hate myself so I think everyone does.

bipolar2,evu8700,t1_evtsnhm,1564788147.0,I don't feel like I ever get adequate training which increases my stress.  I can't stand people staring at their fricking phones all day.  I wrote another post today about my new therapist.  She knows I hate the phone thing (being ignored) and she kept looking at her phone.  Not glancing- obviously reading something.
bipolar2,evu7vdl,t1_evtvoe9,1564787908.0,"I don't know how to explain it.  My resume is a total lie because I had to remove all of those short term jobs.  I got hired for a job and by noon, I saw someone I worked with at job where I had a meltdown and was fired. The office was all glass and I saw her go into HR.  I was 'let go' an hour later.  You can't be honest and say on an interview  - I'm qualified but I may scream, cry & run out of the building. Hire me."
Anxiety,evtogwn,t3_cl8ptm,1564774817.0,I've been there and it sucks.  I can't talk myself out of it.  I wish I could give you a cure.  I'm a movie person and sometimes I can watch something to take my mind off me and before I know it - I'm better.  Xanax helps too.
bipolar2,evthybl,t3_cl7of0,1564770786.0,Me!  30 jobs in 10 years.
Anxiety,evspl6j,t1_evsorpo,1564753202.0,I do plan on reporting her.  It's hard enough to seek therapy.  It's not fair to myself and others they don't get her attention.  I already don't want to go next week.
Anxiety,evspbhr,t1_evsorpo,1564753011.0,"That is excellent advice to address it. I should wait next week.  Part of my issue (and keep losing jobs) is being confrontational.  I like her on a personal level, which makes it hard."
Anxiety,evso961,t1_evso1kd,1564752233.0,Thank you.  She is in the process of filling out reconsideration paperwork for my SSDI application.  I haven't seen a therapist because I usually hate them and they hate me!

SocialSecurity,etxaoh3,t3_b4glls,1563295238.0,So you paid $6K out of pocket?  If it only took 2 months you wouldn't have had backpay.

59 bi-polar and recent cervical herniated discs, spinal stenosis, DDD.  

My agent said my advanced age, in addition with physical issues sitting at a computer screen may work in my favor.
