And one woman call because of abcess under her arm.  Said the reason she had to go to the ER instead of her doctor was that her own doc would ""make it worse"" by giving her antibiotics that would just cause it to not drain on its own.  Not only that, but after calling 911, she made the ambulance wait. She was in the bathroom.  Came out with a cigarette.  Then had to call for her brother to come take her cigarette.
