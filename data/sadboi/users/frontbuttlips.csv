BPD,fqlw9ke,t3_gjfzwi,1589467235.0,"Mine is a combination of my parents tumultuous relationship and abusive relationships I was in, during formative years. I would say that my the abusive relationships were really where things truly went bad for me. Everyone has a difference in what caused their BPD & I think that’s why it also causes a lot of us to wonder ‘why?’ a lot. It’s not actually all black & white, there are grey areas everywhere <3"
BPD,fonq9o7,t3_g856o2,1587924360.0,"My memory is really bad and patchy in random areas. When I’m under intense emotional stress, it’s even worse. I don’t know if anyone else experiences this either but I find it extremely hard to focus on what people are saying when I am in these moments."

I am in that phase of early motherhood where all of my obsession and focus is now on my young child, and it is usually not a negative thing. My FP prior to this is actually still an extremely close friend- we went through some toxic drama for sure but I’m lucky to have found a friend who genuinely loves me and wants me to be as mentally well as I can be <3 we were lucky"
AspiePartners,fo7hz3e,t1_fnz3rim,1587578652.0,It’s definitely not going to be typical but you will both find a parenting style that works for you! New life comes with so many emotions and they are valid any way you look at it. Best of luck to you ❤️
AspiePartners,fnvy681,t3_g3xg6t,1587307477.0,"My partner (33 M ASD) wasn’t diagnosed until recently, so we went through pregnancy without many “tools” so to speak. I (F 24 Nonspectrum) struggled badly. He WAS supportive, but I didn’t feel very supported, because it wasn’t the way I imagined it. He would not touch my belly at all, he was afraid to. That hurt me a lot, I wanted so badly for him to feel our baby kicking and growing. I mourned the loss of my old life A LOT and he just... had a tough time comforting me. It’s a lot, I think, to be ASD and support a pregnant woman who is dealing with SO MUCH & I couldn’t even express my struggles to him. Those 9 months were basically one HUGE miscommunication. He is now an extremely wonderful, attentive father and we have healed so much. But, we almost split up many times during my pregnancy. Now, I feel like we are intensely bonded, because the struggle was there for BOTH of us. He was amazing during birth. I had no idea if he would be able to handle being there, but he was LOVELY. And, he loves our daughter with every bit of himself. It’s been very healing to PARENT with him, but pregnancy really sucked. I hope this wasn’t too scary to read... I know now, if we had another, we would be able to face things differently."
BPD,fnsxe6o,t3_g1llaz,1587230613.0,"dae doubt their reasons for being BPD? Like, ehh, maybe I made it all up and I’m not THAT fucked up, just like... fucked up enough to have everyone hate me...?"
AspiePartners,fnswn5a,t3_g3cf30,1587230204.0,"I think Aspies struggle to recognize emotional needs. But, I think it’s entirely possible to have emotional needs met by an Aspie... it definitely takes both parties being up for a bit of extra communication to get those needs met."

Hate it about myself and it’s like fighting every instinct I have to NOT manipulate & “play a part” in my relationships. So, I’m trying to see the bragging as more of a coping mechanism than anything. Gives BPD a bad rep tho"
BPD,fn7jlvz,t1_fn7ih3j,1586721635.0,Most with BPD don’t want to be doing this & in fact have been abandoned on more than one occasion. It’s not fun.
BPD,fmm4phl,t3_fvs1hi,1586198746.0,I would watch that. I am not diagnosed but... relate to pretty much everything BPD related. I’d really appreciate another way to educate myself and feel less alone.
BPD,fmm3j04,t3_fvyo35,1586198114.0,I do feel guilty even tho my partner doesn’t want me to. I do anyways.

AspiePartners,fkko7aq,t3_fiwye3,1584288404.0,"My ASD man is 33 and the lightbulb didn’t go off for him until last year. Suddenly, he ABSOLUTELY had it, after HE was ready to face it. Despite everyone in his life saying he is ASD for his whole life, nope, it wasn’t until he was ready to get diagnosed. and... honestly, that’s okay. He is doing super well now :)

Sounds extremely likely that your partner could have it! The quirks in his response even tell me that he probably is on the spectrum. I would just keep it in mind, but leave it for now. Let him chew on it for a bit. It is really hard to come to terms with sometimes, but he will!

My advice, for now, just continue educating yourself. Reddit is a great community/resource for ASD, IMO! If you stick with him through this, he really will probably need to lean on you, without even realizing it. And, remember to tale care of you. Being close to someone with ASD can have its own set of challenges, but it comes with so many amazing aspects as well. Feel free to message me if you need!"
TrueCrime,fketkd8,t3_fhw3it,1584120387.0,"I’ve always been deeply perplexed by these types of cases. I think it is important to keep in mind that almost always there is a lot of abuse in the child’s life, or just a lot of mental illness. Healthy people do not do things like that. I think I remember a very similar case but it was in the 60s or 70s? but it was a 10 year old girl killer, not little boys. She turned out to be just horrifically abused. I think they deserved lots of therapy, especially because they were so young and this all happened. Maybe that’s what no motive means though? They couldn’t find evidence of abuse from their upbringing? Hmmm. Unfortunately, you just can’t heal everything either & people always want revenge. (Not saying I wouldn’t react the same way. I have 2 kids and I know I wouldn’t be able to control hating anyone who even attempted to harm either of them)"

AspiePartners,fk8lpnk,t3_fgyuxp,1583958431.0,"Mine hasn’t yet, but I know he will. He has a plan. I’m pretty sure he’s already asked my father permission, because he knows that matters to my dad. I think for him it is just a matter of getting all of his ‘ducks in a row’ if you will. He wants it to be “perfect”. Tbh, I seriously won’t care what he does, I know it’ll be undeniably cute and perfect for us. And I will definitely cry and say yes and he will be like “is this good crying?” .... ok definitely smiling now, thank you. <3"

AspiePartners,fk4vaxu,t3_ffw9y1,1583868291.0,"Some of the miscommunication can be really frustrating and cause unnecessary arguments but honestly it can also create the most hilarious moments. Some of which have turned into huge inside jokes between the both of us!
I also really love the way that my ASD partner helps me think about the world. He is not so great at being socially aware in certain situations, but his understanding of ME and who I ACTUALLY am is kinda mind blowing. And if any of you have children with an Aspie, you already know what absolutely fantastic parents they make! Watching my man be a dad to our kids is just about the sexiest thing!!"
AspiePartners,fk4uqcs,t3_fg7re1,1583867974.0,"We have this little thing where we smack our lips at each other. Like, a little kiss smack. Muah. See you after work babe, muah. Thanks for dinner, muah. Or simply just a lone ‘muah’. When we are happy, sad, stressed, it’s like our little “hey... pssst... love you.” Without having to actually make physical contact or use all the words. I honestly love it. <3 he also know that I love having my feet & head rubbed/scratched, he does so for me every evening while we watch TV. I like to think these are just a very few of the many ways he shows how much he cares for me!"
AspiePartners,fk0spi6,t3_ffrr51,1583765290.0,"I have only recently started using reddit to post but I’ve been following many subs on here through the years to help gain some insight on my aspie man. I think you’re already taking great steps to being a supportive partner/friend. One thing I have found is that it is important for you to keep taking care of yourself. You have a high chance of becoming a fairly massive part of his life, and that’s wonderful, but I think it’s imperative for you to have support outside of the relationship, a safe place to put your own emotions, preferably from someone who loves both of you. He won’t be able to help you through all of your emotions, even if he may want to. I talk to my MIL about certain struggles often, since she raised him and understands both of us quite a bit. And, have fun! Honestly, even though I am still always learning about my partner, I love so many parts of life with him. The things that make him different just make him the person I adore and I trust him more than any person I have met in my adult life. Anyways. Enough about me. Good luck to you both! <3"
MakeupAddiction,fk0pwbl,t3_ffn0go,1583763437.0,"Absolutely gorgeous. The softness of that rosy pink is so gorgeous on your skin!!

Also- been there. Makeup is such a powerful tool in those moments to remind ourselves we are in some sorta control over our lives. <3"
AspiePartners,fjxfj7k,t1_fjekpno,1583671369.0,Inertia! Wow- thank you for sharing this. I am new to ASD with my partner. We are both still learning about his cool brain everyday. He is 33 and was only just diagnosed with Aspergers. I cannot believe how much inertia resonates with me about my aspie man! I can’t wait to share with him & see if he already knows about it/has anything else to fill me in on... I feel like something big just clicked & I understand some stuff about my love even more than I thought possible! Really happy.
AspiePartners,fjvru0l,t3_ff1108,1583630420.0,"I think that expecting anyone on the spectrum to change how they feel things based on who you are is not fair to either of you. He obviously is being upfront with you. If you are okay with that, I think it sounds like a healthy thing & say why not? But, if you need those things to be in your own version of a healthy relationship, it’s best to express that now. I wouldn’t put any expectations on Aspies (especially unspoken expectations) cuz you probably won’t get anywhere. Just being honest. Not that there isn’t potential for emotional growth in someone with ASD but that is always going to be entirely up to individual & not on you winning them over.
Also- while I feel like there are definitely people with ASD that struggle with wanting this romantic part of their lives or they don’t really desire love at all, but I don’t know if that’s always the norm either? I know a loads of Aspies that want love and have a lot of love to give."
AspiePartners,fjur5rc,t3_ff0vcd,1583619380.0,"I cannot speak to anyone else with Aspergers but my Aspie man would never cheat on me, and I can say that with 100% certainty. IF (big IF) I ever caught him in some type of romantic relationship with someone else, I do expect it would be for a massive reason, but I can’t say what kinda reason that would be. I just find it really hard to imagine. But, if I really did catch him in some type of lie like that, I do believe he would first react very coldly, but I also know that... after some amount of time, he would do his version of reaching out to me. Typically he attempts to make amends by intentionally talking about my interests or making my favorite dinner, even if it’s an inappropriate gesture for the situation. (Examples: One time, after a massive fight where he ruined some of my belongings, he stormed out of the house with no word, just to get me a fave drink from the store. Another time we had a little bickering argument in the morning before work, I cried a little bit, he left and I ended up letting it go. He came home with expensive jewelry.)

Most of what I’m getting at is, this seems odd. Maybe it is just him being taken advantage of, but I don’t think she forced him to sleep with her, do you?
I just... I don’t think that you should devote any more of your time to this person. You’re obviously a thoughtful, loving partner who wants to be supportive even if it means you get hurt. But... I don’t think having Aspergers means the person with it should just continually get away with hurting people."
AspiePartners,fjp26v9,t3_fehowt,1583540037.0,"My ASD partner wasn’t diagnosed until mid2019. (Last year) We have been together for almost 2 1/2 years, but he and I were acquainted for a few years before we started dating. I was his client, and he worked around the corner from my job (at the time). I guess the way it progressed was a mix of bumping into each other a lot more & flirting on social media. we established flirtationship via Instagram, he literally slid into my DMs. Lol nothing too crazy though, he was often just chatting about what I had recently posted. He never once tried to “get in my pants” but he made it clear that his attention was all on me. I loved that. I actually always had a little crush on him, but thought he wasn’t into dating someone like me haha! and he shared with me that he felt exactly the same as I did. <3 He definitely is the one that approached me first, though. He was shy, but forward as well? Just knew what he wanted, i guess... I really really liked his way of talking, I really dug his views on things (still do), & the stuff that made us different was really evident right away but I just... really liked it. Still do.
(Edited to add) I wouldn’t suggest you put your efforts into changing your personality at all. I love my mans personality and some of my fave characteristics of his are related to his ASD. Just be you."
AspiePartners,fjiyvxn,t3_fddjo0,1583378982.0,"This made me tear up. I was kinda hoping reading through these would make me feel less alone. I’ve been with my AS man for a little over 2 years. And, while I have come to accept SOOO much of this stuff, I still have these same feelings you describe. They aren’t big emotions & if I do start feeling these ways again, it isn’t very overwhelming to me these days. I remember finally losing it a little and just breaking down. I mean, I have been with him through so much and I just had grown to resent the fact that he wouldn’t tell me he thought I was sexy or that he loved my smile or even like, being noticed in general? I remember doing that corny test on like, what is your love language? test. Words of Affirmation and Touch are really high on my list of Love. After talking him through that, really explaining what actions I NEED to feel loved, I notice him purposefully asking questions about my day or various interests he knows I have. And he does make a point to express his love or attraction to me. Because he knows it matters to me. It’s not often, but it went from literally NEVER happening, to being something he keeps up with a few times a week. I appreciate the effort.

Losing it and crying at him about how alone I felt was really necessary tho. he had NO IDEA he had been hurting me for so long. & it really made him sad. And then I get sad for not mentioning it sooner because it was time I could’ve spent not building up this resentment for him and simply the way he is. And, it also gave me the opportunity to hear what he feels- he has an extremely hard time lying. & while he explained he is very physically attracted to me, my brain is just a bit more attractive to him, and he figured I “just knew that as fact” (I’m laughing looking back on this)
I urge you to just dive into this conversation, even if it’s messy at first. If he’s into this relationship, he’s into it. <3"
abuse,fitgtej,t1_fitayf3,1582719561.0,"Not overbearing at all.  I had a friend who simply just wouldn’t accept it. He wouldn’t even argue with me, he would listen to everything I had to say, every excuse. He would let me finish, he was kind and would nod, I think he understood how much I WANTED what I was saying to be true and how part of me even convinced myself everything was ok cuz I needed it to be. But, he also wouldn’t lie to me. For instance, if we had an argument, he would listen to the whole thing and then at the end he would calmly tell me what my ex did was wrong, OR he would just tell me my options again. There was the comfort of a safe place because he wouldn’t share my info with others, but also the accountability I needed to eventually have strength to leave. He helped me by finding new places to live & eventually move. Even helped me find ways to pay rent. Really, just remember that abuse does weird things to the brain & she’s probably scared af. So, if she lashes out, try to remain calm and give her space. It’s tough but worth it."
abuse,fir37so,t3_f8v6fx,1582656469.0,You can’t make her leave the relationship but you can always call the cops. Just be there. Tell her she has options. Call the cops next time you hear it get physical. Help her find those options if she decides she’s ready. Nobody could really make me leave but having friends be ready to help me get out when I was ready to... I’m really really grateful for that.
