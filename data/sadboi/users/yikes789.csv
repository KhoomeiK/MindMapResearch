fatlogic,fpvbzlj,t3_gfm689,1588941200.0,"I also have a cat - who's in very good shape now - who started getting chubby a few months back. I was super confused, because she's young, active, I was feeding by the feeding guidelines on the bag, and if I fed any less than that, she'd cry at the door for more, so I thought she was starving. 

One morning I was looking at her and realized she was getting a bit chunky, so I did some research into the food I was giving her and the feeding guidelines. Found out that ""intact"" cats (not spayed or neutered) have a higher calorie need than fixed cats (mine is fixed), and the measurements on the bag assumed an intact cat. 

My kitty was a growing kitten at the time, and I'd just gotten her spayed a couple months before this, so the drop in her metabolism made sense. I started feeding her less very gradually, spent more time playing with/exercising her, and now she's a very fit, active cat. 

Odds are, the person who wrote that comment is overfeeding their cat by significant portions and doesn't realize it at all"
