I had micromanaged it in such detail I was sure nothing could go wrong. We were absolutely skint and hadn't used the heating yet in this apartment, high ceilings and storage heaters are a pretty expensive mix. As a treat, we put them on when we went to bed on Christmas eve - just in the living room, with the heavy wooden door closed to keep all the heat in.

We wake up early on Christmas morning, and I eagerly go to sit in my nice toasty living room and have a delicious morning cigarette. The door won't open. It's totally wedged shut. I think it's something to do with the newly introduced heat, but I don't really know. I am fairly strong and fairly hefty, but even chucking my whole weight via my shoulder against it does nothing.

I rush to wake up my partner and explain the situation. He is confident I am just being a weak woman. After a few minutes of him kicking the door and swearing, I am standing at the bedroom window desperately searching for any signs of live in our little Cumbrian town - more importantly signs of anyone smoking I could bum one from!

Our phones, computers, everything that could be used to call for help are in the living room. We don't know the neighbours and have no idea if they'd be awake at this sort of time. I'm not even sure who I would call, as all our friends and family are down in London.

Although this may not be an issue currently, I would investigate this further before deciding on a career path. If a job drug tests you before employment, ask if there are any medications that are prohibited, for example. This is a fairly open ended question which may reveal you could not work if a similar thing happened again and you required medication.

Of course it's up to you, but it may save problems later on if you don't become too involved in an industry you have to quit. I'd imagine all emergency services would drug test, though I do not know their policies on specific medications."

schizophrenia,f8b57cz,t1_f8b2pev,1574427326.0,"It's certainly better but still very flawed. We're in an area way below the average house price, in most places or if you're trying to buy solo, it just wouldn't be possible.

My main gripe is that it doesn't differentiate between the people who already have assets and those who do not. Guy could be living in a million pound house mortgage free with many ferraris and still get the same amount as me. Meanwhile I'm left in a council flat (government housing) with a bus pass.

I also think it hugely discriminates against 'mixed' disabled and non-disabled couples, as my partner is expected to pay for my living costs when we cohabit. He earns a good wage, but it leaves me so dependent on him.

If we were to split up, I wouldn't be able to save up to move out as my benefits don't even cover my living costs. If he were to move out, I couldn't afford the mortgage alone. If we sold up and split then I'd end up with too much money to claim benefits and have to use it for rent until I was back in the position I am now. Might sound horrible planning for the end of a relationship, but it's a reality for something like 50% of married people - and we're not even married.

So yeah, maybe a better system, but still very far from perfect. I've heard of many people on benefits who get a large inheritance and think they can buy a house - they can't, it's counted as 'deprivation of capital' and means they lose their benefits.

It basically says that there aren't many studies that have been done on it, and those that have been done are very flawed.  

They're currently doing their own studies into it's effectiveness, which will be completed in 2022. You can read about them here:

https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/clinical-educational-and-health-psychology/research-groups/oddessi
