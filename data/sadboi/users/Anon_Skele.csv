AmItheAsshole,fpfdw8t,t1_fpfdum8,1588568405.0,I see what you mean. It just puts me in a weird pickle.
AmItheAsshole,fpfcs0q,t1_fpfcko4,1588567515.0,"I could. But I just feel bad for the guy, but I also gotta remember he is a manipulator. That's one thing he didn't lie about..."
AmItheAsshole,fpfcoc8,t1_fpfbqje,1588567437.0,"We have other options but I know he has no where else to go right now. And he trusted me...but his girlfriend also trusted him not to cheat. But idk if it's my choice to judge bc I've done that before and felt like shit while doing it. The problem is, he doesnt feel like shit while doing it. Hes enjoying it which is what makes it worse for me. I turned myself around for my relationship (going on 3 years now) and I cant stand to see someone else do it and get pleasure out of hurting people and to not see something wrong with it"
AmItheAsshole,fpfbaaw,t1_fpfb3zo,1588566362.0,"He isn't. Hes super negative and I have Major Depressive Disorder with Bipolar 2. I cant be around the negativity like that for long. I usually hide at my computer in our gameroom or stay in my bedroom. I'm trying to make the best out of life but it's so hard when every person that is in it is so toxic. And if you aren't agreeing with him, you're basically wrong. Or he atleast makes you feel that way. Hes even admitted to being a ""mass manipulator"" and can easily get what he wants. Super narcissistic. Cringey too."

AmItheAsshole,fpfaro6,t1_fpfanun,1588565979.0,I dont know where to start. Someone else suggested a burner phone but dont have her phone number and it may look suspicious if I ask Darren for it and then she immediately gets an anonymous text saying her BF is cheating. Ya know?
AmItheAsshole,fpfao27,t1_fpfa7v4,1588565906.0,He told me his gf knew and that they were broken up at the time. So he lied. Then retracted his story. And keeps changing it as it goes. I wasn't aware who Mickey was until he was already moved in and I saw her face to face.
AmItheAsshole,fpfac0f,t1_fpfa5u5,1588565660.0,"Agreed. Someone else in the comments mentioned a burner phone or something like that. I dont have Leslie's number but I do have her Facebook (not added) but for some reason, something told me to add one of her mutual friends and keep going until she adds me as a ""suggested friend"". May take time but it may work in my favor. Idk though."
AmItheAsshole,fpfa6ho,t1_fpfa2p1,1588565551.0,I would want to know so I could take action that is neccessary to either improve the relationship or cut it off. I wouldn't want that type of negative impact on my life.

But her husband has NO IDEA who my friend is (the one she's cheating on HER husband with).

I havent seen it before, and havent seen it since, so IDK.  I thought it was a glare, but why would it violently shake like a warping motion?
