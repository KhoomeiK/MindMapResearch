If it is, they’d unlock it with a key they keep hidden. If I was in the bathroom for longer than 5 minutes, shower longer than 15, one of them would come in and see if I was “goofing around” in there. I’m still not allowed to take phone calls and it was a struggle to convince them to let me do Zoom calls when my entire school shut down and I had to come home. I could only ever try to masturbate (I was trying to figure it out) when my mom was out with my sister at tennis and my dad fell asleep watching tv. I got really good at masturbating fully clothed, underneath 2 blankets, while pretending to be asleep. It’s really rough and I’m sorry you’re going through it. Hopefully nothing ever comes of it and you can move out once you’re old enough and have all the privacy you want. 

Sadly, my current roommate won’t give me any privacy either and I can’t masturbate anywhere but my bathroom because it’s the only door my roommate can’t access if it’s locked. I hope things get better for you though! Privacy is super important and some parents just really don’t get that."

I’ve had 3 sexual partners and they’ve all treated me like garbage. They refused to touch me or kiss me because of my weight and my vaginal make-up. The guy I lost my virginity to said I wasn’t someone he’d find attractive at all, I was just easy. (He said it after of course). He wouldn’t kiss me. One guy made me, in the middle of sexual activity, put my clothes on and just suck him off because he didn’t want to touch me. So, after all of those things I decided I’m never even going to wear clothes that could make any part of my body visible. I’m definitely never going to even attempt anything with another member of the opposite sex again. Probably off myself at some point too.

So, I wouldn’t say that innies are “better” than outies. I would pay quite a lot of money to change the way my vagina looks. I’ve given up on sex or on finding a partner, and even masturbation, because of it. 

So if any of you girls with outies are insecure, just know that innies aren’t all that either."

Sometimes it’s easier to just pretend and be done then bother trying to attempt an orgasm, and the blame doesn’t fall on anyone. Some women struggle to orgasm, and honestly most men are fine not helping them orgasm anyway."
sex,fn5frvu,t3_fzm5ip,1586663701.0,"As someone who doesn’t have a visible, or existing, inner labia at all, I have had all of my partners say something negative or completely stop any sexual activity because of the way mine looks. So, not bragging because I’d probably take what you’d have anyway, just wanted to let you know having the vagina you described isn’t all that when it comes to a partner either. It’s kind of a grass is greener thing."
xxfitness,fn46m7c,t1_fn3p9ef,1586635115.0,I’ve just been doing it alongside walking everyday. It’s just really doing a number on my knees and legs.
xxfitness,fn310qp,t1_fn30qwj,1586609953.0,Thank you! I’ve been doing it 5-6 days a week (doing low impact one of those days because my body is just tired). It’s gotten to the point where like I’ll just cry because I don’t want to jump anymore lol.
sex,fn304un,t3_fxvtz7,1586609234.0,"It’s purely cosmetic unless it’s causing you problems in your life. I’m considering getting one though because I want a partner to not refuse to touch it. I think if it’s a huge thing for you or a huge priority, it’s worth it if it will make you more confident/comfortable. But it does come with a lot of risks."
sex,fn2yu99,t3_fy22cf,1586608118.0,Yep it was miserable and ruined sex for me completely.
sex,fn2ylig,t3_fy7lkj,1586607897.0,"I’ve never had a partner not make a negative comment about my vagina, and I’ve even had partners refuse to touch it because of the way it looks. So, I think it’s partner specific. Like it matters to some people and others don’t care what it looks like."
sex,fn2xpsr,t3_fyhx8d,1586607077.0,"Thankfully I’ve never been horny until recently so it’s not an issue but, yes, it definitely happens to vagina-owners as well. That paired with the shame I feel around sex anyway from growing up in a conservative home is the worst."
sex,fn2x34n,t3_fyu6k9,1586606474.0,"As someone who had a partner tell me to just “suck it up” when I told them it hurt really bad, and started crying, I’d recommend you stop unless it’s something set up by you guys and it’s meant to hurt. That’s a different story."
sex,fn2wujw,t3_fywlus,1586606248.0,"It’s strange. These few weeks have been the first time I’ve ever felt horny in my life so I’m enjoying feeling like a normal person, even if I’m not particularly doing anything about it."
