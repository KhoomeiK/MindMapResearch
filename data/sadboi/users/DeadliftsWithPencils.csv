DoesAnybodyElse,fr2b5n0,t1_fr2afrw,1589834270.0,"Thanks for your comment, yea I’m pretty hard on myself (seems to be a trend with mental health sufferers), a lot of guilt and shame comes with it because it is an invisible...scar? Wound? Whatever.

Highmarks for trauma, the whole shame, low self worth thing, even though I’m aware of this I still default to feeling this way...like I did something wrong when all the trauma I went through was 99.99% at the hands of other people and I just tried to endure, survive, and stay strong as best I could. 

Yanno I did try the generic brand of Zoloft, hard to say if it did much, could possibly need to try something else. But I understand it’s a combination of things, how I think, what beliefs I hold, becoming self reliant and not looking outside for love or to fill my needs, exercise, diet, relationships, purpose/career, financial status etc etc

All those play into it. Just need to really find my voice and stop being so afraid of what others think yanno? To be able to have boundaries and not be triggered by confrontation, and to speak up and just feel comfortable and WHOLE in my own skin, instead of constantly feeling on edge, in fight or flight, nervous, insecure, shy, unworthy, worthless, etc..."
DoesAnybodyElse,fr0jruu,t1_fr0izku,1589798148.0,"Yea I mean I got diagnosed by a psychiatrist with a few things, but I don’t really buy into their diagnosis exactlyyy, all he did was ask me a list of questions and I rate from high to low on how I feel, pretty standard procedure. I definitely have a sort of PTSD or CPTSD, but it seems it’s all kinda co morbid. Anxiety, depression, trauma, adhd, etc...I try not to get too stuck on the titles being the symptoms all kinda all very similar...

I tried therapy, did a few sessions, a lot of stuff I kinda already knew from reading (cbt techniques, relaxation techniques, etc)...maybe would of helped if I kept doing it..not sure..

I know I probably shouldn’t feel this way, and even my beliefs are being hi jacked by my past trauma and now depression...

But it does FEEL all meaningless and pointless, hard to explain, but I’m sure you relate if you went through it

I often think back when I was a kid, how new and exciting and everything felt! 

The crush you’ll see again tomorrow in school, your buddies you can’t wait to play dodgeball with, a new video game, a football game coming up

Now everything seems and more importantly (which is the issue) FEELS dull, lifeless, redundant, and grey...

Give me a break. 

We’re ruled by our egos, our need to be liked, our need for more and more sex, more status and cash, we’re vain narcissists, selfie after selfie, all claiming to be brothers and sisters, while vets rot on the streets, while mentally ill citizens are hopeless and forgotten, as we shit on our planet with companies too focused on money and people too focused on consuming, where tribe and community is DEAD, and GOD is dead, where we exist in the meaningless void that is existence and that we try to stuff and fill with anything we can to distract from our big fucking SHOW.

I spend lots of time looking at people who aren’t like me and trying to put myself in their shoes and their mindsets. I just can’t. When I look at people, humans. All I see is animals just trying to get their next fix. Everybody is playing this social hierarchy game/competition, Noone is really paying attention to how toxic our modern way of living is, life is most certainly to suffer, we are vain, attention seeking, mask wearing, social ladder climbers. I’ve opted out of the game a long time ago. I wish I could find something meaningful to do, but as Nietzsche (spelling) said, “God is dead, and we killed him”. I think I just know too much, not that I’m more intelligent than anyone, just more aware, and maybe my personality and genes are just wired to feel this way...the magic is gone? I imagine the phrase “ignorance is bliss” was very crucial to past civilizations, when people truly believed what they did mattered, when people truly were connected to one another, when your work was crucial, not just consumerist manufacturing of bullshit products polluting our planet. I think to know there is no god, no evidence at least, and to realize I’m just an animal with primal desires and wants, and to see those primal aspects rule an entire civilization, I’m just bored and over it. We are puppeteered by one pleasure after the next, one new toy to the next after were bored, and we do this with people and relationships, jobs, hobbies, just perpetually dissatisfied. The worst is dating. It’s hot and passionate. You get used to it in a year or less. Dies down. Becomes familiar. On to the next, rinse and repeat. Until you’re so old, broke, unfuckable, that you just settle in with someone you don’t hate too much so you’re not alone...welcome to humanity!"

The ability to think and question. Not only that, back then, they did not understand how anything worked. So they said the lightning gods, or sun god, or wolf god. It was a way to rationalize and make sense of things they did not know and were not aware of. It was also a way to help dampen the pain, lessen the pain, of fucking existence. Of not having control in times or great loss or pain. It does not prove god exists. And you haven’t thought this, because you are subscribed to a predetermined team, or group, that comes with a set way of thinking, therefore you are limited, you see everything through god glasses, through religion. Not objectively based off of evidence. That is very dangerous my friend. Think of people from West Boro Baptist church, who spew those evil bigoted messages of hate and racism and homophobia. So many people leave these religions scarred and in deep regret that they wasted their lives devoted to a false god made up by people just like them long ago. People weaponize religion, commit horrendous crimes and just simply ask for forgiveness, and it’s all masked behind this hypocrisy and false sense of superiority because you’re a “god fearin” man or woman. It’s an archetype. A social stereo type. It’s an off the rack identity. It makes you sleep better at night, cool, but don’t come at me all righteous and holier than thou.

I want to believe, but often times I feel myself just forcing this. I believe spirituality is a necessary component to human well being, but we killed god with science, we are the first few generations if not the first with the access to the internet and all information, with this knowledge and evidence at our fingertips, it seems, voluntarily blind to believe in a god..most definitely in the traditional sense. We’re on a mediocre planet, in a mediocre universe in a galaxy with infinite universes.

Though you are right, there is much more, and I do make these associations only because well, they are true. I understand I’ll have to put on rose colored glasses or big noise canceling headphones in order to live more happily, like they say, ignorance is bliss. But I am a VERY sensitive person. I can’t ignore the truth. I can’t distract it away. At times i can. For moments, yes. But I do not live in a gated community in the hills with a butler and perfect family, suffering is everywhere, it is also most definitely everywhere around me geographically living in a pretty abandoned rust belt part of the country. It’s just, to me, the Truth. I understand I’ll need to find a solution, or acceptance, or numb myself or distract or don’t think about it too much in order to assimilate, but, I see assimilated people, everyone faces the truth eventually. I’m not sure I want to just play make believe, id rather just, feel it. Sit with it. It’s real. It’s truth. And truth is everything."

Check out a book man, or lady, it’s called Civilized to Death, by Dr. Chris Ryan. It’ll reveal a lot of why yes if I accept it, I am still not free, I gotta participate in this money chase or be homeless, and if I want any quality of life I gotta work pretty hard for it, then spend a few exhausted hours after slaving away of actual me time.

Don’t call suicide the cowards way out. That’s ignorant and a privileged thing to say. Anyone who kills themselves does not do it on a whim or because they’re weak.

The other thing, happiness is not a fucking choice, you clearly need to do a lot more reading and living my friend. Are there times you can choose to look on the bright side and maybe if you stub your toe or get in a lil fender bender that you can choose to be calm and “happy” about it, yes.

No.

No, “dranosh”, noone is taking their world view from a cartoon. Here, let me spoon feed you.

I cited RnM in order to showcase my point that nihilism is becoming more mainstream. The cartoon has exploded and they dive deeply into existential ideas and philosophies and different sciences, hence why it is often referred to as an “adult cartoon”.

Also, it is only a “cartoon” because it is animated. People watch much more stupid moronic shit which is filmed with a camera that costs more than your house.

ALSO ALSO

People taking a world view from a cartoon, might actually be more intelligent than taking a world view from a book that has been translated multiple times, talks of magic, was written by stone age people, and cites “god” murdering children with a bear for making fun of a man baldness..

Spoiler alert

THE BIBLE.

So, where should one get their world view, at least rick and morty isn’t homophobic.
