It's ridiculous for any parent to disallow their 15 year old child from watching PG-13 content (unless they are developmentally disabled, in which case the specifics of their condition would need to be factored in on a case by case basis). By not allowing someone to watch content geared toward their age group, it can actually be harmful to their psychosocial development, particularly for teens since that's when our brains most crave stimulation between the effects of puberty and a need to fit in with our peers. While putting it in kids mode would also prevent her from watching R rated content, it comes down to whether the parents raised their kid well enough to be mature enough to view such content. These days, most teens are exposed to worse things in school and by watching the news than they'll see in any movie anyway. There comes a point when controlling what your child can and can't watch on their own time is just over sheltering and does more harm than good. So unless your sister has routinely mimicked things from tv and movies with negative consequences (not counting as a little kid, since little kids do that with everything), your parents are just being overbearing/overprotective, and ultimately you're the one who pays for the account so you have the final say over who can watch what on it as they do."
