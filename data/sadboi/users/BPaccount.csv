antinatalism,fm05tsb,t1_fm05hqb,1585645885.0,Not totally sure what you're asking. It's like spending your youth wanting to be in the military and then realizing that wars are unjust and you don't want any part in them. You still carry the pieces of your past self and it's kinda sad to let them go.
antinatalism,fm057vh,t1_fm04lli,1585645186.0,"Idk it just feels like I'm suppressing an old dream. Like I'll just be idly thinking about this idea of ""when I have a kid"", like kids on a playground do, and then tell myself ""oh wait I decided I'm not going to do that"". In my youth I'd daydream about my future kids, what I'd name them, where they'd go to school. I've since had to rewrite that, which is kinda sad to me. It's no question that breeding is out of the picture for me considering the suffering I've endured throughout my adulthood, which I inherited from my parents. It's just hard for me it's all I'm saying."
migraine,flik93e,t1_fliav3a,1585184316.0,I called a telenurse and she just told me to take a second imitrex and Tylenol.
Dreams,fkjhcwu,t1_fkjh1qt,1584245953.0,"Yeah for sure. I already know this dude is as selfish as they come. He just uses me for shit. Big mouth. Disrespectful. I was already thinking of cutting ties with him, and I think this dream was the final push."
Dreams,fkje20b,t1_fkjcih8,1584243248.0,"You're right though. I'm already pretty certain what this was all concerning, especially considering my current dry spell. I think the transparent penis is like my anxiety about my sex life vanishing, my penis being rendered unusable.

I'm kinda in a place in my life right now where all the people around me are really just focused on themselves and their own problems. So I wasn't really surprised by that part of the dream."
bipolar,fenu4j4,t1_fenqhkf,1579290748.0,You both have described my major psychotic episode word for word
bayarea,f5s9umo,t3_dor37c,1572418467.0,"I'm now 0/10 on trying to get a first date with girls since moving here 3 years ago. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but it's making me fucking sad. This used to be easier for me. Trying to keep my head up, but it's taking shots at my confidence."
whatstheword,f58ysc8,t1_f555ith,1572067623.0,Looks like multimorbidity works as well! Thanks a bunch. Can I mark this I've solved too? Solved!
whatstheword,f54oqom,t1_f54nqxx,1571988127.0,Solved!
whatstheword,f54ok27,t1_f54nqxx,1571988001.0,"Oh cool, I think this works! I'll mark it as Solved! If anyone else has any other suggestions feel free!"
whatstheword,f54nmxx,t1_f548jqq,1571987373.0,Maybe something like plurimorbid? Probably would have to make up a word.
whatstheword,f54li44,t1_f54bbe9,1571985933.0,"There's a good chance I won't make it past my late 30's from heart failure or stroke. I'm 25 now so I still got some time,  but there's a slim chance I could drop dead any day now and I'd be at peace with it. 

Interesting recommendation though, I haven't thought of that. The kind of support I need is the encouragement to keep up maintaining my body and staying within the bounds of health. No alcohol, very limited diet, limits on any strenuous activity while trying not to get out of shape. Every few months I get sick of it and need a boost. I'm interested to see how others in my situation are handling it."
whatstheword,f549zzl,t1_f548iwq,1571975352.0,"Thanks for the shot at it! I used to say things like ""unlucky"", ""fucked"", or  ""lost the genetic lottery"", but I'm not really interested in inviting pity anymore. I don't really advertise it, so the phrasing I'm looking for is just for doctors, specialists, psychiatrists, and close friends. Just to make it more concise to talk about."
whatstheword,f549f3w,t1_f548o0o,1571974855.0,"Interesting! So it used to have the independent qualifier but now it doesn't. I've heard it solely used to talk about mental disorders, like bipolar/autism comorbitity.

Besides trying to find a search term for such a support group, my goal is also to find a way of saying I deal with multiple fronts on my health, without having to list off every problem. When I go to support groups now I feel like I'm just one-upping (or one-downing) my peers, which sucks because they are suffering too and I'd rather keep my stuff self-contained."
gainit,f2ytub5,t1_f2ytcds,1570498305.0,"Thanks, I'll give it a shot. I think I got too cocky with the bent-over Y's. I'll for sure cool it next time."
gainitmeals,f2ctqdi,t1_f2cto9v,1570142563.0,I'd buy it just to know that peanut butter tastes like!
gainitmeals,f2ctjp2,t1_f21z2og,1570142473.0,"Oh wow, does it taste like peanut butter?"
bayarea,eygh0r0,t1_eyggicc,1567069416.0,"Thank you so much. I don't wanna get into too great of detail, but this comment comes at great relief as some sort of control of the situation I'm in. Thanks again."
