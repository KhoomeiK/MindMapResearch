mentalillness,fort7yf,t3_g96rm6,1588018098.0,"I understand where you're coming from. I feel guilty calling into work when I am having a mental break down ( which is every other Tuesday).  They couldn't possibly understand why I am losing it, because of everything else that they need done and I am somehow letting them down. It's important to recognize that it's not you that they are upset with it, but they don't have coverage and you are the ""body"" that they have for that job. I don't know what to tell you about sick leave, no job gives enough. There's the traditional view you go in and you work. You don't think, you just do. To be honest, it might be best to find a way to calm down the mental breakdowns or help them be fewer. Recognize it is happening. Take yourself away from the current situation and breathe. Feel the feeling that is overcoming you and let it in. Cry and make peace with it. The fact you might be trying to suppress it only makes the attack worse. I know this all sounds impossible, but at the same time in order to have a quality of life of any sort and be able to afford anything you have to have an income (even part-time). And that adds an additional stressor. I guess what I'm trying to say is there's no good answer to the problem because no one with power in these types of companies recognizes nor empathizes with those suffering from mental illness. I mean you could go further up the chain of command and fight the superiors, but they will always win their war unless they should legal bias.    
Mental illness can truly be a hopeless fight, but a fight you have to be willing to sacrifice for if you want to stay on this Earth.  Either stop working/work fewer hours and figure out what you need to ease your suffering. As it is evident your body is screaming you need help. Or you keep working and keep suffering.   


I wish you good energy for you and your girlfriend. Take a walk and look beyond what you see. You may feel better."
