 Before I knew about the 12 seasons, I was sure I couldn't be an autumn but I didn't look as stark as winters, my hair is reddish brown and while my skin is light it's not as pinkish or white as the examples given. Then I found out about the 12 seasons and I knew instantly my second characteristic is deep, just still not sure about the undertones. I'm neutral when it comes to makeup, though. 

I'm gonna check out the links you provided. Thank you so much."

bigboobproblems,fpfqzxs,t3_gd3li6,1588580349.0,"Hiya. I can relate to this too. As a teen, my mom would make me wear minimizers and tshirts that were one to two sizes larger than I needed to hide my boobs. I was made to feel, by media and society at large, that my big boobs were vulgar and I am afraid of my sexuality. The only place where there were women like me was porn, and as a teen, that's disturbing, to say the least. I couldn't find bras in my size, they didn't exist here. I felt like a freak.

This is gonna sound very trite but I felt so confident when I finally found pretty bras that fit me, with matching briefs, even if they were expensive, or plain black, I didn't care. When I bought those, the lady at the shop gifted me a calendar with pictures of big-breasted women in lovely lingerie. I put it on the wall, and that helped so much. I was no longer a freak, my breasts were nothing vulgar but natural, beautiful. There were a lot of women like me.

Some time later, I found this community and I can't but be super grateful. My overall self-esteem has improved a lot. I don't even consider my breasts to be ""that big"" anymore, and if someone is annoyed by them, it's their fucking problem, not ours.

My advice. Surround yourself with the kind of media that's gonna help you embrace your boobs as something beautiful, such as my calendar. I think there's some link in here with pictures of what real breasts look like (NSFW but you can check), browse websites where there are pictures of lingerie models in sizes like yours. Your perspective's gonna change.If your family is annoyed by your boobs, wear something a little more modest when they're around, but the rest of the time, wear whatever you like.

A sales assistant once told me to size down on a t-shirt I wanted to buy. She told me: ""girl, you have big boobs, and people are gonna notice whether you are wearing this size or that size, and you need the smaller one. "" Please don't wear baggy clothing if you don't like it, in most cases, it makes us look bigger.

Beautiful lady on the other side of the screen, you have big boobs, everyone knows and notices, so what? You're a woman, you have boobs, it's their fucking problem if they're annoyed by it,  so stop trying to hide them. Do whatever you can to embrace them and feel good, because it's your life, and you deserve to be happy and confident in your own skin."
