bipolar2,fr0edtq,t1_fr0d3ya,1589792641.0,"Sertraline is a SSRI and they are supposed to be bad for people with bipolar. In my case it had me unstable as fuck with 150mg and that's how I got started on lamictal (I didn't have the bipolar diagnosis yet, just depression). Sometimes pdocs give SSRIs just to see if it makes you unstable to confirm the bipolar diagnosis. Lithium was the last addition to my meds, it mostly eliminated my suicidal ideations, I told my pdoc at the time that I was starting to feel well but I was still thinking about suicide all the time and she told me that lithium was great for reducing suicidal ideations, she was damn right. Bear in mind that I have been stable for a while but I also take more meds than the Joker hahaha. When I got the bipolar diagnosis the first thing my pdoc did was to change sertraline for Wellbutrin and I could tell the difference in less than a week.

If you feel fine with your meds then there is no reason to change them."

Psychiatry,fjijtyd,t3_fdb9ld,1583369219.0,"Bipolar patient here, sometimes the suicidal thoughts are just ""chemically induced"" (I don't know if there is a better term for that). What happened to me is that I was getting better with the treatment I had but I was still thinking about suicide 24/7, sometimes it was not about killing myself but about suicide in general, like the word just popped in my mind randomly. My pdoc told me it was time to start lithium because it helped with suicidal thoughts. Five days later after staring lithium my suicidal thoughts were mostly gone. I don't know if that classifies as reasonable."
