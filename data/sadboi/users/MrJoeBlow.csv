Now with coronavirus making these slaughterhouse workers' jobs even more dangerous, it's even more important to empathize with them and decrease demand to make their jobs a little bit easier.

worldnews,fqojxhb,t1_fqnf1r1,1589516978.0,"It's not unhealthy; we are instinctively repulsed by blood, guts, and violence. Naturally, we humans are not predators. We aren't born with hunting instincts. At some point in time humans probably started eating meat out of absolute necessity, figured out it worked well enough for sustenance, and then never stopped. 

There's a reason why we think it's ""wrong"" to show young children the reality of what we do to animals in slaughterhouses. If I started showing kids slaughterhouse footage, people would be up in arms. If we were natural, instinctual hunters/predators, children would have no problem seeing this violent, gruesome footage. But we do have these guttural reactions of disgust to slaughter, murder, and violence. 

So yeah, all that to say it's not unhealthy for people to be ""pussies"" when it comes to how repulsed they are by reminders of violence. Some people just happen to be very good at repressing that part of them that hates to see animals being hurt, and it's much easier to pretend that what they're eating was never hurt and killed when they can't tell that what they're eating was ever alive. Remind people what they're eating used to have a face with eyes and a brain capable of thought, emotion, and connection... Yeah they don't like that very much."

You don't seem to understand what self-defense is. If someone physically assaults you by throwing food and water at you, and THEN gets all up in your face, you absolutely have the right to defend yourself. 

You do not however have the right to assault someone when they ask someone why they were talking shit. You can't trespass on your own campus, smartass. And even if she WERE trespassing, that still doesn't give the boy the right to throw food and water at her."

God I'm so fucking sick of this goatfucker talking point. If you really think guns are what is going to save us from tanks and missiles, that's fucking idiotic. The US military doesn't even need to fight back against revolt with troops on the ground if things ever got that bad.

Or did Joe Biden have a little bit to do with the part where their school debts can't be absolved through bankruptcy?

And then there's the fact that most people have had it drilled into their head since they were young kids that, ""you have to go to college in order to get a good job."" It wasn't even an option for me, my dad told me I had to go. Was he willing to pay for it? Hell no. I'm $40k in debt with a degree in the only field that I thought I'd be any good at: Film. Turns out, film degrees are worthless. But I was told that as long as I went to college, everything would turn out okay. 

We force 17-18 year old kids into making these decisions before their brain is even fully mature. We saddle them with absolutely RIDICULOUS debts when college should cost nowhere near that much. The only reason it does is because we've been told since forever that you have to have a college degree in order to be successful. So EVERYONE goes to college. Well colleges are so in demand, that they can virtually charge whatever they want with the sweet lie, ""you'll be able to find whatever job you want once you're done with us and you'll be able to pay back your astronomically high debt in no time!""

Yeah I might be bitter about it lol but if you think Joe Biden is innocent in regards to this problem, you're wrong. He didn't force anyone to take on student loan debt, he just forced people into a lifetime of debt if anything went wrong after someone decides to go to college."
