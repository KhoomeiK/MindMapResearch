And the really complicated bit about it is that many of categories being given statistics here are so vague that they can fit a lot of scenarios that most wouldn’t necessarily see as fitting those categories. A mass shooting for instance is defined as an incident in which 2 or more victims are injured by gunfire. Really vague huh? And that’s won of the clearer ones. Gun violence is a little more blurry of a term than that, some statistics include all firearms related deaths under that blanket term to skew statistics in their favor. And even though it’s not being quite true to the blanket term, they’ll include things like suicides, accidents, and cases of self defense. Now on this one I could see an argument for self defense cases being included, even if I don’t agree with it. But accidents and suicides being classed as “gun violence” I don’t think so. Then there’s, “school shootings”. What exactly qualifies a school shorting. Must the school be currently in use, must there be children on the premises, does it have to be inside the building? So you see, as they’re defined very few if any of either sides statistics are straight up lying. But both sides will choose data that fits their point of view. Have you ever heard of confirmation bias? If not you should look it up, but the TLDR is if you go looking for something you’ll probably find it even if it’s not there."

Darwin was a biologist, but he was a biologist in a time when biology consisted of more folklore and guesswork than actual educated study. He was one of the driving forces in scientific change at the time. He was one of the people who actually promoted and helped create the very study you are suggesting isn’t required to follow in his footsteps. Darwin was a biologist in a time when the field of biology wasn’t yet formed, there weren’t even degrees in biology at that point. Darwin was the exception not the rule.

She calls herself a marine biologist, she has no degrees related to marine biology in any way. She has a  graduate degree in behavioral science and a masters in theology. Tell me which of these qualifies her for any of the shit she does? She’s called herself a marine biologist often enough that many low quality articles refer to her as such, they are also wrong. Legitimate marine biologists frequently point out her poor behavior as concerned to wildlife, and in many cases suggest what she’s doing is likely to cause more harm than good.

Examples: 

Marine biologist Michael Domeier, founding director of the non-profit Marine Conservation Science Institute, critised Ramsey for appearing in viral shark interaction videos, stating ""The number 1 rule of legitimate shark diving operators is DON'T TOUCH THE SHARKS!"" ""This is not shark advocacy...it is selfish, self-promotion."" 

David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist who studies sharks, told The Washington Post: ""I can't believe that 'please don't grab the 18-foot long wild predator' is something that needs to be explicitly said out loud, but here we are.""

In short she is not a marine biologist, personally I wouldn’t even call her an environmentalist. Because to me her actions don’t suggest a legitimate care for nature, so much as a need for validation via feigning care."

And doing a few hours of research is better than giving the alphabet boys a reason to kick down your door in the middle of the night. Once you’ve got the pertinent laws down then it’s time to start modifying your weapon to your specifications. The first thing you have to ask yourself with any firearm is what is it’s main purpose. Is it for hunting, home defense, EDC, or even just something fun to bring to the range. Every purpose is likely to lead you to some different modifications. If your modifying your AR for home defense for instance, you might want file a form 1 grab a tax stamp and make it an SBR. If your modifying for hunting then you’ll likely want to leave the barrel as is, or even make it longer. And you’ll definitely want to put a good mid to long range scope on there.

And really proper beard maintenance is unique to each individual, if you’ve got problems with dry skin your definitely going to want to use conditioner and beard oil to help your face stay nice and hydrated."

He definitely was in the wrong here. This is not only wrong on several levels it’s illegal for multiple reasons."

AskReddit,fqhbhgw,t1_fqh7mbw,1589373271.0,"Really it’s a cost question. There are drives capable of storing 15+ terabytes of data. That’s weeks of hd footage. That’s without even considering data compression or archiving footage on an offsite server. It’s totally doable to have better quality security footage, but the fact is no one wants to pay for the the equipment necessary to do it."
