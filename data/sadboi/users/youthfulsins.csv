Everyone getting these will understand they will not be able to have biological children, and it is their fault if they change their minds in the future.

For people with reproductive diseases and debilitating pain from endometriosis and PCOS, they are repeatedly denied a hysterectomy, although it is the last resort for some experiencing pain or unusual menstrual cycles. Most doctors will tell you to wait until you have TWO children, you are of a certain age, and your husband needs to sign off. This is completely rediculous to tell people with a disease, whom most cannot even have biological children or the pregnancy would be very dangerous. It is a very sexist view on reproduction and is mostly based on what the vagina-haver's future partner *might* want, instead of what the patient in front of the doctor needs."
