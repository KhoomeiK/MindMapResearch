BipolarAndSober,fpr7479,t1_fp6hvss,1588844813.0,I say hang in it does get better. For me I did feel like I was getting worse but I’ve already got seven years sobriety so appreciate it might be a bit different in your case.
BipolarAndSober,fp6h8zv,t3_gbg2gv,1588352306.0,"I’m in the grips of a depressive episode myself. Covid bullshit only making it worse as I isolate and struggle to connect with others. But I know drinking won’t change anything positively, at least for me. I’ll go back to pissing the bed and being generally awful with financial unmanageability not far behind. 

Just me though. I say ride it out. Connect with a few people online or locally (not sure if you’re in a programme but maybe some fellows)? 

You can always make an agreement to drink tomorrow."

CPTSD,foj1z13,t3_g7iw00,1587805176.0,Thank you. I got through the night and was able to talk to someone for about an hour which calmed me down. I will try and take things as they come today and remain present instead of worrying about my past and the future. Cheers.
BipolarReddit,fof2bgu,t1_foaxceh,1587723457.0,"Brit here and had to go private to get my diagnosis and see both psychiatrist and my therapist. I live in London and have been on a waitlist for 1.5 years already which I was just told would be extended further in light of the pandemic. Meaning I would have topped myself if I didn’t seek private help. I’m not really in a place to do this financially but luckily as a student so have found some low(er) cost therapy however psychiatry costs a small fortune. 

I’m on 150 lamotrigine (lamictal in US), 40 mg propananol (anxiety) and elvanse (adhd not quite the same as adderall in US). My mood is mostly stable."
bipolar,fodtbj7,t3_g6j0uj,1587689735.0,"Time is a flat circle (for me, these days)."
CPTSD,fobont0,t1_foakscd,1587662000.0,I hear that. In my case there were beginnings of things in my present day memory and missing chunks of those events vs entirely new stuff. Though things I didn’t register as traumatic memories have surfaced too ie living with a schizophrenic my senior year of college who repeatedly threatened to murder me in my sleep. That was something I had entirely blanked.

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,flqlzue,t1_flqdi8k,1585399656.0,"This. I think your motivation to change your feeling was to drink sherry, you poured the rest of it out which is great and there’s no reason to keep drinking but to me sounds like a relapse. Again it’s your program and no one can tell you how yo work it but in my experience, honesty = best policy and secrets keep us sick. You may wake up in emotional pain one day in the distant future and find yourself returning to this moment where picking up a drink is justified bc you “already broke your clean time once” so that might not count either."
bipolar2,flp5wzj,t3_fq6b2u,1585352322.0,"AHHHHH!! I could have written this post. I can’t bring myself to do it bc I feel like I really have nothing to offer in depressive episodes and like I’m a whiner for saying anything. 

I really feel completely paralyzed and struggle to reach out. I just feel like a black hole and just suck people in. I also feel like they don’t want to hear from me. Everyone is stressed. Everyone feels bad. Everyone is in the same boat. Except I literally want to jump out my window. 

I fucked my foot up and my normal routine has gone out the window. Trying to cope but really struggling."

If I screengrabbed my latest texts where I just drop off the face of the earth all start with ... sorry bit of a downer didn’t want to drag you in...etc. Bc I really just don’t. I think ppl don’t get how terrible this can be when you hit a low. I’m really upset and when friendships go sideways for reasons I don’t understand it just makes everything feel hopeless. 

Damn."
bipolar,flajwk6,t1_fla84eb,1584985339.0,"Exactly. It’s like please just listen. Please don’t give me suggestions. Sometimes I just need to be heard. Trust me, any solution you suggest, I’ve tried already. My moods are my worst nightmare. I really don’t know how I’m going to get through this. Part of my recovery was therapy 2x and actively trying to get out of isolation by going to gym and forcing myself to see friends. Now I’m stuck home all day (just like everyone else) only it’s the worst possible thing for me. I feel like all I do is stare at a screen all day and therapy on it is FUCKING me off maybe I need more sessions to adjust."
bipolar,flajja2,t1_fla4szp,1584985136.0,"Mate. Yes. I’ve been dealing with a really lame rejection (left on read) tried to explain to a friend via text and just got a gif back and GROW THE FUCK UP which you know, was very constructive and made me feel even better!"
bipolar,flajdvj,t3_fnhp0g,1584985052.0,"Yeah man. That shit is a boldfaced lie. I’m so weak. I can’t ask for help. I’m literally shrinking into my couch. I finally emailed my pdoc bc the meds I’m on are not doing it and I can’t see how I’m supposed to survive like this for the next few weeks/months. 

I am exhausted from doing nothing today. What strength? I haven’t eaten. Not because I’m not hungry or have no food. I just cannot be asked. Self cafe is the first to go. But yeah, fuck whoever said it makes you strong. 

I know so many ppl say they are grateful to be bipolar and if that’s you, kudos and respect. While I am glad I know what the fuck is wrong with me now, I wish someone would take it away. It hurts. Everything hurts and worse I can’t tell anyone. I have no family. And my friends have their own shit going on. I was able to talk online to a colleague from my couch where I have not moved for a few minutes which was nice. But I could in no way get into the reality of my life right now or how close I’m teetering to the edge. 

Sorry, rant over."
DysfunctionalFamily,fl9zs5y,t3_fnk221,1584973417.0,Nope. Pulling you in and hoping you’ll tell your husband
bipolar2,fl9zoob,t1_fl9yodt,1584973354.0,It’s all just too much. I’m really FUCKING depressed and highly irritable already. Older colleagues who can’t mute their mics with the news and other shit blaring in the background is just about all I can handle.
bipolar2,fl9xev5,t3_fnc7xh,1584971774.0,Not well. I’m getting short with colleagues just had a massive row over video conference but trying to just take it hour by hour and stay off the news/social media.
CPTSD,fl8dsua,t1_fl89g5e,1584921401.0,Thanks. Just feels awful and can’t believe how in retrospect it has impacted my weekend.
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fl7yqjm,t1_fl7uc7d,1584912236.0,I don’t get it either ... you can choose a name which can be 100% random someone used Bill w earlier and also opt not to show video. So it’s literally as anonymous as you want it to be.

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fl7jev2,t1_fl7bhe9,1584902970.0,Yes but you can see it recording and hosts can hit a setting which prevents them from being recorded so not really an issue. Unless people record them on their personal device but not sure what is to be gained by that.

CPTSD,fl7j4vh,t3_fn2eru,1584902806.0,"Yeah I just think like all things with someone who is anxiously-avoidant I’m just about to torch the friendship to protect myself which is unfortunate because I really liked them but at this point what fucking choice do I have? 

Thanks for connecting. Good to know I’m not alone on this one. Definitely one of the things I struggle most with (so this isolation is right up my street)."

BipolarReddit,fkx2tmy,t3_fkyigy,1584616668.0,"Congrats on such an accomplishment and thank you. 

You give me hope I can actually finish law school and become a lawyer! I only recently got my diagnosis and have been struggling with some of the things you’ve mentioned while adjusting to meds."
mentalhealth,fkti7cs,t3_fkcxjy,1584520961.0,Me. My therapist was surprised at my reaction in contrast with other patients. I suppose I’m so anxious about other shit that this seems pointless worrying about. I’ll get it or I won’t. I’m young enough without a compromised immune system so would likely survive in any event. Easier to let others feel anxiety over it.
BipolarReddit,fkthqj8,t3_fkjk0t,1584520349.0,"It checks out to me...from *severe* traumatic experiences in childhood, to moving to uni where in retrospect, I had my first major depressive episode and suicide attempt following a hypomanic phase likely brought on by all the binge drinking and drugs I had started doing non-stop. This continued for years, not understanding the signs and symptoms and how I used drugs/alcohol to manage my moods. I got sober. Things somewhat leveled out but massive depressive episodes I took at face value. Fast forward to my most recent depressive episode, sought help at my GP, was put on Prozac and dosage increased ... we all know the rest. Mixed state —> diagnosed BP2 a few months back. 

I recently learned my grandfather hung himself before he turned 50. So assuming he had something going on but no one has provided any more details. Hell I’m 36 and JUST found out."
mentalhealthmemes,fkthfhg,t1_fksqj9o,1584519945.0,Wouldn’t social media mitigate this?? Feel like most kids are on their phones even when together so what changes? Just on your phones remotely. Maybe I’m wrong though.

BipolarAndSober,fkq7ssq,t3_fjxbjs,1584434215.0,"Yeah there are no rules but it sounds like you struggle with addiction so that’s all you need worry about. There are people here from many different groups and recovery models. It might be worth trying a few and seeing where you fit in. 

Personally I relate as over the years I’ve struggled with multiple things — food, sugar, exercise but alcohol is my primary addiction. I have found in managing that a day at a time I can keep the other shit at bay, for the most part. I started smoking in Jan during my mixed episode but I figured it was better than drinking or jumping of a bridge which I was seriously considering at the time. 

When I’m ready I’ll quit again. Good luck and find your support system. We’re here for you!"
bipolar2,fkp3iiu,t1_fko50gu,1584400969.0,Wow this is me. Which sucks as I’m in my final year of law school. Fortunately the coronavirus pandemic means the rest of the year is being delivered online which is a bit of a blessing I can take my time with the material.
attachment_theory,fko7vwd,t1_fknuita,1584381834.0,"Yeah man, I say go for it... I’m like your friend in this situation so I can only tell you what I’d want to had (PS I’m a guy so not speaking from a female perspective either). 

Something like look I’m calling, no pressure, but I just want to put my cards on the table because I have feelings for you and I want us to give this a shot. Hear me out, listen to what I have to say and if you don’t want it or want to remain friends that’s totally fine but I am emotionally connected to you and think it could be more if you’re keen as well. 

(Say some of the stuff you said above, MINUS any accusatory statements. Keep everything phrased in I...because anything you put on her may trigger a defense mechanism and have the opposite effect you’re looking for).

Then give her time. Say look, take a few days to think you don’t have to answer right now. And know, that if you do say no, you won’t lose me, I’ll be here for you as a friend no matter what and will respect your choice. 

Something like that?"
bipolar2,fknixcu,t1_fkne1rk,1584366879.0,"It really is unfair, I feel. Scary to know before my diagnosis I didn’t even understand how low my lows were because Lamictal did give me a temporary reprieve but two weeks at 100mg and I know it’s too low a dose for me."
alcoholicsanonymous,fkn7f69,t3_fjh751,1584356728.0,"I’m prescribed propranolol which is a beta blocker because at 7 years sober I can’t afford to piss about with Xanax or klonopin. I find it does ease the physical symptoms of preventing panic attacks but the mental elements are still present unfortunately. 

My suicidal ideation is less connected to my anxiety but other mental health issues. Just hanging on to the phrase this too shall pass. Even though I know it doesn’t feel like it and feels like a kick in the balls every time I say it to myself. Hope you get some relief."
bipolar2,fkn1yha,t3_fjb21i,1584349732.0,Thank you for this. I’m so depressed I’m actually suicidal which scares me because what the FUCKING fuck if this medication doesn’t help what sort of chance do I have?? Anyway thanks for sharing because I feel the exact same. I’ve just stopped responding to people who ask how it’s going bc after hearing a hand of people express they were pleased to see me getting better I just can’t face expressing how I’m truly doing right now.
attachment_theory,fkmypuy,t3_fjgdw3,1584345517.0,"I’m an avoidant and can relate to your girl’s behaviour. I don’t really flirt with others but my fear of rejection sends me into protection mode. There’s a woman I really like and have a crush on who happens to be a friend. I’m too nervous to do anything because I’d hate to ruin the friendship and have all but withdrawn from the friendship. It’s a way of making the feelings go away because honestly the more time you spend with that person the more those feelings grow. 

In my case, I’ve also talked myself out of her ever feeling the same for me which is perhaps making it more difficult. 

Here’s my ideal situation as I think for myself. I’d appreciate if my signs of affection or interest were validated by the other person being direct in response. Essentially, I want the other person to lead and let me know where things stand. I want them to tell me if we try and date, and it doesn’t work we can just be friends, no pressure. I want them to tell me they understand my attachment issues going into it and are willing to work with me, understand my need for space without getting upset, but wanting to communicate with me. 

I’m rambling now but I’d say if you’re very confused. Chat with her. It may be difficult for her in person, so see if you can chat on the phone (email and text seem a bit too removed IMO, but voices can convey emotion and feeling and closeness without nearness). I know whenever i meet my crush in person, I freak the fuck out and nearly have a panic attack. Just my thoughts hope it helps!"

attachment_theory,fk8jri9,t3_fh1glv,1583957371.0,"I can say as someone who is anxious-avoidant (yay! Worst of both worlds) the lady sounds a lot like me. I just shut down once something seems to be getting more official. I have noticed it’s easier when I initiate or dictate the pace of the relationship. Otherwise I get stuck thinking the woman I’m interested in or seeing will bolt without warning so I jump the gun often. But I think honest conversations are great which sounds like you’ve done. 

Can’t speak for all avoidants but for me, whenever I sense the other person is annoyed with me or confronting me with what may or may not be an ultimatum I shut down as well. I don’t deal well with it. Luckily I’m in therapy and working on it all but very tricky. If you think it’s a relationship worth fighting for, ask her what she needs from you to feel more secure whether that’s space or whatever. It sounds like she likes you but maybe needs help finding the way forward. 

Always helpful to have someone lay cards out and let her choose what’s the best way to navigate. But she may just not be there yet and could possibly just run further away. I know I’ve done this and my ex is now happily engaged to someone else and I immediately had that flashback to the car moment you’ve described above where I left and didn’t look back because I wasn’t ready to work or even understand myself. She should definitely read attached."

BipolarAndSober,fk28bih,t3_ffy74y,1583795305.0,"Hello I can relate friend. I had a similar experience with Prozac. Hang in there. My mixed episode took about 2.5-3 weeks to finally settle down. I’m just up to 100mg of lamictal, waiting to see if I need more. 

What helped was reaching out to a good friend who knew what was going on with me, checking in and trying to steer clear of triggering situations (very hard in big city for me anyway). Watched a lot of tv and smoked a lot of cigarettes. Other than that, was mindful to avoid self destructive behaviour and again...reach out whenever I got to that place mentally. 

During my mixed state all I could think to do was jump off a bridge or get drunk bc the anguish was getting to be too much to take. I didn’t know I had BP2 at the time so getting diagnosed def helped. 

Hang in there and wait for the ride to pass. No way out but through someone said to me recently. Hope it helps!"

BipolarReddit,fj9gps1,t3_fc7s5m,1583147702.0,"Yes, this is me to a T. I find it much easier to be social when I’m not depressed. Perhaps the saddest part is that I’m saving them the experience of hanging out with me when I’m in a state of being utterly hopeless and not caring. I’ve found the people who know me best don’t take it personally but there are others who think they know what depression is because they find they’re able to carry on as normal. My personal view is those people are sad and not clinically depressed so can’t compare to what I’m going through but I’ve found I’m less annoyed or hurt by those people because they were surface level friends at best. I tend to keep my circle of friends small for this reason. Too difficult to constant have to explain what my BP2 lows really mean and how they affect me socially or feel the need to justify myself."
bipolar2,fj7et2j,t3_fbwhh5,1583090653.0,"I have not really experienced any negative side effects (the biggest concern was the rash).

Now you mention it, I did get a bit drowsy in the early days but that is 100 percent gone now! 

I’ll be heading into commercial law. A bit controversial I know (depending on who you ask) but I love technology and public policy issues so is right up my alley (doesn’t hurt that they also pay for my training)."
bipolar2,fj6w3se,t3_fbwhh5,1583081422.0,"I’m finishing a law degree (have two others as well) and in a similar boat. Didn’t get my diagnosis until after being but on SSRI. I’ve only been on Lamictal for about 5 weeks but so far I don’t believe it’s impacting my mental functioning. The first few weeks were rough as I was in a mixed state but things seem to finally be stabilising now that I’m at 100mg (essentially the lowest starting dosage after titration). Will reassess in 6 weeks to see if I need to go higher. 

I would say don’t worry about that for now. Your life certainly isn’t over. Everything I’ve read on here has been very reassuring once you get your meds right. So far my life hasn’t exploded and no one has abandoned me."

So I recently interviewed and got the job but the schedule was listed as “flexible”. When they asked if I had any more questions, I just asked a general non-descript question about how others organised their schedules. They said they were happy to work around and had WFH scheme so it wound up being a non-issue. This was not the case at my last job and I’d stress about having to leave to go to therapy and then be stressed at therapy which wasn’t conducive to my recovery. 

Good luck with the hunt! When in doubt, go with your gut re: timing. There’s no wrong way, but my biggest worry is that if I told them for some reason I’d be discounted.

BipolarReddit,fj1i832,t1_fj1h2rm,1582920611.0,Also for what if’s worth I was at a crisis point so felt I couldn’t wait 18 months to see NHS. At A&E the psychiatrist who saw me but wouldn’t section me advised me to go private given my situation. It’s been about a month and money well spent all things considered.
BipolarReddit,fj1hy6g,t1_fj1h2rm,1582920440.0,"Ongoing treatment with a psychiatrist is not as frequent once you get your meds sorted at which point, the NHS might be able to pick up your maintenance. You need follow ups about every 6 months. 

I got my diagnosis privately and that was shared with my GP so it’s reflected in my NHS file now meaning whenever I FINALLY get to see them I won’t have to go through being diagnosed again but rather just under their care moving forward. 

As I understand it going private depends on location. I’m in London so it wasn’t cheap...£400 for initial consultation but less for 30 min sessions (170) or skype (75) to reassess dosage. I’m also a student so he cuts me a break but not by much.  Google psychiatrists in your area most if not all list prices online!"
bipolar2,fj1haka,t1_fj1get5,1582920048.0,I’m only a few days on 100 but I think 6 weeks will give me more insight. Right now I can say it has def taken me out of a mixed state and the lows aren’t as bad or as long but like you not sure if this is what stabile feels like!
ptsd,fj1go9j,t3_faxity,1582919679.0,"When I got to high school and was no longer isolated from the way other families lived. I got involved in sports and clubs to get myself out of the house, made friends and was able to go to their houses. 

Was heartbreaking and very disconcerting to learn that other families loved each other and expressed emotions other than rage and anger. Even divorced families (which for a long time was the justification I used to tell myself the dysfunction was okay) were respectful and loving with one another."
BipolarReddit,fj1fqck,t3_fays1m,1582919123.0,"I’m in the U.K. as well. Not the same circumstances as you in terms of diagnosis but I was put on an 18-month wait list for psychotherapy and psychiatric services. Had to go private but the benefit is all my GP is required to do is follow his guidance. 

If you can afford it, I recommend this in terms of ease of mind and so you’re put on the right medication."
bipolar2,fj0rviq,t1_fj0rke7,1582906473.0,"Yeah it has helped me get out of the mixed state. I had a very slow titration as I’m sure you did too. I still feel quite low but not as severe and long which this is supposed to remedy. I actually have been able to socialise a bit more which is nice as I was largely shut in with the exception of work/class. 

I will be on 100mg for six more weeks at which point we will reassess probably 150mg unless I feel like 200mg is really necessary as people recommend not going too high too fast."
bipolar2,fj0qlmc,t1_fj0f4bh,1582905729.0,"Hello! Yes masters of law. And just got to 100mg of Lamictal myself and don’t think it has affected my learning or memory per se, but in my mixed state I did struggle with irritability and concentration problems. 

No I’m not able to get up during exams either BUT I went to my school disability office and as bipolar counts as a mental disability, I have provisions including...an extra hour on exams and the ability to take them in a 
separate room as groups of people can trigger/distract me so definitely worth speaking to a similar office at your uni."
bipolar2,fj07o11,t3_fam5x7,1582892215.0,Not *quite* the same but I go to AA / ACA meetings in my city which are anonymous. At times I’ve come across people who see me out living my life and vice versa and I believe the rule is you just don’t talk to people outside unless you’ve both elected to do so. I’ve personally never had my anonymity broken so I say go especially if you think they can help in the short term.
bipolar2,fj07c48,t3_farb9s,1582891881.0,"Same AND I’m in the final year of my LLM degree. 

I no longer have the energy to read for fun really and I used to get through about one a week but hope that will change. Now, for school, I have to break my reading down into 20-25 min intervals and then do something else in between. Could be an assignment or some writing or smoke cigs before retuning to the book. Seems to help me manage and not get overwhelmed. 

I too have ADHD and anxiety but my psychiatrist is weary of adjusting any other meds until we get my Lamictal dosage right. 

Hope that helps!"
BipolarReddit,fiyo1ma,t1_fiy07ta,1582843220.0,"Hard same. My dosage on Prozac got upped at week two when I was still complaining the medication was fucking me up until I wound up in A&E truly suicidal. Fortunately saw p-doc and he made diagnosis got me on meds. I saw him on Monday for the first time since 3 weeks ago and he said it was like night and day. I spent two hours with him when he diagnosed me a few weeks back but couldn’t even tell you what the fuck I said. That’s how bad the mixed state was for me. 

Godspeed!"
BipolarAndSober,fiynnk5,t3_f9qwqm,1582842994.0,"Good for you and congrats on your sober time + stability! 

Shit happens, we all blank out but luckily there are tons of resources and fellows about to help as well. Hashtag progress not perfection amirite?"
bipolar2,fiyne7c,t3_fad5jz,1582842848.0,Prozac literally drove me insane.
BipolarAndSober,fiyn5tm,t3_fa6jr8,1582842716.0,"Hello and welcome. I can relate. I quit smoking for two years a year into sobriety. Picked up for a year (working in politics!!!) then quit again for three years...until my mixed state. I just bought a bag of roll up tobacco in January and have been smoking again ever since. At the time, they saved my sobriety as I reasoned smoking cigarettes was better than getting drunk (and as I have done in the past) and most people identify when I share at meetings that I’m annoyed I’m smoking again. 

My sponsor and others tell me not to worry about it - ‘put down what’s killing you in the order it’s killing you’ is the phrase that comes to mind. In my case, struggling without knowing I was dealing with undiagnosed BP2. So until my meds and mood stabilise, the cigarettes are a welcome device to enable me to get space or take a minute for myself when things are getting too much. 

I still run 3-4 miles every other day so am feeling a bit like I can give myself some slack. But i WILL quit again...at some point in the future just not today and probably not tomorrow, which is okay. I just try not to beat myself up about it. Hope that helps!"
Dissociation,fiy8hap,t3_fagsp0,1582834595.0,"It happens a lot to me. I’ll get really turned on, start getting intimate and then CHECK THE FUCK OUT. Have recently decided in therapy to take it easy and chill out bc there’s someone I really like and it’d be great if I didn’t weird her out just yet."
BipolarReddit,fiuz5io,t3_f9womr,1582750885.0,Thanks for this post! Sober awhile but newly diagnosed with BP2 after a wild ride on antidepressants that nearly wrecked my life. In revisiting my past with my psychiatrist it was very illuminating to see how I used drugs and alcohol to help manage my undiagnosed BP2! Really lucky I didn’t pick up because in the middle of the mixed state I thought it might be my only way out.

transgenderUK,firx5lj,t1_firtwm6,1582672868.0,Nim Christopher is highly regarded. Not sure of others!
BipolarAndSober,fiptgrb,t3_f47ij7,1582620526.0,I would kill to have a sponsor with bipolar. Feel like they’d be more understanding especially WHEN I’m hypomanic.
BipolarAndSober,fiptfy9,t3_f49342,1582620493.0,"Sorry to hear you’re struggling but hang in there. I suppose the only upside to the chronic pain is the knowledge that doing drugs might only make things worse. I’ve only been sober for 7+ years and recently have been battling the urge to drink which disappeared years ago. Struggling with GI issues and dreadful symptoms which despite spending a fortune to resolve, doctors seem utterly clueless. The only thing that keeps me from blacking out to ease the physical and emotional pain is the awareness of how self destructive I become when drinking. I have no chance. So I hold on. Hopefully something gets sorted soon but until then I just stay connected to others in recovery and try not to isolate."
raisedbynarcissists,fikb5fc,t3_f89iop,1582476910.0,Mental health parents are the worst IMO and I speak from experience 🙃
BipolarReddit,fidgm5p,t3_f7oe7e,1582366758.0,Me too! I just did laundry for the first time in weeks. Don’t give a shit if my neighbors were bothered by the noise either.
mentalhealthmemes,fiats9k,t3_f738i9,1582308238.0,I treat both but with XR elvanse doesn’t seem to affect me but I’m not on full dose of Lamictal yet.
CPTSD,fi56bxh,t1_fi3t4q9,1582155911.0,We’re essentially the same. I started talking to a girl but immediately started pulling away because I’m afraid of anything beyond casual. The reality of our connection scares me! But at least through therapy and awareness I can work on it. For years I had no comprehension of why I acted as I did beyond the generic “I’m bad at relationships” something I’ve told many an ex.
CPTSD,fi3s53w,t1_fi3axde,1582126493.0,"/u/m_eye_nd ... I’ve been trying to work on this but the result tends to be the other extreme ie ISOLATION. But yes, I feel both deeply and quickly and it frightens the shit out of me so I then withdraw from whoever it is.  Feel you on falling in love = death. I literally end relationships circa 6-month period and wonder why. I go to weddings and think OH, I want THAT look at all these people and how happy and joyful everyone looks. Then I quietly recall my family environment and reckon I’d be better off alone both due to the emotional baggage I carry and the thought of being with someone else who will either consume me or leave me. This whole attachment thing is really fucked if you ask me!"
