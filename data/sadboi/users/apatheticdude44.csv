I‚Äôve been on Cipralex, and though it helped me initially get over a bad bout of anxiety, it didn‚Äôt do much for my depression, ocd, and it killed my sex drive. I feel like you quite often. Like, this is my life, and I just have to ‚Äúdeal with it‚Äù, which was not an option. I didn‚Äôt wanna ‚Äúcope‚Äù with life, I wanted to experience it and enjoy it. I went to my doctor and she gave me a prescription for wellbutrin to add onto my cipralex. 150mg didn‚Äôt do much, so I started on a higher dose. Now it‚Äôs only been about a week on the higher dosage, and I definitely notice a difference. Last night was the first time I was ‚Äúexcited‚Äù for today. I went walking in the woods, and I felt like I enjoyed it more than usual. I didn‚Äôt feel anxious. My appetite seems to slooooowly be coming back, and I thiiiink my libido is coming back too.

I know meds aren‚Äôt for everyone. Hell before starting, my friend had to basically force me to take it. I had some minor side effects, nothing bad.

I find when I started on the Wellbutrin 150mg, I did also notice a sort of...background optimism starting to creep in. It was super low, almost sub-perceptible, but my therapist also noticed. I'm wondering if that will get better with an increased dosage of Wellbutrin, from the 150mg im on now, to 300mg. For what's it's worth, im on Wellbutrin XL 150mg. I'm just worried about an increase in anxiety, because when I get really anxious, I can't shake it, and it devolves into a complete crisis where I need intervention. With Covid-19, I feel like I won't have those options of intervention and exterior help. 

I know exactly what you mean when you say you feel like you're 18 again. I feel like when I was younger (i'm 32 now), I used to sit in bed on a rainy day, and feel just...comfort and content listening to the rain outside. It used to fill me with comfort and joy, now it does NOTHING to me. I used to sit in the sun outside with my coffee and my book, and it used to make me happy. Now it doesn't do anything. I used to listen to an entire record and just melt into the music. Now, music isn't as special. It's just...there. I used to see a nice landscape, and be brought to tears. A few years ago, I was in New Zealand, where i've always wanted to be, and I felt just....nothing. That was even before being put on meds. I miss enjoying things. I miss the feeling of excitement. I miss the feeling of waking up early on a day off and having a coffee, and that feeling you get when you have your first sip? I don't have that anymore."

I go through ""episodes"" of anxiety, where im basically unable to function or cope, and one of the worst symptoms is the remaining appetite just goes from minimal, to NOTHING. 

In regards to the weed, im having trouble with it because I think I have OCD, and have included weed in my night time routine. I tried not smoking one night, but my anxiety skyrocketed. My therapist thinks it's best to just keep using it until the pandemic is more under control and i'll have regular access to help if I need it. 

The wellbutrin actually doesn't make me more anxious. I mean, I don't think it does. I'm on 150mg, and most days are fine for me. I found a month or 2 after starting wellbutrin, I did feel a very slight ""positivity"" in my thoughts and how I felt. Before the pandemic, the plan was upping the Wellbutrin to 300mg, and if I handle that well, i'd eventually start tapering the Escitalopram down to nothing. I have the container of the higher Wellbutrin dosage in my night stand, but im nervous about upping the dose, in case it makes things worse. Thats the worry. Maybe the increased Wellbutrin can help restart my sex drive a little, at least until this pandemic is over and I can at least go physically see my doctor. If I don't have easy access to help when im in an episode, it gets worse, as I feel trapped. 

The sexual side effects are the worst right now, because i've included masturbation into my night time routine, and I almost look at it like a comfort, a time where I can just enjoy myself and forget the world around me, feel some pleasure in a world lacking of pleasure. Probably not a healthy way to think, but whatever. Now, after I masturbate, it's just such a sad, weak orgasm, over in like 2 seconds, and I just end up feeling really empty, sad and broken afterwards."

For the first 2 weeks-ish, my anxiety went up, had some panic attacks, some gastrointestinal issues, sweating, and headaches. Honestly, you have to just push through the first few weeks and the side effects should diminish. If they don‚Äôt diminish by week 4, I‚Äôd suggest going back to the doctor and trying another one. I wish it wasn‚Äôt a matter of going through weeks of hell just to feel better, but when the meds start working and you can wake up and feel ‚Äòokay‚Äô, it‚Äôs a good feeling. Also worth noting is that even after the side effects subside, you may still get blips of anxiety and panic. I had blips for a few weeks after stabilizing, and they eventually mostly went away. 

So proud of you, stranger. I always thought that whoever goes through what we go through, and still go to work and keep living, that those people are some of the bravest people.

I also can‚Äôt remember the last time I felt excited over anything.

I‚Äôm still struggling with anxiety in the morning, but I‚Äôve been put on a new medication and I can feel the anxiety starting to lift slightly. Something I‚Äôve found which helps is just going out. In my head, going out may be scary, it may bring feelings that nothing will help, but that‚Äôs just the anxiety talking. I joined a gym, and I‚Äôve been going every day that the anxiety is bad. I don‚Äôt even work out, I just spend time taking showers and relaxing in the sauna. I end up feeling really tired at the end of it, and going home doesn‚Äôt feel as scary.

antidepressants,fa89lkc,t1_fa7z3su,1575843252.0,"It‚Äôs so hard. If I can just vent and write this down for the billionth time on reddit, I go through the same thing every day. I wake up at 6am to take my synthroid. I‚Äôll remember how terribly I feel, start getting anxious. I‚Äôll try turning on a meditation app, but for some reason, my brain associates all that stuff with more anxiety. Taking deep breaths doesn‚Äôt seem to help really. So that makes the anxiety worse. I‚Äôll switch positions, but my legs and arms just feel restless. Ill feel a warm flush in my body, cold chills, and a nauseous, nervous feeling in my stomach. I‚Äôll then think of my day. If I have nothing planned, that will make my anxiety skyrocket. So I‚Äôll take an Ativan. But then it won‚Äôt do enough. That makes me feel so trapped. If I don‚Äôt have anywhere to turn to calm me down, that makes me super panicked. Since I‚Äôm so nauseous, I can barely eat food. There are grounding techniques and stuff, but for some reason, my brain will feel anxious if I get out of bed too early. I have work tomorrow, which I‚Äôm really nervous for. I work in a big box store which is always busy, and I‚Äôm nervous I‚Äôll have a panic attack there and have to go home. Last night, I went up and slept in another room, and it calmed me down. But now that I‚Äôve had anxiety there too, I associate there and my bedroom now with anxiety, and feel unsafe there. I associate EVERYTHING with anxiety, and feel the need to avoid it. Movies, music, foods, smells, everything causes anxiety. It‚Äôs so debilitating when everything you can do to divert your attention brings anxiety itself. Ugh I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, I‚Äôm waiting for the Wellbutrin to kick in, but so many people are saying it will make me anxious, or won‚Äôt affect it. My sister told me that it will probably get rid of the depression, which will make me calmer. It‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm anxious over being trapped, and that feeling brings on panic attacks. I‚Äôm sorry this went nowhere. It just feels good to just vent."

Sure I can go ahead and take more meds, but then I‚Äôll have to possibly deal with side effects. And even if they work, I‚Äôll have to come off them, and I feel like I‚Äôll just revert to my old self. Sure I can start going to the gym, but I‚Äôm underweight, have no muscle mass to even work with, and no appetite to even start gaining weight. Plus I‚Äôm in considerable debt and I feel like I‚Äôm struggling to just stay afloat, so I can‚Äôt really afford a gym membership. Sure I can just find work outs on YouTube and do them at home, but them my depression just makes it IMPOSSIBLE to get moving. Everything has a wall between it and me. And that wall is just too high. I can‚Äôt climb it. And if I try and fail, I‚Äôll fall to my death. I‚Äôm so scared. I keep trying to better myself, and I end up in the same boat. And when I get really anxious, I feel like I‚Äôm sinking. I keep posting on here or other subreddits as a way to just make myself feel less isolated. I feel like I‚Äôm treading water, and I keep yelling for help, and nobody is listening. And treading water is becoming more and more difficult. I‚Äôm just so tired of treading water.

getting_over_it,f91b3ul,t1_f915nwa,1574985650.0,"Thanks. To answer your question, I‚Äôm not going through anything big right now. I‚Äôve literally been on autopilot, doing the same garbage I do every day. I would do other things, but either I don‚Äôt have the energy or motivation to do anything else, or my brain will find a way to turn that new thing into an anxiety, and I‚Äôll avoid it. For example, when I was a little younger, I used to watch the Lord of the Rings. It always used to calm me down. I watched it, no joke, at least 100 times. But now, when I try and go to it, or anything else familiar for comfort, it doesn‚Äôt bring me anything. It‚Äôs like the part of my brain responsible for feeling comfort and peace has been turned off. I feel so emotionally tense. It feels like a room filling with water. I know the water is all around me. It‚Äôs filling the room up. It causes me anxiety, so I‚Äôll try and look to things which have brought me peace before. But it doesn‚Äôt matter. No matter what I do, there‚Äôs still water everywhere, and it‚Äôs getting worse and worse. I feel like I need someone to just open a door and release is all. I need to cry so bad, but I‚Äôm physically unable to cry. The tension just gets worse and worse. And even when people on the outside are telling me things which I need to do to escape the quickly filling room, my depression has enveloped my entire body in concrete. Every movement feels like I‚Äôm running a marathon. And when it doesn‚Äôt, my depression has a way to just tell me that no matter what I do, nothing ever *really* gets better. I just want the water to fill up the room and drown me already."

antidepressants,f8tnftz,t1_f8tf8rz,1574807166.0,"You‚Äôre welcome! I know how hard and lonely you feel. For me, I felt like I was between a rock and a hard place. But it really wasn‚Äôt a big deal. 

It definitely let me look at situations which, in the past, I‚Äôve had unhealthy reactions to, in a healthier way. For example, I‚Äôve had problems with friendships. I always thought that no one liked me and that I wasn‚Äôt loved. But after the meds, I was able to look at that, take a step back, and realize that it was just my depression talking. Depression is really just like that little demon on your shoulder telling you how terrible of a person you are. Now, through that experience, I know when my mental health is slipping. If I start doubting even my most solid friendships, I know it‚Äôs the start of a decline. I‚Äôm currently getting that fixed and I‚Äôm crossing my fingers that the addition of Wellbutrin will help. But because of the meds I already took, taking another medication or switching entirely, isn‚Äôt as scary. I know I might feel terrible for a week or two, and that if I don‚Äôt improve, I can taper off and stop and try something else. 

Just remember that you aren‚Äôt alone in this. Once you start being open with those around you about your mental health, you realize just how many people are dealing with similar stuff. It‚Äôs incredibly calming just breaking it down and taking with people about it. Also, if you don‚Äôt already have a therapist, please look into it. Therapy has helped me in ways I‚Äôm which I never thought of. 

Best of luck xoxo"

antidepressants,f8tb7hg,t3_dytmzt,1574799737.0,"Hey. I was exactly in your place 2 years ago. I was so anxious and depressed that I was non-functioning. I was prescribed 10mg of Escitalopram (lexapro, or Cipralex in my case, just a diff brand name), and I was so shit scared of taking it. My mom basically sat there and forced me to take it. The first 2 weeks or so were a little brutal. I was more anxious, my palms were sooooo sweaty. But then, the anxiety started dissipating. It's been 2 years. 

The pros of this medicine? I wasn't in the fetal position with anxiety anymore. I felt..hope. For the first time in a while. I was able to think about my problems in a healthier way. I still get anxious every now and then, but it's almost like the meds have taken the edge off, and made it so I don't spiral out of control. It's easier to get out of anxious episodes. My depression was mildly touched tbh. I was taking the meds primarily for anxiety so this wasn't a deal breaker. 

The cons? This med really messes with my sex drive and performance. I rarely get horny, I have a hard time staying hard, and reaching orgasm is difficult. I'm still not sure if it's because of the meds or just depression, as the sexual side effects only started now, after 2 years. I also found at the beginning, I was getting bad headaches frequently, and sweating a bunch. Also, though it might be good for some, I find about an hour or 2 after taking my meds, I get this surge of energy. Some people might like it, but I find it's almost a nervous kind of restless energy, which I don't enjoy. 

Honestly, the med saved my mental sanity when I took it. I'm not sure how I feel about it now due to the sexual side effects, but at the time, when the shit was really hitting the fan, the last thing I cared about was sex. I just wanted to feel better. But now that my anxiety is a little better, i'll be supplementing the Cipralex with Wellbutrin XL, which i've heard can help combat the sexual side effects. Here's to hoping! 

Hope this turns out well for you, friend. I know how scary and daunting taking your first dose ever can be, but trust me when I say that it isn't the end of the world. You're on the right path, friend. Get through the initial start up side effects, and you'll hopefully see some light. Make yourself a self-care package for when you're feeling like shit. Get outside. But most importantly, talk to people. I was so scared of taking the meds, but my friend who I confided in, told me she was on it too, and that it saved her life. Talking about it really helps. Good luck, friend."

Despite what people say here, taking care of your loved ones is important. If anyone gives you grief for either, well that‚Äôs just a sign they aren‚Äôt right for you. I think the pressure of moving out as soon as you‚Äôre old enough is dumb. If your family has no issues with you living there, and you don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs all that matters. Try and remind yourself that if you live your life how YOU want it to be lived, despite circumstances, the right people will fall into your lap.
