StopSelfHarm,fnmzek0,t3_g2g9uz,1587081189.0,"i had this problem when i needed to use a blade for biology labs. it was really frustrating but i had an amazing friend who kept an eye on me while we had to use it and then i gradually got used to using the blade just for cutting plants and stuff and then the teacher made a comment that my cuts were the cleanest. and it was so bizarre that i had to laugh.

so i dont know what your situation is right now, but i recommend throwing all the blades away and if you can't do that, then make sure there is someone who can hide them and give them to you if you really need them for something non sh related and also can look after you while youre doing it.

 love you, stay safe."

also manatees are probably the most peaceful and curious creatures. I love those guys. 

also the color pink, do you know how many shades of pink there are? a lot.

also there is a conspiracy theory that says that all rocks are actually soft until you touch them.
