And now that I have an answer I can stop asking myself if she likes me.

We are still friends though, it’s weird.

I really don’t like my doctor because i feel like she doesn’t take me seriously. She is always just apathetic and really doesn’t seem like she cares if I ever bring up depression or anxiety.

The reason I take Adderall in the first place is because it’s so easy to get.

It makes me feel sick, makes it hard to eat and it gives me headaches but it’s still worth it.

I have been struggling a lot with my depression lately (just went through a breakup and she is already with someone else).
But the drug makes me forget about my depression and anxiety for the most of my day.  
And fuck me does it feel good to just not give a shit. I don’t hesitate to say what I actually mean to people and the fact that it makes you extroverted is almost worth it on it’s own.

The fact that I don’t have to pay for it probably means I’m going to get addicted but I don’t care any more.

I always go by the stupid mindset if i just wait until this thing happens in my life I will be happy. I just keep doing my same old routines and think “next month I will be happy”

It’s gotten to the point that even in my dreams I don’t even dream of things happening. I dream of preparing for things happening. Like: being on an airport looking for my terminal, preparing for a party, going to meet someone.
But I never dream of something actually happening, there’s never any payoff.

I feel like I’m just on a train going absolutely nowhere. 
“ If i just wait some more the train will arrive” I tell myself.

Right now I’m trying to get out of that mindset. I’m meeting new people and just having fun.

I realized that the train isn’t an obstacle, the train is a metaphor for life.

The train doesn’t stop until you die but that’s not a bad thing. The train is your life and it’s never to late to start enjoying the ride.

I haven’t looked at those photos since and I’m not going to.

In my experience looking backwards is just a waste of time and it only makes me sad. Instead I focus on getting what i want from the future.

I also try to seek out social interactions but definitely always overthink it.

But I still feel like an alien, there’s really only one person that fully knows who I am.

I’m always super scared of fully opening up about how I feel to people. This is also the only person who knows I’m depressed.
