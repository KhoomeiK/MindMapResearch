Surely it would go up, no further analysis and looking at stock charts and figuring -- I simply expected them to do better than retail stores, and that is probably happening big time right now.

If you have an issue where a cable in your laptop internally is disconnected/broken they will charge you several hundred dollars for a new motherboard, rather than a charge to replace and install a new cable.  For phones they will often have similar issues, or label them as unfixable once out of warranty. They aren't unfixable they just have no incentive to know how to fix them, so they often don't know how when others can. They should do component level repairs like where they replace a part that costs less than $1 with a new one because they figure out that part is broken (example a cheap resistor or fuse), but they never do that they only replace entire boards and call it a repair.
