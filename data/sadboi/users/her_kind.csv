BPD,fatcvns,t3_eaimxw,1576336941.0,"I can relate as I've recently had a similar experience. Yeah, the associated feelings are excruciating. In my better moments, I have used this as an opportunity to find the validation I had sought from this person within myself. These moments are few and far between, but if you're able to rely on the inner strength I know you have, that is tremendously rewarding work. It's hard as hell. I can't do it most of the time. I've been in similar situations before, and I do feel that putting monumental effort into shifting and re-shifting the focus to a place of acceptance and of searching for the comfort I had gotten from this person within myself has been instrumental. I think it's such a key part of recovery. I don't mean to minimize or trivialize your experience. Like I said, there are few moments I'm actually able to do this, and it takes an immense amount of work. I think people who suffer as we do also do have this strength, though, and if we can tap into it and make incremental steps to rely on it more, it is ultimately so rewarding. Just really, really hard. I hear ya."
BPD,f9swmu1,t1_f9souh4,1575602357.0,This is also similar to my history.
BPD,f9swdu5,t3_e6rx3h,1575602178.0,Yep
BPD,f9q3lw6,t3_e6dl0i,1575554548.0,Yes. This is so relatable and well put.
BPD,f9ou6sz,t3_e69wvz,1575513693.0,"YES. Absolutely. They are freaking amazing and, like someone else mentioned, are lifesavers."
BPD,f9f5mok,t1_f9eqorc,1575260199.0,What is your blog? I have one as well.
BPD,f9f2ows,t3_e4sj6l,1575257978.0,"I do think itâ€™s a spectrum. Also, 5 out of 9 has always felt arbitrary to me. Why not 4? Why not 6? How about the severity of the symptoms that you do meet? To me, this disorder is largely about emotional dysregulation, interpersonal struggles, and the inability to cope, particularly with those interpersonal struggles. The core issue can play out in a multitude of ways. I think the diagnostic criteria have a large degree of subjectivity to them. It does irritate me when someone claims to have a disorder I donâ€™t think they have, especially if I do have those symptoms, and especially if they have been absolutely debilitating for me. However, I am in no position to judge anyone elseâ€™s subjective experience in life or struggles. Most people do not know my struggles. Very few people have seen the extent to which my mental health has stunted my life and how debilitating it has been. Iâ€™m often quick to judge, but the truth is we just donâ€™t know the first thing about other peopleâ€™s realities."
puppy101,f8x0aq6,t3_e2p3sz,1574904778.0,I'm so sorry to hear this. You're not being a downer at all. I'm glad you posted. I really hope everything turns out okay.
BPD,f8v3tzt,t3_e2ew3a,1574858438.0,"Yep, I totally agree with you."

BPD,f8rc05l,t3_e1kqxi,1574736758.0,"Iâ€™m so sorry that happened to you. Sounds really unprofessional. Doctors donâ€™t seem to have much time to actually be considerate, for the most part. Iâ€™m rooting for ya..."
BPD,f8rbqnm,t3_e1nv4q,1574736588.0,Thatâ€™s great! Congrats!
BPD,f8ot7c9,t3_e1fzp4,1574689721.0,"Thanks for sharing your experience! My gripe with DBT is that it does nothing for the core issues. It maybe helps develop better coping mechanisms, but it doesnâ€™t do much for the core pain, so to speak. Iâ€™m glad you found something that gets more at the core stuff."
Mosaic,f8g8lxu,t3_e0q3py,1574555854.0,Looks really good!
BPD,f8g7v70,t1_f8g6sua,1574555577.0,"Yep. It does help that there are others who can relate. I often forget that, so I'm glad you posted. It certainly made me feel less alone this evening..."
BPD,f8g4e9w,t3_e0qfvi,1574553937.0,"Hey, I don't have a great solution to offer but just wanted to say I'm in a similar boat. It's rare that I connect with someone, and I've also experienced a major loss recently. I'm also awkward as hell and also just don't like most people, so I don't know if I'll ever get to experience the kind of connection I felt to this person--it's happened very rarely in the past. I'm trying to accept what's happened as best I can, but it's hard. My heart literally feels like it hurts, and struggling through this alone is very challenging. I try to connect to people in peripheral ways. Sometimes, a little bit of kindness from a stranger goes a long way. The world just feels so cold these days, and when I can experience a small bit of connection to someone or feel or offer kindness, it makes me feel slightly more human, slightly less alone, if only for a glimpse of time. I haven't yet found a way to form genuine connections without sabotaging them. I have to believe that it's possible. I'm living in survival mode big time right now, and I just have to believe that I can still learn and improve and get through this and experience genuine and lasting connection. I try to connect to this hope as much as possible, when I'm not, like, bawling on the bathroom floor..."

BPD,f7k19vd,t3_dwichm,1573791910.0,So true. Thanks for sharing this.

GRE,f5c9qn1,t3_dnkpsw,1572132015.0,Where does it say that sqrt(x) is always positivd on the GRE? Iâ€™ve encountered a problem in the 5lb in which this wasnâ€™t the case.
GRE,f1davqu,t3_d8x14d,1569378527.0,It wouldnâ€™t make much sense for those who came before her to esteem her work...
BPD,f13ai8e,t3_d7nlpm,1569157342.0,"Details-wise, this plays out differently for me, but I can relate. I have certain triggers that similarly lead to worst-case scenarios. Itâ€™s sometimes connected to feeling happy and this some awful thing completely destroying everything as well. My fears donâ€™t seem that far-fetched, especially when I nosedive into them, so itâ€™s hard to tell apart a realistic concern from one of these paranoid spirals. I try really hard to avoid things (like the news) which often trigger me and can cause me to go from feeling okay to completely despondent in seconds. I havenâ€™t found a better way of dealing with these things than avoidance, but I know itâ€™s not a terribly good way of dealing with things because I get triggered all the time anyway since these triggers often come from unexpected places."
Dogtraining,f0mcdxl,t3_d5k3o7,1568741777.0,Aaah... same issue right here. Mine also barks incessantly in class.
puppy101,f0a8e0m,t1_f09z37o,1568511793.0,I started out with her crated and then moved on to seat belted so that I could interact with her more. It has about the same effect. :/
puppy101,f096auj,t1_f093f6u,1568494749.0,I'll talk to my vet--thanks! Your story is also very reassuring :)
BPD,f05wi9l,t3_d3ug1e,1568421794.0,"Yes, I can relate. I often start things quite optimistically, do well, am ecstatic for some short amount of time, and then quickly spiral. It usually starts with some small triggering thing. I'm about ten years older than you and super stubborn, so working on changing behaviors and not acting on impulse has been very slow-going for me, BUT it has definitely improved. I have stability in my life today I never imagined was possible. 

Despite some consistency (which means sticking things out through the ups and downs, not quitting or moving or drastically changing things at the drop of a hat) in many areas of my life, there are still many things that I've started and quit. It's an all too familiar pattern of thinking I found something or someone that will ""save me"" only to recognize that said thing or person will not do that, which leads to great disappointment. 

I try to make a point of sticking with things if for nothing else then for consistency's sake. It works with some things but not others. I try not to make rash decisions. I try to recognize catastrophic thinking, that if something was going great yesterday, it probably didn't completely go down the drain today just because someone irritated me or made a small error. 

I don't have an answer, but I wanted to respond because I relate. It's a work in progress for me. I try to recognize catastrophic thinking patterns and not act on them (that's the biggest thing: not acting on them). When I want to make a drastic change, I try to make myself wait two weeks. If I still want to do it then (and I usually don't), then I do it. Easier said than done, of course."
puppy101,evy5d5t,t3_cl1cru,1564923003.0,Amazing! Congratulations!
BPD,euwokc6,t3_chpc8a,1564077674.0,Yes! Thank you for posting thisâ€”glad Iâ€™m not alone. I definitely have similar experiences. Physical symptoms of anxiety are the most difficult for me.
BPD,euwnvym,t3_chqmyn,1564077448.0,"Yes, that would be wonderful."
puppy101,euq13uq,t3_ch2ns2,1563968471.0,Yep! All the time!
BPD,esa9xu3,t3_c6omgv,1561754899.0,"It's not so black and white. There's a vast spectrum of symptoms and presentation for pwBPD. Just as with people with SUDs, for example, there's a difference between a person who actively ignores his/her condition and makes no attempt to get better and a person who's keenly aware yet still struggles and has really rough moments. It's one thing to take responsibility for hurting people and another to say, ""therefore all pwBPD are selfish assholes who should be shunned.""

Empathy does not have to equal letting someone who's acting out walk all over you. Empathy and boundaries are not mutually exclusive. IMO, both are necessary and helpful."
BPD,es563vl,t3_c5pujq,1561602592.0,"That's great! I actually had something similar happen the other day, but I was also tired and frustrated and didn't react as well as you did. Kudos!"
