Depression is like a disease, and like other diseases it can be cured. The state of your mind can be truly cured. But first we need to make ourselves want to get a bit better. We need to find reasons why we want to be cured. How does a normal day look like for you? Usually when we are so captured by our own dark mind that our behaviour (isolating, not doing enjoyable things) will only make us feel worse."

SuicideWatch,eore4l9,t1_eorcvyo,1558805241.0,"I feel the same way about not having the worst result, however, even though if your life looks absolutely fine from the outwards, you’ve depression. People that have “less” than you can still feel happier. You’re mentally suffering a lot and putting yourself down, because that’s what depression does. Depression becomes little by little worse and worse, but that’s also how it can be cured, with small positive steps it can become better and better. How has the past 4 years been for you? What activities did you enjoy doing? Are there things that help your mind to relax? Have you been in the nature recently? Like taking a walk, or even laying down and observing a different aspect of life. I tend to feel most depressed and alone when I’m in my room. When I’m in the nature I see so many people who are alone, they are out for a walk, or they read a book. I usually find a bench, I smoke and lay down and just try to observe the nature and get out of my own negative mind. I really think when it comes to depression we are own worst enemies and the worst feeders of our depression. Maybe you can find a way to “leave” your mind sometimes too. It shows a different perspective of life."
SuicideWatch,eorc5tp,t1_eor6atx,1558804224.0," If we didn’t care about our own lives then we would be free. I’m not saying that humanity shouldn’t have existed, and even though I think that humanity will definitely eventually destroy itself and that makes me kind of excited— I still don’t see view humanity as something necessarily bad. I think it’s nice that there’s a specie that can make use and absorb the universe, in a way humanity contributes by giving the universe more meaning. Also lots of people feel great about life. However, I don’t think the concept of living should be forced by humanity. The people who don’t want to take part of this illusion should be given the option to just EXIST. and family/friends/strangers shouldn’t be sad about this. It should be normal. When someone suffers and dies we usually say “he’s in a better place” etc,. why can’t we use this concept with voluntary deaths too. It drives me crazy"
SuicideWatch,eorb70c,t1_eora4pj,1558803789.0,"Exactly. Besides life being such a shitshow, it is such a luck/lottery driven reality. We have SO little in control and yet have to deal with all the shit life throws at us, as if we “deserve” it. I’m not sure what your situation is like but I’m sorry that you’re going through this, I do really hope that your mental health will become better though. Trying to leave the world is so fucking hard. I’ve tried hanging twice and it went horrible. It won’t be my next method."
SuicideWatch,eor9b19,t1_eor82pa,1558802986.0,I’m so sorry that you’ve go through this. Can you tell more about it? I might be able to relate and offer a bit of help about your situation. I really do think that there’s a light still waiting for you down the road. You didn’t succeed at suicide because it is not your time yet.
SuicideWatch,eor8ujp,t1_eor6xud,1558802802.0,"Finding the right professional help can be a long road, but definitely worth it. Since you are still here, you might as well give it a chance now. It seems like you are going through a lot at the moment, so why wait any longer? A good psychologist or therapy plan can make a huge difference. Depression is an disease, it will make you feel the absolute worst about yourself. The high expectations you’ve for yourself, do you also have those for others? No one has the “instructions” for life. We all get fucked or fuck up but keep going and at a certain point it will get better again. That’s the curse and beauty of life. Good things come and go. But it’s about not giving up, having a healthy mindset about it and realising your worth it (therefore self esteem plays an important role). You seem to be really hard on yourself, you’ve come really far already why not give yourself some lack? It’s okay to have flaws and to not be perfect, you can still love yourself. You’re a living breathing thing, part of a family and a memory to someone. Also be aware of all the good you have. And things will change. Your life at this moment isn’t a permanent moment."

SuicideWatch,eor1ng6,t3_bsvi5w,1558799780.0,Same. I’m sorry you’re going through this. I wish I could say something helpful. Have you tried professional help?
