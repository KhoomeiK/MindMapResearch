It impacts my relationships too, because it's hard to date when I'm not exactly happy with my life.  I was hoping that aya could help me to break out of these shackles, but alas, my ceremony was cancelled due to the virus. 

May I ask what you do now?  Did aya help you make the decision?  It's such an...interesting industry, I love that you understand.  It's more than a day job, it's a lifestyle so it feels like a lot to walk away, even though I haven't been happy in years."

But I agree, I’m more likely to respect her views because I follow her in another realm. I still don’t think that means she has zero credibility. 

And about the appeal to authority yeah that’s spot on. I actually hate when people do that, and I know I did it. I think what I like most about her is she doesn’t act as an authority. She actually tells people NOT to trust her just because she is a doctor. She says that they should trust themselves and be their own authority. 

I feel somewhat offended by you telling me to sharpen my critical thinking skills, as I posted this thread fully knowing where my biases and logical fallacies lie.

IntellectualDarkWeb,flyvl2p,t1_flyinmn,1585609989.0,"Sure. I mostly just feel like I haven’t seen much compelling evidence, based on the numbers I’ve seen for corona versus regular flu, that this will require significantly more hospitalization than a bad flu season. 

I’m not saying that “it’s the flu”. I’m saying I haven’t seen any numbers to corroborate whatever projections are being made by the mainstream media. 

I get that the death rate is higher than the flu. However we know that tons of asymptomatic people haven’t been tested, and the tests are fatally flawed and wrought with false positives. 

For additional color, I work in hospitals. I do business in hospitals across the entire Midwest. Nurses have been telling me that their hospital census is so low (too few patients) that they’re sending nurses and staff home without pay. They say that patients come in the ER in a frenzy and are being told to go home and self isolate if they test positice. I’ve been inside hospitals and haven’t seen any patients in the hallways on ventilators. So I just feel like something isn’t adding up, and I feel as though as soon as I point any of this out everybody just becomes a parrot. 

Maybe we just did this as a worst case precaution. Okay, cool, but then I have to ask - is the remedy worse than the cure?  Are we making huge decisions without truly having a grasp on the situation?  I’m not saying that i know the answer. I’m saying, can we ask ourselves that critical question before we not only shut down the economy - we already did that - but before we continue to infect our entire global population with fear of disease, fear of others, fear of death, fear fear fear fear fear. 

I’m mostly afraid that these measures will impact us socially forever, and that we truly do need connection. We need microorganisms. We need to not be bathing in purell in order for our immune systems to properly develop. 

I think we need to be asking the real deep questions about what is going on here, and decide with an open mind a) how much trust and liberties we should has done over to authorities b) how we deliberately want to recreate our social lives after this and c)how much we want to “fight” and live in fear for potentially the rest of our lives.

Ayahuasca,fkaufoz,t1_fkat9cw,1584019726.0,"I know all of this.  I have a degree in biochemistry and have studied virology. 

Despite the facts, I can still viscerally feel the societal panic and tension. That said, I spoke to a physician in Italy who was quite concerned about the state of the healthcare system and it’s ability to support the people who need respiratory aid. 

I’m not here looking for facts, they are near impossible to find and are all tainted with fear.

I’d just like to release some of the tension that comes from, I guess, information overload, prior to the ceremony."

unpopularopinion,fk6dvmc,t3_fghw4k,1583899532.0,"The woman who taught my life coach training actually gets referrals from therapists on the regular.  It’s not about what the client is “labeled”, it becomes about how they feel. If they want to feel better, and life coaching helps, why not?  Most therapy doesn’t work (and I respect therapists, just speaking the truth) so why not try some different tools?

Ps, I’m a life and career coach.  I also have a biochemistry degree and an MBA. Most coaches aren’t trying to prey on vulnerable idiots, if for no other reason that vulnerable idiots don’t make good clients. 

I don’t think you can last long as a life coach if you suck. There aren’t many totally batshit stupid people with money to blow out there."
