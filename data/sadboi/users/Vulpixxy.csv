TooAfraidToAsk,fqj620y,t3_gj84t3,1589405536.0,"It's not a dumbass question at all! It's not something you get taught about when you're growing up. If you have no one to show you, how could you know :)

One of the best things I reccomend is making an appointment with your bank to discuss finances. They can go through what you earn and what you spend to see what surplus you have towards going towards rent. Or if you're looking to buy a house they will work out what they can lend you depending on what you can afford to pay back a month. This will make it a lot easier when house hunting to see what u can afford.

Ok so getting a car. It depends on the variety you are after. If you want a new or a very decent second hand going to a dealer like Volkswagen or Ford and they can show you what they have and give u prices depending on what you can afford to put down and pay monthly. You can either do it so it is yours at the end (higher purchase) or lease the car for a few years and give it back at the end and walk away or take out another car. If you just want something to get you to and from work and is cheap maybe a local dealer if u can save up the cash to pay in one go. Then there is no debt.

I hope this help! Any other questions let me know or DM me and I'll try and help :)"

I completely get it, my main issue anxiety causes me is constantly worrying about how people perceive me, what they think what I'm saying is wrong and that everyone close to me must hate me or be dissapointed in having me as a friend or loved one. 
Sometimes I'm not too bad and can ignore it, but some days I'm a wreck. Counselling is helping.

Again, I'm so sorry you feel like this. I promise it will get easier. But if things get like today and you ever need to vent or just get whatever it is out you can always message me. There will be no judgement, just love and support."

Then on our last day of 6th form he kissed me on a hill all us kids would hang during breaks.
I was shocked. His best friend was like finally!
And weve been crazy about each other ever since :)
Been together just over 10 years and got married this July. I feel lucky every day to have met this incredible man and that he loves me as much as I love him :) it's been nice as we have both changed so much since 6th form, due to life experience and we have both helped each other grow and become who we are today, and from my side feel like I love him more and more as time goes by."
