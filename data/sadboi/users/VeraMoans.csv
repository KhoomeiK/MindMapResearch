Given my hotel on any given day houses 200+, with a popular restaurant that hosts 200+ a night, the precautions that Marriott is taking are for safety. I was laid off completely because our GM and my direct supervisor have no expected return date, and therefore we can't apply for standby unemployment. By laying many of us off we can collect standard unemployment in my state. 

I hope everyone is doing okay, stay safe, and please call your family and friends to check in on eachother. The next few months will be a time in which our humanity is tested. I hope we all become better neighbors despite the distance."

I also charge an overtime rate (x 1.5) for working beyond 40 hours a week, because I value my time. My rates in a pretty small city are seen as cheap too. $35/hr is completely reasonable.

AmItheAsshole,f933a8v,t3_e3f7tf,1575048791.0,"YTA. Essentially you just replaced your children's mother. Your son is 6 years older than A, and can understand grief better. Your daughter was a child when she lost her mom. Of course she's lashing out with this new stranger that you've invited into their mother's role. Your daughter was rude, but is still grieving, and to me it speaks volumes on your relationship with A even before her mother passed. I'm guessing that she was closer to your late wife then you. She probably confided everything to her, talked about her future dreams with her, talked about what her wedding would look like or if she'd have children ever, etc. A's favorite person in the world vanished from her life without a goodbye. Now you've brought a stranger into your home, sat her in your late wife's role, and expect A and your son to treat her the same as their mom? You are truly delusional.

I think that A was out of line for her comments, but less so than you are for including a stranger at the holidays to fill your late wife's roles. A definitely needs some grief counseling and I think you do too. A need's to reconcile with the world that she is never going to get to have all these wonderful mother daughter milestones that adulthood brings. 

And you need to go to counseling for you terror of being intimately alone and communication. You just latched on to the first person who made you laugh once you got over a couple grief stages and are trying to force that person into a role. A role that A definitely doesn't want filled and probably your son too if you would take the time to talk to your children.

As to the tuition, love is not transactional. But you are teaching her this by dangling her future in front of her on the caveat she must adore your new girlfriend as much as. If you want to punish her, take away her texting and data, so that she has to actually call and communicate with people to reach them. Or if you want A to get to know your girlfriend, punish her by making A go on a girls day with her. Nails, hair, pedicures, fishing, movies, comedy show, etc. + lunch or dinner. A and your gf are NEVER going to be mother and daughter, but they could be friends."

It's directed mostly towards latinx and middle eastern (or appearing middle eastern) immigrants or even straight up American citizens with those heritable backgrounds. Racist southerners believe that immigrants are sent by the devil himself to steal the jobs of white Christians, to rape and murder god fearing Christian women, and to dilute their bloodline. I say this as a Texoman, there are two different tones to take with that saying. For you it seems like a suggestion made by friends and aquintences out of an observation that you would be more content in the state you moved from. The second more common way it's heard is towards non-white appearing individuals to go back to their homelands  despit,e the fact they may be a 3rd generation American ,or just an American and this is their home land and where they came from.

I hope this explains it a bit more ."
