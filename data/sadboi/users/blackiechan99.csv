UpliftingNews,fq6oxlv,t1_fq6oc7v,1589135705.0,">production is trash?

every song is like tonically & sonically similar. incredibly plain to me, huge step down from his last two projects imo. same upbeat production throughout TBD. On top of that half the songs he's rapping/singing about the same things, and on the other half he's rapping about nothing of substance. There's barely any innovation going on.

>I don't find them corny.

i mean to each their own, but jeez.

>And maybe he's saying it's the best shit he's ever done because he's very proud of a project that's deeply personal to him.
