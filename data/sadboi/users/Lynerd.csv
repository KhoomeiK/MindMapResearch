'So I go back to the doctors and say they're too big. They say, ""Great. We'll take them out and make your implants smaller.""'

But they did not sit well and six months later they started slipping through the mesh. 

'Now the implants are like down to the bottom of my rib cage,' said the former pinup.

She explained that she is not even sure why she got implants in the first place.

'It must have been something inside myself when I wasn't feeling secure enough about myself and thought this will take care of the problem,' she said. 

She added: 'Before my surgery I was derailed by the boob train. I felt like I was in the wrong body, especially when you're considered a sex symbol.

'Now I'm back on track and I'm implant free and I feel like me,' she said. 'I'm so elated that I can do a back handspring on a Ferrari!' ¬ª

So don‚Äôt worry so much about every exact thought and feeling you have has to come out in this super-confident, accurately depicted life story. The therapist has seen dozens of patients with all sorts of issues, so they can adeptly read patients and will use their expertise to guide you.

I was into the yoga pants before lululemon switched to mostly leggings. Had the usual pilling where my thighs rubbed up against each other, which to me is normal and not something I‚Äôd rate a star less because it‚Äôs just life. When I started to gain weight (I‚Äôm probably 100 lbs more now than 5 years ago) the leggings stretched with me and they weren‚Äôt showing signs of sheerness and strained fabric and stitching. I stopped wearing the size 6 & 8 that I had before when I could fit snuggly into size 12 because what if I end up losing the weight and these have stretched out too much. Now the size 12s I have are more to my size and the only gripe I have is for the longer ones I have, 28‚Äù inseam, the ankles get loose. But the 25‚Äù ones are fine. I reckon if you‚Äôre more athletic than me you probably won‚Äôt deal with the same issues like the waist of some pants (like the Ready to Rulu) digging into the flabby part of the belly. I sized up in those (they‚Äôre like super lightweight jogging pants with the ankle cuff) and these ones I notice they loosen up a bit while wearing. It‚Äôs totally fine and what I like. The material isn‚Äôt the same as the leggings so I didn‚Äôt expect them to behave the same. 

I also have a few wraps, sweaters, hoodies, and tanks. The merino wool they use is soft and not itchy at all. A lot of it is appropriate for the office and I see the brand is slowly itching towards that niche as well. Every one of their garments that I own has a decent amount of stretch, even the On the Move pant. It‚Äôs currently quite useful now that I don‚Äôt go out as much and keep stuffing my face ü§£"

90DayFiance,fp1ghr5,t1_fp1f0zo,1588234725.0,"I‚Äôm in love with the brand, tbh. So my opinion is quite biased. The quality goes up and down over time, usually the reviews will reflect that. Biggest complaint I see is pilling on certain fabrics (they use a lot of terminology not used elsewhere in the clothing world, like luxtreme, nulu, everlux, etc) and frankly, I still don‚Äôt know which one‚Äôs which. 

What I can say is that I‚Äôve had other, cheaper types of leggings before and they all sucked compared to lulu. They would lose their shape and loosen throughout the day but lulu doesn‚Äôt do that. The Align are the ones I find are not as constricting as other types and they‚Äôre soft as heck. The stitching is excellent, of all the stuff I‚Äôve bought over the years I haven‚Äôt had errant threads, or holes to fix. You can also get your pants hemmed free of charge at their stores (when open) and if there‚Äôs a defect or a problem with the garment, they‚Äôll likely replace it for another. I haven‚Äôt had that happen but I‚Äôve heard of it happening to others. 

As far as prices go, they can be expensive but much like other athleisure wear, they‚Äôre middle of the pack in cost. Which is why I 95% of the time buy from We Made Too Much. It‚Äôs final sale and so far haven‚Äôt regretted any purchase even without trying on. I rely a lot on reviews and people will often state if it‚Äôs true to size or if you need to size up or down."

I‚Äôve always felt that whatever I buy online is true to size. The /r/lululemon sub is a great place to ask questions and see what others think of their stuff. Align leggings tend to be looser fitting than Fast and Free and other types. Wonder Under is, in my opinion, the second loosest but holds its shape better. I don‚Äôt do any strenuous activities (the weight gain is proof, lol) but apparently you can buy certain types for running, cycling, yoga, etc. The sub has taught me so much over the years and lately people have been obsessing over the Align tank (currently sold out on the app in Canada) and posting their hauls there.
