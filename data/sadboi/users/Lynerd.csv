'So I go back to the doctors and say they're too big. They say, ""Great. We'll take them out and make your implants smaller.""'

But they did not sit well and six months later they started slipping through the mesh. 

'Now the implants are like down to the bottom of my rib cage,' said the former pinup.

She explained that she is not even sure why she got implants in the first place.

'It must have been something inside myself when I wasn't feeling secure enough about myself and thought this will take care of the problem,' she said. 

She added: 'Before my surgery I was derailed by the boob train. I felt like I was in the wrong body, especially when you're considered a sex symbol.

'Now I'm back on track and I'm implant free and I feel like me,' she said. 'I'm so elated that I can do a back handspring on a Ferrari!' »

My own shrink told me today that his job is to listen to what his clients are too afraid to say out loud and he then reframes what he thinks I’m saying into easy observations and what I can do to overcome the anxieties I’m too afraid to say. So don’t worry so much about every exact thought and feeling you have has to come out in this super-confident, accurately depicted life story. The therapist has seen dozens of patients with all sorts of issues, so they can adeptly read patients and will use their expertise to guide you. 

Therapists aren’t there to judge you or criticize every move you make. My anxiety tells me that’s wrong but I’ve had enough first-time therapy sessions experience to know my anxiety is a piece of shit."

90DayFiance,fp3npna,t1_fp3fqht,1588282543.0,"Oh my, you’ve tried quite a few!! I had some American Apparel ones before lululemon was around my old hometown. Like you sit down and all of a sudden they got loose around the knees and ankles. Same for H&M ones. 

I was into the yoga pants before lululemon switched to mostly leggings. Had the usual pilling where my thighs rubbed up against each other, which to me is normal and not something I’d rate a star less because it’s just life. When I started to gain weight (I’m probably 100 lbs more now than 5 years ago) the leggings stretched with me and they weren’t showing signs of sheerness and strained fabric and stitching. I stopped wearing the size 6 & 8 that I had before when I could fit snuggly into size 12 because what if I end up losing the weight and these have stretched out too much. Now the size 12s I have are more to my size and the only gripe I have is for the longer ones I have, 28” inseam, the ankles get loose. But the 25” ones are fine. I reckon if you’re more athletic than me you probably won’t deal with the same issues like the waist of some pants (like the Ready to Rulu) digging into the flabby part of the belly. I sized up in those (they’re like super lightweight jogging pants with the ankle cuff) and these ones I notice they loosen up a bit while wearing. It’s totally fine and what I like. The material isn’t the same as the leggings so I didn’t expect them to behave the same. 

I also have a few wraps, sweaters, hoodies, and tanks. The merino wool they use is soft and not itchy at all. A lot of it is appropriate for the office and I see the brand is slowly itching towards that niche as well. Every one of their garments that I own has a decent amount of stretch, even the On the Move pant. It’s currently quite useful now that I don’t go out as much and keep stuffing my face 🤣"

90DayFiance,fp1ghr5,t1_fp1f0zo,1588234725.0,"I’m in love with the brand, tbh. So my opinion is quite biased. The quality goes up and down over time, usually the reviews will reflect that. Biggest complaint I see is pilling on certain fabrics (they use a lot of terminology not used elsewhere in the clothing world, like luxtreme, nulu, everlux, etc) and frankly, I still don’t know which one’s which. 

What I can say is that I’ve had other, cheaper types of leggings before and they all sucked compared to lulu. They would lose their shape and loosen throughout the day but lulu doesn’t do that. The Align are the ones I find are not as constricting as other types and they’re soft as heck. The stitching is excellent, of all the stuff I’ve bought over the years I haven’t had errant threads, or holes to fix. You can also get your pants hemmed free of charge at their stores (when open) and if there’s a defect or a problem with the garment, they’ll likely replace it for another. I haven’t had that happen but I’ve heard of it happening to others. 

As far as prices go, they can be expensive but much like other athleisure wear, they’re middle of the pack in cost. Which is why I 95% of the time buy from We Made Too Much. It’s final sale and so far haven’t regretted any purchase even without trying on. I rely a lot on reviews and people will often state if it’s true to size or if you need to size up or down."

There’s one for men’s, accessories, and girls’ as well. 

It’s lululemon’s version of final sale. Since the physical stores are closed, the online WMTM (we made too much) is the easiest way to get that new lulu fix.

I’ve always felt that whatever I buy online is true to size. The /r/lululemon sub is a great place to ask questions and see what others think of their stuff. Align leggings tend to be looser fitting than Fast and Free and other types. Wonder Under is, in my opinion, the second loosest but holds its shape better. I don’t do any strenuous activities (the weight gain is proof, lol) but apparently you can buy certain types for running, cycling, yoga, etc. The sub has taught me so much over the years and lately people have been obsessing over the Align tank (currently sold out on the app in Canada) and posting their hauls there.
