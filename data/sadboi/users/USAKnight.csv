relationship_advice,fk6iipy,t3_fgljfe,1583903163.0,"Short answer:

Tell her to shape up or ship out.

Long answer:

Have a serious conversation with her about helping to take care of the house, contribute to rent, etc. Start with small things and work up to being an equal partner in the home. If necessary, remind her that she's not your daughter and you don't have to act like her dad. Consider ending the relationship and seeking a different, more emotionally mature gf if all else fails."

dating_advice,fjze2zm,t3_ffcgpd,1583717565.0,"I (24M) like to smoke cigars and drink straight whiskey. Some people think that makes me ""cool"" and ""classy"". Some think I'm an idiot and a hardass.

I'm a bit disappointed by the 2nd viewpoint, but people are allowed to have their opinions about me based on my vices.

I don't think you're shallow at all."
dating_advice,fj8r38v,t3_fbwiea,1583120053.0,"Forget trying to ""cure"" her. You won't. Until her problems affect her well-being negatively, the best thing you can do as her partner is offer moral support. Try asking if there's any problems in her life that you can help her with."
dating_advice,fj1tyzi,t3_fb0mng,1582927715.0,Sorry to hear that. Don't dwell too much on it. I have confidence that everyone will find someone who accepts them for who they are.
relationship_advice,fiu2xax,t3_f9sfbs,1582734233.0,"Despite what she's saying, she is insecure. I think she's either refusing to admit that she has a problem with your friend, she doesn't trust you, or both."

I hope this helps. Good luck."
dating_advice,fgi1n5b,t3_eyloiy,1580801456.0,I (23M) would be very flattered and impressed if a woman approached me first. It's tiring being expected to make the first move.
SuicideWatch,fgi0x9q,t3_eyjkyc,1580800594.0,I completely emphasize with your financial struggles. I'm sort of in the same boat myself.
dating_advice,fg99jhz,t3_exj31w,1580635995.0,I don't think there's an easy fix for this. I guess the solution is to keep trying.

Being a single, 23-year-old virgin gets me down a lot. It helps somewhat that I'm in college and in a fraternity, but the self-confidence issues are still there.

socialskills,ezfvduu,t3_d0so41,1567884888.0,"You're not alone. I used to be the same way. I'm gonna offer you advice anyway:

With what free time you have, get involved in your community and/or find a hobby, if you don't already have one. You'll have your own world to be involved in, so the other people on social media won't matter eventually. You'll probably find new connections through community work and/or your hobby too."

Other than that, I think this is great advice. Thanks for sharing."
