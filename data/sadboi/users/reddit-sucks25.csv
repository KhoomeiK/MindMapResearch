Tinder,ers2ss4,t1_ers0bli,1561196688.0,She already has his name in profile. She proceeds to call him cute. Then she says she can’t date him because he has the same name as her dad which is the dumbest excuse I heard.  Pretty stupid but w/e

socialanxiety,errp8mv,t3_c3ibpi,1561177973.0,I have the same problem and I’m a dude. Like the first date I think “we have plenty to talk about” but then afterword I worry that we will have nothing to talk about and I hate awkward silences. It’s hard to accept that it’s ok when there’s a pause in the conversation but I’m always uncomfortable when it happens.

Anxiety,erls2r5,t3_c2nh5g,1560995360.0,"Anxiety comes in different intensity levels so an anxiety sufferer isn’t always going to be in the same high level of anxiety you experience when you have a panic attack. Of course that’s not to say when you have your anxiety it’s not a burden, but it has its levels."

funny,erb2y0d,t3_c14pwk,1560659804.0,Personally I wouldn’t care. Look up YouTube videos of how people drive in Cairo before you lose your shit over nothing. I’m sure everyone’s broken some rule while driving and love to be judgmental . People can be great people and just “bad” drivers.
AskReddit,erb28fw,t3_c0y0o7,1560659043.0,Personally I wouldn’t care. Look up how people drive in Cairo before you get judgemental. I’m sure everyone’s done something “wrong” while driving and people act like they haven’t and judge others.
