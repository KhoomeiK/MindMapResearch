How about this: LIFE is dark and depressing.  You use a filter to hide that, but occasionally stuff unexpectedly gets through and you have to deal with it so you can go back into denial.  

> First of all, just because a lot of people have babies unplanned doesn’t mean that nature and chemistry don’t take over them and the baby becomes their world!

No, it doesn't mean that, but I disagree that it DOES mean that either.  Either thing can happen, and in both cases, the child should probably know that his/her parents had fuck-all for a plan for its life. 

Here's the thing -- people are constantly lying to kids (and adults/each other) and pretending there's some sort of logic/plan to life, and that it all makes sense.  They do this for one simple reason:  They want other people to act predictably. Because if we all admitted that nobody knows what the fuck is going to happen, and nobody has a plan, we're all going to start acting pretty fucking unpredictably. 

>Like why do you believe this fallacy that love for a baby only exists when it’s planned and can’t be spontaneous?

This is just a complete miss-statement.  You're going back to your filter ""Oh man dude, you see the world as so dark"".  What I am saying is that LOVE is an unplanned, often counterproductive and oppressive thing.  What we call ""love"" is a bunch of selfish fears of loss, fears of change and dependence on stability and predictabilty.  Basically, people hold onto each other like life preservers and keep chanting ""you're wonderful, you're amazing, you complete me ... also don't look down and pay no attention to the fact that we have no plan, no idea what we're doing and we're all going to die meaningless anonymous deaths soon"".

>  Also, if no one wanted to “rub genitals” together than we would have no human race.
Yes ... and because you keep pretending the human race isn't a horrifying, terrifying experience of floating over a void while pretending there is meaning and hope, you think that this is good.  And so you all keep rubbing genitals together and forcing more people to experience this tragedy. 

> So just because a lot of people abuse this natural reward which is how we are motivated to procreate, doesn’t mean it should be looked down on.

OK ... again, my argument has nothing to do with any particular person being to blame for or causing anything.  I'm saying everyone is denying what's really going on, that's all.  And whenever someone wakes up and says ""hey, anyone else notice that nobody really has a plan and everyone is lying?""  They get shouted down ""man you're depressing and dark and you really need help."" 

>  Btw most people want to have sex because they are in love... maybe you know a lot who do it for pleasure alone, but you need to get out more.

What does that mean?""  ""Most people want to have sex because they are in love.""  Seriously what the hell does that mean?  Most people want to have sex because their brains are chemically programmed to want sex.  Period. ""Love"" is a word we use to pretend that there's a logic to it because the horror of realizing how random, hopeless and incoherent life really is .... well that's a lot to bear."

It is about controlling the male mind's sex drive and channeling it in ways that people or society find useful, so they can control the person. Society wants men to be desperately dependent on real women for sex.  Any ability to simply pop in a video tape/download an image/take a doll out of a closet means that the male stops playing a key role in the cycle of life.   The sex drive is what forces men into this cycle.

I've been a porn and sex addict for a lot of my adult life, and frankly non of it hurt me nearly as much as real relationships enslaved and trapped me. As my life has gone on, I've recognized that a huge amount of the energy that other people I know put into things like dating, marriage, love etc, is just a raw animal desire that the human mind is struggling to cope with.  I watch men around me mindlessly spend huge amounts of money pursuing women, ""accidentally"" having kids with those women and then pouring crazy amounts of time and energy into keeping these new lives happy.  It's all social engineering, and they're basically just pawns.

Porn (along with prostitution to a lesser degree) allows men to deal with their internal sex drives in a (at least somewhat) satisfying way without submitting to a social system of forces that eventually almost always enslaves them as ""husbands/boyfriends"" and ""fathers"" and forces them to work long hours and pay for everything."

There is no such gatekeeping function applied to females.  If a female has trouble understanding or adapting to society, society is at least as much at fault as she is.

The ""neckbeard"" term is a great example of this arbitraryness - after all what is harder for a male to control than how much facial hair he can grow?  We LOVE arbitrary selection criteria that let us find the male losers quickly and easily. 

This doesn't happen in the same way to females, because females are given inherent value by society."

First of all, the site has only 1/10 of the audience here, so clearly there's not nearly the venom out there for such behavior by women.  Second, the site never talks about the women with the same venom that young males are shown here.  

The reason of course is that a woman can't accidentally become as repulsive to all of society as a man can.  A woman might be seen as someone less intelligent, or wrong-thinking, but she will always have a deep inherent value in society's eyes.

The posture that society has against ""loser"" men is always violent, aggressive and exclusionary.  The burden is straight on the males themselves to justify their existence -- they are presumed to be unfit, creepy, and disposable unless they prove otherwise. 

If you have a son and this dynamic doesn't bother you, you may be in for a surprise.  Or, maybe, he'll just suck up his pain and isolation, swallow it down, and be a good ""winner"" for you and please you.  I'm sure you feel entitled to that, and maybe if you're lucky it'll work out."

Painting, construction, cleaning, landscaping ... all the services do. But they aren't sex, so liberals actually are all ""yay, we love those workers doing jobs for cheap!"" 

Porn's human trafficking connection is super-sensationalized because there's a big emotional response to the idea of ""sex slavery.""  Nobody wants to admit that it's just FUN to think about sex slavery, and so people think about it a lot.  A lot more than ordinary slavery, which is frankly far, far more common and harder (there are SO many slaves in this world, miserably working at non-sexual jobs, but that just isn't as exciting to think about). 

Sex slavery is mostly popular to think about because of the deep social need we have to ""save women.""  The idea of poor, vulnerable women being forced to have sex over and over is just something that is more interesting to think about than pretty much any other form of exploitation.  Of course, it almost never actually happens, because women happen to be extremely resourceful and intelligent.

In addition ""sex slavery"" is hugely impractical on most levels. Think about it -- if you are a male a ""sex slave"" is someone you have to give round-the-clock food and shelter to to keep alive, and you're really only going to have sex with her at most a couple times a day. And really, is having sex with one woman a couple times a day going to be any better than marriage? Sex slavery actually sounds a lot more expensive and time consuming than hiring a prostitute. 

Even ""sex slaves"" who are used in prostitution are impractical.  How many men are really going to pay to fuck a true ""sex slave""?  You've got a very limited audience here.  So you generally have forms of coercion that include women being ""trapped"" by circumstances such as language or money issues. They are dependent on their ""pimps"" for money and they're afraid to leave. 

But that sort of ""slavery"" looks a lot like just plain old ""real life.""  In my past marriage I was a fucking slave -- I paid for everything my wife wanted, and she ended up stealing tens of thousands of dollars from me and kidnapping my kids for ransom too. 

So when I hear about ""sex slaves"" I roll my eyes -- they're just people in tough relationships, mostly. Nobody feels sorry at all for men in my situation, yet everyone is desperate to help the poor sex slaves.  Again, because victimized women are such a sexy thing to think about."
