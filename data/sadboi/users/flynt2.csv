Find a stick to put into the track behind your sliding glass door. It will effectively lock the door.
You don't need a bunch of ""stuff"" for a ritual, but black salt sprinkled across doorways can't hurt. You can buy it or make it out charcoal, yourself.
Personally, having lived out in the boonies for years, I believe that you are going to have to set some wards and protect your area. Look online for some low-key protective magic ideas.
