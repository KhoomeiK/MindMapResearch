childfree,foyky5u,t3_gaaocd,1588174383.0,I refuse to be considered less important and a priority to a partner than their kids from a previous relationship. I don't think it's selfish to want to be considered AS important.
Coronavirus,fov7jst,t1_fov1zfg,1588096660.0,"Sorry, I don't know why you're getting downvoted. From the persepective of someone living in Ontario, Canada (where lots of seniors move to Florida in the winter) it seems like the people in charge of Florida's public health are complete idiots. Mind you, I only hear and see what the media tells me, but to open public beaches for mass gatherings during this time, in a state with so many geriatric retirees seems mighty stupid and reckless."
Coronavirus,fov1azw,t1_fouxqn0,1588093770.0,This pandemic may have us re-evaluate transmission precautions. I first assumed this was an 'Airborne' transmitted illness since that's what SARS was considered in 2003. COVID-19 seemed to have started out as 'Airborne' and then got downgraded to mostly droplet (aerosol generating procedures being the exception). I'm just frustrated that the 'surgical masks only protect others' narrative keeps getting pushed on the public. It's not the current standard of care if you're a nurse who has to keep yourself safe when you walk into the room of a patient who has COVID-19.
gifs,fov09uq,t1_fouz4nh,1588093287.0,"Under 'Droplet Precautions' per U.S. C.D.C. standards, a surgical mask worn by a healthcare provider is intended to protect the wearer. Under 'Airborne Precautions' an N95 respirator (higher grade than a surgical mask, yes) is also intended to protect the wearer and a surgical mask theoretically won't. The current evidence is that COVID is primarily spread through droplets, although it can become 'airborne' through certain medical procedures such as intubation, nebulizers, CPAP machines, CPR, etc. That surgical masks can only protect others and aren't intended to protect the wearer is misinformation based on the current standards of care. Hope this helps."
Coronavirus,fouwk68,t3_g9nks9,1588091577.0,"Are there any other healthcare providers out there who are just frustrated with the inconsistent misinformation regarding surgical masks protecting the wearer? We're trained to don one in order to protect ourselves when treating patients on Droplet Precautions, yet public health officials and the media seem to be spreading this lie that surgical masks won't protect one from acquiring a COVID-19 infection? WTF?"
gifs,fous2re,t1_foum32x,1588089463.0,"To those of us actually trained in Standard Precautions this misinformation and armchair epidemiology going around is maddening. Surgical masks protect the wearer. Nurses on COVID units aren't wearing them to protect their patients. If anyone knows nothing at all about transmissable infections, ask yourself why you see nurses wear a surgical mask when they're treating COVID cases?"
