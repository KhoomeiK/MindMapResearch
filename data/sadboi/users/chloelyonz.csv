relationship_advice,fmzs4a1,t3_fy75kt,1586528390.0,"You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. Good for you for standing your ground. He is clearly in the wrong in this situation and shouldn’t be pushing you to do something that you’re uncomfortable doing, especially if he knows that and has been told multiple times. Your tongue has taste buds, not your other holes!!"
ptsd,fmzr30a,t3_fggcfi,1586527749.0,"Yes!! I have this problem too. I’m literally 14 and I wish at LEAST men could be less obvious about it. They just don’t care and they think it’s okay! And that isn’t okay! The amount of looks I get from older men just because i’m wearing a v-neck shirt or if i’m wearing SHORTS is just obnoxious. It triggers me almost every time. It gives me such a yucky, sick feeling."
ptsd,fmzquqg,t3_fllsje,1586527604.0,"I wish more people understood the guilt that comes along with leaving. Or in sexual assaults, why you didn’t fight back or say no? I understand why people can think that it’s the victims fault, and I mean, enough people told me that I was WRONG to convince me that I was. It takes a lot for me now to say that I was assaulted by 3 men, but it’s true. Whether I believe it or not or if my boyfriend believes it or not or if my family or my friends or my old town do. I know my truth and I wish I had known in the past. I wish this was more openly spoken about. Everyone should know these things. It sucks :/"
ptsd,fmzqc4x,t3_fwqvkv,1586527267.0,"Yeah. It’s nice not to be expected of much right now and I can have time to focus on myself, even though i can get stuck in my head a lot of the time. It sounds like a shitty thing to say but this crisis almost makes me feel better about myself? Just because I don’t feel alone anymore while going through hard times. The only thing that REALLY gets to me now is all of the unknown surrounding the virus and school and quarantine etc etc. But it’s nice."
