By design they have a very nice open draw, and it's a good value.

Estate pipes can be a bargain too. If money is tight, I think you'd do well going for pipes in the 50-75$ range...but you've got to be very careful. Don't trust a seller who doesn't give a good inner chamber bowl shot.

Pipes that appear to be smoked are good, ideally you can tell the pipe has been reamed and there is no burn out, just light granular lines of grain and carbon.

Most important photo to look at in a pipe for sale on-line is the inner chamber of the bowl, free of pits and cracks...good stuff. Some sellers leave out that detail and I always pass on those. 

Sometimes the only difference between a 25$ estate pipe and 50-75$ estate pipe is a little extra elbow grease. Keep collection, you can't smoke one or two pipes and have a fresh smoke.

Cast is maintenance...but it's minimal and the more you do it the more the seasoning is built up even. 

I would suggest not using paper towels to wipe the seasoning on because little fibers get left behind and it burns...cast iron should be wiped with a lint free towel upon seasoning. Little fibers just carbonize making ash and uneven seasoning.

sonoma,fp0ye4i,t1_fp0s82j,1588219759.0,"I think Caltrans wants the job...that's why it's being proposed in the first place...This is a lucrative contract, and the ignorant stupid council thinks it's a great way to improve our corridor to Sonoma.

Constriction...yes that's always a brilliant procedure for managing traffic."
sonoma,fp0y5we,t1_fp01acd,1588219603.0,"They want to re-develop a very solid roadway system that has worked perfectly. The guise is something to do with cycling lane, or something to do with CalTrans money that needs to be used...

Technically it would be good to fix Broadway...But to completely turn it into something it shouldn't be is another story. Look at Broadway Sonoma CA...then do some reading on proposals. You will see it makes no sense.

In terms of fire suppression we have an extremely wide corridor now on that road. They want to condense it...thus making it illogical in terms of improvement.

Under the guise of putting in a new bike lane. Logan Harvey is a moron. This proposal makes it less cycle friendly by creating a denser flow of cars...

I've never had a problem cycling on Broadway...most of the impatient drivers have simple shoved off to the other lane...this option will be void under the current proposal.

We need more input and more models proposed, or more arguments how changing it might not be the right thing to do.

The Sonoma City Council hates public dialogue, they don't have the time or patience to hear much of anything. The agenda is to preserve a wine country farce.

Historic Broadyway is awesome. The council wants to feel self righteous making some bogus decisions that doesn't need to be made.

They are are gonna screw it up and people will have to accept it."
