BPD,f3qgm1x,t3_dhta93,1571074393.0,"Yes, I've been meditating for about seven months now, and I cannot emphasize enough how beneficial meditation has been for me. It took a while to realize how much meditation helps my mental health, but I find that the more I do it, the more meditation helps me. It can take months and years but the practice is very worth it. 
I've found that I feel much more ""mindful,"" in daily life, which if you're not familiar is just being with the present moment rather than caught up in the past or future which can lead to stress and anxiety. Meditation helps me to live an overall less anxious, less depressed, and more balanced lifestyle."

BPD,ezwtlxu,t3_d2tmyn,1568224747.0,"I'm really glad you've found something that's working for you! It sounds like you are very well-versed in the DBT program and this is a great introductory post for people that might not be as familiar with it. 
Remember that recovery is a process that could take years and everyone will still struggle at times, but improvement is the goal. I was in DBT for a couple months before I had to relocate and I found the group setting very beneficial, it was comforting to hear others having similar problems at times and using the skills to help themselves. I hope DBT continues to be a positive experience for you and that you're able to use the skills to facilitate your recovery journey. It sounds like things are already so much better for you and I know that your life will only continue to improve in the future."
BPD4BPD,ezwso0r,t3_d2pux5,1568224132.0,"I've been alright, I've been hanging out with people a lot since getting back to my university which helps keep my mind off the negative emotions. I've still been feeling a persistent underlying hurt and emptiness ever since I found out my girlfriend cheated on me and we split up a few weeks ago. For some reason, I also feel a really intense guilt about it, even though it wasn't my fault. 
Although the pain is always there, fortunately it has subsided enough that I can distract myself and usually still function well during the day. That's something that surprised me, because after I found out I was cheated on I really felt like I would never be able to truly recover. Mornings and late at night are still kind of hard, especially because that's when I'm alone, but hopefully therapy and meditation will continue to help."
