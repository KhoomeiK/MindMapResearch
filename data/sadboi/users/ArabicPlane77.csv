Or help me feel like something. My mother calls depression ""a new trend between teens"" so i just didn't bother talking to her. My friends just don't take it seriously. I'm simply ashamed to talk to my father about something even close to this. I need help. Yes... even if i have never in my life asked for help, yeah, i would need it eventually
