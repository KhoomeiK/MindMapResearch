spirituality,fndil92,t3_g13r8v,1586870830.0,"I think its obvious that you were testing your faith in your beliefs by telling others what your life is like. The reaction to being ridiculed publicly is not something everyone can do in a positive manner. Keep in mind that Christians are told to accept other's beliefs and love everyone, but this is not always true. Who knows what this person's motive when they made the laugh emoji? You'll probably never know. Their interpretation of it is probably different that yours.

What you showed me is that you have self doubt about being on the right path, so what I'll say is this: everyone has their own personal truth. Some get this from science, some from religion, some from nature. But we all have our own convictions and morals. Maybe a test of your faith isnt what you need, you just needed to realise that you had faith all along."

This type of telescope is called a reflector telescope and the objective lens 90 degrees to the aperture. So no it wouldn't be on the opposite end on the telescope. It has all the hallmarks of pointing a camera into the aperture of the scope. The light in the sky is probably just a star. We cant see it move at all. This video isnt good evidence.
