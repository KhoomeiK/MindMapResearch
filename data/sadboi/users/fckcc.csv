iamatotalpieceofshit,fqfp0a6,t3_giknxw,1589328920.0,Y'all posting obvious jokes/baits on here is the real cringe imo.
AmItheAsshole,fpjeqlo,t3_gdihtr,1588665807.0,"NTA.
I was a child like her - but I just took the card from my parents wallets at night and made mass purchases on websites like roblox. They also took computer privileges away from me (except for school related activities), and honestly it probably made me a better person. I went outside more and played with my real friends and I was surprisingly a lot less stressed.
I don't know if it will become the same thing with your daughter, but I definitely think you are NTA in this situation. It isn't a joke and can even be dangerous if your daughter thinks it's okay to do this."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fpeukdk,t1_fpeifoz,1588555252.0,"Yeah, and for Asian/Hispanic women too. My point was that it isn't like ""Karen"" is the only stereotype in the world and that only white people are the ones that have stereotypes used against them."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fpeez6s,t1_fpeda2w,1588546244.0,"There is a stereotype for young black women: ""hot cheeto girls"". White women aren't the only ones who have stereotypes."

college,fopon81,t1_fopitbu,1587967305.0,"I just wish colleges would normalize failing a class or two. I mean, obviously there would be some sort of punishment, but they make it out to be the absolute end of the world to fail a class sometimes.

I truly empathize with everything you've been through, and you're really strong. For you to still be here and even be in college is a really good achievement. I know it wasn't easy for you but I urge you to not give up. If anything, make sure that everything you're doing is being done for yourself. You don't need to prove yourself to anyone."
college,fophw8i,t3_g8th2k,1587961921.0,"I haven't experienced this personally myself, but a very important person to me is going through something similar. He's supposed to be a junior by fall semester, but he's failed so many classes he's far behind and his GPA is low. He was slowly getting better because he changed his major but Corona messed it up for him. He is currently struggling, because going to campus to be with people was his way of coping.

I am in NO WAY trying to undermine your feelings, especially since I would probably feel the same way if I were in your shoes. However, I genuinely think you're fine. A lot of my smart ass friends have failed many of their classes too, you're not stupid for failing a class or even getting an 880 on the SAT. Standardized testing is messed up and bs, imo. It isn't an accurate assessment of your skills.

I can't say I have a good solution, but I can 100% say what you're going through is common and normal. It's also natural to feel this way. Sorry, I'm sure this probably didn't help."

I tried sleeping pills, but they don't work because she's genuinely that loud and obnoxious. I will try earplugs if I have to."

orangeisthenewblack,fc9iyjh,t3_egpw8y,1577553349.0,"Yeah, Kukudio was really scary to me. She was delusional but at the same time... wasn't? She also didn't have good conflict resolution skills, but overall kept under the radar in the prison. I really wish we found out what she was in for. She said she never hurt anyone but her definition of such may be very skewed in her delusions. 
Even Suzanne, who obviously has her own struggles, was more than aware that they wouldn't be able to live in the woods forever and such..."
conspiracy,fc6wytr,t3_egdy3q,1577491640.0,"Y'all are really immature. Instead just of focusing on what actually occured like you should, y'all attack their identity as well. There's nothing wrong with being confused or making mistakes, but calling them a ""he/she"" among other things isn't how you properly and maturely discuss this topic. Grow up, regardless of how you feel towards their identification."
