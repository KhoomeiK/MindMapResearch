Variable difficulty, even in game, makes it possible to have the game be significantly easier, or about the same as a Souls game. 

The addition of a cute droid companion and the stormtroopers' comedic dialogue definitely give the game a lighter, less gritty feel than you get in DS. 

The pacing is much faster than at least early Souls (I haven't played DS3 yet), and it's more difficult to isolate enemies. 

There are definitely fewer boss fights, and the pacing of them will feel wildly different than a Souls game. 

There's also an added puzzle mechanic that separates it from the SoulsBorne genre. (A respectable amount of platforming as well.) 

The story has almost nothing to do with VII-IX, so you won't be missing anything there. 

The update added NG+, which should enhance replay. As for length, I haven't yet finished but I'd estimate 25-30 hours. 

I've enjoyed it so far, but ymmv. I wouldn't play it looking for a SoulsBorne game, but you'll probably appreciate some of the similarities-- limited health equipment, enemies respawn at save points, etc. If you like the Star Wars universe as a whole, that would probably be the biggest indicator."

AmItheAsshole,fokqfm0,t3_g7xmyz,1587846976.0,"YTA massively for how you treated your wife, and also for the malicious post edit. You deleted a lot of key information there."
greysanatomy,fok2q22,t1_fok23fh,1587834297.0,True. I just went pie-in-the-sky.

Kill the dogs first. 

If you play as human, expect invaders. 

Edit: Also, as a general rule-- don't kill anyone if you aren't sure they're trying to kill you. 

Enjoy!"

a) Respect? For what, exactly? The sanctity of your roof? I mean... if that's how you want to view it, that's your right, but it's pretty subjective. 

b) If they needed/wanted their own area, the guest room would still be there. 

c) Not your call to make, they're adults and they know their own relationship better than you do."

I'd take Callie, Arizona, Mark, and Lexie in exchange for Catherine, Tom, Nico, and McWidow."

Yes, you can bar anyone from accessing your property at any time for any reason, but this is an absurd reason to refuse to welcome your daughter into your home. Here's the reality: when she turns 18, she takes control of her own life and she _will_ make some choices you disagree with. That will be her prerogative. If you respond to every single one of those choices no matter how low stakes--and this is _extremely_ low stakes, as piercings are temporary and tongue piercings don't generally scar noticeably upon removal-- by using every bit of power you have to try to control her, you will lose her. Instead, learn to start making your case when you disagree with her choices but otherwise picking your battles. She's about to be an adult. Learn to start treating her like one."
AmItheAsshole,fojv4ml,t3_g7lltb,1587830026.0,"Honestly, this is not a situation where you should be asking the internet if you're being an asshole. You should ask yourself if this is the kind of person you want to be. You also need to recognize that changing your other siblings' position is not on the table-- so, do you want a wedding with all of your siblings, or none of them?"
genderqueer,fojugaf,t3_g7pcka,1587829624.0,"Absolutely, yes. I've literally said monthly that I want a hysterectomy. People thought I was joking until I came out. It really does seem BS that we're stuck with this part that we have no use for but most doctors won't remove until we've either used it or grow old enough that it's rendered useless."
