Actually..the situation is quite tricky, let me explain:

Thinking about getting her out of what she in strengthen your emotions towards her (I hope that I said that right) which does not work in your favour if you're willing to go on your way.

On the other hand, it doesn't feel right to let her on her own.

The thing that you can do is making dua'a, A LOT!

MuslimMarriage,f34bml5,t3_dfgixv,1570652225.0,"Look my brother, I know exactly what you described, this type of people are very dangerous (I'm talking about her grandmother).

Sihr ruins lives, it won't let you progress in your life, neither dunia nor akhira (you may do so by the help of Allah, but it's painful and slow, trust me), when it comes to this kind of situations, it very hard to distinguish between what people (in your case, the girl you wanna marry) are doing by their own will and what's not, what I mean by that is this: if this family is into Magic, they surely did something so the girl will stay with them, so please don't blame her if you see that she took some ""weird"" decisions.

The advice that I can give you:

* Stay close to Allah and strengthen your Imane as mush as you can.

* Find a halal way to relief the stress (e.g. Workout etc)

I'm sorry you're going through this, I don't really have an advice to give about the relationship, I think it's better if you ask someone knowledgeable you trust (e.g. imam).

Feel free to PM me if you wanna talk.

May Allah SWT help us against this fitna!"

I hated it when I go out and see everyone with their SO having fun and smiling, most of the times I avoided going out because the more I see people enjoying life the more it crushed me.

After a while I learned to accept it as is and focus on improving myself instead of focusing on the others, I started to learn how to be thankful for what I have, going to the gym, meditating, walking in nature, reading books, do a random act of kindness, then life started to get better and I realised that being 'alone' is okay but being 'lonely' sucks, it feels bad but it's part of life, you can even feel lonely when you're surrounded by friends!

Anyway, long story short, if I'm going to give you one peace of advice that I really want you to keep in mind: ""the way you think defines how you see the world, be aware of what you're saying to your self, because it shapes who you are""

* Make sure you are following a good learning path that suits you.

* Find a good teacher

* While learning, have a final project in mind in which you'll apply what you've learned.

For instance let's say you wanna be a full stack developer, you'll have to learn JavaScript/Typescript then Angular for the front-end and Java along with Spring for the backend and the database will depend on whether you'll use SQL or noSQL etc. At the end apply everything you learned in a project and put it in GitHub, so you'll have a prove when you're applying for a job, do the same with each technology you learned, slowly this knowledge will build up and after few years you'll feel the process.

I think that you have to confront him but be smart about it, he's the one who has a problem not you and he should fix that.

He should get his shit together, depending on others when you're 23 yo isn't a good sign, especially if he has the possibility to work (as you proposed but he refused to do it)

This would be a slap in his face .. there are two possible options: he'll either get it, accept the hard truth, will thank you for opening his eyes, and everything will be great, or he'll be in denial and accuses you of not loving him and all the bullshits that comes with it. Either way this will reveal which type of personality he has, so whatever the outcome, it will be beneficial for you.
