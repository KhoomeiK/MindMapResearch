ADHD,fm05cov,t3_fs8ikv,1585645340.0,"This sounds pretty familiar. I usually will sorta spiral in my head and end up writing a bunch of random shit that I wish made more sense. I’m not sure if I have ADHD anymore, I definitely did as a kid, but I’ve been noticing some major issues I’ve been having with my mind lately and can’t seem to figure it out, and I’m wondering if it’s ADHD again, or something idk. 

If you wanna try to discuss it, I’d love to, but I also find it near impossible for me to actually organize my thoughts the way I need to. 

Here’s some nonsense I wrote at like 4am the other day when I was obsessing over some shit with my friend if you wanna read lol:




“I don’t know who I am each day, month, week, year. I look back and I don’t recognize it anymore. I look back even a month and I get incredibly sad and nostalgic. I don’t like it, I don’t like everything becoming memories that make me sad. I will always want what I had in the past, when I never wanted it then. And it’s ridiculous. Why can I be uninterested in my best friend for like a fucking month, and then now I look back on it and get so sad, and hate myself for being ignorant. And at the same time I miss the way they’d be sad that I failed to give them the attention they deserve, though at the time I didn’t care. I guess that’s pretty selfish and fucked up though. And it’s ironic because, it feels to me we’ve switched positions. I feel like I NEED the attention, I want THAT back. And I want to go back and... I don’t even fucking know. And they’re probably giving me far more than i ever deserve, but I’m too much of an idiot to see it. I don’t fucking get it. Everything feels wrong. I don’t like how the way I think changes so much, and I barely even know it. I guarantee even now as I try to figure it out, there’s SO much I’m missing. I don’t like the way my priorities are in chaos constantly, and I don’t even see it either. IM EXISTING. The way we speak has changed. The way we see each other has certainly been fluid, even if we don’t want to recognize or admit it. It feels like I’ve known them for years, but at the same time they feel almost like a stranger to me? Why does it all feel much more personal now, more than it really is? What changed in me? I miss feeling important. Maybe I actually didn’t, and I probably didn’t care, but now I feel like I would have felt important even if I didn’t. And maybe nothing has changed except me, maybe I’m making myself feel unimportant? It’s like, I think i read somewhere, there’s your experiencing self, and then your remembering self. What I experienced is a different person than what I remember now. It can be the same. Painful things I look back on and miss, because I’m romanticizing or sugarcoating it or whatever through my remembering self, I’m not remembering what I ACTUALLY experienced. This sounds crazy doensntit. Who was I? Who was I every fucking last year, or month, or week, or even day? I don’t know who I am. This is so oddly complicated I feel so lost. I’m sweating. My mind is a mess. It’s getting hard to sleep without melatonin now, I get lost in an anxious tumble in my head. I want to bash my head into a wall. I want something. Something. Something. Something. SOMETHING. something will never be enough because I will always want something, just like every day has a tomorrow. You ever get a piece of food stuck in your teeth and you start becoming obsessive to get it out? You do whatever you can, make your gums bleed, whatever doesn’t matter, get it OUT right? It feels and has felt like that in my mind for I don’t know how long. It comes and goes. There’s SOEMTHING I need GONE or something. I don’t know. Maybe I’m making it up? Maybe, maybe I’m making this up and tricking myself. 
WHEN I wake up tomorrow, MY THOUGHTS WILL BE DIFFERENT because fuck consistency LMAO.”"
