ADHD,fm05cov,t3_fs8ikv,1585645340.0,"This sounds pretty familiar. I usually will sorta spiral in my head and end up writing a bunch of random shit that I wish made more sense. I‚Äôm not sure if I have ADHD anymore, I definitely did as a kid, but I‚Äôve been noticing some major issues I‚Äôve been having with my mind lately and can‚Äôt seem to figure it out, and I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs ADHD again, or something idk. 

If you wanna try to discuss it, I‚Äôd love to, but I also find it near impossible for me to actually organize my thoughts the way I need to. 

Here‚Äôs some nonsense I wrote at like 4am the other day when I was obsessing over some shit with my friend if you wanna read lol:




‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who I am each day, month, week, year. I look back and I don‚Äôt recognize it anymore. I look back even a month and I get incredibly sad and nostalgic. I don‚Äôt like it, I don‚Äôt like everything becoming memories that make me sad. I will always want what I had in the past, when I never wanted it then. And it‚Äôs ridiculous. Why can I be uninterested in my best friend for like a fucking month, and then now I look back on it and get so sad, and hate myself for being ignorant. And at the same time I miss the way they‚Äôd be sad that I failed to give them the attention they deserve, though at the time I didn‚Äôt care. I guess that‚Äôs pretty selfish and fucked up though. And it‚Äôs ironic because, it feels to me we‚Äôve switched positions. I feel like I NEED the attention, I want THAT back. And I want to go back and... I don‚Äôt even fucking know. And they‚Äôre probably giving me far more than i ever deserve, but I‚Äôm too much of an idiot to see it. I don‚Äôt fucking get it. Everything feels wrong. I don‚Äôt like how the way I think changes so much, and I barely even know it. I guarantee even now as I try to figure it out, there‚Äôs SO much I‚Äôm missing. I don‚Äôt like the way my priorities are in chaos constantly, and I don‚Äôt even see it either. IM EXISTING. The way we speak has changed. The way we see each other has certainly been fluid, even if we don‚Äôt want to recognize or admit it. It feels like I‚Äôve known them for years, but at the same time they feel almost like a stranger to me? Why does it all feel much more personal now, more than it really is? What changed in me? I miss feeling important. Maybe I actually didn‚Äôt, and I probably didn‚Äôt care, but now I feel like I would have felt important even if I didn‚Äôt. And maybe nothing has changed except me, maybe I‚Äôm making myself feel unimportant? It‚Äôs like, I think i read somewhere, there‚Äôs your experiencing self, and then your remembering self. What I experienced is a different person than what I remember now. It can be the same. Painful things I look back on and miss, because I‚Äôm romanticizing or sugarcoating it or whatever through my remembering self, I‚Äôm not remembering what I ACTUALLY experienced. This sounds crazy doensntit. Who was I? Who was I every fucking last year, or month, or week, or even day? I don‚Äôt know who I am. This is so oddly complicated I feel so lost. I‚Äôm sweating. My mind is a mess. It‚Äôs getting hard to sleep without melatonin now, I get lost in an anxious tumble in my head. I want to bash my head into a wall. I want something. Something. Something. Something. SOMETHING. something will never be enough because I will always want something, just like every day has a tomorrow. You ever get a piece of food stuck in your teeth and you start becoming obsessive to get it out? You do whatever you can, make your gums bleed, whatever doesn‚Äôt matter, get it OUT right? It feels and has felt like that in my mind for I don‚Äôt know how long. It comes and goes. There‚Äôs SOEMTHING I need GONE or something. I don‚Äôt know. Maybe I‚Äôm making it up? Maybe, maybe I‚Äôm making this up and tricking myself. 
WHEN I wake up tomorrow, MY THOUGHTS WILL BE DIFFERENT because fuck consistency LMAO.‚Äù"
