Not everyone reacts to being assaulted the same way so there is no ""should"" and no ""appropriate"" behavior a victim is required to do. Not handling the situation in the way you THINK you would have or you it it SHOULD have been handled doesn't make her attention seeking. 

She is sharing an experience and showing others it does happen and that it's not all in our heads. Even if she does nothing else she is spreading awareness and may help another victim come forward."

therapy,fml02tf,t3_fvwsl4,1586174804.0,"Honestly, it sounds like you are still depressed, you're just a different level of depressed. 

That being said, it's not odd that you're feeling this way. Many people with depression feel this at times. Especially those who have struggled with depression for extended periods of time and from a young age. You get a bit addicted to it, partly because you have no idea who you are as a person when not depressed because it's been so long or you never got a chance to really be anything else.

Therapy helps, if you can afford it. I wish I could say it gets better forever, but that hasn't been my experience. It does get better for longer stretches of time though. And it doesn't always go as deep.

Once you start to create a not depressed version of yourself it gets easier more often.

If Aiden doesn't have money that's one thing but her talent isn't showing through in my opinion and she is getting things over looked that other queens are getting ready for.

Again I do not hate or otherwise dislike Aiden, I just want more from her. Change stuff up a bit more like Rock did with her make up right after Crystal got clocked for her signature look. Aiden does not seem to be growing be in the competition. I want her to, I like her but she's stagnating, her make is the same, her wig is the same, her behavior is the same.

She is falling on her excuses where ChiChi in a similar boat was selling it and her talent shined.

I'm disappointed in Aiden because I see promise in her but I don't really see her trying all that much. For example gluing some cotton balls to a corset and then having a nap. That, should have been a challenge where she tried harder to impress if she's going to prove she's got what it takes because you're on more even ground to show your talents and creativity without money being an issue."

ptsd,fl9e609,t3_fn6ll4,1584951589.0,"I can relate to this do much. In the laste 2.5 years I have switched therapists three times. Twice because my therapist suddenly got a new job and most recently because of billing and because my original therapist came back.

I was lucky the first switch because I had already built some trust with the therapist I switched to but for various reasons I was unable to fully open up and we mostly felt like friends that chatted once a week.

My second switch was more unexpected and I almost trusted her until she mistook my ability to cope with my triggers as me being able to stop coming to therapy all together. With her I opened up out of anger, defiance, and the need to show her I wasn't at a stopping point, I was finally at a point to do real work on the root causes of my trauma. 

And then...my original therapist came back and due to billing and my personal request I went back to her.

Sometimes trust is hard. My whole life has taught me I can't trust people, I'm sure you have had that too in your life. What I can say is that it can't be rushed. With some people it will just click if you let yourself be open to it but it won't always be quick and will more often be a slow process. Don't let the changes discourage you, try to be open to the process and even be open with your next therapist about it. They can help with those feeling of abandonment too."

"" What where you wearing?""
""Were you drunk?""
""How many sexual partners have you had?""
""Why were you out at that time?'
""Why were you alone?""
""Are you sure you didn't misinterpret the other person's intent?""

Answer those wrong and you're a whore that was asking for it and therefore deserve it.

Sexual assault is one of the only crimes where the victim will have to sit in court and hear how this is destroying their attacker's bright future. And how they were really at fault or otherwise mistaken. And it is one of the only crimes where the victim is treated as a bald faced liar from the start.

After being victimized the way sexual assault victims are hard pressed to feel safe reporting. And it's even worse considering the social status of both the victim and the attacker. Look at all the famous people who have been caught and hot to not only walk away but still have adoring fans and all of the less famous rich people who aren't really rapists they just have affluenza and are too rich to understand that no means no."
