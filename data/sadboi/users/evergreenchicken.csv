bipolar,fb0vr57,t1_faztq25,1576429712.0,Haha.... Prank
bipolar,fb0uxo7,t3_eayjv6,1576429492.0,Happy birthday!!
bipolar,faupo73,t1_famxnro,1576350862.0,What meds are you on friend
bipolar,faffz2f,t3_e8wlxe,1576021793.0,"Off topic, but what meds do you take in the morning? Mine make me really drowzy"
bipolar,faffu86,t3_e8uxwz,1576021698.0,"Love the grip! Walking around in those socks really brings me back. I remember when I was hospitalized and I was wearing the red ones (maybe? I forget), drinking cocoa sitting in a windowsill as it was snowing outside. I had just had the worst breakdowns of my life and I almost died, but in that moment I just felt good. I also got on olanzapine after months of SSRIs so that also helped lol"
bipolar,faashc7,t3_e89khe,1575912954.0,"Has anyone had any experience with Vraylar? My psych wants me to switch over. Also I agree with an above comment, I've gained like 20 pounds since starting my meds"
bipolar,fa8molu,t1_fa855j6,1575849775.0,Totally get that. I also went to the doctor because I thought there was something wrong with my heart. They did an EKG and nothing was wrong as well. It made me feel so crazy :(
bipolar,fa84otv,t1_fa843pt,1575841148.0,Hate the heart beat thing. It just feels awful. Taking a beta-blocker helps though
bipolar,fa17fsr,t3_dwreql,1575765806.0,"This was me years ago. Went to my pediatrician (because I had no idea who to go to) and told them I just felt really bad sometimes for no reason since I couldn't really explain my feelings yet and they put me on Prozac. Once I tried to kill myself, my parents brought me to the world's shittiest psychiatrist and once I told him I was hearing voices and objects were talking to me he flat out told me ""no, that's not happening. I'm going to put you on X SSRI and we're just going to keep trying different ones until something works"". Then, a few years and a few hospitalizations later, I meet an amazing psychiatrist who diagnoses me the first visit and put me on an antipsychotic and mood stabilizer and I CANNOT believe how much better I feel."

It just feels so weird, like an invasion of privacy. Tbh they're coming at me like ""this is non-negotiable, it needs to happen"" and I'm freaking out. It's likey own space, I never see my therapist outside of that and it's like a place that exists out of space and time for me. It's like it doesn't exist to other people and it's special for me. Idk I feel so conflicted about this"
