(Anyone who's read a psych textbook would tell you Freud is a figurehead whose theories paved the way for psychoanalysis as we see it now, but his theories have been thoroughly denounced by mainstream Psychology.) 

Also, unless we are going into Psychiatry, which is a premed degree to begin with, or are working on our doctorates to become psychologists (which are usually the clinicians running and observing studies for various new treatments), our professions, social workers, therapists, case workers, etc, don't require hard sciences like chemistry or biology to do our jobs. We need things like cultural anthropology, and world religions, geriatric psychology and drugs and addiction. We have to know the behavior and outcomes for people as a whole. Not their biochemistry. As for math, the only major requirement we need is Statistics, which makes sense if we're going to understand how prevalent an issue is in our area and how many resources are out there to fix it. 

Furthermore, it's considered a soft science due to too many variables in the human condition. We are constantly changing and evolving. So no, many of our studies do change over time, but that doesn't devalue the contribution psychology has made to society. 

Every psych major I have met went into this field because it resonates on a personal level. I've met some psych majors who seem cold upon first meeting them, but once an acquaintanceship has been established, they're generally nice people. First years are usually irritating though, as they seem to think they know the answers to everyone's problems, so I will give you that, but they generally don't last and, tend to go into nursing at my school."

I'm a direct support professional with 8 years of service with people with developmental disabilities. 

Agression during basic hygiene is incredibly common due to overstimulation, prior abuse, aversion, and many other triggers. 

I have 2 individuals (in a group home of 8), who require serious prep time every day before we get into their hygiene tasks. These people require a second staff to be present because of their aggression and possibility of harm to themselves and others. 

As for agression towards staff in the homes, it is A.) Incredibly common (3 staff died in an agency in Massachusetts a few years ago), and B.) Usually a result of an individual being upset and not being able to properly express how they are feeling.

Our state's self-harm rate for individuals is vastly lower than that of harm towards staff. 

Do I think it's our people's fault? Absolutely not. Do I think it's our staff's fault? Also no. 

Our qualifications to be a staff are; be 18, have at least a high school diploma or equivalent, and take 6 weeks of online training. 

My people are the reason I've spent all of my 20's working for them. I love seeing them every day. However, their behaviors are not to be taken lightly. This is how you end up getting hurt. It takes a multitude of skills, patience, and intuition to handle  a situation that can turn violent."
