depression,fny5pqw,t3_g4km7o,1587354051.0,"Yeah I think mine is more of me seeing the world as a pointless repetitive motion over and over working eating sleeping fucking fighting stress depression repeat repeat repeat. If there is a god they are a troll and if there isn’t then what different are we than another animal that just isn’t as intelligent. Humans are obviously creatures of companionship but that begs the question, what is the reason any one feels lonely? Is it simply lack of being around others? Or is it past traumatic experience that sets us off in a lonely abyss? I believe there is no answer to those questions, it’s simply biology. Our brains crave communication with everything and it sucks. This really sets me back because personally I wouldn’t mind being lonely if there weren’t other people. Since there are other people they are always around me doing relationship type things and I don’t care remotely. Deep down though I know I will never be happy unless I have a sexual or romantic relationship with another person. It’s weird for me. I don’t know how it is for you but to me it feels like I have a genetic flaw that limits me, to a degree always desiring to reproduce with another human or be around other humans to express my thoughts, feelings, and ideas. I hope you find someone who gives you the spark to feel whole. Perhaps I wish I could give my life so that to everyone else in the universe could have that connection of being synchronized with another being."

The most fucked up part is that you can’t ask a dead person if the afterlife is real."

depression,fan7zil,t1_fan7mq1,1576228165.0,"Also if you don’t wanna read all that, I’ll say just get the fuck away from your toxic family and learn to live away from them and do things for yourself. Living independently has allowed me to grow away from my depression more than anything. I can do the things I want to do and find people who relate to me and help me grow not just take from me. If people do take from me I let them know I’m not someone to be pushed around anymore. I do things for a reason and I learn from my mistakes. You can get past things with time learning how to make it through life isn’t easy, i haven’t mastered it and probably never will. But there are ways you can learn to live a decently happy life even if it is alone, at least doing what you enjoy sometimes."

I found my interest after searching for over 10 years, with sustainable technologies.

depression,f6rb7od,t1_f6r4r3n,1573098522.0,"I feel like the root of the problem is being smart enough to realize what life is before you’re over 18. You see the same repetitive bs cycles happening everywhere. The world just turns and turns no matter what, people do the same thing forever. I believe obsessing over these kind of thoughts and similar ones is what leads to this lack of motivation or not wanting to try. It’s hard to see getting through anything when you see a fire all around you. How can you see the light at the end of the road, when you see the whole system of society as a trap to work forever? It’s tough going into a world you aren’t prepared for, especially if you’re alone."
Fibromyalgia,f2uz6t3,t3_dec88h,1570436924.0,"As a former user of the booger sugar, I can attest to it being a decently solid defense against fibro. I’d say just stick to some cbd or herb. 

Continue reading from here for somewhat ranty/ insomnia driven words 

Also keeping in mind I was using it for fibro before anyone talked about fibro. Haha I honestly didn’t care about my health then because I thought I was going to die from an unknown disease. 

Anyways luckily I didn’t use coke too long so no permanent damage but if you aren’t like me and have an addictive personality I wouldn’t recommend it. 

I’ve seen a couple of friends who just loved the feeling and I watched as their lives fell apart. One of them was so bad at one point, I flushed his 1/4 oz of coke down the toilet. He was literally so addicted he would just stay up all night in his house railing lines."
depression,f2uyngq,t1_f2u3sjv,1570436033.0,"Lowkey this is how I feel. Like bruh I feel like being dead  sometimes because of my circumstances, I’m sure everyone has their own. But doesn’t mean I’m actually gonna do it, life has ups and downs I guess. The really good days make up for the majority of my days, which are generally shitty. 

Also I’m not going to tell people that I’m depressed for them to think I’m suicidal, just a lot of my joy seems sapped out of me. 

Here, at the end of my rant, work is work, you need money from work to live, some people find success and enjoyment in work, while others are stuck on paths they hate. Leading to depression and unhappiness, just my thoughts. I try to find things and/or hobbies that motivate me to make it thru the day to day!"

depression,eoevenj,t3_brcz28,1558509767.0,"Well I’m kind of in a similar boat but just keep in mind it’s probably hard for people to relate or even know what to do for someone in our situation. If they are even trying to hang out or see what your up to I would take it as them asking how you’re doing man. Because for the longest time I was the same way, but I realized I was being selfish and toxic just because of my depression. I realized if someone is trying to hang out with me even though I don’t ever ask them to and they are proactively trying to cater to what I want to do then it must be something close to what I’ve been searching for. I can’t just always expect everyone to do everything to help me get better I must be proactive regardless of how hard it is because the more I take care of myself and do better the more easy it becomes to be a better human mentally and physically. Cheers mate I hope your life gets better. Literally less than a week ago I was in such depression I almost pulled the trigger on my 12 gauge. Hope I’m not just on a high right now but anyways good luck hommie."
