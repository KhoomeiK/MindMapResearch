ismailis,fqpqa9a,t1_fqpge0p,1589551947.0,"That's the hadith, not the Qur'an, and it's also really misleading

The people of Sodom and Gamorrah were having gay orgies for centuries and God didn't do anything about it. But when Lot brought the message of God, they rejected the message and then tried to rape him. It was only then that God brought down punishment. A lot of people see this as ""god hates gay people"" but I think it's pretty obvious it means that you shouldn't rape people or reject the message of God."

The younger half of the jamat is overall pretty open and accepting in my experience but you will probably get some judgment from the older half of the jamat."

In fact the only place we differ in the understanding of Jesus is that Muslims don't believe Jesus is the son of God and we don't believe in the resurrection after crucifixion. Other than that, Jesus (or Nabi Isa as we call him) is a very important figure in both faiths, mentioned in the Qur'an many times! Both faiths believe in a single God. If you're asking for my advice is would teach the child about both faiths whether they are raised Ismaili or Catholic as they teach many of the same lessons, just in different ways."
