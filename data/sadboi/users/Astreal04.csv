You need to be direct and ask him what's going on and whether he still has feelings for her and/or is waiting for something to happen between them. At least you'll know what he's up to. There's really no point torturing yourself like this and thinking about how things might be."

The fact that you don't like how she smells is actually not a trivial thing. You'll eventually start disliking it a lot more and it might even come up in future heated arguments. It seems trivial but it definitely isn't. It is possible to be in love with someone without being attracted to her (assuming you aren't asexual since you are ""looking"" at other women).

Sex is important to you but you also feel that you love her and don't want to lose the (possible) love of your life. You need to weigh the pros and cons now. You can stay with her but you might end up being sexually frustrated all your life (that often leads to cheating-- doesn't mean that you'll do that but it is a possibility).

The point is, you have to decide how strong and/deep these feelings you have, are. If you can move on emotionally but remain friends, then that's great.

The first thing is that you need to look better in your own eyes first. Whatever you weight, height, you need to feel good being in your body. You can always change partners but you can't change your body. So deal with that first. You said you're already trying to best to reduce weight, keep it up.

You see, people have a rather short attention span. If you don't crack this exam, yeah they might laugh, mock you. But the thing is, in a few days or weeks, your unsuccessful attempt will become yesterday's news. That's just how it is. Consider the worst possible scenario : you don't crack the exam, your parents are disappointed and your neighbors laugh at you. This is literally how bad it can get and trust me life can get a lot worse than this. Also, being a child of your parents, you'll be disappointing them a lot more in your coming years. That's just how it is. That's the normal.
So considering all this, believe me that 10-15years down the line when you think back to this day, you will be glad that you hadn't done something stupid (yes, taking your life for something like this will seem stupid when you're 30, because by then, life will have hurt you a lot more and you would have emerged from those victorious).
The problem with you (and your peers) is that you have been brain washed to believe that getting into an IIT is the best possible thing that can happen to your life. And if you can't get it you are a loser. Honestly, if that were really true, people from all over the world would have been trying to get into an IIT.

Sometimes ladies do post here and I'm sure that they get a lot of messages, but you have to understand something. If a woman makes a post, ( a post like she wants to start a conversation and maybe that may lead to a date or something more), she usually gets a lot of responses. She gets to pick and choose. She isn't going to like everyone she talks to. That might just be the main reason for ghosting, because it's easier to ghost than to actually say it out loud, that you're not interested. That's what ghosting is supposed to indicate. It's equivalent to not being interested.

I understand that it might actually feel bad if you're ghosted by someone you actually ended up liking. So here's my question. Were you guys ghosted by strangers (in the sense that you exchanged a few texts for a few days and that was it)? Or were you ghosted by women who met up, and then ghosted you?

Because the first one, is very probable. They are strangers, they don't owe you any explanation. But the second one is just sad.

People take up majors in college without even undergoing the college curriculum. They make a decision based on their experience with the school curriculum. That's really sort of silly, if you think about it. But they DO take that decision, pick their direction. You have to do it too. 

If you don't know what to do, then try to figure out what you can't do. Idk what career options you have in mind, but whatever they are, however stupid, just write them down on a paper. Search the internet and figure out all possibilities for a person from your educational background. Now after that, start striking off those that you know for sure you'll never do. For whatever reason. For example, for me, it'd be something like being a nurse or a doctor. Getting into that profession means I have to deal with blood, injections and other horrid sights- I won't be able to stomach that so that profession isn't for me.

Try doing this first. Contact your counselor in college too and have a discussion with him/her.

Now comes the hard part. You have to pick something based on your guts (and rather blindly) and then go for it. Have faith in yourself and give it your best (after all, these are the only two things that you can control). 

I was someone who was very sure about what she wanted from life and which career to take. And I didn't listen to anyone who tried to deter me from pursuing my goals.

It broke my heart to hear those things from him. And on top of that, I was suddenly horrified of myself. I felt so ugly that I couldn't look at myself in the mirror.

r4rindia,evcj742,t1_evcip0q,1564416441.0,"I totally agree with you. Nobody wants to admit their flaws so it's futile to write like this. But then again,I believe the OP wrote this to give a rough idea of what she expects. It's a lot like ""smoking is dangerous"" sign on the pack of cigarettes but you still smoke anyway.
I did try writing but it always turned out looking weird, so I never posted them. It feels really weird to talk about myself like that, instead of being in a conversation, which is not only easier, but also provides you with enough context. So yeah. All these have been constant deterrents in my case."

r4rindia,evceavu,t1_evcdidd,1564413214.0,"Okay. Well, I often felt like making a post here. But when I started writing I went blank. I ran out of points to write about myself. This post indeed gives me a template (and yes of course it looks like a checklist) in the sense that I can talk about myself along these lines(and the post does tell something about the OP as she has mentioned that she checks the points she herself expects from the guy).
And yes ofc, she'll receive responses regardless of what she wrote."

Couples looking for unicorns

Some guys with some serious aunty fetish (Not judging, but it's cool XD)"
r4rindia,ev1vvxa,t3_ci28bd,1564166050.0,"I am a woman, and I guess I am eligible to respond here now, without being assumed to be a guy.

I tried to talk to guys on this sub. And I have talked to quite a few.

First problem, I got asked for pics for verification. Why would I send a pic to a random stranger?  I understand the problem which guys have created for themselves by catfishing but that doesn't warrant demanding pics for verification. This is just unfortunate.

Second, most guys I talked to here, were not close to my age. I am 26. I talked to most guys who were 19-21 or well above 30. I guess it's my personal problem that I have trouble conversing with people from these age groups.

The reason why I am here is because I wanted a nice conversation, and maybe a date, if things go well and we're in the same city. Apparently, these two things are hard to work out together. Chances are, you're not from my city (from my experience of talking to guys from here).

I haven't had the misfortune to talk to ""creeps"", yet. If I did come across one, there's always an option to ignore.

I don't assume that all guys are creepy or desperate or horny all the time. And if some guy does end up behaving this way, doesn't mean that the rest will be the same.

But I guess, things just don't seem to work out here."
relationship_advice,euprp6r,t3_ch67yc,1563962925.0,"I didn't bring it up with my ex. I broke up with him. I honestly didn't know how to talk about something like this because clearly, to him, his lifestyle was normal.
I eventually broke up because I couldn't bear to witness him like this and also, I really couldn't see anything long term come out of it. I can't change someone. I realized that if I did take it long term, then I would just get more and more frustrated, and eventually leave making things very ugly."
depression,eu6zoej,t1_eu6zk4i,1563513400.0,"It feels that way now. But life is a creative bitch and it will come up with new ways to fuck you up. What feels like ""brain damage"" now, will seem nothing later.
Just saying that you can't really avoid being fucked by life."

First of all, hats off to your efforts at socializing. You really tried.
Secondly, I understand that you're hurt and never want to do anything like this again, never be vulnerable.
The thing is, life is like playing a match. Of football for example. If you want to play you gotta run the risk of getting seriously hurt too.
So yes you tried to play, got hurt. Now take rest, recover. And then come back again.
It's all about trying.
But do take your time. Stay away from all this for a while, which may even be a year or more, and recover."

The point is that with these guys catfishing out there, guys have made it harder on guys.
And yes, idk any woman who uses reddit. Really don't know why."
