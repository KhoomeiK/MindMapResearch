I know trainers who have ridden at the Olympic level for decades and have nothing. Honestly, it's a minimalist profession. You cant have a significant other, pets, children, or a life outside the barn. Most people who make it are rich, crooked, or lucky; but it's a mix.

Also if I may, that we should accept full responsibility for our pitfalls.  Sometimes, it's not our fault, and we were set up to fail.  

Bad managers use this tactic quite a lot.  They make calculated closed room decisions, and the employee is invited to accept responsibility for those decisions.  If they don't accept responsibility as they've gotten railroaded, they're narcissistic, and can't take responsibility for ""their"" actions.  

Another good example are toxic ""friends"" that set people up.  Narcissists.  

I will concede that people should own their actions, and take responsibility for those.  They should critically analyze, and figure out their level or degree of responsibility in any given situation.  Most times, it is within the spectrum you mention.  Sometimes, it's 0% or 100%.  

But shaming people to take responsibility for everything is a way of avoiding responsibility for their actions."
