Psychic,fi81jvc,t1_fi7wfla,1582231723.0,"Hi! Your card is Aries so either of you could be that sign but it states 1 week / 1 month. For a relationship it states, "" A new encounter (but not necessarily an intimate episode), that promises a new prospective in your life. ""

I clarified it with an oracle and got 'envy' in the reverse. Which asks you not focus on future longings but to make sure you stay in the present. It asks you to release and old feelings of lack and envy and you'll be well on your way to a gratifying life. 

Both of these seem eerily similar. üíô"
Psychic,fi80wbd,t1_fi7waxs,1582231376.0,"Hi! Your card is 8. Which states 8 days/8 weeks. Either way, the number eight is significant. 

The card states, "" everything is in progress""
It also states that after a time of stasis, apathy, or mental block, the energy will now burst forward and flow harmoniously again. 

I clarified this with a oracle and it seems like your first chakra has either been blocked and is now open or it is currently blocked right now."

Relationship wise, it states, ""Nobody else can make you absolutely and permanently happy. Every relationship needs a common, spiritual goal. God, Jesus Christ, buddha, nature.""

I feel your old person is definitely still in your energy. The queen of swords usually indicates someone who has has enough if someone is is really harsh with her communication. She's guarded and she's usually a good indicator of someone being blocked. Plus you got the six of cups which represents someone from the past or thinking about the past. Can also represent soulmate energy.

you have the king of pentacles, strength, and the ace of pentacles. 

Heavy leo energy, earth energy, and water. 

I clarified the king of pentacles and got the eight of pentacles and the sun. 

Your person is either really focused on work right now or they're working on their happiness with the sun card here. I clarified this with an oracle and the energy that I'm getting is that your person is really into their money and work so they may not be as focused on the relationship right now. 


With the strength card here, I clarified it with the two of swords, the hermit and the five of cups. So someone here may have or will have to make a difficult decision to withdraw from the relationship and they're trying to find the strength to overcome the emotional hurt. 


But with the ace of pentacles here, I do see a new beginning happening. A new offer of commitment that will be stable and secure. I clarified this with the queen of cups which is all about having deep love and emotion and being loyal and caring. So this water sign could be sending this offer or receiving. But definitely doesn't have to be water, I just see that really heavy here with the queen of cups."

Taurus energy, cancer energy, and gemini, libra, or Aquarius. 


Your person is on the fence. Not really making a move and torn between a choice. With the hierophant, they do want a traditional relationship with you and they want to move forward. 

You guys may not be talking? I got the high priestess and the queen of swords. Someone here is very guarded, may have blocked the other but there is definitely some nostalgia and thinking about this past person."
Psychic,fhwk7bn,t1_fhwimn5,1581918475.0,"Hi! Your cards are the king of swords, the eight of pentacles, and justice. You could be an air sign but the king of swords is someone who is logical, uses his head over his heart and he's a kind of guarded because he's been through a lot and doesn't really open up to anyone easily. 

The eight of pentacles is all about hard work. You could be distracting yourself with work or you could be putting the work in on yourself on order to be your best self. 

The justice card here can indicate court but I went ahead and clarified it with the heirophant and it seems like you're either married or your headed for a serious commitment because the universe is wanting to bring you some justice. 


I went back and clarified the king of swords and got the ace of pentacles, the ten of cups and the king of cups. Wow! You definitely have a new love offer coming in that will be solid, stable, and secure with that ace of pentacles. The ten of cups is a card of marriage that leads to the ultimate happiness and children and the king of cups is someone who is has deep emotions or love, care and he is loyal! Could be a water sign coming towards you.


I went back and clarified the eight of pentacles and got the strength card. So it's possible you're a leo or your just working on your strength right now and overcoming some emotional challenges. 

Either way, I see  love is headed towards you."
Psychic,fhwjrp3,t1_fhwiq1s,1581918054.0,"I have the knight of wands, the six of cups and the ace of swords. 

The knight of wands is fire energy and can indicate someone who may have been in and out. This person could have been a player, giving to more than one person and playing mind games because they're not sure what they want. 


The six of cups respresents the last. Feeling nostalgic and thinking about past memories. This could be a childhood friend/love and a soulmate. I clarified with the three of wands. Someone here could be waiting and waiting for this person from the last to come back. 


The ace of swords here represents success, clarity, truthful communication and breakthroughs. I clarified with the death card (Scorpio energy) the chariot (cancer energy, the wheel of Fortune, the nine of cups and the seven of wands. I didn't want all those but they fell out all at once. üòÇ 

Overall, yes, you guys will be together. Whatever challenges you were facing will be overcome but you guys will need to be truthful with one another."
Psychic,fhwjdd3,t1_fhwif0w,1581917677.0,"Hi! I have the nine of cups, the king of swords, and the seven of wands. Heavy air energy and Pisces. 

The nine of cups indicates wish fulfillment, happiness and contentment. So whatever you're wishing for can and will happen. 

The king of swords is someone who is realistic, logical, and stern. He makes careful decisions because he thinks things through thoroughly. 

The seven of wands indicates challenges arising but being overcome with determination and strong will. 

So it looks like things will work out for you if you want them to. There will be some obstacles to overcome but if you're persistent, logical, and realistic, it can definitely happen."

I have the eight of cups and the queen of swords. I clarified the eight of cups and got the queen of cups. So dealing with water energy (cancer pisces, Scorpio) and air energy (gemini, libra, Aquarius). 

The eight of cups is all about walking away from things that no longer serve you. You could have walked away from your person or vice versa. But the queen of swords is an energy of someone being very guarded. He could feel that you're not really emotionally invested or that you're just not willing to put up with his shit any more.


I went ahead and pulled an oracle for him and got ' Door to Personal Healing and Happiness' I clarified this with tarot and got the devil (Capricorn energy). So it looks like any negative energies in the relationship or within you or your person are being healed right now. I feel like your person might be wanting to come towards you but they're working on some things right now."

The ten of cups in the reverse here is the daycare. In a career sense, it's a card of having a job that deals with working with families (can also indicate a career of social work). Reversed, it honestly represents that neglect or abuse that was happening in the daycare. This card also represents social services getting involved. (Tens in tarot also represent endings/completion). 

This person feels really unbalanced right now with the two of cups in the reverse. Represents disharmony, this is also a card that can indicate abuse in the reverse. Career wise, it's card of business partnerships going wrong and clashing with coworkers. 

With the six of swords here, they definitely didn't see this coming. It's about trouble coming out of nowhere and having nowhere to run. With this card, the boat has been rocked and things are really stirred up. 

With the six of wands in the reversed they feel very unsuccessful, unconfident and pretty much like a failure. Again, another car of feeling unstable and at a loss. 

The magician card is a powerful card. It's about having the power and the tools to create whatever you desire. However it's how you use those tools. The magician can also be a card of using that power for manipulation, trickery, greed. 

The page of pentacles is simply bad news. 

The justice card represents an injustice being done here. This person may be trying to avoid their karma and has a lack of accountability for their actions. Justice in reverse is also a card of dishonesty. 

With the world reversed they feel very disappointed, a lack of success and possibly even stuck. The world reversed is often seen as a card of lack of closure or unfinished business. 

Lastly, the five of swords reversed can be seen as a card of moving on after a conflict but oddly enough, it's also a card of a crime being uncovered, being held accountable for actions and even possibly arrest."

Psychic,fhgm4hy,t3_f34ahg,1581571053.0,"Loving someone does not mean you have to be with them. I learned that the hard way when I had to separate from my person. I do my own readings all the time and it's always hard to see things that I don't want to see. If a relationship is not meant to be, then it will not be. That is always the case. If you're relationship is fine, you don't really need to turn to tarot and if you're just very desperate to find out how it will end and the cards indicate separation then, you can't really be upset. 

Alternatively, yes there is free will. I can see my cards all day long telling me not to do something or to change things in my life but I go against them all the time. I'm stubborn. The Cards are here to guide you. Not necessarily to predict your future. The guidance is for you to follow but you're not expected to. A lot of my cards tell me to let go but instead I hold on. Usually holding on results on me staying hurt or in a bad situation. But the cards indicate that if I let go, there is better. Deep down, I know there is better but it's really hard to let go and so most people don't. 

If things are fine in the relationship, there's no need to be fearful. You'll take what you need/ learn and grow from the relationship and when or if the time comes to move forward without them, then it will happen."
Psychic,fhg3jtr,t3_f31xxu,1581557775.0,"Is it upright? The five of swords can honestly go two ways. Way one is someone surrendering after being defeated. Way two is someone being deceptive and causing conflict. 

In a workplace setting, the five of swords usually represents there being conflict , hostility, arguments, stress and feeling defeated as if you need to walk away from your job. 


The nine of pentacles is all about independence. 
It could be someone leaving their job to work for themselves/be their own boss or someone who is prosperous and successful through the work they've done. Take it how it resonates."

both the seven of cups and the four of cups are cards for someone dreaming or really being in their head a lot.

So it looks like this relationship will have some burdens/challenges. Things will get really stressful and one or the other may feel like giving up (Ten of wands).

The four of wands here is a card of commitments (possibly even marriage) and having a stable, happy relationship,"
Psychic,fha34ar,t1_fh9udnc,1581395901.0,"Hmm. You got the king of pentacles (earth energy) The king of swords (Air energy) and the four of pentacles. Could be dealing with an earth sign or an air sign here. 

I clarified the king of pentacles with the two of pentacles and the page of swords. This king of pentacles is juggling right now. Could be two places or two things. He might be conflicted and thinking (should I, shouldn't I) The page of swords can indicate spying/ watching from a distance in order to gather some information and/or holding back.   


Next the king of swords is someone who is guarded (could be you or him, take it how it resonates) The king of swords uses his head over his heart and is ready to cut anyone off at any given moment if hes pissed off. The Kind of swords speaks truthfully. Communication could be blocked here. I clarified the king of swords and got the page of pentacles and the four of wands. This person could be wanting to come forwards and speak truthful communication. The page of pentacles indicates news/messages coming in and the four of wands indicates commitment, coming together and reconciliation. 

&#x200B;

The four of pentacles can represent someone holding on or holding back. I clarified this with the four of cups and it looks like someone here might be holding on to the past or holding back sending an offer right now. (contemplating about sending it but holding back). Other meanings for these two is that someone could be holding on to regret from things that happened in the past or being guarded because of what happened in the past."

Someone could have been giving to someone else (third party situation). there are lots of ways this could have gone.

The page of pentacles reversed is someone who is all talk and no actions. This could be someone younger than you. Preferably an air sign. The page of swords in reverse is also someone who holds back from speaking the truth or any other information.

Energies can be vice versa here. 

So with the queen of cups, you could be a water sign (doesn't have to be though). The queen of cups is someone who is kind, caring and has deep, deep emotions. This is someone who loves a lot but is also able to keep their emotions in check (emotionally stable). The eight of cups here symbolizes walking away from things that no longer serves you and the four of wands reversed to clarify looks like someone is walking away from some king of relationship (could be a marriage). The four of wands reversed can represent being unhappy in a relationship, feeling unstable or going through a rough time. It can also signify canceled celebrations like weddings or reunions. 


Next we have the world card which indicates conclusions, completions and the closing of cycles in order to start a new cycle. Clarified by the heirophant (Taurus energy) which is a good card to indicate marriage. There could be a ending to a marriage here. Or some kind of cycle being completed. The heirophant can also indicate seeking counseling. Take it how it resonates. 


Advice oracle I got for you is honesty. It's a card of clarity and true communication. You needing to be honest with yourself about what exactly it is you want, you're thinking, and your true feelings. When you choose honestly, the divine will send you the courage you need to do what's right. I clairifed this with the strength card (leo energy). 


The strength card here shows me that being honest with yourself or others will give you the strength, courage, and power  you need to overcome any challenges you are facing."

So throughout your whole spread I'm getting cards of twos. It seems like you're going to have to choose between more than one person. The two of wands indicates having to make a choice between two things and the six of pentacles can represents giving  to more that one person. 

On the contrary, your person could be someone you meet at a distance (like traveling) or someone who has been watching you from a distance for quite awhile now and they wants to give to you as the six of pentacles also represents generousity and balance."

With the six of cups here, this can very well be someone from your past, possibly a childhood friend or just someone in your past life. Heavy soulmate energy. The queen of pentacles is someone who is loyal, dependable, stable, and caring. This is someone who would make a good mother or father figure and wants to provide for you."
Psychic,fgrgtgt,t1_fgr8zsr,1581046461.0,"Hi, AR!

So it looks like you may be dealing with someone who has secrets and withholds information from you (high priestess). The five of coins indicates feeling left out in the cold, at a loss and abandoned. The four of swords indicates needing to isolate yourself in order to heal and meditate. And the three of swords indicates heartbreak and grief. So it really looks like you're going to be going through a lot. 


For the zodiac signs you have the devil card and the fool card. The devil card represents Capricorn energy and the fool card represents an aquarius so it could be either of those or this person may have both energies in their birth chart. 


For the intentions we have the six of pentacles reversed and the two of cups. With the two of cups here this person is definitely going to be a Soulmate and someone you have strong feelings for. But there six of pentacles in the reverse represents unrequited love. Someone here may be taking more than they are giving and this is going to put the relationship at an imbalance.

For what you can expect coming towards you, the page of pentacles represents a message. I clarified this with the strength card and the four of wands.
It's possible that someone will be trying to find the strength to send you a message about being together. The four of wands represents reunuon, commitment, and stability. 


The zodiac sign of this person is possibly a Virgo. The hermit card indicates withdrawing and isolation/ghosting so it's very much possible this is someone you withdrew from or vice versa.

What you can expect is coming out of mental conflict.   It's possible that you're not the most confident person and you may have some thoughts that make you feel very conflicted but with the five of wands reversed you're going to start coming out of that. The king of wands is someone who is confident, assertive and motivated and dependable. 


For the zodiac sign , you got the knight of wands. Your person will likely be a fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius). 

For their intentions, your person is going to bring you some hope and inspiration. The king of pentacles (Taurus, Virgo Capricorn) is you. And the ten of wands represents feeling overloaded, stressed, and just struggling. But the star card here shows that there will be hope, healing and positivity in your life because of this person."

1. You can expect someone coming towards you who wants to bring justice into the situation. This person may have done an injustice to you in the past and now they're coming towards you to make things right. 

For the zodiac sign I'm getting earth energy (taurus) but I also clarified this with the death card which is virgo energy (but this could very much be you). Either way, Taurus Virgo or Capricorn. With both these cards here it seems like this is someone you know already and have ended things with. 

For their intentions the eight of wands signifies communication or traveling towards you. I clarified this with the ace of wands and your person wants a brand new beginning with you. Both of these cards indicate tons of passion! 

You could also be dealing with a cancer. But earth energy is very heavy in your spread."
Psychic,fgr9gtr,t1_fgr8d6v,1581041397.0,"Hi, Tatiana !

With the queen of pentacles here (earth energy), you can expect someone who is loyal, dependable, down to earth and successful. 

So I'm getting heavy earth sign energy for your person (taurus, virgo, capricorn). Preferably a Taurus. It's possible this is someone who you stopped talking to as the five of pentacles represents feeling left out in the cold. This person wants to reconnect with you. 

For their intentions the chariot signifies overcoming obstacles, success and victory. Whomever is coming towards you expects to be victorious in winning you over. If this is someone from your past, they want to overcome the obstacles that you both were facing. 

I see a lot of cards that indicate success in your spread so your next relationship will be a good one!"
Psychic,fgl2f3v,t1_fgkt9ng,1580879915.0,"Hi! Three cards I got for you are the two of cups , the nine of cups, and the ten of wands. Although mostly seen as a 'love' card, the two of cups in a work-related sense represents getting that balance and partnership that you would like. It represents equality and offers that will give you all of the above. I clarified this and got the king of wands. The king of wands is fire sign energy (aries, leo, Sagittarius) so this is definitely you. 


Next, the nine of cups represents wish fulfillment. Whatever you have been manifesting is coming and I clarified it with the ten of cups! Such a great card. Your wish will bring you abundance in more that one way that will benefit your life greatly. The ten of cups is all about success, fulfillment, family, happiness, etc. 


Next we have the ten of wands and the wheel of Fortune. The ten of wands is a card of someone feeling tired, stressed, overwhelmed and ready to give up but with the wheel of Fortune here, it looks like things are about to turn around for you. 



While shuffling for a oracle, one card fell out for you.

'A new start is coming' 


Looks like that feeling you got about a manifestation coming is real."
Psychic,fgl0lqg,t1_fgkt74x,1580878390.0,"Hi! Not sure what happened between you both but it must have been hectic. These cards can be how you feel or how you're person feels. 

You got the magician clarified by the world card. The magician would indicate your person (libra energy). I clarified the magician and got the world card. Looks like your person feels like this is a closed chapter. The world card indicates a cycle ending and being finished.

Next we got the eight of swords and the five of pentacles. The eight of swords is a card of feeling trapped, confined, backed into a corner. It's also a card of major anxiety and hopelessness. Clarified with the five of pentacles, your person feels like they were abandoned, left out in the cold and at a loss and it brings them a lot of anxiety.

Next is the page of swords, the ace of wands, and the justice card. The justice card here triumphs the others. Whoever was done wrong here may want justice from the situation. I have the feeling that it was you who may have hurt this person. It's possible that they would like for you to reach out. But it's also possible that you would like to bring justice into the situation and reach out to make things right? I clarified the justice card and got the knight of pentacles which is a slow offer.

Okay so someone here wants to bring justice into the situation by reaching out and giving some kind of offer that is solid and stable and committed. But with the page of swords here, they're just holding back for the time being and gathering information. Could possibly be looking at the other's social media or driving by their home if in the same area. 


For what your person remembers I got the five of swords and the eight of cups. Your person has the breakup heavy in their mind. The five of swords is all about giving up, surrending and defeat whereas the eight of cups is about walking away and separation."
Psychic,fgkze2h,t1_fgksu9v,1580877423.0,"Hi! Seems like your person is really holding back how they feel about you. 

I got the strength cards with the queen of pentacles. 
Your person is trying to find the inner strength and confidence right now. 


Next I got the page of swords clarified by the lovers and the four of wands. 

The page of swords can definitely be your person holding back. It seems like they want to speak truth to you but they are being gaurded. With the lovers card here and the four of wands your person may already know they're you're their soulmate but is keeping that information to themselves. 

Next I got the eight of swords and the ten of pentacles. Your person is really in their head about this. They feel trapped mentally right now or it's possible they can't come towards you at the moment due to being stuck in some kind of family situation.


Lastly I got the two of cups and the high priestess in reverse. Yeah, your person really cares about you/loves you (take it how it resonates) and with the high priestess reversed they may come forwards and let you know how they feel. But alternatively this can indicate that your person knows that you're thier soulmate but they are not following their intuition."
Psychic,fgkygqb,t1_fgksm6k,1580876709.0,"Hi! Three cards that fell out while shuffling on your question:

Nine of cups, ace of wands, two of cups

No negative card here so their intentions are pure."
Psychic,fgky3d2,t1_fgksk55,1580876425.0,"Hi! For how your person feels about you I got the queen of cups clarified by the hermit. With the hermit here, your person may have withdrawn from you, isolated themselves or may not be communicating. The queen of cups here shows me that although your person is withdrawn, they do have very deep emotions for you. They care about you immensely but they have their emotions under control and holds back expressing that love. 

Next I got the magician and the ten of pentacles. Someone here is manifesting one or the other back into their lives. The magician is a card of having all the tools necessary to create ones reality. You can think of the magician as a Wizard. the ten of pentacles in this case is all about investing in trying to make things happen. In another sense the ten of pentacles is a very great card  to get in love. It  represents a stable, solid and secure relationship that is long term. Looks like either you or your person is manifesting that. 

Lastly I got the ten of wands, the knight of cups, the page of swords, and the strength card. In sum, someone is feeling very burdened and overwhelmed as if they want to give up (ten of wands) But it looks like your person really want to come forward and offer love (knight of cups). Right now they're probably watching you or stalking your social media in order to see if you're dating anyone because the page of swords is all about holding back, being patient , and gathering information before speaking up. With the strength card here, your person is trying to work up the strength to send this offer."
Psychic,fgkwzym,t1_fgksjpf,1580875613.0,"Hi, EL. 

The oracle I received for you when asking what's blocking your love life is 'Skull of Stars'

This card talks about thinking small. It states that it's easy to feel small in a world that is so busy and seemingly self absorbed. We can feel lost and unclear about our direction and lose sight of our place in the cosmos. It asks you to think bigger about your future and what it is that you want. Remove false beliefs, and old ways of thinking that no longer serve you. Sometimes these beliefs are not even yours, they may have been imparted to you by your parents or The wider community and you have taken them on as your own. 

Cards I got for you while shuffling tarot is the five of wands and strength. This is about you needing to overcome that inner conflict with yourself. 

I also got the devil card for you which can indicate addictions, negative ways of thinking, toxic relationships, or anything that is not serving your higher purpose. 

Two moonology cards that fell for you are 

1. Your dreams need a practical plan (full moon in Taurus. üíô)

2. You and your loved ones are safe.

Not sure if you have relationship issues in the past but I clarified that second card and got the four of cups and the three of swords. 

These two cards could indicate that someone in your past may have broken your heart (or vice versa). 
The three of swords is all about grief, heartbreak, sadness and you might be focusing on the negative."
Psychic,fgkvq2r,t1_fgkrx58,1580874715.0,"Hi, Jonathan! 

Two separate oracle cards I got for you mentions you having a very strong intuition so you may very well be very spiritual and possess some kind of abilities. 

For your spread I got the death card. So something is coming to an end for you and I clarified this with the star card. Whatever is ending is going to bring your wish. 

Next I got the nine of wands which is a card of having little fight left and wanting to give up but giving things one more shot. The nine of wands can also be a card of being defensive. Are your walls up? Are you allowing people in? I clarified this and got the fool card. The fool card is all about taking risks. It's about jumping from the cliff and having so much trust in yourself and the universe to catch you, even if you're scared shitless. It seems like the universe is telling you to step away from your comfort zone and do things that scare you. 


Advice cards from my moonology deck that fell for you are :

1. A personal issue reaches resolution
2. The end of a tough cycle approaches."
Psychic,fgkuaws,t1_fgkrwl4,1580873768.0,"Hi! The oracle that fell out while shuffling for you is 'Eternal love'  it states that ""love is love is love and it transcends physical death. When the body leaves us and our souls are above, our possessions no longer, nothing remains but the intertwining of love."" 


It also states that for those who are ready for a desiring partner, a significant love is close and to he ready to open up to the new experience. 

I clarified this with tarot and both the king of wands fell out and the queen of wands. Usually, in tarot when you receive the king and queen of the same suit, it's an indicator of a very deep, soulmate love. 

If you have not met your person yet, they're definitely coming. I also got the seven of wands and the empress for you. 

The seven of wands is a card of fighting your corner, overcoming difficult challenges and standing your ground. The empress indicates confidence, abundance, stability, and a new beginning. The empress is also a good indicator of a Virgo zodiac.

If not, it asks you to start now because your positive thoughts will bring you your wish faster. This card also states that now is the perfect time to get your creative juices flowing and focus on exactly what is is you want.

Other cards I pulled are the ten of wands which indicates that you're feeling very stressed and overburdened. 

The three of wands which shows you waiting for things you want to start coming towards you. I also received the heirophant in reverse. It may be that you're kind of lacking in your spirituality right now because you're not seeing the results you wanted fast enough.
