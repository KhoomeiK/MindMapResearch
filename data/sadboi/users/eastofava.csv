There‚Äôs nothing anyone can say that will make it better, but I do have two ideas, take them or leave them. One is writing Honey letters, like a journal, saying everything you would say if she were still there. My therapist suggested this when I suffered a loss and it was hard but helpful. 

Second, I know that I had a lot of anger - and I can only imagine how much you have. Freud once said depression is anger turned inwards, so maybe try to let some of that anger out. I brought glass bottles to recycling centers just so I could break the bottles against the container walls while yelling. I also bought old dishes just to break them on the floor. It sounds crazy I know but it was effective, I released a lot of anger that was pent-up inside and it didn‚Äôt hurt me or anyone else. I wish you the best!"

Let‚Äôs say the brain is basically a storeroom of file cabinets filled with information, memories, etc. It‚Äôs dark in there, but most people (neurotypicals) have a flashlight that they point to an area to find the file they want or to write a new one (when trying to learn/memorize). 

ADHDers, instead, have a bare bulb swinging from the ceiling. It will light up what we need for a second and then swing over to other things. So things often get misfiled or we can‚Äôt find what we need at the time we need it and we‚Äôre constantly just following what the bulb lights up. There‚Äôs a clock on the wall but we‚Äôre at the mercy of the swinging bulb for when we‚Äôll be able to see what time it is/how much time is passing, mine is pretty consistently in the dark so I have to rely on ones outside the room lol.
