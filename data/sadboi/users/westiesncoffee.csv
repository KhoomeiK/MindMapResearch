AmItheAsshole,fjazf3h,t3_fcj0pw,1583183520.0,"NTA, but is your sister also on the same page about health and eating? Because it may seem like a big deal to you but to her it may not seem that way, hence why she took them out to eat? Maybe if she doesn’t eat healthy it didnt seem appealing to her to cook the foods you left. But they are your kids so I can understand your frustration. Maybe have a discussion with her about it because she may have not tried to intentionally upset you!"
tretinoin,fj43k7x,t3_fbdxyl,1582999476.0,I’ve tried both and the gel dried out my face so much so I went back to cream! But that’s just been my experience because I’ve seen a lot of people on this sub prefer the gel over the cream

AmItheAsshole,fj1jrei,t1_fj1ix2v,1582921531.0,"My reaction is more for kids eating peanuts because they aren’t as careful, therefore the parents are the ones that need to be careful about that. Adults are a lot more aware (most of the time)"
AmItheAsshole,fj1ivx5,t1_fj1hllu,1582921010.0,I honestly have no clue about that. I’ve always gone to an allergist and gotten tested there periodically to monitor my allergy severity because introducing it to me would’ve been super dangerous. I’m not sure about mild allergies though.
legaladvice,fj1hv3j,t1_fj1gxvy,1582920389.0,Ooh those details are important because those bars aren’t common everywhere. I’m not sure what your rights are if it’s an 18+ bar but 21+ for drinks then.
legaladvice,fj1gueg,t3_fb0j6q,1582919780.0,Uh you can get fined or go to jail but since you’re underage I wouldn’t think you have many in that situation.
AmItheAsshole,fj1ghm5,t3_fb0cg3,1582919571.0,"YTA big time. I’m severely allergic to peanuts and there’s no way to “take precaution” of it as a child when kids like yours are touching everything and can cause a severe anaphylactic reaction from someone simply touching the same area. Peanut allergies are increasing heavily and it’s such an asshole move to have your kid eat peanuts and then go play in shit, getting those allergens everywhere. There’s only so much kids with peanut allergies can do in situations like that."
