lgbt,fpgr0dm,t1_fpffhza,1588607929.0,"Ahhhh I’m so happy for you then! Congrats :) and you are very welcome!!! <3 And if you ever return to questioning other labels in the future, that’s ok. Like I said, these things can be hard to figure out-it can be hard to dissect our desires and how much they are based on our truly natural feelings, or how much they are based on our society’s expectations, etc.-so don’t worry if someday you do figure out you are demiromantic or you figure out you aren’t demiromantic! I might even be demiromantic myself, so I understand it can be difficult to analyze/understand, especially since demiromantic isn’t as talked about as demisexual usually is (which is why I’m ofc here if you ever need anything!) 

Even  if you figure out you prefer bi or pan, or you figure out you are actually gay or straight somehow! It’ll all be ok, it’ll all work out :). But I’m glad for now you have found a word that feels comfortable. It seems like a great fit. Congrats again!!"
lgbt,fpe8vg4,t3_gcwq8q,1588542685.0,"We can’t tell you what you are. I know it’s much easier said then done-but I would suggest just going with the flow and figuring stuff out. Sexual orientation is confusing and romantic orientation can make labeling yourself even more complicated. We are lucky to be able to dissect ourselves like this, utilizing the internet to try and figure these things out. But it also can be overwhelming. 

If you ever need someone to talk to, I’m here! I’m questioning myself again, and I have plenty of experience with doing it in the past and present. You gave some detail in your post, but I still can’t tell you exactly what you are or how you should identify. Using the basic information given, I have some options: 

A) You could be someone who doesn’t have crushes a lot (demiromantic? When you need a strong bond with a person to fall for them?), but is attracted to guys and girls (and maybe other genders!) I say this because you said you had imagined relationships with boys in school, and are perhaps experiencing your first crush (?) in your friend, who’s a girl (and you also look at girls at school.) Maybe you weren’t in love with them, but you would still think about being with them intimately, or perhaps seem to desire that for the future. Think about what you “want”: do you want to be with only women? Or do you think you have it in you to want to date both? Do only women feel natural, or can both feel natural? 

B) Perhaps you are bisexual homoromantic (fine with having sex with or being attracted to 2+ genders, but you only love/date/Wanna marry people of your gender) or you could be (just to give another perspective, because I’m not sure your post really indicated this at all, but whatever)  homosexual biromantic (sexually you only “do” people of your own gender, but you can date/crush on/fall in love with! two plus genders.) Or you could even learn that you are pansexual and/or panromantic. 

C) As you figure all this out, “queer” seems to be the safest bet in regards to how you want to identify. But don’t sweat. You’ll figure it all out someday. For now, I would just try to take care of yourself, and don’t exhaust yourself with trying to “figure out who you are.” It’s easy to say labels don’t matter, but in reality, they matter very much to a LOT of people. But they’re also not everything, and it’s not like you have to figure it out immediately. Take your time and do what you have to do to figure it out, while also taking care of yourself and your mental health as you try to learn about yourself and what you like. Plenty of people are in the same boat as you, so you are not alone! 

...that might have been a lot. Sorry. But I just get where you’re coming from and wanna help :). Like I said, I’m here if ya need me."
bisexual,fp5pr5c,t1_fp58yee,1588336950.0,"Tbh I don’t like most porn in general (I usually only like specific ones or really amateur ones, or I just prefer solo acts or strip-teases) but I don’t like lesbian porn either. I mean yeah there have been amateur ones here and there like I said, but personally it’s a lot harder to see things haha! But I reaaaaally do not like most of the lesbian porn out there—it just looks ridiculous to me, or too rough. Like I said there are always exceptions—this goes for all kinds of porn for me—but don’t feel like a fake bisexual because of the porn you watch. Sometimes what we watch in porn or what comes to mind while we do ourselves isn’t always reflective of what we do or truly desire in real life. Sexuality is mad confusing! Also maybe you have a specific type of girl or something? Lesbian porn also doesn’t have a lot of body diversity typically, and it’s mostly femme. I wouldn’t worry. I’ve preferred girls my entire life as a bisexual and I barely watch lesbian stuff porn, I prefer the straight stuff because to me it’s just easier to find stuff that isn’t as fake or laugh out loud ridiculous or creepy and painful looking. Sometimes I’ve watched gay guy stuff too but that interest really comes and goes, and I’m not into a lot of what happens in the porn. I have serious issues with pain XD."

bisexual,foqhymd,t1_foq5035,1587993985.0,"Well a lot of people deal with internalized biphobia and the anxiety of constantly questioning yourself can take a serious toll on bisexual individuals. So having a place where you are being reminded that your sexual orientation and how you express your sexuality is valid is immensely helpful for some people. They could be shattered after being laughed at in their face by a friend who doesn’t believe them, or maybe someone gave them and their opposite sex lover dirty looks at pride. All that can be very damaging to our self-confidence. So having a place where we can at least assume we are all bisexual people (since it’s a bisexual community), and we are attracted to 2 or 2+ genders, where we can feel validated and like we aren’t crazy, is of paramount importance to many of us. Obviously our identity shouldn’t require the approval of others but let’s be realistic: having the belief and approval of others doesn’t hurt, and sometimes, people want it. And there isn’t anything wrong with that if it’s to a healthy/average degree. I want people to take me seriously: people I have come out to in the past, and people I will come out to in the future. There’s nothing wrong with seeking validation. It’s helpful sometimes, in the sense that it can help us feel less insecure about our identities and our feelings. That may not ring true for anybody but I suspect it rings true for many people. Part of community is to make everybody feel safe, to remind each other of our bond. These “self help” posts do that. You don’t know who needs them at any given time, and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with a little extra positivity/validation/assurance. 

Have a good day 😊."
bisexual,foqh9bm,t1_foq1766,1587993524.0,"“No bi people allowed in a straight relationship” if other queer people don’t like bisexuals, they should give us pride back. “The Mother of Pride” Brenda Howard was a bisexual woman. I mean, she came up with the idea of the week-long pride celebration and coordinated the first pride march in 1970. These things set the foundation of pride that we as bisexuals are often excluded from! Which besides being super hurtful, is super dumb—it shows you that for all the celebrating people do for pride, all the empty talk they exchange about stonewall, they don’t even know their own history at all! They don’t even know the history of the event they’re celebrating. It’s unbelievable when all it takes is a brief google search. 

Also you are definitely allowed to complain! We don’t have to compare issues, we all have our own issues (with different sexual orientations and just as individuals in general.) This probably won’t be of much help, but I think the younger generations are less biphobic, or at least becoming less biphobic with time. I’m a Gen Z and I don’t really date a lot (gonna be seventeen in June), but they only relationship I’ve ever had was with a lesbian (and I’m bisexual. Duh.) Obviously that’s one person but I think nowadays queer people really just want to find each other, they aren’t as suspicious of bisexuals because there are so many out now! We make up the majority of the community! SOMEBODY has to like the same and opposite gender for real, right? Of course, that’s why they identify as bi. And there are probably other reasons for this increase in acceptance among younger people, butttt I admit I haven’t studied that too critically yet lol."
sicily,foqfbfg,t1_foq2a80,1587992201.0,I would love to hear anything you have to say. Thank you for the information!
ptsd,foju52n,t1_fojq2zd,1587829442.0,"I know exactly what you mean (I keep saying that but it’s true.) It’s a long road ahead of us, but I know we can make it. I really hope there is something beyond all this and we can put this behind us so we are able to do all the things we deserve to be able to do: like have friends, have careers, fall in love, have kids and be able to take care of ourselves so we can take care of them."
ptsd,fojp868,t1_fojkwxv,1587826420.0,"I feel exactly the same way. My friends both online and from school haven’t reached out to me except a sentence a day, or for homework, or because they were talking about killing the sleeves. I do have one friend I talk to daily but we also have issues in our relationship, mostly because of my issues, but it’s complicated. I know it probably doesn’t mean much and sounds cheesy but I care about you too. I mean I know how much other kids can hurt each other. My situation was weird because it was like, my “friends” bullying me. And it was such a long time that it’s hard to imagine having a friendship without that kind of strife and anxiety, that back and forth crap. When one day I was randomly cast out, I lost my entire life. I lost my friends and the abuse and I never dealt with it until a year after. My life feels so empty now.

 I understand the damage kids can do, so to me, we have a lot in common and that brings us close. I hope you get out of the south. I’m from the Northeast, and I’m sure you’ll be able to find some better help here. I’m so sorry you feel forgotten. I know how that can drive someone crazy. I’m so sorry you had to go through this. If you want, feel free to talk to me. ♥️"
ptsd,fojjulv,t1_fojg954,1587822816.0,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I would recommend one on one for now. Groups can be a challenge, I have been in some, and mostly they have resulted in BSing a lot. Although they are sometimes very helpful, they’re not that effective for me personally overall in my opinion. I could be wrong but that’s how I feel. It’s also a possibility that maybe you just need to find the right group, or that you aren’t ready yet. 

I would really try to find a therapist who knows about PTSD. I’m tired of talk therapy, I don’t think talking about the same things over and over is gonna help me. What we need is TOOLS to help us deal with our trauma. Yes talking about it can be good and helpful but after a while it’s the same things over and over and a stranger just saying “wow” and “I’m sorry.” We need TOOLS to help us cope with our symptoms. We need TOOLS to help us stay motivated. We need TOOLS to learn how to form healthy relationships with people, TOOLS to grow our self-confidence...we need ACTION. My therapist is making me do exercise and eat healthy...not exactly gonna keep me from obsessing over my abuser. Helpful stuff, of course, but I don’t feel like my issues are being dealt with specifically. But that’s my fault too because I do have a lot of trouble talking about it, even if she does know quite a bit by now. 

But yeah, talking is over for me. I’ve been doing that since I was twelve, I’m gonna be seventeen in June. I need tools to help me survive the world: to help control my mood swings, to help me deal when hearing about bullying, to help me build self esteem, to help me cope with rejection better, to rely/cling less on/to my parents, to help me grow up (I’ve been stunted somewhat), and to help me learn how to have a proper friendship! 

I’m probably ranting at this point, but what I’m trying to say is, we have to work on being proactive. We can’t just stop working after a therapy session where all we did was meditate and talk and talk on and on about the same bad people. We need more than that because clearly, we are barely getting by... I mean, I haven’t gotten over having dolls for comfort and safety. I have literally slept multiple times this year, sometimes every night, in my parents bed, because I felt terrified at night. I don’t care what anyone says, that’s sick. And I’m tired of not getting any proper help. 

It sounds like you had a bad experience with therapy, but I promise you, there’s gotta be someone out there who can help you! I would look for someone who knows about ptsd and bullying, and perhaps even someone who specializes in young adults. I really hope that someday we can put these times behind us enough so that we are able to lead more fulfilling lives. I know that can be possible for us! Sorry again for ranting, I was trying to make a point here. I know it can feel embarrassing to talk about bullying when most people don’t understand how far it can go, how much it can hurt, but our pain is clearly grave and matters!!!! Don’t give up! I don’t know you but I know that you have a lot to offer this world and that it is possible for you to have a happy life. I really believe that. Sorry again for the length.♥️"
ptsd,fojfdu5,t1_fojewf4,1587819322.0,"I know exactly how you feel. People don’t understand that for us, even though the abuse is over, it has stayed with us and basically, it has ruined our lives. It has kept us from enjoying our youth, kept us from seeing a future where we can be proud of ourselves and have healthy/or even any relationships with other people... We will never get these years back, and they were destroyed in a place we were supposed to be focusing on learning about ourselves, improving ourselves, and feeling safe. Just like anyone else. But it seems like we can never be like anyone else. We missed out on basic things, like forming self-confidence, like forming ourselves, like having fun with friends...

...and then no one takes us seriously after all that. 

it’s just so amazing to me that anyone can belittle the utter horror of our lives being taken away...by someone who may not even think about us anymore? 

I’m so sorry about what happened to you. I really wish you the best. I hope you’re in therapy and are getting some help for your issues. I know it doesn’t seem like it helps, at least for me, but it’s something. You never know."

bisexual,fod26jl,t1_focl42i,1587678927.0,oh yeah that was another thought I had lmao! I feel ya buddy. I feel ya.
bisexual,focil22,t1_focdhno,1587671749.0,"yeah I understand what you mean. It’s complicated but goes something like this: bisexuals often have “preferences”, which have to do with who we are sexually attracted to more. For example, a bisexual may say they are 60% into boys and then 40% into girls. Although of course preference isn’t really the best term for it, because it’s not something they control really, but I guess people have food preferences too and that has to do with taste buds and blah blah blah I’m getting off track. 

But there’s a big difference between preferences and absolutely not enjoying/craving/ one gender t all, you know? Yeah there are a lot of memes about how many bisexual girls aren’t into guys at all, and they’re all “who needs them” and “all women are perfect I only like one man every super moon” blah blah blah, but don’t let that fool you: 

if they are actually bisexual, they like men. If you feel like you can fall in love with boys and girls, but are not interested in a physical relationship with a man, then you may be a biromantic homosexual. If that is the case, that means you do not desire physical relations with men because that’s not what you like, you know? That’s a big difference from liking both genders sexually and just tending to feel more interested in the other. Because as bisexuals, we like 2+ genders. And sometimes our preferences change, and there are some of us who are 90% one gender and 10% the other, even, but to be repulsed by one gender’s sexual organ sounds...not bisexual. I mean perhaps you could be asexual and biromantic, but if you think you are a lesbian, then it seems like you are sexually attracted to women. 

I would just go with the flow and see what happens for you. 

I know it can be confusing because if you do turn out to be biromantic homosexual, you may wonder what to call yourself. I have two ideas on this. On one hand, biromantic homosexual would be your proper label, and I always say you should be true to all the details of yourself. Romantic orientation labels are becoming more common nowadays, so I wouldn’t worry about it seeming long or extra. On the other hand, my suggestion would be to call yourself gay in that case anyway, because you can only have the “full classic package” (being sexually and romantically attracted to a person) with another woman, and while there are some people who marry asexuals (for example) and do not have sex, I think it will be super hard to love a man and not be able to have sex with him when he will be wanting to have sex with you (unless you find an asexual man.) Like I said, plenty of people make it work without sex in a loving relationship (for example: there are some asexual people who let their partners have partners to fulfill their sexual needs, but like I said, it depends on each case.) It’s possible that you could find Mr. Right and it make it work without sex being involved, but you have to remember that people still have needs, you know. But if you are very much open to finding Mr. Right, then I guess I would say to call yourself biromantic homosexual and make it clear that you are dick-repulsed. You could also decide that you have been thinking you are into men when you are really a lesbian, influenced by heteronormativity. 

Whatever the case is, I wish you the absolute best of luck.

Also, note: hopefully I made this clear but romantic orientation can be different from sexual orientation."
bisexual,focffx7,t3_g6ocfj,1587670701.0,were you just sitting there thinking or was the best friend like THERE and ready-
bisexual,focem0e,t3_g6nja9,1587670422.0,"Safety aside, even it they were ashamed and just didn’t want anybody to know, harassing them wouldn’t make it better/help anybody. Besides, it’s not up to anybody but the person in question how the person in question deals with their sexuality. And even if they’re ashamed or uncomfortable now, that doesn’t mean they have to be forever! But you can’t force it. Even if they’re safe to come out, they still might not feel ready or comfortable, and that’s ok too! 

In this world, we are allowed to make choices as well. There are some LGBT people who instead of living as themselves, would rather conform (example, gay men marrying women even though they know they aren’t attracted to them.) And while to us it’s sad, it’s also not our business. It’s their choice, as an adult. We can’t harass people because they don’t act or do as we want them to. Not every LGBT person will be interested in going to pride, not every LGBT person will put a flag on their wall or do stereotypically (insert however they identify) things. And it’s not fair to expect that of them. Even if there is some shame holding them back, forcing them and shaming them into doing things they aren’t comfortable with isn’t right. 

I personally am out to my parents and what few friends I have (lmao), but it isn’t something I would say I like to talk about loudly or discuss. Because that’s just not me. I’m conservative in the idea that I just don’t feel like talking about my relationships or sexual feelings to the world or in great detail to those around me, perhaps because I have trust issues (as I was not raised in a conservative household, so I don’t know what else to blame, except maybe shyness? Although I’m not shy really.) I don’t feel like people have to know I’m bisexual, and personally, don’t feel like it’s a big part of who I am. It has impacted my life greatly, yes, but I guess it’s just not something I think about a lot. Meanwhile there are some people who bring their flags to school and parade around, drawing their flags on their hands or in their notebooks, who go to the school’s Gay Straight Alliance, etc. I see nothing wrong with these things! I think they’re EXTREMELY important! But they’re also not me. Does that make me any less queer or any less proud than them? I say, no way. 

So making people come out with a cake and their flag draped around their shoulders when they’re not comfortable, or they don’t feel ready, or they aren’t sure they’re safe, or for whatever reason there is, is totally wrong. And making them ashamed of themselves for not doing what you think they’re supposed to do is super gross. Maybe by 2021 we can leave this behind us...?

They’re just not attracted to men. I think that stereotype is harmful and ridiculous.

bisexualadults,fns6705,t3_g3ik6m,1587213862.0,"Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble: 

As a bisexual, I actually understand the concern. I don’t have statistics but I would guess even though most bisexual people would prefer to live completely monogamously, I have been surprised lately to discover there are a lot of couples or partners with a bisexual person who frequently allow said bisexual person to experiment sexually with the other gender (usually the same gender because also due to statistics most bisexuals marry the opposite gender, and no offense, I feel like this would be an even more touchy subject if the other partner was homosexual. Lesbians and bisexual girls especially are often said to have issues with each other, although I hope this next generation is demolishing that.) So I do understand why you would be thinking about if he would be able to live without experimenting with dudes here and there, although from what I’ve seen it’s mostly bisexuals who have no experience with the same gender who want to do that...but ofc it’s probably not always that. Anyway what I’m trying to say is, I do understand the worry if that’s not something you can see yourself being comfortable with (even though it’s probably not as common as you would think...)

I can’t really give you any advice because I don’t know the guy. Everybody’s different. If he wants to be with you, you need to sit down with him and discuss your relationship and his bisexuality respectfully. Don’t accuse him of any stereotypes. Don’t ask him for his dating and sex resumé. Ask calmly things like: is he going to want other partners sexually? How often? Other than sex, will we be monogamous (I bet you this is a yes because sex is very different from romance.) Tell him you care about him, too. 

It really all depends on you and the guy. Almost nothing to do with his bisexuality...it’s just...having to do with what ideas you have for the relationship and if he can uphold them. Which as I said, most bisexuals are totally able to do monogamy completely like you would presume any mono-sexual couple could. Honestly though, I wouldn’t really worry about anything like that. I’d be more worried about getting together with him! You seem kind of insecure about the situation, being inexperienced as you are, which is ok! Take a chance! <3 Wishing you the best!!"

And if he did expect you to respond, well, that’s really just silly, no offense. As for responding to his death, many people react with shock and numbness to tragedies or similar scary or sad events. I want to believe you actually saw a ghost, but it just makes more sense to me—even as a believer in ghosts—that what you saw was a manifestation of your guilt or something. If he did come to you with a message or some kind that wasn’t anger—-well I don’t see why he was so aggressive about it, certainly that’s very scary. I’m just not sure.

Also, because of the title and NSFW. If it’s not about anorexia, I’m curious as to what ana is supposed to be then (a name?)

I’m a little confused by the part about, something like allowing someone to touch? (Feeling the edges because I permit you to)I’m just wondering what that means/what relevance that has?"
bisexual,fmfjvhv,t3_fuunl5,1586028776.0,"Ik there are a bunch of comments but I just wanna say I really needed this. I myself (female) have preferred girls my entire life, never “fell in love” with a dude, never noticed them that much, meanwhile I was girl crazy as a kid. I don’t have the opposite-sex-leaning-bisexual life story. But I still like men. I like to look at them a lot, actually. Know why? Because I’m fucking bi. So when other bisexual girls think preferring girls means we think men ain’t shit or that we “don’t need men” (because girls are so much better/ALWAYS better/more attractive), I get really pissed off because HELLO. We’re bisexual girls. We like men. DUH! Sometimes I wonder if they think preferring women makes them better queers or something. Whatever. You won’t catch me going around talking about how pure I am because I’ve never been with a dude...it’s stupid. 

And I see this ALL THE TIME with other bisexual women/girls. LEGITIMATELY. ALL THE TIME on social media. One girl on Instagram put “I’m bisexual which means I’m resentfully attracted to men and terrified of women.” ...??? Tf does it mean to be “resentfully attracted” to someone? If you’re mad at yourself for feeling attraction to a certain sex, that’s something you gotta deal with STAT. Sexual attraction and romantic attraction should be beautiful, nice-feeling things. 

Another post explains it well: bisexual girls focus on girls so they feel queer enough and people take their orientation seriously, and bisexual boys focus on girls because people think they’re gay. It’s sad they feel like (consciously or subconsciously) they have to police their attraction to men. For some bisexuals, they’re fighting the assumption they’re just straight. For me, I have to fight the assumption that I’m gay (my family assumes this because like I said, never really got attached to a boy.) But guess what? I’m also not drooling over every chick I see, and every chick I see isn’t necessarily better than every guy I see. That would just not make sense at all, and it’s weird as hell when I’m like expected to be uncontrollably lustful for every woman because of Tik Tok or whatever. My heart/body/whatever “picks and chooses” as much as a straight person’s does. Yeah, I do check random girls out a lot, but it’s just a thing I do. Doesn’t mean she’s like automatically a goddess or like lightning’s going through me or something every girl I see. How would I get through my day? And what am I, twelve?! And this is coming from an infamous horn-dog by the way, guys. So. 

I mean I’m glad they feel they have a place to express themselves but it’s still a little worrying. I just think people need to chill out. This wouldn’t bother me if I didn’t feel like it was 1) internalized biphobia on the part of these bi girls honestly (they want to be mono-sexual (homosexual) to be “fully queer” 2) the usual “all guys are stupid” thing (that has made straight girls try to date women; so yeah this idea or whatever is powerful) (and as someone who was bullied by girls constantly for most of her life, as well as s*xually assaulted by a woman, I take great offense to the ‘guys are evil women are always good’ deal) and them just not wanting to deal with boys and 3) the need to over-perform same-sex attraction to be taken seriously. 

So anyway like I was saying, I get the pressure of mono-sexuality and it sucks, but bisexual girls going around complaining about having to be attracted to guys is sooooooooo annoying to me! It paints an inaccurate and confusing portrait of bisexuality. We’re not half gay or straight, just fully bi, so why does it matter “where we lean” so much? I just wanna yell “just accept it ladies!! you aren’t lesbians!!!” but I know the duality and bi-cycle of bisexuality can be really confusing and as humans many of us want balance and organization in our lives....and since being queer is such a big part of most of our identities (tbh idk how much it is of mine, i don’t really do a lot like go to pride or GSA or anything yet) liking men as bisexual girls can make us feel less queer. But queer doesn’t mean exclusively homosexual. We are always queer because we are bisexuals. And we are definitely allowed to have pride because the “Mother of Pride” was bisexual herself!! 

Preferences don’t even matter tho, guys. 60% one gender, 40% another...if you go on Quora (for example) you’ll see plenty of bisexual girls who prefer girls end up marrying men even tho they’re like 90% girls 10% dudes or whatever. Because in the end, we’re bisexual, and for a good portion of people in the world (I’d say), we’re focused on finding love with the right person/personality. Splitting ourselves up based on who we get attracted to more, who we date more, is just so unnecessary to me. Because in the end it’s about personality, and we’re bisexual. We like 2+ genders. Yup. Doesn’t matter who we “prefer”, if anybody. We’re all bisexual in the end."
bisexual,fm0lvqs,t3_fs9yh0,1585661156.0,"Reminds me of when I first came out. Both my parents are liberal people, but mom was always kind of frustrated by it. She even said some nasty things, actually. 

It’s no excuse, but I think if they’re generally accepting of queer things, they just need to get over the shock that it’s their kid now. Especially for when it’s your parent of the same gender. They probably had all these ideas they’d be able to relate to you on opposite gender stuff—mom and daughter with birth control, seeing cute guys in the movie together, etc. And because of bisexuality, that’s still possible: but now there’s also the chance that girls may catch you eye, as one has now. And that wasn’t part of their Plan, you know? Not only that, parents want as easy a life as possible for their kids. Being queer has gotten a lot easier, but it’s still no walk in the park, especially to parents who may not be aware of how much representation the community has started to get. They may still be living back to when they were growing up, and then they start getting all fearful for you. 

I’m not gonna say my mom’s comments—from dismissing my questioning me sexuality, to calling me gross and even taunting me (12-14 age range!! I don’t talk about it anymore) hasn’t left scars. I may not have been kicked out or abused, thank God, but I have severe internalized homophobia (hating myself for liking the same gender) and internalized biphobia (hating myself for liking both.) It might not be all my mom’s fault, but I’ve never faced any intolerance in my life, except hearing stuff on the news and in the world I guess. You know all that stuff people post on queer TIK Tok? I can’t stand it, you know? The flags, the openness these people have. I just wish I could never hear about the LGBT+ community again. It makes me so angry. But here I am, in this Reddit community, trying to break the walls of disgust down. 

So yeah, parents can make these things even tougher than they already are! But I also know that things are going to get better. Because my mom ISN’T homophobic. I know that might sound weird for me to say after what I’ve discussed, but it’s true. She loves me as I am, and has told me so. It’s just that the news was very shocking to her, and as an older straight woman, she can’t wrap her head around why on earth a girl would like another girl. And I get that. “It never impacts you until it’s you.”

I think your mom will come around too. If not, it’s gonna be a rude awakening for her as you continue to be bisexual. And in the future, she might even feel sorry for how she acted about your crush. 

Even if she doesn’t come around, don’t forget that you’re valid. If you need to talk to someone, there are loads of people on Reddit and other platforms!!! ♥️ stay safe"
bisexual,flvxo8x,t3_fr5fdw,1585534576.0,"A Dumb Lesbian: We need to protect our LGBT community, guys! #pride !!!!!!!!!

Also Dumb Lesbian: Wants COVID-19 to wipe out most of the community.

I get it’s a joke, but still. Jokes hold power, they have messages. 

When will they understand? Without bisexuals and bisexual+ people, that is a serious thinning of the herd. The community and its history would be totally different. But then again, I guess that’s what they want, even though bisexuals have played a big part in helping gain acceptance for the community. ugggggh. People like this are why I still have so much internalized biphobia. it’s so depressing and the tension, the self-hated, god it’s all just ruining my life. being bisexual is anxiety-inducing enough because of the “bi-cycle” without being told what we go through is in our heads and nothing serious. the threat of waking up and suddenly realizing I have been confused all along terrifies someone with severe obsessive anxiety like myself. when I was a kid and didn’t see this kind of crap, i worked hard to be proud of who I was. now im older and wiser and i feel like all my hard work has come undone and I’m back to square one it’s like being a kid all over again. it’s like the day i started having my first crush (I never really have crushes on the opposite gender, but I’m still attracted to them), it’s like the day when I was twelve I got so guilty sitting in the church pews that I walked out and never went back. because a lot of christians don’t like us, too. we don’t always get off scot free because we like the opposite gender, too, tho I realize for some people it can be privilege (like being mono-sexual is, when it comes to being accepted by the world at large (straight) and the LGBT community (homosexuals) but god, why don’t they see that even though our experiences are very different, we have too much in common to be at odds? 

maybe im just overreacting...or maybe not. I guess I needed to get this out. Sorry.

Anyway. End biphobia: stop ruining lives."

bisexual,fkzo3cn,t3_fllh50,1584675691.0,"Hey, so it def sounds like you’re bi. It’s common for bisexual people to lean more to one gender over others, so I wouldn’t worry. Although I will say, I wonder if your discomfort around men perhaps could be nervousness? Personally I’m bi and all my friends have always nearly exclusively been female. So I’m not used to being around boys, so I imagine it would be like “tf am I supposed to do with this” kind of. Idk how to explain it. What I’m saying is, it could be awkwardness from not being used to them because you have more friends who are girls, or it could even be attraction making you feel funny. I think you said that you are female like me so if you are, well, might be something to consider. 

Then again, it could be just like you say, that you’re very picky when it comes to boys. I know a lot of bisexual girls who are. It doesn’t make you less bisexual or more bisexual. Like some people seem to think when you’re bi and “prefer” the same gender, it means you’re a better lgbt+ member than bisexuals who are 50/50 or bisexuals who “prefer” the opposite or other genders. And there’s girls who are like “who needs boys all girls are perfect!” which is so annoying because they’re bisexual, not lesbian? And it just confuses me lol (is that too harsh?) Just live life, don’t worry about what you prefer, which gender you like better, etc. You don’t have to prefer any gender, if that’s how it turns out. There’s no right way to be bisexual except...If you typically and consistently find men attractive, and you find women attractive, you’re bisexual, or something else like pansexual. No matter if you lean more towards one way then the other. And “preferences” can also change over time. There are even bisexual women who prefer women but end up marrying a man because that’s just who they wound up falling in love with. “Preferences” don’t matter, although they can be confusing. 

Try not to worry about uncertainty. Everything will become clear with time, and it sounds like it might already be crystal clear for you. Sorry this was long, it’s just, I understand where you’re coming from. Growing up I was basically a lesbian (although obviously now I know I’m bi), but because I learned I like boys too, even tho I have strongly preferred women all my life, I’m still bi because the attraction to men is still there, even if it’s typically much smaller. I don’t have a type, but well, that also doesn’t matter! Stay cool :)."

PCOS is not something you just randomly get, although mostly women found out they have it during their 20s and 30s, a lot of people also have it from puberty. I’m pretty sure it’s just something in your DNA (ofc I’m not a doctor so I don’t know explicit details but that’s the general consensus, that it’s because of inherent hormone imbalanced. She’s have to be hexed from birth, but PCOS isn’t a horrible illness, it’s burdensome for the individual sometimes, but it is common and women manage well with medicine!!!) Not only that, it can be pretty obvious that PCOS was always there-again it doesn’t just pop up, it’s just not always diagnosed-symptoms can be apparent from puberty such as very irregular periods, excess hair, excess acne, deep voice, mood swings, etc. it’s different for everybody but I don’t think PCOS is a result of your friend being hexed. I have all these symptoms and it doesn’t regularly impact my life, I just need to start medicine so I can menstruate normally. That’s all. No biggie. No hex. I don’t intend to birth children, so possible pregnancy issues don’t matter to me, and even then, many women with PCOS overcome that challenge. Mood swings can also be handled with medication. So don’t let your friend fret too much :))

I haven’t done many reversal spells before but when I did do one recently I read somewhere that you could cancel out a spell by doing the opposite of what you did with the ingredients in the original, and adding a new chant. If fire was used, used water, for example. Ofc there are also a million methods you could probably find online, too. Also if she didn’t call on any entities, I don’t see how she could have summoned a negative entity into her life...it’s true that most people recommend casting circles for protection before spell-work, but when I begun in middle school I never cast circles and was fine, so it’s all up to the practitioner. And I wasn’t calling on anybody. Honestly I would just do research about reversals and tailor it to the spell that was used-I just read she doesn’t remember the specifics. So I would just come up with an entirely new spell. Sorry about that."

I’m gonna go card by card, and I’m doing Greek names/mythology: 

The Devil Reversed Had Me Thinking of: Ares (reassuring control), Zeus or any of his siblings (i used a site called Tarot Guide and Devil reverse talks a lot about freedom and reclaiming power, which makes me think of their origins story.) 

Four of Swords Reversed Had Me Thinking of: Zeus or any of his siblings (such as Demeter) who were raised in isolation; everyone but Zeus having been swallowed by Cronos, too. Really wasn’t sure about this one!!! 

Seven of Wands Had Me Thinking of: Ares (fighting), Zeus (holding your own, busy) 

Ace of Pentacles Had me Thinking of: Plutus (god of wealth), Apollo (I feel like he’s god of everything good lol), Demeter (abundance, but harvest abundance?)

The Hermit Had Me Thinking of: Athena (lot of self reflection stuff? Because she’s brainy? Idk.) Zeus (idk why.) Maybe any goddess or god who’s more of a loner, or maybe one of the Virgin goddesses because they don’t sleep/engage with men (so they’re like by themselves) Maybe Hades because he’s alone away from Olympus where most of the other gods are? Also maybe Odin, because it’s supposed to be like, during isolation, you gain self reflection and knowledge and wisdom? And he represents wisdom.

Srry if this wasn’t much help!! Like I said I’m still new to this but I wanted to offer something up lol!
