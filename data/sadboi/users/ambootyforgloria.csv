I never wanted these things in the past but you have to come to terms & accept the fact that you’re growing up.

offmychest,ev48v5d,t3_ci76ge,1564209735.0,"that’s exactly how i felt with my own lil shih tzu, Ollie. he also coincidentally had to get hernia surgery when he was a puppy, but that was a mild & easy going surgery, i’m sure you have nothing to worry about. 
before i got him, i always wanted a big dog. i loved shiba inu’s specifically, and i always dreamt about having one when i moved out. 

for my birthday, my mom took me to amish country for a surprise. she didn’t tell me, but i had a small idea of what the surprise would be; a dog like i always asked for. we pulled into an amish man’s driveway and there were a pin of puppies. we were supposed to get Ollie’s brother, Timmy, but the man told us he suspiciously “disappeared”. which was odd. we didn’t take that red flag tho. we brought my ollie home & he wasn’t playful as a normal puppy. he would stick in his little corner in the back of my living room. we assumed that he was just shy and needed to adjust to the new home. 

but as days went by, he just grew more & more lethargic & sick. i didn’t have him for a whole week by the time we discovered he had parvo, a very common virus among puppy mills. (not saying that the only dogs to get parvo were from puppy mills) we had strong evidence that we bought ollie from a puppy mill, we didn’t discover until we started suspecting he was sick. we actually looked up the last name of the guy we bought him from & he had gotten in trouble with related incidents. 
i remember having to drive ollie back to the man’s farm, hoping he could get him to the vet before it was too late. but halfway there, we got a call from him stating that Ollie’s brothers and sisters all had to be put down, and he would most likely have the same fate. 

i remember crying and sobbing in the car, holding my almost lifeless puppy. he was so small and soft and i regretted all those second thoughts i had, all the times i said i’d prefer a bigger dog. 

luckily, ollie survived it. he had a strict diet of raw egg & electrolytes. i remember picking him up the second time from the man’s house. he came running to me. 

dogs are truly the coolest things & i wouldn’t trade mine for the world."
