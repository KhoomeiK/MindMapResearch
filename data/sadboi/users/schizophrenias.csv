schizophrenia,fizg7hd,t3_faivfk,1582861998.0,"Looking at your post history it seems it’s only been 11 days and you went from saying your sister is a good person to this. A quick decline into resentment, I understand you deserve attention too that she is affecting you and your girlfriend.

However she has a chronic illness she can’t escape. You can escape by either leaving the living situation or going to therapy yourself working through your feelings and finding ways to cope with living with someone with chronic illness.

Maybe it’s just me but coming to a schizophrenic sub which is often meant for support to rag on your sister about how horrible she is, isn’t a kind thing, to your sister or to other people with schizophrenia. I would say maybe rephrase your questions next time rather than making it out like she’s horrible."

schizophrenia,faj5gh7,t3_e9b4qm,1576125029.0,I don’t know too much about it but there’s an organization called Students with Schizophrenia. It was founded and is run by Cecilia McGough a young woman with schizophrenia who did a  TED talk on schizophrenia and is a mental health advocate. I’m pretty sure the organization is run by schizophrenic students across the US and they help other schizophrenic college students. Again I don’t know much about it but might be worth looking into or at least learning about.

DID,f9g4zlo,t1_f9g3gxj,1575293421.0,"I have no access to family medical history due to my adoption. And have suffered and been treated for psychosis since age 12. Wasn’t diagnosed until 18 for schizoaffective Because of the extremely rarity of children having early onset psychosis/schizophrenia. Recently this year my diagnosis is changed to Paranoid Schizophrenia/Just regular ol’ Schizophrenia which honestly affects my life much more drastically and brings so much pain but my alters and dissociation and trauma history seem to be an ever present problem too.

I have a appointment with a new psych provider on Friday since my last one was very bad and made too many mistakes. I’m just so confused lately and Idk what’s real and what illness is affecting me which makes it more confusing. Sometimes I can’t tell anymore between alter voices and auditory hallucinations and I’m so ahhhh. I’m really messed up.

I hope I didn’t bother you or stray too far from DID topic. I’m just trying to figure out if I actually have DID. Cause I worry it’s a big delusion created by my brains schizophrenia."

schizophrenia,f81t6k3,t3_dylewe,1574176776.0,"I feel you. I used to be super religious and am trying to hang on to it still even though I’m pretty sure it’s very unhealthy for me. I recently became agnostic and it seems I’ll most likely be an atheist. I’ve accepted this, because I think experiencing human life and emotion is more important than chasing after religious grandiosity and ecstasy. I still get confused though because my dreams have lots of rich spirit symbolism which makes me think Gods are sending me messages and warring with eachother over who gets to claim me."

schizophrenia,f81368w,t1_f812sig,1574147929.0,"Can you dissect the how schizophrenia is related to everything I’m saying. I personally find psychology interesting and helps me understand my illness.

I do take medication and am getting new psychiatrist/nurse cause my current nurse tried to give me two meds with dangerous interaction and also messed up my prescription so I couldn’t get it til my dad saved me by calling insurance company. The meds don’t work I feel like none have for long term I’ve taken about 10 different ones.

I’m afraid I’ll get fat apathetic And lose sex drive on a powerful med like invega or clozapine and my boyfriend won’t be able to cope what meds and my illness turned me into.

I don’t want to go to psych ward cause I went when I was 12 and it was extremely scary I’m trying to wait it out til I get a new psych provider!! It’s a long distance relationship so he can’t be there but I see new psych in 3-4 weeks I think??

Thanks for advice and love and support. hugs."

I hope I’m not being drugged by government I’ve stayed up til 2AM now tonight and they haven’t come. 

Im afraid to ask psychiatrist for help cause I don’t want more meds cause I’ll get fat and apathetic and lose my sex drive and my boyfriend will leave me cause he’ll not be able to cope with what I turn into."

schizophrenia,f81069q,t3_dyb9fn,1574144277.0,"I studied Buddhism for a long time. It helped me be kind to everyone including animals, but made me scared of being reborn as animal for bad things I’ve done and eating them still.

I used to meditate hours at a time but now I don’t do it at all cause I’m lazy and have a hard time with apathy but it’s very easy for me to enter meditative state.

I see meditation as like watching clouds go by u see the clouds acknowledge them and let them go by. The clouds are not the sky which is your true open clear mind they are simply in it passing by and not to be held on to and attached to.  This helps me accept bad things cause they are just clouds when I know my true self is open and clear.

I don’t practice much besides being kind, even tho I eat meat. I just can’t do it cause I don’t grasp Buddha’s teachings well anymore let alone Jesus teachings either. Very different teachers but core value of love so I try to love since many teachers live and taught this way. I hope at least I’ll be reborn as higher being or human again because for Buddhists human is best life for balance of suffering and goodness this way to get enlightened for exiting samsara.

It helps but I cognitively can’t practice as well as I used to.

I hope if u look into it u find comfort in it for the teachings of Buddha are very good. Don’t follow blindly tho Buddha said to test for ourselves if it works not to follow through blind faith."
schizophrenia,f80zosp,t3_dybyyr,1574143732.0,"I experience this. I love shopping and retail therapy, so I often go to the mall if I have money and even if I just walk around and window shop it’s nice. I get really paranoid cause everyone around me knows I have schizophrenia from my body language they ignore it but they know, and they think I’m weird.  

I usually get pretty bad within an hour and a half and have to find a quiet place. If you go to mall or big store often identify bathroom or quiet place, and also set a time limit within ur range so u can leave before too upsetting but ur not alone."
