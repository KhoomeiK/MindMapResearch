On the normal ocean fishing (gladion, rhotano, northern, southern), you need to catch Spectral Fish (using the special OCean Fishing baits) to spawn Spectral Currents. The Intuition Buff is purely to help you catch the 'rare' fish (which is NOT a spectral fish).

Once the Spectral Current (rainbow time) is active, you can get another type of Intuition buff, which is Required in order to catch the blue quality fish.

I understand that in your specific situation, you wouldn't know about these things happening either, but that doesn't absolve you of responsibility.

You will have to pay to fix this / claim on your insurance.

Scenario 2: You own a house and put it up for sale. The buyers are found, you move out and await the exchange. The exchange happens and the new buyers are now 'tied in' so to speak. The house catches on fire and burns to the ground. You have to inform the buyer that your house is now burnt rubble, and the buyer will have to claim on their insurance and implement the repairs.

Scenario 3: You own a house and put it up for sale. The buyers are found, you move out and await the exchange. The exchange happens and completion happens. The new owners later discover damage that may have been caused back when you were the owner. This is no longer your responsibility as the buyers should have been thorough with their checks pre-purchase.  


edit: it looks like you are worried about scenario 1 but where the buyers are not informed of a change of status to the property and exchange/complete on false pretenses. If you don't disclose damage to the property then the contract could get recinded or you may get sued.

The unfortunate reality is that BPD doesn't really have a cure-all option. The sheer range of medications available and therapies you get made to try, sounds similar to what you are already going through. 
Some people get put on anti-depressants, anti-anxiety, mood stabilisers; some people have CBT, DBT, the 20 steppes program, talking therapy, counselling.

I don't know how debilitating your fibromyalgia is, but if part of your suicidal feelings is linked to the every day pain you get from that, then that's also a physical health route you can go down (not that there is much medical support available for that either).

For the time being, suicide prevention hotlines and your crisis numbers might be the best bet. Longer term, you need to get to the route of why you want to die. You can try online self-help and guidance and see if any of that helps.
When you next go see a GP it might be worth going in with a list of bullet points of your symptoms and an advocate (your mum) to help keep things on track. It may also help identify alternative treatment options when there's a clearer idea of exactly what is happening and how it is impacting you.
If you don't think your anti-depressants are working (sertraline is known to be more effective as an anti-anxiety according to recent reports), then request different ones. 
With regards to self harm, there are a few harmless methods to feel like you are doing harm that you could try, so reduce instances of you actually damaging yourself."

My very first character (a lalafel on zodiark), I played very messily, didnt pay attention to story parts, skipped content that then felt like a chore to go back to. I was also horrific at making gil.

  
My second character, also made on zodiark, was a miqo. I made a point of doing everything in level order (as in, get EVERYTHING to level 10, then 15, then 20, 30 and so on). I made many gil, worked through the story veeeeery slowly, and it was sometimes nice being on a character without having to talk to FC people.  


My third character was made when the Omega server opened. I re-made my lalafel and tried to play her properly like i did with my miqo, but I was mostly in it for the gil and free game time. Ultimately, I moved character #2 over to Omega as well, made my own personal FC and started hoarding gil, using toon #3 to fund character #2s crafting when i was lazy. I also turned character #3 in to a miqo version of my #1 lalafel (matching name included).

My fourth character was was made when the Spriggan server opened. I had vague hopes of another million gil (but alas). I then joined an FC on this character, got attached and moved my #1 lala over from zodiark.

BPD,fbhoir4,t1_fbhlpqv,1576878592.0,"Last I checked (5 seconds ago to make sure it didnt mess up the word choice), the word 'claiming' does not imply lying. It implies a lack of proof to backup the statement, but that's not the same as lying.

 The OP could very well be suicidal, but I stand by what i said originally: the word suicide is not a magic code word that lets you bypass established procedures. A GP shouldn't even be able to give a diagnosis, that is the job of a psychiatrist/equally specialised professional. 
 GPS where I live tend to throw antidepressants at eveything mental health related and only escalate in what *they personally* deem an emergency situation.

 If OP isn't feeling like they are being taken seriously by the GP/the the GP doesn't care/etc etc, then maybe try changing the approach. 
 Has OP explained their suicidal thoughts to the doctor, has the OP admitted they have an action plan (in my example the GP pried info about my plan out of me and asked whether I had the items required to implement my plan already)? 
Can OPs mum be more of an advocate to help keep the discussion level-headed and constructive (which is difficult for someone going through a crisis). In the OPs post, her mum only got involved after she was rebuffed.
Can OP not just outright ask to be referred to a psychiatrist/be referred for assessment?

And even with changing an approach, if/when OP finally gets the help they need, don't dismiss it if it turns out not to be a BPD diagnosis. That's a very specific thing to be chasing. I don't know if thats a cultural difference (i'm in the UK) but patients telling a doctor what their diagnosis should be on this side of the pond can put their backs up. 
The main focus should not be the diagnosis, but the getting something in place to de-escalate the feelings of suicide."
BPD,fbhlgg1,t1_fbhkn96,1576876482.0,"Yes because thats 100% what I said.

GPs are people. People have biases. A loud and abrasive suicidal person, as real as their situation may be, does not necessarily come across as someone who is about to end it in the eyes of some people. Especially in a situation were BPD, a condition steeped in stigma around manipulativeness and attention seeking, is concerned.

The point I was trying to make is:
1) this may not be the right approach
2) don't be so certain that is the right diagnosis for you
3) as evidenced in my own siutation, even in an emergecy things do not happen with a snap of the fingers. I have a friend currently going through a very tough time, is also passively suicidal and she is on a 4 month waiting list.

Finally, this is a BPD support sub. It is not a 'help me get diagnosed' sub."
BPD,fbhgi2f,t3_ede1t5,1576873098.0,"This is going to sound horrible but just saying ""i'm suicidal"" isn't a magic codeword that instantly lets you surpass the system and get seen.  
When I was diagnosed it was after an episode where I became catatonic. My parter was super worried about me, called my mum who managed to do a 40minutes drive in 20 to get to me, who forced through an emergency appointment with a GP. I recall the GP asking me about suicide and me telling him that it wasn't that i wanted to kill myself, I just didnt want to exist. He asked me if I had a plan, and a suicide plan came spilling out of my mouth. I didn't even realise I had a plan until i was saying it. The GP then assured me that my plan would not have worked, but would have caused me a lot of damage and pain, and he arranged for me to be seen by a psychiatrist asap (which was still several weeks wait). In the interim I was drugged up to my eyeballs on antidepressants and constantly under watch.  


Until I was diagnosed with 'emotionally unstable personality disorder' I convinced i just had depression.

In my experience, charging in with fanfare with your mind made up on what your diagnosis is and claiming suicidalness when things arent going your way probably isnt going to make a GP genuinely believe that suicide is a likely event.

CasualUK,f8cekhg,t3_e03v79,1574458586.0,I think they've done a really good job with it. It feels british without it being the ott stereotypes you get that only people outside of the UK seem to believe.
BPD,f7zkqry,t3_dy6vjt,1574112147.0,"This looks like it could be really helpful. i have tried keeping a written diary in the past but I would end up only writing in it during specific events, or everything would come out jumbled and i'd have a hard time making patterns. It was also a lot of hassle and I'd give up after a month or so. This looks much more intuitive and easy to keep track.  
I also have a friend that keeps a an electronic record of how she feels out of 10 on any given day, but she doesnt write down why she feels that way, so I think this would help her too.  


With BPD, emotions can quickly get very complicated, for example being happy isn't always a good thing (there have been times where I have been happy to the point of mania and I feel like i'm out of control), so an app that lets you input the variables seperate to the judgement of how you're feeling out of 10 would be very helpful."

Maybe its an issue thats come up in the past in their group that's been rugswept because its not something that affects women and they are saying that actually it does.

Afterall, the college has stats to make. It doesn't have to be a glowing reference, but she won't be without one.  
If she's after a glowing reference then she needs to earn it."

If she had a problem, she should have spoken to you about it.  


Unless there is some known etiquette in your friendship group that you can't buy the same clothes or clothes that anyone else likes then I see no reason why it would be an issue. I appreciate thet your friend may be insecure about her weight, but she shouldn't be projecting that onto you.

I have quite the dress collection and i'm alswys showing them to my friends and encouraging them to buy the same or similar. Sometimes they don't have it in my friends size, or sometimes they don't have it in my size but do have it in my friends size. Sharing is caring."

Being called weird isn't a cue to try and be and random and different as possible. If someone is calling you weird it's because you have a difference of opinion or you're doing something that doesn't make sense to them or you have abnormal social etiquette. Either agree, agree to disagree or ask them to elaborate so you can explain."

I get that it's a different country but that seems such a bizarre practice to me. Here in England you get asked if you even want your receipt (It's a paper saving method), so the idea of someone demanding to see said receipt as I leave the store as a routine thing just sounds crazy. If you want proof of purchase, look at the transaction history on the self-checkout machine; don't waste my time unless I've set the detectors off."
