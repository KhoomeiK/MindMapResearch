unpopularopinion,fn9mnmv,t3_g0hda7,1586778587.0,"I only disagree with one thing here. As a dancer I need to say that dancing and cheerleading could not be more different. Sure most competitive cheer routines have a dance break, but overall they require SO MUCH more athletic ability than dancing. More athletic ability than some of ‚Äúsports‚Äù you probably do enjoy. Now everything else you said? Sure. But the amount of strength, agility, and energy that cheerleaders have is insane. Cheerleading is NOT dancing, and IS a sport."
