inuyasha,fq6zoxf,t1_fq6paa8,1589139907.0,This honestly makes a lot more sense when you put it that way!
inuyasha,fq6yzb5,t1_fq6weof,1589139643.0,Oooh! This makes more sense! I kinda wish that towa had dog ears! It’d make her desire to be a regular human girl a little harder to do/ her life in the modern world interesting!

Lolita,f6f7fdb,t1_f6eo19n,1572811316.0,Thank you! And I will look for any merchandise and post it here if I find some 🤣
Lolita,f6elq0q,t1_f6el75g,1572805595.0,The point is: who’s making them? Are they still making them? Do they have an archive of multiple versions of these? And most importantly: do they got merchandise of this gold?

I've been working hard to remember that bad days are just days that are bad, and sometimes coming on here and hearing it from someone who is probably going through the same thing, feels good."
depression,expsxu1,t1_exps5du,1566494018.0,"Thank you! 

I guess I just don’t want to pester this person into isolating themself, like, they don’t even want to hang out because they feel almost reminded that they have a problem. I don’t even think they really know what they want honestly. But I know I want to be there for them. I hope it’s enough."

evolution,erm59vy,t1_erm4mba,1561006637.0,"THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE!
Okay, so would you say consent a byproduct of rape?

My take is that We have evolved by creating both sperm and egg donation/surrogate organizations, additionally, fostering and adoption spans through all organisms that have the maternal and paternal instinct to care and nurture for something that they do not inherently view as prey or predator. However, understanding that adoption doesn’t result in the reproduction and continuation for certain species. We as humans, don’t the passing of our own particular genes to continue the human race. Now the real curiosity and the inspiration for doomsday media such as “Snow Piercer”, “Handmaiden’s tale”, and “Children of Men” is: what happens if women there is no women or widespread female infertility and no sperm or egg banks left?

Also YES EDUCATING PEOPLE AND SPREADING AWARENESS IS SO IMPORTANT!

I find conversations at college like this to be interesting but more importantly provocative - I wish I was having that conversation in person, but it’s an online class. So I wondered if the interaction and responses in class would be any different on a forum such as this."
evolution,erlka1n,t1_erlk7o0,1560989451.0,I have not yet! Thank you for suggesting it :)
evolution,erljqic,t1_erlj6nq,1560989025.0,"Could you go into detail for consent in regards to philosophy and why such things could not be applied to other animals, despite us being the ""fifth ape"". What divides us most on this subject?"

Also currently watching this video for class, and trying to understand what kinds of human aspects should we compare/shouldn't compare and why. What animals are cognitively able to mimic our constructs and what can't and why?"
evolution,erlismz,t1_erlijpv,1560988302.0,You’re right - so I got this prompt as a forum question and am curious to see other people’s opinions and views on the subject. So what divides us between humans and animals in terms of rape? Would you say consent is a evolutionary byproduct of the human species?
