I ended up fashioning a tool out of wire with some sticky tape on the end that I could push through this slots and bump up the thermometer a degree or two whenever I had the opportunity.

By the time you're at 8-9 weeks with the patch, you're fairly used to not having that first smoke of the day, and all of the other daily smokes!

What surprised me the most is that I can actually live without smoking. I grew up with grandparents and parents that smoked. I was a very addicted smoker. I truly thought I would die a smoker. The process this time was tough, but not unbearable (except for a few times). Also, I had very little true support, even from my husband (because I had tried and failed in the past). If you have a solid support system, I imagine it would be even easier. The biggest gift is no longer being tied to the addiction. Dinner with friends runs late? No problem. Flight canceled? Not an issue. 

Since I'm married and have a joint account, I'm not keeping my savings seperate, it's just in with the rest of our money that will go towards our shared goals (like buying a home w/ 20% down).
