I think you’re going to be quite popular and legendary when you return to school. You have ascended the social food chain! Now gather your school mates and comprise a list of incidents involving this teacher. Read the pertinent sections of your student handbook for arguing points, so you’re prepared incase you and your Dad are called in for a chat. Tell your Dad thank you for raising such an awesome son! I feel so bad for that poor child. He will never forget this so hopefully something good can come of this."
