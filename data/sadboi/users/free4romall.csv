You’ll never get closure from narcissists so don’t expect it. Instead get a lot of therapy, practice extreme self-care and get support groups. 
If you’re currently in a narc relationship and can’t get out at this minute for whatever reason, you need to plan. 
The goal is the leave safely. Do not show the narc any signs of self-improvement. If you’re getting therapy, always make it about “oh I spoke of childhood trauma” if they ask. If you’re practicing a healthier lifestyle say that it helps your depression and anxiety. Trust me, if they see you putting yourself first they will freak out on you and the abuse gets worse.

Then the minute they realize you’re catching on, they freak out. That’s probably when they let their eyes wander for new prey. It’s not anything about how much they think the other person is wonderful, attractive, or a catch, etc. It has EVERYTHING to do with “hmm can this person be completely fooled so I can control the relationship to what I want it to be?”.

Honestly I think covert narcs are far more sinister than overt narcs. Overt narcs are apparent like a screaming toddler while coverts are fuckin’ vipers.
It’s like now I need to play dumb and act like I’m unaware of his behavior while getting my mind mentally prepared to get the hell outta here. 
Right now I’m having the hardest time trying to understand WHY he lied and hid the relationship he has with his coworker. 
Nothing is screaming it’s sexual and/or romantic. Trust me- I am not in denial nor defending or making excuses for him. I sometimes wish the nature of the relationship is sexual &/or romantic cause all this shit would make more sense. But I’ve found nothing. So even if it’s purely platonic, I still cannot understand WHY he lied, hid information, deflected, gaslighted, went through all that shit if there’s simply nothing there.
But there is- what I think? She is a platonic supply yet if it’s revealed that he had her around I would inevitably question here and there. And that would mean getting closer and closer to the true reason as to why he has her around.

They WANT you to do poor or at least not as well as they do because they need to feel in control over you. Because if you’re dependent on them, to them it means you won’t leave them. 
They will both belittle your aspirations saying things like “oh that’s really hard”, “you’re gonna meet so many horrible people if you do that”.

1. Make you feel inferior so they feel dominant
2. Mask the notion that they actually don’t want you to improve upon these flaws

They’re afraid pretty soon you’ll believe all that, realize what an idiot the narc is and leave. But if others tell you how gorgeous you are- that is a major ego stroke for the narc. It’s like complimenting an extension of themself. The narc will never leave you because in their mind they have assigned you as their perfect, ideal partner. Of course they will still get extra supply elsewhere depending on if they cheat or not but even if it’s completely platonic they may not admit to the REASON why they have hidden people on the sidelines.

Then when I agree they back up. Like wtf? What’s it gonna be? Then the next day it’s as if nothing happened."
abusiverelationships,foe0hmq,t1_fodp2u4,1587693636.0,I’m so sorry. I’m here if you need someone to talk to...
abusiverelationships,fo8i13p,t1_fo8f2kf,1587596949.0,Does she also say things that make you question your importance to her?
NarcissisticAbuse,fo88eao,t1_fo887jt,1587591764.0,I shouldn’t but it’s so sad I am laughing right now. It’s a shame a lot of people live this way.
NarcissisticAbuse,fo87sef,t1_fo86ezn,1587591444.0,"So she left because she realized you knew exactly what she was doing? I had a textbook narc ex before this covert one. I knew exactly what he was doing and let him know. He did not budge. Threats to leave. Purposely leaving his dating profile out in the open trying to make me think he’s on his way out. Nothing. They don’t ever want to leave or even think about it until they realize you know they’re abusive. Which at first they will gaslight you some more to undo your discovery of their narc ways. If that fails, threaten to leave again to get control over you. But the minute you pull their signature move out on them they realize control is something they can never have with you so they leave. They cannot handle it. You dodged a major bullet. God bless you."
abusiverelationships,fo85uyz,t1_fo854we,1587590443.0,I feel like it’s a manipulative tactic to gauge if your partner is still interested in you. Because now he’s saying that I seemed upset all day yesterday and that I’m not happy here with him. There are reasons to why that is yet he wants me to just sweep it under the rug and show how much he means to me. It’s an insecurity thing. But it sure as hell is mind-boggling. They think we don’t know but we may know more than they do.
abusiverelationships,fo7x5yq,t1_fo7wvod,1587586071.0,Yea I already know he gaslights which of course he denies vehemently. I just never realized the “space card” was part of the act. Also learning he doesn’t do well with feeling rejected by me at all. So many things to think about right now.
abusiverelationships,fo7vhx4,t1_fo7u6mb,1587585252.0,So they don’t really want their space or to break up but they’re doing this for power? I feel so dumb right now.
AltLadyboners,fo65f41,t3_g3qm5w,1587547172.0,"Hmm... I never realized how dashing he is...
He cleans up well..."
adultery,flykl13,t1_flyj6qg,1585603900.0,Do you guys follow each other on ig?
adultery,flyhgzj,t1_flyfei3,1585602232.0,Why?
adultery,fly84mm,t1_fly7dc3,1585597295.0,when and how do you carry out the rated R communication?
Infidelity,fly697p,t1_fly59y0,1585596305.0,I did have an idiot ex who wanted to show me something on his browser once and lo and behold his dating profile appears. He was sorry he got caught but looking back I think he meant for all that to happen because how does it happen 3 times??? Plus he lived for drama to fed his narcissistic ego so getting caught didn't matter to him.
Infidelity,flxuwuh,t3_frpsm8,1585590294.0,I don't know why anyone of sane mind would delete messages that hold possible evidence of cheating right in your peripheral unless she knew you were blind or something.
loveafterporn,flklzd4,t1_fljlzbb,1585243412.0,He knows it bothers me but still does it. I don’t know if it’s right to ask him to stop. I don’t care if he jerks off but it’s the porn that upsets me. I mean he has to be if he’s taking his phone into the bathroom.
Affairs,flj5p34,t1_flizj0f,1585199719.0,Did you get out?
loveafterporn,flhuf5y,t3_fos864,1585169692.0,Ugh I can relate with you. Just recently I discovered my bf would rather jerk off in the bathroom to porn than be with me. When months before I told him I want more sex and he used the “too tired from work” excuse. Whatever. I can’t stop noticing whenever he goes into the bathroom now and I’m certain he’s still jerking off with his phone. I already feel like shit and the ugliest I’ve ever been in my entire life already and now this. I am so done and over this relationship. Hit me up with you ever need to talk.
Infidelity,flcd6co,t3_fnsbms,1585026707.0,"Sorry if someone already asked in the comments (I can’t read all of them). But has she ever invited you to her workplace to meet her coworkers or was there ever a time you told her you wanted to stop by for whatever reason (drop off lunch, go get lunch nearby, etc) and she says she’s too busy or whatnot? I feel like this is an indication somethings up in addition to her comparing you to him (the gym comment). I’m sorry you’re going through this."
unpopularopinion,fl8op6t,t3_fn5rjb,1584928605.0,Amen to this!
todayilearned,fl8oneg,t3_fn90jd,1584928572.0,LOL the only time a wife will be ok with her husband not listening. I’m sure she meant for him to come back home with the refund. Hahaha
NoStupidQuestions,fl4t3yz,t3_fj1odh,1584820819.0,"Considering how ill-prepared we are in the US for the pandemic (compared to nations like Finland, South Korea. etc.), do you think many of those staying here with a student or working visa will head back home the second they get a chance to?"
Nailpolish,fl3a02g,t1_fkah154,1584774481.0,Shit- I’m about to turn 32 and can’t paint my goddamn nails for beans. I cannot believe the talent of your brother-in-law. I hope he knows this!!! Tell him to keep doing what he loves! ❤️
narcissisticparents,fl39s7z,t3_fm61xv,1584774220.0,No- you are allowed to wish death onto people who have hurt you. I have a few people on my list I wish were dead. Feel free to message me if you need someone to talk to.
FriendsOver40,fkyrack,t1_fkyjim6,1584654499.0,Messaging you now!
PublicFreakout,fkyc2ss,t3_fl8ovx,1584645769.0,This is disgusting. Right up there with selfish dumbfucks hoarding all the tp and hand sanitizer you can find.
