Apparently from comments on here I’m just now realizing that the awkward shower scene carried over from last chapter was...outside? In the rain? Not in an actual shower? Like obviously I saw the outside background of the house, but I thought that was just a weird choice on PB’s part, and the actual scene was inside the house. I still don’t even know. If it’s outside, did Cassian go inside just to grab soap and shampoo? If it’s inside, why is the background outside? So confused. 

When Tomas called I thought “Finally something interesting is happening this chapter!” Aaaaand...it’s over. So this entire chapter was just a sex scene I didn’t want and couldn’t tap through fast enough."
