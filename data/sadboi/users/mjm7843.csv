Anxiety,foekro1,t3_g6u4dj,1587706410.0,I really needed this today. I have such bad health anxiety normally and it’s been so much harder to deal with during this. On top of that my dog died yesterday and my boyfriend got in a car accident. It’s been a rough couple days and I’m having a hard time focusing on anything. I know so many people have it worse right now but it’s been feeling really hard these past few days. Thank you for posting this!

The10thDentist,fnsomub,t3_g3hy6t,1587225827.0,It sounds like you have an eating disorder- maybe get that checked out?
DysfunctionalFamily,fiss5l7,t3_f9kdqc,1582691854.0,This is an abusive environment for your animals- imo it’s irresponsible to keep them in your house where your sister is physically abusing them. Also a bit worrying that she is displaying sociopathy symptoms. I know it’s probably very upsetting to contemplate giving them away but I think that would really be the best option for them if you can find a good home or a reputable shelter.
rupaulsdragrace,f9t155j,t3_e5xr0q,1575605703.0,I loved it so much more than I thought I would! It had levels I didn’t expect at all. It definitely wasn’t just some fluff publicity piece and tackled some hard subjects in an effective way. Was cool to see sides of Trixie I hadn’t seen before. Overall really enjoyed it!
