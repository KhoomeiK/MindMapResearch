Thing I've found about trying to stop it recently is when I dont take it I have terrible insomnia. It really does help with falling asleep and staying asleep all night.

If your doctor wants you to take it during the day then you really should be using the extended release version of the drug. Good luck"

nhs,fdelocx,t3_ekuc39,1578341661.0,I work in orthopaedics in a hospital and the consultants even have MRIs rejected sometimes because the radiographer needs more evidence that it is warranted. I'm surprised your GP even tried to request one. In my area this whole process from referral to an MRI can take anything up to 12 weeks and sometimes longer so if you are desperate you should probably ask your gp about a private referral.

The majority of the posts on their social media will make you feel bad with maybe one at most making you think ""well I'm glad I saw that"".

I think the reason why Devon (and not your son) came to you was because seeing your son would probably have had too much of an overwhelming emotional reaction for you. Instead here, Devon is the.messenger and the less emotional attachment to him made you able to allow communication.  This communication between you  and devon has enabled you to let go of guilt which seems to have already been taking its toll on your relationship, so this experience sounds like it has really helped."

You then book appointments to see a doctor at that surgery whenever you need to.. but there can be long waiting times for routine appointments.  For example  I need to see a doctor about some ulnar nerve impingement symptoms I've been getting and the next appointment is in about 5 weeks time. If I had an urgent problem then my surgery will get a doctor to call me that day and they decide if you need to be seen urgently. In which case you could see the doctor on the same day.
