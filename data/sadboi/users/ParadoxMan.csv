Thoughts turn into words such turn into actions. Listen I'm all for free speech, but you don't know the harm this  guy can cause, family's in Islam kill thier daughters, due to honor killings. I know what you mean, but we don't need people to start killing other people because they think they practice magic. I know you got downvoted here, and I also agree that people even on this subreddit also can act like a mob. I'm sorry that you were subjected to that, but I still feel my opinion on this matter helps the majority, and saves more people from harm.

In the first one, there is a link to the full decision. It is stated the program was rerun several times.

1. In the programme the presenter, an Islamic scholar, sat behind a desk on a raised dais. He spoke in a studio, which was made to appear like a classroom, with a group of young men seated behind desks. The scholar spoke uninterrupted throughout the programme, and at the end of the lecture he answered a few questions from those in the audience. He made a series of statements about killing Muslim people who practise “Sihr” or magic, including that: “the magician’s art or the practice of magic cannot be forgiven by way of repentance”; it was clear that magicians practicing magic commit “kufr”; under Shariah law, it is correct to “go ahead and kill the magician”; and, that magicians should be “killed forthwith”.
2. On the basis set out in Ofcom’s Decision (“the Breach Decision”) published on 22 July 2019 in issue 383 of the Broadcast and On Demand Bulletin, Ofcom considered that a significant proportion of the UK audience of the programme would understand “Sihr”, as used in the programme, to encompass the use of Taweez9 , and those practising this form of magic to be “magicians” as referred to in the programme. A significant proportion of the audience would also understand the term to encompass Ruqya. Ofcom understands that within the UK many South Asian and Sunni Muslim people consider such practices as part of a rich long standing historical Islamic tradition which they believe in, and in some cases practice. In the Breach Decision, Ofcom noted the recent case o

In this link there is a link to the full decision too

Lord Production broadcast one episode of Strengthening your Family on Peace TV. This episode, which was titled Valley of the Homosexuals, focussed on the issue of homosexuality and Islam. 6. The presenter, named on screen as Imam Qasim Khan, was sitting on a chair and spoke directly to the camera. He made a series of statements about homosexuality including: comparing homosexual people to animals, specifically a pig which the speaker referred to as an animal which was “nasty and corrupted”; asserting that homosexual people contract disease (by implication HIV and AIDS) “because they are homosexual”; and, describing the practice of homosexuality as insane, corrupt and a manifestation of satanic influence.

SuicideWatch,fkg7wdr,t1_fkfzlro,1584152196.0,"Sorry to interrupt you in another thread. I found a great book on suicide that I'm listening to at this moment on YouTube. It's 3 hours long and it's really great as it was written in the 1930's i believe during the heat depression. It's beautifully written and relavant even today. It's called Diary of a Suicide by Wallace E. Baker.  It's also free on the audiobooks.com app.

SuicideWatch,fkg7hj4,t1_fkg2hzw,1584151887.0,"Realising many things, that Jesus knew his father, yet many children do not know who they're father is, mother Mary was basically (to me) an allegory, that since prostitution is the oldest job there is, and contraceptives were ineffective, that the could have been many fatherless children in the past. Also that wherever there is good there is an unseen bad, many people just like being what they're told, and others cannot be told what to do. That love and hate are related and you don't need dependancies, because if you want love, it is very likely that you will also likely hate. Then again cold is the absence of heat, darkness is the absence of light. In any case I need to be objective with others and subjective with myself. I can only be my own best decision-maker, no one can take this place. If I don't get the help I need, its fine I now don't need it. I will work on being patient with myself."

Including my ego taking major bashes because I feel like people notice it, as and wonder why I am able to take so my abuse. Its largely extending on the factor that I am not able to perceive care and love from a coworker of mine, i have feelings for this girl, but I feel very jealous that we are not able to open up together. She talks with another guy during the shift, and is the main reason I have been feeling suicidal these past few years."

Actually being a person who practiced atheism pretty much my entire life, but after many days of being depressed and on drugs, this Ramadan helped me get off of them. Also I know that basically Islam can be grouped into the neo-platonism (love for all, hatred for none) that is apparent, through the love you receive from the resolution you get from His Mercy, you know that deep down that merit is wrong, e.g. gay behavior is a a substitute for weakness, and that fundamentally, more aggressive males/females pertain to heterosexual sex. I just follow the good where there is good, be it any of the major religions, I just like to take the good and refuse the bad, being quite the pacifist I am."
