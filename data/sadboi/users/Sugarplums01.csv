I can relate heavily to this. im 16/f. 2 suicide attempts in one month. struggle w depression, ptsd, etc and have extremely abusive parents. My advice is even though CPS can be useless and horrible (I  dont have the best experience either) its best to try your luck w them again and get a socail worker assigned to you. this worker if theyre good will be able to help you, talk to you and plan your future. if you can get to a group home, stay at friends place, etc even foster care do it. Its a shot in the dark i know but staying with your abusive parents it will only get worse. im currently am trying to move out asap. take jane if you can.

I basically od'd on my antidepressents, and antipsychs to kill myself My family and friends know the extent of my mental illnesses (depression, ptsd, anxiety,bpd, etc) but im always known as the positive bubbly one despite that y'know cause I don't really let it show.  alot of trauma comes from my parents. Maybe cause im young and sensitive (16) i thought ppl wouldnt just ignore me. I think my sister is feeling some bit guilty cause we had a huge argument and she started said some awful things. I didn't do this for attention yknow? But being alone the whole stay in hospital and then being ignored by everyone really stings. I feel so utterly alone. I already did and now it feels even worse. Honestly when I woke up the next day I was so dissapointed I was still there. Now I guess I have to find some motivation to live :) thanks <3"
Dogtraining,excaa9l,t3_crv5zi,1566146273.0,"omg my dog was the EXACT SAME! aadopted a mix from korea. he was fostered where i am for 1 moth. Foster family told me he BASICALLY house trained= he fucking wasn't. hes very stubborn and very smart. would hold pee. then go right before i would tkae him out. go days w/o going to the bathroom. Finally i have found a way to end this! If he doesn't ""go"" in your room or anyother house thats his i guess safe space and wont want to get that dirty. I would leave him in my room while at work,school, etc (w food, water, toys)  Before i left/in the morning i would walk him (always do same route to establish routine) as soon as i got back i would take him out. try to have 2 main bathroom places i guess. One/multiple i guess on your estbalioshed walk routine. so he knows that where he can go. and somewhere closer to home. like sidewalk or something if he has to go often. don't be afriad to leave your room and go to another part of the house. HOWEVER make sure he can't get his teeth on anything he can well- destroy. He will whine. You can ignore him but if he continues go up, put leash on and go outside. If he doesn't go after 2 min take him back in. don't be afriad to scoop him out of the house if youre worried he might stall and pee. places where hes made it a habit to go must be cleaned super super throughly as soon as the accident happens. after cleaning spray w apple cider vinigar or vinigar in general as its nontoxic but dogs HATE the smell. He will learn different behaviour for different things . etc: whining + wagging tail= hes bored and wants to play. whining plus pawing/scratching at door= bathroom. If he doesn't like the crate you can stick hom in there for 10-20 min as a timeout. Scold him (not too harshly ofc but yknow) it will take 1-3 weeks for him to really get it! Hope this helps! I tried multiple methods over the 8 months I've had him (hes 1year old) and this is the only thing that helps. OH i almost forgot. after he seems to get that hang of it. you can take him out of room when youre home BUT keep on leash and very close to you. When you come to frequent accident spots pick state clearly that thats a NO. and pick him up do he doesnt have time to sniff around etc. <3"
