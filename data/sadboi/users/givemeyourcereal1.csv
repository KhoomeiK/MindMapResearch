CarAV,fnbdmli,t3_g0qza4,1586813665.0,Are your RCA wires touching anything that could have engine whine. It could be amplifying the whine of the car to the speakers. Especially if you ran them with power to amp or next to a heater motor.

ptsd,fd6xtkt,t1_fd6wstm,1578197054.0,"I got help because my childhood best friend made me promise him I would go. It was go or die. I promised I would make a effort to try and get help. So I did. You gotta have faith in something. I didn‚Äôt believe in anything but I found faith in my friend. He believed in me. You gotta believe in you or the people here. Communicate and you will be fine. And you don‚Äôt have to keep up as much as you think you do. Comfort is great but it is a personal battle on the mind. Stay in his corner, but he is the one in the ring. Steady is the hand that builds. A shaky hand just drops tool. You will be ok."
ptsd,fd59nkw,t3_ek319n,1578175447.0,"For me, I had something similar with my girlfriend and family, I would have outbursts. I was up and down, I would lash out because of the pain I was in and it would build up. I used to keep it all in side and then I would go to my garage and punch a canvas punching bag until my fists bleed. I would scream at the bag and just destroy my fists into it. But as I started taking to people. All my emotions came out. The good and the bad. And I didn‚Äôt know how to control them which led to outbursts on the people I cared about. 

When he has these episodes, be there for him and don‚Äôt take what he says to heart too much. It‚Äôs years of pain coming out. And it‚Äôs gonna come out on anyone nearby. Use your love for him as a shield and see past the things he says. He is scared. I am not excusing the behavior but I can relate to it. But also take care of yourself. Your mental health is just as important. I would listen to music to calm me down but it also lets you block out what happens around you. You got this. Communicate and remember that love is kind. And love is patient. Be patient together. And remember you are not alone. I find comfort from the fact I can interact in a group like this and people listen. You will be ok! You got it."
