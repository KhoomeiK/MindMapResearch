relationship_advice,fpbi8m2,t1_fpbhe9f,1588470615.0,"I never called you disgusting, I called the crime OP's father committed disgusting, maybe you should go back and reread. Now you've resorted to assuming how I view the site because of my replies to you. Reddit is a place for lots of things, you're getting different opinions right now and you're getting upset. Maybe you only want opinions that are the same as yours? This is not the place for that.

I don't care if I have your respect, you are a person on Reddit that I will never meet in real life, your respect doesn't matter to me."
relationship_advice,fpbfr1f,t1_fpbebgp,1588468973.0,"You said the father would be an idiot to continue after OP said he knew, suggesting that that is a solution to OP's problem, and a way to get him to stop. You also said if he talks to his father and he shows no shame about it that OP should report it, you only mention reporting him in relation to his reaction to being confronted. Here's an idea, if the father is in prison for the crime he committed he will most definitely not be doing it again. So what I asked was what you suggest he does if the father does show shame and says he'll stop. You don't say anything about reporting him other than in the case that he doesn't show shame, suggesting that is the only reason to report him.

You didn't really address what I said in my last reply, you just resorted to questioning whether or not I understand English, that's a petty move, and not really a good way to prove anything in an argument."

relationship_advice,fpbcl1q,t1_fpba4zs,1588466942.0,"You say his father needs help, but what about the defenseless children he is watching? Do they not deserve help? Suggesting that OP doesn't report this to the police so that the father can get help is preventing an opportunity for these children to get the help they need.

Yes, quarantine is stressful. I've been off work since March 13th, I have mental health problems, guess what? I'm not looking at CP. It is disgusting that you suggest this is okay because he's in isolation and hasn't physically acted on this. Except he has acted on this by intentionally looking for this type of content. It doesn't matter if he hasn't physically done something directly to a child, he is contributing to CP, sex trafficking, and these disgusting acts by watching them.

Don't confront the father, he is committing a crime, he knows this is wrong, he deserves to be reported. Reporting him might mean that more people involved in these crimes get found out, and maybe some of these children can be rescued before more damage is done. Maybe before more of these awful human beings watch as other awful human beings commit their disgusting acts against helpless children."

This was before my diagnosis, but my doctor suspected it and I was just waiting for a referral. I thought about telling her when I was diagnosed and then I remembered the comment she made. She is great, but I'm not planning on telling her, don't want to be thought of basically being a toddler emotionally.

A lot of those people are potentially mistaking regular sadness for clinical depression and regular anxiety for a diagnosed anxiety disorder. It is normal to experience sadness and anxiety, but when it's a chronic issue it is different. Not having a perfect day everyday is normal, having suicidal thoughts is not.

Don't even get me started on people who think they have OCD because they have a clean house. Those people have no idea what the disorder is actually like, and that's coming from someone who was diagnosed almost 10 years ago. I've had 6 people in the past year alone talk about ""being OCD"", who, when I've asked, have clarified that they haven't been diagnosed but ""definitely have it"". This doesn't include the countless people who claim to have OCD online while stereotyping it.

Oh you're not happy 24/7? Sometimes you get hyper? Sometimes you are sad? So you think you have bipolar disorder? Bipolar disorder sucks, I hate it, don't know why anybody would want it, or want people to think they have it.

BipolarReddit,fnt0tme,t1_fnszhby,1587232457.0,"Okay that makes sense, I can see how it would be shocking in that way. I am also a very private person, I've never had any social media other than Reddit and email too if that counts. I can't stand the idea of being on the internet for people to find. I never would have thought I would share as much as I have on here, but that's the beauty of anonymity! My husband isn't as private so he doesn't find it strange, but I can see how your SO would.

I hope they come around when they see the good that can come out of sharing. It definitely helps others, but it also helps you too, make sure when you do share it with them that you emphasize that! Just make sure to never share personal/identifying details on here and you're good!"
BipolarReddit,fnsxueb,t1_fnsw81z,1587230857.0,"Why do you think they would want you to delete it? If it helps you talk about things I think it's a good thing!

The way I see it is that getting perspective from the people on Reddit who don't know me in real life might make it easier to share in real life later on. Maybe sharing a passage would help your SO understand, but I would definitely take it very slow and not share it all at once, that might be overwhelming to them."
offmychest,fnsqr00,t3_g3nwwn,1587226998.0,"I'm so sorry for what you're going through. I'm going through the same situation, but in my case I'm the unmedicated spouse. I was diagnosed with BP2 last year and most likely BPD as well, but the appointment where I was supposed to get a formal diagnosis of BPD was cancelled because of COVID-19. I was also supposed to receive a prescription at that time.

At first I didn't want medication, but my experience in the past 5 weeks being off work, alone all day without the distraction and routine of work has convinced me how much I need medication. I feel awful for my husband having to deal with my moods. I rapid cycle and my moods are all over the place. I have great respect and sympathy for the people who have the patience and compassion to love people like myself and your wife. It is not easy.

I wish I had advice to give you that will get your wife to take her medication, but she needs to make that choice on her own, try and remind of who she is when she's stable. Please remember to take time for yourself, it is not selfish to maintain your own sanity and well-being. I am sure your wife will reach a point where she realizes how much better her life was on medication, but I don't know when that will be. Please try and remember who she is when she's stable, but do not sacrifice your own well-being, your mental health is important too."
BipolarReddit,fnsng91,t3_g3otl7,1587225168.0,"I accidentally showed my husband my username when I showed him a comment I made, but he has promised not to look up my account. I post a lot of stuff on here that I have a hard time talking about in real life, and I like knowing I can talk about things anonymously. I don't read his journal, he doesn't read my posts, that works for us. Not everything has to be shared, we're open with each other but it's nice to have something just for myself."
bipolar2,fnoy0re,t1_fnoph9s,1587135742.0,"Oh my god, I am so sorry, that must be really hard for you to be going through right now. He is letting you go, but it seems like he's not in a place to give you what you need in a relationship. Please remember this isn't to hurt you, it's to prevent you from getting hurt. He sounds like he isn't ready for a relationship, and that's not your fault. Love can be a wonderful support for someone who is struggling, but it is not a cure. Just please try and remember that this might be what's best for him right now, and it seems like he is making a mature decision, but it is not because you did something wrong or didn't do enough. Remember to take care of yourself right now, I know it will be hard to move forward, I hope you will be okay."

OCD,fnmbmp3,t1_fnlk9cn,1587068513.0,"I came here to say something similar, but you phrased it really well! 

I used to push my intrusive thoughts away out of disgust and fear but it only makes them more distressing and powerful. I've learned to let them in, and remind myself that these are intrusive thoughts and not things I wish to act on. I have learned to live with them and I do my best to remind myself that although they occur in my head they are not what makes up my personality. They are a symptom of a disorder not a symptom of who I am."
OCD,fnm742m,t3_g2jiji,1587066246.0,"I do! It sucks, to say the least. I was diagnosed with OCD almost 10 years ago as a teenager, but I was only diagnosed with BP last November, so I'm still trying to figure out how my symptoms affect each other. My compulsions are mostly under control, but they definitely can get out of control when I'm hypomanic and carelessly energetic. The intrusive thoughts are always there but probably a bigger issue while I'm in a depressive episode."

dpdr,fnftcch,t3_g1hncg,1586915039.0,"When I recall memories it's always in third person. Say I'm remembering a conversation with someone in which we're sitting at a table, I would see both of us as if it were a scene from a movie. I'm the main character and the story is from my own memory but I'm not seeing it as I saw it at the time through my own eyes. Does that make sense? It seems jumbled reading it. 

I often feel like a character, like the me that's interacting with people is just on autopilot and I'm inside watching. It's a strange feeling, but I don't see myself in third person as things are happening, only in memories."

ThunderBay,fnes5mb,t1_fnenjp5,1586894887.0,"Do you really believe the world operates on logic? The government is going to make decisions in this situation that will keep it in good favour with the general public, how do you think people would react if they prioritized the economy? People would lose their minds. The ""people are more important than money"", virtue signaling, love and compassion response is in the their best interest, so that is what they're doing.

I wish the world operated logically, but it doesn't. I don't want people to die, but I also don't want to be facing everything that comes after this, I also don't make those decisions. 

This is happening. This is happening the way it is happening. Griping about it on Reddit isn't going to change any of that. As long as people get their $2000/month nobody is going to care what happens after until it actually happens.

I know after this is over things will be worse. I know that. I'm not an idiot. I know that it won't be sunshine and rainbows, that's not what this whole conversation was about. I think you're missing the fact that I agree with you that this is going in a terrible direction. I can't change any of this."

AmItheAsshole,fnbstra,t3_g0nmmw,1586821631.0,"YTA for separating the couples during dinner which probably made a lot of people uncomfortable. 

This does sound like it could have been really fun though if everybody took a sorting test or something instead, rather than just deciding which house they were in for them!

I appreciate the idea and I also love HP (fellow Ravenclaw) but I would be really uncomfortable to be separated from my husband at a wedding reception."
