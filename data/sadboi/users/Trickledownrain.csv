You need to challenge those ideas when they come into your mind and replace them with the thoughts you'd rather have about women. You need to figure out what you really do believe about women, or what's actually true about them and that can be as simple as they're just as complex and dynamic as men.

Codependency,fqzg81z,t1_fqyv1re,1589766709.0,"""today I think my boundaries inconvenience others and doubt me setting them would change things anyways, I also believe other peopleâ€™s preferences matter more than my boundaries""

This is extremely relatable. I sometimes catch myself feeling this way and with some people for the former half of your comment it's true. They don't care about you or your boundaries. Either through their own incompetence to consider others, or their sheer lack of will to bother.

With others, you may need to set the boundaries over, and over, and over again over time. You are correct, you will indeed be challenged. When you are however, it's an opportunity to decide, to decide how strongly you'd like to move forward with reasserting your boundary. Either through figuring out a compromise (if it's something you WANT and are willing to compromise on) or if it's time to go full nuclear and just end the relationship either forever or until they're able to respect your wishes.

People aren't tape recorders after all and sometimes people do forget. I think you're well aware that there are those who don't ""forget"" even if they claim to. Trust your gut, you'll know the difference because when people like that come around you can tell, you don't feel this way with everyone right? That's your gut talking to you.
That's where more stricter action may need to be taken.
It really doesn't matter what the other person thinks about your boundaries in terms of their validity. They're yours and you have them for a reason and it's your choice if you want to consider their desires in terms of (if you choose to) adjusting them. 

Don't debate people either. Set your boundary, if you have consequences attached to the breach of those boundaries, then enforce those too. Other people may not respect your boundaries but you most certainly can. 

Everyone has boundaries, whether you realize them or not. Take baby steps. Whenever you hear your inner critic (your false critic) telling you you're not entitled to respect and to have boundaries, try telling yourself this is an outdated belief and you're proud of yourself for realize this and remind yourself of the efforts you're making towards moving yourself closer to the person you want to be.

That's helped me a lot. Something else that has helped me is a sort of exposure therapy. Try drawing a large circle on a piece of paper, with a bit of space to write on the outside of it. Then a circle inside that again with a big of space to write, then another circle inside that. 

1)The outer part of the first circle represents strangers. People you've never met before. You already have boundaries set with them. The majority of society does and we move throughout this world respecting those boundaries without much issue. Write some of those down. Some of the one's you can think of, and then (on another piece of paper if needed) write down some little moments you can recall where you noticed someone respecting those automatic and basic boundaries.

2) Inside the first circle you wrote are people like baristas, customer service reps, passers bye whom you may have a chat with, just slightly above strangers. Repeat the same step from above, but this time, ad a situation you may encounter that you'd like to work on setting better boundaries for. Once you've written down some boundaries, write down what you'd like to try to practice if any of those boundaries are broken. Do you want to compromise? Do you want to set it again but setting a limit on the amount of times you're going to try to enforce it? When is your breaking point for this boundary and what would you like to do if you reach that point with said boundary?
Starting small is a great way to build your confidence. Baby steps can get you so much further than you know.

3)The next circle in are friends, acquaintances, work/school mates and people of that level of connection & intimacy. Repeat step 2

4) The last circle represents the people in your life you are closest to, immediate family, best of friends, close cousins, ect. Repeat step 2 again.  This is the hardest circle to work on because it is the closest to us and people we value the most. 

5) Be forgiving of yourself. It really does take practice, a lot of practice. You've spent YEARS living like this and no one changed over night. You've gone through and may still be going through something no one should have to. So be patient with yourself, when you notice yourself criticizing yourself in a negative way, do your best to shift those thoughts to more understanding thoughts about yourself. Reflect upon moments of success no matter how small and remind yourself you're a work in progress and you can always try again.

6) Be proud of yourself for the progress and efforts you make, even if you're not completely successful. Every attempt, and then effort to try again (even if not with the same person) is excellent progress. 

Few! Ok, I hope that was clear. Sorry it's so long."
Codependency,fqy49bo,t3_glgczb,1589742338.0,"I think it has to do with basically being ""trained"" into feeling negatively when we stand up for ourselves and assert ourselves. It's become so closely associated with abuse it's often linked to negative feelings. We've been punished so often that it feels intrinsically linked. If we set boundaries we may be hurt through the loss of the person, or the punishment they decide we deserve.   


It's taken me a lot of work to break free from that false guilt and fear of abandonment and loss, and it's still there but I'm getting better and better.

Second, If you have a key, you don't need his permission to enter your place of residence and get your items. Have some support there, or better yet get a police escort to be there to supervise.   


Third, stop sending him photos of your children who A) he clearly doesn't care about and B) whoa re terrified of them. He doesn't care, and they are scared of him. There's no reason for you to antagonize him. He doesn't care. No matter what he may have said, or may say, he doesn't. If he isn't asking for it, don't do it, and even if he is, think long and hard before doing it.   


Fourth, stop communicating with this absolute piece of shit unless it's absolutely necessary.

I've been working with this T for over a year now. It's been productive but I don't think they feel I take this seriously due to my inability to attend frequently. Although they've praised my progress in the past. I'm also an introvert and not very dependent on others which I've found has caused people to not invest much in me or feel I don't require/warrant the same level of attention as others who exhibit a higher level of dependency? If that makes any sense. I've noticed it no matter where I go in situations where a reasonable level of attentiveness would be given. From hospital psych ward, doctors visits, socially, and in familial situation,  it tends to be status quo. When you're a damaged wheel but don't squeak you tend to be ignored or put off.

vancouvercycling,fq71hqn,t1_fq6p90h,1589140567.0,"Thank you!I took it to another local shop and they reaffirmed my concerns. Basically the bike wasn't set up right, something is indeed off with both the breaks and the crank-set derailleur setup. They'll have it corrected for me within a weeks time and will cost me under a bill.

The original shop hasn't even bothered to email me back. I feel like I was duped because they wouldn't provide a fitting when I first got the bike which was advertised as included with the purchase. Which was fine, Covid19 and all. So they said if there are any problems just email, anything at all. Was adamantly reassured to contact them with any issues. Nothing to big or small...I guess they meant I could contact them but they wouldn't reply after one attempt at fixing a problem only to make it worse. 

Never going back to that place again. Really unfortunate too, they seem to have a nice shop."
JustNoSO,fq6gs3g,t3_gh1uug,1589131225.0,"Ok, I didn't read all of it, because I don't feel I need to. Try doing a nice big old, long deep dive into Narcissists. You've got one on your hand. She's trying to steal from you and is just using you as her scapegoat. She's an awful person and your partner is under her thumb. Frankly, counseling is in order and even then he may not see it, even if he does that doesn't mean he's going to be able to break free.  


If you're ready to leave for a better life, do it. Don't waste any more time, any more of your life being unhappy. There are better things out there. Better people too."
CyclingFashion,fq2xke4,t3_ggnxvq,1589061044.0,"Well, if you price it with the expectation of riding it at least 320 times over the span of 3-4 years that's $1 a ride. If it lasts even longer (which with proper care I wouldn't be surprised it does) that's even cheaper still per ride.  


Calculating it that way, how would you feel about owning it? Especially if it encourages you to get out more. It really is a lovely piece."
vancouvercycling,fq2ugsv,t3_ggntqn,1589059835.0,"I honestly wouldn't have much faith in them in terms of quality. The first thing I notice when looking in the Women's section is they have 22 pages of just the short sleeve jersey options. They're all of the same construction sans the sleeve finish. It seems like the only real difference is the print in between them. Which you can find cheaper when looking overseas and likely result in the same quality just fewer prints to pick from.  


It's like those online graphic tshirt shops but for cycling. Endless options to pick from in terms of the graphics, but the base product is the same."
IncelTear,fq2t0oy,t1_fq2sef0,1589059363.0,"Ahh, that makes sense... I mean, there must be gaycels out there too right? Hopefully they're not as idiotic and hateful as this jerkwad but they must be out there."

JUSTNOFAMILY,fpyhqx3,t3_gfu0zv,1589004094.0,"I think your last paragraph captures it nicely. It's his last ditch effort to selfishly absolve himself of any guilt he felt for leaving, or worse yet, to be remembered as a 'good and caring guy' after he's gone.

The breaks are so bad, they'll like, do this weird sticking thing where they end up making this weird sound, that's the front one's and the back one's only work intermittently. On top the the derailleur now skipping more than when I first brought it in. As well as a consistent rubbing that's gotten worse since dropping it off.   


The breaks I could see missing as it doesn't happen all the time, but the derailleur seems like it'd be notable."
vancouvercycling,fpy0kr9,t1_fpxzcyw,1588993422.0,Nope! It was a bike specific shop that's got a good reputation. I was was surprised by the results I received.

FuckYouKaren,fpsxx6a,t3_gf8xth,1588881486.0,When idiots don't understand that the use of the word Karen encapsulates the long winded argument they feel entitled to every time they or others are cunts. Fuckin' Karen's.

BreakUps,fps3r7g,t3_gf91sc,1588866965.0,"""Largely been NC"" is not the same as no contact. If you're still communicating with this person that's not no contact. There's no such thing as NC lite.   


You don't miss him. You said it yourself, you miss the feeling of love... If you're codependent then you've got a lot of work to do because using people as emotional tools is still using them. From the sounds of it that may have been the case here unfortunately.  


Start asking yourself some important questions and challenging the ideas you have, like, why do you NEED to be in a relationship? Why can't you be on your own? Why are you disappointed you haven't sniffed out a new source like a truffle pig failing to sniff out it's prize?"

You'll thank yourself later."
instant_regret,fpn2rgl,t1_fpn0q9a,1588748423.0,"Yup, flight, fight, or freeze. People always think they'll know exactly what to do when confronted with an alarming out of no where type situation. It's sadly just not the case for everyone to have a response at the ready, especially for such unorthodox an encounter."
EtsySellers,fpn0xi0,t3_ge4873,1588746962.0,"Ha ha ha ha, let them threaten all they want. Are you two in the same city/country? Also, when? When on earth does this person think they're going to be able to do this? Depending upon where you're located that may not even be an option right now. Aside from all the other logistical stupidity of this. This person is just trying to get something for free... I mean, where I am, filing alone costs you at least $75 in fees, that's not including any of the money lost through time loss of having to attend court.  


What a joke. Just tell them you appreciate their understanding about the postal issue, you hope they enjoy their new items but threats will not be tolerated and be done with it.  


Your item has tracking, it will show delivered. If they open a case or write  negative review associated with shipping times it won't count against ODR."

NarcissisticAbuse,fpk3uke,t3_gdwpgr,1588687443.0,"The whole ""I've changed"" thing is a common routine, or the ""I'll change""...""I'll get better"" you name it.

The thing about people claiming they'll change is you have no idea how they're going to change or if they change they're aiming for will mean you two will work better together. Change can mean they'll change to become WORSE! When someone changes it's generally motivated by their own desires of whom they'd like to be and there's no guarantee they'll get there.  
Generally with abusers change means they'll get better at being more covert and stealthy with their abuses, or they'll get better at shifting blame, manipulating ect. Sure, they've improved...in the most horrible possible fucking way. If they blamed you before, they're not going to stop now.  


I had a narc whom I parted ways with last year, it was a casual relationship with no plans for a long term future we both agreed to, that didn't stop him. He seemed to acknowledge his issues although not fully..but also later claimed himself to be a sociopath...Ah the rollercoaster no one wants to ride, not even them. Anyways, he was always claiming he was trying to change. I'll admit, he did. He's gotten worse, much, much worse. He's switch one addition for another, become more covert and in denial about his abuses and manipulation, oddly he's either unaware of it or doesn't give a shit about how evident his endless blatant lying has gotten.  Like, it's all the time. He's become more malignant as well. So, I mean, he followed through with what he claimed, but not in the way I think they try to dupe people (and themselves) into believing they will.  


Don't ever forget, change doesn't always mean for the better."
