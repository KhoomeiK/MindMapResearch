But I'll think about it some more and *really will* try to not let this be abused later on. I guess that the fact that the player was looking for useful rituals to use against a Sabbat raid made me think that he was aiming for an one time use, when his Chantry really needs it. But maybe he was thinking that he could use it more often than that. I didn't consider that at the moment."
WhiteWolfRPG,f3ou0uy,t1_f3ory7b,1571028668.0,"We thought of that too. I think its a little limiting for what I think the ritual actually is made for, though. Imagine being in a floor ridden with surveillance cameras and you can only deactivate one. It's not really useful and certainly less dramatic. I don't want to bend the rules of its use everytime the player casts the ritual, so I'm really hesitant to do this."
WhiteWolfRPG,f3otph3,t1_f3orps0,1571028347.0,"Hello!

First, let me thank you for taking the time to answer. Now, about the first point you made; usually the rituals are somewhat clear at what they do and how many prep time/resources are needed and we don't have any problem understanding them, but this one is really vague for the complexity of its effects. All it says about preparations for the ritual is that you need a scrap of rusted metal or, in a variation of the ritual, a piece of string or a knot to be steeped in human saliva. Nothing else. No blood points, uninterrupted chanting or prolonged casting time. Honestly, it's suspiciously easy.

All the rest that you've said makes perfectly sense and I'll definitely consider it when the Tremere tries to sneak a get out-of-trouble free card."
