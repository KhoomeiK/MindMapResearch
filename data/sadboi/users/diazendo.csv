There is a demand for vegan products, more and more nowadays, just go into a supermarket and see how many vegan products there are in comparison to 20 years ago. 

Government intervention is something that would be nice to achieve, because there need to be far more animal & human rights and environmental restrictions on companies, however no that's not realistic in the short-term. Eating meat being a cultural thing doesn't matter. You could argue that slavery was a cultural thing. People eventually realised that it was wrong, and this realization has started happening with animal agriculture. Progress is slow but I'm going to keep hoping and keep doing as much as I can to help liberate animals, because I'm not going to be complicit in their suffering. I don't want to live in a world where animals are abused in the masses, and as customers, we all have the power to stop it."

Even if they're quiet, the coming into my room is so irritating because even if I was asleep before, my brain wakes up, I guess, and I can just feel someone's there which can be terrifying. A few weeks ago, I jolted awake to just see my mum staring right at me while I slept, which made me jump so hard. A similar thing happened a few days ago, when I suddenly opened my eyes to see my mum in my room but it was a sort of hallucination, so she looked like a demon... Straight up nightmare fuel.

Generally, going outside is quite safe because you're unlikely to encounter a deadly pathogen, and people need to go outside for work, school etc. so of course I'm not going to stay inside 24/7 - that's not healthy anyways.

But the first time your body encounters it, it produces an immune response which involves essentially killing the pathogen and creating memory cells that remember the virus's antigen and the necessary antibodies to fight it.

Vegans aren't telling you to starve to death if you're in a scenario where the only option is to eat meat. However, is this a situation that the average Brit/American finds themself in? No. There are a multitude of vegetables, fruits, meat substitutes & dairy substitutes available in most first world countries, so a vegan diet is accessible to them.

I think we can agree that not all living organisms have the same level of sentience, so yes, I believe it is okay for orca to kill whales, but not for humans to kill whales. The reason for this is because humans have morals; if we see an animal in pain, our natural instinct is to help it. As far as I'm aware, an orca wouldn't care. As the organisms with the highest level of sentience, we do have a responsibility to treat other organisms well. ""With great power comes great responsibility"" etc. I think that the way we treat the most vulnerable creatures that live amongst us shows a lot about us, and what I'm seeing is disgusting.

I do love and care about her, but at the same time I don't really form close bonds with anyone so I don't care that she likes someone else. I do want these types of relationships with people, but I'm also indifferent about the fact that I don't have them, so I just don't feel sad I guess."
DoesAnybodyElse,finvjv9,t1_fin3mn4,1582571030.0,"Same - big bump from hitting it on a tree root (literally the lamest way to break your nose??), and the tip is bulbous like my mother's. I hate it so much, but because I used to look okay from the front, I never realised how disgusting it was and didn't know why I seemed so repulsive to everyone. Definitely going to get it fixed."
6thForm,fil9yos,t3_f8gmko,1582496876.0,"I do both. To be honest, I struggled with chemistry at GCSE, and I'm still struggling now because it does take time to understand. But as long as you make sure you have some good notes, and more importantly do lots of practice questions, you can do well. I don't think it's too different from GCSE, just as somebody else said, you find out that concepts were oversimplified. It's my hardest but most interesting A-Level, and definitely rewarding when you do well.

Biology is eh. The worst part imo is the volume of content (a lotttt more than GCSE), you can't just get away with knowing the basics. And to get a good grade, you need to make sure you've looked at mark schemes and know what info they want. I liked bio in the beginning but not so much anymore, but I think that's more to do with my teachers.
Anyway, as long as you have some interest in each subject and put effort in, you can definitely do well."
AskReddit,fighcp5,t1_fif2kz7,1582399471.0,"I have a really close friend who I always do small favours for, because it's no hassle for me and I enjoy helping her. I asked her 3 times to give me a homework sheet (that was ALL I asked, because I missed a lesson and the teacher gave her the sheet to give to me), that was apparently too much effort for her. I don't get pissed off easily, but yeah, that definitely made me question the friendship."

depression,fi8u09l,t3_f6tnuw,1582248323.0,"i definitely get awkward, e.g. if someone tries to get me to open up to them, i take ages trying to pick words that will essentially tell them nothing and also get them off my back in the nicest way possible. i'm not used to people actually wanting to listen to my problems. and i cannot take compliments, especially if they're appearance related because a) i know it's a lie, and b) it's usually obscure things like ""you have a unique look"" which makes me feel 100x more insecure because that pretty much equates to ""you're ugly"" :/"
depression,fhsjkdd,t3_f4kox4,1581861777.0,"And it's literally the worst when you've been bullied and judged for your mental illness symptoms, throughout most of your teenage years, to have the same people that bullied you, now claim to be depressed. I never fucking mentioned mental illness at school because of the stigma, but I got called a psychopath by random people and my friends told me I look like a school shooter because I always look emotionless and speak in monotone. That's because of depression and trauma, and I don't choose to portray myself like that. 
I went to the doctor to get help, but stopped not long after, partly due to feeling so invalid because I felt like I wasn't taken seriously because all teenagers now claim to have depression. It's left me feeling so alone, because I genuinely have nobody to turn to. On the brightside, I turn 18 soon, so at least I'll soon be out of school's toxic environment."
depression,fhnae89,t1_fhn03ud,1581724064.0,"I don't know how to describe them, they're quite confusing and I don't remember the details usually. One of them last night was about me getting drunk and going to a shop and I can't remember what happened but there were feelings of embarrassment and loneliness. The night before was about an acquaintance manipulating my friends which turned into something really bad. They are somewhat relevant to my life, and I've had frequent nightmares my whole life that were related to trauma but now they're just more abstract I guess."
depression,fhn9j4p,t1_fhmws3o,1581723693.0,"Thanks. I try to listen to music to relax, but it seems like the thoughts won't leave my mind. The only time I truly get away from them is when I'm drunk, which isn't ideal..."
depression,fhfb280,t3_f2qshl,1581539824.0,"unfortunately i have no advice, but i can relate. i agree so much and i wish people would just stop fucking lying about it. looks only don't matter when you're conventionally attractive. or average, at least.
i so badly wish that i didn't have an appearance like i just hate that i physically exist and people everyday, including myself, see me and judge me. it feels like so many of my problems are due to how i look, and people will never like me or want to talk to me because i'm ugly.
comments really do stick with you; one that i especially remember was a few years ago when people in my grade were discussing prom dates, and a girl said that ""some people won't need plus ones, there are some butters girls in our grade"" (butters essentially means very ugly btw) and then she gestured at me to her friends... yeah, i heard that. i'm not even mad about that comment, it just hurts because it's true."
6thForm,fh2kn5t,t3_f17ti6,1581256210.0,"My method was finding the % abundance for the third isotope by doing 100 - (91.0+1.8) = 7.2

Then, I multiplied 32.16 by 100 to work back, which got me 3216 which I know is the sum of each isotope multiplied by its % abundance. 

Next, I did 3216 - ((32 x 91.0) + (33 x 1.8)) to get the answer 244.6 , which I therefore know is the mass of the isotope multiplied by its % abundance (7.2). So, I divide 244.6 by 7.2 to get 33.97, which is 34.0 rounded to 3 sig fig"

the only reason i didn't leave was because leaving would make me even more anxious, because i'd have to explain why i left, and people would be judging me for just suddenly leaving. i think it's about the environment and just feeling, idk, suffocated and vulnerable to everyone around me."
