I stayed on my meds throughout my pregnancy (Trileptal, Buspar, and Zoloft).  No side effects.

Did have a bout of postpartum depression (I was in the hospital a month before he was born, he was born early, had a NICU stay, dad had to go back to work soon after son's birth so it was me taking care of my son alone most of the time unless my mom was taking care of him when I went to my part time job).  I felt like I was in a fog for a good 6-8 weeks after his birth.

All this being said, I feel like I am the right mom for him.  I have a chronic condition and so does my son so medically managing his condition is like second  nature to me because I've had to manage bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.  

He has an anxious side, but I know that getting help early is important so we are on the waiting list for a child psychologist.  

He'll be an only child due to his medical conditions, plus I had complications with my pregnancy during the third trimester so I'm fine with one and done.
