HiTMAN,fpg9xha,t3_gd5wjh,1588598124.0,"I grew up playing the shit out of contracts and blood money but i have to say seasons 1 and 2 are clearly superior in every aspect except maybe the storyline, although this is not really a game in which story matters that much.

The great number of kill possibilities, the beautiful levels, etc in the new ones imo make them the best. I do wish the music was better and weapon customization existed though."

HiTMAN,fmt5xku,t3_fxa512,1586367385.0,"A better rating system (similar to blood money at least). 

At least 8 levels, slightly more compact and without having 3 targets in different corners of the map (santa fortuna, mumbay).

The ability to switch off side objectives (clues on whittleton creek, etc) once you finish the game with SA on all levels.

Being able to carry the fiber wire, the coins and the picklock all at once. Doesnt make sense at all why 47 could not do that much...

Being able to select the time of day in the level, for example i hate the lighting in mumbay and colorado and i wish i could change the weather. Also a level like whittleton creek would look interesting in the night time.

Personally i also think the bloom effect in s2 sucked really bad, i would like to be able to turn it off."

HiTMAN,fk1en7v,t3_ffes87,1583778119.0,"Personally i dont actually hate it, but the story is quite absurd, some of the characters are just parodies, the disguises are useless far too often and the game is too linear and has very low replayability.

Some levels like King of chinatown, shaving lenny and attack of the saints are fun and memorable. I also really like the darkness in some of the levels, which i hope will be back in Hitman 3."

What sucks even more though is that everyone considers you somewhat of a loser and a weirdo if you dont actively date them. Theres pretty much no reason though to date anyone since you never find anything else other than a shallow materialist.
