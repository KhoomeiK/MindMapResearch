mentalhealth,fqlsd61,t3_gjijsv,1589465156.0,I really understand this. I went through more or less the same thing I was abandoned my my mam and my father and brother weren't very nice to put it simple. I've been diagnosed with so many mental health problems because of my childhood. But you have to think your a better person you may be scarred from it but you are not the same as them.

It's not all about the mood swings, theres alot more and I think if you spoke to your therapist about it she would see if you fit in that criteria depending on how you feel. It's always best to speak about it even if you dont think its needed"

mentalhealth,fpx2dln,t1_fpww6tw,1588974361.0,I totally agree. I was so scared to tell anyone what was going on in my head when I was growing up and when I did I got the help I needed and diagnosed with what I really was suffering with. Writing it down helps so much I cant explain it enough. Once you write it I can promise there will be a massive weight off your shoulders
mentalhealth,fpx24co,t3_gg0u65,1588974222.0,"I'm sorry you feel this way, but I went through the same thing. And it was not good for me at all, you need to find something new that you may be interested in. You have to discover new things, when I was poorly I didnt leave the house for months I talked to noone at all and that make my disorder even worse and I really hope you dont go down the same path. My dms are always open, please stay safe and think positive."

mentalhealth,fob45s2,t3_g6dwi6,1587655927.0,"I'm 24, and I have suffered with depression since I was young, I was the exact same I hated social interaction I was awkward and if I had my way I'd spend every day in my room. However when I was 21 I had enough of feeling the way I was and I I overdosed after been in hospital for a while I was finally diagnosed properly with bipolar. I started showing signs when I was 15 but my family ignored it. The best thing I've done since my diagnosis is even if I'm not motivated to do things I wouldn't usually do. Whatever life throws at you you can handle, trust me. Try and discover new things, exercise helps amazingly."
