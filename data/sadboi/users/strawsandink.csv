Getting treatment is one of the best things I have had happen, becuse now I have good days and bad days, not just bad days.  The path of treatment and finding stability is rocky, and the stigma does suck, but you have a strong and large community of support available to you if you know where to look.  

Remember, you aren't the problem here, your brin just works differently from the neurotypical brain, and that's okay.  There is nothing to be shamed about, and you did nothing to ""deserve"" BP, it just happened, it's a part of you and you didn't ask for it.  You will learn the nuance of your symptoms and hopefully over time make peace with the fact that your mind just works differently.  Your path may have changed based on the diagnosis, but it sounds like you have the access to the treatment you need and that's a serious blessing. The hardest part of BP for me, aside from the stigma others create, is when I don't have access to the care I need.  Not having treatment can be a true he'll on earth. 

This diagnosis should be a wakeup call for you to start treating yourself with care and compassion.  Find a support group, find a good therapist and doctor, try every line of treatment you can until you find something works for you, and find people who will love and support you. Your self care comes first now above everything else, and I mean that.  

I have been struggling with my mental health, and been in and out of therapy and treatment for over 10 years now.  If you have any questions or wanna talk soot me a PM.  Best of luck on your journey toward wellness."

bipolar,ffpfygh,t3_euh6yt,1580094086.0,"Every six months or so I have a depressive episode like that. The last one was so hard. I cried every day all throughout day, at my desk at work, at home, in public, I didn't know I could even cry so much. It felt like losing My best friend, but worse, and all the time.  My feelings changed with time and treatment, and I am now stable and have been since August. You never know how things will change, and I think it's worth it to at least see what will happen next. With bipolar it seems like change is inevitable. Sometimes people who haven't been stable for years sudenly find a treatment that works for them and they are stable for years to come. You just never know what the next day will bring. 

 I know how hard it is to be symptomatic without access to medications, I was there very recently. Keep your mind focused on the goal of getting to your next doctor's appointment. Try to focus as much as you can on that goal when things feel hard."
