Drugs,fh23rs1,t3_f13nuj,1581233888.0,"To answer your question, 2 days of Clonazepam should not cause you to have withdrawal symptoms once the drug wears off.

However, I do want to point out that snorting (insufflation) benzos is not worth it. The bioavailability is literally cut in half when snorting benzos, so just stick to oral as your ROA."
Drugs,fh1q4aa,t3_f11osv,1581220946.0,"They’re essentially the same drug. Both are gabapentinoids that effect the GABA receptors in the brain.

There are however some differences that I’m aware of. Pregabalin (Lyrica) has a higher potency per mg, and also a higher bioavailability when taken (please only do orally, as the percentage is upwards of 90%+). Gabapentin (Neurontin) has a lower potency per mg (typical recreational dose for me is around 1200 mg, anything over that doesn’t do much), and a lower bioavalability (but still extremely high, so again, please stick with oral as your ROA).

The recreational effects of these drugs are still being studied by psychonauts everywhere, but on average users report mild cognitive euphoria, slight sedation, anxiolytic effects, and an increase in appetite. However, these drugs tend to effect everyone differently. Some report no effect when taking either (even with “strong” doses), others report benzodiazepine effects. I will say, that I’ve never heard of anyone experiencing negative **recreational** effects, but that doesn’t mean it can’t happen. Some drugs are enjoyable to certain people, while others are overwhelming and intrusive.

For me, personally, the recreational effects of these compounds are extremely minimal. I much prefer their medicinal effects, so I usually only take them if I need them (plus tolerance grows exponentially faster than most substances). For instance, amphetamine come downs (they tend to help my racing thoughts, and begin to relax), after opiate binges (they help immensely with restless legs), and generalized anxiety.

For more information and user reports, check out each substance on psychonautwiki(dot)org."
Drugs,fh16adl,t1_fh0orbf,1581211328.0,"I think it’s open to interpretation, but I’m guessing it’s IV amphetamines, considering during the song (and in The Wall) the artist is detached from himself, incapable of moving, likely from opiates, benzos, (hence comfortably numb) or barbituates.

The shot is to wake him up enough to go on stage to finish the show.

Nonetheless the chorus, which focuses on nostalgia, most certainly resembles smack to me."

I’m always, and forever will be about helping other countries. But these wars and fighting are about oil, and strategic placement to acquire oil, which as we all know isn’t a viable energy resource and will be replaced quite rapidly over the next decade or so.
