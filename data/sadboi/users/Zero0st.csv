pics,ffxm9yl,t3_evqrr6,1580328008.0,You got this. It takes time and hard work. I was in the same boat as you. After months if not a year of not wanting to do anything but sleep. I would go to work and then come home and go to sleep I would barely want to talk to my daughter. I finally started doing what you have started and it got better with each day. A little here and there. Fast forward to now I have been promoted and moved to the same city as my daughter so I can be closer to her. You are going to have days were you want to give up. Keep fighting. Keep pushing. If you fall back take a moment to figure out how to get back ahead. You got this!!
