Anxiety,fewb1cu,t3_eqjipy,1579407782.0,"My experiences aren’t the same as yours but I can tell you how I relate and hope that helps in some way: 

Since I developed depression, I’ve had a difficult time playing my instrument. I love it but now playing gives me so much anxiety and I’m filled with horrible thoughts about how I don’t deserve to play such an instrument and that I suck. And when I can get through those thoughts and start to enjoy it, I worry that I’ll feel really down again and loose my love for it (just the worst feeling for me to have something I love ripped away like that because of something I can’t control). 

To handle this and not drive myself even more insane, I’m currently working with my music teacher to make small goals that will get me to my more lofty goals. So right now my goal is just being consistent and observing progress. 

So maybe for you, making small goals will help. I know that may seem annoying (always pisses me off when people say that) but if you can conquer the small stuff, the big stuff doesn’t feel so scary you know?"
aspergers,fbil2yr,t1_fbhx55e,1576904310.0,"I go by this too^^ It’d be cool to be able to seamlessly flirt but honestly I find it easier to flat out said, hey I like you, do you like me? 
I actually started talking to a dude (also asd) and he legit said he loved me within like a few weeks of talking to me. I told him straight up I didn’t know how I felt (it was a bit too soon for me) but we kept talking, gave it time and now we’re going out and have been together for about a year in an LDR. 
So yeah, flirting is nice but blunt honesty can work too :)"
Anxiety,fbidor5,t1_fbfny5q,1576898026.0,"Hey, thanks for the reply. You have a good idea. Doing a big clean  when I have the house to myself and no one to stress me about how slow I’m going makes the process easier.

aspergers,f7zmzov,t1_f7m31oq,1574113096.0,"I see what you’re saying here and how that can be subjective but I think that’s more how other people view someone’s life. I suppose to a doctor trying to diagnose someone, things seem pretty subjective. But for the person going through it, those struggles are real and factual. 
I probably have this opinion because for both depression and ASD stuff, I’ve felt people assumed things about me and my symptoms."
aspergers,f7lzxre,t1_f7kttdt,1573851432.0,"Everyone can experience sadness and feel depressed but that doesn’t mean they HAVE depression. Just like people can experience symptoms of ASD but not have ASD. 
I agree that there is a degree of subjective in that some ASD symptoms overlap with things everyone has experience; however,  the key is whether the symptoms are interfering with everyday life and what the intensity of those symptoms are. In my opinion, this is where we cross the line from hazy subjectivity into facts."

I’m never going to be completely normal and neither are you. It’s not a blanket statement; it’s reality.

Glad I found this post. Makes me feel a little better about panicking over changing a string on my instrument because the little anxious voice in me is saying  “I’m not good enough to play.” It’s ridiculous; logic says just practice and change the string. It’s annoying logic isn’t enough to fix this debilitating anxiety hole. 
But I digress...I Hope everything worked out for you."

I do disagree that this isn’t an accomplishment. Anyone who commits to bettering themselves through education deserves to feel good about it. It’s hard to push yourself to better yourself (especially when dealing with a mental illness) and it’s not cheap (even community isn’t cheap). I have as much respect for someone at a community college as someone that goes to an ivy. Each is trying to better themselves.

It’s just right now, I’m floating in this sea of darkness and everything I liked rarely brings me anything but anxiety anymore. 
I know I’m saying the same thing over and over but I guess that’s why I come on here to talk. I can vent the same circular, dark thoughts and not bother anyone (hopefully)."

Selfhatred,ew3cxmv,t3_cmfrhi,1565072909.0,"I can’t answer the question of what’s wrong but I can relate to some things you’ve said really strongly. 
Some days, I feel absolutely nothing for a guy I’m into and I feel bad because I think he actually likes me. And anytime I have a chance to improve myself or my circumstances (life, career, etc) it’s like I self sabotage. I hate myself so much it seems almost counterintuitive to do something kind for myself. It seems like an oxymoron that someone could actually like me, someone who, by my standards, is incapable of being loved. 

But I heard this advice I’m trying to implement: Find peace with the things you fear. 

Maybe that’ll help you too. Best of luck"

depression,euvdoqx,t3_chj5ux,1564059170.0,"When I was suicidal, I made a pros and cons list about whether to kill myself or not. I also tried to off myself over the obsessive thought that I wasn’t good enough, perpetuated by having a guy tell me he liked me and then promptly taking it back, and therefore deserved to die.  I stopped caring about my family and I didn’t have friends (except the one that ghosted me for his own issues). Clearly I was deep in my own mind and extremely self absorbed. Suicide hotlines are okay but they are just strangers you know? I told myself it was their job to care and that I’d be a bother. 
I would never contact people with the intention of them saving me but I did send a few secret good bye texts (just saying good things about then and that I might not be available for a while). Some of them were more even more transparent. Maybe that could be manipulative but honestly I really believed I was going to kill myself and I thought that was the best idea. 
I see a crap ton of posts on here with people saying they’re gonna off themselves right that second or by some arbitrary date. As a depression subreddit, I don’t see this as manipulative. I see this as someone desperately needing someone to talk to or to relate to or just to be cared for. I don’t see how this post is any different. 
Posting this kind of thing repeatedly would be on the manipulative side but this person seems really sincere and just in a bad place so I don’t foresee that happening. 
Lastly, we’ve all done things when depressed that make us cringe. I’m not as religious as I once was but I do like the saying, let him who is without sin throw the first stone (or however it goes). No one here should be throwing stones as I’m sure we’ve all done something like this. Throwing stones at someone who is hurting is not the answer. What can help is sharing and relating. If you did something you’re not proud of when you went through a really bad depressive dip, call yourself out and lead by example. 
That is all ✌🏽"

I felt so guilty about taking a break from music but it just hurt too much to play with all the negativity surrounding someone I used to be so passionate and driven for. 
I like the idea of taking up a hobby other than music. That plus some professional help might get me back into things."

Not saying it’s the best way to get attention but I can see how someone would get to that point and it must suck immensely. 

Personally, I find myself isolating because I just feel bad for existing and don’t want to bother anyone. Or I want to see if it’ll matter if I die or not.

This life is full of little moments but the big picture just seems so worthless.

It sucks and it’s hard not to compare myself and feel so far behind. I try my hardest to just be mindful and in the moment so I don’t have to engage with those thoughts.  Not sure if that’s just me avoiding things but at least it makes me feel better.

LDR,er761zd,t3_c0pwld,1560568162.0,"Hey, I’m new to long distance too so maybe I can share some of what I’ve learned. 
I’ve only been with my boyfriend for about 4 months (we’ve only known each other for about 6 months and we met online) but we’ve had our share of ups and downs. We both have depression and we’re both in frustrating places in our lives right now so sometimes we can get to each other. 

What’s really helped is communication. 

If he has a lot of work stress and isn’t feeling great, he tells me and I know not to expect to hear from him as much as usual for a bit and try to give him some extra support. 
If I’m frustrated about something and need some space, I tell him straight up that I need space and why and he’s so sweet about understanding. 

Obviously we are not perfect so if we screw up, we apologize and try to move on and learn from it. 

Maybe it’s not the weekends that are the problem but how you guys feel during that time. Whatever you feel, maybe just say that (like I feel tired/frustrated/anxious/etc) and navigate the conversation keeping those feelings in mind. 

Best of luck to you (and PS you sound like a great girlfriend so I wouldn’t worry)."

Hypocritically I’m going to pose something to you: Would you feel the same way about a broken arm? Would you hide a broken arm from your family because they sacrificed so much for you and you don’t want to make trouble? Or would you let them help you utilize the resources they moved to this country for to help you? 

Whenever I feel bad, I try to put it like this and it makes me feel a bit better. All the best to you."
Anxiety,eqahwtx,t3_bxu86p,1559933263.0,"That’s so freaking awesome! Your hard work payed off. I’m so proud of you dude. 
I’m in the place where school is scary right now so hearing that you’ve come so far is really great to hear. Gives me some hope that things might not be like this forever."
depression,eq71trg,t1_eq5kq1t,1559839115.0,Thanks. We’ll see how long I can keep this up.
depression,eq71rx4,t1_eq5mp78,1559839091.0,Thanks. Hope you can do it soon too.
depression,epvkyoq,t3_bw23tp,1559538108.0,"This happens to me. I’ll be happy but it’s like there’s always this black veil lingering in the back of my head ready to consume me again. 

Personally, I find this worse than when I was deep in depression. When I was fully cloaked in depression, I could be angry and sad but I still kept on because I was fighting for me life back. 

Now that I’ve come out enough to actually be happy sometimes, it feels worse in a way. It feels like I’ll never get the life I was fighting for and I’ll spend the rest of my life coping and trying to avoid a downward spiral. And I still have all those thoughts that say I don’t deserve to be happy so I feel guilty for not being the really depressed person I was before and it makes me overthink and I wonder whether I was faking it all along. 

In a word, Ugh."
selfharm,epefyyl,t3_buiuuz,1559182249.0,"Personally I’ve bounced between a lot of reasons for self harming. Sometimes it’s self punishment, other times it’s for emotional pain and sometimes I just really miss the feeling it gives me. Cutting is both a coping mechanism and an addiction. It’s 100% okay to self harm just because you want to do it. There may be an unconscious motive behind it since you mentioned you used it in you SA but there may not be and that doesn’t invalidate you."
selfharm,eolwzkw,t3_bs9rjv,1558677727.0,"Hey, sorry things are rough for you right now. A month is a pretty good amount of time to let any sh injuries heal so don’t worry too much. Also, unless you are in immediate danger, you can just lie about how you got the injury and I’m pretty sure your doctor will believe it. He’ll (or she’ll) probably be more focused on the surgery. 
Also, being clean for a whole year is a great accomplishment. Don’t let one slip up stop you from getting back on the recovery train. Recovery isn’t linear so some slip ups are to be expected. The best thing you can do is learn from this and move on. 
Good luck to you and I hope surgery goes well."
selfharm,eolv0tc,t3_bs5cco,1558676771.0,I started in college when I got depressed 🙃 you aren’t alone
selfharm,eolu644,t3_bsabfm,1558676386.0,"If it makes you feel better, you did make progress. Months ago you would have felt good about hurting yourself but now you feel bad. The fact that you feel sucky about hurting yourself means you are learning healthier cooing strategies and don’t  need to rely on this on as much. 
Remember, recovery isn’t linear. One slip up doesn’t negate all your hard work."
SuicideWatch,eoltt9q,t3_bs7ubh,1558676239.0,"Yes. God, I relate so hard to this."
selfharm,eolt9lx,t3_bsanrp,1558675997.0,"Man that sucks. Sorry you go through this. 
Not sure if you experience what I do but I think I can relate. 
Personally I feel shitty after good things because I pick apart everything I could have done better or I just tell myself that it doesn’t matter because I’m not good enough anyway."
selfharm,eo94ay0,t3_bqv8lt,1558381851.0,"Same thing happened to me when my mom found out about me. Literally cornered me and demanded to see my arms. Pulled up my sleeves and everything. Freaked me out so badly and made me want to hide even more. I don’t really have any privacy anyway because that’s just how it is with my parents but jeez it was rough. 
It’s nice that she cares but it would have been better if she didn’t come at me like I was a criminal. And my mom’s a freaking special ed teacher so I felt extra bad because she’s had to have students with these issues and I know she didn’t handle it like that. 
I just talked with my mom about it and tried to both recognize her concerns and care but also share how I felt. Took me a while to get to that point though and it’s tough if you don’t have a close relationship to begin with. 
I know it probably sucks now but things will get better."
