Anxiety,fewb1cu,t3_eqjipy,1579407782.0,"My experiences aren‚Äôt the same as yours but I can tell you how I relate and hope that helps in some way: 

Since I developed depression, I‚Äôve had a difficult time playing my instrument. I love it but now playing gives me so much anxiety and I‚Äôm filled with horrible thoughts about how I don‚Äôt deserve to play such an instrument and that I suck. And when I can get through those thoughts and start to enjoy it, I worry that I‚Äôll feel really down again and loose my love for it (just the worst feeling for me to have something I love ripped away like that because of something I can‚Äôt control). 

To handle this and not drive myself even more insane, I‚Äôm currently working with my music teacher to make small goals that will get me to my more lofty goals. So right now my goal is just being consistent and observing progress. 

So maybe for you, making small goals will help. I know that may seem annoying (always pisses me off when people say that) but if you can conquer the small stuff, the big stuff doesn‚Äôt feel so scary you know?"
aspergers,fbil2yr,t1_fbhx55e,1576904310.0,"I go by this too^^ It‚Äôd be cool to be able to seamlessly flirt but honestly I find it easier to flat out said, hey I like you, do you like me? 
I actually started talking to a dude (also asd) and he legit said he loved me within like a few weeks of talking to me. I told him straight up I didn‚Äôt know how I felt (it was a bit too soon for me) but we kept talking, gave it time and now we‚Äôre going out and have been together for about a year in an LDR. 
So yeah, flirting is nice but blunt honesty can work too :)"

Doing a big clean  when I have the house to myself and no one to stress me about how slow I‚Äôm going makes the process easier.

I probably have this opinion because for both depression and ASD stuff, I‚Äôve felt people assumed things about me and my symptoms."
aspergers,f7lzxre,t1_f7kttdt,1573851432.0,"Everyone can experience sadness and feel depressed but that doesn‚Äôt mean they HAVE depression. Just like people can experience symptoms of ASD but not have ASD. 
I agree that there is a degree of subjective in that some ASD symptoms overlap with things everyone has experience; however,  the key is whether the symptoms are interfering with everyday life and what the intensity of those symptoms are. In my opinion, this is where we cross the line from hazy subjectivity into facts."

I do disagree that this isn‚Äôt an accomplishment. Anyone who commits to bettering themselves through education deserves to feel good about it. It‚Äôs hard to push yourself to better yourself (especially when dealing with a mental illness) and it‚Äôs not cheap (even community isn‚Äôt cheap).

Selfhatred,ew3cxmv,t3_cmfrhi,1565072909.0,"I can‚Äôt answer the question of what‚Äôs wrong but I can relate to some things you‚Äôve said really strongly. 
Some days, I feel absolutely nothing for a guy I‚Äôm into and I feel bad because I think he actually likes me. And anytime I have a chance to improve myself or my circumstances (life, career, etc) it‚Äôs like I self sabotage. I hate myself so much it seems almost counterintuitive to do something kind for myself. It seems like an oxymoron that someone could actually like me, someone who, by my standards, is incapable of being loved.

depression,euvdoqx,t3_chj5ux,1564059170.0,"When I was suicidal, I made a pros and cons list about whether to kill myself or not. I also tried to off myself over the obsessive thought that I wasn‚Äôt good enough, perpetuated by having a guy tell me he liked me and then promptly taking it back, and therefore deserved to die.  I stopped caring about my family and I didn‚Äôt have friends (except the one that ghosted me for his own issues). Clearly I was deep in my own mind and extremely self absorbed. Suicide hotlines are okay but they are just strangers you know? I told myself it was their job to care and that I‚Äôd be a bother. 
I would never contact people with the intention of them saving me but I did send a few secret good bye texts (just saying good things about then and that I might not be available for a while). Some of them were more even more transparent. Maybe that could be manipulative but honestly I really believed I was going to kill myself and I thought that was the best idea. 
I see a crap ton of posts on here with people saying they‚Äôre gonna off themselves right that second or by some arbitrary date. As a depression subreddit, I don‚Äôt see this as manipulative. I see this as someone desperately needing someone to talk to or to relate to or just to be cared for. I don‚Äôt see how this post is any different. 
Posting this kind of thing repeatedly would be on the manipulative side but this person seems really sincere and just in a bad place so I don‚Äôt foresee that happening. 
Lastly, we‚Äôve all done things when depressed that make us cringe. I‚Äôm not as religious as I once was but I do like the saying, let him who is without sin throw the first stone (or however it goes). No one here should be throwing stones as I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve all done something like this. Throwing stones at someone who is hurting is not the answer. What can help is sharing and relating. If you did something you‚Äôre not proud of when you went through a really bad depressive dip, call yourself out and lead by example.

What‚Äôs really helped is communication. 

If he has a lot of work stress and isn‚Äôt feeling great, he tells me and I know not to expect to hear from him as much as usual for a bit and try to give him some extra support. 
If I‚Äôm frustrated about something and need some space, I tell him straight up that I need space and why and he‚Äôs so sweet about understanding. 

Obviously we are not perfect so if we screw up, we apologize and try to move on and learn from it. 

Maybe it‚Äôs not the weekends that are the problem but how you guys feel during that time. Whatever you feel, maybe just say that (like I feel tired/frustrated/anxious/etc) and navigate the conversation keeping those feelings in mind.

It‚Äôs a weird thing to be frustrated about and I feel bad for thinking that way because I don‚Äôt wanna hurt people but that‚Äôs just how it is right now I guess. 
Sometimes I wish I could get some sort of disease that‚Äôd kill me. I hate thinking like that though. Makes me feel like a bad person."
depression,eqq7iyy,t3_byz6d4,1560214143.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with this pain everyday. 
I can relate to you a bit on this. After some therapy I‚Äôm able to find happiness in the moment but in the inside I still don‚Äôt feel right. Like this dark is still inside me. I don‚Äôt like the things I used to like and I waste days with youtube and Netflix and a bit of part time work sprinkled in until I go back to school. Life has become one big distraction from reality. 
I can feel good in the moment but if someone gave me a gun or other deadly thing, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate. And I don‚Äôt see myself dying any other way than like that, by my own hand."
depression,eqjk4c6,t3_byjnm7,1560106270.0,"I feel bad about depression too. It‚Äôs like, I have such a good life and so much to be appreciative of; why am I like this? 

Hypocritically I‚Äôm going to pose something to you: Would you feel the same way about a broken arm? Would you hide a broken arm from your family because they sacrificed so much for you and you don‚Äôt want to make trouble? Or would you let them help you utilize the resources they moved to this country for to help you? 

Whenever I feel bad, I try to put it like this and it makes me feel a bit better. All the best to you."
Anxiety,eqahwtx,t3_bxu86p,1559933263.0,"That‚Äôs so freaking awesome! Your hard work payed off. I‚Äôm so proud of you dude. 
I‚Äôm in the place where school is scary right now so hearing that you‚Äôve come so far is really great to hear. Gives me some hope that things might not be like this forever."
depression,eq71trg,t1_eq5kq1t,1559839115.0,Thanks. We‚Äôll see how long I can keep this up.
depression,eq71rx4,t1_eq5mp78,1559839091.0,Thanks. Hope you can do it soon too.
depression,epvkyoq,t3_bw23tp,1559538108.0,"This happens to me. I‚Äôll be happy but it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs always this black veil lingering in the back of my head ready to consume me again. 

Personally, I find this worse than when I was deep in depression. When I was fully cloaked in depression, I could be angry and sad but I still kept on because I was fighting for me life back. 

Now that I‚Äôve come out enough to actually be happy sometimes, it feels worse in a way. It feels like I‚Äôll never get the life I was fighting for and I‚Äôll spend the rest of my life coping and trying to avoid a downward spiral. And I still have all those thoughts that say I don‚Äôt deserve to be happy so I feel guilty for not being the really depressed person I was before and it makes me overthink and I wonder whether I was faking it all along. 

In a word, Ugh."
selfharm,epefyyl,t3_buiuuz,1559182249.0,"Personally I‚Äôve bounced between a lot of reasons for self harming. Sometimes it‚Äôs self punishment, other times it‚Äôs for emotional pain and sometimes I just really miss the feeling it gives me. Cutting is both a coping mechanism and an addiction. It‚Äôs 100% okay to self harm just because you want to do it. There may be an unconscious motive behind it since you mentioned you used it in you SA but there may not be and that doesn‚Äôt invalidate you."
selfharm,eolwzkw,t3_bs9rjv,1558677727.0,"Hey, sorry things are rough for you right now. A month is a pretty good amount of time to let any sh injuries heal so don‚Äôt worry too much. Also, unless you are in immediate danger, you can just lie about how you got the injury and I‚Äôm pretty sure your doctor will believe it. He‚Äôll (or she‚Äôll) probably be more focused on the surgery. 
Also, being clean for a whole year is a great accomplishment. Don‚Äôt let one slip up stop you from getting back on the recovery train. Recovery isn‚Äôt linear so some slip ups are to be expected. The best thing you can do is learn from this and move on. 
Good luck to you and I hope surgery goes well."
selfharm,eolv0tc,t3_bs5cco,1558676771.0,I started in college when I got depressed üôÉ you aren‚Äôt alone
selfharm,eolu644,t3_bsabfm,1558676386.0,"If it makes you feel better, you did make progress. Months ago you would have felt good about hurting yourself but now you feel bad. The fact that you feel sucky about hurting yourself means you are learning healthier cooing strategies and don‚Äôt  need to rely on this on as much. 
Remember, recovery isn‚Äôt linear. One slip up doesn‚Äôt negate all your hard work."
SuicideWatch,eoltt9q,t3_bs7ubh,1558676239.0,"Yes. God, I relate so hard to this."
selfharm,eolt9lx,t3_bsanrp,1558675997.0,"Man that sucks. Sorry you go through this. 
Not sure if you experience what I do but I think I can relate. 
Personally I feel shitty after good things because I pick apart everything I could have done better or I just tell myself that it doesn‚Äôt matter because I‚Äôm not good enough anyway."
selfharm,eo94ay0,t3_bqv8lt,1558381851.0,"Same thing happened to me when my mom found out about me. Literally cornered me and demanded to see my arms. Pulled up my sleeves and everything. Freaked me out so badly and made me want to hide even more. I don‚Äôt really have any privacy anyway because that‚Äôs just how it is with my parents but jeez it was rough. 
It‚Äôs nice that she cares but it would have been better if she didn‚Äôt come at me like I was a criminal. And my mom‚Äôs a freaking special ed teacher so I felt extra bad because she‚Äôs had to have students with these issues and I know she didn‚Äôt handle it like that. 
I just talked with my mom about it and tried to both recognize her concerns and care but also share how I felt. Took me a while to get to that point though and it‚Äôs tough if you don‚Äôt have a close relationship to begin with. 
I know it probably sucks now but things will get better."
