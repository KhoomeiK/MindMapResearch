selfharm,fpascjm,t3_gc6t2t,1588454698.0,That is so dang impressive.  Being clean that long during a Pandemic is such a huge step. Way to go!
selfharm,fp9ia8y,t3_gc06ne,1588426913.0,Not irrelevant at all. One month is huge!
selfharm,fp7niba,t3_gbh539,1588374002.0,To sit there with it for hours and not do anything is incredible. I am so impressed and proud!
selfharm,fp6rtuy,t3_gbgtby,1588357506.0,That was such a great idea. I am so proud of you.
selfharm,fp400qg,t3_gaxggb,1588289027.0,"If it helps, I am almost 30, and have been struggling with sh on and off for 15 years. I am always willing to listen and try to help if you need it."
selfharm,fp3ymte,t3_gb3k21,1588288264.0,"I get them in my wrist mostly, and get muscle twitches on my legs by scars. It brings on urges, or makes them worse when it happens. I didn't know other people experienced it too."
selfharm,fp3vaa7,t3_gb13f4,1588286462.0,That made me smile. Rock that harmonica!
selfharm,fot8jys,t1_fot8edi,1588047143.0,I needed that
selfharm,fos7kjw,t1_fos77sh,1588025407.0,Enjoy the better part of your journey. You deserve it.
selfharm,forgnnf,t3_g953e6,1588011911.0,"That is so impressive. I am struggling pretty hard during my clean streak right now. 7 years sounds impossible to me. I am very impressed, congrats!"
selfharm,for9ckb,t1_for90n1,1588008383.0,I really hope that helps. I wish I could help more.
selfharm,for8xkr,t1_for7opm,1588008183.0,"Oh, lucky no lockdown. I really hope the bleeding stops soon.Are you safe?"
selfharm,for7idn,t1_for596m,1588007493.0,"I know most of us are on lockdown, but can you get medical attention?"
selfharm,for4ibe,t3_g9355v,1588006034.0,Did it stop bleeding?
selfharm,foqois0,t3_g91ehf,1587997892.0," A friend once told me that your scars represent battles that you fought with yourself and won. No matter the size, those scars are battles that you got through."
selfharm,foqnwc6,t3_g91emb,1587997547.0,"You accomplished being clean for two years. That takes strength and commitment. None of that is erased. If you can't be proud of yourself right now, know that a stranger who understands is proud of you."
selfharm,foqkpwh,t3_g8trvf,1587995702.0,"I feel this post. I used to hide it, lash out, and lock up with my s.o. I have always found it hard to talk to people who don't self harm because it is a completely different mindset and some people can't understand why we do it. I found it helpful to talk to a friend who used to cut and/or my therapist before talking to my s.o. When calm, I would explain that while they were great questions (Why do you cut, why didn't you just come to me?) I won't always have the answers for him at the time, that sometimes you feel it too much and can't explain it. I needed to figure out what kind of support I needed from him. He has gotten better at reacting in a supportive way when I relapse. Sorry if I rambled. I hope this helps."
selfharm,foqj41d,t3_g8wx5m,1587994726.0,I am so happy for you! I hope you continue to feel this way.
selfharm,foqitun,t3_g8yi88,1587994547.0,"I didn't know how to put the feeling to words, but I think you and these other comments just nailed it. I also go shallow, and feel like I am not struggling enough when I see deeper scars. Like I don't deserve to say I cut."
selfharm,foqiriu,t3_g90q0v,1587994507.0,"For what it's worth, I really hope you don't. Can you reach out to someone?"
selfharm,fopgedc,t1_fopgd1x,1587960809.0,Sure. I'll be up for a bit
selfharm,fopfzdh,t1_fopfnzy,1587960506.0,Sometimes it is hard for someone who doesn't harm to know how to help someone who does. Do you need to talk it through?
selfharm,fopfj77,t3_g8scxr,1587960184.0,You will get there!
selfharm,fopfhvp,t3_g8sgn4,1587960156.0,I am sorry to hear that. Do you have another friend you can talk to?
selfharm,fopff1y,t3_g8t012,1587960101.0,You should definitely feel proud of yourself.  One month is huge.
selfharm,fop6tc3,t3_g8r2lw,1587954364.0,"You did not fail. I know it feels like it, and that your thoughts are telling you that you did, but you stumbled. We all do. This is a pretty messed up year so far, and you coped the way that you know how. I am so sorry to hear that you get bullied for this. I hope you find some support through here. Try to get some rest tonight so you can start over tomorrow."
selfharm,fop4x2o,t3_g8kpyw,1587953158.0,"Since your dad is supportive, can you ask him to help keep you distracted/find another way to cope this week? I am rooting for you, and look forward to hearing what kind of cake you get."
selfharm,fop47yr,t3_g8n8og,1587952719.0,"I feel the same way. My skin is really light, and my veins and scars are quite visible.  I almost always feel uncomfortable and close to relapsing when I look at my wrists. I have found that putting temporary tattoos on my wrists helps to distract/comfort me."
selfharm,fop3wco,t3_g8o0x0,1587952514.0," I am sure that is not how you wanted anyone to find out, so I am glad for you that they are understanding. You are lucky to have that support system, and that you could make an appointment so quickly."
selfharm,fop38io,t3_g8p0we,1587952100.0,Thank you for posting this. I'm glad you were able to fight your thoughts. This gave me hope.
selfharm,fop2kf5,t3_g8pwqx,1587951680.0,"I have lost count of how many clean streaks I have broken, but I remember the shame and guilt spirals I would fall into. I don't know if I can write a reply that will help you, but I hope that tomorrow is better. I hope that you can forgive yourself and know that you are not weak. I am glad you did not cut your wrist. For now,  that is a small win."
selfharm,fop1vat,t3_g8qroy,1587951241.0,"I'm glad you have a support system.  Congrats on 2 weeks! Remember whatever got you through 2 weeks, and hold onto that as you get to 3. :)"

selfharm,fonty19,t1_fonpvds,1587926401.0,It helps to know someone else gets that rush feeling.  It's definitely an addiction.
selfharm,fonteti,t3_g8iva3,1587926105.0,"There have been different reasons over the past 15 years, but I think it comes down to a couple of things. I have anxiety, depression, and have anxiety and panic attacks. The pain will ground me if I am too much in my head, too low, or trapped in panic. It kind of snaps me back to reality if that makes sense. The pain gives me that runners high feeling, and honestly feels like a release from the emotional pain. At times it has been for a sense of control, as a punishment, or because I just felt like I was missing it."
StopSelfHarm,fonlb6f,t3_g8a86b,1587921685.0,"I wish I had the right words for you right now. I have been struggling with some strong urges, and just keep using distraction techniques until I am too drained and can fall asleep.  Sometimes making something, or deciding to not talk help me feel like I am in control.  2 years shows you have incredible strength even though it doesn't always feel like it. Sorry if this rambled, I just wanted to make sure you knew you are not alone."
StopSelfHarm,fonk4l6,t3_g81p04,1587921024.0,I am so proud of you. That is a huge step in recovery. Here's to more dress days!

selfharm,fo17m79,t1_fo16v6u,1587427394.0,"I have had that similar mindset. I compare what I did to what I could have done instead. For the self harm addicted brain though, pain is pain. I hope you are able to find another way to cope. Stay safe."
selfharm,fo16izy,t3_g53pwv,1587426759.0,That is a huge accomplishment! I hope you find something to do tomorrow.
selfharm,fo15cal,t3_g50asl,1587426067.0,"I have struggled with this often. For me, scratching is an easier way to self harm, and has become like a reflex. The goal would be to not hurt yourself at all, but we both know that isn't so easy all the time. I would be proud that you didn't do more damage to yourself. I do suggest reaching out to your support system if you have one. I'm rooting for you."
