ZeroEscape,fqufkko,t3_gkz1y3,1589658070.0,"So basically

Akane was Zero the whole time. At least, the Zero of this Nonary game. She set the whole thing up so that Junpei would be in the situation he was in at the True ending. This was so that she could ensure that she existed, since she was in a Song of Storms paradox. The young her lived because the older her set up the second Nonary game, letting her live to set it up. 

The whole thing about Seven lying is implied, but if the implications are true, the man never had amnesia. He just made it up so that he could dilute memories to Junpei without having to reveal *everything* if he was asked further questions. 

One really cool detail in the game is Akane's fevers. She gets them whenever you go down (or are about to go down) a route that would lead to anything but the good ending, since in anything but the good ending the past her burns up. 

All of the Nonary Game members were gathered up for a specific reason. Ace was brought there so that Gentarou could pay for his crimes. Snake was brought there because he has morphogenetic resonance, which would further boost Junpei's when the time came. The same can be said about Clover. Santa was brought along to be a further help to Akane, and to ""kidnap"" her in the end. Akane was brought to further help morphogenetic resonance, as Junpei's powers are stronger than hers, and for the many, many times she needs to do little things. Seven was brought along because Akane saw him in the furnace when she was a kid, and needed to replicate that. Additionally, Seven knew about this plan all along and volunteered to help save Akane's life in this way. The ninth man was brought along for similar reasons to Gentarou. Lastly, Lotus is the most confusing one to have been brought along. But, her kids were part of the initial nonary games. In addition, she had the computer knowledge to get through the 7th? Door, and then it just comes down to ""Akane saw her as a kid, in the furnace"""

His plan is to use SHIFTing to send his consciousness back to when he was in his 20s, go to the base where Radical-6 broke out, and try to prevent it. 

Meanwhile, the consciousness of his 20s is over there on the moon doing the Ambidex game in order to be able to hone his powers enough to be able to switch back once the time is right. It's there that he learns that his timeline has technically already failed, and is given his mission to learn about Robotics and Genetics.
