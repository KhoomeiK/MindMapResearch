You could also get infections through your mucus membranes and body openings. If your eyes are under the soil they would probably be quite vulnerable.

If there is a lot of moisture in the soil it could also cause damage to your skin cells as they absorb water, expand, and slough off. Especially if you start to get sores from the constant pressure on your skin. 

I don't know how long this would take if you were fed and hydrated during this time. If you weren't you'd probably die of dehydration pretty quickly. If you were given water to drink and didn't get sepsis you could suffer for quite some time with lots of wounds and rotting flesh but it would be nasty.

Being part of a group is a matter of survival for many people and people do unethical things in order to survive. 

It sounds like unless she was ready to go no contact with them she would have to lie about lots of things to avoid judgement and harassment from her family. If she loves her family and they are her support system, going no contact is not an easy thing to do.

NotionSo,fi3fjy0,t1_fi36p53,1582116044.0,"So to clarify, if I want a relation to be visible on both entries, I should do a two way sync. If the items are in the same database, it will show two columns so the direction of the sync is visible. On the entry itself, it will be visible if any other entries have been linked to it.

If I only sync one way, there will only be one column and I wont know just by looking at an entry that anything else has been synced to it.

Is that right?"
