ChoosingBeggars,fbz0a3n,t3_ef5fnh,1577231256.0,"I had a very similar situation when I was 20. She wanted a 250$ pair of UGGs. Which I could not afford. She loved zebras so my mom helped me get her a beautiful zebra picture that was framed and my uncle took it at our local zoo to match her bathroom. I also got her a pair of leather boots and a 2DS so she could play Pokemon with me. She ABSOLUTELY through a fit crying throwing stuff at my. Screaming ""why couldn't you just get what I wanted."" And ""can we just return everything and get the UGGs I wanted"" and even had her mom text me to call me a price of shit because I didn't get her what she ""wanted/deserved"" we both made minimum wage and I got what I could afford. We broke up shortly after. RUN IM TELLING YOU RUN. As someone who has been through it, just get out. I would feel so disrespected like I have in the past."

BreakUps,facfv23,t3_e8gfve,1575938695.0,"Bro I quit my job cuz I couldn't deal with the pain. Not saying that's a good idea for you, but take some time off. Play some video games. Maybe go for a run, drink some water. You gotta let it run its course. It's ok to be in the shits for a bit. You need to make time for you, if you need a week, take a week. You will not be productive trying to force productivity or focus. If your mind isn't in the right spot, take some days for you. Time will tell, but you can't rush it. Do what you can to keep your mind focused at work/school. Drink water and go for a run. It will help.

BreakUp,fabwk8m,t3_e8gj7n,1575929962.0,"Your not wrong with anything you say. I feel the same way. In my eyes and how women have used me in past relationships, it seems like they (boy or girl) need their S.O. for emotional support, then when they are happy and dandy, I get broken up with. And now myself and others are left with the bullshit baggage of feeling unwanted, useless, etc. And threads like this exist. I see no point to relationships. You are totally justified in having expectations. It's a 2 way street. I see people in relationships that treat each other like shit. To the point of abuse in the male and female end of things. It makes me so mad. I think dating in my mid 20s is an absolute joke. Just be yourself, enjoy your family, and friends. Relationships are not worth the extent that people are willing to take from you and give nothing in return then leave you in the dust like you never meant shit to them. Oh and let's not forget always being there for someone, then they leave you run around and talk badly behind your back like you did nothing for them."

BreakUp,f9hrt9t,t3_e51v5n,1575320488.0,"Damn, it's wild how dating works these days. Like you can't even call it a relationship anymore because, to me, it always seems like the S.O. has a problem putting a label on something and actually being committed. I'm sorry to hear about this, but you will be better off without something toxic like that in your life. NO ONE and I repeat NO ONE should be going on dates with other people, if they are in a relationship and already committed to it not being an open one. Not sure how your handling things but I recommend taking some time to enjoy being single. I find it so hard for people in my area to put a label on our relationship. I'm 25 and it's happened with the last 3 girls I have been with. I wanted to have a closed relationship they said ok, few weeks later finding out they where going in dates with other people. It hurt. People today have a hard time being committed and just want attention from someone new all the time. Maybe my mind will change one day, but for now, that's my view on women in relationships. Just remember, you are worth more than that."

I don't often go to bars in my home town since it's all college kids and expensive drinks. But I'm into craft brews and tasting new things. I'm an introvert so getting out for me can be a struggle. So more calm scenes tend to be my vibe. I do not enjoy the dance club type of culture."

I need to quit my job because she's an employee here too. I can not deal with this. The thought of here being here happy at work while I'm a disaster is fucking with my head. I have no other job leads I just feel stuck. I want to scream, I want to cry, I want her back. I want her to tell me I'm her best friend again. Not just tell me she thinks things have changed. I promised her I'd always be there. But when she put me in a position like this, I don't know what to do. It's not like I can talk to her about how I feel. I'm heart broken. How am I just supposed to make it seem like everything is okay when it's not. I can't fake it. I'm a mess. My co manager came in today and litterally looked at me and said your vibe is off.
