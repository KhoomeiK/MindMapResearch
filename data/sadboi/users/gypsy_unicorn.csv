And when I do I am sweaty, and nauseous, and dizzy and exhausted. I HATE IT!  I want to move north so badly! I'm originally from Northern Illinois. Also lived on Long Island and in Vermont. LOVE winter!
My heat intolerance has gotten a lot worse since I started getting Fibromyalgia symptoms about 3 years ago."

Nah, you can keep your coke. Although, I do hear IV coke is pretty rad. Meh"

depression,f2ej03d,t1_f2drojd,1570196619.0,"The suicide rate is so damn high! It's ridiculous that in 2019 that there is even an issue! I was reading that AMA with some lady (lol) and they were talking about how the government wont give money to fund intern programs for college students in the psychology field. So there are people going to school but they can't get out there and work in the field without a certain amount of hours. So their degree is useless! And Medicaid and insurance companies make it a huge hassle for doctors with all the paperwork required to see patients and get paid. This country is so shitty in regards to healthcare and it's the most important things for a human, THEIR HEALTH! 
I did read about  ketamine treating depression but I didn't see this derivative. So 8nstead of just using ketamine they created a derivative instead? And its shit huh? I'll have to read up on that. Interesting."
depression,f2dr88r,t1_f2908o6,1570162140.0,"Well we all know about the pharmaceutical industry and what they're about. Also, doctors who don't educate theirselves on current studies. That infuriates me! Like, with Cymbalta (duloxetine) withdrawal and how they're clueless about it. 
But this article states that antidepressants are only supposed to be a short term solution. Which I never knew. 
I did know, through personal experience, that some people (me) don't respond to the majority of them. I had a DNA test done for a depression study and it shows what antidepressants work or don't work based on that information. 
I need to find my copy of it though. I've tried about 7 of them and none have helped. Duloxetine made me a emotionless zombie and I thought I was going to die trying to wean off of it following my doctor's advice. Finally found an online group and learned about bead counting."

Diverticulitis,ewzhrdo,t1_ewtlla2,1565895983.0,"Gave me IV fluids and some kind of lame pain med. A script for cipro and flagyl, again. I should have told them no to that but just wanted out of there. The doctor was super weird. He was trying to like bend my legs at the hip and I was like  'Nooo! I have sciatica really bad!' And then, as he walks by, he kicks the bed really hard. I was like, wtf? And he said he wanted to see if it hurt me, thinking maybe it was my appendix. Super weird."
cymbalta,ewrl5gt,t3_cpl4z7,1565708042.0,Would not advise it. Brain zaps and gut wrenching sobbing for no reason was not fun. I alternated days as per my drs advice. Lasted 4 days and went directly to counting beads. 6 months and I was done with it forever!

depression,ewr47k7,t3_cpidz8,1565693731.0,"I have been in my current house for almost 18 years and I HATE it. I live in Florida and I cannot wait to get out. There are many reasons why I haven't left, mainly money and family. I was born and raised in the midwest and I miss the seasons and the oldness of it. I've also had the opportunity to live in the mountains and I feel that's where I belong. I have depression,  and  being in Florida makes it harder. I can't tolerate the heat because of fibromyalgia and I am trapped inside from may to December. I miss being outside. They say moving won't solve your problems. If you are unhappy where you are, you aren't going to magically be happy somewhere else. I call bullshit."
Diverticulitis,ewpzks7,t1_ewpb0k0,1565653133.0,"Flagyl and cipro are evil! As I'm sure you figured out reading up on them online. 
I was diagnosed with diverticulitis at 47. Haven't had any huge issues from it except after I was taking kratom for pain for about 9 months. The kratom was working great for my pain (I also have fibromyalgia and IBS-D) but I stopped taking it because I thought I was going to die. 3 days of vomiting and diarrhea and excruciating pain. Finally went to the ER. The doctor had no idea what kratom was. ðŸ™„ That's the only thing I can attribute that attack to. Unless some sesame seeds in a salad did it. But I doubt it."

Last time I got a 2 points for $20, first bowl was ok but burned up quick! 2nd bowl turned reddish black, tasted like shit and made me gag! No euphoria, barely felt it and it just made me pissed off. AND it's more expensive then driving about 30-40 minutes for better shit for cheaper!"

mentalhealth,etw6ndi,t3_cdmflb,1563255968.0,There is a huge need for access to mental health services in this country. That goes right along with regular health care. Low income people cannot get the help they need. I believe there are around 19 states who have chosen not to expand their Medicaid program. Why?

The only thing I can get my hands on right now is pills which I dont even really like taking. Drug of choice is any type of amphetamines. Hard to acquire with no money. So it doesnt help much hahah
