This podcast will kill you, 2 ladies called erin who are into disease epidemiology discuss things like prions, malaria, Ebola, the plague etc. If you like biology and diseases and stuff this is great and ofc theyve done a deep dive into covid19

Stuff you should know covers so many types of subjects and I've learnt really interesting stuff about things I would ordinarily not give 2 shits about but I'm glad I listened because it ended up being fascinating! Start off with their 'selects' episodes probably."

Hey that's awesome progress, twice a week is great work. On my bigger taper I think I went down 250mg every 3 days. Recently tho I found I'd drop too fast and have an absolute shit of a day and would have to go back up and stabilise constantly, it was actually hard work, and I thought once I was under 500mg it would be even easier, but it seems the other way around.

And it's not psychological either (I hope!), because some days I actually plain forget taking my dose! 

 My memory is almost complete blanks sometimes where hours are missing, like I've had a benzo bender. Isolation doesnt help with that either. 
I'm just cranky, kinda hot and cold, bit of trouble sleeping, no motivation or energy, brain fog and jello brain, feeling off, everything is just not quite right. I truly cannot remember if I took some on Wednesday or not, I definitely didn't yesterday and I haven't today so far.  Its 9pm where I am, I know it has a big lag effect so I'll check in tomorrow, and then a few days after that. (If I dont give in and take a bit)
