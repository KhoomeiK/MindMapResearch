CPTSD,fpd1hf1,t3_gcm7f5,1588517805.0,"I think the saying can be true for some parents, especially those that were neglectful instead of outright (intentionally) abusive.   


I have friends that went through some really harrowing experiences in their childhood due to their parents' abuse. That wasn't just a case of ""not realizing,"" it was intentional evil.  


My father, on the other hand, was neglectful because he was sick. His untreated, severe bipolar disorder made it impossible for him to care for us properly. He was either too depressed to buy food, didn't have money for food because he couldn't work, or was so manic he sold all of our belongings to buy some model trains and... no food. He wasn't intentionally neglectful, he was just so wrapped up in his own issues he didn't really consider me as someone he had to care for. (Mom was also neglectful for ignoring the problem and not recognizing it as such.)   


I'm really sorry you're feeling upset by this. I don't think your friend is in the wrong, though. I think she might just be misguided on what is helpful vs what isn't. She's trying to stay positive,  and as infuriating as it is sometimes, please don't try and dull that shine."

There's an obvious bias against mental health in the health field. If you're not crippled by your illness then you can't be suffering as much as the person who's full time disabled by theirs. Why would you attempt suicide if you've made a happy little family and pay your bills on time? Only those at their absolute lowest would do something that drastic, right? smh

One of them is showing signs of early bipolar, which is terrifying to me as his mother, but we're navigating it well with the mental health system. He's getting all kinds of supports that I never got at that age.   


Stability is incredibly important when raising a family. You have to be very in tune with your changing moods. You need to see a psychiatrist on a regular basis and be strictly med compliant. I was raised with a bipolar father that refused medications and it really fucked with my upbringing. He was an awful dad because he didn't care enough about his mental health to care for MY health (he's dead now, in part due to his bipolar depression.) I'd say that for me, remaining stable is one of my highest priorities because it allows me to be the best mother I can be.   


You'll need to have a backup plan for when things go south for you or your partner. Will there be family supports you can lean on? Friends? What about finances... if you accidentally fuck them up, what will happen? Will your children have a roof over their heads, food, health care? These are hard questions to ask because we always think OF COURSE THEY WILL, but we know what bipolar can do to us and the people around us.. we need a plan in case we can't take care of it ourselves."
