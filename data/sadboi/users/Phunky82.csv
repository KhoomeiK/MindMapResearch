benzodiazepines,fqzoia9,t3_glp43b,1589771770.0,My first time trying taking the clam.  Took .25 mg and few beers.  Feeling nice but not overly messed up.  A hit of my pen and feeling great.

benzodiazepines,fqozv3l,t3_gk4l1j,1589530072.0,"I’ve been on benzos for the past 8-9 years...  I have some trouble with memory but I’ve also suffered a few TBIs so it’s tough to say what causes it.  Nothing terrible but I have a hard time with names and new faces if I see them in a different environment out of context it takes me a while to remember how I know them...

Also, if I don’t fill my script or run out early I go through noticeable withdrawals which can be hell.  I went on vacation to the Dominican rep and left my script at home so the trip was pretty rough..  I’m pretty sure I had a seizure in my sleep one night which my bf confirmed...

I am currently taking less than what I’m prescribed and plan on dropping my dose down over a span of time.  I’d like to be off of them by next year."

benzodiazepines,fqgl6yg,t3_girzt4,1589349273.0,"Also, if doesn’t hurt to have some etizolam on hand if you find yourself in this situation again.  It Will help get you through any withdrawals until you can refill your rx.  Use sparingly, but it’s another way to stave off withdrawals if you have a few days of wd until you can refill. Best of luck!  You got this!"
benzodiazepines,fqgkk03,t1_fqgjs3f,1589348763.0,"It can’t hurt.. we had about a 15 min convo about how being forced to stay home, in a small apartment  has left me more alone in my head, worried about my health (underlying condition of asthsma) and job uncertainty - and its basically causing agoraphobia.   He was all for the increase, but hoping to drop down once life returns to moral.  Definitely give it a shot, any dr worth keeping understands this unprecedented time is really affecting people’s mental health.  Good luck, sending happy thoughts your way."

Worth a shot."

Drink 5% beers but don’t  pound them and it should help with some of the creepy crawlies and anxiety, also magnesium helps with relaxing your muscles.

benzodiazepines,fpmn3oe,t3_gec6ze,1588736771.0,Four days?  You should be fine.  If you did doses that high for a month you’d have some issues.  Take some time off to reset your tolerance.  Ps congrats on the good work at school!

I’ve lived in four states in the last ten years and each time I’ve moved the new psych has always taken my word and prescribed whatever I’ve needed.  (Ssris, adderall and Ativan.). Maybe I’ve just gotten lucky but I’ve never provided any kind of back up documentation.   I think a lot of drs are more worried about the opioid epidemic than mess with a mental patient whose stable on their current meds."
