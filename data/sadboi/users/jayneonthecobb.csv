My best advice is to keep the “broad stroke” skills that you’ve attained at GS (deductive troubleshooting, Google-Fu) and forget everything else. Especially if it’s enterprise IT there’s almost nothing similar in terms of actual fixes. Businesses normally deal with networking and server-side issues. But, you do know how to triage and issue spot, which is basically the help desk role. Approach every shift with beginner-mind. Ask lots of questions. Good luck!"
