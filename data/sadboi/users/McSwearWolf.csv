I think you‚Äôre right though; some of it is insecurity... maybe they also get so comfortable, the ‚Äúwooing‚Äù stops. I‚Äôm concerned though; partner and I are both still in our thirties. By 45-50, I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôll have cobwebs on my vagina, and we can just clear those off  2 nights a month to have sex for approximately 20 minutes - light fondling followed by me on top, followed by him on top, and then a 30 minutes of Netflix.

It‚Äôs basic vanilla sex almost every time, and I regretfully admit I‚Äôm initiating sex less and less because I just feel like every move, position change, kiss, etc. has been mapped out beforehand. I try to spice things up and he usually *kinda* tries to go with it , but he never tries anything new on his own accord. There is no novelty. There are no surprises. It‚Äôs nearly always the exact same sex. And it doesn‚Äôt seem to bother him at all. Sigh... I know some around here have it much worse, but just wanted to say you are not alone.

offmychest,fpkf18s,t3_gdviig,1588693498.0,"Hi. I grew up with a little bit of money at times, but my parents were into drugs and alcohol and basically quit even trying to raise my sister and I about halfway through childhood. I relate to so much of what you wrote. I put myself through college and even grad school but it hasn‚Äôt helped as much as I thought it would because I missed so much ‚Äúbasic life skills training‚Äù during my formative years. In fact, I was severely traumatized and pretty much mentally ill from growing up in total chaos. I didn‚Äôt even get a foothold until 30. Too late, as you said. Or at least, it sure feels like I was too late. Hey though, I don‚Äôt know how much this helps, but if this quarantine teaches us anything, it‚Äôs that people like us are made to survive hard times. It‚Äôs in our DNA man! Additionally, I recently made it a point to do three small (but big) things that have helped me tremendously with envy and regret: (1) delete all social media / end relationships that make you feel less than, (2) think of one thing you are grateful for each day and write it down, (3) study wealth building; begin to change your circumstance by just taking any action consistently. For example, I was vaping once or twice a month (I don‚Äôt drink or drug but I would buy a disposable one on the weekends thinking I needed a vice haha) and that was adding up to like $240 a year so I quit and put that extra tiny bit of money into cryptocurrency and started learning more about investing. Did I get rich? No. Lol. But I felt like I was taking back some of my power by continuing to learn and have faith in my future. We are still young. No one has it all figured out. I‚Äôve worked for billionaires and some of them are flat out miserable humans. Keep your chin up ok? I hope this didn‚Äôt sound preachy. I know you can keep going. Hugs

They shouldn‚Äôt have done it, but I had dared to look away for 2 minutes, and it happens, and everyone was fine. She literally told me if I were her nanny, she would fire me. Points to me for looking young enough to be the nanny hahaha... sigh... this kind of thing just does not happen to the dads at the park. Ever."
breakingmom,fmjlqvj,t1_fmeq5yp,1586132865.0,"This is the exact shit going on at the non-profit I work for. I‚Äôm glad to still have a job but waiting on my marching orders any day because I have a vagina! I‚Äôm totally expendable to them! At previous place of work it was basically the same. Two tyrannical men overseeing a bunch of women and constantly giving themselves raises and going on lavish business trips while their wives stayed at home and raised kids. Job before THAT was me as a nanny, college student, and Lyft driver ... one night a passenger said to me, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe your husband lets you drive Lyft at night, you should be at home with your kids.‚Äù Smh. So sick of it all."
breakingmom,fmjlcnr,t1_fmdujny,1586132637.0,"Are you me? My previous director at work came into the department, fired or laid off each and every woman under him, including my boss who had been a manager for TWENTY-FIVE years, then hired two of his less qualified friends from college to replace us. Luckily, I was offered a position in another department, but every promotion I have applied for has been ignored and in my place, a middle-aged or older white male is hired. Some with qualifications some not. I have a masters degree. None of them do. Not one. I‚Äôm now working for the only female director at the non-profit but when I looked into her a bit to see what her education and experience was, it turns out her father was a state senator, and I can‚Äôt help but wonder if he didn‚Äôt make a large donation and Bam! She had the position. It‚Äôs really depressing honestly. Every time I see ex director I want to punch him in his smug little face."
breakingmom,fmj2a94,t3_fvj48g,1586121588.0,I don‚Äôt hate it at all. I work in a cubicle and it makes me feel like crap - M-F being trapped in my stupid cube listening to ditzy co-worker w/ her cutsie baby talk to her boyfriend. No more of that for a while! So awesome!

Joke was on people telling me to sleep when the baby sleeps because the first three family members that tried to babysit for me all admitted they were ALSO in tears by the end. One was SIL who only had him 3 hours! I came home to her sobbing, baby screaming, and my BIL trying to feed, rock, and calm both of them. Lol"

breakingmom,flc3esa,t1_fl2rkg4,1585018899.0,"That was my thought as an urban mamma after reading OP‚Äôs comment. I totally understand what she is saying, but I‚Äôm guessing she doesn‚Äôt live in a large city. My family has a wee bit more space being in a house over an apartment, but it‚Äôs not easy. Some of the parents around me have 2 or 3 kids in like 900 square feet with no yard. Anyone who keeps kids inside a tiny space like that for more than a couple days is superhuman. I‚Äôve been taking my kiddo to the playground, we just try to stay off the equipment and stay in the grass. Best I can do!"

Also, next time H pulls me aside to show me one of his dumb Twitter memes while he‚Äôs supposedly working and can‚Äôt be disturbed I will legit go psycho."
