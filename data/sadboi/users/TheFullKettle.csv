In my opinion, if you're not cutting too deep it isn't as big a problem as what's making you cut. And I know I can't force you to do anything and what I'm saying is just words, but I think the most important thing to do is to focus on the root cause of this.

I know you probably hear this all the time and you're probably sick of it but if you want to stop self harming I've heard loads of good stuff about the app ""I am sober"". and I know not everyone deals with it the same way but when I get urges I usually write or doodle to express my feelings instead. or sometimes I chop up paper since it gives me control but isn't harming me in any way.

I know life must be pretty shit for you to feel like suicide is the only way out, and I'm sorry you feel like this. Even though we don't know each other and will likely never cross paths, I still care about you so much. I am fully aware of how that could come across as meaningless and empty but I 100% mean it. If you were to die I would be broken. Completely and utterly broken. The lives of others are the only reason I am still living and when someone ends their life because they can't deal with the pain it breaks my heart. The number of people who I've spoken to on the subreddit who probably went on to kill themselves anyway hurts me. I think about them pretty much every day. And I don't want you to become one of those people. The rare times someone survives or decides not to carry out their plan are the happiest moments of my life. I want more than anything for you to decide to give life another go. I wish there was more I could do. If I knew you in real life I would do anything I could to stop you. But I don't so I can't. In the end, it all comes down to you, but please know that there are people here for you, there is support online and hotlines.

I totally get not wanting to talk to your family about this. It's really fucking hard. I know it is. I know the current global situation is making everything more complicated as well, but please reach out to someone. You deserve help.

I would strongly recommend not to, but in the end I can't force you not to, so if you decide to please do it somewhere that isn't too dangerous.

You may not want to be called a hero, but I do appreciate you, not because I'm glad the shops are continuing business but because you are basically forced to keep working and are still managing to be polite to the selfish customers.

I still eat around normal amounts of food, but if I didn't still live with my parents I'm not sure that would be the case. Right now I keep trying to tell myself that I'm underweight and should be thinking about gaining weight, but I keep thinking I can't let it get past 40. I feel guilty after I eat more than I need to. I never cared about my weight until a few years back when I went to the gym with my friends and we weighed ourselves and I was lighter than them even though I was taller.

Anxiety,fijsmxh,t1_fijqqvf,1582462580.0,"Wow, that's really tough. I rely on my mum so much and don't know what I'd do without her, even though she doesn't always understand. Your mum sounds great, and I'm sure she is still open to giving advice whenever. Just give her a call, I know it's not the same, but it'll still feel better to talk to her. Hope things get better soon, and please don't hesitate if you need someone to talk to, I'm always here to listen :)"
Anxiety,fijsc49,t3_f87w00,1582462259.0,"Hey Lucas, I'm also 15, and I'm from the UK. Reading this made me really sad because your situation is so similar, and I would never wish what I'm dealing with upon anyone. Just like you, I have not been diagnosed with depression or anxiety, but I'm pretty sure I have it. I've been to doctors about it, and they referred me to a counsellor but they rejected me. I don't do anything with my life, I don't leave the house unless it's absolutely essential. I can't even bring myself to leave my room for long, because then I'll get really anxious, and feel sick and sweaty and I'll have to leave immediately. My parents are still together, but they fight a lot and I think if we had more money they would probably be divorced. I don't think they love each other, they just stay together for the sake of their children. Neither of them has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder, but I do think my mum might be dealing with depression, probably as a result of all the members of my family closing themselves off. My dad never leaves his bed unless he has to, but that's probably just because he's exhausted from working so much. I've also had intrusive thoughts, and they are so scary. I don't know how to get rid of them either, just as long as you keep reminding yourself they are just intrusive thoughts you should be ok. I also did the same kind of things when I was younger, and still do now, although mine are more like ""If you don't tap this object 100 times, or watch this 5 times etc someone's going to die"". I don't have a clue what I'm going to do with my life either, I'm too scared to go after my dreams, and I won't get into a normal job because I don't have the ability to focus or the motivation to work. I have a great friendship group, but I feel so different to them sometimes, like if I open up more they won't want to be friends with me anymore. I hate my life and myself too, even though I have it better than so many other people, and I don't know what caused all this. It's scary how similar our situations are. Sorry, this is so long, but I want to show you that you aren't alone and if you want to talk I'm always here for you. Please feel free to message me anytime :)"
Anxiety,fijqous,t3_f880mt,1582460396.0,"I've had intrusive thoughts a couple of times without knowing what they were and just thought I was a psychopath, but I've done a bit more research and discovered that they are actually very common in those suffering from mental health disorders, so it was probably linked to my anxiety. Try and stop smoking weed for a bit to see if that helps at all if it does maybe try and permanently stop. If they still don't stop you probably shouldn't stress about it too much, they happen to everyone, as long as you don't think about them too much, or feel like you're actually going to act upon them."
Anxiety,fijq7zg,t3_f882p4,1582459836.0,"Hey, I know you posted this an hour ago so I don't know if you still want to talk to someone, but if you do I care, and I'm here to listen."
Anxiety,fijq13b,t3_f88j4a,1582459609.0,"I also struggle differentiating anxiety from actual medical issues sometimes too. I do always feel on edge much more in the morning, and I've actually missed a lot of school thinking that it was an actual medical issue, just for it to calm down a couple of hours later. I'm not sure about the increased heart rate since I don't have any way of determining my heart rate, but I'm pretty sure if I did it would be higher in the mornings. Anyway, I'm sorry I can't be much more help, hope you find an answer soon, and your anxiety improves :)"

Anxiety,fi4s4rb,t1_fi2fjr8,1582147351.0,"I guess I am still young, I turned 15 pretty recently. I've talked to my parents about it before and I went to a doctor about it, and they referred me to a counsellor, but they rejected me because obviously people have it worse than me. My school has a counselling service, but I'd feel uncomfortable going to that because of the setting, and the teachers I'd have to speak to first. I feel really guilty talking about anxiety because I haven't actually been diagnosed, so I feel like I shouldn't be allowed to talk about it until it's confirmed. I really want to get help and get better, otherwise I know it's just going to get worse. I just don't know how to make that step, because my parents are so insistent on me attending the school's counselling. I just don't think I would feel totally comfortable opening up in that environment, but if it ends up being my only option I guess I'd just have to go for it. Thank you for your reply, it really means a lot that someone would take time out of their day to read my post, and help me, whilst opening up about their own experience."
Anxiety,fi4r1ri,t1_fi277wa,1582146745.0,"I honestly don't know what I would do if I was in your situation either since I don't know what to do in mine, but I think you should really try and focus on yourself more. Do whatever you feel comfortable doing, but also try and push yourself a little bit, start small though. Maybe do some more things you love, whatever that is, painting, writing etc. The things you love will really get you through hard times, for me it's music and writing. But seriously, if you need someone to talk to I'm always here, obviously I don't know exactly what you're going through since I'm still 15, but I'll try. Don't give up, it will be ok, hold out through the bad times and the good times will follow <3"

Anxiety,fi215ys,t3_f5zh40,1582069123.0,"Well done! That's an amazing achievement, I know how hard it can be. I've not gone anywhere more than a mile and a half away from my house in months. Even though I've not gone far, it's still hard, and the times I do go out I actually prefer to go alone. It gives me time to think, and if my anxiety gets suddenly worse (which happens a lot) I feel more comfortable when I'm not with others (I know that's not the case for many people)"
SuicideWatch,fhuusrf,t3_f4q5ee,1581890428.0,"To everyone who sees this, I love you and you're not alone, ever. That's pretty much all I wanted to say except that it will be ok, and one day you'll find other reasons to live, and you'll want to live. You're all so brave, and so strong if you need someone to talk to, or just vent to I'm always here. I really mean that <3"
