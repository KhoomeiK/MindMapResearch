Personally, if I didn‚Äôt scroll down more to see the graphic pushing the stay at home button (which I found this graphic to be great) I would have thought it was a spam site. I guess I shouldn‚Äôt say a ‚Äúspam site‚Äù but it kinda just makes things look cheap  / less inviting. 

Also I would try adding more ways for authentication. As it is right now, I would have absolutely no way to join as I don‚Äôt use those websites.

Other than that, I think it‚Äôs pretty solid and a nice idea for people to participate in. I do like how it shows peoples‚Äô streaks and such."
