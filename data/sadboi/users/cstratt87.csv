AnorexiaNervosa,fi30p4z,t3_f659x2,1582095761.0,She honestly looks like a small person who is fit.   She has muscle tone.  You don't see her collar bone sinking in.  She looks like what I want to look like.  Downvote me all you want.  Or do I have a problem I am not recognizing? I am obviously suspecting it by being in here.  But to me that woman is perfect and what I strive to look like.
tifu,fhq8hvk,t3_f4aelf,1581800626.0,Was this Oklahoma Wesleyan? I have a hunch it is.  That is one special place.  You did nothing wrong. Sex education needs to be taught. That is how kids wind up pregnant or with an STI.
flying,fhilz36,t3_f3ecyy,1581627341.0,"You could utilize your flight experience for a career in environmentalism.  For example, pilots are used for wildlife counts , fire fighting , and even mapping the ice flows in the Arctic! You could take some classes directed for game and fish departments and get those certificates and wind up with a really cool job! There was even a super cool job a few years back finding polar bears that was done through Intel! Good luck in whatever you do! 

Blue skies!"

insaneparents,fgte719,t1_fgt8ikp,1581103218.0,I grew up in Rapid! Crazy place man.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fclaru4,t1_fcl9hkk,1577743529.0,You are correct! I didn't think about that aspect of it. So much of it is automated anymore.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fcl6vcn,t1_fcl6f7e,1577741088.0,They don't even get to look out the window. They fly IFR (Instrument Flight) everything is a screen in front of them and it helps make sure they don't get disoriented when going through clouds and weather.  Pretty interesting but not much window looking for airline pilots.

Anxietyhelp,f9j3umu,t3_e5b767,1575355031.0,"I just bought a mouth guard set (6 total) on Amazon. I was able to mold it to my mouth after following the directions. They have been working really well for me.  I wear it at night and I can tell it is helping when I wake up. My neck isn't hurting as much and my cheeks aren't raw anymore.  The first few nights were not easy as I was getting used to it.  I have also been wearing it while at home doing my homework and papers (I am in grad school) since I find myself clenching and grinding when I am studying. I have been more aware of it since getting the mouth guard but my jaw and cheeks feel so much better.  It was a $8 purchase that I wish I had made years ago.  Check it out, and as weird as it sounds don't just use the mouth guard at night at first! 
Good luck!"
DIYweddings,f94a8iq,t3_e3owx7,1575081998.0,We did ours on Amazon Photo!  They have multiple options for designs or you can create your own. We did a black and white old west picture with the info on the back! It cost $100 for 150 Save the Dates and envelopes with the return address on them! I am really happy with how they turned out ( we did a small batch of 10-20 . . . Can't remember) to determine if they were good before ordering the bulk amount! Pretty sure we will be doing the wedding invites the same way! Good luck!
wedding,f871fff,t3_dzczfr,1574312784.0,Beautiful! That dress is stunning on you!
Weddingsunder10k,f25n22a,t3_dby3ai,1569978691.0,I think you look beautiful.  PMSing can really mess with your head as well as your body! You look stunning! The back is GORGEOUS and the belt/sash will make it even more beautiful.
Anxietyhelp,f1naezz,t3_d9s9v8,1569612661.0,Does it feel like your stomach is being twisted and it hurts? Mine is doing that today and I did have an anxiety attack this morning.  I have never had stomach issues like this (I usually vomit) and I am slightly worried.
wedding,f0fzkpa,t3_d4l0ii,1568591381.0,Wow. You are STUNNING!!!!!! It is going to be beautiful. ðŸ’•
AskReddit,f0fcbcd,t1_f0ewpwp,1568581168.0,Yep. That one is terrible and why there is now standard language that MUST be used. I am studying Aviation Safety! It's fun! But the more I learn the less I want to fly. I still love to fly though.
wedding,ezn1keq,t1_ezjdc1p,1567999695.0,"I saw this a few months ago at the wedding. Only one person knew how to use the printer and he was happy to do it, but he definitely missed out on the reception because if it. It was a great idea though!"
wedding,ezn16mu,t3_d1k10b,1567999544.0,I bought mine a year and a half in advance! Not too early if you found the dress you love! Plus it takes time for the dress to come in and time for the alterations!
cats,ey6xxwu,t3_cvuk5m,1566866579.0,Aww Nathan! ðŸ˜»
