But now I know that I failed just like the previous times I dieted. A very small part of me feels like why even bother if I will fuck it up anyway a few months later. But I want to. I just feel kind of helpless. Im too overwhelmed with everything.

Ah also my self-esteem depends on my looks. It was low anyways. But a few days ago I tried on my fave summer dress from last summer. Or more like I wanted to, but couldnt get it past my chest. Just made me hate myself a little bit more. Idk man, I just dont know how to love myself anymore.

I keep trying but I feel pathetic. Every day is a new chance, and actually writing this all down made me feel a little better. What if I fucked up the past 150 days. A new day to unfuck my life and eating habits. Maybe I will succeed again.

But Im really not motivated to do anything at all. I have average/good grades at my university and Im still told that why am I even going to university because I failed an exam. Lol. Literally noone appreciates me trying to do anything because Im not the best at it (yet). So that also gave me the ""why even try"" mindset.
