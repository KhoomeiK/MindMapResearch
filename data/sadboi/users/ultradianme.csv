BipolarReddit,f64i2w9,t3_dqgrd1,1572692572.0,"I've been keeping a blog about my experiences and I was just writing about still going between hyperactive/agitated and literally asleep in the middle of the day ([https://ucbd.me/a](https://ucbd.me/a)). I've been on Depakote for a year and a half and last week my level was measured at 89 (for reference the therapeutic levels are 50-100), so you'd think I'd be fine.

It's more than frustrating, but a frank conversation with my psychiatrist and we're making some changes to try to level it out more. When I do get euthymic, I then struggle to know if changes are the kind of changes everybody experiences or if they're the start of something.

Unfortunately, we just have to be ever vigilant."
