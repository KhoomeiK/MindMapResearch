I get that rich people would have more access, but don't they already? And wouldn't this incentivize people to give them up for someone else? And insurance could defray or cover the cost of the organ itself. Also you'd have more supply which means price goes down.

Point being: turn a black market into a regulated white market and you solve a problem for a lot of people, while also providing a benefit to the person giving the organ."

But what does this really mean? You’d have to get a judge to side with you in a case against the employer, and in this case, it seems unlikely that the person would even consider legal action, due to the prohibitive financial cost and time necessary for someone working a fast food job.

Additionally, and to my original point, in every one of the several restaurants where I have worked (both fast food and otherwise) I have had to sign an agreement that I could be “terminated for any reason, at any time, without warning”

Point being: even if the restaurant is actually firing you for liability concerns for a peanut allergy, the agreement they make you sign when you are hired enables them to fire you in a way that makes it incredibly difficult from a legal perspective to prove that you were fired because of an allergy. It’s easy to fire someone with a disability while remaining officially within the law. That doesn’t make it not a dick move, but it does make it possible.

As an aside, I think it would be best that you not assume that my response was based on ignorance simply because it appeared to you to be a “partial understanding.” Maybe next time make sure that your understanding is complete (at least your understanding of the other person’s argument) before patronizing people."
