1. If you‚Äôre not 100% sure on what to study up on, just try different subjects and you never know you may stumble upon something and that you might actually like.

2. Always always show up for class, there are some professors who won‚Äôt give you class notes and you‚Äôll have to get it from someone else. 

3.And always turn in your work on time and ask your professors as many questions as you can if you‚Äôre struggling with the topic. I know some college students who don‚Äôt do that and many have failed (I almost did) 

4. Organize your schedule, for me I like working at night. I‚Äôm most organized and more focused, it‚Äôs different for everyone. 

5. No last minute homework, it‚Äôs super stressful and many professors will not give you the chance to turn it in if you are late. Even with exams, you miss an exam that‚Äôs it for you so. 

6. Stay on your professors good side, trust me. I‚Äôve had professors who sometimes will give me an extension because they know I‚Äôm a hardworking student. 

7. Great thing about college is you have the choice to pick morning or afternoon classes but I stick to morning classes so I can have the rest of the day to do my work. 

8. Talk to the school counselors, about your where are you actually want to end up after college. Just make monthly or weekly meetings with these counselors. 

9. Your mental health is super important, college is very stressful. When you have days off where there‚Äôs no work and no class work, focus on yourself. 

10.Have fun, meet new people enjoy the parties when you can. For me when I started college I wanted to change myself a little, be a whole new person that know one knew."
