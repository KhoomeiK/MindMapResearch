Side note: does it really matter? I think grammar is far more important."
WTF,fl0qarp,t3_fltsw2,1584713325.0,This makes me want to burn my phone.
AmItheAsshole,fl0q3uu,t3_flr1bs,1584713194.0,"Definitely NTA!
It’s so awesome you took the time to take your sister to a show she would be interested in. You did what you needed to do to make sure she didn’t have a meltdown. And she enjoyed herself. Other dude is the AH and needs to realize that anyone loves monsters trucks and deserves to go to a show. She wasn’t aggressive. She wasn’t melting down. She was enjoy herself."

Putting this into perspective as a woman with a lot of hair: I don't wash my hair every day and so using a high quality shampoo and conditioner is worth it to the health of my hair and its not very expensive in the long run.  If I only buy shampoo and conditioner every other month, is $50 really that unreasonable?  My husband on the other hand washes his hair every day and it would be a waste to buy him expensive stuff.

I'm really glad OP has accepted the judgement and I hope he can smooth things over with his girl."

AmItheAsshole,fksn04f,t1_fkrzzi8,1584493767.0,"I’ve had diagnosed GAD/social anxiety with mild OCD/depression for about 2 years. I also do not tell many people at all about my anxiety. I really have to know someone and trust them before I let them know I struggle with it.  I don’t want people to baby me or think less of me or think I’m just faking it. Just about the only person who truly sees me and my struggle is my husband, god bless him. 

When I was not able to do parts of my job (make phone calls), I got help. I went to therapy and got on meds. It’s still not perfect, but I can do my job. I would never get a job that required me to make phone calls every day all the time, so I cannot understand taking that job and then telling my boss I can’t do it due to my mental disorder."
gifs,fkh3gob,t1_fkgga1z,1584187113.0,I buy this exact pack from Costco and it lasts me for at least 6 months. The biggest hassle is having space to store the all that toilet paper until it’s gets down to more manageable amounts. I can’t even imagine where people who bought insane amounts are keeping it. (Probably next to their 10 cases of bottled water) Though they probably have transformed their garage into a bunker.

TrueOffMyChest,fkfxrug,t3_fhx3ct,1584145067.0,I was extremely lucky that I had my costco run about a month ago. Bought one of their big packs and we are good for six months. I keep seeing people buy packs and packs of the stuff and I just don't understand. Also the people buying ridiculous amounts of bottled water. I don't get it.

gerbil,fkb9es4,t1_fkb3eqo,1584028730.0,My boys are very picky too. They like Timothy hay biscuits.... some days. Don’t like yogurt blueberries. They like dried strawberries and other dried fruits. They like corn Chex. But honestly.... it’s all about the pumpkin seeds. Pumpkin seeds are LIFE to them.
