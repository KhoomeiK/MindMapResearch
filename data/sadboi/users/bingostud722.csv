CPTSD,f8c7mj0,t1_f8bsdzm,1574454322.0,"I was going to say this same thing. Childhood trauma is happening during the developmental stages of your childhood, and can have extreme lasting effects, and can be very abstract. It starts impacting all of your life decisions as you grow up, which due to the underlying PTSD (likely undiagnosed and untreated at this point) driving those decisions can put you in bad places piling on even more trauma. It's just not as black and white and takes place over time, and grows. It's much easier to be able to point to a moment when you saw some horrible shit at war and *know* when it started and *know* you have PTSD.

Childhood trauma is a whole other beast, ambiguous in nature, where many don't even realize that is what is happening, blaming themselves for all these bad things they do/did that truly were driven by a broken decision making process due to trauma. Which for a child brought up in a traumatic situation, they may just view it as just normal life because that has been their life as long as they have had memories."

They are naive. Anyone who equates active combat with PTSD and can't seem to comprehend PTSD from another source is either purely an asshole and doing it on purpose, or is mentally unable to handle and address it, which if you ask me is a sign of a weak minded person in and of itself. My fiance deals with her CPTSD every god damn day and it is legitimately physically debilitating. Seizures, even complete catatonic states, to the point where she is unable to walk, talk, or even respond to stimuli for a period of time.

Here's the thing - I was completely uneducated in this area until I met my now-fiance. I have had no significant trauma in my life, had what would be considered the ideal childhood, parents still together, no major money issues, etc. The worst thing I've dealt with was a divorce in my late 20s which sent me in to a somewhat nasty depression, until I met her. Aside from the depression, I have by all accounts coasted through life. Yet, somehow, from the very beginning I was able to work with my fiance through it, catatonic states and all, going on 4 years now.

Even before I gained insight in to the ravages of PTSD, somehow I was able to just be a nice fucking person and not shit all over someone going through something difficult. With just a smidge of effort I was able to understand what she was going through while also recognizing I cannot truly *understand* it if you get what I mean. The person who said this to you is everything wrong in this world, unable to see through the surface layer of their direct experience and be able to comprehend things foreign to them. These people piss me off to no end, I wish I could talk to them directly even just to explain to them how to me, they themselves have what I consider a mental disability in the fact that they seem to be unable to comprehend anything outside of their direct sphere of influence and understanding. They have no ability to place themselves in another person's position or comprehend pain they themselves have not been subjected to. Naivete at it's finest.

The good news is that I am proof positive that there are people out there who do give a shit, who have not been through significant trauma, yet still can empathize with you without having experienced the same trauma, and not judge you for your symptoms and experiences.

&#x200B;

I hope you are able to find happiness, but know that you are not weak. My fiance is not weak. If anything, she is stronger than I could ever hope to be, as she pushes through demons I cannot even comprehend daily."

CrazyHand,f0ltvra,t3_d5axdz,1568729438.0,"Something to note that I didn't see mentioned elsewhere, but I have a lot of problems hitting jump (for me Y on GC controller) and getting my thumb down to the tilt stick to effectively do aerials. I solved that by mapping a second jump button to the L trigger, so I can jump/drift separately from using my aerial (so I can do a retreating bair for example). This improved my game *significantly*, so if you're going to have to learn some new muscle memory and think that might be for you, it's worth learning both at the same time."
CrazyHand,f0lrr3k,t3_d57vzl,1568727863.0,"For me it has been all about tech and practice. When I have to think too much about *my* options, I can't give enough thought to what my opponent's options are. Many things in smash are simply too fast (...at least for me) to react to in any meaningful way, which is why learning to read your opponent is so important. Problem is it's a lot of information to download quickly, so you need all the brainpower you can get. For me, once I started getting the tech down to a science, where I can bust out RARs/IRARs without thinking about it at all etc, suddenly I'm getting much better reads on my opponents. So it's likely that it isn't that your reaction time being too slow, it's that you are paying attention too much to what *you* need to do. When I'm doing that I just don't have the bandwidth to think about a match in the same way as I can when just observing."

It's a tough situation, banning guns is the only full proof option but it's not going to happen in this country. Background checks are not going to weed out idiots, just criminals, and not even all of them. To be honest I have no idea what a solution would be, honestly I don't think there is one."

If you actually love and care for your SO, you want to see them happy. The rest (sex etc) comes as a consequence of that, but if you're faking giving a shit that your SO is happy to meet your needs, humans are pretty damn good at reading the subtext.

Problem in this case is that it is a 2 way street - if either one of them is ""faking"" it, resentment builds, and it's really hard to resent someone and also genuinely want to see them happy.

CrazyHand,ezpym5k,t1_ezppt5n,1568051493.0,"Yeah it's especially useful for the IRARs IME. It definitely takes some getting used to, I still use the A button for a lot of aerials, but when I'm trying to drift one way and attack the other way it's a nightmare without it. Once you build the muscle memory you can fire off nicely spaced bairs like crazy and slowly work your way in. Note this is all on a GC controller, but should all apply to a pro controller as well"
CrazyHand,ezpp1ma,t1_ezp71su,1568045225.0,"Just something to note, do you use the normal jump button? I main inkling as well, and being able to RAR and iRAR consistently is probably the number one thing that allows me to approach zoners (or really anyone), without getting punished. It's safe on shield if you space it right, so spacing is also something to practice. Lastly, B reversing splatter shot is useful for feigning approaches and catching their attempt at a punish.

I use the L button for jump specifically for performing the RARs/IRARs with the C stick, as moving between the normal jump button and the C-stick is way harder and I can never get it consistently. Not only that, but NOT using the C-Stick makes it very hard to do a retreating aerial as you mentioned.

Took me about a week of practice before the L button felt comfortable, but I just labbed out RARs back and forth on the training stage a bunch and now I can get them about 90% of the time, as an inkling main I think it'd def be worth your time

news,ews67cz,t1_ewrf2m9,1565721011.0,"Honestly that seems to be the case at a lot of software companies as well. I can spout off about why something is an obviously horrible decision til I'm blue in the face, but if the project or product manager disagrees there's not a lot that can be done about it"
changemyview,ew89ce1,t1_ew861ax,1565205937.0,"Curious (and honest question), how would you change the way they report to minimize the damage to the psychology of the masses? Obviously they could adjust the rhetoric and how thirsty they are for those views and clicks, take steps to avoid more shooters by not naming suspects, etc, but at the same time the information *will* be reported. In the end you are still being informed that people are going on random killing sprees on a semi-regular basis in your own back yard.

So sure, I could die via car crash, lightning strike, etc any day of the week, and it's far more likely. I think for the average person there is a big difference between the fear of dying in an accident, and the fear of being targeted and killed by someone. Even if the probability is minuscule, I'd posit that the fear of being killed has far more psychological impact than the fear of dying in an accident. For proof of that just look at the panic around Islamic terrorism over the last 20+ years and how significantly it has impacted policy and invaded the American psyche. The chances of dying in a terrorist attack based on the numbers is absolutely miniscule, yet everyone in America has had their life impacted in *some* way by it, even if it's just flights are less convenient - it's the cumulative impact that matters IMO."
changemyview,ew84o08,t1_ew816pa,1565203226.0,"If you focus solely on body count then sure, it's not a significant problem in the grand scheme. That said I would posit the impact on the psychology of the masses is huge. The shootings combined with the media coverage IMO at least absolutely has a significant impact on the population at large.

That doesn't even consider the trauma induced both to victims, relatives of victims, and people who weren't shot but were being ""hunted"". Even if one doesn't even have an ounce of empathy for a victim's personal trauma, the damage done to *society* by introducing chunks of traumatized individuals goes far deeper than just ""people feel bad"". It isn't limited to the individual. It's difficult to get any kind of numbers/measurement, but being very close to at least one person suffering from PTSD, I absolutely believe those traumas (and non-shooting related traumas too) are having a massive impact on society through influencing behavior post-trauma, which can span *generations*. The more research I have done on PTSD and the cycle of it getting perpetuated from parents to children generation after generation blows my mind, and IMO has been made glaringly apparent with the advent of social media.

Tough part is, any time I try to make this argument, I can't exactly prove it. How do you even measure that? That said as someone who does not have PTSD but am engaged to someone who does (and have done significant work/study to be helpful during the therapy process), it has opened my eyes to both the massive impact it has on society at large.

I think if you could look at every variable, and watch the dominoes fall year after year, decision after decision, we do not just have a ""mental health"" crisis in this country. It is a low key virus, that perpetuates through social interactions, and the advent of social media has accelerated the process. Since humans in places like the US are tasked with fewer and fewer things they *have* to do to survive, they either end up wallowing in their misery or, for the lucky ones, find help/outlets for dealing with their problems.

&#x200B;

I could expound on all of those points much further, but in the end since I can't produce hard numbers it's not likely to change people's minds. That said, I personally think this is a major, core issue in the US right now, but even those spouting about a ""mental health crisis"" are often just using a phrase in a gun control debate. Problem is, it's not just with guns or shootings. Parental abuse, spousal abuse, accidents, shootings, even just having abysmal surroundings can all traumatize an individual, and very often they have no idea how to handle it. When you spent your whole life just trying to make sure you have enough food/shelter/water to survive the winter, people could focus on those things and the trauma wouldn't fester quite the same way.

&#x200B;

With the benefits of modern life, come the misery of realizing humanity is only just now kind of figuring out we don't know how to truly deal with our emotions when left to focus on them."
changemyview,ew74tt5,t1_ew6z7ix,1565186168.0,"That's the problem, IMO this is the most important part of this system and whenever I see this question answered, it's always a vague idea, when it is the part of the system that needs the most rigorous definition. I think the *idea* of it is attractive, but it seems to be so far a system that is susceptible to being exploited."
depression,ew2akrr,t3_cmcier,1565042053.0,"Just to add a ray of hope to this, I work at a company where upper management is not exactly enlightened in mental health, but I had a colleague take a mental health day and surprisingly there was no significant resistance. Note I would NEVER have had the balls to ask for a mental health day in the past here (been here a while and would never have expected it to go well), he said they asked a couple questions as far as what he meant but he just explained it and they granted it.

&#x200B;

Sad that it has to be surprising when that happens, but the fact that it went off without issues here of all places gives me a small amount of hope for the future, and gives me a little more confidence if/when I need to ask for one in the future."
CrazyHand,ew10via,t3_clrp9h,1565012242.0,"I definitely have been hitting plateaus - usually when I hit one I know it's time to learn/try to master something new. The pattern usually goes: improve a little bit over a long period of time (like a month), then plateau, then decide to try to put something new in my skillset (i.e. really practice tech like IRARs or something, or add some new stuff to my strategy), lose my ass a lot trying to do it in matches, then something clicks and suddenly I improve quite a bit in a short period of time. 

atm I am currently in the lose my ass a lot part of that cycle after trying it better incorporate jump on the L trigger in my arsenal, but my fingers very much do not want to cooperate..

That said I will also second trying out another character for a while, I always go back to Inkling pretty quickly but I find different characters require you to get better at different tech, so if you can master another character you can bring facets of that back to your main, which can be helpful as well."
