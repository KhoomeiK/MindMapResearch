Untap and play Noxious Grasp is also a decent answer and you trade up in mana tempo.  But I don’t love boarding in a card that sits around in your hand to answer just one threat.  Murderous Rider is a more general answer but you won’t be left with mana open to counter anything, which is not ideal.

spikes,fo3qdju,t1_fo0ts70,1587491235.0,"OK, so I’ve played around with a variant on this deck for a while and here are my thoughts:

1. I find that explosion is just not working as advertised.  Ikoria decks are really fast and I usually can’t win a race if I tap out to explosion them for a non-lethal amount on turn 5 or whatever.  Have you experienced this at all?  As a side note, I can’t totally tap out for Explosion because a lot of decks are holding up one mana for Mystic Dispute.

2.  Because of item 1 above, I end up playing the control role in most matchups because if I let something strong resolve (Fires, Teferi, Gyruda, whatever), they end up winning before me.  So my play pattern is often hold up mana for a counter or flame sweep, and if I don’t need to use it, play EOT Ambusher or draw spell or cycle Shark.

3.  In some matchups, Uro is difficult to tap out for, so I’ve been siding him out and went down to 1 in the mainboard.  He’s great late game though, if you get that far.  Similarly, I was playing a couple Wolfwillow Havens as Growth Spirals 5-6 but tapping out frequently isn’t worth except for T2 on the play.

The bottom line of all of this is that I’m leaning into more of a control/flash deck bolstered by Wilderness Reclamation.  If you have WR and six lands out, rather than tap out for an 8-point explosion, you can hard cast Shark, then untap with full defenses up and likely win through token generation.

Appreciate any thoughts."

I’ve been thinking about this card too and I would run it with Jegantha as companion.  This allows for a really strong reliable turn 5 of play Nest, delve 4, play Jegantha.  That way you’re not losing board position on the turn you drop Nest and you’re going to have a baller turn 6 unless somehow your opponent can deal with both Nest and Jegantha.

I also think the deck needs to be able to make use of the various graveyard shenanigans if you don’t draw Nest or it gets removed.  Uro is perfect for that and also helps you ramp into a turn 4 Jegantha and beyond.  Maybe Poulkranos too - needs playtesting to be sure.
