For me, I knew there was no way I was going to take a break. First time through, I answered all the ones I was confident with and skipped the ones I was unsure of. Then went back through and worked through the harder questions.  I had a ton of flash cards and would remove the flash card once I achieved mastery with it so only focused on what I didn‚Äôt know.  Good luck."

She would have some panic attacks when she was still processing her diagnosis, but as the end came near, she was calm and ready. Also time is something of this world. I think time will be completely different in whatever comes next for us, so you won‚Äôt need to worry about a sense of longing. I have t had a near death experience myself, but my husband did. He said he wasn‚Äôt aware he was dying, he was kind of confused and he relieved his life and it felt like this took a very long time. In our world, only a short time had passed.
