NPD,fq40jil,t1_fq3ny5q,1589072368.0,"Well. I would say, if you want to truly love someone and trust them, you have to start with yoursel. You have to like yourself, trust yourself. Yeah, with NPD its tricky. 

1. I made myself a moral compas. My own. I sat down and started thinking through, how I would like to behave, how I would like others to treat me, how ideally I would like all the people to treat one another. I also made some list in my had, what I dont want to do, what i find very bad in others and i did sometimes. 

2. I started to think about situations that happend and i wasn't satisfied with how i ended up behaving, or all the situations that ended up not best. I was trying to process my behaviour and think if there is any patter or moment i went full narc. 

I have very analitic mind so this step was kind of interesting and easier for me but i know it can be very hard. 

3. The hardest one.

Starting to spot this behaviour in your own actions, ideally when it starts to controll you, before you go narc. Then ehen you realise, break the pattern, in some stupid way. 

For example, you get in defence mode when you argue, you realise that, so instead of saying what you want to say, you just stop yourself and for example say ""I love you so much"" or idk, kiss her/him, i spit the water from the bottle all over my head when it was my first and it helped. I know xD 

4. When you will be getting better, you will see more and more, you will realise how stupid it all was, and one day maybe you will just feel it. Dont get scared its like the walls are breaking. I panicked, because all of my defence walls just broke and i was naked, i felt so much at once and I realised I never want to feel less, even if i will suffer because of that. Even if im vulnerable. 

I realised i wasnt strong and tough because of all those walls, i was scared and weak deep down.

Now im going other way. I want to feel and perceive all I can. Im trying to be tough and be able to survive every pain without losing smile on my face. Now I try to be like a viking. 

Ohh and sport helps, running helped me. Music and thoughts. 

Feel free to message me, i will be glad to help üôÇ"

If he was making up things, and seeing you cheating on him everywhere. Then there is even a special name for that kind of syndrom and its connected to alcohol. So  I would aks if he was drinking. On the other side if you cheated on him, and he would be a narc, he could be already self hating and it would make him lose his shit completely.

AskNPD,fp0rewe,t3_gaig4h,1588215257.0,"Well he is a douche thats for sure. You cant say someone is narcissist because he is an attention seeker.  its a lot more complicated and there is a lot more personality disorders to start with. 

Firstly I would ask myself where does this matter to you if he can be a narcissist or not? Why does it matters? 

The way he behaves towards you and others, should be the factor of liking him or not. If he is not narcissist then its ok for him to be like that? 

Secondly I would look if he can manipulate people. If he can appear somewhere and make people do what he wants. Ask him about it if you can remind some of the situations when he did that. There is a big chance he will brag about it. From my own experience, even if I hated the fact that I was manipulative, the thought about it was giving me satisfsction. Ironic I know.

1st. its very popular opinion anyway so....

2nd. What you say is just taking things too literally. Of course noone will be happy when he is starving daaa. There is literally nothing new or brilliant about this ""discovery""... 

This saying is about the fact that being happy is a state of mind. No matter how much money you have. After covering basic needs which is survival, everything else is addition you can live without.

Actually in my opinion, saying that you cant be poor and happy is an arrogance, and ignorance towards people who are. Go to Africa or poor regions of Asia, and look at people there, people who can be happy and poor. 

I have 500$ on my account right now. I am going different places, countries, work there and travel at the same time. I end up being basically mostly on 0 balance. Of course that would be a lot easier to do it with money and not work. On the other side, so many people cant do what I do. I am happy.

Of course people who speak and harass other with their idiotic opinions are negative, yet any for of preventing that will be censorship and will make someone decide what is allowed and what is not. This is the very center of the problem with a lot of stuff like for example guns. Some people are scared of everything and I their tiny  minds they can only see one solution, banning everything, those people even with good intentions are ending up at the same positions as those with harmful opinions. 

You stick to word Allowed so much like anyone is trying to or can prevent you from your views. That's proving my point. You try to prevent others people belives and you are scared someone will not allowe you to have yours? 

This is named discussing or confronting ideas. I speak my mind about what You say. Both having opinion and speaking your mind about somebody's opinion is opinion. I am neither angry, nor sad. It's about opinions. Although writing them in comments is not ideal.

Yeah they educated themselves especially when they were the first ones to do something like ""flying""...
Of course they did, based on their own experiments, laws of physics and everything that someone came up with because he was thinking outside the box. 

From my own experience. The only thing that can work is changing people's behaviour in your surrounding, speaking and discussing on a small scale, family scale let's say. Everything that gets less personal doesnt work. 

No it doesn't mean religion has to be bad, although it use to prevent people from thinking. Because they think they know. 

You are welcome. If you are a believer my words won't change that. If you get offended because I dont respect your god, well I dont. Religion caused too much suffer everywhere, for not believers there is literally nothing positive comming from religion. I base my life on what I know and think not what I belive.

2. Seriously, religion is a better source than ""what i think?"" You for real right now? Logic vs fairytales and you pick fairytales. 

Actually speaking your mind and saying ""what you thing"" is making humanity develop. Instead of closing our minds, people who ""doesnt know something is impossible"" actually manage to reach it sometimes.

1. There is a renewable solar energy that doesnt include solar panels and huge waste. Its based on reflecting concentrated light on the pipes with water which produces steam and everything else goes the same way as regular powerplants. 

2. There is a whole science about using so called ""waste energy"" which is what we are ""loosing"" in the production of electric energy.
* First which is popular for decades is called cogeneration and its about producing electric energy and heating the water for citiziens use in the same place, using the waste energy. Its not perfect but its something.
* we are actually getting a huge progress in gas turbines development and they are now able to go to  even above 60% of efficiency, then you can still reuse waste energy.
*burning natural gas, which is just metan, produces just CO2. 

3. Nuclear power plant cannot explode. It literally cannot. The nuclear fuel inside is precisely made not to be pure enough to go uncontrollable. What happend in Chernobyl is melting of the core. The explosion was about other instalations.

4. Chernobyl was a huge stuff. It left an enormous cloud of radioactive dust that went above half of Europe. What prevented a catastrophy was the fact that European coubtries managed to dose  iodine to their citiziens. Still effects can be visible on some generations for example in Poland where I came from, people in their 50 now, has higher chances of having cancer, although it's hard to precisely connect it to Chernobyl.

Starting some dating app can also help, but instead of looking for someone to fill the void, try to talk with people, to get to know them, who knows what can you get out of it.

Since friends seems to be ok without you, I would just mirror them, if they make you feel bad you are not losing anything. Sometimes you have to clean the room for new people you are going to meet. 

Although it hurts and seems like your life is meaningless it's actually a great opportunity to change for better. You can make changes, and start with the clean card among new people.

Maybe it's time to start reading what someone is actually writing. You did the same with the other guy. Ignore what he means and putting your words in his mouth. Well I got used for people treating me with no respects even if I try to show a point and have no bad intentions. Criticism can be a good thing. Good luck
NPD,f98gmiv,t1_f92sioy,1575178063.0,"I wonder if you miss the point of what im writing on purpose or you actually dont get it at all.  I also have the feeling that your way of perceiving the world is very kind of snowflake. Why do you change what I write into similar words yet, with different meaning and outcome. It's really easy to find something you are looking for in other people comments, if you decide to look at them with previously estimated opinion on the topic. 

I have the feeling like for some people you need to put a 100 pages explanation, that what I write is:

1. My opinion not claiming that it's like that in every possible example
2. I can be wrong
3. This is based on what I think and feel
4. Can be not objective
5. What I write is exactly what I mean, not something else that you will get after changing words and not something that you think is hidden because that way it can be everything. 

Now the answer. If you put any word like narcissist, NPD etc. In the web, what you will get will be mostly places where people who often has no idea what actually is it, brag about how they were hurt by narcissist. It doesn't even need to be actual narcissist, they don't have that knowledge. It's just so easy and comfortable to use that term for everyone that we think hurt us. I saw forums where women's were describing their multiple relationships and every one of the men was a narcissist. You won't see the place where you can get help, nah. All over the place you see posts of even educated people demonizing narcissists. I even met therapists who refused to help with NPD.

I don't care about any insults or anything. The thing I  was referring to at 1st comment is the fact. That those bad narcissists make a group and try to help one another to be better. People who often demonize us, who see monsters even when they don't even know us. I didnt see a single comment of a narcissist in this or other groups that would be mean to someone who described himself as a victim. I saw and experienced a lot of shit against narcissists. It's like, if you don't suit to kind of ""negative"" personality disorder you can be an asshole and doesn't need to change. If you do, and you try you are still the bad one. In my opinion that's ironic as hell.

I didnt sleep for like 35h so I probably made some mistakes and can sound harsh. It's not intended. Good day everyone."
NPD,f92oe50,t1_f92bo3s,1575038090.0,"Well we could meet here and write about how others are worse than we are. We could talk about improving our negative skills. Yet, we seek help, and talk about being better here. People who create groups about being victims,  often qnot only demonize narcissists, they don't look for any facts. They don't want to understand or help one another, simple just shouting. Of course not all of them, and it's about ""them"" behaving worse."
depression,f929lrw,t1_f91es1z,1575019412.0,"I'm afraid it's the same way like it's with growing up. You think you will be different than your parents and then you end up being similar. We know how stupid those words are but when it comes for us to prevent someone from doing something permanent, we just cant find a better option. We betray ourselves in the name of ""smaller evil"". 

I belive I managed to beat depression. Life seems valuable to me again but tbh I have no idea how to help someone else who is in the same shithole I was. I just don't know. I can do it in the real world, but with words, here? No idea. So I got why we do this... 

Showing others that depression is beatable, seems more like a show off or fake than actuall way of doing something. I have been thinking about it for long time and I'm still Jon Snow."

NPD,f8cxr3d,t3_e06ucw,1574472352.0,"First I felt powerful. I went to psycho-therapist because one day I just experienced emotions and feelings I never had before and I literally couldn't controll them this time. Yeah... controll, that what I was doing. When she got to know me and put the diagnosis, after some consulting, she seemd to become kind of distanced to me. Without special trying I manage to win argument with her, the way she literally told me, that she would have to agree with me and she cant do it as therapist. That day, I felt superior

Later when I didnt go to therapy anymore, I realized once again why I went there for the first time. I started to read about NPD, to talk with people here, and recalling stuff that therapist said. I started to see my negative behaviour, the moment it happens, not later like before. It was the moment when I got got by it. I was splited between being sad about it and feeling the need to be unique, being narcissist. 

After my therapy fail. I wanted to prove that I can become better, and I can do it by myself. My own therapy, my strong will. That I could beat it by myself, which now seems like something that narcissist would say.  I'm afraid I might have improved my narcissistic skills instead. I reached the level of controll over myself, that I seemd to be better, while actually I was just able to use my traits how I wanted, without showing myself to people from negative side.

Since that moment, a lot changed in my life. I think it's still in me, but instead of focusing on it, I went different way. I am trying to be the best version of myself possible. Especially when it comes to people. Sometimes I make myself do it, but I do. Sometimes I analyze my behaviour, kind of scared if I'm not going back to it, sometimes I try to catch some behaviour and eliminate  it from my life, like I just stop myself right before lying about something, no matter what is it, I try to stop myself. Mostly I just live and try to be happy, try to help people, and smile. I know how it can sound, so silly right? If I still have some traits and they don't hurt anybody, I can be a good human being and I can be happy. I had to realize, that what actually matters in this world are people. I don't feel it sometimes, but I can make myself recall my feelings or thoughts from other time and stay with them."

Religion is easy, because you can always be forgiven etc.  But, I try to respect peoples belives, my friends etc. so when someone says he is going to pray, for me its literally like he is not going to help at all, but instead of that, he will talk to his imaginary friend. 

Its like if you have an accident and the nearest person calls his uncle who is atm climbing Mount Everest, to come and help you.

NPD,eqbv5x2,t3_by1v1i,1559957200.0,"Well my childhood was a happy one and my parents are one of the kindest people i know. I am in good relations with them and they always try and tried to support me. The only punishment that my parents ever did to me was cutting my PC time or made me apologise someone for something etc. Nothing physicall. 

If you are interested I can try to explain how NPD probably got me. 

According to my former therapist, I had a huge problem with being misunderstood. I mean, I wouldnt say I'm a genius but i was a very clever kid.  Being the only child made it a bit funny because on one side my parents were focused on me, especially my mother was so sure about me being smart etc. But on the other hand they didn't listen to what I was saying. So my young brain was too mature to be satisfied with other kids hobbies and chat topics,  and grown up's treated me not serious. The more I was ignored by others in conversations, I mean during christmas with adults or others, the more I was becoming selfcentered. The more they were talking stupid stuff about something, Iknew better than them, and ignoring my opinion at the same time, the more hatefull I become. 

Later in life, I was really interested in II world War history, and I met the same sort of people. I wanted to be in history reconstruction group, but It felt like being in kindergarden. People making up some in group conflicts, politicall corectness  when it comes to history facts, etc.

I really value being objective, but I do it to the  point where people start to be angry. For example, a lot of time I was like an average guy when it comes to history. Germans were Bad, Russians were bad, poor Jews, etc. But the more I got into it, I was finding out about bad stuff that allies did. About all the politics behind all the other wars. That was the time when I got angry. I started sympathizing with III Reich history, Nazis history, not because i supported them nah. I just wanted to know 100% truth. Understand why some people did what the did. For me a simple explanation ""because they were nazis"" is not enough. So I was making up some conceptions, for example why holocaust was profitable for nazis. Its not like I supported it, not like i liked it. I just wanted to be objective and understand it from diffrent point of view. People dont get that. People called me nazi etc. So I become more and more angry. I felt their ignorance and made a foundation of my self made statue out of it. They couldnt understand it, their feelings were in the way. I cut mine off. I built walls to ignore the world. People meant nothing to me, because they were stupid, and pathetic, they couldnt understand my upper level thoughts.... 

Yeah.... im not like that anymore, I crushed those walls etc. Im still truth seeker, I still love to be objective as fuck, but now, I use it to understand why people doesnt want to get what I am thinking about. 

If someone actually red that, cheers mate. Sorry if I made grammar mistakes, not a native english speaker and my new phone doesnt make it easier, it's sometimes changing some words to bollocks."

I am actually trying to be a good human being and when I understand that I am manipulating someone or that I behave alongside my traits, Im upset about it.  But... yeah but emathy is something I fail to learn. Dont get me wrong, I learnt it the other way, a mechanical one. I made schemes about how diffrent behaviour affect others, I try to behave like I think I would like to treat someone in specific situation, and how its good to treat others. But... I cant feel it. Tbh, I dont even try to learn it now, because it frustrates me. Nowadays there is so many overeacting people that me, trying to be emotional feels so fake and im disgusted by myself.

INTP,eonui45,t3_bsgwkl,1558721876.0,"So INTP's in my opinion, tend not to be religious because we dont treat someone's made up stories as ""answers"" like you said you do. 

All old religions and in my opinions the ones still existing, were made to give simple answers for scared people. Now we can explain why people belived that Thor was throwing lighting. We know drugs that made native americans saw ghosts etc. 

I am not scared and I am not uncomfortable with life without all the answers. Searching for them is something I am living for. Religion is too simple to boring and tooo arogant. I cant be 100% sure while religion is. 

To be honest, I am jelous of beliving in god. I think its  nice to have someone you can talk to when its bad. When I fail, its only my mistake, there is noone to comfort me. When someone important die, I wont see him again, I guess, I would really like to belive that I will."
INTP,eokl19i,t3_bs95gg,1558657114.0,"I felt like you changed the retorics during the text. Since at the begining it was more of explanation  of self nihilism, later came to some true (in my opinion) conculsions. Anyway, what you said at the begininf about environment etc. Also religion. I dont really like the view that something is beyond us, because in my opinion its only an excuse for us not to do something, not to be better. For example you told about environment, yeah its not really that hard to just understand some fact and get use to care about it, we just cant let people not to care because its ""our"" future. For me what you said seems like you are trying to find an excuse to not care, to be lazy and doesnt give a damn. 

Religion. Yeah i try to respect religion but i just cant. Of course belive what you want but sorry it shouldn't be an excuse like it often is. In my opinion religion is for weak people who can't stand the feeling of being alone, of the world without any upper sense. 

I think religion is an excuse too ""God's will"" etc.
If you compare people with self moral code and those who got it from the religion, what do you think which one is tougher? Who will disobey his rules first? I live in a country with high catolics ratio but most of them are hypocrites, not obeying their own laws. They fight for ""life of unborn babies"" in the same time stealing and betraying each.

I dont like low difficulty level in games neither in life. Accepting that we are ""just people"" is not an option in my eyes. Get better, control yourself or die trying.  

You can escape the society and still not be an ignorant."

Sooo, since narcissism is a spectrum, and most narcissists doesnt suspect to be one, its obvious there will be plenty of people who just seek a group, to feel united, place to belong. Groups like that are cosy. 

On the other hand, you become narcissist, being young only matters in diagnosis, its not like they wont become narcs. In my opinion, if those young people can see wrong behaviour patterns now, hear about that its not good to be narc etc. Maybe just maybe some od them will change and not become a narcs. Maybe things we talk about can help someone who has totally diffrent disorder or mwntal ilness, there is plenty of those who are simmiliar at some point. Why would we be angry about it?"
