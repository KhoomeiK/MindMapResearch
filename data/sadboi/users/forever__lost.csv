depression,fq6npsr,t3_ggm8fw,1589135054.0,"I do feel the same way... a lot. But the thing is that depression can never be compared or anything like that. Every true feel of depression is valid. It is always because of something that truly hurted our heart, some trauma that we might not remember or our perception of the world as individuals. And everything we feel is valid, and please please please never feel guilty about it. Never stop taking care of yourself and loving yourself. Because we have to be always our own priority, we have to take care of ourselves first. Otherwise how can we give our best to the world and to the people we love? Less guilt and more self love, okay? Sending a big hug to you ♡"
