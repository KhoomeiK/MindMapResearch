NYYankees,fqooway,t1_fqonrnh,1589520636.0,"Yeah we've dealt with unlucky injuries, we sent how many players to the DL last year and for how many trips? It was a ML record. 

My biggest worry is having to retool the rotation after this season, when Tanaka, Paxton and possibly Happ are all walking, and having to pick from Sanchez, Judge and Torres who you ink a long term deal with"

depression,epifwzf,t1_epgp7tg,1559238643.0,Being depressed is more than the emotion of being sad...you're not interested anymore in stuff that you like. You don't feel down but instead you feel numb. You might not want to die but you just don't want to be awake for right now because being awake means you still feel pain. It's not always a feeling of pain or despair or unfulfillment but rather the lack thereof of the opposite.
