vegan,fr4fj4g,t1_fr4e3b4,1589886609.0,"Sure, I agree in the sense that the Vegan Society's definition of veganism is vague, but I actually think the vagueness is a positive attribute. Life is pain, to quote Princess Bride. Just because I don't eat animals doesn't mean I don't cause harm by existing. I do, we all do. Life feeds on life. In fact I remember an infographic I saw as a teenager spelling out all the ways animals products are insidiously used in everyday products. It made me think veganism was a futile effort. But the more nuanced idea of reducing unnecessary harm actually frees us to do what we can while not being hindered by what we can't. That's why even among vegans, you'll find disagreements about used leather vs plastic, oyster consumption, palm oil, medicine, etc. But, I don't think you'll find a vegan who has decided that their line of reducing harm as much as possible falls short of consuming sentient animals when there are other options available. It is just such a clear, easy way to reduce harm.

I think you are engaging respectfully, I'm not offended at all. I suggest though that you try posting in /r/debateavegan sometime, as this sub is less receptive of arguments with omnivores (understandably, since for most of us it's the only place we have to interact with like-minded folks)."

But I think its important to consider that while dogs and sheep are (of course) different, there is no indication that the sentience of sheep is any less rich than dogs'. Just because dogs have been bred to connect emotionally with humans doesn't mean they suffer more when you kill them, nor does it make it more objectively tragic. That would be like saying it's worse to kill someone from my city than someone from across the world, because I share more in common with the former.

As a side note: Before I went vegan, I tried to eat animal products as ethically as I could, but I quickly found it to be almost impossible. Like in the scenario we're talking about: if you live in the city, how exactly do you find backyard eggs from hens who were sexed before hatching? What do you do at a restaurant or grocery store when you can't find out where the eggs came from? Many companies make unchecked claims about ""happy hens"" for marketing purposes; without seeing the farm yourself, how do you know any claims about the chickens' treatment are true?

Since no one can truly live a cruelty-free life, it's more about harm reduction.

It's not the same thing as a plant-based diet. Someone who medically cannot follow a plant-based diet can still be vegan, if they only eat what is necessary for their health. You can also still buy non-food products marked cruelty-free (which means they haven't been tested on animals and don't contain animal parts), adopt pets instead of buying from breeders, avoid irresponsible zoos and aquariums, etc."

My personal opinion is that they do, but it's probably not at all like the experience we conjure up when we imagine pain. Possibly more dull since they don't have a centralized brain, or possibly more intense because their conscious experience is limited to one overriding event/motivation at a time.

This is near where the glaciers stopped in the last ice age, so there are hills and valleys everywhere. I've heard that it's the hilliest city in the country, after San Francisco. Check out the old Disney movie Airborne to get an idea of the landscape. IMO the hills, along with the architecture (lots of Italianate and Art Deco buildings), give it a high amount of charm.

Cincinnati was a booming city in the early 20th century. It was on track to become what Chicago is today. That didn't happen, and there is a hint of Rust Belt decay and fallen grandeur here that you may not like (I do though). We also suffered a lot from highways that razed and severed huge urban neighborhoods. If you are going to live west of I-75, do your research; there are great areas but that part of the city will never recover fully from being cut off. We have been experiencing a bit of a renaissance the past 15 years, though, and revitalization is spreading (and along with that, gentrification).

The closest comparison I can think of is Pittsburgh, if you've ever been there. It's quite similar, although, as much as it pains me to say, I think Pittsburgh has us beat on charm. Mostly because of the fucking highways."

vegan,fmqu7ki,t1_fmqo79b,1586307156.0,"It's definitely not a high priority for me, and this YouTube guy is objectively hilariously cringey, but it's also interesting to take stock of idioms and the effect they can have. I worked for an animal rights organization for a while, where an emphasis was placed on framing language in a non-speciesist way. Felt silly at first, but once you get used to it, you do start to see how everyday phrasing helps perpetuate the idea that animals aren't important. For example, using ""it"" instead of ""he or she"" when talking about an animal has a very subtle, but pervasive, objectifying effect."

Nobody touches the animals, who live on twice as much land as Joe's zoo, and who were rescued from shitstain owners like Joe who breed and sell them with no regard for their longterm or short term welfare. BCR is *not* a zoo, and it's completely disingenuous to compare Carole to Joe."

You should do an AMA!!! People would eat it up and it would be a great opportunity to get your side of the story out there.

Coronavirus,fmc5zob,t1_fmc4pwj,1585939543.0,We're not at that level of triage where I am. Not yet. Our hospitals aren't full. I think it was more about keeping infected patients isolated.
Coronavirus,fmc2cqh,t1_fmbzvdy,1585937602.0,"Her doctor prescribed nebulized steroids over the phone. That helped with the breathing symptoms (she has an inhaler but it proved useless). Otherwise she didn't take medicine, just rested. It took about a week until she felt good enough to move around more. She's still taking it easy, but she lives on a small farm and is back to tending to her outdoor plants. She's a very robust person, used to toughing it out when she gets sick, so this was a pretty serious ordeal compared to an annual flu or cold.

My best wishes to your family."
Coronavirus,fmboax9,t1_fmbhphv,1585930199.0,"Yep, that's what they told my 70-year-old asthmatic mother. Never mind that she couldn't get out a full sentence without breaking out in a wheezing cough, or lie down without losing the ability to breathe entirely. Over the phone, her breathing was louder than her voice. It was terrifying. She did pull through, though. But she won't be counted among the statistics because she wasn't hospitalized/tested.

Edit: I'm not trying to say her doctor was negligent. She did as she was instructed and got better, and avoided infecting others by not going to the hospital. Other people needed help more than her, and these are extraordinary times. It was just really scary and worrisome."

One nut in particular is on top of a very thick spring. I tightened that about 5 or 6 rotations and the noise has stopped! I assume that spring needs to have some give so I won't tighten it any more. Hopefully the amount I tightened it won't do any damage.

It actually does pull you in right away because the acting is so good, it's just very confusing and difficult, but by the end the effect is powerful."
