Stutter,fp86ah0,t3_gbqdwf,1588384617.0,"Done! Love this survey. I’m curious about your findings. 

It was interesting questioning these things for myself, and finding out just how little stuttering has actually affected my career path. Luckily, I’ve had a lot of help from encouraging, nice people along the way. 

Right now I’m a Teacher’s Assistant and I have to teach a small class of university students. At first I was absolutely petrified to take the job when I was offered it. But my professor was incredibly encouraging. Now it’s my favorite thing in the world. 

Throughout my time being a TA I’ve learned a lot about myself. So many students have been supportive, and I’ve had the opportunity to inspire several of my students who also had speech impediments. 

Long story short: don’t let your stutter hold you back. Easier said than done, I know. And some of us can’t control our external situations, I’m aware of that. But, to the extent that you can keep pushing yourself to achieve more, keep going!! One day, I hope to be a college professor and teach full-time despite my disposition. Is it going to be incredibly hard and taxing on my self esteem? Hell ya! But I’ll be damned if I’ll let that stop me. I hope you all can find the same inspiration within yourselves and others too❤️"
