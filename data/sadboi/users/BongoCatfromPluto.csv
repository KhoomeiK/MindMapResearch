I hate my field of studies with a passion; I have been forced to study it, and it only caused me more depression, and literally gave me the desire to kill myself. I don't know where I am going in life, when my colleagues and friends have built theirs, and I feel that I wasted some precious years of my life.   
This was to me better than going back to my hometown, the story is complicated so I hope that no one suggests that I should've done this or that. 

  
I understand what you feel."

intj,fndecl2,t3_g0vqk5,1586867881.0,"I can very much relate, but I don't regret saying the truth based on facts. What buffles me is how people cannot see it while it is out in the open.

If we're talking facts, I'm going to put my feelings aside, and be objective, and I think that's what others should do too. I come of as a hard person because I say out loud what people keep to themselves, because for some reason truth is not appropriate, but stupidity, injustice, and getting along with wrong social impressions are.

As for your feelings, that will always be a battle, but you will come to reason with yourself."

intj,fl4yycl,t3_fm0rb9,1584824716.0,"Hello,

So before I answer your comments (and thank you for replying, by the way) I have to say that I am not necessarily looking to make friends (like so many of you seem to think), and this isn't the point of the post, not at all, I just wanted to know if we as INTJs had the same pattern of belief or the same operating system when it comes to this, since we tend to be more or less honest people, and honesty doesn't seem to work in this day and age (has it ever?). I also wanted to see how older INTJs delt with this, and how it turned out for them.

As for the evident advice given by some people, you should know that we don't all have the same privileges or live in open-minded  environments/countries that allow us to apply the suggested ideas that we already thought about. 

By intellectual compatibility I didn't mean that I was looking for snobs, or people that have the exact same ideas as me, just individuals that can reason logically. For example where I live, it is still believed that women are inferior to men, and that is justified, even by most women, and it is hard to talk to these people reasonably, or to be who I am, on a daily basis.

Thanks for reading me."
mentalhealth,fl2gxzt,t3_flzu62,1584750780.0,"He shouldn't have stopped it suddenly, his brain was probably getting accustomed to the molecule, if he has been taking it for a few weeks, but if he has been taking it for a long time, it kind of got used to it, and is dependant on it to function correctly. In both cases, his brain really needed it, because it provided it with the Serotonin supply it required to function efficiently. 

Randomly stopping taking antidepressants/anxiolytics is a big no-no, when your medical care professional decides that you have to go off of it, they do it by giving you lesser dosages, until you eventually stop taking it.

He should consult his doctor again, and refrain from making medical decisions by himself.

Good luck, OP, I hope he'll listen to you."

confessions,fiaiidt,t3_f788c1,1582301741.0,"Hey,
Out of complete selfishness, I am just going to go ahead and say it:
Please, let people around you know. You don't know about the big guilt that comes after losing someone that you valued more than the world or than yourself, and feeling completely weak for not even noticing that they were deteriorating because they decided to play it strong and cool, and you believed them.
Your family and friends care about you, and you deciding to go this way will scar/traumatize them for a life time, for we carry the ones we love till our extinction. 

Time and presence are valued, don't do that to yourself, or to your entourage.

Best wishes. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I have always thought so, but it happens that I think about the what ifs.

Is there a reason behind these ideas of yours?
