Anxiety,fbhhzue,t3_edcvhr,1576874111.0,"No doubt that ""just breathing"" isn't the only thing standing between you and your anxiety, but coming from someone who used to have anxiety attacks every time I was in a plane (between takeoff, turbulence, and landing, I was basically always on the verge of an attack), breathing really has helped me. Like other people have commented, the act of having something else to focus on can oftentimes distract my mind \*just enough\* so that I'm able to override the part of my brain that's like ""WHAT WAS THAT NOISE??  AM I ABOUT TO DIE? IS THIS PLANE FALLING OUT OF THE SKY???""

For me, my anxiety is very much manifest in short and shallow breathing. So taking deep, purposeful, steady breaths can really have a positive effect on my brain, because it's like ""I'm breathing fine, so I must not be anxious"". 

At the end of the day, we're all different and what works for me might not work for you. I think it's been pretty well-documented that breathing and meditative exercises can help people, but if you've given them a shot and they haven't helped you, that's okay, too. But also know that when people \*do\* suggest those things, it's coming from a good place. 

PSA: For my fellow Apple watch users, I'm a huge fan of the built-in ""Breathe"" app. It's what I use any time I need some help in the ""slow-breathing"" department (see: above about planes)."

I think that we should all be so brave as to confront the ugliness that still exists in our country--I, for one, don't want shit-stains like [Timothy McVeigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_movement) becoming associated with this flag, but they will be unless we give a shit enough to stop it."

Nobody is trying to take your colonial flag--but we should all appreciate the fact that there are shitty people in this country who would truly prefer a world whose society looked more like 1819 than 2019.

MURICA,eq7r0hn,t1_eq6rbtq,1559851673.0,"Oh wow, so they should simply be happy that they weren't massacred? What logic even is that? Would you also tell a German Jew that they should be grateful that they weren't killed in the Holocaust? Or a Japanese American that ""they're lucky they were only thrown in an internment camp--it could've been worse""?

Furthermore, what war are you even referring to? What war did the Cherokee lose where it was their punishment to get forcibly removed from their land? Objectively, white colonists came here and decided that they wanted this land--no matter if people had already lived on it. And they used their material advantage (or, in the case of some colonists, smallpox-infested blankets) to kick them out. 

Am I being Punk'd right now?"

and to try to say that ""it could've been worse"" is a comical justification for poor behavior. we literally uprooted people from their land and called it our own. in order to move forward as a country and to be better, we have to acknowledge our past mistakes."
