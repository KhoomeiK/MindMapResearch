witchcraft,fr5hm6a,t1_fr5eisn,1589908702.0,thank you for the suggestion! I really appreciate it. I usually try to avoid drugs as I’ve had anxiety induced hospital visits from recreational drug use. but if it’s under the care of a trained professional maybe it’s worth looking into
witchcraft,fr5e3lp,t1_fr3tdnm,1589907053.0,hasn’t worked for me but I’m glad it’s helped you! 😕
witchcraft,fr5e04u,t1_fr44eyl,1589907006.0,thank you for being honest! this is definitely the feeling I’ve had about the correlation for quite some time.
BlackPillFeminism,fr3fgd4,t3_gmd32f,1589856267.0,couldn’t agree more. Valerie truly was right!
PlasticSurgery,fr35jz0,t3_glye5c,1589850387.0,It didn’t even look bad before.
13ReasonsWhy,fr356ag,t3_gm4tl2,1589850167.0,still don’t get why this sub has such a hate boner for her

nametheproblem,fquf3ks,t3_gkm9m5,1589657795.0,men are so likely to get away with the most heinously disgusting shit and i’m tired
ShaneDawson,fqu28x7,t3_gkut1c,1589650615.0,He’s said this in multiple videos and podcasts. Whether he’s not “educated enough” it still reeks of privilege. Let’s not forget that he takes every opportunity to complain about how PC our culture is these days and complain about being called out for problematic behavior.
halsey,fqu1yti,t3_gkvlss,1589650458.0,So cute!

Cruikshank,fqoh81w,t1_fqogg2m,1589515177.0,not sure if this is a joke but Paris is a rich socialite turned actress/DJ and Perez ran a popular celebrity gossip website. both were way more popular in the mid-late 2000s.

antinatalism,fqo3fe8,t1_fqnh108,1589506774.0,they’ll be able to tell eventually. it’s more obvious than people think. emotional availability is an integral part of being a good parent.
Trufemcels,fqgnupb,t1_fqgnrut,1589351512.0,quite expensive i’m afraid! or so i’ve heard at least. 😕
Trufemcels,fqgmyob,t1_fqglt40,1589350747.0,C and D cups are fuller and heavier which means gravity does its thing. And there are treatments and surgeries you can have done to grow more hair.
Vindicta,fq4wlhy,t3_ggufbe,1589085951.0,Linda Cardellini for sure.
ShaneDawson,fq3cx93,t1_fq1l02z,1589065203.0,"Agreed, idk why anyone is surprised that Shane continues to enable problematic people. They act as if he doesn’t have his own history of saying and doing extremely fucked up shit and then getting mad when he’s called out for it. He’s exactly like them. The only difference between Shane/Jeffree & Trisha is that they’ve learned to stop sharing controversial views and doing controversial things and she hasn’t."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fp4pyhe,t3_gaxjbb,1588304542.0,"Mascara and lipstick are makeup. It would be accurate to say that you don’t wear face makeup or a base but it’s not accurate to say you don’t wear makeup. You don’t even need either of those things anyway, imagine how much money you’d save by giving them up."

cream lace bodysuit (also from abercrombie) with light wash high waisted jeans (zara.) gotta find a cute brown sandal to go with!

i spent last year leaning into athleisure and the whole 90s androgynous grungy style so i’m excited to lean more into a feminine look this year. gotta get some dresses!

When I realized that I was nothing more than a vessel for him to live out all his porny fantasies on and a distraction from the fact that he currently has no idea what to do with his life."

Trufemcels,fm9n6ep,t1_fm93t4w,1585872192.0,being catcalled is not a compliment. seek better forms of validation.
Trufemcels,fm6wc74,t3_ft9rf2,1585805165.0,honestly this post (and so many others on here) are so annoying lmao. please don’t think i’m defending male incels but some femcels are just as toxic. if there’s one thing i hate its someone who complains about their situation but does nothing to change it. r/vindicta is there for a reason. i understand that some people are just beyond the point of help and not everyone can be a becky or a stacy but damn. like yes i know lookism is a thing but y’all are so fucking toxic on here. i’ll bet half of you just have body dysmorphia and shitty personalities anymore.
