If you see the sky and think “the sky is so broad and making me thrilled” then you are a boy. If you think “wow those clouds are cute as cotton candy” then congrat now you are a girl.

Like dude I get it’s convenient to list the gender options like this but it totally doesn’t make any sense. A boy has all the rights to think the clouds are like cotton candy. And imagine a little girl unintentionally chose the “wrong choice” and being told that her opinion on the freaking sky is not “girl-like” and being forced to go back to choose the other thing.

Edit: my memory was based on the old 3ds version. I’m not sure if they changed it in the new switch version, but if so that would be great.

Edit2: sorry for bad English. not marshmallow, it’s cotton candy. They were the same word in my language and I got a bit confused."

Either he’s with some bad kids, he has problem with his own insecurity or even with you and your wife, or worse, he might hided something even more terrible behind. Clearly it’s hard for you to force the truth out from him and if the method was not correct he might grow resentment. So I really believe some therapy session could open his heart and help to stop me from going too far. 

You definitely should check if there’s any thing going wrong in your way of educating him, or where the hell did he get that much money to buy a gun from black market. But simply grounding him and to pretend the problem ends here is definitely not the right approach.

Every single living person in the mainland suffer from such fear, but the saddest part is that, they got used to such kind of fear, and even justify it. This is what censorship really do to people. Such fear make you self-censoring your thoughts and speech to make sure you are not thinking anything against the government in the first place. 

All people who have a little capability to immigrant have done that many years ago. My family as well. I love my country... no, I loved my country.
