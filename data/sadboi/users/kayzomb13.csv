bipolar,fhz6rpc,t1_fhxffq9,1581992162.0,"I‚Äôm on latuda, restoril, and pristiq! Most of my music is upbeat but sometimes it feels like I‚Äôm so lost in my mind I can‚Äôt even hear it. I tune it out"
BipolarDisorderReddit,ffgaiu2,t1_ffa2hit,1579901988.0,"I‚Äôve been using for 2 years. It normally boosts my mood up but when I‚Äôm in my depressive states sometimes the suicidal thoughts get worse. I love using while I‚Äôm manic, although my bank account doesn‚Äôt thank me for it"
BipolarDisorderReddit,ff9wwpw,t3_esgiix,1579723281.0,I also suffer from this and use marijuana nightly.

bipolar,fbuhqfh,t1_fbu2xlo,1577114605.0,I have often thought about raising awareness for mental health and ending the stigma! This is a great start for a purpose. Volunteering sounds like it could be up my alley if I could get over my social anxiety.
bipolar,fbuhg1x,t1_fbu8u23,1577114467.0,"I relate so much to the beginning of your story. I have been suicidal for as long as I can remember and attempted to take my life twice two years ago. Then I got hospitalized and got out on meds that have been helpful stabilizing me, but sometimes I still feel like I‚Äôm not meant to be here.  I‚Äôve been going to therapy and I think I should bring the feeling up to my therapist but I like your outlook on life. I will try to follow your lead and decided to live life my way to enjoy it a little more. Thank you for sharing"

bipolar,f6pu6j6,t1_f6pq7bh,1573064348.0,Yep! Dip it in white paint after getting it wet and then brush your finger on the bristles. It spreads out pretty evenly
bipolar,f6pq3nn,t1_f6ppqyo,1573061843.0,Yes! A sponge with some water to dilute the paint and then a toothbrush for the stars!

bipolar,f6o2slc,t1_f6o2k93,1573006322.0,Yes! I struggle with letting my paintings go. It makes me sad. But I also have trouble putting a price on them. I‚Äôm not sure how to sell anything or how much they‚Äôre worth. These are all things that I worry about haha.
bipolar,f6o0cux,t3_ds6gk5,1573004590.0,Thank you all for your compliments! It truly means so much to me!
bipolar,f6nzvk5,t1_f6nvyjz,1573004247.0,This is exactly what I‚Äôm trying to avoid actually! I feel like I could totally start a business right now but I know that it‚Äôs just my mania giving me the hype. Sadly I‚Äôm sure it will end and I‚Äôll go back to being depressed and not have any motivation to paint. The only reason I haven‚Äôt started selling my paintings.
bipolar,f3e29vr,t3_dgpoba,1570854761.0,Don‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm suffering from bipolar and I have felt what you are feeling. Just push through it! Sending good vibes

BipolarDisorderReddit,f3dz6x4,t1_extwsmi,1570851558.0,Same! I invested in a seasonal affective disorder lamp for the office when I‚Äôm at work. I‚Äôm hoping it has some effect. Figured it was worth a shot since I‚Äôm already on 3 medications
BipolarDisorderReddit,f3dygpt,t3_deaoz0,1570850882.0,Also living with bipolar disorder! Music is definitely my escape. I feel like it changes with my moods (depends on if I‚Äôm manic or depressive).
