YouShouldKnow,fr15ynr,t3_gm055y,1589813886.0,"The stars that open and shut

Fall on my shallow breast

Like stars on a pool.

-

The soft wind, blowing cool

Laps little crest after crest

Of ripples across my breast.

-

And dark grass under my feet

Seems to dabble in me

Like grass in a brook.

-

Oh, and it is sweet

To be all these things, not to be

Any more myself.

-

For look,

I am weary of myself!
