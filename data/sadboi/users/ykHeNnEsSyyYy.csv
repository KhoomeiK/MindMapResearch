LearnCSGO,fgorm1h,t1_fgoqhxx,1580983196.0,"I dont agree that people who switch because pros do it are stupid, its a pretty logical thing to do, its not stupid at all to copy the best players in the game thats just how people are. Even stwie2k plays 4:3 bb because he saw pros do it lol. It might not be the best thing to do but its not stupid at all. And it is also not placebo. You said urself that player,models are 33% wider. That is a prettty big amount. Playermodels are just bigger and easier to hit/spot thats just a fact. They do move faster thats true, that is the downside. But most of the time your engagements wil not be with sprinting targets so yeah chose for urself if u think the pros are better then the cons. Also there are good plahers with 16:9 and im not saying that 4:3 is better per se, and i played on 16 9 for a long time too. Im just saying he should try both and see what feels better, and most people switch anyway bc of most pros and most players in general playing 4:3"

If this was a skit posted on youtube or something it would have been bad yes, but its a livestream, and people said lulw kekw and shit because they just found it funny when theh saw it happening. Also you realize that most watchers are early teens right ? Why would it be weird for kids to laugh at these things ? Amnd why are you reafing into childrens behaviour so deeply ?"
LearnCSGO,fgooxxg,t1_fgoohqt,1580979335.0,"If he is smart he switches to whet feels better to him, and it does change mjch visibilitywise, if it didnt i might not even have switched but it also just felt better on 4:3 streched for me, so again he should try both and see what he likes"
LearnCSGO,fgoo35t,t1_fgol249,1580978116.0,"Yeah but i meant hes gonna switch because he sees all the good players use it lol, like most people do. None is better then the other tbh but i do prefer 4:3 while i have more hours on 16:9 , mostly bc i had issues clicking heads on long distances bc they are so small on 16:9 , sometimes even hard to spot quickly enough when only their head is visible on long distances for exaple pit on d2 when u are on site, but i think i might need glasses anyway idk lmao"
LearnCSGO,fgoilpo,t1_fgi8830,1580971307.0,"Nah 4:3 1440x1080 streched imo. Its still pretty sharp and all that, and its also 4:3 wich he is most likely going to switch to at some point, when he sees all the best players and stuff use it lol. I played 16:9 too but switched to 4:3. Maybe he can even just try both and see what feels better to him"

vegan,ez6dsef,t1_ez5tefm,1567711379.0,"Ur stupid indeed, and my native language isnt english so idrc about your grammar. 

And ur first point about not going tona place to go for me for u bla bla idk what you were saying, my point was if i tell you to stop doing something that is normal to do , only because i dont want it/agtee with it would you do it? No so dont expect it from others 

It doesnt make sense because they are eating in their own backyard were they pay for and were they decide what they do, you wouldnt want religious people living next to you punishing you for sins in wich they believr in now would you? So what you believe is right is for you and not for u to decide wether other people believe in it or want to live that way 

Again you can ask nicely if someone makes too much noise or something, not for just living their life. If you really want non meat eaters as ur neighbours you should find a vegan gated community and go live there, not minding other peoples buisness.

Meat eaters dont experience joy over suffering of other beings, much like other predators on the planet, they enjoy the meat. Not the suffering. I also dont eat highly prosecxed meat anymore because those animals live cruel lives and i agree most people dont even think abojt that, doesnt mean they enjoy the suffering tho.

You say vegans get frowned upon and not taken serious but when you speak of non vegans u call them omniscum/cheesebreathers. I dont know if you really dont see the hypocrisy but whatever.

Judges dont care because it is NOT against the law you idiot, do you know what judges do ? Because u sound really stupid. They are here to judge by the law and as long as meat is legal you can not just sue people for eating it

And no i dont care about my punctuation as im already typing on a big ass ipad wich drives me mad already and also you can stick your grammar up ur ass"
