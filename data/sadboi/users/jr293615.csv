The amount of courage that that took is unfathomable to me and can’t imagine how much stress and trauma you went trough after the fact with his friends going against your word. I am so happy that your high school project buddy stopped by that night and saved you. I am happy that you are still alive and were able to find comfort in something."

When I asked about her, he told me she was “just a friend” and I had “nothing to worry about”.

The whole thing did make me realize how toxic our relationship was and how terrible of a person he was outside of what happened between him and I. I hope he eventually finds happiness, but I’m so much happier without him."

A doctor will confirm if you’re in the green with follow-up tests after the surgery is completed. The fail rate for vasectomies after the follow-up testing is cleared is less than 1%."
