Pattaya,folqcw5,t1_fokz7uq,1587868006.0,"To be honest, the PH are only good if you likes beaches and girls. Compared to Thailand, there are no temples, the food is not good and there's nothing much to do. But walk in a mall and you'll find a girlfriend in less than one hour. Girls there are all crazy for foreigners. Another good thing compared to Thailand is that people are extremely polite and they all speak English. Most people speak almost fluently and the rest speak a little. You won't meet anyone who doesn't speak English at all.

Also compared to Thailand, you won't have to pay for girls except for maybe drinks or food if you decide to take them out but you don't have to.

Manila girls want money, they left their family to work there and many of them are busy working and they'll ask you for money if you chat with them online. Province girls won't ask for that. Many of them are at home no doing anything and they'll be super excited just to date a foreigner and spend time with him in a decent hotel.

Another tip: in Thailand, you can catch STDs, in the PH you can catch something far more dangerous: love. Don't fall for it or that will be the end of you. Never fall in love. PH girls don't want money from their boyfriend but once you get married, they will suck you dry (talking about your bank account, not your balls). So just go there to have fun, don't get serious with them. EVER. You can find as many girls as you can handle in one day for free so don't stick to one, no matter how good she is.

Many guys fall in love with the first 8 they meet, not knowing there are plenty of 9s and 10s around the corner. If you are a foreigner, you are a 10. Don't lower your expectations.

Destinations: Davao or Cebu if you like big cities, anything else if you are fine with small town. Avoid tourist destinations such as Palawan. Once again, the country itself is not attractive (except for the wonderful beaches but I'm not a seaside guy), you go there only for one thing: girls."

ask,fndo3qr,t1_fndcels,1586874214.0,Australia and NZ are amazing places but they are just far from everywhere. Why don't you guys makes super powerful engines and move the islands between Europe and the US?
ask,fndnmne,t3_g13l64,1586873944.0,"One think is true in the US: if you are a famous singer or actor there, you will become famous all over the world while if you are the most famous singer of France or the most famous actor of Russia, you could travel all over the world and nobody would recognize you. 

And if your company becomes big in the US, you'll probably open branches all over the world. You could have a big business in Italy or in Brazil and be stuck in your country.

For some reason, it seems that only something American can easily cross the borders and become international. They dominate the world's culture and their language is everywhere. I guess the US is today what the Roman Empire was in Europe 2000 years ago: the place that influence pretty much everything around itself.

But yeah, I'm also critical of it. They are obsessed with sex, military, guns but yet follow a hippie virgin god. They are obsessed with freedom but are less free than citizens of many countries, they are obsessed with democracy but seem not to realized that both the Rep and Dem parties endorsed Trump.

Funny indeed."
