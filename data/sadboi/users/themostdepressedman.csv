Case in point: at one time, sales executives would flat out lie to customers and send them to our team when something wasn't working like they were promised.

As an influx of calls get sent to directors, senior directors, and, eventually, presidents, the amount of complaints get tracked IF they are valid, non-user issues. While managers cannot allocate or control manpower/resources, higher level management can and will if they receive enough complaints. As a former tech, our recommendations for changes are ignored until a large number of people complain in regards to an issue."

But I have learned a single thing with my depression: by surviving and staying strong enough to avoid suicide, I can help others get through their issues since, many times, they are where I used to be.

When I'm depressed and it's at its worse, I'll be alone and thinking about how sad I am. And that will make me more sad. And I think about how much more sad I am. And then I get even sadder.

Counseling isn't about your family, your friends, your job, or anything else. It's about you. You may bring up these things or other things but this is about what things are doing to you and causing you to feel. If you haven't felt you can take these to your father, then it's his fault and I say that from a personal experience. I felt like my parents wouldn't listen to what I needed so I needed someone who would. I try to be their for my children so they know that they can bring anything to me without fear of repercussion.

depression,ewxz7ed,t3_cqowu6,1565871554.0,"Depression never fully goes away. It just becomes more manageable. From a scientific point, emotions are just chemical mixtures in the body and brain that produce an effect (this is a VERY simple summary of what actually happens). There are many factors that can cause emotions to occur such as food, lighting, weather, or even a nostalgic atmosphere. Physical issues are more controllable.

depression,ewba6lk,t3_cnk57j,1565262604.0,"Illness is a crazy thing. If she has a more prominent mental illness, she needs help that the hospital is, obviously, not giving her and not willing to give her. If it's a physical illness that is causing the depression, then that, also, needs to be addressed. Many people, who don't understand depression, don't understand why we are depressed or sad. They assume that we need to ""just not be sad"" as though we wake up and decide to be sad. We don't want to feel sad! We want to be happy! We want to feel ""normal"". This is not something we have complete control over. But we can do little things to feel less sad and depressed."
depression,ew899e1,t1_ew88ygy,1565205886.0,Not that depression is normal but depression is made to feel like those who suffer with it a psychotic monsters who are ready to snap at a moments notice.
depression,ew7xhaw,t1_ew7vwxc,1565199181.0,I agree but you don't leave your friend if they're your friend
depression,ew7pkyz,t3_cn7uwq,1565195336.0,That's depression for you. I have severe depression with being a disabled vet and I had some head trauma. So my memory is so messed up that I'm depressed because my memory is bad and my memory might be bad because of depression or because of the trauma. That's why I tell everyone to do things that make them happy because that depression spiral is neverending.
depression,ew7md4y,t3_cn7la3,1565193978.0,"Let me tell you about my grandmother: she didn't have depression and was a very pleasant person. She had gotten sick and didn't want to eat. Her doctor told her she needed to eat even if she didn't want to and that she'd leave us behind if she didn't. She forced herself to eat and eventually bounced back. That was over 20 years ago. From that one time I've realized that we sometimes need to do things not because we want to, but because others need us to. You may not feel like it but someone cares about you in your personal life. Coming from me, it says alot. I despise myself and feel as though I am irredeemable. I haven't robbed anyone, assaulted anyone, lied on anyone, or anything of that nature. I had to ask myself why I felt that I was so irredeemable if horrible people go around doing horrible things and feel like they deserve to live. I came to the conclusion that I'm beating myself up. I had to do what I needed to for my family and, if you've seen, I stay active in helping others on this subreddit because I want people to never be like me and hurt like I hurt."
depression,ew7kz8v,t3_cn7jht,1565193418.0,"Never use alcohol. Alcohol enhances the moods you feel and you don't have a choice in which mood will be enhanced. Alone, we tend to focus on the negative. In groups, we can help each other get positive. Find a group of people you can hang with or ask a therapist to recommend a plan for you. We're hurting, not insane and there's a clear difference."
depression,ew7kp02,t3_cn7joe,1565193284.0,"Contact the suicide hotline. Not because you're suicidal, but because they can provide resources to help you get the answers to your external abuse so that you can stop worrying about those and get your internal problems focused on."
depression,ew7kgwj,t3_cn7gle,1565193192.0,"I cry alot. I've gotten to the point where I can feel myself literally crying on the inside even when there are no tears on the outside. Some days are better than others. Some days, the outside overshadows the inside. If you can't find happiness in your life, seek someone to talk to. If you look in a mirror and only see that you look like a mess, ask someone else how you look. Instead of just saying it's a mess, they can tell you the good parts and what you can do to help your image. That's what therapist are supposed to do."
depression,ew7jy7n,t3_cn7gjj,1565192970.0,"Therapists should NEVER point out your flaws. We, being depressed, only see flaws. They should encourage us to look at our good points and realize that we are not irredeemable and broken beyond repair. If your therapist makes you feel worse, then it's time to change."
depression,ew7jmn4,t1_ew7j8lk,1565192833.0,Call him. Skype him. Find some online games that you can share. Have a few laughs. The internet is great because it allows us to be close while being far away.
depression,ew7jguu,t3_cn7a2f,1565192764.0,"I'm in the same boat. I feel as though I've wasted my life. We only get one life. I have been to many funerals for regular death, tragic death, and suicide. Everyone thinks back to the life that the deceased has lived because that's all that's left. We have one life and it doesn't have to be dictated by our flaws. It can be dictated by those we help. If I can help even one person avoid suicide, then it is worth it for me to not commit suicide myself."
depression,ew7j1ln,t3_cn7cnr,1565192586.0,"Grab him and go do something until the date night comes. If he's hurting, leaving him by himself won't fix it. Play chess at his house, play video games, go to a pet store. Do something other than doing nothing."
depression,ew7irn0,t3_cn79ps,1565192468.0,"Do the things you like eve of you don't feel like doing them. Why? If you don't do what you like to do, then you sit in a corner to yourself and think about how sad you are which makes you sadder and makes you think about how sad you are and wash, rinse, repeat into a downward spiral. Some happiness and temporary happiness is better than no happiness. Talk to someone if you need to."
depression,ew7idto,t1_ew7hsbe,1565192306.0,"Yeah, I do. I've been diagnosed with severe depression through the VA. I struggle to no end but I refuse to take medication only because I have so many medications now and my liver and kidneys had issues when I took all of them so I lay off unless I feel I really need it. I try to cope otherwise and just bottle up the emotions. Not healthy but I need to live as long as I can for my children."
depression,ew7hfdo,t1_ew7fwus,1565191892.0,We never understand. We always cry and lament the fact that we didn't know. We beat ourselves up because we didn't know. And we regret that we never stopped you. I have always thought that someone who committed suicide may have been able to help someone else succeed where that person feels they've failed. I've helped alot of people and I know because they tell me I've helped them. They've been successful.  None of them know how much depression I have and feel. And that's fine with me as long as they never suffer as I suffer.
depression,ew7gfgt,t3_cn71c4,1565191456.0,"No roasting at all but suicide is an unforgivable sin because you cannot atone for it and because you're taking something that isn't yours. It's better to think that you're taking something you can't give and atonement is for the living, not the dead. That's why I haven't gone for suicide myself. This is probably the most depressing statement ever but I'm hoping to live my life so that I'll be allowed in to heaven just so I can ask God to erase me from existence. I don't want to remember anything or look at my life. I regret it so much but I live to help others now."
depression,ew7fqjo,t1_ew7f25s,1565191154.0,"I thought that, too, but a representative told me that any time I feel like this is an emergency to them. We are people that hurt more than what we deserve to. We just want to be happy and we deserve to be happy and have happiness. I know I'm not one to talk but suffering is not normal and we shouldn't suffer constantly. Anywhere else, constant suffering is called torture and is illegal. We are being tortured and that's an emergency."
depression,ew7f5a2,t1_ew7eony,1565190898.0,"Yeah. The abuse is not there. I'm older than what people may think. I'm a disabled vet. My children are old enough to make important decisions. Just not old enough to make all decisions. My wife helps. I smile for people and wear the mask but it's all a mask, you know?"
depression,ew7eq0h,t1_ew7eiie,1565190715.0,The suicide hotline helps. They can talk things out and refer you to help that does not cost a thing.
depression,ew7emsg,t3_cn6ycb,1565190676.0,"Then they were never your friend. If you were a child molester, drug dealer, serial killer, etc., I could see them avoiding you because you'd be making others suffer. But you're the one suffering. Your friend should want to keep you from suffering and help you. A friend is a friend when you're up and down. What you had was a leech. And it's a good thing that they aren't in your life."
depression,ew7eav3,t3_cn6xgz,1565190533.0,"Let me tell you from experience:

The worst part of suicide is the people you leave behind. People will hurt more than you can imagine. A few months ago, a friend of mines shot himself. I had to help so many of our friends cope. And then it hit me and I cried so hard at work. I think about suicide often but no matter how much I don't care about hurting myself, I hurt at the thought of my actions hurting my loved ones."
depression,ew7dxyg,t3_cn6rxl,1565190378.0,"It could be the meds. I would look up symptoms of the medication to see if it is a thing. If it doesn't look like it, talk to your doctor because it still could be a thing."
depression,ew7dteh,t3_cn6nfo,1565190318.0,"Talk with a professional. Some things need to get off of your chest. Other things need to be worked on. This subreddit is a form of therapy but, no different than treatment for physical issues, emotional issues are not fixed by one thing alone. It takes several things to help heal and it's not always medication."
depression,ew7d67v,t1_ew7crjt,1565190017.0,"I still carry it. I hide it from my children as best as I can. Like I mentioned on another post, I'm going to push and encourage my children to be the best they can be and not let the world get them down about the things they love to do. Once they're grown, I'm probably going to get divorced and disappear somewhere in isolation. I feel that all I do is fail and disappoint. Even when I succeed, i fail."
