How about what you don't like and why.   
Imitation crab. Top ramen with an egg added in and some frozen veggies, cheese, a tablespoon of mayo and ketchup gives it a smooth zingy flavor! Raw veggies, canned veggies. Get a rice maker! You'll have rice at hand for when you want it and you can cook other foods in it without much worry of it burning because it shuts off automatically (mine is cheap kind that has the little weight button inside it, if it reaches a certain temperature, aka burning temp, it shuts off).

He was an intruder in your child's room, someone else could definitely have a quicker, more violent reaction to some unknown person being in their child's room.

You're temporarily excused until you're tested and approved\denied through mental health. It was pretty thorough and they ended up saying no work until you get some therapy under your belt.
