CoronavirusAustralia,fnexfwx,t3_g12hra,1586897643.0,Something to consider is that some people still need to pick things up to check the ingredients due to allergies or other dietary restrictions. I use the Coles app to see what is in stock at my local store and then google the ingredients for things I need in advance but I imagine that might be a bit difficult for some older people. Unless the supermarkets start printing the ingredients and sticking them next to the price tag a lot of people will still need to pick things up to check.
EatCheapAndHealthy,fneq7zr,t1_fnepq40,1586893900.0,Lmao. That's definitely a possibility! I don't know how I managed that... If you're curious I thought I was responding to something about people not eating the ends from a loaf of bread.

I have balance issues due to a spinal cord injury so I'm concerned whetstones would be too difficult for me to use properly without falling forwards a lot. The Apex edge pro looks like a really good option for me as I wouldn't need to lean forward to use it. I will definitely add it to my list of things I'm considering buying.

Obviously she is also trying to shop as little as possible though. There's also just the risk of bringing groceries into the house given how long the virus can last on plastic and cardboard. I'd prefer to be getting groceries as infrequently as possible. I've been brainstorming though and have come up with some easy food hacks that should make things easier. Hash browns in the toaster and overnight oats with dried fruit for example. I'm saving the microwave meals for the worst days. I'll get by. On the worst days I sometimes don't eat anyway so it would be nothing new.

Once I run out of what I have on hand I imagine there will be a lot of days where although I may have food in the house, it won't be food that I am well enough to prepare at the time.

Also bins with push pedals are the worst as they often have recessed lids stopping you from opening it with your hands. Those are luxuries I can live without though. A bed, toilet and shower are very essential, even more so than they are to an able bodied person who could at least use a bin as a toilet and sleep on the floor as a last resort."
