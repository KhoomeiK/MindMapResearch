ptsd,fm8846x,t3_ftlofn,1585844573.0,"As a sexual abuse victim I'm here if you need to talk.
I've had one relationship since my abuse and my partner was great. She was the first person I opened up to and helped me deal with it. For me I crave the companionship of someone, I love the idea of being in a romantic relationship but anything sexual scares me so so much. I remember the last time I had sex I just cried and I was so scared even with the person I loved. Now that relationship sadly ended I have no idea what to do. I want to grow and become a better person but I don't know how to do that by myself but on the other hand I don't want to start a relationship and use it just to get better (if that makes sense).

Balance is hard and scary. I don't know what to do."

I had a similar experience, I was tested for ASD when I was younger but all the Doctors said I was just a slow grower. I finally opened up to a therapist about it after a lot of people told me they presumed I was autistic from the way I was around people. I'm finally going for an assessment but sadly I got the letter 3 weeks ago and I have to wait 24 months... I hope everything works out for you!"

Since I don't know your son I can't say this is the reason but it was the reason I did it. I hope you find the answer to your problems!
ptsd,favrw0i,t3_eao0z7,1576361636.0,I haven't been in this situation but I know I would feel the same.

I can't look at anything sexual online or on tv and if it's a romantic scene in like a movie I have a full on panic attack. My ex (not the one who abused me) really tried to help me through it but since we've separated I feel like it's 10 times worse than it's ever been.
autism,fatpjpd,t3_ealmd0,1576340429.0,Thought I would give the reason why. This is the logo of the Spectrum organisation from the show Captain Scarlet. I used to watch it all the time with my dad. Just a fun little joke we have together.

I also just watch them for entertainment so I find it really sweet they calm him down. I also grew up on Pokemon and Ben 10 (the original) so he has great taste! 

Two things I see that these shows have in common are monsters and adventure so off the top of my head I have arecommendation, 
Hilda on netflix is a really sweet and relaxing show but sadly there isn't many episodes but it is really amazing. I even think you and your partner would enjoy it!

When I was his age I really cared about story but since I don't know your son I'm not too sure if he is! I mention this as I saw someone commenting that you should show him different monster anime like YuGiOh but from what I remember there is always a story that the seasons follow instead of Pokemon where you can put on a random episode most of the time.

When I was his age I did watch a lot of cartoons but I also watched a lot of live actions shows. Mostly my favourite show Doctor Who. I liked it because of the characters, most of the episodes are stand alone and the monster/alien designs. Sorry if he doesn't like live action shows, I just wanted to throw that in.

If I think of any more shows I will write a new comment. I hope you find something that works!"
