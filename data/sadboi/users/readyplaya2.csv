popping,esjyydt,t3_c82ymf,1562045952.0,Tonsil stones right? I get them too. Usually it feels like I have something stuck in my throat. End up looking in a mirror while flashing a light in my mouth  and see what looks like bread on the back of my throat. They come out in pieces but sometimes they come out whole. Smell terrible! Try using a water pik or a lighted tonsil stone pik. They have them on Amazon for like 8 bucks. Should help.

NSFWIAMA,eo8uk8b,t1_eo8rvkr,1558375148.0,"Actually it's not. Being that if a patient codes and there's no one there to respond the hospital can be held liable. Also, most places have a team in place to deal with codes with drs and nurses working on different floors. they have to call it over the hospital intercom in order for the code team respond. Also being that most hospitals are short staffed this is one way they try to compensate. 

But I will give you that not all patients will be monitored.  But very few aren't."
