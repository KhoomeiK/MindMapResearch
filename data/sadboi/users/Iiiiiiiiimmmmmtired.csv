teenagers,fn1j2n6,t1_fn0noq5,1586563070.0,I totally agree with you. When I was in like grade 7 we had this kid who called everyone in our class and told everyone he was gonna kill him self and hung up. Then  the next day came in crying to us about how he was so depressed and the next day was totally fine. I talk to him later on in life and he said it was just a publicity stunt and that really pissed me off. As someone who has actually tried to commit suicide it’s very hard to see people like this. It’s a weird feeling as well because people think it’s so cool and edgy but it’s just sad. There’s nothing cool about depression and it make me sad when people glorify it.

teenagers,fn1hsy3,t1_fn07vah,1586562301.0,"( I made a comment already saying this so it’s copy and paste with some edits because… lazy)

I actually agree with you even tho I am self diagnosed. I have a history of mental breakdowns, self harm, not eating, suicidal tendencies (the typical crap) and my family refuses to acknowledge it. Long story short it gets blamed on me being an aNgStY tEeN. It’s quite a painful because my father who **HAS DEPRESSION** (diagnosed and medicated) refuses to acknowledge the fact that his daughter is struggling , he won’t listen to me when I say that I want to be diagnosed and seek help and just calls me aNgStY and when I drop a joke about it (my only healthy coping mechanism) but anyway.

So now off of the copy and paste thing, I personally struggle to express my emotions to others especially women (I’m female and have a more typically masculine personality, some of my ex female friends broke my trust and gave me some serious trust issues relating to that and some other things) and that whole “*sAaAaAmE*” thing is the only way I can subtilely express my emotions, because my brain is the big stupid.

However I can actually give you some insight into why people are like that. I’m a giant empath, I cry when people cry, I get angry for others, i get happy for others and this has allowed me to have a very neutral view of people, besides my trust issues. People vent to me, people tell me secrets and people come to me when there’s an argument. So I know a lot, you basically have a 50-50 chance either the people saying that are hiding their mental issues or are they trying to seem reliable, edgy or they are just looking for attention and sympathy.

So take everything with a grain of salt and try not to  judge a book by its cover"

 I deal with fights this way, I’ve been told I’m extremely loyal for no reason, i broke up with my ex and I was (as my friend said) “a husk of a human. Flesh and a brain devoid of emotions”. He actually did some shity stuff (nothing illegal) he was just a massive dick.

I’ll sum it up like this I love my family they are a big part of my life but I feel very little affection towards my mother, I learned to deal with her and am now praised for my horrible ways of dealing with emotions. I bottle things up and at some point they come spilling out in a very bloody mess.The thing is I also see those articles that are like”*Xama came from no money and made a life for herself*”. They’re supposed to make you feel better but they often make you feel worse and pathetic because I’m privileged so I shouldn’t feel these things. I feel like I’m just making it up. The “affection” that you revive sometimes makes you feel worse. That feeling of being inadequate is normal. 

I understand your feeling of “resentment” towards people who can’t handle it. I got very good a consoling people for this reason, I feel like they should “suck it up” or “deal with it better” I found that the reason y i feel this is because this is how I see myself.

It’s been a year and I decided to be open. The girl I helped stopped talking to me and when I confronted her said I was to much to handle. Ye I make the occasional joke about my feelings, suicide-only in my close friend group-,self loathing, depression, therapy, etc 


It’s a weird twilight zone. She was in my friend group and would go on and onnnnnn about her daily struggles. Whilst I had to hide that I’m not really ok in the brain. I don’t joke about my health that often. I have a *very* dark seance of humor so I learned my place. 

I  think that we need to remove the stigma around mental health and at least talk about it. You only give a word more power if you don’t use it. You only fear a thing if it’s not talked about

Now this may sound odd but one of the ways I dealt with my trauma was to make jokes about it - I have a **VERY** dark sense of humour-. My view is that the one of the best ways to deal with something is to make a joke out of it, if she’s not comfortable with this approach it's **REALLY** ok it’s just one of the ways I dealt with mine. She should also try to join a support group, where she can talk freely about her experience. Tell her that she shouldn't feel sorry about not wanting to have sex, it's normal.
