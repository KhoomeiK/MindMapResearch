SuicideWatch,ffhnzvr,t3_etmk4x,1579944657.0,"Hey, you okay? 
I don‚Äôt really know how to respond to this. All I can really say is that I know one day, if you carry on, you will look back on these dark parts of your life and be so grateful you didn‚Äôt take this opportunity away from yourself. Maybe think of it as day by day. Baby steps. Just survive tomorrow. And if you feel like it, the next day too. 

I love you. Very much. I wish you all the best. 
Message me if you need <3"
SuicideWatch,ffhnttx,t1_fe03zef,1579944404.0,"Your life may be decent, and everything may look okay, but depression still happens. I‚Äôm very sorry to hear that. Please remember I am always here to talk if you want and I wish you the best. Remember, the world is a much better place with you in it. Ever feeling lonely, message me. This random person on the internet cares."
