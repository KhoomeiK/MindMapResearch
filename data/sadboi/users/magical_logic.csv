unpopularopinion,fq5bywb,t3_ggrfw8,1589099600.0,I am glad that I found one who do this. Milk and pizza is quite a good match...
unpopularopinion,fq2crr1,t3_ggj5k7,1589054897.0,"Agree with this. A few years ago, I was in a very bad situation and I seriously considered ending my life.  I told my situation and feeling to some other people and their reaction was normally just man-up, or I am weak, or there are people who are in harder situation. Fortunately I did not kill myself (the situation never get better but now I am changed somehow) but since then I do not talk how I feel to others as it does nothing."
modelmakers,fpttmhf,t3_gfbf1j,1588898020.0,Wow this is really awesome. Great job!
SuicideWatch,fpjnx8b,t3_gdsu6m,1588675470.0,Thats great! I also had my “last meal” and “last walk” years ago... turned out they are not the last.  I thought that I would die after one more meal and walk. And then I had just one more and one more.. and I am still here. Hope your situation gets better.

In many countries, the charge will be a few thousand dollars WITHOUT insurance (if not free), and will be $1000 or less with insurance."

The example I remember is ray-tracing where traversing object tree is the most time consuming part.  It first makes a tree with traditional left/right pointers, and then generate array-based tree for read-only task.  It is quite faster than pointer-based trees."
