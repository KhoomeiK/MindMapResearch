I just want to clarify that mental illness was mainly the cause for all that loss in my life and even made me feel like there was no point in trying. For the longest time I felt low, even suicidal whilst I was in my most recent job. Difficult part about it all is that I know I can’t just give up.

Other than that, I don’t bother with friendships with girls mostly because of my own bad experiences with them. When I’m speaking to a lad, it’s a lot more relaxed and you’re both cool about the shit you discuss. Kinda like a go out, grab a few beers and talk about random shit.

However, with girls I’ve known specifically, I’ve always found myself having to feel obliged in talking to them. Probably because of the amount of times I’ve been guilt tripped for not giving them enough attention or going days, possibly weeks without talking. Don’t get me wrong, there probably are girls out there I’d 100% get along with but I’m a lot more laidback/the ‘no strings attached’ type.

What I’d tell you is, get it off your mind and try to make sense of how you feel before forgetting about the whole thing. I’m not sure if therapy counselling is available to you, if it is take it up immediately. If you haven’t discussed it with your girlfriend either, I think you should talk it out with her, just know that not everyone understands."

It was pretty time consuming so I’d advise you take the time to look at other ways if you keep failing a certain story chapter’s episode."
