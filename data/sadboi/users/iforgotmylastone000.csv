yoga,fr59vcq,t1_fr49vjh,1589905020.0,"If you feel like you’re fighting, I suggest a yoga strap/small towel that you can grab behind your back instead of trying to clasp your hands. I had to do that for a while before I could keep my fingers interlocked. Start by grabbing it at the ends, and move closer to the center as it gets easier before you clasp your hands together. It’ll help you open up your chest if you do it gradually!

As a side note, you should never fight through a pose, even for less complex ones like this one! If you feel like you have to fight, it’s better to find a mod to make it easier so that you don’t hurt yourself! The pose will come as your body eases into it with mods, and I actually saw some pretty fast progress this way as opposed to slaving away trying to balance the pain I felt with the strength I was trying to achieve."
yoga,fr2rmb5,t3_gm7toh,1589842561.0,"Any poses where you have to grab your hands behind your back are choice for me. I’m a casual yogi so I don’t know names, but there’s one where you stand with your feet hip width apart, clasp your hands behind your back, and bend forward at the hip. Gravity pulls your hands down (or up, toward your head, depending on how you want to look at it) and it has always been a good stretch for me. This is something I do regularly at work now. 

I also really like twists! Supine twists are my faaaaaaaave. I always feel those in my shoulders/neck area.

ETA: maybe a focus on core building exercises can also help? But you have a teacher guiding you, so if they say the main problem is coming from the shoulders then I would just keep listening to them. It’s just in my experience, my core strength/overall posture heavily influences the tension issues I have, so I figured I would toss that in for consideration."

I don’t really like to think of it as “over” thinking, like “thinking to excess.” Because I find that my rate of thought doesn’t really change (I always think this much), but it’s the content of my thoughts that causes me anxiety. So I try to divert my focus, and/or trigger more frequent positive thoughts than negative ones. 

I have imagery that helps me with this. I’ll think of thoughts as planets with gravitational force. If I keep coming back to a certain thought I don’t like, I’ll imagine it as like... mars or something lol. Then I think “what is my ‘Jupiter’ thought?” Like, what thought is so much bigger that it draws my focus away from the negative? And I distract myself with other thinking until it overcomes the “gravitational pull” of the negative thinking. It’s a process, but it works. It’s like trying to get a song out of your head by replacing it with a different song that you like. I like doing it this way because I’m not yelling at myself to “STOP THINKING ABOUT IT” all the time, because I can’t just stop thinking.

On the issue of your roommate, I would look to get out of that situation whether or not you think your bipolar is affecting it. Some people just don't live well together, and it sounds like this person isnt the best influence for you anyways. However, your feelings probably wont just magically disappear -- these thoughts probably popped up in your head and then reinforced in the midst of this situation.

Also disassociating emotion from marketing words like luxury. I always say ""the only thing luxury is the price,"" and luxury is never kind for your wallet. In that sense, it's the opposite of self care. But my point is, it's just a word to make you feel justified for spending that much money. If you took off ""luxury"" and it just said ""face mask,"" would you really be buying it? Would the product be enough for YOU to decide if it's luxury, without someone planting the idea in your head? Does spending that much money really make the experience better?

You could also try making self care more of an event.  Like, if i'm gonna do a mask I'm also gonna run a bath and light some candles and grab a book. I'm not just gonna slap on my mask and veg in front of the tv if im looking for a relaxing moment, because that's my normal after work routine anyways.

Anxiety,fpgpi9w,t3_gdcfml,1588607159.0,"Are you sure there isn't any other underlying conditions?

Anxiety is often a comorbidity, meaning it can arise along with other conditions. It is as much a symptom as it is it's own disorder. I'm concerned that there is something else going on because you're getting worse even with the proper treatment for anxiety. If it's not working, it probably means there's something else going on. If you treat the something else the right way, then you'll see your anxiety diminish as a result.

Someone else mentioned fibromyalgia, but my mind jumped to epilepsy. We are not doctors, though, and these diagnoses require professional testing. The only way that you will see relief at this point is with medical help, and the doctors may have been misguided in treating you because the anxiety was always the primary concern. I would go back and focus on attending to your physical symptoms -- with or without anxiety, they are too severe to be avoiding doctors. 

It's also wise to consider any meds you may be taking and their side effects, or maybe withdrawals if you're switching or weaning off of meds."

Michigan,fpeoint,t1_fpdtr9p,1588551585.0,"They are refusing emotional service animals, and the definition of a service animal was only limited to a trained dog (i believe the actual law was updated entirely to reflect this part, not just for airlines). ESA's technically aren't service animals anyways because they never got the certification a service animal would. I found a reuters article on it that says airlines could request certain forms basically certifying that the animal is well trained enough to fly with. Apartments do this, too, I know.

So yeah, finding some reasonable accomodations for both sides would probably require some hashing out. I think the main reason that airlines did it was because they would be losing out on pet fees, but retail stores might not want to miss out on potential customers and receive bad PR for it at the same time so they wouldn't make a stink about it. I think the longer this goes on, the more of a chance that something like this pops up, though. 

Maybe contact tracing would be good for this reason? If someone enters a store without a mask, and they end up positive for covid and found to be putting others at risk, it's evidence that supports being more particular about the rules.

This is specified in the ADA Title III, as well as the federal civil rights act of 1964 for other protected classes (race, religion, etc). So not any reason. 

I'm just saying that I think the language of the law and the specifications in the executive order make this a little foggy without further case law in this situation. The executive order only exempts people from wearing a mask if they have a condition that prevents it, so putting a blanket rule on ""no masks"" is essentially discriminating against those people. Maybe not as overt as Jim Crow laws, but ""Whites Only"" ""Blacks Only"" and ""Masks Only"" all limit some people in some way. 

It's like how private businesses are mandated to have handicap spaces if their parking lot is a certain size. Or to have wheelchair accessibility into a building. If they didn't, then it's effectively discriminating against people that need those things because it disallows them from using the spaces that the rest of the public can use.

But thats just my wholly uneducated legal opinion (which i know is uneducated because i had to google ""de facto"" lol). 

Personally, I see this being a similar thing to service animals. Stores that don't normally allow animals will have the exception for a disabled person with a service animal, and from what I understand they can't ask about documentation, nor is anybody required to carry documentation for a service animal. 
 
This ended up being kind of a longwinded thought, but now that I think about it, does it matter if the person is lying about their disability? Like, if a person were to lie that they're going bare faced because of a disability, and the store turns them down anyways, does it matter if the person is actually disabled because the store would've turned them away regardless?

Definitely tell your therapist, because I'm afraid that these friends may be cut out of your life (which it sounds like you might be aware of, given your use of quotations in your post). There is nothing stopping him from turning your friends against you by gaslighting them, too. In fact, I'm afraid that he's getting into a relationship with friends of yours just for this. He sounds like a very controlling, manipulative person. He could be looking to play puppetmaster right now. Abusive people deliberate this way, so don't be surprised if it happens (""if"" -- maybe your friends are better than that). Tbh I wouldn't be surprised if he chose psychology specifically to prey on vulnerable people, as well as establishing his power with a formal degree. So he can use the ""I'm a psych major so you should listen to me because I already know more than you"" card.

But yeah, you'll definitely want your therapist in the know for this no matter how it goes. Keep whatever support system you have as healthy as you can, and maintain as much distance from him as possible. 

I struggle with the emotional apsect, too. My fiance and I have talked my outbursts over numerous times. What we've both come to realize is that these aren't normal spats, and they have to be approached more carefully. It takes effort and an incredible amount of patience from both him and I. We've just accepted that I'm going to cry a lot and have some irrational outbursts, and we focus on minimizing the damage as much as possible. SO much better and healthier for the both of us than just me trying to force myself into a neurotypical box. I wanted to share this with you to illustrate that a relationship (and the conflict within it) takes both people putting in effort, no matter what the circumstances are. Your ex was absolutely wrong in both the way he treated you, and his expectations for how you should act. You should not have had to shoulder that burden by yourself. 

You define your own emotions. You advocate for yourself. Only you know what is up inside of your head, and no one can dictate that for you, no matter how confusing it gets sometimes. I'm proud of the progress you've been making! It's never easy but I have faith in you."

And it's all about people just hanging out with each other, and it's all stuff that I do with people. Hanging out playing videogames, staying up all night talking, I just stayed in bed for 2 weeks quarantined with my fiance... more mundane moments that tay has been exemplifying lately. 

This has me thinking about how the majority of her songs on lover are about the longevity of relationships and what they grow into. This song shows how organic it is. How simple it is. The production is ethreal and dreamy, but the words are real life. Like it grew so naturally, you don't realize you're living a romantic fantasy until you slow a little bit and reflect on those moments. And even then, you kind of can't believe that you got quite so lucky.

It was so contrary to the current narrative and I was scratching my head at how easy it was.
Anxiety,fneoikr,t1_fnemc5h,1586893031.0,"That's hard to reframe. I'm having a similar experience. I flunked out because of hospitalization, and I've spent these past 5 years failing other classes that I tried to sign up for. I'm on academic probation for the second time, and I'm on track to pass my first class in those 5 years... but only one, after dropping my other classes for the semester. 

I don't know what would work best for you, but if it were me, I would definitely start with planning, and then I would focus on one thing on my list to tackle in baby steps and break it all wayyyyyy down. Even if you only work toward it for 5 min and then you can't handle it anymore because the anxiety becomes too much. The pessimist in me thinks it sucks to have to lower your expectations so much, but the optimist says it's a compromise for getting the task done, and getting the task done will (hopefully) help to instill some confidence. 

And since the progess is already small, there's no need to minimize it into nothing. Even if you quit after 5 min and the voice says ""you couldnt even hold on for 6?"" I answer back with ""no, but the 5 minutes still counts."" And you can always go back for another 5. At this stage, I believe that as long as you're trying, you're succeeding. 

Do you have a support or study group for this? I'm sure there's a community on reddit for med students and they may be able to help you out, even if it's just for some more relatable sympathy."
Anxiety,fnel0uf,t3_g19cw2,1586891259.0,"A few questions:

- What are you studying for? What is the goal? Do you have a lecture to prepare for, or an exam coming up?
- Are you doing well in school/in this class? Do you feel pressure to do better, either internally or externally?
- Do you have a comfortable spot to study? Do you have enough space to spread out papers, books, or your computer if you need it? Is this environment suited for study? (Quiet, limited distractions)
- Are you used to studying? Do you have a good method for it? Do you know how to study effectively?

These are all triggers for my anxiety related to studying and school, which is why I'm asking. I get uncomfortable when I don't have a clear goal for what I'm doing, if I feel a lot of pressure to perform well, if my environment doesn't feel right, or if I feel like I don't know what I'm doing. 

One of my strategies for productivity is making a list and planning what I'm about to do. Like, if I need to memorize vocabulary words (for example), my list would include finding all the words and their definitions, making flash cards, and then quizzing myself until I got all of them correct (or some of them, if there's a lot). Using the pomodoro technique also helps me, because I know I won't be locked into studying for too long before taking a break."

BipolarReddit,fmpdzwa,t3_fwgbd0,1586279147.0,"Everybody reacts to meds differently. Every med has common side effects. Every med will have an entire brochure of information when you pick it up from your pharmacist, filled with warnings and instructions and side effects. 

You can google a couple of the meds in this thread for their side effects. You'll find that they're similar in quantity and in content. Every single medication, no matter what someone else says, has the same potential to work horribly with you as it does fantastically, and you will not know that until you take them. This is why the relationship and communication with your doctor is so important, and why it is a bad idea to compare your treatment journey with someone else's.

Side effects aren't inherently bad, but they add complications. What really matters is your ability to cope with any that might pop up, and if that outweighs the benefit of treatment or not.

This is just a question with too much potential for misinformation about meds and treatment. It's valid for people to share their experiences, but the way this question is phrased has me concerned about the intent behind it. There's really no objective ""best"" medication."

I have to focus on correct breathing technique (diaphragm breathing) so that my shoulders relax down and back, and my chest can expand. 

I also do something like jumping jacks or pushups, or I'll wave my arms over my head and all around like a crazy person for about a minute to get some blood flowing and loosen up those muscles.

bipolar,fmbmg9b,t3_ftyte7,1585929225.0,"Nah, people communicate by trying to relate to each other and this is one way of doing that. Plenty of people have loved ones with the disorder, and even if they don't know what it's like to have it, they've seen what it does to people. 

For example, everybody at family christmas saw me with a shaved head from a manic episode, and the side effects from the pills I was taking after that. They didn't understand, but they saw how hard it was, and they respected that I had a life altering chronic condition. I would absolutely expect one of my cousins to say, ""My cousin has bipolar disorder, I've witnessed her struggle."" Because it's true. 

Were all in different places on the bipolar spectrum, so a person won't understand YOUR struggle specifically unless you share with them. In my experience, people with a direct connection like this are simply trying to empathize and I don't think that's inherently wrong or ignorant to say. I think of it as trying to bridge the gap for understanding.

What comes after it may be a different story, however. Seeing me the way I was didn't affect my cousins personally, but I've blown up on my immediately family members and done some pretty hurtful things to my sister during a manic episode. I would not blame a loved one who regarded me as more toxic because of my disorder, because there are instances where I was and my disorder was the reason. I think that their experiences with that are just as valid as mine."
BipolarReddit,fmbas1s,t3_fu83f0,1585922488.0,"Do you track your calories? That's the only way to know for sure. When I get manic I end up drinking wayyyyy more water, more caffeine, and I have less of an appetite as a result. My anxiety also goes through the roof so I feel nauseous more often, which also means less eating. I lost 30 lbs without trying or realizing it because of a manic episode that started last fall. I thought the same thing as you, I haven't changed ""what"" I eat... just how often I ate it. And then when I got depressed I got back into my stress eating habits.  

I have limited knowledge of IF, but I know part of the point is to not have to track calories. Even doing it for a few days to a week might be a good idea to give yourself a baseline. It's just hard to determine anything concrete without a bit of data. 

It's also possible that your hypo makes you more motivated to stick to your plan, which would explain the loss. Another possibility is that your current plan isn't sustainable in the long run and you're restricting too much, so you rebound hard when your motivation lapses. Again, hard to say without tracking.

The best person to talk to about this is a licensed professional. I know were social distancing, but you might be able to set up a virtual appointment with a nutritionist, or make an appointment with a doctor. Especially if you ARE tracking and you know you haven't had any changes -- there may be other underlying health conditions."
