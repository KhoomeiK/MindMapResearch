We would still talk and hang out like a friends with benefits thing. We were honestly still like a couple. Just last week after about a year she said she needs time and space away from me. I think this is the actual final break up and that she found someone. The pain is immobilizing and with this fuzzy depressed/anxious mind I feel so incredibly fed up with everything. I. Just want to go back in time and not do things that have destroyed me. I think its over for me.

getdisciplined,eqlpfak,t3_byq7aq,1560148054.0,My goodness I have felt the same way. I dont have kids and im single. But i also dont have parents to fall back on. For the longest time my house has been insanely messy and my job gave me the biggest stress ever. Same thing monday-friday 7 am to 8pm. Except traffic js like 45 mins. I also felt the same way as in what the fuck is the point of anything. Not in a suicidal way but in a not caring/not finding joy in many things except watch youtube videos and browse reddit/social media. Well it got so bad that i quit my well paying job because i literally would cry at work and waking up in the mornings had me physically feeling bad. But now financially im fucked because i literally make less than half of what i used to make. Worst part about it is for the past 3 weeks ive done nothing. Not even clean my house. Anyway i have no advice just wanted to share. At least today i finally started to clean so i got that going for me.

Whatcouldgowrong,eqakpz8,t1_eq9bfdc,1559934841.0,"Labor rates where im from range from $40-60 per hour. If was the front bumper then the quarter panel you say would be the fender here (metal panel located above the front wheels on either side) not sure if where you’re from its called the fender is called a quarter panel. Here if it would be what seems like a new fender and repairs to the front bumper it would be maybe 900-1200. But again it depends on the labor rate, if they got a new part vs a used part. Are you positive the part was changed with a new one?"
