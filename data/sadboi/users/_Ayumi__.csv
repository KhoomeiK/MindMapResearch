Osana,fnz24cl,t1_fnyxb1d,1587383841.0,"I know it's sound very cliché and every other artist say this, but practising is the key. You won't improve your art if you don't spend a lot of time drawing. Studying is important. Improving takes a time, but in the future you'll be pround of how much your art got better, so don't give up!

What I could really advice, maybe try using a darker and colder colors for shadows? But shading with black doesn't look good, so keep that in mind (I know you didn't use a black to shade in your drawing, but I wanted to clarify) Highlights are important too. Since using black for shadows doesnt look good, the same applies to white for highlights. Remember that nothing is pure white or black in real life.

There's a lot guides online about shading. Honestly you can even look at real photos to see how shadows work. References are also a thing! I can't really make any images for you right now. If you want some other suggestions or these images dm me and I'll try to help you as an artist myself XD I hope this helps you a little."
