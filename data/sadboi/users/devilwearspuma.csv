LasVegas,fqdqpz2,t3_gibxua,1589294922.0,"I'd say, in general, yes, the further you get from the center of the city the safer you are. gated won't make a difference, people can hop the fence in back or just wait to drive in when someone else opens it, the area is more crucial than the false security of a gate.

as someone who has grown up here I can also say with some confidence that the north side of any neighborhood in the valley is, for some reason, the worse side. north of downtown Henderson is rough- even if 89002 is safe, 89015 starts to get more run down and crime heavy. north of downtown Vegas is extremely rough, do not consider housing there. even the north side of ""green valley south"" past wigwam tends to go downhill for some reason.

also as a rule of thumb I tell people to avoid any place that is within walking distance of boulder highway."
confession,fqcak54,t3_ght6cu,1589253646.0,"that's wild that they took a bribe essentially to avoid getting police involved.

AskReddit,fpa34ge,t1_fp99zc7,1588439845.0,"I live at home and after I started working my parents, understandably, started asking me to pay for my own groceries, I quickly realized why poor people get takeout so frequently, you have $20 to last you til tomorrow, if you go to the store and try to buy all the ingredients to make a meal, you won't have enough, or you'll spend all of it and eat the same thing for two days straight, depending on what you want to make. if you go to taco bell you can only spend 1/4 of it and have some left over for gas to get you back to work or eat something else later on.

it seems ridiculous to pay ""more"" for fast food when you could just go grocery shopping and make three times the amount of meals at home for the same price, but it only works if you can buy a lot of different items and ingredients and plan out meals. living day to day or week to week you suddenly realize there's no way you can drop $100-$150 at the grocery store in one sitting, even if it means you'd save twice that amount over the week, because you only have $25 today, you're out of food and you're hungry and need gas to get to work tomorrow so you can keep getting paid. and you barely have any time at home to prepare meals or cook or even grocery shop because you're working so much. it's a weird vicious cycle."

NoStupidQuestions,fol4lsr,t3_g7trbx,1587854781.0,"my philosophy centers around ""do no harm"", which goes both ways, if an animal were attacking me I'd defend myself and if I was stranded in the woods for weeks without food I'd probably try to hunt something I needed to survive. but I don't feel like I need to survive by eating them in my everyday life, so I go without.

but if there's a bunch of damn ants in my house getting all up in my shit!!! there's literally no other way to get rid of them other than mass extermination. I do go out of my way to put spiders or scorpions outside, I'll even try to fan flies towards the open door rather than swat them, but ants are so invasive and numerous you either have to kill them and set up a bioweapon around the perimeter of your house to keep them from coming back or just be a weirdo living with thousands of ants in their home?"

I still get a minor breakout before my period around my chin area, maybe two or three, but they go away quickly and easily after a few days, and never get inflamed and severe. and the rest of my face is always clear. I think dry fasting permanently fixed whatever severe hormonal imbalance I was facing, cuz other than that not a lot has changed. periods are normal as well, but I am also a lot less stressed out now.

and while they were only 24hr I did do them very hard, no contact with water and it was summer in Vegas, extremely dry outside, and I even sat outside for a few minutes each day to meditate on my healing. during the first fast I felt the acne I had at that time sort of painfully pulsing on my face, they were very painful and I could tell the fast was doing something to them, but the next day not much had changed. did the second fast a few weeks later and the breakouts cleared up after that. hope this helps!"

confession,fo6yx0n,t3_g5xlpv,1587569281.0,"one time I saw a man panhandling at the edge of the lot outside our grocery store, he was obviously not homeless, at least not yet or not for very long, no backpack with all of his belongings or signs of wear on his clothes, crouched down with his head hanging and a sign that said something like ""never thought it would come to this, I can't feed my family, please help"" when I saw the car exiting in front of me hand him money I could see he was crying, someone obviously at the end of their rope about to lose everything and desperate for any kind of help. it's one of the saddest thing I've ever seen, it should never come to that point for anyone.

the next day he was gone and I've never seen him again, I like to think someone offered him a job and he was able to keep his head above water, but I now for a lot of people facing homelessness that's never the case. there's no support system in place to prevent people from losing everything when faced with insurmountable circumstances. if the government doesn't decide on a solution for people who just lost their job due to covid soon we're going to see a lot more people like him."

AskWomen,fnmj96u,t3_g2dxgq,1587072423.0,"basically all I've heard (especially as as a Vegas local) is that y'all use stripping as a front for the real business which is under the table prostitution in the private rooms. new girls start out thinking they're just going to dance and soon get pressured into giving extras for a larger tip and realize that's where the money actually is, and that unless a celeb comes into the club you aren't going to make thousands a night just dancing on stage, and that the whole strip club is just a facade for this behind the scenes stuff to happen. I don't really care either way, I think people should be allowed to do sex work if they want to, and strippers usually manage themselves and their own money (minus house fees which i think are bullshit but the club is basically the pimp bringing you work), so overall I have no issues with dancers.
