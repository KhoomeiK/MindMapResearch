2. I am presently married 

3. I had my self realization at 34

4. Came out to others limitedly at 34-present 

5. I’ve pretty much always identified as bisexual, but have been in a heterosexual marriage my entire adult life. 

6. When I was 13, I had a sleepover with a girl I always thought was cute. It caught me off guard when she asked me to have sex with her. I’d always been way prudish. We had the most passionate night, and I never experienced anything like it. I had make out sessions with other girls over the years, but generally under the guise of pleasing guys. 

7. I realized I was gay once it occurred to me that straight people probably don’t occupy their mind day in and out wondering if they are gay. 

8. When I was a young girl I remember watching the Playboy channel with my best friend. There was this shower scene with all women, one was wearing this native looking bone necklace. I can still remember how I felt, and I am still so turned on by chunky necklaces on a naked woman. 

9. Honestly, I still wish that I could just be straight because I have a great husband, a wonderful home and happy children. 

10. Advice to others, if you feel like you’re probably a lesbian, you’re probably a lesbian. Don’t deplete your mental health convincing yourself that your not. Don’t hurt men by pretending to be someone you aren’t, or trying to conform to what is expected of you."

I knew when I met both of my husbands that it wouldn’t last, on the alter I felt like a fraud and lair. They are both great people, but something was amiss. I loved them, but never in the way I have come to realize other women to love their husbands. 

I spent so much of my 20s and early 30s focused on getting my education, went in to a highly taxing career teaching. When I left teaching last year, everything finally slowed down. I had time to be in my own head. 

I questioned my sexuality all the time, but wondered if I was just overthinking things. Eventually, I realized that straight people don’t spend the majority of their thinking time debating whether or not they are gay. That’s what gay people living as straight people do. 

So I told a new coworker. She was so supportive. Then I slowly started telling people here and there, and I felt more validated. I told my husband who confronted me thinking I was pulling away because I was cheating. 

Now I’m in the last phase. Talking about selling the house, telling the kids & family and dissolving the marriage. I’m honestly really saddened by al of it. So much of my life is a dream. Our kids are so happy. But I guess pretending to be someone you aren’t will slowly kill you inside."

It just lead to frustration and caused *me* to be miserable, not the other person.

In example, my husband used to smoke. I HATED it. I was the worst at guilt tripping him, and making his life miserable by rattling off statistics, adding up how much he spent on cigarettes, accusing him of not caring about our family because he was risking cancer, playing detective like some lunatic, etc. I was right. All the facts were spot on.  But, I was making him miserable, and making myself even more so.

I remember a friend of mine came over one day, her husband was actually dying. I was going off about my husband smoking, and she told me to cut it out. She reminded me that I don't get to control other people. She validated me in that I was *right*, but at what cost?

Cookie cutter resumes will not get you a job, you are spot on. When applying for a government job you need to fine tune your resume. DO NOT SEND A BLANKET RESUME, I repeat, don't do it. Use an ATS scanner https://www.jobscan.co/ is a great one. Scan your resume with the job description, and it will give you a match rate. Then it becomes a game. Update the language in your application to reflect the job description. You want to keep doing this until you've hit around an 80% match rate. Here is how I would go about it: Print the description. Go through and look for repeated words for phrases, such as ""collaboration,"" ""analysis"" or ""attention to detail,"" highlight them. Get those target words in your resume and cover letter. Use STAR: Situation, Task, Action, Results to give specific examples of your work. Data is good. Avoid generalizations.

The key is really being specific and showing examples that exemplify what they are looking for. You can be a trailblazer once you are in the doors, but the application process is not the place to be unique. Show attention to detail by tailoring your application for every position you apply for. Talk about THAT position, use it by name. That will win over hiring committees every time. Once you get in the interview, let your soft skills show. They want to know that you're a good fit for their team. They already read your resume and decided you meet the minimum qualifications. Sell yourself. I like to use humor in my interviews. Interviews can be boring as hell. Be a candidate that makes interviewing feel like they are meeting with an old friend. Smile, laugh, bring water to buy time when you need to think on an answer. Also, remember that it's okay take a moment to think, or to ask to come back to a question if you need to think on it. Sometimes another question may jog our memory."
AskWomenOver30,fqhpg88,t1_fqh2vct,1589381753.0,"Hi, to answer your questions:


1. Teaching middle school is VERY stressful because the kids are between childhood and adulthood. They are erratic with emotions due to puberty, and lack in reasoning skills so they are often making poor behavior choices. I specifically worked for a small rural district with a very high rate of poverty (think around 80%). These communities generally struggle with issues of addiction, joblessness, and criminal behaviors because people have unmet needs. Children are very often effected by homelessness, neglect and abuse. This is a hard combination, because parental support is SO important in the equation of academically successful children. In my experience, I spent almost all of my teaching time practicing behavior management with no parental support. Administrators in these districts also tend to be sub par, so you can forget about that support as well. I wanted to teach due to the fact that I an an intellectual type person, and I wanted to share knowledge. This was not how things turned out.


2. I'd venture to say that as a nurse, you have many transferrable skills that you just don't realize. I felt the same way, very pigeon holed as a teacher. I never thought I would get out. What I would recommend is using search terms such as ""transferrable skills as a nurse"" for some good resources. In my state, we have a really great website (it looks archaic because it is managed by the state) with excellent information about different types of jobs https://www.qualityinfo.org/home.

I appreciate the perspective on the kids. They are so amazing. They have saved my life on multiple occasions and will never know it. I hope that you are right and when change happens, they will understand. Life is meaningless without them."
AskWomenOver30,fnspgep,t3_g3othm,1587226287.0,"Letting my mental health be a barrier to my success. I saw it as a disability, and let it define me and make excuses for me. 
I had a breakdown last year and quit a job that exasperated my anxiety (middle school teaching). I now work a job in data analytics and my anxiety is a huge benefit because I can solve problems all day long, and am great at detail work because I am so used to being hyper vigilant. 
I regret letting myself believe that I was damaged goods because of my anxiety. I’m not."
AskWomenOver30,fnsoej8,t3_g3odbt,1587225698.0,"Both personally. I feel like l love my 30s, because so much personal growth has happened here. My kids are amazing teenagers, and I love my job. I’ve been married 14 years and our house is humble and adorable. My life is mostly dreamy. 
BUT, in the midst of all the wonder and greatness, I have also come to the realization that I am gay and it consumes me. I am so depressed, suicidal at times. 
The only way to “fix” it is to start all over again. Starting all over again means potentially uprooting my children from their entire lives in the last for years I have with them. I don’t want our last years to be shit. I feel too old to start over. What if I die alone because this marriage was the best I ever get?"
worldnews,fn6ns8i,t1_fn44fwg,1586703654.0,"Honestly, I would suggest that invincibility complex plays in to this. We all go through it in our late teens and early 20s, but right now the consequences are dire. 
I’ve got a kiddo in their early 20s still going out with friends, traveling around, and getting pissed off and distancing themself from me when I try to talk to them about it, because I’m being “hostile.” 
Young 20s are right about everything, and everyone else is an idiot."

Pretty interesting stuff. I have always jokingly said I suffer from face blindness (I kind of do), but I know that I do actually experience long bouts of depression, often. I've never considered the two to be related.

I suppose this could be an easy case of correlation not equaling causation, because depressed folks are often introverts, and therefore experience less opportunities to study/recognize faces."

There is nothing requiring you to be around people who make you feel like shit, family or not. In fact, A simple “no” will suffice, and you are never required to justify your reasoning. You are a free agent. You’ll be better for not wasting your time on people who tear you down."

bestof,fiejfai,t3_f7mrjy,1582379512.0,"Because they largely are. I grew up a little punk rocker. May well had a giant target on my back. When I was 13 I was waiting for public transit, when an officer called me over. I walked over thinking he had associated me with a nearby group he had been taking to. I told him that I didn’t know the people, and he informed me that I was called over for (supposedly) spitting on the ground. I’ve never been a spitter, but he showed me some spit on the ground, and told me I had done it. 
What happened next was that I apologized(though I’m certain it was not my spit), but he wouldn’t let me leave. He searched me and put all things in evidence bags, and called for backup. A backup officer screeches up in a car, and this bitch had no idea I was being apprehended for spitting. These fucks put me in cuffs and threw me in the car. The female backup officer left bruises all over my arms pulling and pushing me around, she blew through traffic lights with sirens and lights. when we got to the station she opened my door and when I tried to get out of the car she shoved my back in because she “didn’t tell me to get up.” I had no idea HOW to be arrested, I was 13! So getting ARRESTED FOR SPITTING probably planted several thousand seeds of hatred for me. 
Another time at a transit stop, a few cars stopped my friends and I for “matching the description of a group they were looking for relating to a robbery” it was the dead of winter and freezing. We were forced to miss our bus because of interrogation, and when we tried to stand to close to one another or put our hands in our pockets for warmth one of the officers would draw his weapon and start screaming at us. 
So, I hate cops cause they have proven to be fuckers time and time again in my life."
