She would come in an out of my life. She would be gone for a year or so then pop back up then be gone for another few years pop back up. It was traumatizing. I acted out as a teen and looked for love from anyone to fill the void my mother left. I never realized my mom wasn’t normal until I left my my dad to live with her because she was so cool and let me do whatever I wanted.  I ended up acting as the parent in most situations and quickly moved back home. 

Save your daughter from that and get full custody and get your ex some psychological help so maybe one day she can be there for your daughter in a healthy way."

coparenting,fmpvo5h,t1_fmoyvyz,1586288184.0,If he’s been absent for as long as he has this might not be the best place to start out. The child’s only 2 and he’s been gone a year she may not know him or be comfortable going alone with him. He needs to earn the child’s trust before ha can take her away from the only parent she knows and I feel like that’s what the moms trying to get him to do and he’s choosing a woman over his child.
coparenting,fmn1r9f,t3_fw8v8y,1586216395.0,Keep the child with you the next time they’re there and tell her she can have the child back when she takes this seriously.

relationship_advice,fm1drll,t1_fm1andg,1585676578.0,She’s not gross for masturbating and she’s definitely not wrong for rejecting her husband or vice versa. My take on this isn’t that he was calling her gross just the fact that what she was doing was in a common area in their home. Some people aren’t comfortable with things like that outside the bedroom they’re not wrong for that. She knows her bf and amid that’s not something they normally do then she is in the wrong. If I walked in on my husband drinking out of the carton and said we gross. I’m not calling him gross or implying hat I find his disgusting just what he’s doing in the moment isn’t cool.
relationship_advice,fm1657y,t1_fm0o7hc,1585672702.0,Masturbating in the couch is gross. There are fluids everywhere. Couches are hard to clean. Guests sit on the couch. I would 100% tell my parent it’s gross to masturbate on my couch. Bed is different you typically have your own side. Your guests aren’t lying in it. The husband probably didn’t even notice the lingerie as the first thing he sees walking out of his office is his wife playing with herself on the COUCH.

Anyone can see that these are just two relationships that didn’t work out. The way you describe yourself sounds as if you are a great person who anyone would be lucky to get to know; but 2 children in general will limit your dating pool for quite some time.
