TodayYearsOld,fc8ud4u,t3_cx77no,1577542117.0,"I was supposed to read a tongue twister out in front of my English class that was like 'I saw a saw in Arkansas' and I didn't get the difficulty because I didn't know how to pronounce it properly either.

(I'm from Germany and top of my English class and was incredibly embarrassed.)"
AskReddit,fb08vap,t3_eauhhu,1576423742.0,"I suffer from depression and anxiety and some issues relating to food (had anorexia and do have body perception disorder), my meds aren't really working after I discontinued them for a while and I'm about to graduate - only problem is that due to my illness I miss a lot of school. I'm still almost top of the class, but my graduation is endangered anyway. 
Furthermore I did have severe social anxiety that got way better over the last years but friendships are hard for me to maintain and I'm difficult for people to be friends with. I have my best friend and my boyfriend and theoretically a few other good friends but practically not so much and therefore feel lonely a lot."
AskReddit,f95shk3,t3_e3vg54,1575134493.0,Needed a snapchat username when I was 13 or something and was snapping with some people I met on Instagram who didn't know my real name so I mixed up avada kedavra + alien and it just happened. It now is my user pretty much everywhere and all my friends are struggling to pronounce it.

I would've never met my current boyfriend and experienced what love has to be like and I would've missed out on my 18th birthday and I have formed amazing friendships that bring me more joy than anything else."
mentalhealth,f3wpxfr,t3_difvd3,1571214524.0,"This post is so damn important, because I feel a lot like I am and I know that some of my friends do, too. Whenever I can't attend school and there is no logical reason I feel like that, even though I know that my depressions and anxiety do not need a reason."
mentalhealth,f3wptkf,t3_dijt4y,1571214344.0,"I have a friend I cancel on a lot, and he still asks me to meet up and respects whenever I cancel and sometimes just makes me go out, even for a few minutes. For a long time I haven't appreciated that enough, but you're right: such people are like gold."
