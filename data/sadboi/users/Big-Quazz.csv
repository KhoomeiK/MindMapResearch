AskReddit,fn2botz,t1_fn1nro7,1586583611.0,"You're right, but also wrong. Not every ugly guy is labeled as a creep, and not everyone who is attractive gets a free pass. 

The point, is that on average, physical attraction does play a huge role in how perceive every aspect of another person. From likeability, to trustworthiness. 

Obviously there will be exceptions and outliers for lucky people, but you can't point at a few and dismiss the idea as a whole. It's also a compounding issue, rejections of that nature can snowball someone into even more self doubt so that's it's even more likely to happen or deter them from trying again. 

It's great that you can get past physical attraction, but don't think for a minute that your statement represents the majority or that there aren't ugly people with great personalities that will die alone. Life isn't fair, and it doesn't conform to anyone's ideals."

Advice for getting money fast, use all of your available energy and time each day. Without sprinklers, you'll want to invest into around 100-200 crops to water manually. Use the wiki to find which are the most profitable per season. 

Only plant 100-200 because you'll need to save yourself enough time and energy each day to farm the mines for sprinklers so that you can mass plant without spending all your time watering. 

Use any free time or excess energy for fishing or foraging so that you have money for tool upgrades and food."
worldnews,fma4n5v,t3_ftt3gi,1585883718.0,"It's not the cases have exactly doubled, it's just the accessibility for testing has increased so it's easier to get tested for people showing none to mild symptoms. 

There are many more people who've both had, and recovered from the Corona virus without even knowing they had it. 

Additionally, for the longest time testing was only available to those showing symptoms and had complications like pneumonia. If the only people able to get tested are already having serious complications, then it makes sense the death rate per confirmed case is so high. 

We need to take precautions in preventing the virus from spreading, but we also need to stop acting like it's some sort of lethal plague that's somehow worse than getting inside a motor vehicle everyday. I believe a quarantine will prevent more car accident deaths than Corona virus deaths overall.

pics,fl7cinh,t1_fl7368j,1584898925.0,"It's exceptionally dangerous to put women into combat roles like Infantry. I was an infantryman, and here a few things that might make it a bit difficult for women. I won't even mention a women's physical strength or conditioning either because honestly we have guns that work as equalizers. 

1. Routine extended periods (2+ weeks) without access to hygiene. No showers, limited change of clothes, and limited room to carry anything other than what's on the packing list. That might make the period cycle a bit dangerous. 

2. You don't want to hear about it, but dissention. Women already have, and will receive preferential treatment in these situations, especially by superior officers. Others get jealous, and people start to hate each other. 

3. You also don't want to hear this, but women in the Army are going to sleep with a lot of men. Especially when you lock them up in platoon that has 1-3 women and 60+ men. Which on extended deployments or training exercises is going to make even more people jealous and it will be incredibly dangerous for the women. 

4. Our enemies HATE women. Putting women on the frontlines for equality, means making them accessible by our enemies. Men get shot, women would be captured and raped repeatedly. Then when she's not useful for that anymore, they cut her head off, film it, and then send it to the US to watch the media play it on repeat."

Location data is useless In all but a few specific circumstances since it's only accurate when the physical card is used. It's impossible for anyone to use the physical card unless you've lost it or it was stolen since they all have chips now. Unless you're claiming someone stole your card, used it, and then put it back in your possession. 

Transactions done online don't have accurate location data. For example, uber will always show San Francisco on your debit card history and Amazon will always show Seattle even if you're sitting in New York shopping online. 

It was most likely denied because you didn't provide anything useful to substantiate a fraud claim, and it was only settled because you were aggressive and persistent. 

From there, decisions are made based on account history and yours likely has tons of notes left regarding the situation.  It's good you're considering swapping banks because you'll have a hard time disputing even obvious fraud moving forward. The first thing they'll see if you file a dispute in the future is that you've had one denied in the past, and that you pursued the issue until they provided the credit as a courtesy. 

You have to understand, disputes themselves are one of the leading causes of bank fraud. People buy something they want, and then dispute it as fraud to receive a credit. Keep in mind, that you're liable for the credit if it's removed even if you've already spent it. I've seen accounts overdrawn by thousands because someone thought they could pull one over on the bank."
