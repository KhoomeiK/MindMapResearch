Think of other things you achieve everyday even when you don’t want to. Focus on that. Then build on it. Recognise everything you do even if it’s shower. 
It’s hard but you are lovable. You are worthy and when you believe that you can have more confidence to not just see the diagnosis. 
I’m not saying it’s easy. It’s harder for us than others because we struggle to control stronger emotions but not all of those emotions are bad ones. There’s positive emotions we feel stronger too. Focus on those.

BorderlinePDisorder,fpnmr6x,t3_ge3oj2,1588767639.0,I have attempted when younger and think of it all the time. I wish you could explain the issue is needing help not just being told to stop. It’s hard to explain how intense you feel to someone who doesn’t. It rules my life but not theirs. Maybe that’s what I need to learn but it takes time so you need people around you to be patient. It’s also genetics sometimes I have three other family members diagnosed and I have kids so I need help learning for myself and to pass on coping and managing emotion incase they experience the same which is my biggest fear.

He sounds like a controlling emotional abuser who’s testing boundaries to see what he can do to get reactions and get away with.
