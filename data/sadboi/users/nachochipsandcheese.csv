Since you are so quick to judge someone for their path, maybe you should change your mentality? I've worked hard the last 6 years to find a path that fits what I want to do. As I said in an earlier comment, I had several majors and struggled in those. Again, I wasn't lazy, but the material didn't click with me. I even went as far as getting tutors on my own dime to make sure I wasn't lazy. Now that I'm finishing up, I would like to have a solid 3.0 instead of a 2.95. 

While I do understand how this might seem lazy, it's far from it. In fact, this is so common that a mentor and former professor advised I do this. Thanks for your concern, but I'm well aware of what I'm doing."

workingmoms,fjyzv5i,t1_fjyms71,1583708181.0,"> Many of the nannies seem confused about real world work policies. In the US lunches are unpaid too

So. This is not for all nannies. SOME young nannies, possibly. This is just a matter of her not fitting in with your expectations. I understand that you do not have the freedom to be on your phone at work, but I know other ""professionals over 35"" that do. Including teachers. To comment that nannies are not professionals is not okay. There are more career nannies than you think. 

Depending on the age of your kids, I think you're overreacting. Are you not on your phone while your kids are around? If it's all day and she's ignoring the children, that's the issue. 

Sometimes, nannying gets BORING. I love my NK... But she's older and wants to go in her room and journal or read alone. I let her. I obviously monitor her to make sure she's not doing things she's not supposed to be doing. When my NK was 7, we did a LOT more together. My phone and HW time was much less. 

I take my job very seriously as a nanny. I also take my internship very seriously. However, there are less opportunities during the day at my internship to check in with my spouse than at my NF home.

To sum it up, it sounds like she hasn't bonded with the kids. Maybe she's uncomfortable or anxious? Maybe this is her first time being a nanny? Or maybe she's not a good nanny. But giving her extra chores, especially if she's a new nanny, won't solve the issue. It will create a larger barrier in your relationship. A nanny should feel like family. Try asking her how she feels in the position. Maybe she's unhappy, too? 

Unfortunately, some people go into being a nanny because the money is good and not because they enjoy kids. My current NF is my last. They're also the longest family I've worked for BECAUSE they treat me like they value me. I'm not just ""the nanny"" I'm ""*my name*"" who just happens to be the nanny. 

I don't know if this helps with the insight from the other side, but I hope it can! There's a nanny for you and your family out there. It might take time!"

We call Big Sky little Kennesaw for Buckhead. 

Buckhead Saloon is cool on Sundays. I've never been on a Saturday. Hate Fridays there. Definitely give it a try. 

Havana is great. (Not near the other bars)

We like Moondogs when we're not in a ""dance"" mood. They are different than the other bars there since they have flip cup, pool, darts, edm room, beer pong, and other things. (It's further down the road but it's an easy walk from the bar section)

You'll have issues at every school. You're not going to find a school that receives raving views across the board. The amount of resources they have is amazing. KSU isn't perfect but I've found that they care more than other universities.

That being said and no matter what school you end up at, I hope you'll take these into consideration: 

1) go talk to advisors within your college or find one that has a good reputation. 

2) Take classes that will prepare you for your future and not an easy class. 

3) be involved. There's always a club for everything. 

4) Don't procrastinate. Yes, socializing is amazing and fun, but as a 26 year old STILL in her undergrad and procrastinated a LOT.... It's not worth it. 

5) Talk and interact with your professors. It seems like a brown nosing technique but you want to develop a professional relationship for letters of recommendation. 

6) Make time for yourself and your hobbies. 

7) Volunteering will help your resume. 

KSU specifically: 

1) Take advantage of every job fair, grad school fair, etc. 

2) the Owl Network is the best service I've ever seen for a university. You can find professionals in your field to help guide you. Take advantage of that."

We just moved to a more opened floor plan and the doesn’t have this option, so he just runs and pouts like a big ole baby."
BeardedDragons,eur542q,t3_ch9j4a,1563989657.0,"I’ve spoiled mine from day one. He slept on my chest to warm up (he was extremely cold and poorly cared for) and I was still figuring out the right bulbs for his tank. THEN I made the adorable mistake of getting him a small cat bed and blanket. He can sleep on his rocks, but he definitely prefers his bed 😂😂"
Nanny,euqed1s,t3_ch2mr4,1563976714.0,"That’s a HUGE step! Congrats!!! I babysat for a family with a child that is autistic. Goodbyes were always hard, even if I was going to be there the next morning, because he was scared I’d never come back."

Nanny,etvf8c1,t3_cdozft,1563233833.0,"Ahhhh yes. Gotta love it. My NF is Indian. I had to separate DB Mom and 16F, because she is not upholding Indian traditions. It set off a HUGE argument. She didn’t track in mud, just a whole lot of drama.

Also, what a hero you are!"
BeardedDragons,ettu30h,t1_ettp56d,1563196029.0,"She’s an odd one! Freaks out over the little things. I would watch Steve Irwin and she’d flip out. This is close to the [birthday prank](https://imgur.com/gallery/lkP2DCh) I pulled on her last year. I never give cards, because I think they’re dumb and too expensive, but this was perfect. 😂"
