Speaking of which, arguments on the base of invalidating someone's perspectives like that seem like they're under the impression of simply invalidating another person's opinion and not the impression of practising what it preaches by not allowing someone to do something they actually want to do, that being arguing against something with their own nonconformist points.

Really, any ""It's just an X, it doesn't affect you, you don't need to say anything about it, I'm so much better than you are,"" argument is more likely to influence someone to just...*not* accomplish *anything*, or take exclusive note of the flaws in something. It's quite a demeaning argument to continue to use, and I don't know why we should still use it. Oh, wait, I know why: fail-safe argument. If you don't have anything else to say, just invalidate it by saying ""It's just something that happens, don't debase it with your own ideas.
