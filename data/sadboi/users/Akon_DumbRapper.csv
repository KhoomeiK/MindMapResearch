Maybe add to the stickied post that the discussion is geared more for post diagnosis and we will be helpless to give prediagnosis advice other than to see a CRS or other specialist and probably to use sitz baths in the meantime. Maybe list specific questions to ask their doctor?"

AnalFistula,foyqtj4,t3_gabfjg,1588177475.0,"I would agree with the other commentor, to add my opinion, the sudden pain and blood can indicate tissue healing but the other discharge indicates infection. It may be either underlying or something that just needed an outward release. 

Sitz will not only help clean the area obviously, but will reduce tissue inflammation and promote blood flow within the tissue. Sitz are important part of healing. Don't psych yourself out of contacting your doctor. They will either want to schedule an appointment or will be able to at least give you professional medical advice and/or reassurance."

shittingadvice,fohl3se,t3_g73as9,1587767760.0,"I just read your whole history. Never heard of the masturbation problems you're describing, but in case you haven't discovered it yet, there is /r/nofap which is a support community for quitting masturbation if that's something you're interested in trying. 

A couple things to mention: pain killers aka opioids can cause really bad constipation, and over the counter pain relievers used long term can cause really bad stomach issues. I have Crohn's disease and I try my best to only use acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain but sometimes out does absolutely nothing. I also get semi regular tension headaches so I use Excedrin sparingly, but the aspirin in it is not good for the stomach over time. Ibuprofen used regularly also can cause issues.

I have had a somewhat similar surgery and deal with a condition called /r/analfistula which you may be interested in looking into. They can sometimes be caused or worsened by surgeries in that area, and can sometimes present with similar symptoms to a hemorrhoid. Surgery in the perianal region can also sometimes cause a tract to form between the skin and/or rectum, colon, and/or bladder, testicles, vagina, etc. Which is why I mention it since you describe the stool color being affected. I don't want to alarm you and I'm not saying this is what you are experiencing, but it may be something to do a bit of research on and mention to your doctors. It sounds like you want to speak with a colorectal surgeon specifically if possible regardless.

What, if anything was discovered during your endo and colonoscopies?"
TVRepair,fohfzf7,t3_g7gujj,1587765318.0,I would start by pulling off the back and disconnecting the front button board and ir receiver board from the main board. If the issue persists at that point then it's most likely to be a main board issue. You can physically check the main board and associated cables internally as well for bugs or shorts but I'm guessing the whole board may need replace.
TVRepair,fogwfyn,t3_g7aszb,1587757746.0,Probably PSU board or maybe led inverter board. Possibly led strips.
