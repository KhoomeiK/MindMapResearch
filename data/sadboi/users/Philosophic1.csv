They go as far as to say he isn’t a real Christian because... wait for it... BECAUSE OF HIS SINS. This isn’t something “the community must tackle”. The “community” of Christians in the real world is better than this. They know that this is a religion of forgiveness and acceptance of people how they are, not one of superiority and slander.

dating_advice,f7vlxi5,t1_f7u4h3a,1574024901.0,"I'll respond to your post in pieces as it was laid out.

First of all, I have no doubt that racism is alive, but it is not well. The majority of people are not racist any more. That's just the fortunate truth. You can talk about subconscious racism or whatever, but to held subconscious beliefs is not equitable to ""being racist"". There are those emboldened individuals who are compelled to say nasty things about people because of their skin color (and I'd mention that these people aren't just white), but as a whole most people are not racist in America in 2019. To think otherwise implies that you have a serious victim mentality that is perpetuated from the time we start school as kids.

Secondly, I am sorry to hear that about your mother and that would really suck to have people confront you about it. However, someone simply looking at an interracial couple does not make that person racist or even imply they are noticing that a couple is interracial. I am friends with an interracial couple in real life and they never talk about people staring and feeling uncomfortable. I think it is more about your mindset than the reality of the situation.

And touching back to the ""anti-racist"" comment I made; What I mean by anti-racists are people who specifically think that racism is such a problem that they spend their careers and lives in a constant state of seeing people as victims. They either see themselves or some other group of people as victims of this systemic racism. Those people are much more likely to take notice of a person's color and/or an interracial relationship because of the perceived challenges that must come with two different races dating each other. Truly racist people definitely also take note of interracial couples, but there are far less true racists than ""anti-racists"" as I described before. People who do not see color and truly don't think any differently of someone because of the color of their skin will not have any thought about a couple being interracial.

And also, how is it icky for me to say I wouldn't click with most black women? The OP literally said the same thing with races reversed lol? He literally laid out the problems faced by his interracial experiences. I know as a demographic black women have a lot of beliefs that do not line up with mine. That's what I meant when I said I wouldn't click with them. I also followed it up by saying I would never discount someone because of their skin color. When evaluating potential partners my checklist goes through a lot of things before even speaking to the person such as attractiveness, height, style, etc. Color isn't one of them. I would be lying to say I don't subconsciously notice their color but it doesn't affect my decision. A girl that is 8/10 but black is the same as a white 8/10 for me. Does that make more sense?"

I come from a very conservative town and I’m conservative & white myself and I can tell you I don’t stare at interracial couples when I see them. I find it to be kind of normal.

When you dive into the nuances you’ll find that most of the people who stare are probably the same people who are so anti-racist that they believe we should make concessions to minorities. In reality, people who don’t see color will not care about the color of your partner or their partner.

I would argue that you should not discount anyone because of their color. It’s fair to say most white women act in X type of way, but don’t discount them all. I’ve never dated a black girl but I wouldn’t be opposed to it even though I know I wouldn’t click with the majority of them. Just let things happen!

- Be less self-conscious than to worry about what other people think
- Most people aren't racist, so we should give them the benefit of the doubt
- I wouldn't discount someone based on the color of their skin

PoliticalDiscussion,f7l7u6n,t1_f7kz5h8,1573834593.0,"I’m sorry but you’re entirely wrong. Conservatism is not on some 5 minute delay and if you want proof then you should look at the positions held by conservatives today that were held by the anti-federalists at the start of our nation. States rights, small government, economic freedom, religious freedom, etc.

If we were progressives on a 5 minute delay then our entire philosophy would be fundamentally different than it was at the start of our nation. Instead, progress has been made on certain issues such as slavery, women’s rights, etc. but the right has maintained its stance in nearly every facet. Like I said, true conservatism is willing to make concessions where conserving something would do no good and where progress is inevitable and justifiable, such as women’s rights. But it does not budge on the belief that free markets = free people and that the government should not be able to control your life.

Where your view becomes skewed is the moment you only see conservatives in the light of “battles lost”. Yes, progressives sometimes push the standard left and bring the right with them (gay marriage), but the right also has the same effect. It’s truly a culture war, and the battle of ideas is not a dog pile dragging the right down a cliff. It’s a battle and one where the right has just as much to gain as the left.

Also, I’d mention that America has traditionally been right wing, not left. The American left has been farther right than the liberals of many other developed nations for a long time. Just look at how others have adopted government healthcare and gay rights. The American right has never been “leftist” on a world stage lol. The notion that they have is insane considering we spent 50 years in a Cold War against communism and leftist ideas.

PoliticalDiscussion,f7ktrkr,t1_f7kgtp2,1573825632.0,"I’m happy to debate semantics, but I think you’ve got it backwards.

It all depends on which political spectrum you use. The one that is taught in school (order vs. freedom) would have very confusing positions for conservatives and liberals today. The parties essentially flip flop on certain issues. The entire premise of the right is small government, so it makes no sense how they would line up on the “order” side of the spectrum.

A better scale is the two dimensional scale that puts economic ideology on the x-axis and government control/size on the y-axis. Then the parties are clearly right and left, with both moving farther away from authoritarianism. Most conservatives would find themselves in the bottom right side of the scale and most liberals in the bottom to mid left side of the scale.

Again though, this is all semantics and doesn’t change the fact that there’s nothing conservative about people who want to “conserve” outdated and broken systems. The principle of conservatism is to conserve things that still work. If it isn’t broke then don’t fix it. If it is broke, then we find a solution using the free market. 

Ethno-nationalism is authoritarian and can be on either side of the economic spectrum. So yes, there could be “liberal” white supremacists that want to have a socialist economy. That makes them no more liberal or associative with the Democratic Party’s platform."

PoliticalDiscussion,f7i3qgd,t3_dvn7kh,1573752375.0,"I'm not sure I can answer your question entirely, but I'll try.

I am a 19 year old college student. I am a proud conservative and would never back down from what I believe. I am majoring in political science and might some day run for public office in some capacity. I have been at events and seen the alt-right right infront of me. I have talked to members of the ""alt-right"".

The fact is that the alt-right really isn't right wing at all. The principle of conservatism, despite what Nick Fuentes would say, is not to ""conserve"" traditions. That might be the origins of the word, but that is not the modern definition just as liberalism is no longer equivalent to liberating or making more free. In reality, most conservatives I know and talk to believe that America is an open society to anyone who wants to come and play a contributing role in the country. The destinction is that the alt-right believes that people who are not like them (whether it be race, ethnicity, religion, etc.) cannot and will not assimilate, so therefore should be excluded entirely.

The entire principle of the alt-right is MORE government. They want a national religion, they want gay marriage outlawed, they want a national language, etc. They want the government to be MORE involved in people's lives, which is very distinguishing from true modern conservatives. Speaking as a conservative myself, I think the government needs to be less involved in people's every day lives. I believe homosexuality is wrong in a religious context but that the government should not outlaw it. I believe that America is a country founded on the blending of ideas and cultures and that as long as people's goals are the same (make America a better place), then anybody should be welcomed who is capable of fulfilling these goals. I believe that all men are created equal and that black, white, hispanic, and every other race or ethnicity should work together to build a great country. The strengthening of this extreme ethno-nationalist sentiment within the ranks of the conservative movement is frankly one of the scariest things I've witnessed.

And if you're like I was a year ago, you might not even believe that this sort of thing exists on a high enough level to make it noteworthy. However, I would encourage you to look up ""Nick Fuentes"" and take note of how many followers and fans he has. In his livestreams, there is endless flow of calls for ethno-nationalism and ""taking our country back"". If you're a true conservative this should concern you. If we have a split like this in our own party we could be eyeing down the END of the conservative movement and the creation of new factions.

dating_advice,f7goiq2,t3_dvx1ne,1573710632.0,"One thing I'll say is that ""practice girls"" are kinda necessary even if it sounds bad. You obviously use tinder, so set your preferences to a wide range for now and when you match with a cute girl from farther away that you are pretty sure you won't actually meet, you'll probably find it much easier to flirt. Since the potential isn't necessarily there and it doesn't matter if she completely is turned off by your flirting you won't worry as much about not coming on too strong.

Once you get over that fear, just playfully compliment them, tease them, egg them on, and ""annoy"" them. One that works for me is finding an endearing nickname that starts with the letter of their name (so if her name is courtney, then ""C"") and then refer to her in text as said name (such as ""cutie""). This works well because she will either get the gist and flirt back or she'll act like she's surprised you called her that, which you say ""oh damn autocorrect ;)"". It will make her laugh and at the very worst she'll be too contrived to flirt back, in which case you have your answer anyways.

dating_advice,f7gmtfi,t3_dvw6lx,1573708871.0,"Well, if you want to gauge her interest, you could always take a day or two off from texting her first. That will drive her crazy. I know there's that fear (and possibly a well deserved fear) in the back of your head saying that if you don't initiate that she will assume you don't like her and she will just lose interest. However, a lot of the time they don't realize how much they like you until they have to do without you for a while and then she will start overthinking.

When she starts overthinking, chances are she will text you. She might even ask why you haven't texted her. If she does that YOU'RE GOLDEN. And in the case that she doesn't initiate a conversation after not texting for a couple days, you can always initiate again and maybe explain why you were busy (don't apologize, just casually mention how hectic it's been).

Some other key points would be to not ignore her or anything if she does initiate (OBVIOUSLY). After your conversation naturally ends next time, just don't hit her up for like 48 hours. I would be willing to bet that she will text you sometime within those 48 hours, which almost certainly means that she's at least thinking about you enough to talk to you.

dating_advice,f7ap60y,t1_f7anddw,1573535329.0,And I’m not asking for any lmao. I’m just saying I don’t think that’s overthinking it. I legitimately don’t know how to mitigate that.
dating_advice,f7an975,t1_f7abra8,1573533805.0,And I get that. Thanks for the advice. I don’t think it’s overthinking to account for the fact that she may walk an opposite direction seconds after trying to start a conversation.
dating_advice,f79ymug,t1_f796h9k,1573517358.0,"Thanks for the well intentioned advice.

Let me just clarify, I’m not very socially awkward. I used to be but I’m kinda more outgoing now. It isn’t that I need advice on how to act around her, just kinda unsure of how to approach her after class when she might walk an entirely opposite direction than I do. Also she leaves alone, not with others so.."
dating_advice,f6xe7o0,t1_f6xdntw,1573247789.0,"If you said something about ""doing something after a beer"" and she replied ""if you're lucky ;)"" I think we both know what that means.

She's flirting w you dog. Definitely a good sign. Even if you didn't mean for it to come across that way, it was accidentally smooth lmao"
dating_advice,f6rm0c5,t3_dsre26,1573109354.0,"I always look at someone’s face before anything. Yeah a big butt and nice tits are good to look at, but I can’t be repulsed by someone’s facial features (lots of acne, bad teeth, spaced apart eyes).

I’d say you’ll do just fine :)"
Christianity,f6oc5mg,t1_f6o8n3x,1573013125.0,"It's always humorous when someone considers themselves to be on some high ground because they've been in a subreddit longer.

Actually, a controversial (and wrong) opinion on whether or not people can help being gay doesn't belong in a prayer request. That's like me saying ""please pray for all the people who are in extramarital affairs. They can't help it so pray for them to not be caught or face judgement for it!""

&#x200B;

I agreed with the parts that are right (gay people shouldn't be thrown off buildings/punished by law), but disagreed with the notion that literally disregards what the bible says about homosexuality."
Christianity,f6o0swm,t3_drywza,1573004914.0,"Making a bold statement like “being LGBT is not a choice” doesn’t really belong here. It’s a choice to act on your homosexual desires. It’s a sin and we should recognize it as such. I’ll pray for them to not be thrown off buildings, but also see the light of God and error of their ways."
Basketball,f6hhhy1,t3_drcrh9,1572848604.0,"One thing that helps me so much is when I am struggling to hit shots I run down a list of basic form mechanics to make sure I’m hitting each one.

Most important is if you’re starting the ball low near your waist when you shoot. I’ve learned that when I’m not thinking about it I’ll start up near my chest (most people do without realizing it). Start down at your waist. See if it doesn’t feel more consistent. It’s what all great shooters do.

That’s my two cents. Hope it helps."

Basketball,f6du89f,t1_f6crbvi,1572797105.0,"Right now Kyrie is averaging 30.5 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 7.5 assists this season shooting 44% from the field.

Curry's average before he got hurt was 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 6 assists shooting 40% from the field.

&#x200B;

So yes, right now Kyrie looks like he is better."
Basketball,f69v8ao,t1_f65y7zv,1572748008.0,Not really. Nobody is close but Curry lol
Basketball,f63gryd,t3_dq94la,1572677074.0,Kyrie 4 has a really wide base and pretty high ankle support. Maybe look into those.
Basketball,f63eypn,t3_dqfexx,1572676204.0,"Kyrie Irving is 6’3. He’s the best point guard in the NBA. As long as you practice your ball handling and guard skills, you can play whatever position you want."
depression,f5ssdgl,t1_f5sb1c4,1572441896.0,"Very constructive comment, thank you.

I didn’t even say anything offensive, but I’m sure attacking people on a subreddit for depression is a good way to solve problems."
