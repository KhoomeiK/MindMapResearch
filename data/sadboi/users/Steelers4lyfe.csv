Good to hear that the shift to prioritizing yourself has had similar effects. I've never been in an abusive romantic relationship but I've grown up in a turbulent (to put it lightly) household so I understand how much that can potentially fuck you up"

Amazing job getting up and going to the gym even when you donâ€™t feel like it, that takes some really really unrecognized strength. I have to warn you though, the gym life might become permanent once you inevitably get addicted to it ðŸ˜‰"

I do feel already some of the positive aspects you said, my empathy I already feel is way higher. Sometimes I would catch myself automatically judging people like bystanders for things like what theyâ€™re wearing or their vibe but now I realize that thatâ€™s pretty stupid and unhealthy. I canâ€™t know what anybody is going through, and everybodyâ€™s going through something. I feel that Iâ€™m going to try harder to be truly kind, warm, and understanding to everyone whether their plights are visibly external or not"

infp,et85bwu,t3_caa6mf,1562546947.0,"I told myself I would go to the gym everyday for 30 days and I could quit if I wanted to stop after that. Itâ€™s been 3 years now and I still go everyday and itâ€™s been the most life-changing decision Iâ€™ve ever made. Looking better is nice, but for me it totally boosts mental health, it feels so good to get out of my own head and into my body for a couple hours."

I believe in you!"
