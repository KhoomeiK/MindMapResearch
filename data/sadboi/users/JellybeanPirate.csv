BPD,flbj218,t3_fnk1kh,1585005658.0,"BPD is shit for dating. Especially when I'm not on the most effective meds and I don't see my therapist as much as I would like. 

I always fall hard in the first few months because I desperately want to have a future with someone. The relationship progresses super quickly and intensely, burns out in less than a year and I'm just like, ""oops I did it again."" 

Not to mention that both me and most of my partners have BPD. So it's just. Like. MAXIMUM FEELINGS. Which makes perspective on literally every issue impossible and I feel crazy 100% of the time."

BPD,fjtnxr2,t3_feiih5,1583609519.0,"I am always wondering if I would be better off alone. Or like, in strictly platonic relationships. I often feel suffocated in romantic relationships, especially since I have a tendency to constantly compromise my wants and needs to make my partner happy.

So if I'm with someone who isn't very similar to me, I slowly start to feel like I'm losing myself. I get super stir crazy, want to act out, and feel less and less love towards them. Which is really unhealthy. But all this is especially worsened when I try to talk to them about how I'm feeling, and nothing actually changes on their end. 

I've stopped giving into the belief that ""I haven't met the right person yet."" I know it's me. I haven't figured out how to overcome all the BPD shit that comes out in my relationships. I don't know if I'll ever figure it out."

BPD,fjtkuyh,t3_fegxgc,1583608708.0,"DAE see the least favorite qualities of yourself in someone else and develop an intense dislike for them? 

This happens to me all the time and it always takes me a while to figure out that I don't hate THEM, necessarily. I see myself in them and I hate myself. But it's so easy to judge other people instead of working on myself."
BPD,fjtk3iw,t1_fjsrm3r,1583608483.0,"Yeah I'm always trying to fuck up my life when things are finally going well again. Idk, what that's about, tbh."
BPD,fjtjjdi,t1_fjt3yn8,1583608393.0,"Yeah, regrets I have about the past make me want to split on the present. It's not so much silly mistakes on my end, but like, chapters of stupidity in different phases of life that make the context of the present seem like a sick joke. I then have weeks where I'm constantly thinking of how everything all went wrong,  wondering if there was anything at all I could have done in the past to avoid arriving in the current version of the present. Like, some days, every single choice I've ever made seems wrong. 

Suggestions for how to deal with it? My therapist says to remember the circumstances that created situations of the past where we could never have known the implications of our own actions. A result of a lack of knowledge, lack of experience, or being stuck in a powerless trauma phase that kept us from understanding things better. A better way to think about it: you can't put the pressure of adult wisdom on your younger self because children aren't adults. No kid will know how to navigate complicated situations perfectly. It would be weird to expect a kid to have all the right answers. Try to remove the weight of blame from the younger version of yourself. 

And it isn't always that easy. I often find myself rewatching memories of my early twenties and I have the impulse to scream ""Don't go in there!!"" Like I'm watching a horror movie starring an idiot main character. It's hard not to view myself as the idiot main character of a story someone else is writing and feeling powerless. 

But you have to catch those self critical judgements of your past self. Very quickly. And try to replace the negative thoughts about it with forgiving, positive reinforcement. Instead of ""you were so stupid,"" reframe it as "" this happened when you did not have the knowledge you have now. This was an unfortunate thing, but it's in the past and I've grown a lot since then."" Reframing the negative thoughts helps to keep them from gaining too much power."

Like it's PROBABLY more built up in my head how fuckin' shitty I am. But I can't let things go if any minor slip happens in front of my partner. Like if I snap at them a little, or make a passive aggressive comment that I know I didn't have to make, or if I can't get myself out of a bad mood when I'm around them. 

I'm usually okay about articulating what I'm going through and why, but not always. They're very understanding and validating, but I don't think I deserve that kind of leniency. That anyone should have to put up with me for any amount of time seems like an unreasonable request."
