But what I really meant was keyboard shortcuts: [https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf)

I guess, I want to hit ‚åòB to toggle file tree in ""sidebar"", ‚åòW to close current file, ‚å•+Arrow to move a line of code up, and so on. I guess I'd like for all the fancy, Emacs specific stuff to be hidden behind ‚åò‚áßP, where you just type what you're trying to achieve and get a selection of commands to choose from; like ‚åò‚áßP => type ""plu"" => get a list of plugins related settings and options (install new, settings, etc)

It feels like I want to be a cool kid using Emacs and enjoying Terminal life to the fullest, but want this Emacs be me-friendly, which is unlikely to happen since ""me"" likes VS Code a lot :/"

Along the lines of ‚åòO to open file, ‚åòN create new file, ‚áß‚å•+Arrow to duplicate line, ‚åò‚áßP for settings/commands and so forth.

I made an honest effort to move to Emacs last fall, struggled for about a week, memorized some key commands, but I'm not stoic enough to power through this pain :("

Even after hours and hours of tweaking hell knows what and trying to make things *just work*, and even somewhat succeeding, keybindings are an total showstopper. They makes me 10x slower on Emacs, and it's just not an option :(
