ptsd,fr03smi,t1_fqw9e71,1589782889.0,Thank you! I will try to be kind to myself.
ptsd,fqo7f3z,t1_fqlkvpr,1589509108.0,Thanks for your comment. I did get a little more sleep last night so I feel some better today. Still struggling but more grounded at least.
ptsd,fqkrgyu,t1_fqiiixg,1589434244.0,I'm so sorry things are so rough right now. I hope you feel better soon
ptsd,fqkibfi,t1_fqia9al,1589427931.0,It's always rough to have several good days and feel ok and then fall back into the PTSD spiral. Hope you feel better soon as well.

TalkTherapy,fqghfrs,t1_fqd2in2,1589346361.0,"I can totally relate to your last paragraph. Therapy is the only place I allow myself not to hide my issues. I didn't even realize how exhausting the hiding is until I started therapy, but it is sooo exhausting."
TalkTherapy,fqgh54f,t3_ghectc,1589346141.0,"Therapy was weird today. I have been in kind of a PTSD fog for the last week or so since something triggered a three day long flashback and several recent nightmares. It's like my brain can't formulate thoughts and full sentences, so I spent large chunks of my session in silence, trying to formulate what I wanted to say, and then getting frustrated and shutting down when I couldn't get my thoughts together. 

My T was understanding and just gave me space to try and pull it together. Thinking back on it now, I'm irritated with myself for basically wasting a session. I wish I could've been more focused and present. I'm glad tomorrow I have another session because I need a redo."
therapy,fqgfzco,t3_giafke,1589345292.0,"I liked my second therapist, but she wasn't specialized enough to help me fully with my PTSD. My current therapist (number 3) is amazing and is helping me a lot. So, three I guess? Not counting the therapist I saw when I was in an IOP."
TalkTherapy,fpql6lv,t3_gep9ow,1588825405.0,"I did a four week IOP last year and it was really helpful for me. For reference, I have depression, anxiety, and complex PTSD. My therapist referred me to the IOP because I needed a higher level of care to be stable enough to start EMDR with a trauma therapist. 

The program I was in focused a lot on coping skills. It was basically 3 hours of group therapy Mon-Fri, medication management, and an hour of individual therapy every week. I especially liked the group therapy and found it helpful to be around other people with similar backgrounds and illnesses. And I made a couple lasting friendships with other group members. 

Overall, I recommend giving it a shot. I was in really bad shape going into the program (suicide risk, frequent self-harming, etc) and I came out of it better equipped to handle things and do the work in individual therapy. Feel free to let me know if you have more questions!"
depression,fppkfy2,t3_gem759,1588803928.0,This is beautiful and it brought tears to my eyes. Glad you are still with us.
EMDR,fpbpfzo,t1_fpaqo5t,1588475453.0,"We use a program called Remote EMDR. I just have to log in and my therapist can remotely control the bilateral visual component. It works pretty well! She had me tapping my shoulders too one session, but it was distracting for me, so I just use the eye movements right now. I hope you find a way that works for you!"
CPTSD,fp4wr2t,t3_gb7k0r,1588309428.0,"Ugh, I know this feeling all too well. To be honest, this past year I've slowly started cutting out relationships like this. I have less ""friends"" as a result, but it's been way better to not have to do all the heavy lifting in a relationship with nothing in return. I hope you know that you aren't a burden and you deserve people in your life that put in effort for you."

TalkTherapy,fomzbh1,t1_fomjs6h,1587908280.0,Thank you so much for your comment. I'm so glad you have a supportive T as well. Sending the good vibes back at you in hopes that your depression fully lifts soon. We will both get through this!
TalkTherapy,fom856e,t3_g4jxoq,1587881141.0,"My depression has been super bad lately and it's making it so difficult to just exist and try to be functional. The intrusive/suicidal thoughts have really ramped up and my brain is just full of scary, unsafe things right now. 
Thankfully, my T has been very supportive and it's really made me trust her even more than I ever thought possible. She has been encouraging me to check-in with her if I'm struggling and having that extra communication and support has been so helpful. I'm going to keep fighting this because I'm not about to let depression win."

ptsd,fnnrwna,t3_g2sz0a,1587099934.0,"You're not alone. Some days are just an absolute shitshow with PTSD and often it comes seemingly out of nowhere. Intrusive thoughts are a symptom I struggle with a lot, especially at night when my brain isn't occupied with other stuff. I haven't found a way to avoid them so I just have to wait it out. If you need someone to talk to, my inbox is open."
TalkTherapy,fnngord,t3_g2hekk,1587091955.0,"It's such a good feeling to be able to fully tap into your emotions in therapy and completely let your guard down with your T. For me, it's absolutely a good use of therapy.

 It took a while before I was able to be that vulnerable with my T, but once I got there I never looked back. No apology is necessary for crying in therapy and I would bet your T was actually happy to be there with you to sit with your emotions."
EMDR,fnjouw6,t1_fnj2o3v,1587003591.0,"I did it today and it went well! I still prefer in person sessions, but I'm glad I can still make progress from home. Thanks for sharing your experience!"

EMDR,fng9vpv,t1_fng6a9o,1586926010.0,I hadn't even thought about using music/sound as an option. It's good to know there are some alternatives if the light doesn't work out. Thank you!
EMDR,fng9sqn,t1_fng0vi5,1586925947.0,"Thank you! I might ask my therapist about the self-tapping or the sounds to use along with the light. I'm used to using buzzers + light bar, so it will be an adjustment for sure."
EMDR,fng9nq7,t1_fng0v2o,1586925842.0,Thank you for your insight! I can't follow my therapist's hand movements either and prefer a combo of the light bar and bilateral buzzers. But hopefully it will work out okay to try from home.

CPTSD,fna0pri,t1_fn99try,1586788749.0,I totally agree. I keep myself really busy during the day so it all catches up with me at night.
CPTSD,fna0lg8,t1_fn996hr,1586788681.0,Absolutely. It is definitely like removing a mask at night.
CPTSD,fn942ir,t3_g0a4ia,1586758716.0,I take Pristiq and have had pretty good results. I have had bad side effects with other antidepressants but no issues with Pristiq. I take a small dose of Wellbutrin also and the two of them together keep my depression mostly under control. I hope it works out for you if you try it!
CPTSD,fn92fkn,t1_fn91nns,1586757191.0,I sometimes do the same and stay up until I'm too tired to have all the negative thoughts. I do have a therapist and I'm definitely planning on bringing this up to her this week. I really like your idea of keeping a list to talk about with your counselor -- I'm going to give that a try. Thanks for sharing your experience. My inbox is always open as well :)
TalkTherapy,fn45zlg,t3_fyukyl,1586634749.0,"I understand this feeling all too well. Definitely some depression behind it for me, but I have kind of pinpointed the feeling behind some of it too. It's like a restlessness because I feel like I don't belong anywhere.

Also, it's not your fault you feel this way. I hope you get to talk to your T soon."
TalkTherapy,fn2dnma,t3_fyxe1g,1586585410.0,"My therapist wanted to see me more in the beginning to help us build a solid therapeutic relationship before we started doing the real ""work."" I see mine twice weekly for trauma therapy/EMDR and have been for a while. I will drop down to once weekly when I get to a good place to do so, but my T is leaving that decision up to me. 

I would talk to your therapist and let her know that you need more contact right now to get to a place where you feel safe and trust her. If she isn't willing or able to give you that, she might just not be a good match. Finding a therapist that is a good fit can be difficult and take some trial and error, so don't be afraid to move on to another one if this T isn't able to help in the way you need. Best of luck!"
TalkTherapy,fmu0xmj,t3_fxcv6j,1586382532.0,So true!
EMDR,fmsdz67,t3_fx1mvu,1586353440.0,Buzzers and lights. It was more intense than lights alone and seemed to be more effective.
CPTSD,fmrd5a7,t3_fwnh7l,1586319826.0,"Yep, mine are still together and still toxic.  They make each other miserable for the most part and they would probably both be happier apart. As a kid I remember wishing they would just get divorced because it was awful to live with their fighting and my mother using me as her personal sounding board/therapist to complain about my dad.

Thankfully, I live 1000 miles away from their nonsense now. I still talk to them but way less than I used to and with lots more boundaries."
TalkTherapy,fmraspv,t1_fmkd6q5,1586318052.0,"A positive update: the lump is just a cyst, so I'm cancer-free. And I had a good session today surrounding all the feelings that this scare stirred up for me. Definitely feeling a lot of relief now."
TalkTherapy,fmklk4h,t1_fmkg56r,1586159203.0,Thank you for your words and your support. It means a lot.
TalkTherapy,fmklgvs,t1_fmkisey,1586159110.0,"Yeah, it's been overwhelming. Thank you so much for your words. I really appreciate this sub and how supportive y'all are."
TalkTherapy,fmkde3h,t1_fmjwvsb,1586151302.0,I feel you on the maternal stuff. I simultaneously love and hate how motherly my T feels to me. Sometimes it's super healing and other times it brings all kinds of attachment stuff up.
TalkTherapy,fmkd6q5,t3_fvpv86,1586151125.0,"I need a do-over for this week. I have been having some medical issues that have me pretty shook up and I'm basically just a bundle of anxiety. I have had hives off and on for a month and I spent Wednesday night in the ER because I had an episode of anaphylaxis caused by who even knows what. To top it all off, I have a lump in my breast that I have to have testing done on Tuesday to make sure it's not anything serious like cancer. 

I'm scared and I hate it because it feels like weakness. I keep reminding myself that it's probably nothing, but it hasn't stopped the racing thoughts and worries. I'm grateful I have therapy after my mammogram/ultrasound on Tuesday because I know I'm going to want support from my T and to talk about all of this. I have been trying to be strong all week and not burden anyone in my life with any of this, but I just want my T to hold space for me to not be strong for a minute. 

Anyway, thanks for listening to my rambling. I hope everyone on this sub is hanging in there with everything that's going on out there 💜"
TalkTherapy,fmkapqe,t3_fvpyvb,1586149051.0,I've had a similar dream before and it was awful. It dredged up a lot of attachment stuff and made me feel scared and insecure. I ended up bringing it up in session and I was glad I did. There was some important work to be done in that regard and I was able to get some reassurance from my T.
TalkTherapy,fm4o5uh,t1_fm4kwct,1585757729.0,Thank you :) It's a huge relief.

TalkTherapy,fm32kqw,t1_flz9z7r,1585711263.0,"I think it's totally ok for your T to serve as someone to check in on you and provide some extra support while the world is total chaos right now. Do you feel like it could help to have a conversation in session about reevaluating your therapy goals?

I feel the same way a lot about not being able to verbalize the deeper stuff. I'm thinking about having a conversation about therapy goals soon with my T because I honestly don't remember my goals from the beginning of working with her and I'm sure a lot of them would be different or more specific now."
TalkTherapy,fm31u3n,t1_fm1tkwt,1585710735.0,"I'm sorry you are having such a hard time right now. It's extra stressful to not be able to have in person sessions, and I totally agree that video calls are not as beneficial. I'm glad to hear you are sticking with it though. 

Is there anything you know that usually helps you when you're feeling unstable? I struggle with SH urges too, and I keep a list of distractions and soothing techniques that I make myself try before I get to the point of actual SH. It doesn't work every single time and it is definitely a battle that I have to continuously fight, but it does help overall.

I really hope you get to a better, more stable place soon and feel more connected to your T. If you ever need to talk, my inbox is always open!"
TalkTherapy,fm30v55,t3_frhwvo,1585710050.0,"My session today was really productive and left me in a good headspace. I was angry with my T last week and today I was open and honest about my feelings and my anger, which is something I wss afraid I wouldn't feel comfortable doing. She handled it well and we worked through it, which was healing for me. 

We also switched to phone sessions instead of video sessions due to technical difficulties. I know video sessions are preferred because of body language, but I prefer talking to my T on the phone because the video is distracting to me and I get frustrated when the sound cuts out or echoes or the screen freezes. So we are going to keep working over the phone. 

Also, my T told me today that she had been thinking about me a lot this week. I'm sure it was because of how much I struggled last week and she was concerned about me, but it felt good to hear. It reminded me how much she cares and that she also reflects on our time together. I'm feeling so calm and at peace right now, which is a nice break from the typical internal chaos. 

I hope everyone on this sub is staying safe and healthy!"
therapy,flxo2p2,t1_flwda23,1585586603.0,"I have insurance, but I got to pick my first therapist from a list of covered providers. Maybe once a month visits are more common than I thought? I'm sure it works ok for some, but definitely wouldn't for me!"
CPTSD,flw790c,t3_fr58oa,1585541555.0,"I take Pristiq and Wellbutrin for depression, lorazepam as needed for anxiety, trazodone for sleep, and prazosin for nightmares. It took some trial and error to get to this combo.

I was originally prescribed Lexapro for depression and I had a bad reaction to it. It made my depression/suicidal thoughts much worse. The Pristiq works much better for me, but I was still struggling with depression and intrusive thoughts after several months. So my psychiatrist added a small dose of Wellbutrin, which makes a huge difference for me. 

As far as what makes a doctor pick one antidepressant over another, it's hard to say. Some have kind of a standard ""go-to"" that they seem to pick to start, but everyone reacts differently to different psychiatric meds. My current psychiatrist is good about laying out some options, explaining benefits and side effects, and giving me some say in which path we take, which I really appreciate."
therapy,flw2ebf,t3_frifh2,1585537895.0,"Once a week seems to be typical. I go twice weekly, but I have anxiety, depression, and pretty severe PTSD. I think a lot of people wouldn't get much benefit from once monthly sessions, especially in the beginning when you're trying to build a trusting therapeutic relationship with your therapist. I would definitely be looking for someone who can accommodate more sessions if I were in your shoes. Best of luck!"
TalkTherapy,flr8qe1,t3_fqjs9v,1585415273.0,"This is so normal! And it definitely got better in time for me. There are still times that I feel anxious before therapy, like if I know I'm going to be talking about something super heavy or difficult. But overall, I've gotten way more comfortable and used to the routine of going to therapy. For reference, I've been seeing my current T for about 6 months. Best of luck!"
TalkTherapy,flmdswn,t1_fljtg3c,1585280917.0,"Yes, it definitely triggered a bunch of shame and fear of abandonment. I do think it will lead to a helpful discussion next session. Thanks for your words!"

EMDR,flc71ew,t3_fnqyg8,1585021589.0,"Thanks for the check-in! I have opted to do talk teletherapy during this time. My therapist is trained to do EMDR through teletherapy too, so that's an option if COVID lasts very long. But for now I'm just happy to still have the support of my therapist, even if it's a little weird to talk to each other through computer screens.  I hope everyone on this sub is doing okay and staying safe!"
TalkTherapy,flbytmo,t1_flba5eu,1585015796.0,Thanks! You are so right about seizing the opportunities to be vulnerable. Sometimes I forget to do just that and it's never as productive as when I do!
TalkTherapy,flabzpa,t3_fnm6d1,1584980859.0,"For me, trusting my T took a lot of practice. By practice I mean being vulnerable in small ways and testing the waters. I would disclose something small and when she didn't betray me or use it to hurt me, I would be able to divulge more the next time. Rinse and repeat and after six months of working together, she knows things about me that I haven't shared with any other person. 

What it feels like is harder to describe. But I guess the closest thing I could call it is being understood fully. It's comforting. But it takes time. I hope you get there soon because that's where the real therapy started for me. Best of luck!"

ptsd,fkwhqyd,t3_fl1ecl,1584592860.0,"Absolutely. PTSD has such an insidious way of making you constantly doubt yourself to the point where you feel like you're faking your symptoms. Therapy helps, but it's no easy thing to overcome. I hope that soon you get to a place where you trust yourself."
TalkTherapy,fkwhcru,t1_fkwci63,1584592526.0,"I like this a lot. Just one word could be all I need to get ""unstuck."" The therapy plateau to me feels like some sort of annoying avoidance strategy that my brain has put into place I guess to protect me from discussing hard things. And I dislike it because the times in the past I have been the most vulnerable with my T have been the most healing and productive sessions. 

Unfortunately it's not that I am doing a lot better and have nothing to talk about because things are okay. My coping skills have definitely improved as of late, but there is still a lot of trauma work to muddle through. I just have to allow myself to go there. I really trust my T and know I want to do the work with her. Writing this out, I feel like a lot of this is what I want to say to her next session, so I think I'm going to just tell her all of this. Thank you for your insight and your thought-provoking questions."
TalkTherapy,fkwgh0n,t1_fkw8bg8,1584591805.0,You are absolutely right. I sometimes forget to go all meta and talk about therapy in therapy. I'm definitely going to bring it up so we can figure it out together. Thanks for your insight!

ptsd,fk6k96u,t3_fgro3m,1583904759.0,"Not sure if it's the same thing that you're describing, but I have had flashbacks that caused so much fear/panic that I felt paralyzed temporarily. Couldn't move or talk, just frozen. As far as the unfocused/tired eyes, I'm wondering if you're maybe dissociating in those moments? The unfocused eyes happen to me when I am struggling with dissociation and having a hard time staying present."

TalkTherapy,fjwotfm,t1_fjv3woo,1583642167.0,I wouldn't be able to work with an aloof therapist either. I hope you have the opportunity to find a better fit!
TalkTherapy,fjwols6,t3_fc4kf5,1583642019.0,"So one thing that I've been working on in therapy is learning how to feel my emotions and not just dissociate every time an uncomfortable feeling comes up. And it's starting to work, I'm feeling more feelings. But the last couple days I've been feeling so much anger and it's just a super uncomfortable and kind of scary emotion. 

I am not a person that is ever quick to anger, so having such a short temper lately has made me feel really out of control. I have been trying everything to work through it in a healthy way -- exercising, journaling, etc. But it's like I'm stuck on this one emotion and can't feel anything else. I'm going to talk to my T about it on Tuesday, but does anyone have any suggestions for the meantime?"
CPTSD,fjpr454,t3_fen9pz,1583558821.0,"Yep! Although for me, it a lot of time starts as a really bad stomach cramp. If it gets severe, then I tend to get short of breath. My therapist has worked with me a lot on noticing emotions in my body, so now I tend to pick up on physical effects more quickly."
TalkTherapy,fjjbw7k,t3_fdkq0v,1583389676.0,"My T and I have talked about attachment several times since we originally discussed the maternal transference feelings I have with her. We talked about it a little the next session I think, but mostly it comes up when I'm in need of reassurance from her or scared she's going to abandon me (which is kind of frequently, but I'm working on it.)"
CPTSD,fjj53nw,t1_fjj3tga,1583383604.0,"Yes, that's exactly it! My therapist asked me to try and sum up the feeling in a few words today and the best I could come up with was ""visceral discomfort/unrest"""
CPTSD,fjho9x1,t1_fjhf3t4,1583351974.0,This all makes sense. Definitely rooted in the past for a lot of us!
CPTSD,fjho79x,t1_fjh3yjt,1583351934.0,That makes sense! I'm glad you were able to figure out your trigger.
CPTSD,fjho3g7,t1_fjhnidq,1583351876.0,I can relate to all of this. And my self-harm definitely flares up when this feeling is intense.
CPTSD,fjhn77b,t1_fjhiw2d,1583351382.0,It's good to know I'm not alone
CPTSD,fjgxht6,t1_fjgwvsr,1583337466.0,I hadn't thought about it but that's probably a big factor at play.
CPTSD,fjgxeyo,t1_fjgwai0,1583337421.0,Thanks for your perspective. I totally agree and I would definitely like to approach it the same way.
