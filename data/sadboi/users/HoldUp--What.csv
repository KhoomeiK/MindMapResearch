Is your grandmother on hospice care? If not home-based hospice could be a good option. They offer bereavement support before and after death (up to 13 months after death), which I think might be helpful for your mom.

One thing that I've seen that really helps patients and families is legacy work. There are examples online, and the hospice chaplains and social workers are great in that aspect (I'm a nurse, so I don't do much with that side, but I hear people talking about its helpfulness).

So for me, I'm actually (now) at subclinical status--that is to say, if I'd never been diagnosed in the first place, I wouldn't ""qualify"" for that diagnosis now because while I do have symptoms, they aren't wrecking my life. Good job with near perfect attendance, doing well in school, good insight, making good/rational decisions etc. No flashbacks or panic attacks in a long time. That wasn't always true.

See if it's really for you. 

I had a friend that I gave this advice to when she was considering nursing... she was a CNA less than 6 months before she decided healthcare wasn't for her. And that's okay, it's not for everyone who thinks it is.

I love working as a hospice nurse, but I do think people have sort of a romanticized view of what it really looks like.

My point here is there are a ton of options. If you want to work in a hospital, yeah, you're going to with 12s and some weekends. But you also have more days off.

I worked for a time at a facility for sexually abusive youth (SAY). SAY had behaviors that ranged from hypersexuality in public places (masturbating in class at a young age, exposing oneself etc) to offending on other children.

I don't have the statistics on hand, it's been a couple of years since I worked there. But the research shows that most SAY were victims of, or witnessed, physical and emotional abuse or neglect. Surprisingly, they were no more likely to have been sexually abused than the rest of the population.

So a chaotic childhood could very well explain your behaviors and symptoms, without necessarily pointing to sexual abuse."

Another major recommendation is therapy. I can't recommend it enough if it's an option for you. The ED is a coping mechanism. A bad one that becomes a bigger problem than what you were coping with in the first place. If you can find better coping mechanisms for what's really wrong, that can help."

I think people get really, really burnt out on all the bullshit that comes with it. And there is bullshit. Here's my secret--when I start feeling like I'm burnt out and dread the idea of walking back in, I find a new job. There's plenty of fields out there. Plenty of positions to fill. Finding a new job isn't a problem.

And that's a huge benefit. My husband has grown to hate the job he used to love, but can't find much that pays comparably, so he's stuck. As a nurse I'll never be stuck.

I've stayed away from floor nursing because I know I'd burn out fast. It's just not for me. I've done long term care (nursing home, assisted living, developmental disabilities), case management for Medicaid, psych (my one true love and I'm still doing that part time), and now hospice. I really love where I'm at.

And definitely DON'T do it for the money but I won't pretend that's not a perk. If I need a few hundred extra this month to cover a bill or something I want, I pick up an extra shift.

I schedule my breakdowns. No really. I keep busy (2 jobs + school + kids) and don't have time to fall apart on the fly. So say I have time free Thursday night. If things are getting really hard on, say, Tuesday, I tell myself ""okay self, we gotta boss up. We just have to keep it together until Thursday at 8:30. We can make it through until Thursday.""

Thursday night comes around. I put on a sad movie (Irreplaceable You works for me every time). I let myself fall apart, but I don't unpack and move in to that space. When the movie is over, I'm done. There's a timeline to it and I know that going in. I've got 97 (or whatever) minutes to let it all out, then it's time to wash my face and get back to life.

It's more doable than it sounds. When you've got a goal (make it to Thursday), it's easier to keep it together in the moment. When you know you have a timeline, it's easier to let it all out then bring it back together (instead of fighting the breakdown the whole way through).

First, it's normal to feel like you're drowning at an SNF. It's because you are. Everyone who denies that is just jaded.

One of my patients right now, their loved one is a nurse that never did much with end of life (ortho, primary care, that stuff). Even though she elected hospice for the pt, she's having a lot of trouble letting go of the nurse side--the idea that her loved one should fight, that we need to keep looking for a hail mary, that there's got to be SOMETHING we can do for everything.

Maybe an alternating air pressure mattress will keep that stage 1 from advancing (it won't, just looking at it you can tell there's deep tissue involvement, and at the end of life the body just isn't keeping up with skin integrity because it's trying to keep you alive). Maybe even though the hydrocodone isn't cutting it and she can barely swallow we shouldn't give her morphine until the very end. Maybe, maybe, maybe.
And what it comes down to, for her, is this: maybe if she had done something different, this wouldn't have happened.
