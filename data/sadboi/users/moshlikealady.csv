lexapro,fnp4kfk,t1_fnp469c,1587139098.0,I have bipolar depression so I have to take mine with an antipsychotic or I would try a different combo too. I didn’t do well on celexa or Prozac personally so I’m not sure what my options are going to be.

It's a contorted mishapen broken kind of grief. It's ugly. It makes people uncomfortable when you talk about it. The grief of the person wanes over time but the brutality lingers on. A separate beast of its own. But how I deal with it? I put one leg in my pants, then the other, I get up and I go. You just keep moving and hope one day it won't hurt so much. And that's not to say there isn't a large amount of work being done for me in therapy, but all in all, all you can do is keep going. As numbing as it's been. I'm deeply sorry for your loss, and I'm glad to have you here. Grief is isolating, and we don't want to be alone with this kind of weight."

lexapro,fjhctl0,t1_fjhbf0k,1583345650.0,Yes and an antipsychotic. The mood stabilizer really just helped with my moods. The antipsychotic helps with the racing thoughts and compulsions. I would recommend it more than the mood stabilizer.
lexapro,fjh6rh3,t3_fdepoj,1583342330.0,You could possibly have Bipolar II and the SSRI is triggering hypomania. I would talk to the pdoc about this.

Now that I'm diagnosed it's all more manageable and I am able to focus a lot more.
