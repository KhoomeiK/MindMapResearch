I’ll post an update in a few weeks but hopefully I skip the purge. 

But it may also have to do with the fact that right now I’m on vacation and not stressed/exposed to a lot of bacteria or sun. I’m hoping I’m just resilient lol

PlasticSurgery,euw77nl,t3_chpbu3,1564071583.0,"So I actually got sculpture done which I understand is more effective and safer than cool sculpting for around the same price point. 

I recommend it. I got my flanks and abs done a few years ago (3-4 treatments). I like my results. I didn’t have any pain or dude effects after the treatment, but the treatment itself was a little uncomfortable (but so is coolsculpting). My doctor offered both treatments and recommended sculpsure for me. I’d recommend you go to a board certified plastic surgeon who offers both treatments and see what he recommends based on your goals and needs. 

I went to Sean Doherty in Boston who was a PI on the FDA approval application for Sculpsure, but you can use RealSelf to find a good doctor. 

Good luck!"
