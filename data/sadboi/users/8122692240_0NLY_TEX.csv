AskReddit,ff5pqxk,t1_ff59tn2,1579605115.0,"I'm not speaking in an opinion oriented manner. I'm using definitions. Hypnogogia/pompia occurs alongside muscle atonia (sleep paralysis), and is responsible for the scary or neutral experiences people have during it. So you're partly right in that hypnogogia and muscle atonia are nothing alike. Muscle atonia is not characterized by hallucinations, it is only characterized by paralysis. It just happens to be accompanied by sleep phenomena such as visual, haptic, and aural hallucinations before and after going to sleep.

But they needn't occur at the same time. Sometimes you can have the hallucinations and not be paralyzed. Or you can be paralyzed without experiencing any weird sensations that aren't there. You don't need to be asleep during either, just near sleep, whether it's waling up or drifting off.

Muscle atonia prevents us from acting out our dreams. It occurs when the projections down the spinal cord from the motor cortex are inhibited."

Until, finally, when I am near or at 100% c, I would be completely motionless, mid stride, as you sat eating popcorn on the couch. Granted, I'm pretty far away, so you'd need the best binoculars the universe has to offer to see me. 

Now, let's acknowledge your food addiction. Your bag of popcorn is larger than you, so it took you a long while to finish. From your perspective, at least. From mine, though? Faster than I could even perceive, you finished the bag of popcorn, died of cardiac arrest, froze in the vaccum of space, and then our solar system was engulfed by our sun and then shrank back down after releasing a lot of energy from its supernova phase.

I also experienced the end of the universe, the heat death. And then whatever happens next, if anything.
