are these self harm episodes triggered by anything other than just a low mood? because you're transgender, you may experience dysphoria which can result in these behaviors. 

what kind of thoughts do you have when your mind is racing? 

how long do these periods last each? which is more prominent? 

how long have you been experiencing this? 

depending on the duration of this, and the length of the episodes, this may be a form of bipolar disorder. because it is interfering with your daily life and has resulted in things like expulsion and self-harm, it doesn't seem as though solely puberty is causing this."
