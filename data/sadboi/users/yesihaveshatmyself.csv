As I‚Äôve been told by friends and my GP it‚Äôs very common to test negative for Lyme but still have the infection due to the way the bacterium burrows into tissue and may not show up on a standard blood test. Only about 40% of Lyme carriers show any symptoms at all in the first few weeks and after that it is much more difficult to treat. People should be safer than sorry when it comes to treating Lyme. If you‚Äôve been bitten, take whatever antibiotics you can get and be vigilant if you are exposed."
educationalgifs,f8x8jrr,t3_e2dqc1,1574911235.0,"Removing the tick is not sufficient to avoid diseases (and ticks can transmit lots of diseases, tho Lyme is maybe the most serious.)

If you get bit by a tick you should go the your GP and request a two week antibiotic treatment regardless of symptoms. Many Lyme carriers have no symptoms for weeks, even months, and it gets more difficult to treat the longer you have it. People are rightfully wary of taking antibiotics, but I live in Lyme country and have seen it devastate peoples lives. Antibiotics are cheap and even a two-bit walk in clinic will usually give you two weeks of amoxicillin if you‚Äôre honest and tell them you‚Äôre worried.

Seriously, and especially if you‚Äôre in the northeast, don‚Äôt fuck around with ticks. Just last month a friend of mine was diagnosed with Lyme after being asymptomatic for months and suddenly being flat on his back. 20K in hospital bills later and the costs aren‚Äôt decreasing anytime soon, not to mention his poor health and inability to work. 

Fuck ticks. Fuck Lyme. 

(Also, prevention is key. Wear protective clothing when working in grassy or leafy environs and check yourself frequently, especially your crotch, pits, and hair. Tuck your pants into your socks. Wear long sleeves and pants even if it‚Äôs hot. Wear a hat. Use DEET. Don‚Äôt get Lyme.)"
