ptsd,fq8g8tc,t1_fq7rtbn,1589165505.0,I’m in therapy right now for emotion regulation. They say it’ll all tie in eventually.
BPD,fq46xxd,t1_fq3z2cw,1589074287.0,I smoke weed. But I’m a recovering addict so I don’t mess with anything else anymore. I appreciate anyone’s advice. Everybody has a different way of doing things. And I’m willing to try anything.
BPD,fq3yu70,t1_fq3xvvl,1589071838.0,I dissociate a lot as is. I have no control over that.
ptsd,fq3yo8x,t1_fq3y0l8,1589071791.0,Thank you. You too!
ptsd,fq3xrtd,t1_fq3xj2f,1589071509.0,Yeah they want me to do EMDR but they just want to make sure I’m equipped for it.
ptsd,fq3x4af,t1_fq3dkf8,1589071290.0,I just recently joined DBT for some other stuff. I’ve never really had trauma specific therapy.
ptsd,fq1th9s,t1_fq18jne,1589049074.0,Yeah I get that too. I still feel disgust with myself and it’s been well over 5 years since the last time I was assaulted.
ptsd,fq17ord,t3_gghq50,1589042890.0,I understand completely. My doctor says that I’m likely stressing myself out to the point of being sick.
BPD,fpxix9z,t1_fpxfn4p,1588983479.0,Exactly. And I know I’ll get in trouble for invading their privacy but what about them invading mine by telling all their friends how fucked up I am. It won’t matter in the end. I’m always the one who’s wrong in anything that happens. It’s always my fault and my doing.
BPD,fphoe62,t3_gdcjd4,1588624853.0,I understand this so hard
BPD,foq6b87,t1_foq3djd,1587984563.0,Oh my gosh I have seen the movie inside out a dozen times at least they show it all the time at the hospital I spent a lot of time in. It’s a good movie. I feel the same way about the way I feel when someone doesn’t reply.
BPD,fnzsmid,t1_fnyk61r,1587400043.0,I haven’t told my therapist yet because it’s group therapy on a video call and I’ve only had 2 sessions. Haven’t really been able to express anything yet. I would say no to most of those questions minus the relief if we were to break up. But I also know that people with BPD get attached to anyone even if they’re abusive. If you would like to DM me I can go a bit more into detail.
BPD,fnx02db,t1_fnvjvn2,1587328837.0,"Yeah I just started DBT I read a book a while back that I liked. I’m just tired of living in the past more then reality, I’m tired of hurting. I don’t know how people who don’t me could care if I died. You wouldn’t even know."
BPD,fnsl02h,t1_fns1110,1587223780.0,A conversation or just spending time with someone and they suddenly leave.
BPD,fnskv9q,t1_fnrgpiv,1587223704.0,I’ve been doing it since I was a kid over literally the smallest things sometimes the change would even work out in my favor and I’d still be upset because I had already made a plan for the future. I didn’t know why I got so upset so when I was an adolescent after a bunch of research I thought I had Aspergers.
BPD,fnskm9r,t1_fnr3f5n,1587223561.0,I’m so sorry that’s a perfectly ok reason to be upset. I think anyone would be
BPD,fnski68,t1_fnr06zi,1587223495.0,Oh my god same people don’t like that I have to know every detail possible about anything I do I ask too many questions and it’s annoying.
BPD,fnskcd6,t1_fnqy9md,1587223400.0,I’m a recovering alcoholic so I’m definitely used to the one step at a time. I work on it every day. At least the last few times I got upset about something in this manner I handled it semi okay. My panic attack was more centered to myself then lashing out at everyone else.
BPD,fnsk01z,t1_fnqp7lu,1587223202.0,Saaame I feel so bad for my partners seeing how I react to something like that
BPD,fnscpfb,t1_fnqc7ev,1587218710.0,"I practice not expecting anything with my relationship, but not really anywhere else. I’m in an open/poly relationship for the first time and I’ve had to learn that it’s very different from my monogamous relationships and that they don’t understand me very well. So I’ve learned to just drop my expectations of anything good happening. And prepare for the inevitable bad thing to happen"
BPD,fnscdum,t1_fnqblhb,1587218494.0,"Yeah I haven’t specifically gotten into this type of therapy yet, so I’m just trying to figure it out on my own at this point."
BPD,fnsc665,t1_fnq9nyz,1587218351.0,Oh god I’m the worst at taking things too seriously. Doesn’t help that I can’t sense sarcasm as well as some people can
BPD,fnsc2uu,t1_fnq9fjo,1587218291.0,That’s like me when I’m in the hospital. I’ve been hospitalized so much and I’ve noticed I start showing OCD symptoms when I am in there. Making sure all my clean socks are folded exactly the same and separated in a perfect line.
BPD,fnsbtdk,t1_fnq5ofi,1587218113.0,Yeah that’s what I’ve been working on lately. Acknowledging that I’m upset and it’s okay and calming myself down so I don’t have a crazy reaction. It’s so hard.
BorderlinePDisorder,fn89xzl,t3_g04u1l,1586737029.0,I’m in a poly relationship currently. I and one other person out of 3 have BPD. You can PM me if you have specific questions. I would definitely say it’s difficult but I’m not giving up.
ChildrenofDeadParents,fn1dq6f,t1_fn1dl1x,1586559890.0,I just do anything that makes me feel like I’m with her again. I talk to her even though I know she’ll never respond. But I know what she’d say. She’d always say she loves me no matter what. And I just try to remember that.
ChildrenofDeadParents,fn14bld,t1_fn145zj,1586554528.0,I try to do things that my mom would have loved to do with me. She loved camping and hiking just being one with nature. So I used to do that on her anniversary’s.
lgbt,fn13481,t1_fn0ppmu,1586553833.0,Same!
BPD,fn12qy6,t1_fn12mv9,1586553621.0,My life is scary. People feel overwhelmed by the shit I’ve gone through like somehow it negatively impacts then.
BPD,fn12lvp,t1_fn12gw4,1586553541.0,Sometimes. I feel like I just scare everyone away when I talk about my life.
BPD,fn128dn,t1_fn124mb,1586553331.0,Me neither. I feel like I always just want to go straight to talking about the shit hole that is my life.
BPD,fn11zjm,t3_fyov5t,1586553191.0,It’s not weird to look for friends on social media. Especially not right now with this pandemic making us all stay home. I’ll always talk if you want to. F22
ChildrenofDeadParents,fn0za5k,t1_fn0j155,1586551667.0,Thank you so much I’m sorry about your mom too.
u_MetalQueenEmily,fmzwu03,t1_fmyrhvz,1586531154.0,OP is the most beautiful woman I know inside and out. Unlike you who just seems to be a ugly human being on the inside probably just as much on the outside. You are just as disgusting as rapists and murderers.
ptsd,fmxg0wz,t1_fmvomtk,1586464298.0,Yeah I do paint and stuff during the day as to avoid just sitting in my depression. I try to do stuff I’ve never done before as to avoid triggering flashbacks. But they seem to just come and go whenever.
BPD,fmnoop8,t1_fmnmfry,1586231143.0,I understand that as I mentioned with the drinking.
BPD,fmnlqst,t3_fw78zp,1586229030.0,"First off it’s okay to have sex it’s okay to be a ‘slut’ as long as you are safe about it. Sex is not a bad thing don’t make yourself think that it is just because you’re doing it during bad times. I think your main concern should be the drinking. Drinking and BPD and strong sexual urges don’t mix very well, you could get hurt. Trust me I have been through that route. I’m sober now but I got hurt. You don’t want that. Work on one thing at a time though. You know you need the help again. That’s the first step. Our BPD almost mandates that we get help if we want to survive a healthy life."
ChildrenofDeadParents,fmgvtqo,t3_fv1qfn,1586059193.0,It’s been almost 6 years for my mom. I still have our fb messages.
Endo,fmgv8g6,t3_fv51bw,1586058735.0,"I struggle deeply with mental health issues. To the point of frequent hospitalizations. When my endo pain is kicking in it throws my mental health through a loop. Doesn’t matter if I was in a semi decent place, I won’t be anymore. I’ve had a lot of physical health stuff that has negatively impacted my mental health."
BPD,fmgboby,t1_fmfvybc,1586045465.0,Yeah I’m starting DBT In less then a week. So I’m sure that’ll help although it’ll be online so that should be interesting. I’ve kept journals in the past but when I write my emotions have a tendency to take over and I just don’t quite trust myself yet dealing with strong emotions.
BPD,fmfbw8g,t1_fmf7eum,1586024021.0,"Thank you. I do use the 5,4,3,2,1 grounding technique where I just focus on my 5 senses. But that really only helps when I’m dissociating."
BorderlinePDisorder,fm1s71p,t1_fm03h4z,1585684058.0,I felt the same way for a long time after we broke up. I swore off relationships after her. I thought I was just meant to be alone for the rest of my life. But that’s not true she just wasn’t right for me or wasn’t right at the time. I’m in another relationship and there are similar problems as there was with my ex but were working on them. No relationship will be successful if you don’t put in the work.
Endo,fm1rym9,t1_fm0durb,1585683937.0,Yeah a great majority of the time that’s how it is for me.
BorderlinePDisorder,flzs5v8,t3_fs3vs8,1585631905.0,"I feel like I just read my story. I was in this same position 2+ years ago. Engaged for 3 years to my high school sweet heart. Things were good for a while she knew I had a lot of mental health problems (didn’t know specifically BPD back then) then it was just too much for her. She started my lying to me and getting angry at me for everything. Everything was too much for her. I didn’t want to leave because I did love her and her dog was my ESA I loved that dog more then anything. I never ended up getting the strength to leave her. She left me and I ended up trying to kill myself because hello BPD, how did no one know. And I haven’t seen her or the dog I still love so much. I would leave as soon as possibly. You’re gonna end up getting hurt more then you already are if not."
BorderlinePDisorder,flzr895,t3_frrt8a,1585631109.0,I love this. Does anyone else have anything else like this. So I can show my partners
Endo,flzr2wy,t3_fs52hu,1585630984.0,Yes all the time. But I have frequent UTIs with no known reason and sometimes I’ll have all the symptoms of a UTI but I won’t actually have one.
BPD,fl2iyrp,t3_fm12by,1584752133.0,I do it all the time to fall asleep. Seems like the only way I can gain control of my thoughts
BorderlinePDisorder,fku4e9l,t3_fkpzcc,1584541999.0,Maybe this is something you can talk about and work through with your therapist! Exposure therapy is definitely a thing that exists and it can work. You’re therapist is probably the one and only person who is for sure listening and paying attention to you no matter what. They care and they’re getting paid for it. I would definitely suggest going somewhere away from your family If that makes you uncomfortable. You have to be comfortable to do therapy. You’ve got This
Endo,fkgbca3,t1_fke0ro9,1584154812.0,I meant for a full hysterectomy
Endo,fkd9zu8,t1_fkcrmu5,1584072227.0,I think it’s mainly that they think I’m too young to make the decision of whether or not I want biological children.
Endo,fkcp7mj,t1_fkc636l,1584057997.0,My age was the reason for me.
Endo,fk647zt,t1_fk62pdo,1583893369.0,Honestly just whatever will help with the pain. My periods and my wisdom teeth have been the most excruciating pain I have ever experienced and I have broken all my toes and fingers and a rib.
selfharm,fjlf8il,t3_fdzm4o,1583445584.0,11 years old and has been going on for 11 years.
BPD,fj3yon5,t3_fbfeq8,1582996241.0,I never even thought about that. I’m pretty much non-binary. Maybe that would help. But I feel mike at the end of the day we still have this disorder
BPD,fj3yk48,t1_fj3ygun,1582996159.0,I don’t know how to tell it was removed
BPD,fiybd14,t3_faie9i,1582836159.0,"Remember this is our BPD talking. Our brain is telling us everything is black and white that if they don’t want you then nobody will want you that it’s the end of the world but that’s not true. This is one person. One out of millions of people. You need and deserve someone who sees you for who you are, the good, bad and the ugly and still chooses to love you everyday. I promise that person is out there. But you will never find that person if you don’t learn to love yourself first. DM me if you need to talk"
BorderlinePDisorder,fiyb0ql,t3_fai8wj,1582835973.0,GET HELP. That’s the only way us with BPD will ever get through this life. Make your dad get help too. People need supports be each others supports.
BPD,fho29r3,t3_f3tjw3,1581739139.0,I hate that. Everyone I’ve dated says they feel like the have to walk on eggshells with me. I wish I could just shut up and stop.
BPD,fh8n5qe,t1_fh7ithu,1581363274.0,I do have a dissociative disorder but these are different. When I say very overwhelmed I’m talking screaming arguments that generally involve suicide threats (usually by me) and I’ll black out. The last time was an argument with my partners where I left and went for a walk and then an hour or so later I was at my dads with cuts on my thighs I was missing one of the shirts I was wearing and my house key. I also had my prescriptions out. I don’t remember how I got there I don’t remember cutting and I don’t remember if I took any pills. When I dissociate it generally feels like I’m watching my body from the outside and it’s generally cause by sensory overload
alcoholism,fh76h05,t3_f1iou0,1581316936.0,"I’m 22 and have been trying to get and stay sober for a couple years now. Since I was 19 actually. It is difficult being younger, especially in AA. But I do go I do have a sponsor. A lot of meetings will have descriptors as to what type of meeting it is and they do have young adult meetings. I found that I really clicked with the young adults at my home group. The one thing about AA is that no matter what age or background you have they will always take you in and there will always be someone there with a similar story. Stick it out it’ll be worth it I promise. DM me if you ever need to talk."
rape,fchpic9,t1_fcfz4gq,1577652709.0,I’m trying to find another. But I have a clinic and my clinic has to do everything for me.
mypartneristrans,fc3vhrv,t1_fc3tupm,1577399681.0,I don’t think she really likes any part of her. She feels like the only thing hrt has done is give her some boobs. I love every part of her. I don’t know how to make her believe me. She thinks I’m just saying it to make her feel better about not passing. She thinks I’m so much more attractive then her. But I think she’s so beautiful
rape,fc3rlld,t1_fc2zvlq,1577396862.0,Not anymore.
ChildrenofDeadParents,fbz7ife,t1_fbz768r,1577237504.0,Thank you so much. I appreciate your words greatly they mean a lot. It’s just like I had my life all planned out when I was younger I had a vague idea of how I wanted things to turn out for me. Then everything changed. Now I’m clueless
mypartneristrans,fbrve9m,t1_fbphwag,1577046665.0,Thank you I will try that
rape,fb825c1,t3_ebsmqt,1576604497.0,"Sex without consent is rape. Period. People who cannot give consent are children, people who are inebriated in any way and people who have a condition that leave them very detached from reality ie severe low functioning autism or dementia/Alzheimer’s. You fall under the category of not being able to consent. So did I many years ago. Unfortunately we were both raped."
BPD,fb2xkie,t1_fb2gte4,1576459635.0,I don’t really have anywhere I can go that would be less stressful. My roommates slash partners are constantly on the verge of committing suicide or hurting them selves. I’m so stressed out everywhere I go.
BorderlinePDisorder,fao9ziz,t1_fao9rr3,1576260117.0,Oh yeah I agree completely but unfortunately they did so now it is just referred to as being on the spectrum
BorderlinePDisorder,fao9qbb,t1_fao5017,1576259978.0,In 2013 Aspergers was removed from the DSM books in order to categorize all forms of autism under one umbrella term of Autism spectrum disorder. [Aspergers ](https://www.healthline.com/health/aspergers-symptoms-in-adults)
BorderlinePDisorder,fakhk7i,t3_e9lisa,1576167255.0,I understand where you’re coming from completely. But what I’ve been told about borderline personality disorder is that it is one of the few mental illnesss that can go into a remission of sorts. After you get the proper therapy and help that you need these disorders will become easier to handle on a daily basis. I highly suggest reading the book ‘Stronger than BPD’ by Debbie Corso. It’s a phenomenal book that really put things in perspective when it came to what I deal with regularly.
selfharm,fa1au2o,t3_e7dwib,1575767433.0,Hey there. I’m sorry you’re struggling so much right now. I understand right where you are at. I was engaged to a woman for 3 years after dating off and on for 9 years. And in one day I lost it all. I tried to kill myself and never saw her again. I planned my entire life around her. Everything I knew involved her in some way. I thought there was absolutely no way I was ever going to get over this and I set out to be alone for the rest of my life. I pushed everyone and everything away in fear of getting more hurt then I already was. Everyone leaves so why not right? I recently decided that that wasn’t working for me after almost two years post attempt.  Life is hard and it always will be but you can make it beautiful and fun by having the right people beside you. Yes everyone is going to leave you at some point because people die. But if you have the right people beside you those times will become easier. It gets better love. You can always message me if you need someone to talk to. I understand so much.
BPD,f9mzt30,t3_e5t6gr,1575473901.0,What is DBT like?
BPD,f9mzrpr,t1_f9m3qhp,1575473877.0,Yeah I did a little bit of EMDR after an attempt in 2018 and it sent me straight into a panic attack.
BPD,f9mzp3l,t1_f9lzi1z,1575473831.0,I’ve got a book on DBT as well and I love it.
selfharm,f54fnaz,t3_dmnk40,1571980551.0,All the time. I did all the time when I was younger too. I took pictures and saved them so I could look at later. I think it helped with the disassociating
u_MetalQueenEmily,f4yjd18,t1_f4y8pru,1571877820.0,Not possible
BPD,f4y2xrt,t3_dly4fy,1571871809.0,I’m just like that. When I was with my ex fiancé my only ‘friends’ were her friends. So they were only around with her. Without her I was alone. It’s very dark. Try finding people with similar interests or someone else with anxiety. It sounds complicated but it works.
u_MetalQueenEmily,f4y0w4h,t3_dm60br,1571871088.0,I love you
BPD,f4p2338,t3_dl9eor,1571713875.0,Some people are meant for open relationships some aren’t. You aren’t in the wrong by requesting to continue a monogamous relationship your partner isn’t wrong for wanting more. They came to you rather then just seeking sex from someone else so that’s a good thing. But if you don’t want to open the relationship up you need to express it. Maybe you aren’t meant to be.
ChildrenofDeadParents,f436j3e,t1_f40mh6v,1571338966.0,Thank you  I am already heavily dealing with addiction I had several years of sobriety till recently but I’m pushing through.

BPD,f3zwc9n,t3_dix3vz,1571278559.0,I feel the same way. And most medical professionals will just see a small mishap and us overreacting ‘like always’ but really it’s more like. Tired of this ALWAYS happening.
ChildrenofDeadParents,f30un69,t3_dez15a,1570562720.0,I think it’s what your mom would want. To have the opportunity to do something that she can’t help you do anymore.

BPD,f1gainv,t3_d9665b,1569463286.0,I don’t remember a great majority of my childhood. I really only remember the bad parts really. A lot of that has to do with some memories I repressed. But I’m sure some of it has to do with bpd too

alcoholism,f05xeyo,t1_f04iysj,1568422573.0,I wasn’t going for a repeat of that? I wasn’t posting my “pleasant” memories. I was posting about the one memory that’s been playing in my mind for repeat for weeks now. Trying to remember why I decided that was the last time and that I was done after that. Trying to figure out why the fuck I would decide to fuck all that up for a little coke. Sorry if I bothered you
