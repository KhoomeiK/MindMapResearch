But seriously that's pretty strict for someone who's just starting. That's going to be extremely difficult to maintain and almost everyone would fail that if they're already crippled with a porn addiction and probably won't try it again. A lot of people will just be turned off by the idea, like Infectedfrag already is, and slowly back away. I do like your idea, but as a starting point it just doesn't seem feasible."

The more dopamine you get from that thing, the higher on your brain's list of important things it is. Sex releases twice as much dopamine as food. Since porn abuses that dopamine release it ascends to the top of your brain's list of important things, and the brain thinks it's essential for survival. While you know that it's horrible and a waste of time, your brain has been conditioned to think of it as a necessity, which is why it's so difficult."

If you take put away all electronics for a day and just sit alone in your room, you'll either read out of boredom or start creating. You could try audiobooks, but those tend to be a lot more difficult for people to remember than actually reading the book. To combat that, you could read a copy of the book while listening to the audiobook, which does seem to work. Or, when you take a shower, slowly make the water temperature colder until you're standing in the coldest temperature for a couple minutes. If you don't thwart it by going on your phone right after, the cold shower is a great way to get you in a productive mindset, which should make it easier to read. If you're looking for a general sense of fascination with reading, then I'm not sure if you can force that upon yourself."
