He used ‘kink’ and BDSM as an excuse for doing what I recognize now as abusive, grooming behaviour. I was so desperate for this older guy to love me (frankly, for anyone to love me) that I just played the part of The Cool Girl and went along with it for like five months before breaking things off. I did it over the phone because I was scared of what he would do to me if I done don’t it in person, which should’ve been my first tip-off that things weren’t right in that ‘relationship.’ I didn’t realize until MONTHS later precisely what had happened to me. I quickly thereafter read a lot of feminist theory as part of healing myself from the utter shame + degradation I felt, and am staunchly kink-critical now.

it’s so strange to not be in school and/or working for the first time since i can really remember. i was able to accept a scholarship to an intensive classical language course at a highly regarded university this summer. it won’t count toward my degree (at a different school) and it’s completely paid for. it occurred to me the other day that i wouldn’t have been able to accept that scholarship if i’d been working 40 hours a week in a bar job all summer. i’ve been able to watch movies, call my parents nearly every day, study for my LSATs next spring, write poetry, spend more time with my partner & roommates, who are my second family. i’ve been able to accomplish so much without the pressure of work and school over my head. like you said, even though i can’t go out, it’s enjoyable.

plus, it’s sort of nice to know that it was never that i was incapable or lacked discipline, it was simply that i was dedicating so much mental space & energy, as well as actual time, to my basic economic survival. even though i miss bar work a little & love dearly the family business i work for, i dread having to go back :-/"

not necessarily advice on stretching, but an underrated, nutritious bulk food: textured vegetable protein. it’s cheap, shelf stable + can be used to round out recipes with minced meat in them (eg. bolognese, sloppy joes, tacos, etc.) and add a huge punch of protein. you can also make ‘meatballs,’ faux bacon bits, and veggie burgers/fritters out of the stuff, so i’ve been using it for a lot of meals lately.

also do not underestimate the amount of things you can do with a big sac of potatoes. vegetable hash is a staple for me (a broke college student) and typically includes cubing some protein like tofu or chicken, along with whatever veggies i have in the fridge and pan frying with spices (i like montreal steak spice) until crispy. top with cheese if you have any + whatever other condiments you have. a great ‘cleaning out the fridge’ meal imo. boil with some carrots and blend to make a ‘cheese’ sauce. make gnocchi at home with the kids — it’s deceptively easy + fun with tasty results! honestly the possibilities are endless with a large amount of potatoes.

it’s so entrenched in my consciousness at this point though; every time i expressed my attraction to women as being stronger than my attraction to men, i was ridiculed. i still am. always. so i continued to push it down and dismiss my own feelings. my attraction to women is always dismissed, largely because i’ve only had serious relationships with men. i’m twenty years old! i’m expected to handle male violence from childhood, but i don’t know what i’m talking about when i express a desire to choose to only date women? i am encouraged to not have a negative opinion of men, to give them another chance, to continue to be submissive to their endless, degrading advances, when they actively make my everyday life more difficult. when they largely only see me as an aesthetic object as opposed to a person with thoughts, feelings, and abilities. i’m starting to feel like i was a victim of compulsory heterosexuality. sucks pretty bad."

basically. i get paid based on how my body occupies physical space in the world + how well i perform femininity. it’s super demoralizing to know based on personal observation that i get paid less (ie tipped less by customers) on nights where i’m just not up to shaving my legs, wearing a ton of makeup, doing my hair, etc. i literally get to survive another week if i’m feminine enough. it feels gross, but it’s the easiest job for me while taking courses, the pay is good enough in my city, and, frankly, i’m damn good at it."
