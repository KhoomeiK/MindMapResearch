I guess the first signs of being realizing my lesbian identity was never feeling comfortable with calling myself bisexual, secretly hoping I was only a lesbian so I could just be with girls, and only calling myself bisexual because of one guy I thought I “liked”. Looking back on that one “crush”, I realized I was never attracted to him in anyway, and only wanted approval and validation in my own attractiveness. (Once he gave it to me, I pretty much forgot about him.) Also, always thought “well, I could fall in love with a guy”. Note the “could” and not “would”.

With my middle school guy crush, I can recall feeling nervous, but mostly feeling unabashedly angry at him and wanting to beat the ever living shit out of him all the time. (I was an anime fan, and I thought that meant I was a “tsundere” per se. Cringeworthy, I know, but I was only 12!) I hated the idea of being his submissive little girlfriend that swooned over him - since to be honest, even 12 year old me could see there was nothing about him to really swoon over. (Yeah yeah, many adults have told me that “not all dudes are like that” and blah blah blah, but I honestly think if I just met a nice dude who wasn’t a typical “macho/chad” and didn’t treat me as his submissive girlfriend, then I’d just be friends with him.)

comphet,ex0qatj,t1_ex0najz,1565919571.0,"The most uncomfortable I ever felt with him was in our “relationship”. The story of how we got “together” is kinda odd.

Basically we were supposed to meet up with a good friend of mine and we were the first two to arrive. He confessed to me and popped the question of dating immediately. I didn’t want to make the rest of the meeting awkward (since, well, he did just do it at the very beginning of it) and I figured I may have old feelings for him that might resurface, so I said yes. Once our friend got there, he told her that we were dating, and I can remember my stomach just dropping. Then he put his arm around me, which felt kinda weird so I kinda tried to just ignore it. (I guess this is kinda PDA, which I’ve always hated. It makes me feel like I’m being owned as “his girl”, and I don’t want to be.)

Then came the texting, in which he’d text me good morning/night and make plans for our date. Not bad, I know, but I honestly dreaded texting him. I remember once hearing about a girl who was sickened every time her boyfriend sent her “I love you” messages, and I can remember thinking how awful that was of her. Well, that’s exactly how I felt when he sent me the same thing, so now I understand her. 

This whole week stressed me the fuck out so I ended it with him. He basically rushed everything and I was uncomfortable doing all that stuff (even stuff where I didn’t have to see him face-to-face like texting). I hated that feeling of being trapped and having to only look at him and do things with him and not with other girls."

Ask yourself: would you be willing to do that relationship stuff with girls without feeling like you have to? 

I know when I “dated” my dude friend that I felt horribly depressed and anxious since I felt like I had to give up girls and had to do all that PDA shit with him (which I honestly never wanted to do). I felt so relieved when I ended it, and I knew I never wanted to feel that awful feeling of being trapped in a relationship with a guy ever again.
