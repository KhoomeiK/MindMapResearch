mentalhealth,fp5n3xq,t3_gb6kuf,1588334887.0,"> I didn’t think much of this but the next day my dad told me that one of  the parents called me a spoiled brat as soon as I left with my mom to  the car. 

I'm not sure how this indicates that you're a spoiled brat, maybe that you were just scared of the dark and had some kind of underlying fear that was identifiable at the time that kept you from wanting to go outside while it was dark. Have you ever ran into situations where something stressful occurred in the dark, maybe even on several occasions, and also made you anxious? If so, do you feel as if you ran across instances where similar circumstances seemed to arrive while you were alone and in the dark? Why do you think that you had this fear? Don't force yourself to think of something if you can't, but try to.

> Looking back, yeah it is rude of me but I don’t think they was the correct parental way to go about things. 

That does seem rude, but you also seem to be taking ownership for that. What isn't okay was the way your father handled the situation. I've had similar situations where looking back at some of my father's disciplinary actions were out of line. The lesson was there, and I can admit that there were times when I deserved to be disciplined, but the methods were too extreme for the situation. Based on your description it sounds like your father could have expressed everything that was rude about the interaction, strongly and sternly, but without pushing you to tears or banging on your knee.

> Forcing my friends to play with me when they didn’t want to. 

This is a boundary issue. We all have boundaries and limits we can set for ourselves. This includes you. You have boundaries that you can define and communicate to others. Whether or not this was a residual effect of bad parenting or not does not change that forcing others to play with you when they didn't want to was stepping over a line. You also seem to realize based on your wording (""forced"") that you now know this, and may have taken some responsibility for what you did. If you do, realize that and don't shame yourself for doing it. Realize that you cannot change what you did, but you can do something to control how you can avoid doing that to others in the future if you aren't already on that path.

I'm glad that you took steps to seek diagnosis. It's a good first step to recovering. I have recently been diagnosed with similar disorders, and I can tell you that finding the right therapist, psychiatrist, and deciding to put myself in a intensive outpatient program for group therapy and symptom management is helping more than I thought it would. I feel as if I am fortunate to some degree to find good support in the things I've listed, but know that you can control this, it just takes time and practice using proven methods."

AskReddit,fo20nii,t3_g53q03,1587446239.0,"Alcoholism, mostly.

Got two DUI's, the first which negatively affected his ability to help me find a place for both of us to live since he couldn't drive. The second he was reported to the police for a hit and run that he doesn't remember (since he was drunk after a binge at a bar near his work place).

He blamed the first on the deer that he swerved and missed, putting him in a ditch, and the person who drove by who reported the crash to the police. The second he blames on the person that reported the hit and run, which he admitted he wasn't sure that he did or not, and the police officer that appeared to be arresting him as a means of training what appeared to be a rookie that was with him.

So now we've established that he doesn't take responsibility for his actions.

He multiple times admitted that he drank to escape, but when ""alcoholism"" got brought up, he would defend himself by stating that the volume that he consumed doesn't categorize him as an alcoholic. He would also defend anyone else, even friends that I knew that he didn't that also had issues with alcohol, so he wouldn't be indicting himself.

By the way, his usual volume was 15-16 cans of beer, or he would start with 3 tall boys of Wicked Ale and then get a 24 pack, which he would usually drink about 8 or 9 of after the Wicked Ales. He would consume this 3-4 times a week during the week, and 2-3 times during the weekend. Taking into consideration the times that he admitted to drinking to escape, the volume I just mentioned, and how he would never allow alcohol consumption to be the reason he got into trouble, I'm pretty fucking sure he was an alcoholic.

He once threatened to beat the fuck out of me when I was in bed because that roommate warned him that I was asleep when he was playing SSBU, and that he didn't care if I was sleeping and he would ""take me to the fucking ground"" if I ""came out and started talking shit"".

He would constantly harass me about anything that I didn't do properly. He believed that I had a natural ability to be good at anything, but never understand that nearly anything that I did required a lot of work and dedication.

He would constantly self-loath when he would drink about how he was never as good as he wanted to be at anything, but never put forth any real measurable effort to get better at whatever it was that he was complaining about at the time. He would tell me to ""shut the fuck up"" whenever I tried to give constructive advice on what he could do to better himself.

He would regularly insult my preferences, music, friends, and past times, thinking he was funny. He mostly did this while drunk. He would usually do this after arguing inane things about video games I was playing after he came into my room, and then would pass out and snore in my chair right before I wanted to go to bed. Sometimes he would pass out on my bed. Getting him up after this was a thirty-minute to an hour long task.

I brought this up to him once when he was sober. His response was that he is sorry for what he did and for anything else that he might do in the future while drunk. The second part is the part of that apology that made it bullshit, since that that just told me he wouldn't try to actually modify his behavior.

We have quite a history leading up to the point that I described here, but we somehow managed to make it through rough spots. This was mostly due to the fact that any time that we had a disagreement, I was usually the one conceding and apologizing, while he would just apologize for ""what he is"".

He recently just tried to initiate an interaction, asking if I was making it through the stay-at-home period we're going through right now. I gave him nothing but short responses and didn't try to open up about anything else. I haven't got another message from him and I don't plan on responding to any future messages. If I see him in public I plan to, of course, be civil and respectful. I'm not going to spend anymore time with him, however.

Sorry for the long post, but typing this all out really made me realize how much better I am without him in my life."
