AskReddit,ez66xik,t1_et6fpuv,1567709530.0,Yeah ive thought about it kinda on off for a while now but tonight is the first time I could actually literally see myself doing it and I knew that I really had a chance of doing so. Like doing stuff in a dream and when u wake up and remember then be like yeah 90% I woulda done that irl. Scared me real bad. Maybe the only reason I’m still here is that the thought was about doing it tmr since parents are home rn so I couldn’t actually do it.
AskReddit,ez63y2r,t1_et5z7np,1567708847.0,Exactly same here

depression,ez5wh0a,t3_czzjku,1567706098.0,"Feel the same rn. First time I really considered it and thought in detail, ran it through my head like some normal feasible plan to carry out and I’m scared. I live high up and feel like if I ever thought about it slowly I wouldn’t off myself, so I thought about just waking up tomorrow and before I can think just take a running start then jump straight off the balcony, before I can feel guilt for what I’m about to put my parents through. Idk anymore these thoughts are terrifying but comforting and strangely peaceful at the same time"

depression,ez5sob4,t3_d02xpi,1567704386.0,"This is why I wouldn’t want to be in a relationship though probably no one would ever want me. I think that if I had a gf one day she’d realise how much of a useless fuck and waste of time I actually am, when I get too mentally exhausted to keep up the good cheer and happy mask I have on for social interactions. 

That if she ever gets to know the real me then we’d be done cause I’m just boring, unmotivated and generally just nothing. Even if I manage to act happy and all after some time I’d feel guilty about leading them on and pretending to be a great guy when in reality I’m just a useless depressed fuck. 

Then I’d just have to end things with them since they deserve much better, an actual genuine guy who isn’t me, instead of wasting their time. That if I truly cared for them I’d leave because my prescence is just an unknown burden to them since there’s no future possible at all and I’m wasting their time. 

Bit of a rant probably, hope it helped. You’re probably going to be better off without him, harsh as it sounds. He just wants the best for you, which isn’t him and he knows it. Better late then never. Wish you luck"
