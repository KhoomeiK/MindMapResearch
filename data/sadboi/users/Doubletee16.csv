abusiverelationships,fqoibdz,t1_fqoi0c5,1589515882.0,"So many of us grow up having no idea what healthy relationships look like, ignoring red flags etc... not sure why this has struck a cord with you and the others. Let's not sh*t on the post b/c each flag doesn't line up with your beliefs. 
Good Night."

domesticviolence,fm5oexz,t1_fm5nm8m,1585776798.0,"As crazy as things are/feel, nothing is crazier than living with an abusive, lunatic, man-baby. And I know I'll be okay as I could have died Halloween 2016 in my living room at the hands of my ex husband; I survived for a reason. So I will continue washing my hands and keeping peace at the top of my list. 
So excited to hear your story of healing and peace once you break-free 💜💜

How are you feeling today?"

Celebrate yourself, take care of yourself, love yourself."
alone,fdfned7,t1_fde8ugl,1578365716.0,"Thank you for the explanation. 

I too have blamed myself for broken friendships and romantic entanglements, and while I am onboard for self-reflection as I believe it's a major tool for growth-it sounds like you are being really hard on yourself and seeing things through an blurred perspective.

In the example with the dealer of drugs, he assaulted you because HE's abusive. Your forgiveness of his acts could stem from a message you received long ago that love equals pain. 

Through therapy I discovered when and why my behaviors originated and it's truly freeing. 

I hope through the many resources available you're able to update the way you see yourself, learn to be patient and more loving toward yourself. I believe then you will be able to recognize unavailable, abusive, selfish individuals and run in the opposite direction.
Be Well💛"
alone,fdcvwcl,t1_fdcl69x,1578285834.0,Hi. I hope you don't mind me asking how you concluded that it's always your fault?
domesticviolence,fcsxx7k,t3_eioosr,1577927891.0,"Hi. I don't think relationships should make us want to die. This is a sign that you want out. Have you contacted your local DV center? There are tons of resources and people to help.
Blessings."
domesticviolence,fcp4ei8,t1_fcnu7ht,1577850119.0,"Happy you left and took your month old. Please muster the strength and courage for you and your baby and leave. Threatening you and beating your dog?!! Why??!! What could justify that? And ask yourself what's next b/c statistically speaking things will escalate. These abusers are disturbed and NOTHING will ever please them.
Please contact your local DV center, they can help. 
Peace and safety are priceless 🙏🏾🌻"

Your Mother clearly needs help but you are not to be damaged because she hasn't addressed her issues.

Is there another adult you trust that you can confide in? 

Please do all you can to get away from her. Are you planning to attend university? If so, please consider a school far away in order for you to see a mental health professional, work on your spirituality and heal.

💙💜💛"

domesticviolence,f1467ds,t3_d3lawd,1569170048.0,"Thank you for sharing yout story, I am so sorry you've experienced such trauma and blame yourself...I did too. It's apart of the sickness.
Please contact a DV center, join a support group, and check out Lundy Bancroft's ""Why Does He Do That"". I did all that I suggested after I was assaulted by my ex husband, I wish I knew these things while I was in the midst of the nightmare. 
This is not your fault. You need support and guidance because THIS IS NOT LOVE, IT IS ABUSE. 
Those memories are apart of the past and sadly if you stay with him there may be no future. 
Please focus on healing, and loving yourself. It's up to you to save your life.
Sending you positive vibes 💜"

SuicideWatch,f0kwtb0,t3_ctz0mq,1568690292.0,"It happened for me. Thought he was the love of my life but in reality he's an alcoholic, narcissist, abusive controlling d*ck with mommy issues. He attacked me 10/31/2016, no provocation just his sick mind. Punched me repeatedly in my head, hit me so hard that he released the gel in my retina. Almost 3 years later and I still see floaters. Reason #222 that I want to check out. This place is full of pain and no matter what I do, it just keeps coming. Getting harder and harder to muster the strength to keep going."
