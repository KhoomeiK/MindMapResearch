Fitness,fpctsxi,t1_fpcstz7,1588512491.0,"Okay, much obliged!

If I may direct my initial thought to you. I've seen Jim suggesting on several T-Nation threads to use 5s for lower days and to increase upper supp days if you want. I can hold perfect form on upper days, that's not an issue for me. What are the downsides if I use BBB for upper, and FSL for lower supplemental work? Or if I switch BBB from 5x10 to 6x8? Once again, thanks for all the info, I appreciate it.

Quote from Jim:

>Just do the basic program and add in the FSL work. For the squats and pulls - nothing over 5 reps (FSL). For upper body, you can do some higher reps (5-8)."

I thought there's a difference between a beginner and a novice. I'm a novice for sure, pushing towards intermediate numbers. For the past couple of years I've been very consistent with my training, but I do train for quite some time now. I even took several less heavy months to correct my form and technique, not caring about numbers at that point. I see training as a life time thing, even if I'm pushing 40s at this very moment.

I guess I'm still a beginner. Okay, that's not a problem for me. What do you think when one should introduce BBB in the program?

By the way, I don't have any issues with upper days. I could even bump bench and press to 70% BBB, but I think 60% is a perfect sweet spot for me. I could even use 70% for lower days if I do let's say 6x8."

**Squat** \- I can't brace myself properly when I take a big breath for the last two reps. Hard to keep the bar fixed and tight on my back (low bar squat) which results in bar movement on my back, my elbows drop down hard, arms just get so weak.

**Deadlift** \- Same, hard to brace after I take a big breath, my lats are just saying no more, which means I round my back, hard to keep lower back in a neutral position, grip gets so weak and it's not even that heavy.

I'm aware of the pixel density and different resolutions since I do lots of testing, which I hate by the way :D I think it's the size I'm the most concerned about.

Usually even FHD looks great on laptops, especially 13"" ones. Maybe I'm wrong here, maybe it benefits smaller screens. Ah, I guess I'll have to test it myself to see if it holds.

When it comes to panic attacks, first thing you should know that panic attacks are not dangerous, you're not going to die nor get crazy from them. Second thing is you must educate yourself about it, understand it and work on yourself constantly until it becomes second nature to you.

I guess I said it because new generations are very ""soft"" nowadays, and world is not a good place, people tend to be awful and bad towards each other. Sooner new generations realize that, it is going to be better for them. Great skill to have when it comes to dealing with those type of people. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with being soft, especially with certain close people such as family and friends. I am soft sometimes, as well.

This subreddit is let's say 80-85% based on ""Does anyone else ... "" or ""Do you ... "" questions. I read them regularly and there's no point in them, yes, maybe you're going to feel good for a second, but most of the time you'll make it even worse. This is simply how our disorder works, you are postponing inevitable. It doesn't matter if anyone else has similar or the same symptoms, especially if we take into consideration that we are all different, and we all have different external things that affects us, we can also include personalities here culture etc... So yes, it is irrelevant. What does matter is to understand our disorder and to channel those negative things on recovery, focus your energy on that, work on yourself constantly.

>rather makes them either in the right or the wrong. 

See, this for me also falls into that soft category. There's nothing wrong with being wrong or right. It's wrong if you rub it all over someone's face, being a smartass, an asshole. I'm wrong constantly, also I am very ignorant in some fields that I'm not interested in. There's nothing wrong with that. You can't be knowledgeable at everything, therefore, at some point we are all wrong and ignorant. It's a bonus if you learn from your mistakes, that's a big plus.

>it's about being able to accept that someone is struggling and doing the best they can in that moment while understanding that they can improve. 

Oh, I'm very aware of that, and it pains me so much to see it. How our brain works is that we're going to find so many excuses instead of doing something about it. You can see it everywhere, for example, obesity is a choice in let's say 95% of cases. 5% is if you have thyroid or some other issues. Unfortunately, it's the same thing with our disorder and everything else. It is black and white, but people rather make it gray. From simple to complex in no time, I've done it myself."

I'm here only to help, and please don't drag me into new pc culture thingy, I don't care about it.

It pains me so much when people stubbornly don't want to accept anything, and the solution is in front of them."
PanicAttack,fgonn3f,t3_eznhjt,1580977501.0,"Hey, since all of your tests are normal, you should be very very grateful that you don't suffer from a serious illness. I am very happy for you! At this point it seems that you don't understand our disorder completely, which is perfectly normal.

Since you have already experienced panic attacks in the past, ask yourself a question: What's the worst thing that could happen during or after you experience a panic attack? Really nothing, not much. I understand it's unpleasant, but you were pretty much fine after each panic attack you've experienced.

When it comes to panic attacks, first thing you should know that panic attacks are not dangerous, you're not going to die nor get crazy from them. Second thing is you must educate yourself about it, understand it and work on yourself constantly until it becomes second nature to you. You can live a happy life if you're willing to work on yourself. It is just a nervous arousal, out of order bodily sensations, a manifestation of energy in your body. In essence, you have to learn to get comfortable in your anxious discomfort.

Unfortunately, it pains me so much to see people with our disorder going that rabbit whole, been there myself. At some point I didn't go outside of my house for two years, developed all kinds of phobias and fears, been through war, seen a lot of shit and now I'm slightly over mid 30s and I live a happy and healthy life.

Unfortunately, you're doing the very common thing we panicky and anxious people tend to do, which is finding ridiculous reasons to justify your condition. It is a wrong direction to take. Usually anxious people are very smart, but stubborn. If you're willing to work on yourself you can live a panic free life and you wouldn't worry about nonsensical statistics like ones you have in your mind. This is not me being rude or offensive, it's facts.

By the way, if you know anything about how statistics are done, it is impossible to create such statistics with our disorder. I'll encourage you to go with those numbers to multiple psychiatrists and they are going to tell you that's BS.

If you must believe it, go ahead, but I'm afraid my friend you are going in wrong direction with that, it's irrelevant and yes, panic attacks are not dangerous."
PanicAttack,fgibs6a,t1_fgiasih,1580815834.0,"That is really really rare, even if you have heart issues. You're doing exactly what we panicky and anxious people often do, you are finding and holding to every single small detail you can to keep your panic disorder present and alive, reverse cognitive behavioral therapy. People with serious illnesses, such as: high blood pressure, blood clot, diabetes, obesity, heart disease etc... they live a happy and usually long life, of course with some life-style changes. If you are a healthy individual, stop worrying about nonsensical things. I am dealing with panic attacks and anxiety for over 20 years now, I do regular checkups and my hear is strong as f$%#."
PanicAttack,fgi5c3s,t1_fgi4lqn,1580806304.0,"No worries. Take your time, you don't have to rush. The important thing here is to learn and educate yourself about it.

My response to another reddit user

>I mean, I don't have a budget. Whatever it costs as long as it suits my needs I've mentioned above. I don't want to overpay for something with too many features I won't use. Primary focus is on taking pictures while traveling, and perhaps recording videos here and there.

You wrote to me

> Ok. Sure.

Listen, if you must justify to yourself that I'm the reason for you being a prick, well go ahead, I can't do much about it. Just keep in mind there's a high chance for roles to be reversed, especially in areas where you are not well versed in knowledge.

Mindfulness meditation is great for anxious mind and racing thoughts, even for reducing stress. It takes time to master, but practice makes perfect like in everything else, including panic disorder. Practice, practice and practice. It gets better, trust me, been there myself.

Seek professional help, there's nothing to be ashamed of, it's your life and you're important here, no one else."

I like it, too. Not sure if it is too much for my needs. From what I can see on the net, there's little to no difference between the TZ200 and TZ100, or even TZ95."

I'm pretty much good with technology, tend to learn fast, but since I've never used one, you're right, it is going to be somewhat intimidating at first. But I'm always up for new challenges, I will not shy away from experimenting.

With that being said, yes, the size matters the most for me. Since I'm not using smartphones, most of the time I'm going to keep it in my pocket or perhaps around the neck, and most likely in a bag while in transport. As I already mentioned, I'm not asking for top-notch quality, but decent enough camera to take good photos and maybe shoot some decent videos. I'm not using social medias either, so it is only for me and my family. Oh and I draw/sketch so for taking reference photos, as well.

I already mentioned in other comments, a friend of mine has Panasonic Lumix TZ200 and he swears by it. Looks good, great size, but not sure if it is too much for my needs. I watched some YT videos and it seems perfect. However, this is where my ignorance comes to fruition, I've seen comments where people said there's little to no difference between the TZ200 and TZ100, or even TZ95. I don't know, maybe they are all too much for my needs.

\*\*\*

Oh, I don't think it is a beef, we don't know each other. Never understood how people can hate someone in real life, let alone on the interwebs, it beats me. I'm not a youngster anymore, so maybe that's why. I don't hate you, nor I have anything against you. On the contrary, I think you're very smart, but not sure where to put your first comment yet.

My comment was pure sarcasm to your patronizing comment. Please compare your first comment to your last two comments. I'm really sorry it's not my intention to be rude here, but we all can see where it came from and your intention behind it. Especially because you confirmed that I'm correct about you being a smartass. Okay, let's put it to bed. Honestly, if we ignore first comments, I'm quite enjoying our discussion so far."
PanicAttack,fg3ggbv,t3_ewmgrq,1580480902.0,"Hey friend, I'm really sorry you had to go through your first panic attacks. Good news is, you're not alone and there's plenty of things you can do to overcome and get rid of them for good. At this point it seems that you don't understand our disorder completely, which is perfectly normal since you just had your first panic attack.

When it comes to panic attacks, first thing you should know that panic attacks are not dangerous, you're not going to die nor get crazy from them. Second thing is you must educate yourself about it, understand it and work on yourself constantly until it becomes second nature to you. You can live a happy life if you're willing to work on yourself. It is just a nervous arousal, out of order bodily sensations, a manifestation of energy in your body. In essence, you have to learn to get comfortable in your anxious discomfort.

Cameras,fg3f8bu,t1_fg3d44k,1580480002.0,"Well my friend, I like how you've phrased this comment, thank you. However, you still pride on being a smartass which is a bad trait, at least in my books. So, this is a perfect example of me being ignorant in this (your) field and you are obviously over competent, knowledgeable with lots of experience.

Now, I teach in few fields myself, and I would never approach an ignorant beginner person like you have approached me. For instance, if you come to my ""realm"", the roles would be reversed. Which is perfectly normal and I would never ever act like a smartass towards you. We can't be all smart and knowledgeable at everything, therefore I've used this forum to ask for suggestions.

To be quite honest, you seem really smart, but it's mind boggling to me why you have to be a prick? You're not born with your knowledge about cameras, at some point you were ignorant, as well. Don't you think it would be better if you've skipped commenting especially if you are frustrated with my ignorant post? Problem solved!

Regarding my budget, this is going to sound (it's not) like I'm bragging, but in theory I can buy all three cameras you've shared. So therefore it was very hard for me to put pricing on it. It could be $100, $500, $700, $1000, $1500 ... I really don't know, especially for my needs. Nevere owned a camera, never used one to be precise."

Thread from [u/shitty\_owl\_lamp](https://www.reddit.com/u/shitty_owl_lamp/) is pure gold, I am sharing it with permission constantly. Also these videos [self-help for panic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb5NeGu8DZ_dsW8tx3yOvxEA7mQXpZnrE) goes together with his post. Very well explained and straight to the point.

It sounds very counter-intuitive to people who don't understand our disorder completely to just accept it and allow it to manifest. At the end, it is just a nervous arousal, out of order bodily sensations, a manifestation of energy in your body. In essence, you have to learn to get comfortable in your anxious discomfort. Panic attacks are not dangerous and you're not going to die nor get crazy. 

**Simple tips for exposure therapy**

* Get rid of all safety behaviors
* Seek anxiety, expose yourself to anxiety
* Get the most out of each exposure trip
* More anxiety -> panic attack -> stronger reality check -> therefore less panic attacks

Instead of going down that rabbit whole, you should focus all of your energy on recovery. Educate yourself about it, understand it and work on yourself constantly until it becomes second nature to you. You can live a happy life if you're willing to work on yourself.

I always say, work on yourself, be creative in your process and your journey. At the end we are all different, what works for me perhaps it won't work for you.
