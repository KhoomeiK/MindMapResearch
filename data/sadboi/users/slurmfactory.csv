Id spend up to $200 assuming that i can keep the card when i eventually upgrade the mobo. Yeah coh2 ran great when it first came out and now its just a memory leaking disaster lol, but still my favorite game. Sounds like the upgraded video card will be a nice enhancement and when i finally upgrade the mobo/ cpu/ ram is when ill really get an upgrade. 

Just want to make sure i am investing wisely since my budget is garbage lol.

Thank you again! The game runs 100x better but figure id spend a little more to make a bigger and longer term impact."

That being said, I am looking at jobs and feel unqualified for all of them which is insane. Cysec is a tough freaking field. 

I could have saved $40k by getting a security+ and network+ and made more money than i do now. Or comp sci for a bachelors instead of history. But once you learn the material youre in a good place."
buildmeapc,fqi67ds,t1_fq2rnrt,1589390997.0,"Hey man! So I got the card yesterday and tried it out. Its definitely a huge upgrade from my last card!

So CoH2 cant handle max settings with anti aliasing and v sync. FPS was single digits and lagged me out of the action. Runs fairly well with those off though and everything else maxed out. 

Video playback on Adobe Premiere was improved but still very low FPS there. Probably a cpu issue.

In the meantime, question for you - if I spent a little more money on a different graphics card would that be feasible to say, max out CoH2 with good fps? If this was like $130 could I make a big upgrade that I could use with my next mobo/ cpu for $~200?

Figure adobe wont work unless i upgrade though. Still working on the cost vs improvement balance. Thank you!!!"

buildmeapc,fq11zke,t1_fpxac6z,1589040694.0,"Thanks man! This is amazing. I really appreciate it. 

This is perfect. 

So do you think with the new graphics card, it will improve performance for both CoH2 (what about other gaming?) as well as allow me to do some hobby video editing in Adobe Premiere? Right now Premiere works fine except when I try to play back a video it just glitches or shows a black screen for the video only, but the audio/ program itself work fine, figured its just a cpu or GFX card issue.

These are my main two goals, so thinking I could buy the graphics card now and then wait til the 3100 comes out and get that (because its the same mobo right and I wont need to upgrade RAM for now right?) 

Then I've spent $200 and made a pretty strong immediate impact, then can do a real upgrade after I get a house/ pay off student loans etc.

I am about to buy the card you recommended - I could increase budget maybe $150 if there would be a big upgrade or if this is the sweet spot let me know. update: I bought the card. going to get that cpu in a couple pay checks next. 

This is really helpful, thank you!"

Another fun fact is that Japan was working on superweapon technology and chose Raygun technology over nuclear weaponry, so they could melt soldiers from 100 yards away (IIRC) but it was unreliable and had to be highly focused, so it was a failure.

Had they (or the Germans) chosen nuclear weaponry the ending could have been completely different. There's also the fact that Hitler was asleep for most of the early part of the D-Day invasion and no one dared wake him."
