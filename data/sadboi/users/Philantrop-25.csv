2cb,fr128mf,t3_gm29nq,1589811829.0,I would recommend splitting the .25 in 10 equally big looking parts and then go from there and snort half of one or whatever much you want. You can just take bumps and wait 10 min after each one but thats a rough process i wouldn't like to endure ;)

LSD,fqrl1zf,t3_gkk4u4,1589586517.0,The title says it all no? Some people just should not take acid. Maybe there were underlying issues that he did not want or couldn't face or he is predisposed to some sort of psychosis or schizophrenia.

Also i would recommend only smoking after the peak, then it will bring back intensity but not shoot you so far into unknown territory, but just my personal experience."

LSD,fptcap2,t3_gffz6g,1588888643.0,"Yes thats obviously true. Read up on dose, set and setting to minimize the risk. I think its established that there are people predisposed to schizophrenia or other mental disorders and an intense acid trip can lead to the schizophrenia setting in earlier. I would rate that as the biggest risk, maybe find out if that might run in your family, if you can.
Just make sure you have a safe environment where you can relax and are comfortable and have a good mindset. Also if there are other people you must be able to trust them 100 per cent."
