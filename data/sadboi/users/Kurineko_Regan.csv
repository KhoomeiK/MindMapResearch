This may happen over a span of several days each day going further, also I'm so jelous of you that her parents let you stay over haha, my girlfriend's mom never did even when we weren't sexual the first year, lastly this is all just a suggestion, not a manual you should follow, just maybe keep in mind the feel you wanna go for, mistakes will happen, it will feel awkward and maybe a bit painful, just go with your flow, don't get over excited, it's ok if you can't get it up properly (that's what happened in my first time) took me a few tries to get it in because of this. And your situation calls for even more delicacy and softness and cuddles, still do show a level of confidence and control, perhaps her feeling she doesn't have to control the situation would help her feel more relaxed, in any case have fun and stay safe"

Did I say something? The sex part? Oral sex? Oh ok"" (try not to sound sarcastic lol, the more casual you talk about it the better, my reasoning is that it's easy to scold someone who is mad, someone who is sad, it's easy to scold someone who talks back and yells, but it's not easy to scold someone that seems innocent, so the more innocent you seem when talking about sex the harder it will be for them to enforce their beliefs on you, furthermore once you've established a semi casual feel to this topic (a few days after trying this technique out) tell them you believe it's important that you learn and discuss things about sex properly, tell them you want to have a healthy physical relationship with whoever is your girlfriend when you're old enough, and if they think you should hold till marriage tell them you don't plan to marry until you're over 30 for academic reasons (even if this isn't true) I wish you the best of luck"
