For example.  Last Sunday I broke the head off a scrubbing brush and it got stuck in the trap of the toilet. The rep called them on the same day and they were at my apartment at 10 am the next day.

bathmate,fpacbe7,t1_fpa8xhp,1588445201.0,"correct. after a year and steady maintenance of twice a week pumping, I have kept the ability of my cock to expand by 10% which I consider quite good  

In other words training expands the spongy areas of your cock to fill with more blood than normal.

This is fine as long as you maintain otherwise you regress to the mean. 

I quit after 8 months and was back to where I started from in terms of blood capacity within a few weeks.

When I started using the bathmate again it only took a few more weeks to regain capacity so there you have it. Your penis doesn't grow; only the capacity to expand does which if you think about is the same thing. Since the average male is more or less always somewhat aroused it may seem your cock is bigger but it isn't.

bathmate,fp6xlfw,t1_fp4f7rj,1588360359.0,"tips. hmmmm

leave the valve close except for pumping.

if you're standing fill a bucket partway with a hot towel on the bottom and rest your filled bathmate in it.

massage your cock with the towel before inserting it into the bathmate and between sessions. this helps relieve the extreme pressure.

cock rings. essential for me. one around the top of my balls to keep them out of the way and one around the base of my cock so I get as hard as possible before entering the bathmate. learning this made a huge difference. use the wide soft silicone ones if you try this.

soap up your genitals so that you can slide into the cylinder with the valve CLOSED so that you can take your time getting centered and push up and in as far as you can fully erect. this extra effort pays off so that when you pump 3 or 4 times with the valve OPEN briefly you reach max pressure assuming you are acclimatized.

Angion method 2.0 helped a lot. I found all other manual exercises to be a waste of time because

I realized the main point of the bathmate and it's just my opinion.

These exercises do not make your cock bigger. Your penis is not a muscle. They expand the spongy tissue/chambers inside so that when engorged can accept more blood therefore you are much bigger when even slightly aroused which for men is most of the time even without stimulation.

I found after a year I had gained the ability to expand by about 10% which is huge especially if you are starting at 7 or so like you are.

Once you reach 10% or so then you can maintain by using the bathmate twice a week. If you stop completely then you will regress to the norm.
The longer you train the longer your cock will retain blood to the point where it appears bigger most of the time.

The hot massages with the towel do help with easing pressure between rounds of 3 by 5 minutes.

oh, I""m 7.6 outside of the cylinder and girth is steady at around 6.8. I'm most happy with the girth as growth there really shows up.

KingstonOntario,fnxvozl,t3_g4flq7,1587347340.0,"I had a friend who had this problem in Toronto. The next-door neighbours in her condo would party hearty and their living room was beside her bedroom. It nearly drove her insane and she had to sleep in her kitchen/dining room.

A friend solved the problem. He was an audio engineer. He recorded the neighbours parties and played them back to them at three in the morning for three nights straight.

Never heard a peep after that.

I mean what could these assholes do? Complain about their noise being played back at them? If it was so loud it could be recorded then it was too f\*cking loud.

I suggest the OP rent the loudest band gear he/she can find and place the speakers right up against the assholes wall. If he comes to her door she can just say ""who me""

failing that... as George Carlin once said in his famous ""religion is bullshit rant, ""hire Joe Pesci and his baseball bat"" to pay this noisy neighbour a visit.

ymmv"

And reading. If you aren't reading non-stop when not involved in music/writing where will the words come from? 

here's a song i started writing years ago. sort of describes your situation. use it as a spark/prompt.


""I was pushing 30 when I met the muse

 but the muse was wearing Bob Dylan's shoes.

 I said c'mon c'mon give me a break

 I ain't gettin younger and it's getting late.

 Give me a song, a hit, a tune

 Something great, something I can use.

 have fun :)

 good luck"

you write three pages on school size paper first thing in the morning about anything.

in ten years I've yet to get to the end of the third page and not have a few words that the muse sends me. never. it might be a phrase, a mood, an insight that can be extrapolated into a verse.

whatever comes up I'll take to my writing desk and strum some chords. that always triggers more and more lyrics. most are crap but every now and then something great comes up.

I can't believe you can look at our world today and not come with tons of ideas unless you're only looking for the moon in June stuff and avoiding real words that are topical.

the more you write the more you'll be given. it's really that simple.

also, check the short easy to read the book by Stephen Pressfield called ""Do the Work.""

that's always what it comes down to. As Pressfield says ""Do it or don't. It's your life.""

KingstonOntario,fnmcfjc,t1_fnm6igz,1587068916.0,"follow the two links I gave you. a little research or direct contact with current builds are easily found.

be careful though; the quality of some of these Earthships is so good you might be sending away for plans before you know it :) Look at the one in Alberta on youtube. beautiful.

I was going to build one in the hills above Brighton Ontario at one point but life interrupted. Also, you would never lose money on an  Earthship. Some people build one then rent it out to pay for a second one so you wind up with two.

I even think there is a firm in Ontario who will dig the foundations as well. After that, it's all on you. I mean the things are built with tires, pop cans, and earth. It's not rocket science and unlike wood, you can take your time with these materials and slowly build it.

life is short. don't waste it.

good luck"
KingstonOntario,fnm53vs,t3_g28d05,1587065248.0,"the other commenter is right. bad idea re yurt despite pretty pictures.

I would recommend you build an Earthship instead. here is a couple in Ontario who built theirs for 70 grand but that was years ago.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ3ZykeQGHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ3ZykeQGHg)

here's another one in Collingwood Ontario. So there is expertise out there if you look for it.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lozq1fiC2\_s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lozq1fiC2_s)

this would also require a huge investment of labour so I hope you have lots of friends to stack the pop cans and tires.

if you go this route I'd love to help out as I've considered it myself.

It was all started by a fella named Reynolds in Arizona I believe and there are tons of videos on youtube from all around the world and of course these Earthships are self-sustaining.

I'd make sure the land I bought was on high ground what with climate change accelorating. Who knows where Lake Ontario will be in twenty years' time.

way better than a stick house and once it's built and paid for you would be off-grid. Considering virus's and climate and God knows what else is coming down the road I may still do this myself.

bathmate,fnj82us,t3_g20enh,1586993751.0,"use a cock ring or two around your tubes about 1 inch away from where the bottom lip of the rubber base touches your stomach/groin.

always put the bathmate on while standing. I put the bathmate in a half-filled bucket on the shower floor filled and ready to go.

I push my balls down and tug them a bit and then pull the bathmate on from the bucket.

soap up your balls and cock so the cock rings can slide and soap is great for massaging your balls which helps them to drop and keeps everything slippery when you pull on the bathmate so you can take your time centering your cock and pushing up and in as far as you can before you start pumping.

you'll get used to it. 

can't think of anything else.

bathmate,fner9xn,t3_g0ja0j,1586894436.0,"Your penis is not a muscle. It does not get bigger. The bathmate trains through pressure which increases the ability of the spongy tissue inside your penis to hold more blood when engorged or aroused. It's like boring out an engine cylinder to handle more fuel.

Men are pretty much always aroused to some extent so our cocks get a lot of practice being engorged especially when we are young. The longer you train with the bathmate the more efficient you will become at being engorged with more blood and for longer."
