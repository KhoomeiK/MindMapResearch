But if this dude acted morally acceptable he would still be left broke because divorce is what makes men broke from what i heard. So ""dont marry"" is the only new helpful information i can get from the post. Either that or ""dont divorce"". But when u stop loving someone u either divorce or stay in a marriage u dont like. So in order to not have to decide that, just dont marry. What do you take from the post tho?"

What else would be the plan? Enemy jungler has so much impact and if u fuck him u help all of your team"
RenektonMains,ffggtjc,t1_ffgcaqd,1579905912.0,Tiamat is a MUST-have bro. Your game plan is to shove your wave and steal enemies jungle. And tiamat is required for that. But if im playing vs heavy tanks like singed or maplh etc. Im going botrk instead of tiamat

AskReddit,ff6dvdz,t3_erwt8a,1579625057.0,"I kinda fucked my short term memory to the point that my boss tells me i got concentration problems. Im a dude with social anxiety and lsd fucks you in the brain but it was a fun experience, just dont do it more than once or twice and its okay. Speed and cocaine are fun cuz it helps with your inhibitions and it makes for a fun time with good conversations. You dont have to stop those, just let it be after 2 lines or so. You can't have sex tho cuz of chemo dick. Weed. My best friend is in a depression mostly cuz of weed so i wouldnt recommend that, just smoke it over the curse of 1 and 1/2 months and then stop forever is my idea of enjoying all facetts of life without being stupid. Then there are legal highs, dont use any of them. Then there are drugs like pentadron or hexadron or liquid xtc or this and that (i did like 17 different drugs). At the end theyre all just extremely potent mixtures of the above drugs. I dont regret taking drugs because i always wanted to see life in its fullest form and drugs are like new emotions (for example xtc makes you so happy its like a new emotion) so its a thing I had to do ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Heroin and that harder stuff propably is like xtc and stuff but its so good you dont ever wanna stop so im too scared (or too responsible) for not trying that out ^^"

AskReddit,ff69aoz,t1_ff66wcv,1579622143.0,"If u think about it, depression isnt just a bad mood. You have plenty of reasons to be in a bad mood, aswell! For example being shy and not being able to hit on girls, or smoking pot and always realizing that going home and hit the bong until u sleep is all u have and u cant stop cuz ure addicted (btw u CAN be physically addicted to weed), youre talking bullshit and noone laughs about your jokes, you look bad and everytime you are surrounded by people youre nervous aF and its hell, you eat as much as you can but youre still thin as a grass, you have no interests in life, what job should you practice, when you actually hate every single job, and the only subjects you like are history and biology and those subjects have pretty bad chances in life? The ""plan"" you have in mind, is becoming a boring ass official... You have no hobbys, the hobbys you had? You stopped practicing them. Youre lazy and you know it, you dont finish anything you start, you got a drinking problem aswell, you never had a ONS and the relationships you had didnt last. And whenever you tell someone, youre embarrassed because you dont have the right to be depressed about your life, your dad killed himself after being a mentally and a bit physically abusive father for 15 years, youre scared you will be a father like this, too, your big brother got some decent anger issues. And and and.
Depression isnt just an illness. Its... A way of seeing things. Depression doesnt lie to you, it shows you the truth. And noone knows what to actually do about it. Im bipolar btw so i got phases where i do things that would better my situation (i learned a few songs on the piano, im currently registered at a fitness center) but i will never know how and WHEN my mind switches. I just realize i want to do things at random.

Yeah sorry man you asked for it

AskReddit,ff67njs,t3_ervyyq,1579621070.0,"There was a song i used to listen to after my first gf and me broke up, it was ""do i wanna know"" by a popular band im too lazy to google now, when we chilled together again she put the song on and ofc i had to be stupid and think she wanna mess around with me cuz thats why i listened to this song the whole time, too. So i asked her if she wanted to smash (after like 2 months of hanging out finally i had the courage to ask her). Well she wasnt laughing at me but she laughed it off and said im crazy (not in a bad way, she propably woulda smashed BUT->) turns out she got together with her best friend she knew for 5 years or so and they just didn't tell me (hes a friend of mine, too). I never stopped loving her, ofc im not IN LOVE with her, but, y'know, i take the view that true love doesnt vanish ever. Or maybe im just dumb or whatever. Well anyways, thats the reason i dont listen to the song anymore because i dont want to be stuck thinking about my exes anymore

RenektonMains,fednlom,t3_eocv9d,1579015868.0,"Renekton is easy to learn, hard to master, exactly the champ you want to one trick. I started at plat 4 in september and had a 58% winrate with him up until plat 1. I then dropped, tilted, and got banned, but all in all he is a nice champ. People tend to think rene is OP or even strong when in reality he is like B tier top laner or something, so i recommend to mute all ^^
You can win against darius, you totally stomp yasuo, you can win vs riven, fiora is skill matchup, ornn is hard but doable, aatrox is winnable, jax and garen are winnable, if youre good enough you can pretty much snowball vs any melee champ (almost). He looks cool, he says cool stuff, i love renekton. Nice dmg, nice sustain, tanky with ult, nice mobility with E. I dont see why anyone would onetrick someone else tbh ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

RenektonMains,fe5anmo,t3_enjsrh,1578867091.0,"well youll find that spear of shojin got yeeted (i started maining renekton just then)

u could go mid but lets be real top lane is the island we love and hate

ofc rush tiamat, if youre already ahead and fed: you can go ghostblade, then black cleaver

proxxi a bit, take enemy junglers farm, and draw his attention so your team can concentrate on drake and lanes

if u got tp dont forget to use it to help your other lanes, dont just not use it at all, then at least tp for farm and a free back

rene is still viable, all the bad matchups stay bad and wont change after shojins, meaning nasus will eventually surpass you and you cant change that, you can still so some fancy 1v2 fights but all in all you dont want to force a 1v2 

oh and combo him under tower and E out, you already know

darius is a winnable matchup but hes definetly strong, dont ever get hit by his Q!

ornn is my most hated matchup, hes tanky and does tons of dmg

quinn cant E to her tower if youre between her and her tower while autoattacking, keep that in mind

ryze is the champ i always ban

kennen is annoying and without your jungle you shouldnt be able to kill him in lane i think (maybe im playing it the wrong way tho)

gnar is the champ im most afraid of after ryze, but i dont see many gnars

singed is actually not that bad but you gotta get out fast after combo him cuz he wins trades (idk how tho)

fiioa is strong, just wait for her to W, be patient

urgot is disgusting you cant fight him

aatrox is okay if you win trades but you also cant fight him when youre even

morde is actually harder than i would expect (for me) but its doable, dont get poked by his Q

yeah i know you were only away for 3 months, not for 12 years but i kinda wanted to test my knowledge

aight c ya gl hf"
