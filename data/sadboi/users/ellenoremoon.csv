It makes the world seem less “on fire” when you know you only need to make it through this moment. Focus on the now instead of the what ifs or the future. I am so happy to know your are ok. Might seem weird from a stranger but I want you to know people are here for you."

Delaware,fp85g9r,t3_gbonza,1588384002.0,"So, I know personally that I have been affected by intense anxiety and depression from the state of the world right now. From the death toll to the fact that life, as we know it, has drastically changed. But, what’s the biggest reason people want the state to reopen? Stores will surely have the same amount of products they had during the quarantine, we’ll still need to sanitize everything, and a lot of us will have reduced hours at work (if they are not already reduced, like mine have been...almost to zero). What is THE reason to protest safety? Cuz anyone who has the virus and isn’t wearing a mask is literally a biochemical bomb waiting to explode and I’m fuckin flabbergasted."

I didn’t give her any negative or positive feedback and she was ready to cry. Afterwards she called me a hoe and is convinced that this episode was a huge red herring. I found the entire episode to be hilarious. Especially as someone who is a curmudgeon who talks trash to kids on xbox live for fun. Fuck Mo lol"

mentalhealth,flszusl,t3_fqxs52,1585455158.0,"I appreciate you sharing this. I had a similar problem. Trichotillomania is what I suffered from for many years. Hair pulling was a very serious problem to the point where I had to cut my hair down from about a 12 inches to about half an inch. Keeping my hair short except on the top is the only way I’ve really found to not give myself any triggers. But stress is a very big motivator in pulling my hair out. In fact, I actually found that while stress is a very big part of my life, having control over certain things is fundamental to my mental health. Realizing that I don’t look half-bad with a Brendon Urie haircut was a nice little boost too. Anything to keep my neuroses down to a tolerable level. I really wish you the best of luck with this. *hugs*"

bipolarart,flnntm1,t3_fpsj2j,1585322435.0,I love this. Especially being a person of color. Especially because I have always hated that monkey statue for “hear/see/say no evil”. Anybody with that statue is always a lil bit off. This is amazing and I would buy this and hang this on my wall.
serialkillers,flnf9ps,t3_fpv7bh,1585317298.0,"The only evidence I have is the movie, The Iceman. Great flick IMO. Michael Shannon played “Richie” quite well, but actually less creepy than the actual man (which is saying a lot because Michael Shannon definitely has creeper vibes on the norm.) But Ray Liotta played Roy Demeo from the Gambino crime family. If you have Ray Liotta in your movie, it’s a mob movie. I’m sorry, but it’s been that way since the 80s, it’s still that way now. Anyway, I did absolutely no research for the actual proposed question but I want you to ponder this: If Kuklinski didn’t have ties to the mob, don’t you think there would be some kind of uproar? Specifically because this man was almost a glorified delivery guy for murder. Who wants to hear about Richie K from Jersey who wanted a slice of the pie right? All it takes is somebody to write a book or two and Richie gets a bit over-the-top with flourishing details and a name here and a name there to make it more colorful and suddenly he’s in this mob and that family. It’s so much fun to realize how much he honestly could have lied. But I feel like somebody would have retaliated if they were “offended”. With how people talk about how connected everything is, it would have been easy. He was sick for the last years of his life. He never saw his family, he was alone. Just him and his thoughts and tons of people in prison who were sick of this man’s stories. 

TL;DR: probably."
