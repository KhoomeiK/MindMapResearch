GalaxyS9,fp1dw86,t3_gai823,1588232277.0,"As little as the advancements are in newer flagships, I wouldn't say no to HDR+ capabilities of any newer flagship, as well as greater definition again in camera department. One thing that really keeps me sided with Samsung is its display. I recently broke my display and had to have it fixed, turns out the box comes with full equipment. The display, the screen, the back glass as well as the battery. So two years into s9+ and my device now is as good as new."

depression,eupzuus,t3_cgujfp,1563967755.0,"I understand and share your issue. I've come to think that we by nature want our environment to act accordingly. Just by being able to control little things we want control over more and bigger which builds expectations. But then our environment and especially people never act the way we need and want. Eventually it is us who are disappointed. I think I talk too much, almost as much as my stream of consciousness. It just maybe a way of venting that I can't control. Friends don't say it but I can understand by the distances that go much further between me and my friends every day. Then I begin to think why the hell they even want me for the emotional fuck up I am. Things just moving at the speed of light and I can only watch tied to a chair."
depression,eupwx7e,t3_ch6k8i,1563966091.0,"I have also documented on paper each day throughout depression after my wife left me . Personally, as good as it feels to write especially dark and poetic, what I realise is that I had been holding onto the possibility of having her back while writing. Concisely, I thought I was not only trying to assess my mind's way of thinking and my behaviour but also unintentionally considering her as an audience which made it eventually not as real as I thought it would be. Eased me out first then made it worse later."
