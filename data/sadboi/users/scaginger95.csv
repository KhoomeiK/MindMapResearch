Yeah ideally we’d be in public schools but I guess we have to wait and see, I’m wondering are less people applying this year because of the virus, might make it easier to be placed near each other?"
teachinginkorea,fq7owew,t1_fptja8m,1589149312.0,"Thanks for letting me know, I was wondering about that, again because it’s still cheaper than actually paying rent, it’s not a huge deal but it’s good to know.

We’re not even sure if we’ll permanently live together while we’re there, but would like to be very close by at least so it’s unlikely either of us would get into a subletting issue, I can imagine it’s not an easy thing to do there! Great advice thanks!"

We were rejected by Korvia, I’m not sure why but maybe it was because we were a couple 🤷🏽‍♀️"
BPDlovedones,f8cd7sl,t3_e036ii,1574457786.0,"Take some time to relax and enjoy yourself properly! 

Learn to set boundaries- with everyone you encounter, from passing strangers to work colleagues to friendships and family. Whether that means taking time for yourself, telling someone you’re not comfortable with something or just learning not to feel guilty for reaching your limits.

Make new friends who open you up to new ideas. Travel somewhere if you can, read books, take up new hobbies.

It’s all about re building your strength, enjoying freedom and enjoying yourself! 

Take things slowly and accept that you can’t please everyone.


I’ve been trying to do all of the above and I’ve made some amazing friends along the way and we’ve helped each other so much. 

I’ve found stable love too and it feels great!

Be grateful for your current life and the people you already love and you’ll have the strength to avoid ‘red flag people’ :)"
BPDlovedones,f7fl15t,t3_dveokq,1573681686.0,Congratulations! It’s just the best feeling ever when you reach those ‘conflicts’ and it’s resolved responsibly. It honestly fills me with so much joy. It’s funny I’m only realizing now that it’s possible to understand more and more about a person. Rather than just becoming more and more confused!!

BPDlovedones,f19x2cd,t3_d83if4,1569280348.0,"Thanks guys this has been real good to read your responses, whenever I’m trying to deal with my feelings and memories about the relationship I only think about the nasty middle and ending and forget it fog over how I felt at the beginning. It’s definitely so important to remember the beginning though because it really highlights negative patterns I can get myself into! Hope you all feel the same about discussing this :)"
NoFap,f1830rl,t1_f1829f3,1569251955.0,"Hahaha was my weird brain back then, maybe I phrased it wrong but when I was feeling more depressed I guess it felt like I was too scared to just be my normal self when I was out... kind of like girls who can’t leave the house without make up, but my hyper sexual self wore tight clothes and showed a lot of skin lol"
NoFap,f17x1kh,t3_d86aym,1569249523.0,"Fellow girl here! I completely get what you’re saying, I used to always dress in a way that I knew would attract sexual attention. I kind of hated that I would never have the balls to dress normal, When I dressed that way I found it kind of fun when I got male attention. But then on days where I felt I was dressing more modestly it wouldn’t change the way men treated me. I would still get looks and comments from both men I found attractive or unattractive.  

It was then I realised I dressed in a sexual way because I at least felt like this attention was under my control. It felt like It happened because I had decided to be sexually attractive. Therefore I felt I had control over my sexuality in general. 

There are many reasons I was looking for that control but in terms of just being out and about as a woman it was definitely a case of trying to feel empowered by others reactions to your sexuality rather than feeling awkward and/or upset. 

As I get older I care less about these reactions from men. I’m much more confident in myself and my reactions are more stable. If I see a guy checking me out more subtly I take it as a small confidence boost, if he’s more aggressive about it I just make a joke in my head about it. Just try not to connect it to your personal sexuality tho. Try and take it he same way you would if a stranger smiled at you or was rude, it doesn’t really reflect your character either way. A strangers sexual reaction to you has nothing to do with your actual sexuality. 

Hope this was somewhat helpful. I hope sticking to NoFap can help you meditate on what you really want for yourself as a sexual being and you’ll be free of a strangers opinion!!"
BPDlovedones,f17tmkd,t1_f17mrv5,1569248189.0,"Yes I feel like I wasn’t in my right mind, I feel like I was in a daze and I’ve come out of it now and it’s so hard to understand. I want to try to understand how I let it happen and why I went along with it. 

Also about the parents, I didn’t meet them until about a year into knowing him but they basically saw me as his new caregiver and would give me money as gifts when I knew they were struggling financially. His mother at one point hugged me goodbye and whispered to ‘take care of him’, that was a big warning to me and I’m glad it didn’t take me too long after that to leave!"
BPDlovedones,f0peezv,t3_d5wv4y,1568832973.0,"Omg this literally could be my ex BWBPD, scary how similar these long angry messages are!"
BPDlovedones,f0pdc9a,t3_d5rbmf,1568832340.0,"Sounds exactly like my ex and I’m still struggling over the idea of whether it was my fault or not.... but I did break up with him, I haven’t seen him in nearly two years and we’ve been NC for nearly a year and I’m so much happier. Even when you doubt if it’s abuse or if it’s your fault know that not being with him is the best answer! So concentrate your energy on getting rid of him, not worrying about why you should."
BPDlovedones,f01x6wb,t3_d3cdk2,1568320101.0,"In all honesty you should move and the sooner the better. I was reading through old messages with my expwBPD (not the happiest thing to do but wanted to remind myself) and he was getting very angry with me over literally nothing then I’d ignore him all day as a boundary and then he’d say sorry that evening  and that we’d both help him through his issues together and then the next day he’d get irrationally angry with me again. This never stopped and even after we lived apart it came up whenever we spoke. I haven’t spoken in 8 months and it’s honestly been a breath of fresh air! It takes time to heal, it’s been two years since I left and I think I’m feeling worse than I ever have about it as reality hits me hard. But I’m looking forward to coming out the other end and I know I will. There’s so much opportunity for you to have a happy relationship and to have kind people in your life. The bottom line is that the good people in your future deserve your help and love more than someone who treats you bad in the present!"
BPDlovedones,ezawwj5,t1_ez7sui3,1567808914.0,"Sorry to hear that. I must ad there are also other issues I’m experiencing and everything seems to be coming to the surface. I’m trying to use meditation as a way of learning to try and detach unpleasant feelings from myself, even if they cause a lot of disturbance in day to day life."
BPDlovedones,ezawetx,t1_ez7qybu,1567808679.0,"Yeah this is probably quite a big issue, when I reflect my recent mental state,  I notice I’m expecting far worse from the people close to me and it just develop a foggy fear over small issues. I suppose I need space to somewhat rationalize what was and wasn’t an acceptable way to be treated! Hopefully I can move forward from that, have you experienced this ‘catching fleas’"
BPDlovedones,ezavyiq,t1_ez9f3jw,1567808457.0,"Yes, I was particularly anxious in the end too, I think also I just have a general tendency towards anxiety so it’s hard to tell what feelings are genuine sometimes and maybe why it’s all still bothering me. As I’m only realizing now what was unacceptable behavior towards me"
BPDlovedones,eyrtpts,t3_cy6bhu,1567378019.0,"I’m still working out how it’s changed me. I’m learning how to set up boundaries all the time. forming new relationships (of all sorts) with nonBPD people has helped me re-verify what’s a normal amount of stress to take from someone else. I’m definitely so much more anxious still about people but I try to just learn from my reactions. 

I’m also very conscious that I don’t ever treat someone the way I was treated. This is a bit tricky as my judgement feels fogged as to what’s acceptable.

In terms of getting out; this was something I wanted for such a long time. I was working away for some a small amount of time and it made me realise the strength I had, it was just hidden. When I eventually did end things it just felt very instinctual and I felt very numb for a while. We talked all night and I discussed how I didn’t want to completely end the relationship cold turkey but we could be friends and see if that works better. We both moved country and a year later he cut off contact with me but by then I was relieved. After a year of only brief contact now and again he was still resentful and said spiteful things but I still spoke to him out of  guilt because he’s so vulnerable. He’s completely cut off contact with me. I’d love to be on some sort of speaking terms with him but I’m accepting that it may not be the case. 

But I’m learning to be happy and to have more normal relationships. Normal relationships can be difficult when you’re used to such volatility but just take things slow and know it’s only work it when it’s fun!"
Anxiety,ex3wruc,t3_cr9490,1565993218.0,They shouldn’t do it to anyone anxiety or not lol
BPDlovedones,ettk5bo,t3_cdbr6g,1563184374.0,"Yes, I’m really scared of this. When I first started seeing my current partner I was pretty recently out of my relationship with pwbpd and I tried to keep things as casual as possible as I was in no state to deal with even normal emotions from him - such as mild jealousy etc. this possibly hurt things later on but I feel if we’re good enough together we can handle it! 

Now a year later and I’ve been going through a lot of stuff (my grandmother passed away, we’re living long distance from each other and I’m living away from my friends and family). I’m finding it hard to tell him how I’m feeling because I’m scared I will turn into a needy person. Definitely at the start I did it the wrong way because it was impossible to avoid the pain I was feeling so instead of explaining it to him in a mature way I’d get angry instead. So I then took example from my mother who is grieving and would sometimes message me to say she wasn’t feeling great and I realised how easy it was to help her when she was just straight with me.

I think a huge thing is to try not to compare your new relationships with any other relationship. And if you’re feeling down just let them know because it’s important to share things with your partner, and see them as a sound board rather than a solution. These are both things that I struggled a lot with from my pwbpd."
BPDlovedones,erlfr94,t3_c2gnd7,1560986003.0,"I’ve found someone I feel so much better with. It’s no where near as intense and I wouldn’t change that for anything. He makes me feel so normal and I love the consistency and slow harmonious development of our relationship. 

I still have a lot to get over because of my ex and unlearning bad thought processes I developed being with him. But I am repulsed by any drama in a relationship. I never want anything as intense again. 

Even if you don’t find someone new for a while, try to focus on slow, gradual happiness wherever you may find it. Because once you find peace like that you’ll never miss the emotional highs and lows of your past relationship(s)."
BPDlovedones,erl7coz,t1_erkwoua,1560980043.0,"Yes this is very similar! 

It’s frustrating because you can accept that maybe your opinions were over the top as a teenager (because everything is over the top as a teenager) but staying friends with someone who doesn’t see this must be incredibly frustrating."
BPDlovedones,erkur85,t1_erktx6l,1560971886.0,"Yeah that helps so much! 

My new boyfriend would show me how ridiculous my fears about him can be and when I told him about things my ex did,  he’d tell me it was crazy. 

It’s funny now but at first I kept apologizing for what I now realise is completely normal behavior. 

I didn’t even realise how I had to completely restrain my sense of humour, because even some of the most innocent jokes were flipped into some sort of proof I was out to hurt my pwbpd. And that I was an abusive person who needed professional help. 

It’s like having a pwBPD sucks you into this world where anything you do or say will be turned into negativity to be turned against you and it becomes impossible to step out of it. 

Taking a break and spending time with people who help you realise how ridiculous your fears have become is the best freedom and the best therapy!!"
BPDlovedones,erks5pi,t3_c2if66,1560970212.0,"At best I was told by my expwbpd ‘why are you bringing this up again, you’re just trying to make me feel bad so you look good’ - this would nearly always be the first time I’d bring something up. 
Or that I was lying about something he did to ‘win the argument’. 
He’d also always say very vague things about how I treat him badly in response and could never back these things up with facts. 

Or he’d cry. They’re all manipulative defense mechanisms that reinforce the idea that there’s always a victim in every relationship and it can only be them. 

All of this caused such internal conflict that I think I just eventually found it easier to accept what he said as true and apologize. As more time passes since I left him I realise how unreal it was."
BPDlovedones,erczfkb,t3_c16h90,1560726346.0,"Your relationship to him almost mirrors the first few months with my BPDex

I notice with any type of milestone, the bad sides of him started to show. 

When we went on holidays together was the first time it he was really horrible to me. 

This was also about 6 months in.

I also want to warn you because when I first notice the red flags I was cautious, just like you’re being. But when it came to the point where he was actually treating me really badly, I found it harder and harder to leave. And took nearly two years to do so afterwards which I deeply regret. 

My advice is to leave now before he has a chance to really hurt you. It’s much easier now than it would be if things went wrong and you became an exhausted,  nervous wreck. 

Would you allow a close friend or relative to risk being treated badly again?"
BPDlovedones,ercxc0f,t3_c1dlyx,1560724601.0,"I avoided breaking up with my ex because of his birthday and it resulted in sulking and fights because I didn’t want to have sex at the exact time he wanted. Even though ‘i said we could do whatever he wanted for his birthday’ 

He pulled me over in his car and basically fought me until I would have car sex with him in a car park in broad daylight. I was so obviously uncomfortable but me having negative feelings about sex whatever the situation meant I was being selfish. 

He Then proceeded to have tantrums the rest of the day because I was ‘walking too fast’ to catch a train and ‘put my friends before him’ (I didn’t want to be late meeting them)

Sorry for a probably not very helpful and long comment but the point was I kept waiting for the right time and it just got worse and worse. Finally 6 months later I managed to do it and only now after two years I feel no fear anymore just repulsion. 

I hope you find an easy way out!"
BPDlovedones,er33z87,t3_bzvss4,1560455428.0,"Just take it down to the simple fact that you feel the need to set ‘boundaries’ with this person. 

In a healthy, happy relationship any boundaries an individual needs should be met naturally and be second nature. Not something you feel the need to enforce or as a means to fix the relationship. 

A relationship that needs strict boundaries is never worth it. 

I promise you’ll find fulfillment much easier without a person like this. The guilt will fade over time and you’ll feel like yourself again soon."
BPDlovedones,eqq01mj,t3_byy9on,1560208576.0,"He sounds exactly like my ex. (Broke up 1 yr 6mnths) It took a few weeks for mine to believe I had actually broken up with him. (But this is after months of fighting getting more frequent and less and less intimacy) I know in theory it’s probably the wrong thing to do but I managed to make it seem like we might get back together one day. But it definitely helped with any drama or manipulation that could have happened initially and I don’t know if I could have done it any other way. And we stayed ‘friends’. 

Also I was lucky in the fact that I was moving country so it was easier to keep a safe distance between us. We spoke every 3 weeks or so. But now we don’t speak at all. When he unfriended me on Facebook 6 months ago I felt such a relief. 

My advice if it continues to be hard is to have a timeline for yourself where you slowly limit contact. And have a ‘reality check’ support. Even if it’s just one person you can talk to, I always struggled with realizing how dysfunctional our relationship was and how badly he actually treated me, it’s good to have a something to reassure you that you’re doing the right thing."
