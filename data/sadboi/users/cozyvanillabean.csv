The first day I played RFA, I barely survived the first 3 levels on difficulty 9. I was sweating like a fountain and my muscles were sore for 4 days afterward (the squats especially killed me). But, to my surprise, I found myself wanting to play more the next day! I wanted to see more of the story, complete sidequests, make smoothies, unlock new Fit Skills... RFA's Adventure Mode gave me the motivation I needed to finally stick to an exercise routine. 

I've been playing for 34 days now, and I can already feel the changes. My stamina, flexibility, and strength are so much better now. I can actually do multiple squats without feeling like I'm going to pass out!!! My mood has been better too, which has been especially valuable during these rough times.
