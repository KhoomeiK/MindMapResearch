Chinese and Korean guy themed movies or shows are just too damn depressing regardless. Everyone ends up dead or straight."

Finally I started looking for a internal medicine doctor instead of a primary care physician. They have been great and give me my meds and do blood draws every 3 months no hassle. I just suggest you keep looking and if any doctor starts not listening to you just find a new one till you get a decent doctor who actually cares.

I don't eat a lot of gluten, maybe 3 times a week in the morning I might have some wheat toast or a sandwich. And everything else is gluten free. But soy, peanuts, and dairy make me feel worse than gluten ever did. As soon as I went low gluten and 100% no soy, dairy or legumes I felt great. Especially the soy, that stuff makes me so sick"

He doesn't mind some shoulder time but hates human hands and bites us all the time even though he does love us. He is just a moody bird compared to my first.

But it really depends on how your partner is about it. Dismissing it due to not understanding it is common and often forgivable if they at least try to sympthasize. My partner doesn't have ptsd but will listen to me and say ""I'm sorry that sounds awful"" even if he doesn't really get why I can't just chill out like he can.  He knows not to say anything rude.

You want to make sure when you start it you aren't dealing with too much stress in your daily life as much. I had to stop the EMDR while I was finishing my last semester of college but went back on it as soon as I could. 

It sounds scary but all it does is take really vivid important memories and reshapes your thinking on them so you don't feel so bad about them  in the future. It is very worth it just to feel the weight come off mentally.

CaregiverSupport,ficj7eq,t3_f7n35d,1582348880.0,"How far gone is her dementia? Either way, in general frustration on any of my patients end is usually due to 3 things: pain, lack of sleep, or not understanding something. With dementia you can get a collection of all 3, especially with an infection. The chances of having a whiny client are high, but it's your job to take it all in and stay calm. 

I have worked with dementia clients are are fairly pleasant in general. But there have been a few who are paranoid ones and do get violent or frustrated easy. Usually if I am dealing with such a case I try to gauge what really needs to get done, like a meal or bath and try to make it my one priority. Usually by distracting them from whatever is frustrating them by asking them questions to jog a memory or two. It can also help to calm someone down by knowing their hobbies and having them do it for awhile while you tend to anything else that might need done in the mean time. 

In the end, the real key to patience is just having done caregiving for a long time and finding a way to hold it all in and release the frustration later. (In my case a few rounds with my boxing bag and a work out). Find a healthy outlet to be able to let it out later. It will make it easier to hold it in and not aim it at your Mom so fast.

Another issue is intimacy. I was sexually assaulted as a child and there are times sex is just uncomfortable for me. My body goes through stages of fear of sex (where I avoid his touch or flinch and cry if we try) to wanting it 3 times that day and it's a lot to deal with. 

The only other issue is my night terrors. He will stay up with me all night while I have them and talk to hallucinations in my sleep. Sometimes I may kick or punch him if he tries to wake me up. 

But I never feel like I'm too much for him. It really is about honest communication.

The first one was when I was still in highschool and took cafe of her every weekend and school break. Her drugs of choice being her antidepressant and anxiety pills. It can be really scary. 

She did her second attempt a few years later, usually during Christmas due to her seasonal depression. She did it while I was cooking and I found her passed out on the toilet with puke all over her. (Sorry for being graphic) This one led her to have some permanent brain damage and she got lots of mini strokes after that. 

Her third one was while me and my bf were bathing the dog and she added too many insulin injections to it as well to drop her blood sugar. She managed to get into a coma and actually died for a little while on the way to the hospital. But we hadn't properly signed her DNR papers and they managed to keep her alive. She ended up going on dialysis after that I did the care for. 

Her last attempt was just before her birthday 4 years ago during my last year of college  and she learned how to load my uncles  shot gun. We went to the movies and she decides not to go last minute. We came home to find her deceased. 

Sorry for the long story but yes I understand you. It is really hard to deal with and all I can say is sometimes a person's physical or mental issues can be so strong that no matter how much you love and support them it just isn't enough. And it's never anyones fault."

Hashimotos,f4ot4x0,t1_f4one4g,1571707778.0,They do know. They refuse to give me a script for 50 mg saying I dont need it.

ptsd,f3ueo2f,t3_di8ali,1571158716.0,"I've started CBD oils for my anxiety and pain (I also have an autoimmune disease) since my anxiety pills were so difficult to get and too expensive for me. It has done wonders for both and I also use a cbd pain balm with the oil to help  with my chronic pain areas. I dont have to use anxiety meds or muscle relaxers anymore which is a blessing. I'm glad too see it helping so many people around me too. 

As someone with a family of addicts, the option of going med free is relieving. I was so scared to go on another anxiety med and have it lose its luster again."
Hashimotos,f10cuuw,t3_d7hg96,1569110666.0,"5.6 tsh is very high. She needs to see a proper endocrinologist who does steady bloodwork checks and gets her meds adjusted to where she needs to be. She also should be having dietary restrictions on the big triggers like dairy, soy, nuts, and gluten. 

Now that being said she works full time and the way it works for hashimotos is our bodies even o  a good days sleep for us is working at 60-70% energy compared to your 100%. Working full time can drain away more than she has, plus her bad diet and common stress making her chronic pain probably worsen she probably feels like butt a lot.  

She really needs to watch her food triggers more seriously and get a better doctor to help lower her levels.  She will feel better in a few months if she sticks with good habits. Just be patient  with her if she's trying hard at that at least, I dont know how her diet is so I couldn't  say. Make sure she isn't working out  too much or dieting like a normal person would either. 

It took me 6 months with only a part time work schedule, a better diet, and stopping going to the gym entirely and switching  to light walking a few days a week to get better internally. And even after I got better I struggle and am tired. She might always be tired and not want to go out. I dont blame her. 

But please if you can talk to her about diet. Paleo or autoimmune diets are important cause what we eat really does make us sick."

cockatiel,ezs7es8,t3_d1wn17,1568084115.0,If he's biting hard enough to be painful or draw blood then you can attempt to stop the behavior through association. Like someone  said earlier if they attempt to bite say no and put them back in the cage as a time out.  But if their just nibbling due to curiosity then I would say its fine and let him do it. Birds are very curious and their beaks are the biggest tool for that. My bird loves my lips when I am eating and is always biting my lips and my moles since they look like a big soft seed to him. It's a natural behavior and not necessarily bad.
cockatiel,ezs706v,t3_d2161j,1568083848.0,A vocal bird is a happy bird. The more noisy they are the happier they seem to be usually. Unless their hissing. And the wings opening is just exercise for them. They need to keep their body stretched and keep moving all the time to wing stretching is pretty common.
Hashimotos,ezs693g,t3_d1smez,1568083491.0,"I am gluten, dairy, soy free and I still get chronic aches after a a long day at work. Sometimes  diet changes don't really work as much, although they helped a little. 
I had to do 2 things. One being stop my heavy workout routine of 3 times a week and start doing lighter workouts like yoga and walking. 

Second being allowing my body to recoup after long days. I now do my house cleaning once a week instead of every day to help with my recovery and when I get home from work I sit down and relax for 3-4 hours after a shower for my muscles to let it build its energy back up before I attempt to rush into doing anything needed like dinner or dishes. 

Weekends off I make sure to relax and sleep in when I need to. I rarely go out anymore cause I find it makes my aches worse. A big part of listening to your bodies limitation is knowing how much is just simply too much. Which for people like us when our daily energy starts half full to begin with we have to use wisely.

 Overworking the body can take days to recover since your already limited on energy.  This can be considerably harder if you have any kids or responsibilities at home like pets. But its important to slow down  and let yourself be a little more ""lazy""."
ptsd,ezs4dpy,t3_d1vhis,1568082635.0,"Now that I am in a good place mentally after years of therapy, I don't feel as exhausted from my ptsd as I used to. I also have hashimotos disease, so it's hard to say what causes worse problems anymore. 

The only big thing I deal with is the paranoia I get since I am med free now and the constant anxiety from the paranoia is what is really physically exhausting on my body all day. It affects my sleep mostly and I barely sleep 4 hours a night due to my anxiety."
cockatiel,ezaflkn,t3_d09vdo,1567800546.0,"That's just a blood feather.  Make sure they don't mess with it and it will heal up. I would just make sure they're not biting at it, keep it clean, and keep an eye on it. It can get infected if they go at it too much"
ptsd,ezac21n,t3_d0go6f,1567798605.0,"Unfortunately with ptsd sex can have it's scary moments and your partner may not have to do anything for you to feel threatened or unsafe. I think in order for a healthy sexual relationship to continue you should always talk about it after an incident like this happens.
 I was sexually abused, but I do like rougher sex so my spouse will cater to my needs even though he isn't into it as much. But there are times even though I asked him to play rough and its 100% consentual I manage to shut down and just try to finish it without saying anything. But that usually leads to paranoia for me an I end up avoiding sex since my brain is somewhere else for awhile. 
But talking about it in a way where you can say you felt uncomfortable with what he did, but it wasn't his fault it was your inability to say stop or use the safe word( if you have one). It releases some of that paranoia."
Hashimotos,eyu8k2g,t3_cyra66,1567455666.0,I've always taken my levothyroxine per usual around 6 AM before any blood test. No doctors ever told me to not take it before any blood draw.  Skipping medicine in the morning makes me too sick anyway
Hashimotos,eymebqt,t1_eyme6mm,1567206667.0,Not anyone I've talked to. I barely managed to reduce mine by half when it was up in the 7's.
ptsd,eylmudt,t3_cxeq67,1567188082.0,I did EMDR for 3 months and it does get a little easier once you start to comb through your memories more. But I had a very distinct numb walking zombie effect for 1-3  days after any session. If you dont feel kinda shitty after it probably didn't work.  It's supposed to bring back messy emotions so you did good for a first session. If you find it's just too much then its ok you can always do it later. Sometimes you just aren't prepared for how much comes out when you do the sessions. I would try it 3 or 4 more times and see how you handle it first though
Hashimotos,eyibcw6,t1_eyfo1u6,1567100063.0,"https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/how-to-lose-weight-with-hashimotos/

This talks about why dieting and working out alot is often bad for the thyroid and what is the better option. 

I cant find the article I read anymore since it was a few months ago. But it basically said since our metabolism is slow we would have to work out and diet at twice the effort of a normal person. But it also said not to follow regular diet rules and lots of exercise like crossfit workouts cause it makes our bodies attack the thyroid more and we gain more weight in return.  Light yoga, walk, weight training are all good until our bodies  simply tell us no."
Hashimotos,eyfm8hx,t3_cwtebc,1567051057.0,"Just remember you have a disorder that is better off getting a healthy  lifestyle in the diet, sometimes not working out to the point of exhaustion to try to lose weight, and accepting that weight loss isn't  going to be exactly the same as your friend who might have lost 60 pounds doing half as much work as you. It sucks and people will constantly say your too lazy or you need to do this or that more. But its easier for them."
Hashimotos,eyflub4,t3_cwtebc,1567050878.0,"Unfortunately losing weight is a lot harder for us. I think I read what the normal work out requirement and diet restrictions are for the average person, for us it takes double at the least. If the minimum is 2 hours a day, then we have to do 4 hours to lose weight. And even that is not much weight. I think as long as you aren't gaining, which is super easy to do, then you are already doing good. Be careful fasting and removing too much cause we already don't  digest food the same and are naturally  low in vitamins."
Hashimotos,exubyei,t3_cubetn,1566581872.0,Theres no way to reverse hashimotos. It's a genetic autoimmune disorder where your body naturally attacks the thyroid. I would say go to a doctor and get proper synthetic t3 because eventually diet and healthy changes can only do so much.

Hashimotos,exdq8x1,t1_exaur8u,1566183553.0,"Hypothyroidism is only linked to the thyroid gland. Hashimotos is an immune disorder that includes or sometimes doesnt  include hypothyroid. Hashimotos causes your immune system to attack the thyroid gland and causes hypothyroid from the constant attack. While hypothyroid causes fatigue,  menstrual issues,  muscles pain, etc all related to low hormones in the thyroid. The main treatment is all the same mostly with the synthetic t3, vitamin D, and dairy or gluten avoidance. But hashimotos is an immune disorder and your body doesnt recover as well as hypothyroid  conditions only can. It's a genetic and natural thing your body will do regardless of any treatment and can often cause other immune issues like celiac. Your ""recovery"" from thyroid issues dont really ever stay perfect even after a good med regimen.  It's kind of like having diabetes 1 versus 2. One is the body not functioning right for life and is often very life threatening without proper care for life while the other is caused with your own choices and can be fixed with better activity and diet. That's why hashimotos is considered a chronic immune disorder and not necessarily a thyroid disorder."
Hashimotos,exani6r,t3_crqflo,1566111589.0,My family has a history of hashimotos so it was pretty much a confirmed thing. But then I took the antibodies test and it came up negative even though I do indeed have it and am on treatment for it rather than just hypothyroid. Apparently sometimes your levels are just too low to be seen with the current testing for it.
CaregiverSupport,ewz11wv,t3_cqeazn,1565889698.0,"I did in home care for my mother for 8 years and it ruined the close relationship I had with her over time. You become the parent to your frustrated parent and it makes things tense.  My mom had life alert, which is helpful as long as your mom will actually use it. Mine wouldn't press her button when she fell and just sat on the floor for hours till we got home. It does a world of difference taking care of someone away from where you live. If you can figure out a good routine and make sure she isn't trying to be too independent on her own when you move out it should be fine. I had to move back in later with my mom cause she was determined she would ""get better"" and would walk around without her walker and try to cook and ate whatever she wanted and forget her insulin when she was in her own. Really depends on the person's ability to  know their own limitations"
Hashimotos,ewvfdeu,t3_cq3wau,1565805092.0,"AIP didnt do much for me and I still felt like crap even though all my levels were normal.

ptsd,ew93qqs,t3_cncbpl,1565219183.0,"The biggest step in recovery is leaving the situation your in. You need to start seeing a therapist as soon as you can cause ptsd isn't necessarily a diagnosis given quickly, and it's not good to diagnose yourself. It will be significantly  harder to recover if your living situation is part of your problems.  I lived in a controlling environment  for a long time WHILE being in therapy for it for 3 years and my positive habits that stayed with me didn't really stick for good until after I left and found my own place and cut contact for awhile. It can be difficult to change the way you behave and think to a more positive route if your living with people who keep disrupting that healing process."

Hashimotos,evu5k66,t3_clb2dj,1564786214.0,I have been dismissed by all my primary care and endos until my latest one about my problems as well. My dosage wasn't  high enough for 3 months and I had horrible fatigue where I would just pass out in the middle of doing something and my feet hurt so bad I couldn't walk. And my primary care told me they wouldn't up my dosage and it probably wasn't related. My new endo gave me a higher dosage after I about passed out even talking to him to try out and I have been feeling 90% better since. But getting a script for it has been work to convince my primary care to prescribe it now. They still don't believe I even have hashimotos even though it runs in my family cause my antibody levels were too low for the test to work on me. It will always be a battle with someone.
ptsd,evm0j1n,t3_ck9iwi,1564601631.0,I went through child sexual abuse that went untreated until I was 18. By the time I started getting the therapy I needed I had already established a pretty unhealthy  sex addiction from age 14 on. I still struggle with it but I think its pretty common. Sometimes my sex drive can be so high but to actually have sex with my spouse can be harder and I avoid it at the same time that I'm involuntarily  horny. It's a strange feeling.
