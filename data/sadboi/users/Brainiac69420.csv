(edit: I've thought about explaining Bipolar disorder (which he suffers from) and what it's like to dissociate and need a break from everything but it's not the type of thing that you can properly explain in writing, closest thing I've found to a good explanation are in a lot of his songs, so I'm just gonna take the downvotes and hope people learn to be more thoughtful and considerate of his feelings in the future.)"
bipolar,f6389el,t3_dpp49a,1572673102.0,So I'm ngl Vraylar was the worst medication I've ever taken in my entire life. I was the most irritable/anxious I've ever been on it. Obviously it varies from person to person but I'm not surprised I've heard so much negative feedback about it lately. Definitely bring this up to your doctor because it can get much worse if they up your dose.
