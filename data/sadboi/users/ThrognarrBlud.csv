thesims,ex19bvq,t3_cr00fn,1565935490.0,"Do you mean a CAS/build mode song will suddenly become ""aggressive"" mid-song? There are 2 versions for many of those songs - a calmer acoustic one and a normal one. 

Usually when you click to a new category or something it will change between the two versions of the current song. I hope that makes sense.

I'm not sure if that is what you meant"

healthyeating,es902zg,t1_es3pu3k,1561722818.0,"Awesome thank you! Can I ask one other question? Regarding carbs. Fruits are so high in carbs. If I am trying to stay under 50g/day and a banana is half of that, do I just avoid fruit? Or have it a few times per week in addition to 50g with meals? Or cut down the carbs in the meals? Thanks!! I am so clueless in this area and really want to have a balanced diet."
