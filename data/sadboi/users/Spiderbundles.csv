schizophrenia,fqjv0bw,t1_fqjpe7h,1589415595.0,"So, interesting fact: Most people think of insomnia as being unable to fall asleep, but there's actually more to it (unfortunately). There are 3 types, basically:

Early Insomnia: Difficulty falling asleep

Middle Insomnia: Difficulty staying asleep (waking up frequently during the night, or waking up during the night and having trouble getting back to sleep)

and Late Insomnia: Waking up significantly earlier than you need to, and being unable to go back to sleep

So if by being a light sleeper you mean you often wake up during the night, you may be dealing with middle Insomnia. Just a random fact that might be interesting 👍"

In my job, though... That won't work :( I'm an assistant in academia, and my job duties vary wildly from day to day, and they *all* involve heavy multitasking. So, there's no structure or routine, and I'm terrible at multitasking, obviously. I've already decided I'll most likely be leaving my job after the semester ends, because of this issue and other health issues. My husband and I were discussing it, and he said that if I decide to get another job, it should be somewhere like food service, where there is clear structure and I can build a routine. I'm actually a certified phlebotomist, so I think I'll go that direction instead. But same thing, it's a simple, straightforward job where you have a routine and your duties are clear. Maybe my current job just isn't the best for me :/

bipolar,fiopbps,t1_fiolnxh,1582587864.0,I get crazy night terrors on Abilify; my doctor thinks it was because of severe sleep deprivation and stress (Abilify does both to me). Reducing my dosage stopped the night terrors.
bipolar,fioo61u,t3_f8zpf8,1582587123.0,"Latuda made me *insane*. Instant, acute, and severe mania. I couldn't sleep at *all,* had to double-dose Benadryl to get even a couple hours. Very disappointing for a medication that cost me $400 of my severance check. I stopped it after 4 days, it was that bad.

Keep in mind, however, that I am very weirdly treatment-resistant, so... YMMV. I hope it does. Good luck!"
bipolar,fionpb2,t3_f904tq,1582586833.0,"This is a large and many-faceted question, so it would be hard to answer it all in one comment. The one above me is great; I would just add that there are a number of really good books geared towards the family and loved ones of people dealing with bipolar. That will help you understand not just her disorder, but how it will affect your relationship. 

Cheers for being willing to reach out and ask for help in understanding. That's the first step, and you nailed it. Best of luck!"

Tiny things elevate an outfit; you can even do the above over a fitted tee and a pair of dark rinse jeans and it works. It's one of my favorite ""I have 5 minutes to walk out the house"" tricks. Hope that helps! :)"

Just be prepared to accept the art school culture, even if you don't assimilate to it yourself.

I'm definitely going to keep doing photos for my journal, and maybe I'll pull out the better ones, and...try to display them? Sell them? I don't know haha But maybe there could be something to doing photography, for me. Thanks for your words!! I'll definitely keep your points in mind 🙂"

bipolar,fhcdhlx,t1_fhbonhz,1581461097.0,"Your comment hit me hard. My childhood story is similar; my dad's mental health issues and substance abuse ripped our family apart and left me with deep psychological scars. It took us 20 years to actually get to a functional father/daughter relationship. My own diagnosis helped me understand him more and forgive him.

My dad never got formally diagnosed, bc he's super in denial about it (but spend a week with him and it's obvious), but he eventually managed to pull himself together. He moved to the country, bought his first house, was doing great at work, stopped drinking. All without meds. I'm super impressed by his will.

...And then, soon after really getting himself together, he was diagnosed with stage 4 congestive heart failure. I barely knew my dad for so many years, bc of his bipolar, and when things finally start to go right, I'm going to lose him again. It's so fucking unfair."
