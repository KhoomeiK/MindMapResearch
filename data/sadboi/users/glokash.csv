I stopped taking Adderall regularly because I was afraid of the side effects and I was abusing it for a while there to continue restricting. It’s a really common thing for people who have EDs and ADD/ADHD to have reactions to Adderall like this. I found when I stopped taking it, I did want to eat more as well as sleep more—but it was temporary. My weight did fluctuate but not by much. I had like a week of those withdrawal-like symptoms and then it passed. I mean, I think you should probably talk to your doctor about your specific situation but I’d also recommend reminding yourself that this situation is temporary and it too shall pass. I also like to take deep breaths when I feel overwhelmed, that really helps me calm myself down.

I didn’t really get help for my ED until high school when my friends were worried and told the school counselor. I was forced to see the counselor for a few sessions where I just made shit up to get out of there because I wasn’t ready for recovery at that time. It wasn’t until I was at university that my ED got much worse and I had to take multiple medical leaves of absence to go to hospital/treatment. Over the years, I was first diagnosed with EDNOS, then bulimia, and then anorexia. I’ve dealt with restricting, binging, purging, over-exercise, as well as other symptoms. 

At this point, I’m 30 years old and still struggle with my ED, but it’s not as bad as it used to be because I’ve learned a lot about myself and how to take better care of myself over the years/times in treatment. However, with the current pandemic, things have been harder to manage so I’m struggling with some of my ED behaviors again. Basically, this shit sucks."

I've talked to my therapist about it in length and I've been practicing disengaging from the conversations when those sorts of topics arise so I either walk away or I make an effort to focus on something else.
