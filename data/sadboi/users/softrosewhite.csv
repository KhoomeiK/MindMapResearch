NintendoSwitch,fr06nvc,t3_glwfgm,1589785372.0,I mean I know my friend lost everything she did on animal crossing and I heard that’s an issue for a lot of other players as well because Nintendo cloud means nothing or whatever it’s called but it might make a difference with an sd card but DONT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. I just wouldn’t risk anything and keep your set up the way it is

ptsd,f31ysve,t3_deymfr,1570588425.0,"Sometimes when I have bad panic attacks to the point of planning my will and expecting to die within 5 minutes (which never happens smh), I'll call one of my friends because I find that distracting myself and just ranting about a random topic that involves a lot of thinking but is useless knowledge helps a lot. A lot of times when I do this my friends can't even tell that I'm panicking and they think I'm fine for the most part. (Usually, before the phone call, I'll tell them that I'm having a panic attack, or right when they answer the phone I'll tell them just super casually and it's never been a bad or awkward time.) You're 100% valid, and I would try to just find something subtle to help ground you. I find that just getting caught up in conversation helps, and even the 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 technique helps a lot. They're casual enough not to bring too much attention if the attention from your friends is not going to help you.
