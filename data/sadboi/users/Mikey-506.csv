WTF,fjomf5m,t1_fjojau5,1583530704.0,"It certainly could be mental illness, most likely related to psychosis.  


Other possibility is its a mixture of psychosis and drug use. Often prolong use of certain drugs can trigger a lingering mental illness like schizophrenia.  


If drugs are involved you can assume the drug or drugs are either a stimulant like meth and/or bath salts (or one of the many variations of the drug created to avoid legal issues). Over time sleep deprivation leaves the mind vulnerable and over taxed as toxins built up and are not able to be flushed out of the brain which I believe is what happens when you sleep.  


If psychedelics such as magic mushrooms or LSD are involved it could have easily triggered psychosis with or without proper nutrition and rest being a factor. All it takes is a strong dose for a weak vulnerable mind with possible underlying mental health issues for psychosis to creep in.

Often bath salts (**methylone** or mephedrone) are used as a substitute for meth. These bath salts often come from over seas in countries with less strict regulations like China. methylone has similar effects (especially at first) to meth but much more savere side effects which can often lead to intense psychosis quite quickly compared to meth ; this rings especially true if the user is not eating, hydrating and sleeping properly which is often not the case.  


TL;DR: Most possibilities all lead to psychosis which is all we see in video; I'm pretty sure either stimulants or a psychedelic (hallucinogens) if related to drugs."
