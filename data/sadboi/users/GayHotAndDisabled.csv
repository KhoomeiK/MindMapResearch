menwritingwomen,fr4z8v4,t1_fr4t9ry,1589899656.0,"Even attractiveness is partially nurture, if you take two twins and give one a nutritionally deficit diet and/or inconsistent access to food, and one a nutritionally complete and healthy diet where they never need to worry about where the next meal is coming from, the one who grew up with consistent access to good, healthy food will be more attractive.

Sufficient, consistent nutrition during childhood results in more symmetrical faces, and symmetrical faces are a key marker for attractiveness.

Also, you growing up in a rough area isn't nature, it's nurture. The ""Nature"" side of this argument argues that the where/why/how/etc of the way you were raised and your experiences don't matter, you are *inherently* the way you are, and nurture argues that it is where/why/how/etc of the way you were raised and your childhood experiences that determine all or most of who you are. 

Personally, I think there is a little bit of nature with an overwhelming amount of nurture involved. But things like 'criminality' aren't nature based -- maybe risk taking, or a lack of ability to understand consequences, are to some small, tiny ass degree nature. But ""crimes"" specifically don't happen for no reason, and their reasons come almost entirely from nurture."

In fact, don’t assume that there are only two genders.""

Bisexuality has never been binary or limited to ""only two"" -- those are definitions that oppressors give us.

At the end of the day, it is up to you what you do, but diagnosis is useful even if you decide against medication, because it can help you understand yourself better. When I got my bipolar DX, it was like a massive lightbulb moment. 

Good luck!"

Psychosis,fptjsij,t1_fptiigc,1588892564.0,"Ah yeah, I've no idea what the injection dose is. 

I would suggest along your Psychiatrist about other med options. Do they know you have a family history of bipolar? It might effect their diagnosis. 

You mentioned your anxiety makes talking with your psych difficult, do you know if you can email them, or if that might help?"
Psychosis,fpthwyj,t1_fptgbbf,1588891564.0,"Abilify is not given at those doses (highest is generally 30mg/day) so I will assume that was a typo. 

If you stop your medication, you will likely return to your symptoms. That is, after all, why you are on them in the first place. However, you may be able to try other medications, rather than being unmedicated entirely. You mentioned mood swings -- are you DX'd bipolar? If so, you may be able to switch to a mood stabilizer, rather than be taking an Antipsychotic. Options include Lamotrogine, Lithium, and Valproate, and they *tend to* have lower risk profiles long-term than APs (litium is riskier and involves regular dose adjustments and bloodwork, but the others are rather low-risk)."
Psychosis,fpt07yf,t1_fpszb8f,1588882612.0,"Nearly every medicine and poison are plants. Nightshade, a deadly poison, is a plant. Cocaine is a plant. Aspirin comes from plants. Something being ""natural"" does not equal safe, and even if something is generally safe (like weed, or many many medications) that doesn't mean that it is safe for everyone. 

Is weed less likely than, say, lsd to cause psychosis? Yes! But everything has risks, and for some part of the population, weed can cause psychosis. It's *literally* a hallucinagenic drug, though a mild one. 

Hell, I took a Very Safe drug for my bipolar and ended up with a rare side effect that could've killed me. Doesn't make the drug not safe, just means it's not safe *for me*."
Psychosis,fpsyh37,t1_fpsxw3r,1588881752.0,"Yes, I'm wondering what, specifically, you are worried it is doing to your body. Plenty of people take medication daily for the rest of their life -- epileptics and diabetics spring to mind, but also people w/autoimmune disorders, hormonal issues, heart problems, asthma...the list goes on and on -- so 'depending' on a medication is not necessarily bad. 

I'm not going to argue that you shouldn't go off the medication. I'm currently not medicated for my psychosis, and I haven't been for years. I'm not saying you can't manage your psychosis without meds, I am just trying to give specific responses so I can best address your concerns."
Psychosis,fpsxoxm,t3_gfd0mu,1588881376.0,"It all depends on which AP, how fast you go off it, what your condition is, and your own unique reaction to the meds.

Psychosis,fpq68mp,t3_gex0iz,1588815996.0,"It is almost certainly Psychosis. Specifically, your brain is making connections where there aren't any, a thing I call ""psychotic thinking"" but idk it's actual name. For me, it happens right before my delusions start solidifying.

Your anxiety, however, is entirely understandable. What your mind is telling you is happening is terrifying. 

I also have bipolar! You are probably manic right now, it often causes very very intense anxiety. I'd see if you psychiatrist can do online appointments (I have one scheduled for Friday myself!) to talk about treatment options. 

Best thing right now is for you to get some sleep, even if you don't feel tired. Mania can really fuck with the sleep schedule, and one of the ways to make psychosis worse is to sleep less. 

Good luck, friend."
