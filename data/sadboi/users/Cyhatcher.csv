lexapro,fnq14u1,t1_fn00pfs,1587155707.0,"How is this going? I’m on Day 1 of the same, dropping Lexapro by 1/2 doses for a week and then starting Zoloft."
adhd_anxiety,fnl6xsz,t1_f7n1paw,1587048174.0,"This is very similar to my experience-was on SSRIs for almost 10 years before my psychiatrist suggested I was still pretty anxious. The ADHD diagnosis and treatment was life changing. I am actually allergic to Wellbutrin and thought I was dying of some obscure condition...

I take Vyvanse now and still Lexapro but experience pretty regular and semi debilitating bouts of anxiety. I’m meeting with my doctor today to talk about switching anxiety meds but part of me wants to see if the Vyvanse will work on it’s own. 

Could I ask about your other coping mechanism? Standard stuff like exercise and meditation? Any diet changes you found effective? Any books or resources that were helpful for you? Thank you!"
Anxiety,fnl5tlp,t1_fliru0z,1587047561.0,Lexapro made a major difference for my obtrusive thoughts but that’s about the only anxiety symptom it improved for me. I’m also being treated for ADHD and finding it SUCH. Hard balance between what improves focus but doesn’t increase anxiety...good luck!
