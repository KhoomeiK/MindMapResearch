depression,fbw9rn8,t3_eep17n,1577144291.0,"I know it's scary but try to open up to your loved ones about how you're feeling. Even just entertain the thought in your mind, because you'll find that other people often feel the same way. Once you verbalise it, actually speak it and communicate your feelings, you realise what is and isn't reality. I can get bad anxiety where negativity is amplified. Real world things become disproportionately dreadful inside my mind. So I talk about the real world thing and how my mind interprets it to the people I love, and they listen, and I realise that part of it was my mental health the whole time. I am glad you have loved ones, and I'm sure you understand that you have to be honest with them. Even if it's just saying ""I'm not feeling too well"". That's a massive step. Good luck, and be kind to yourself xx"

AskMen,fbsdr5b,t3_eeasfg,1577053859.0,"Try to process why you get jealous. I get jealous because I feel insecure about past relationships failing and because my partner has had more relationships than I have. They aren't things that should logically make me jealous, but emotionally I can't help being negative and insecure. What helps me is talking about it with my partner, and catching myself when I start to go down a jealous path. It's tough and takes time, gotta be patient and kind with yourself and with your SO."
AskMen,fbsd5dt,t3_eeayrm,1577053613.0,"I enjoy being in the same room while he's playing videogames and I'm playing games on my phone or reading, it's really comfortable and relaxing. I think I like doing things together more, though (but need a balance of both for sure!). So playing a game together or watching something together, and every week or so having a date night or sharing an experience outside the house is really important to me :)"

depression,fbqh88v,t3_ee58qm,1577031613.0,"Hopefully she can change, it may be that she has her own problems too and doesn't know how to process emotions. That would explain it but doesn't justify the hurt caused. Stay strong and stay true to yourself. You're not a joke and you know it, and please seek support (from friends, Reddit, professionals etc) if you can because it's so important to remember that you're not alone in this. Good luck. xx"
unpopularopinion,fb7cta9,t3_ebls19,1576585540.0,"That's just your bias. It's not that you can't help it, it's that you've learned to conform to discriminatory social pressure aka finding overweight people unattractive. That leads to microaggressions like this, where people want to normalise calling a group of people unattractive and even seek approval for it. Do the work. Do better."
