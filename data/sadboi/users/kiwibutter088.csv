explainlikeimfive,f50ah60,t3_dm1pe8,1571924365.0,"There are chemicals in everyone's brain that are what make us feel emotions. If you are happy, scared, or in love you feel it because you brain uses these chemicals to tell you.

There is a chemical called Serotonin that is the happy chemical.

&#x200B;

Happiness and sadness work like a light in you bedroom. You can turn on just a night light and its mostly dark with a little bit of light to see you you can turn on the big light and everything is nice and bright. But you can't make the room any darker. The more Serotonin your brain makes the happier you are and the less it makes the sadder you are. Depression and sadness are different because when you are sad there is a reason you brain stopped making the Serotonin for a little while so you feel the feelings you are supposed to. When someone is depressed the brain is a little broken and can't make Serotonin. That's like if your big light broke and you had to use your night light to play and pick out your clothes.

&#x200B;

When you are scared at night sometimes your brain tries to make sense of things in the dark and you end up thinking a coat rack is a monster. When someone is depressed their brain tried to make sense of those bad feelings too. It makes people think they are bad and that they will never feel better, but that's not true.

&#x200B;

I think that empty feeling is a when someone depressed wants to feel happy but their brain can't make that happy chemical. It's like trying to see in the dark."

bbbs,eura6ez,t1_eur8ao9,1563991505.0,"I've not had any discussions with her. I know that her mom has gone out once after a wedding and got home late. My Little watched her siblings for her mom and we talked about how that was a nice thing for her to do for her mom but never brought up alcohol or where she was until 2 am (this is the only time I know of her mom doing this and they did have an aunt with them until her siblings went to bed).

&#x200B;

We were also talking last week about how she is excited for her Pap's wedding next month because she gets to get dressed up and dance. She said shes only been to one wedding before.

&#x200B;

I don't plan on drinking too much of course but of course I'd like to have some at my own wedding. I guess either way, if she was in the wedding or just a guest she would see that. I just don't want to be a bad influence. I didn't drink in High School but a lot of kids do and I don't want to make it seem cool."
bbbs,eur72ph,t1_eur45j4,1563990375.0,"I had already decided that if I ask her, I would be very clear that I would not want gifts for either the shower or the wedding.

I understand the point of a Little is to spend time one on one - which is what I always do, but I thought including her might make her feel special. More so than just inviting her to the wedding - in which I also wouldn't be able to spend one on one time with her. Even less time really.

I'm more concerned with the alcohol more than anything else. Especially since she will be weeks away from starting High School. 

Thanks for your input on the siblings though!"

It does not mean to stand by the president or any other public official, save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country. It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country. In either event, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the president or anyone else.‚Äù - Theodore Roosevelt"
relationship_advice,eskrxd8,t1_esjm70k,1562072296.0,"I'm going to share two stories I think could give you a different perspective.

I had a female friend that in college thought shes was bi. She started dating a girl. She thought the female body was sexy. She liked getting pleasured by the girl. She realized she was freaked out by lady bits when it was her turn. She didn't like vaginas. She decided that even though she found women attractive, she was not ""bi enough"" (since sexuality is a spectrum) to be with one.

The other story is about a different friend. Her birthday was coming up and we were planning a trip. I mentioned inviting the girl from the first story while she was still in a realationship with that girl. The birthday girl absolutely refused. 'no way, thats creepy, im not sleeping in the same room as a lesbo, ect.' Birthday girl would always make sexual jokes about guys she dated, talked about how much she wanted it from attractive guys we'd see. She is 100% gay now.
