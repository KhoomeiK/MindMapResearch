Vent,fptptn0,t3_gfhjf1,1588895851.0,"do you expect them to bow down to you every second? maybe they have a lot going on in their lives too with this virus. have you asked if they're doing okay? have you offered to help them at all? you giving them work has probably helped them so much seeing as lots of places are closed. instead of complaining maybe have a sit down talk with them? communication is everything, and kindness goes a long way.

and if you do end up letting them go, maybe it's time to learn some hobbies and do things yourself!"

I did start to force myself to do some hobbies. In this case do anything you can to distract yourself. Reading is good, learning new things, it‚Äôs really neat how much you can learn about yourself too while you‚Äôre hurting. You become a better person especially when you‚Äôre going through things. You‚Äôll learn your worth. Good-luck friend x"
