1. We saw Amber continually stress how much she wanted a baby.  Could have been fake who knows but we did see her say that. 
2. Amber shouldn't have been pregnant and off her meds that long.  She desperately needs them to function.
3. Do we think she actually abused James? I feel like she has a pattern of abusing the men in her life but not the children.  That would be really new for her.  Did she ***NEGLECT*** Leah, yes but she never pushed her down or shoved her, to our knowledge?  Plus I'm sure Gary wouldn't let Amber see her if she was physically assaulting Leah. 

Either way Amber sucks, Andrew sucks. They all suck.  She's an abuser and MTV enables her, especially it sounds like on the reunion (haven't watched yet)."

She doesn't try to better her mental health and how she treats people at all and I completely agree.  But there is a reason for the way that she is and I think understanding that is helpful.  Again not excusing her actions as you've stated.

I grew up in a Christian household, super conservative and terrible, was raped like possibly Farrah and have PTSD because of that and another traumatic event in my life.  I have received help, go to therapy weekly, and take my therapists advice to heart and try to better myself.  I was just saying, like you also stated, that I do have empathy for the things she's been through and I understand it has caused her to lash out at others and make horrible decisions.
