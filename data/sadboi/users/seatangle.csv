EatingDisorders,fr54r5s,t3_gmliyp,1589902482.0,"Night was also the hardest time for me. Here are a few things that helped me.

\- Set up a new routine that rewards you for not binging or purging - some activity that you aren't able to do while you binge and purge and that makes you feel good. Could be something as simple as getting into bed with a cup of tea, turning down the lights and reading until you fall asleep, with the knowledge that you'll wake up feeling good rather than ""hungover"" from purging. With time, you'll come to look forward to that activity and the benefits of that will far outweigh B/P.

\- Don't have food that you will want to binge on readily available. This might be hard if your city is in lockdown and you can't go grocery shopping all the time. But this helped me when I was first starting out because I would just have to wait for the grocery stores around me to close at night, and then it was almost impossible for me to binge. It makes it easier when you know you only have to wait until like 10pm, and then binging is simply not an option. For me, I'd feel intense anxiety up until that closing time, but then when it passed it would be such a relief.

\- If you can, spend time with someone or call someone. You don't have to tell them you're struggling. Ask them to watch a movie or a show with you and you've bought yourself at least another hour without B/P.

\- Think about all the negative consequences. This didn't work for me when I was younger and basically felt invincible, but as I got older the addiction really started to wear on me and I got scared about my teeth and stuff. It also made me break out and caused my glands to be swollen all the time. I just wanted to know what my face would look like when I was healthy, so that was a good motivator. Think also about how much better it feels to wake up in the morning knowing you didn't binge or purge the night before. Write it all down and look at it when you are thinking of binging.

Overall, I think the main idea is to sort of train your brain to associate binging and purging with negative consequences, and abstaining with positive consequences. Right now it's just wired the other way around, but with time that will change if you keep at it. I hope something I've written here helps, I know how hard it is!"
tolkienfans,fr5088x,t1_fr4kwbj,1589900164.0,"I've read from a couple of sources that their relationship was either based on or could be likened to that of an officer and ""batman"" (orderly or soldier-servant), which is something Tolkien would have observed during WWI. It's a relationship I think it would be hard to find a comparison for today. I've read that sometimes they would form an invaluable bond, as they would have relied on each other in life-or-death situations, and it wasn't unheard of that the batman would go on to serve the officer after the war as a domestic servant.

*“My ‘Sam Gamgee’ is indeed a reflexion of the English soldier, of the  privates and batmen I knew in the 1914 war, and recognized as so far  superior to myself.” A batman, in military parlance, was a soldier who  (as well as being required to fight) was tasked with looking after an  officer’s kit, cooking, and cleaning. Tolkien’s phrasing in the letter  sent to Minchin is different, and very interesting too: “My ‘Samwise’ is  indeed (as you note) largely a reflexion of the English soldier—grafted  on the village-boys of early days, the memory of the privates and my  batmen that I knew in the 1914 War, and* ***recognized as so far superior to  myself***.”

I understand the confusion around dysphoria and body dysmorphia. When I look back at my experience, I think I had both. One doesn't rule out the other. 

One thing that really confused me about my ED is that at the time, this hatred for my body seemed to come out of nowhere. It was only many years later that I realized I was NB and it had a lot to do with not wanting a woman's body, so it was this dysphoria that I did not have the words for at the time that drove the ED. Throughout the worst of my ED I presented a lot more feminine than I do now, but right around the time I started figuring out my gender the ED had less power and my ideas about my body started to change, too.

I guess what I am trying to say is that maybe you do not need to regret anything, it can be that both things were driving your decision and that does not invalidate it. The gendered words we choose to identify ourselves aren't strict categories, and if you decide over time that one fits better than the other it doesn't mean there wasn't some truth in what was motivating you in the past."

Teammates shouldn't want you to be banging your head against the wall. In general, a good rule is to ""get stuck"" for 30-45mins, and then if you are going nowhere, it's time to ask questions. A little bit of struggling is good, as long as it's productive. I say this because I realized I was wasting too much time floundering at the beginning, when it would have been more productive to just ask for help sooner.

If you're asking questions when you need to and the team is still not being helpful, then I think that's probably a sign they aren't set up to support you properly. It might have something to do with the physical distance being an impediment to communication, but it might also have been a problem even when they were not WFH."

cscareerquestions,fpwrq1j,t1_fpwjftt,1588968756.0,"I guess this isn't the case for everyone, but I can follow my own routine and keep myself accountable without having it thrust on me. I still shower daily in lock down, because I work out at night, and I don't want to go to bed all gross. I might have started getting out of bed just 40mins before morning standup, but my work doesn't suffer for it. I don't mind working into the evening anymore because I know that I'm not going to have to face a long commute home on a crowded subway. I just close my mac, turn off my monitor, and walk away. I'm not a morning person, I work better later in the day, so having that sort of relative flexibility has been great. When I was going into the office work wasn't necessarily off my mind once I got home, anyway. There were times where I got home from my 1.5 hour commute only to start working again. 

Commuting is such a huge waste of time. Not having to commute hours every day has also given me a lot more time to pursue my own interests, take care of my dog, and socialize (from a distance) with friends and family. Maybe, maybe if I lived 30mins from work I might adjust to that, but I still don't see any reason for going to a physical location 5 days a week when my work can easily be done from home. 

In terms of having the motivation to go out and do things, if anything I've had more energy now and desperately want to get out. Before it took a huge amount of effort because I just wanted to recover on the weekends and evenings. I actually have diagnosed social anxiety, and I find having copious time alone gives me lots of time to recharge so I actually want to call people up (whereas before I just felt drained from being around people all day). Weekly video sessions with my therapist help too.

It's definitely different for everyone, maybe a matter of personality mixed with life experience. Personally, I think my QOL would drastically improve in a non-COVID-19 work from home situation.

EatingDisorders,fpo33qd,t3_geh0u8,1588777508.0,"I don't know what the psychology behind it is. Maybe it has something to do with a fixed mental image that we have of ourselves that doesn't change or catch up to what our actual physical appearance is, at least that is what it has felt like to me while in the throes of an ED.

However, this is one sort of ammunition I have in my arsenal when I feel horrible about the weight I've gained in recovery: I remind myself that in the past, no matter how much weight I lost, I always felt just as bad if not worse about my body. Losing weight is not the answer to ""fix"" dysmorphic thoughts. It has never gotten me anywhere.

Another thing I've noticed is that I am kind of afraid to accept my body. I think I may have developed an even more negative way of thinking about my body as a defense. I feared that through accepting my body, I would allow myself to slip - become lazy and gain a lot of weight. However, none of this really explains why my body image was so bad in the first place, or what causes the dysmorphia initially. When I think about the time when m ED was developing, I was very deeply unhappy with my life, and it could be that my body became a convenient scapegoat. 

I imagine the psychology behind body dysmorphia (or, more broadly, negative body image) would be different for everyone, based on your experiences, culture, maybe even genetic predisposition. Also important to note that Body Dysmorphic Disorder is its own disorder, not everyone with AN, BN, or other EDs automatically has BDD, but they likely experience dysmorphia."

Dear \[Governor Cuomo / Board members\],

I am writing to express my deep disappointment and outrage at losing my right to vote for a Democratic nominee in June. I understand that the state is going through an unprecedented crisis, but I believe this is all the more reason to keep our democracy as strong as we can. Co-chair of the NY State Board of Elections Douglas Kellner called the election a ""beauty contest."" It troubles me greatly that leadership which is in place to protect our democracy does not appear to understand the implications of the Democratic Primary that go beyond candidate nomination.

In addition to selecting a nominee, the Democratic Primary is a chance for candidates to secure delegates to represent them at the Democratic National Convention. This is an opportunity for voters to influence the party and the platform, and by canceling the primary that right has been stripped. Canceling the primary is also a problem because it means that voter turnout will likely be affected for progressives down the ballot, which has implications locally. On that point, it does not make sense to cancel one primary election, while still holding others where voters are required to vote in-person. This suggests that this decision is not about health or safety, but instead an act of voter suppression.

As Representative Ocasio-Cortez suggests, the pandemic is not an excuse for canceling a primary, as ballots can be mailed. This is the route New York should take, and a measure it should extend beyond the pandemic, as mailed ballots will make it easier for New Yorkers to exercise their right to vote regardless of where they live or how they work, or what commitments they have outside of work. This is an opportunity to improve our democracy, not threaten it.

Please restore the right for New Yorkers to vote in the Democratic presidential primary. I hope you will consider these points. Thank you for your time.

Best wishes,

\[name\]

Legend is that the clan was largely left-handed. I guess this is probably coincidental, though, that the Basque sounds so much like the surname of a clan that was mostly left-handed, since the origin of Kerr most likely comes from old Norse (*kjarr*).

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan\_Kerr#Left-handedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Kerr#Left-handedness)

I also wonder if there could be a possible connection with *izquierda* to the English *queer*, it seems the origins of this word aren't certain, but interestingly also mentions a Scottish Gaelic root.

I enjoy coding more than I did design. I also enjoy that I can make a good living out of it. I know I'm never going to work for a FANG or whatever, and I don't even want to. That was never my goal. I just want to be able to learn, code, make cool stuff, and not have to worry about how I'm going to pay rent. 

I think that's okay, you know? You don't have to be obsessed with tech. Like you, I want to work remotely. I want to have time off to travel and spend time with family. I like coding but is not my life. I don't think that's anything to feel bad about."

For instance, the other day I was talking to a friend on a video call and I could hear an intermittent beeping noise. It seemed really loud to me and I was sure it was my smoke alarm beeping because of low batteries. I couldn’t focus on anything she was saying so I went to fix my smoke alarm.

EatingDisorders,fnm4x0d,t3_g2c2gp,1587065154.0,"Don’t just look at weight. If a patient is coming to you for help, they probably need it.

When I was about 16 my Mom took me to my GP, I was making myself throw up. He basically weighed me and told us to come back if things got worse. Well, they did. I ended up becoming severely anorexic. “Worse” can be too late. Catching EDs early is important, I think (not that there is any less hope for recovery later on - I’m now healthy).

I’ve also experienced what I would consider a lack of sensitivity from another doctor I saw. So some general training on sensitivity could help. It would be good if doctors were aware of things like not discussing weight, or possibly asking patients who have disclosed a history of EDs if they would prefer to not know their weight."

Now we can only choose between two candidates that we know will only continue to make the country worse. Both are liars, both are accused rapists, and neither really gives a fuck about any of us. At least Biden is pro-choice and does not actively promote hate. I’ll choose the lesser of two evils but will feel disgusted doing so."
