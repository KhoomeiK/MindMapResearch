They're basically voting for trump by doing nothing.Trump is about to gut Medicare and SSDI, that'll hurt the most vulnerable people in our country, but that's cool a bunch of Dems don't wanna  go vote against that happening because they're too purist to go vote for Biden etc, that would never touch those benefits now.
