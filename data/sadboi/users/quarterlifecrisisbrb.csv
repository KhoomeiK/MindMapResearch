I'm sorry for what I had done to you. I feel like I may of contributed partially to your death but I had to do what was right at the time. I know you miss your daughters and they miss you, we all do but you couldn't bring the girls up and take drugs in the house and push your responsibility on others.

We tried to help you but you kept so much secret and I'm sorry that we didn't believe you when you were crying out for help. We didn't know the extent of pain and suffering you were enduring, we didn't believe everything you had said, we didn't know how far gone you were and I'm sorry.

I know you didn't have the best life, you went through so much heart break, pain and the ones that were supposed to love you abandoned you in your time of need. You were struggling from day one and we didn't notice until it was too late. We didn't know that you held on to your past so much, going through the pain of lost loved ones, people who hurt and degraded you, people who made you daily life a struggle.

The girls are in a better place now. They're with a nice family who are looking after them well and I'm sorry that we were so blind to what was happening to your daughters. Their father won't be near them anymore and they are safe. They miss you so much and love you. I don't know how the girls will be as they grow up and honestly I hope they avoid the path you took for their own sanity. 

We haven't told them fully how you passed away. There will come a day where we will explain it to them but they're too young to understand and we don't want to cause them anymore pain. 

I'm sorry that you died alone. I don't know what to believe. It may of been ruled as an accident but I think your life was cut short by the hand of someone else. We should of been there, we could of helped you but at the same time, I think you passing has helped you leave the pain behind and you can sit peacefully watching your daughters grow up.

I know I haven't been the best little sister. I know we argued a lot, had different opinions and didn't truly get along and I regret so many things that I had said and done to you. I wish you were still here and I love you so much and my life isn't the same without my big sister. 

I hope you're at peace, sitting with nan and enjoying yourself. I'm sorry and I love you...."

Never had the feeling of wanting to marry him however the feeling of needing a restraining order was there. 

1. He had an obsession with my eldest niece, we'll call her Sarah, and hated my youngest niece for no apparent reason.
   1. I told him their names and one day Sarah was visiting with my sister. Sarah was three at this point. I was on Skype with Mike and told him Sarah was here and wanted to talk. They spoke for a couple of minutes and Sarah left. Mike then told me he had saved pictures of Sarah off my facebook and saved them as his desktop background, (*he had never met her*).
   2. He decided to write a short story based on Sarah. Within the first sentence, he had killed off my youngest niece, he then proceeded to focus on ""Queen Sarah."" He had cut the sentence shorter and shorter until the words Queen Sarah was all you could see.
   3. When I broke up with him after multiple reasons he decided to go to the woods and write both my nieces a letter and posted this on his Tumblr. Told them how he was going to learn to drive and take them to Toys 'R' Us, how they were beautiful and wanted to paint them, call himself their uncle etc.
2. He had some strange obsessions from the beginning.
   1.  We dated for less than a month and within the first week, he was on about us having children wanting to name them Germanica and Britannica and how we should get a hairless cat. 
   2. He had a lot of Nazi memorabilia and was incredibly proud of it.
   3. He was obsessed with the military often wearing military jackets and helmets.
   4. Slender Man. His obsession got that bad he stood in the woods behind his house screaming for Slender Man to come out.
3. He was just rude.
   1. My nan passed away during this time, one of the causes of her death was cancer. On the way home from the hospital with my dad and sister, he decided to make a cancer joke. Then when I told him it was wrong tried to blame me.
   2. I visited him a few days later to leave my dad to grieve in peace, during that time he tried to force me to have sex. I told him no I was upset about my nans passing, he tried a little longer and got bored when I wouldn't react and told me I make him feel like a man. 
   3. Was on about his ex-girlfriend who he was in a long term relationship with, said how if he saw her again he would be nice to her face and when she wasn't looking he would strangle her.
   4. When me and my family were sorting through my nans stuff, he kept messing asking me to talk to him. I explained what had happened and I would message him when I was done.10 minutes later I kept getting miss calls and texts asking if I was done.
   5. He asked me after we broke up if we could pretend we were still together because he would get the blame for us breaking up. I told him no and that everyone already knew since you publicly posted stories and letters towards my niece etc.

If more pops into my head I'll edit the post and add them but that's all I can think of at the moment. I did have a look at his profile a few years ago. He is now a girl so yeah."

Time goes by so fast because you're so caught up in talking about any problems you have. It'll come across as difficult but you just have to remember, this person doesn't know you, they won't judge you on what you've been through or even what you want to talk about.

It took six sessions for me to finally realize what my therapist had got from my first session, abandonment issues. It took me talking about how I hate my birthday and how I was left alone so much and no one knew and crying my eyes out for me to realize that abandonment is one of my biggest fears.

In regards to your employer, you won't lose you job because of mental illness. It took me a couple of years to speak to my employer about it but they're pretty good and when I'm going through a bad episode, they give me time off so I can have time to myself and process what I am truly going through. A good boss will always listen and provide any support they can without pushing your boundaries. 

I've always been brought up in a house where we wouldn't speak about these problems. I'm 26 now and I still struggle to speak to my family but knowing I have a good support system at work and to speak to someone who essentially doesn't know me is what keeps me going. 

Medication can be addictive but the doctors will help you come off medication slowly. Stopping completely can be bad so a professional will help you do this and will be with you every step. If you think medication can help you push for it. It's trial and error but you'll find the right one. It's taken me three attempts to get the right medication but it was worth it.

They definitely skim on jobs that should be done properly because they know the new homeowners will have to call out the contractors to come to a fix the problem in which the contractors will then profit. 

I'd rather buy an expensive house that has been stood for 80+ years than an expensive house that was built in a few months and is practically falling apart but then again, the likelihood of me owning my own house is extremely slim.

I can see his point, he is lonely, old and lives on-site but he will work himself to death.

We had a large Christmas party for about 200 people working for Tesco. (Tesco Christmas parties are literally hell.) Anyway, the party had finished and the lights came back on. I went to collect any empty glasses and picked up an empty one.  Some drunk 40+ old woman decided to tell me to leave her drink alone and that I am getting on her nerves, (this is the first time I had ever seen her.)

Anyway, they all move up to the top bar and me and my friend go up there to serve. This guy comes to the bar and orders a shot. My friend tells him is x amount. He says he isn't paying and walks off. We let the night manager know and she told us to get the payment. If he refused to pay then we close the bar down.

The guy refused to pay so we shouted last orders and that was it. The whole room erupted. ""The bars 24/7 that's why I picked to stay here!"" ""You're pissing me off even more!"" etc

Next minute the night porters came up told us to go home and they shut down the bar. The room went pretty quiet after that. Turn up for shift a couple of days later and the manager apologised not realising how bad that group was.

Anyway, the guy decided to pull the race card on me and shouted as loud as he could ""Oh look the Asian guy isn't paying!"" Literally, no one said a thing to the guy so I did and told him yes you're right. You're not paying your bill. That's £10.50 please.

There is a large dining room table in the middle of the room so as I got up I looked down to avoid bumping into the chairs. As I got to the end of the table I lifted my head up and looked into the living room. 

In the middle of the room, there was a large shadow. Towards the ground, it was faded and reached just under the ceiling lights. The lights were off in the living room so only the light from the dining room was lighting it up. I stepped closer towards the shadow and it left the room into the hallway. I opened the door and looked into the hallway and it went back into the living room. I followed it again for it to go back into the hallway and then the living room. As I walked into the living room it then went up through the ceiling and into my dad's bedroom. 

I ran into the kitchen, got some food and barricaded the dining-room door. I ended up turning all of the lights on and went back to the computer. 

A couple of hours passed and I forgot about the shadow and decided to go to bed. My bedroom is above the dining room so whatever I saw was still in my dad's room next to mine. 

I turn off the computer and the lights and head upstairs. As I'm getting ready for bed I turn on my tv as background noise. Around 15 mins later I turn off the TV and lights to go to sleep. At this point, the house is dead silent. 

I'm not sure how much time had passed when this happened but it freaked me out for a good year. As I was falling asleep I could hear a loud bang coming from the computer desk below my room. It wasn't just one bang. It was consistent. Same pace, same sound etc.

I rang my dad and sister but neither of them answered. The banging still continued. Bang...Bang...Bang... The desk we had at the time for the computer was an old vintage wooden desk. The top was thin and would make a distinct noise when you dropped anything on it. 

This carried on for about an hour so I rang my dad and sister again. Nothing. Now it got louder and faster. If someone had broken into the house and was punching this desk, their hand would be in so much pain after a short while. 

Eventually, I fell asleep. I woke up around 9 am the next morning and the banging was still going at the same pace and same sound. My dad then arrived home. I could hear him get out of his car, the banging was still going. He got to the door chatting to my step mum, the banging still going. He put his key in the door, still going. He opened the door and it stopped. Nothing. Just stopped dead. 

I ran down to explain this to my dad and step mum and they didn't believe me. I took them to the desk to show them the noise and put it down to the pipes.

Nothing like this has happened since so it was just a one-off. 

I know this post is long and a mess, I do apologise."
AskReddit,evcbo2o,t3_cgwq6o,1564411437.0,"Horrific and creepy at the same time. Dated a ""nice guy"" in college who was friends in a group of ""nice guys."" 

The guy I dated ended up having a fixation on my three-year-old niece who he had never met, going as far as to save a picture of her off my facebook and saving it as his background picture, writing stories about her whilst ""killing off"" my younger niece and writing a letter to them both in the middle of the wood about taking them to Toys 'R' Us and how they are so beautiful he wants to paint a picture of them. 

Tried to claim he was there for me when my nan died only to make a cancer joke right in front of my family 1 hour after we left the hospital. Tried to force himself on me and when I lay there motionless he told me I make him ""feel like a man."" 

When I dumped him he bombarded me with calls about how he is not a paedophile and that he is a nice guy. He then asked if we could pretend that we were still dating as everyone would blame him for us breaking up. 

There were a lot of red flags with this guy and I only ""dated"" him for less than a month.

The best part is, he is now a woman."
