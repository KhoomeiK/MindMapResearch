AmItheAsshole,fjce5n3,t3_fclhar,1583216700.0,"YTA! was she doing risky shit? no! she was being a supportive friend and a FUCKING YOUNG ADULT!!! she was being a GOOD friend, she was exploring the world outside of her (presumably stifling,unpleasant and restrictive) home. this type of behavior will destroy your relationship beyond the typical ‘teenage attitude and disagreements’ 

your daughters relationship with you is clearly weak/untrusting as is , or else she wouldn’t have felt the need to omit where she was going.
watch your steps , or you’ll end up with no relationship with your daughter at all."

just because YOU can’t do something and have some type of superiority complex, doesn’t mean that other people don’t work hard for their skills and money, and are not valid. sorry you have to be so bitter about such a minimal thing, hope your VERY valid and and VERY important job treats you well, asshole!

Also, if you're just starting out don't get frustrated ! Things can turn out terribly without the right measurements and process but it gets easier the more you work with it .
Also make sure you're wearing gloves and a mask and have good airflow. I recommend testing blanks for your first run to avoid ruining any items you may want to place inside ! Also having a journal where you can take notes on what does and doesn't work is a lifesaver.
