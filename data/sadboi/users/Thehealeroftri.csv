nba,fr2tkdq,t1_fr2st8e,1589843623.0,"Our biggest FA signing of all time was *Carlos Boozer*.   

I'm not very confident in our chances at signing a good free agent.  The only way things work out to get a championship would be if Donovan takes an absolute leap to being an unquestionable superstar which is more than likely not going to happen and also signing an above average player as a free agent.  

I think our best chance at ever winning a championship would be drafting a superb player in the mid first round (i.e. picking the next giannis/kawhi).  The chances of that happening are miniscule, but if it did happen then we'd want our reputation to be that of an organization that values its players above all else, and that's the reason I think signing Rudy to the supermax wouldn't be as bad as everyone else thinks it is.  Will we win a championship with a Gobert/Mitchell led team? Probably not. But it does set a precedent for possible future players that our organization is going to respect them and won't give up on them quickly."

Mitchell carried our offense in the games we won, but there's no way we're in that series without Rudy.  Westbrook absolutely could not figure out what to do with him in the paint and this led to Paul George being forced to step up.  This is the situation that created probably the peak of the jingling memes and the playoff P memes after the series.  PG just couldn't hit shots and westbrook was struggling against gobert."
nba,fr2esg2,t1_fr2afy3,1589836025.0,"Well, the ultimate goal is obviously a championship but I think we need to realize that we're not in a very good position to ever get that far.  Rudy is a fan favorite and has been loyal to our organization (not to mention he's an elite defensive player despite what's been said in recent months due to his negative press).  

The best thing we can do is show players (and potential future players) that we're an organization who prizes loyalty above everything else.  If we dump Rudy and try to get a big name free agent not only will we fail, but we'll also make our team worse significantly."

trashy,fpylcfa,t1_fpyi5sk,1589005795.0,"I used to work Netflix CS and I had a few calls where people learned it ""the hard way""

The most memorable is when I got a call once in which a woman called and said she'd forgotten her password.  I went into her profile and discovered an absolute mess of calls that'd taken place for this account in the past week and a half or so.  What it seems happened is the woman caller and her boyfriend broke up and they couldn't decide who should get the Netflix account.  The credit card number was in the guys name, but the email on the account was in her name. 

  Regrettably for the two involved these are the only two ways that Netflix will judge your account.

Ever since they'd broken up both had called customer service to get the account back in their name whenever it was revealed the other was using the account (it was a 1 screen only account).  

Other CS agents did a quick fix in which the email and password were changed and the caller could get back into their account.  I went the extra mile and alerted the caller of the fact that her ex boyfriend could call back and change it again as long as he had the payment method on file. She declined to change it and the call ended.

A few days later my wife (who worked Netflix CS at the time with me) told me that she had gotten the same woman and the account history had kept up the same pattern.  This time she let the woman know that if the caller knew both the email, the card on file, and account details then the password could be switched every time someone called.

The woman ended up changing the email to one she hadn't used before, she changed the card information on the account, and renamed the profiles so her ex couldn't get in to the account.

I still don't know whose account it originally was."
