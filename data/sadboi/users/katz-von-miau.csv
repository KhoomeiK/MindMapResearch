German,fqdeprs,t1_fqd621o,1589288006.0,"I had a similar experience. I studied in Tübingen during uni after having learned German from northerners. It’s a very different dialect, but you will find the majority of people can speak very clear Hochdeutsch, especially professors and people working in a professional environment. There were some people I could never understand though. This included my roommates, some classmates, and older people I would talk to. Swabian was just something I wasn’t accustomed to. I could never get used to “Servus”, people thought it was a little weird when I said “Moin” in the south. I did pick up on “halt” though without even realizing it. After a year I could make out about half of the thickest Swabian so I count that as a win. 

Baden-Württemberg is one of the most beautiful parts of the country, so don’t hesitate to go there just because of the dialect."

From firsthand experience I can say that being depressed and a student at the same time is one of the hardest things I’ve done. There was also next to no resources at my Uni for students experiencing mental illness. None of the profs were very understanding of it either. It seemed that if you weren’t a neuro-typical, high-achieving student you were just better off leaving the university then. Facing this AND the reality that you have to make some sort of career path with your degree in only 4 years is pretty daunting. I’m a senior now though and have changed my major 4 times so I think it’s perfectly reasonable to not have a clue what you are doing. We are young and still developing our interests and goals.. taking your time is all you can do.."
mentalhealth,fi1mt6b,t3_f5yomf,1582060791.0,"In my own experience, I heard a lot of similar things in my late teens. I would hear screams that sounded like someone was in my face yelling while I tried to sleep. This happened at random and I could never really tell if it was a dream or product of lack of sleep (I didn’t get a lot of rest I should have during high school). I shrugged it off but it did get worse month by month. I started hearing my name everywhere I went like it was being whispered right into my ear. I started hearing people’s conversations in public like they were directed at me almost always making fun of/saying things that related to my personal life. I started having visual hallucinations and realized it was time to tell my doctor. It was really bad by the time I was 18/19. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder at 20 and got the help I needed dealing with these delusions. I can say it’s never really stopped being a part of my life but I know how to deal with it now and live a healthier life.

I’m not giving you a diagnosis, auditory hallucinations could be related to a broad range of things. I’m not trying to scare you either, this could be completely unrelated to schizophrenia type disorders! I would see your doctor asap and include every detail. It would be worth monitoring as it can get very hard to deal with as psychosis progresses. Just make sure you talk about this with someone whether it be a healthcare professional or family member. Hiding it is never good and could feed into delusions/paranoia. 

Just know you ARE NOT a crazy person. Schizophrenia type disorders are highly stigmatized but people live very normal lives with them. Millions of people out there experience the same things in varying intensities, you are not alone! I hope you can find some answers of your own, good luck Op!"

That did not happen. She rushed everything in our “relationship” so it only lasted about a month and some change. I broke it off when she started breaking into my dorm room with her master key (she was the R.A. of my dorm floor). She would wait for me to come back and kind of creepily surprise me when I got back from class or work. She demanded a lot of things from me that I wasn’t ready to do with her. It was all pretty unsettling. She kind of reminded me of that old ‘overly attached girlfriend’ meme.

AskReddit,et4reee,t3_c9ztkc,1562455946.0,"I had a girlfriend in High-School whose family was like this. They were VERY religious and had some... interesting beliefs. 

I once sat down for dinner with them. We prayed before the meal, had nice conversation, and everything seemed normal until I asked about the meat we had been eating. The father explained it was ground venison. Apparently they hunted and cooked up all their own meat. Nothing out of the ordinary - or so I thought. 

That got the father and mother started on a tangent about how the meat industry was disgusting and how the government could “put anything they wanted into your store-bought food at any time”. I asked him what he meant by this and he went on to explain that the government can put micro robots (yes, MICRO ROBOTS) into your food that control your mind. I laughed in this moment because I wanted to believe he was joking about this. 

He wasn’t. Not even slightly.

He explained that it’s the same thing that they do with vaccines and then told me that this is why he never vaccinated any of his 5 children. 

By far the strangest reasoning for being anti-vax that I have ever heard from anyone. I’m surprised that I never saw any of them donning tin-foil hats in the few times I was allowed over to their house. After I learned that my then girlfriend had never been vaccinated for anything in her life, our relationship soon ended. (I was afraid she was going to give me smallpox or something lol) I remember asking her if she thought it was a little weird after dinner and she got pretty offended. Sadly I think she’d been completely brainwashed into believing this by her father."
