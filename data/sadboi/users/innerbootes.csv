Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) is diagnosed when a person matches a list of criteria. 

My personal opinion is that a “narcissist” would be someone with diagnosed NPD. But most people with NPD don’t seek help or a diagnosis. And everyone is an expert these days, so labeling others as narcissists (when they are only exhibiting traits, rather than full-blown NPD) has become really common. 

So there is a lot of conflating the two in everyday conversation, but they are very different things.

You might want to check out YouTuber Dr Ramani. She is a psychologist who covers this topic in great detail and with a respect for accuracy of terms and concepts discussed. (Her target audience is people harmed by narcissism, through. Just a heads up.)

Something I found interesting: she has stated, based on studies, the prevalence of NPD in our society is about 4-6% (if I’m remembering correctly). Whereas the prevalence of narcissistic traits is in around 25% of the population.

Probably getting to the bottom of it would require putting it up against the backdrop of your particular trauma or traumas and how it manifested in your life, then and now. If, for example, your trauma included not having any privacy from your parents, or emotional enmeshment, it might add up. Not sure! A therapist could help untangle it, perhaps.

In the example I gave, the one about being observed, the reason I think of that as introjection is because much of my interaction with my parents as a kid was based on how I looked and behaved, rather than emotional attunement. They showed me affection when I was clean, well dressed, and well behaved. Outside of that, I was mostly ignored. 

So now I carry that need to please others with my appearance and behavior all the time. It has manifested in a few ways. One of the most clear examples is when I’m walking down the street I intensely feel like I’m being closely watched by someone, or a group of someones. It’s very strange.

People who have some knowledge of psychology often already know the term *projection* and this is a corollary of that. 

Just one point of clarification, it’s int**ro**jection, rather than interjection (which is a grammar thing, labeling phrases like *Ah!*, *Oh!*, etc.). 

I reckon most of us here have introjection. A bit more broadly speaking, it can arise when you cannot bond in a healthy way with your parents as a child, so you take on aspects of their personality and their viewpoints in order to create a bond. Sometimes it’s their voice in our heads, but it can manifest in other ways. I often feel as though I’m being watched, even when I’m almost certainly not, and I want to please others when this happens. That’s introjection too. 

Just like with everything else CPTSD, we did it to survive as children and it became so much a part of us we continue it as adults.

botany,fpfha5b,t1_fperrqa,1588571212.0,"Silver variegation — which is what the Hoya pubicalyx ‘Splash’ has — is thought to be an adaptation to low light. It reflects the light within the leaf back to the chloroplasts so they can better photosynthesize with less light. 

To figure out the origins and possible cultivation of a particular Hoya plant’s variegation, I would check with a Hoya society or a grower specializing in Hoyas. 

[There was an episode of Bloom and Grow Radio with botanist Chris Satch](https://bloomandgrowradio.com/variegation101) that delves into the topic of variegation pretty thoroughly if you’re interested. He made the point that variegation isn’t well researched because most plant research is focused on agriculture."
aww,fpdig5w,t1_fpd6wde,1588527619.0,"No, monstera is not “extremely toxic” to cats.

Monstera and other Aroids are mildly toxic. They usually cause vomiting at most, maybe a little mouth irritation. If the cat were to sit and eat an entire large leaf it might start to become an actual issue. Most pet owners know if their cat is one of the very, very few who might actually do that and will take appropriate steps. 

Lilies and palms (among others) are actually extremely toxic to cats, causing severe organ damage from them ingesting a small amount. Those are the ones cat owners need to be watching out for.  

Spreading misinformation is unhelpful because you’re making it more confusing and diverting attention away from true dangers."

COVID19positive,fpaey5e,t1_fpa1haf,1588446765.0,"Right, I forgot to mention that the third possible explanation I was thinking about was just plain stress. Definitely a possibility!

I will be very curious about how this all shakes out.

ETA about the stress connection: I am able to get outdoor exercise during all this. After I felt better in late March, I started running and have been going for short runs (10-15 minutes usually) 2-4 days a week. When I have this acid reflux and I go running, it gets better. I know that exercise can sometimes *bring on* acid reflux so this seems counterintuitive to me. So maybe it is all stress and relieving the stress reduces the reflux.  

Of course, when I came back from my run a couple of days ago, I had what seems to be exercise-induced asthma (bronchoconstriction), coughing for hours. That too is new for me. Is that also from COVID or do I just have that now? So many weird symptoms these days. So confusing."
COVID19positive,fpa0qk8,t3_gbivux,1588438478.0,"I’m here browsing because I have had the worst acid reflux for the past week. It started with burping and now I have pressure, burning, tightness in my throat. 

I have had very occasional mild acid reflux before, but this is awful. 

I am not a COVID patient. I’m one of those people who looks back at an earlier illness and thinks “maybe that was it?” That was in late March. Mild cough, hoarseness, muscle aches, sore throat, headache. At the time it didn’t match the list of COVID symptoms, so I thought it was just a regular cold (albeit completely different from any regular cold I’ve ever had). 

If this continues next week I’ll do a telehealth visit, but I doubt they’ll link it to COVID. The GI connection seems very poorly understood, as far as I can tell. 

I also have had low GI tract issues going into this, so it’s possible this is connected to those. In fact, when it first showed up that’s what I thought it was. But now I really am not sure. Those GI issues have been mostly resolved or resolving in the last six months, so it seems less likely to me."

Most people avoid the concept of true grief, they are deeply uncomfortable with it because there’s no way to sugarcoat grief. 

That’s why people who don’t “get it” give the pat answers they do. They have no concept of the terrible losses many of us have faced, and even glancing at them for a second makes them wince and look away."

That’s not it. 

We wear non-medical masks for others, not for ourselves. We wear N95s to protect ourselves and others. 

Your comment is 100% about how the mask should protect the wearer if used properly, but you don’t even specify which type of mask you’re referring to. If you’re talking about N95s, then say so. But most regular people aren’t even wearing those anyway? So why even focus overly on them? It’s just silliness upon silliness and I can’t even follow what your point is.
