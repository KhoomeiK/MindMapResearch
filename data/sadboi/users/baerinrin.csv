doing with *blank* so that I know what we need to work on.” If they refuse I usually state patient refused. Then I know I at least tried. Or I have also had them at least do pants and socks as that is usually the hardest for patients to do and gives you a pretty good picture of what self cares will be difficult."

OccupationalTherapy,flf5py9,t3_foh04u,1585098636.0,"Brunel University in the UK is the only one outside the U.S accredited by ACOTE. A did a portion of my last clinical there and it’s a great school. Quite a few students from the US. You have to graduate from an accredited school to take the NBCOT. You can validate your international school credits, but it’s an $850 fee. See the link below. I would ensure that the international program meets all the requirements for the validation process before you apply.

OccupationalTherapy,fl291ky,t1_fkwhxq7,1584745653.0,"Nobody is prepared. There isn’t proper PPE and there definitely isn’t enough. This obviously wasn’t expected. I think everyone is well aware of the risk, but like I said previously we can’t just abandon the helpless to suffer and potentially die. If it gets bad enough then yes I agree therapy isn’t probably essential at that point, but for now we have to do what we have to do."
OccupationalTherapy,fl28h9s,t1_fl0fnnp,1584745291.0,If a person with a hip fracture who is non weight bearing lays in bed for two weeks they will get wounds and just get more debilitated. If nursing has to transfer them with a lift that increases burden of care and if things get bad and a facility has to operate with a limited number of nurses the burden of care will be so overwhelming both staff and patients will suffer. Also if we can’t get people discharged to the community we can’t accept new people and free up hospital beds.

OccupationalTherapy,fkvqcyf,t3_fkq4hz,1584574524.0,Our role in SNFs helps keep people flowing through the healthcare system and hopefully discharging to the community. Therefore freeing up space for people to come from hospitals and free up hospital beds for the potential influx of more patients.
Mindfulness,fkd644d,t3_fhgylx,1584069334.0,"I think when people talk about detaching from societal fears they are talking about the Buddhist concept of non-attachment. People attach to the fears in an attempt to control the situation, which causes suffering. To reduce this suffering we must let go and simply be present in the moment because the future hasn’t happened yet and there is no way to control the situation."

AskReddit,fbco60w,t3_ecjmyg,1576728797.0,"Actually just had a weird experience today. First thing I see when I get into the basement is a lion. Yes a lion. A giant taxidermied lion. I turn the corner and I’m greeted by more black eyes staring right at me. Coyotes, deer heads, multiple bears on the floor. Dozens of taxidermied animals (mostly big) just piled on the floor and scattered around the basement. Poor guys :(  I just said to myself “oh my god, where am I right now” as the owners acted like having a hoard of taxidermied animals is normal. 

-taxidermied may not be a real word but you get the gist"
solotravel,f9f2to9,t3_e4qlph,1575258080.0,"Not necessarily a solo trip for pleasure, but I lived in London alone for 3 months for an internship. I got short term accommodation (either Airbnb or similar site). I paid about $1000 dollars per month after exchange rate. I don’t know the cost of living in New Zealand, but I assume London is more or similar. Point being I think you should be fine with $15,000. I suffer from depression and anxiety so I totally get how you feel. My recommendation is to just do it. In my experience you have to just take that leap of faith and look fear in the face. Once you get going you will feel better. You have to remember you can’t plan for everything and that’s okay. Things happen in life wether you are at home or in New Zealand. 

I would also highly recommend mindfulness not only to reduce anxiety, but to fully enjoy your adventure. Good luck! 

p.s. the longer you wait the more scared you will be to go in the future. Do it now"

During this time I was looking up celebrities who had committed suicide (it’s weirdly and ironically comforting to me) and in particular people like Anthony Bourdain, Kate Spade, and Robin Williams really struck me and resonated with me because on the outside they looked “happy” and “normal”. And I feel that I show myself as happy and inside I’m literally dying. I realized that this horrible disease can hit anyone at anytime and that it will always be a part of my life. So I decided I needed to savor and enjoy all the moments I can get when I’m feeling good and not under a black cloud of depression. It’s a work in progress everyday,"
