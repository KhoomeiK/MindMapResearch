One safari was in a actual reserve and there were no fences separating us from the animals in the river next to the lodge. One morning me, my mom, and my sister were walking towards the dining lodge from a little porch when I got a terrible gut feeling, like the ground was shaking, but neither my mom or sister felt it. I lied and said that I needed to get something from the porch so my sister and mom stopped to wait for me on the edge of the porch. Just as I went in two gigantic hippos barreled past right where we would have been and ran into the river to the side."
