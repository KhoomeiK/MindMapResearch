like when one of our friends remembers a detail about our brother or something in our past. and our brother, even though we have never interacted with him, i know how close we were to him based on mc‚Äôs determination. like during the patronus side quest when one of the happy memories we could choose to focus on was jacob coming back from hogwarts his first holiday and trying to teach us everything. i remember that was the only option that didnt require an attribute level which baffled me considering i felt that was the obvious answer

also them giving me the opportunity to be lesbian and go on dates with cute girls ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
