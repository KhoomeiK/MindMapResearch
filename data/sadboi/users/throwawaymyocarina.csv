I feel like I forget how I get while and after I am with them. So thanks for reminding me and reenforcing my feelings. The truth is my mom was an enabler too and it's hard sometimes to think of her as that. I decided I'm going to call her and invite her (and our dog!) To come to my birthday. She probably didn't want to come so she could keep pretending she has a perfect family and also so my stepfather and stepsister don't starve since they are incapable of doing any chores by themselves.

My mom also once pretended my stepfather never beat me, and if I bring it up she always dismisses it. 


You're right, it is my birthday. Bringing our dog to me is the least she could do.
