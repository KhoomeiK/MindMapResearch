This was aimed at the misplaced comments in this section that are  “if only people have this much thought to having kids *eyeroll*” like they do? No one has any idea of the amount of conversations couples go through in their decision to child rear other than the couple itself. It’s just a very broad, condescending statement for child rearing couples as much as “what do you mean you don’t want kids?” Is a condescending statement to non child rearing couples."

Having children involves extreme amounts of change, and many people go into it with as many reasons as why they want to as those with reasons why they don’t.

NarcissisticAbuse,flol6n4,t3_fq32gh,1585340437.0,"I read a couple other of your posts and let me tell you, you’ve done the MAJOR step of self awareness in realizing your ex is a narcissist. And right now it sounds like you’re in the stage of processing it, where you’ll oscillate between, “am i making it up?” Or, “she realizes what she’s done wrong, and communication will fix this”, or, “i know she’s a narc. But i can love her through this”. No one can tell you the outcome, but please just keep reading up on this thread. Continue reading about trauma bonding. Continue lining up red flags to your situation. Continue reading about Hoover and manipulation tactics. 

Trauma bonding is giving you the empathy to “love” your abuser through it, but i can tell you, your situation was just like mine was a year ago, and just like so many others. And each time you break up(they’ll always have backup supply) and get back together(when they lose that supply or start losing their grasp on you), the abuse will get MONUMENTALLY worse. It’s more and more painful each time. Realize you’ll never know the real or whole truth about practically anything they’ve ever told you. The decision is ultimately yours but you’re moving in the healthy direction. 

Also, if you’re able to find any other place to live, do so. Whether that’s putting out a temp living situation feel online, or even a shelter-honestly consider it. You’re getting traumatized by their triangulation."

As far as killing, i think it stems from the same behaviors. The need for justice, revenge, or karmic reactions. I think a lot of times this may go above and beyond our own mortal coil and be more about humanity. Pisces have a tendency to be martyrs."

NarcissisticAbuse,f3ow4uy,t1_f3osd98,1571030894.0,"i appreciate the intentions, but i’d rather not post at all compared to a “things happen for a reason and you are your own worst enemy” rhetoric. sometimes the things that happened to you really should not have and your own worst enemy isn’t yourself. yourself is why you’re still alive after painful shit, your abuser is and can never not be your real enemy. it’s like taking the blame. this is what i think makes me feel so frustrated, because you can write about it and go to therapy but god forbid you talk about it. why can’t we talk about it? why can’t we talk about abuse patterns, when we don’t know who out there needs to know them?😕"
abusiverelationships,f3oqxqw,t3_dhklt4,1571025712.0,they’re just trying to twist the situation into how “inconsiderate you are” so you can feel bad and try and make it up to them. that way you’re the bad guy in the picture. it’s a distraction.

NarcissisticAbuse,f3joe2j,t3_dgx4an,1570955861.0,"google trauma bonding if you haven’t already. basically the pain/pleasure cycle they put you through throws chemicals in your brain all out of wack. this is what it took for me to wake up. you can say everything is “fine”, and undermine your own feelings. but you can’t stop your physical reactions. it causes lots of various symptoms, but one large one is it burns it your capacity to relate to others. having sex after my narc partner felt like Hell, as well as even just having friends. you’re just..burnt out. only one person can give you those physical reactions. it’s why the sex gets better. trauma, trauma bonding, having someone play with your pain receptors is only ever cumulative. that’s why going and staying no contact is the only way to break those bonds. they don’t fade after a few months- they can be picked back up at any time. which is why the sex after a particularly painful period without them is so mind blowing. cycles of the pain/pleasure. over and over until you decide to break it. 


good sex won’t happen until you’re healthy. healthy won’t feel good for a long time after the abuse.  it can take a full year for your body to reset itself,  chems leveling out. take up a sport. have sex with yourself more. don’t let the pain build anymore. at some point you’ll hit your pain threshold and only you know when you can’t take anymore and need to leave. good luck"

NarcissisticAbuse,f2bsqan,t3_dcrve2,1570130559.0," they won’t believe you to be honest. even with definite proof. what i’ve learned is make sure you’re telling them the truth out of morality- if you think they have the right to know and you really want to warn them- as opposed to anger. it makes a difference in the end. they won’t believe you, but slowly the truth will come out on its own. it may take a while, but you can’t rely on it. if you focus on the narcissists’ own downfall you’ll never be happy. if they do fuck up, it’ll be an empty win. focus on yourself and you’re free to be honest with others about your experience, but no doubt you’ll be used in triangulation. way later, the person who thought you were the “crazy ex”, will see things for how they really are. hopefully by then you are long estranged from the entanglement of the narcissists’ life."

i’ve done the healthy part and blocked and also deleted accounts that made me feel like shit. but i still post to instagram because i like the photos i take and documenting, it makes me feel good. i know they have their own way of checking up on me. so sometimes i catch myself making posts that are extra positive in some way just because i know they’ll see it. which also sounds like narcissism. not trying to derail OP’s thoughts, but just a different side of the same coin that i struggle with."

abusiverelationships,f1jmfak,t3_d9lvoq,1569524980.0,i used to feel that way about my abuser. they are really good at using tears to be manipulative. but has anything ever changed after crying and using your empathy against you? has it ever gotten better? you’re so concerned with the emotions of someone else that you’re ignoring your own. that’s a major part of trauma bonding.

LifeAfterNarcissism,esnbd5k,t3_c8gnjf,1562127531.0," yeah... i’ve gotten those texts. multiple times, for the different times of being discarded and then hoovering again. every time i say to myself no more. also every time it seems genuine. a l s o every time it gets MUCH worse than the time before. your call, but it sounds like you feel guilty and like you’re questioning the validity of how you have felt towards her prior to her messaging you. but that’s the whole idea. how you see things is valid and you have to make the best decision for you and not  because an apology means “everything will be different”."

i don’t block to be childish or petty, i block you because at this point your toxic enough in my life that i don’t want any contact from you at all


but also, if it’s a peaceful ending or just an unfollow without feelings, i’ve had old friends get mad at me for unfriending them or unfollowing despite maybe going months without seeing them and them flaking/not responding to texts/ or talking ill of me. 

the point is, do what you gotta do, but if someone really cared they would be more worried if they hurt you then angry you unfollowed them."

self,epurtkv,t3_bvx8sy,1559514815.0,"I had an on/off again relationship for about five years hat was pretty toxic and codependent, which i only discovered through soul searching at points we were apart. For figuring out fhe truth, there were times when i cut off contact here and there. Maybe unfollowing their Snapchat so i can’t see what they were doing, but maintaining text contact every so often. After some healing, we would attempt to fix things, but breaking off contact usually means someone is hurt, and sometimes undoing that hurt is difficult. I no longer speak to this person, it’s been a few months but i have completely cut off contact in every possible way. I deleted all social. I did it for my own security and so i didn’t drive myself crazy with anger at their life. Which is my own problem. Sometimes it’s necessary to get your head straight. Will we talk again? Who knows. But do what feels right. If maintaining contact is repeatedly hurting you, even if it’s your own head, it helps to break away."
relationship_advice,ep1v0ij,t3_btn8fz,1558996745.0,"I’ve never known a person to only cheat once. I think what really sticks out is cheaters are very good liars, and they’re VERY good at talking themselves out of things. They’re smooth. That’s how they can (usually) get away with cheating. It’s very hard to be betrayed by someone that is the center of your world. But also, you deserve peace of mind and commitment. Therapy and couples therapy may help, if you really want to work things out. It could be a neutral meeting point, while you work on yourselves individually and see how it works together. It’ll give you space to process what has happened and your feelings regarding it. Don’t worry about how other people handle this situation in their own personal lives. Saying how “well, my friend’s partner sleeps with other people and he’s okay with it”. You’re telling yourself, “if I’m not okay with this then i am equally a part of losing this marriage”. It’s not on you. It’s not you. You’re feelings are your feelings. Some important questions to think of is, do you think that trust can be repaired? How will you know when she’s telling the truth? Will this lead to more skepticism and “checking up” on the other’s motives and private conversations? How many times a day, if you stay together, will you look at her and remember what she’s done? It builds mistrust and resentment. Please take care of YOURself and YOUR feelings."
