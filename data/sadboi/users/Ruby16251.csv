pregnant,fr1ct45,t3_gm323b,1589817457.0,"There's a subreddit called mentalhealthbabies that I've joined as well. I have bipolar 2 and chose to also stay on my medication. I've had a good pregnancy so far and I just hit 37 weeks. I'm 38 and didn't have any of the health issues you might expect being a bit older. I've been healthy up to pregnancy as well. There's definitely a lot of women who are pregnant and have to take medication. 
Good luck! :)"
pregnant,fqz5xt1,t3_glc6jy,1589760560.0,"Hi there I'm also bipolar,  type 2. I've been taking medication throughout pregnancy which really helped me. I have a horrible time if I don't get sleep! Hopefully you can see your doctor soon and get something figured out! It's really not fun losing sleep!"
MentalHealthBabies,fqrp2xc,t1_fqpy7vm,1589588900.0,That's a good idea. I'll definitely mention these things.
MentalHealthBabies,fqpeuo8,t1_fqpdtz5,1589544538.0,Thanks so much for your response. I also get the overstimulation problem. I find a lot of things will add up to me too and become overwhelming! When this happens I'm irritable and super sensitive to like light and sound.

MentalHealthBabies,fqnquae,t1_fqnqiw3,1589499703.0,That's ok! I probably need to relax my fear around the epidural too. If I need to get it I will. It's probably likely. I just got all anxious over fears of csection. I'm just an overly anxious person at times. Had an online prenatal class tonight which discussed these things and of course I'm scared. üòê

MentalHealthBabies,fqmsj2y,t1_fqmsebl,1589482801.0,This is exactly my thinking. I deal with things really well when I'm not anxious. Anxiety makes me jump at all sorts of simple things. üôÑ
MentalHealthBabies,fqms5mk,t1_fqms16o,1589482625.0,Ok. I'll probably ask as much as I can when I get in there. Thanks!

Yeah I've read a lot about epidurals and I really have no idea how it will go for me. I'd like to avoid it because well I'm nervous about not being able to move around plus I'm just worried it'll impact the progression of labour."
BabyBumps,fpwamt7,t1_fpw9394,1588960114.0,It was annoying for me too. I should have asked for help! I was in the tub and didn't quite feel like I'd get back up again lol!

BabyBumps,fptf09g,t3_gfc7aa,1588890047.0,I drank way less almost none during first trimester but after everything was going well and I started to go into 2nd and now in 3rd trimester I've had a cup of coffee and a tea. A couple of days I had 2 cups of coffee but those are cups I made at home so less caffeine than some take out kinds. I almost had an aversion to coffee even decaf in 1st trimester anyway. Smell of it bothered me!
BabyBumps,fpte0vm,t3_gfdfq1,1588889532.0,Omg I'm 35 + 4 and I cut my toe nails today...it was sooo hard. I don't think that's happening again until after delivery! üòÜ
pregnant,fpehynb,t3_gcrex6,1588547905.0,Not sure but you might want to check about the medication and how much gets in breastmilk. You could pump when there is low concentration? Just in case you wanted to go that route. I just think a lot of people think that it's off the table with medication but that may not neccesarily be the case.
pregnant,fpehol1,t3_gczkem,1588547756.0,I talked to pharmacist about an antihistamine that helped a reaction I had during early pregnancy. I have ezcema too but it was an allergic reaction that happened to me.
MentalHealthBabies,fp5szjo,t1_fp5ri9m,1588339208.0,"Yes, talked to my dr. about it and she was fine with it. 
Thanks!"
MentalHealthBabies,fp3u0vm,t1_fp30em2,1588285790.0,"Yeah, I feel bad enough about having to take medication during my pregnancy. I've done a lot of research, called organizations and of course made sure my doctors were ok with it. If you want to find a correlation between things like how a child develops over a lifespan there are more things to consider than a medication taken during pregnancy that keeps the mother healthy. There's economic status, genetic considerations, age of the mother, whether the father is involved,  so many things to consider. Plus there are silly studies out there trying to show that black licorice causes these things too."
MentalHealthBabies,fp1wv1a,t3_gatd5s,1588250010.0,"I sort of feel like it's not appropriate to post this in this sub...just because it's not very supportive. 
Research is out there that shows little if no effects. Plus I think it would be almost impossible to link these things together. I read that black licorice was linked to adhd.... seriously can't we just post more positive things here?"

Today it just got out of control. I do feel a lot better now though. Hopefully I won't need to take it much again. I'm going to check in with my doctor though to see what she thinks. In the past once I get triggered it seems to stick around for a little bit."
MentalHealthBabies,fowakuu,t1_fow4e7e,1588116088.0,"Thank you,  yeah I feel a lot better now. 
Yeah these things totally don't go away. I'm surprised  I was able to not take it for the past 8 months!"
MentalHealthBabies,fowag1p,t1_fow7rk5,1588116017.0,Thanks yes I feel a lot better now than I did earlier.
MentalHealthBabies,fovnjx4,t1_fovnbib,1588104331.0,"Thank you. I'm just reading stuff now and scaring myself again. I really shouldn't fo that. 
I'll probably feel better when I talk to my dr.
I should relax everything else in pregnancy has been going well and baby is pretty much fully developed now."
MentalHealthBabies,fovk3nf,t1_fovjebu,1588102662.0,"It's actually just .25 I keep getting that confused. I hadn't taken it in a long time since finding out I'm pregnant. 

Yes I get triggered by germs and lack of order and control sometimes. I had an argument with partner/fiance the weekend and it triggered some feelings of a previous abusive relationship. I get really sensitive to like a man raising his voice and getting angry. 

I'm not a complete control freak but when I start to feel like I'm losing control emotionally I really struggle with the lack of control of other things.

It's starting to feel better now. The pill helped. I have less like tension and nervousness.

Thank you for replying! I really needed someone who understands to relate! :)"
MentalHealthBabies,fovhxic,t3_g9tehl,1588101611.0,I guess it just started to feel like I'm losing control....and that in itself is scary. Then I cried. I hate feeling like this. I was doing so well throughout pregnancy.
MentalHealthBabies,fovhpep,t1_fovhdek,1588101502.0,It's .5 of clonazepam which I've read is safer in the third trimester plus she said it would be ok...but I still feel badly. I just feel so trapped and threatened by things. Like even my cats started to feel scary. It's too much today. So I'm just laying in bed letting this pill work.
bipolar2,forobe1,t1_fornmj2,1588015631.0,"Oh ok :)
I've had the diagnosis since my teens.
Then I did a thesis on stigma...which actually really stressed me out! I've also had some bad experiences with people labeling things too much and experienced the negative consequences of things. 
There is also the flip side of no one believing you are ill which is definitely worse!"
bipolar2,formziw,t1_formqr6,1588014972.0,"Oh no worries, I just think we can over react to normal stuff too. Like for me personally I'm sick of everything being categorized. I accept the diagnosis but there's so many people doing random stuff and no one bats an eye!"
bipolar2,formd0e,t3_g92dvp,1588014667.0,If I were not taking medication I think caffeine would trigger hypomanic stuff.
bipolar2,form6b2,t1_forly76,1588014575.0,I guess there's other stuff going on. I tend to take stuff out and organize things. I also laugh a lot...at nothing...so it's pretty obvious I'm not really myself. People tend to be more destructive though I think on the grand scale.
bipolar2,forlt7i,t3_g8zcab,1588014397.0,I don't think I'd call that a hypomanic thing. Sounds like a normal thing that anyone could do. :)

BabyBumps,fmwa191,t3_fxjadz,1586442652.0,"Yeah, I cleaned out the fridge Sunday and it wiped me out. There was a lot of squatting and bending...then I needed a break and I was still achey and tired the next day! I miss being able to exercise too but I'm not going to overdue it either it's just not possible right now at 31 weeks!"
introvert,fmw02ic,t3_fxibd0,1586436245.0,I believe I have both. I was pretty extroverted as a child though and I think around teen years I became more introverted and grew some social anxiety. For me it really depends on the people and the setting. Some people make me uncomfortable and some people I just don't care to talk to...I find very draining and just really don't enjoy it. It really depends on the nature of the interaction. I find I just want to get away from draining self centered types or overly dominant personalities because it's just so draining. There comes some anxiety knowing that I have to almost perform socially in some situations which just makes me feel gross. I know they are definitely different things but they are pretty intertwined for me!
hsp,fmsqbw2,t1_fmsnvxl,1586360288.0,"Yes, exactly! I went through periods where I didn't want medication and went off it. It's been hard for me to get on board with it so I totally understand people not wanting to do it. But coming out of it and feeling more stable and not reactive to everything really is better for me. I definitely think there's gotta be a strong relationship between HSP and mood issues because we feel everything! How can you not react?

But I have a diagnosis and it's been repeatedly diagnosed since I was a teenager. So there's a big difference between that and other things."
hsp,fmspy3r,t1_fmsneex,1586360105.0,"Yeah the professionals definitely know what's best.  I just wanted to explain not to be afraid of trying medication too. But it does have downsides for sure.  It really depends on the person. I just responded because it does suck to go through a difficult time. It could also be a reflection of what is going on in the world right now. Definitely try to look at it all together. For me I don't necessarily need to have something wrong around me to feel off, I can get off track when good things happen, so I know I need medication."
hsp,fmpd0pu,t1_fmpachq,1586278656.0,"Yeah I totally can see where you're coming from. I've definitely had my share of bad experiences with medication and it's not certainly a quick fix or the answer for everyone. For me personally I deal with bipolar disorder and I guess it overlaps with being HSP as well.  I have tried living with the intensity of my emotions and reactions to life and the environment but after being on medication for an extended period of time to allow it to work for me...and finding the right one...I 100% would not be okay off medication. It really depends on the person and everyone has their own choice in the matter. There's so much anti psychiatry voices out there and fear of big pharma... I just wanted to voice my thoughts on it. Medication definitely is not perfect but if someone is suffering I do think it is an option to help.

Edit: I don't feel numb on medication, I don't think that it should do that. Just wanted to make that point.  I definitely still feel and am sensitive but I feel that I'm more functional and sleep better, am happier overall."
hsp,fmp3yf2,t3_fwlwdd,1586273984.0,I'm super sensitive too. Sometimes medication can help with these things. I'm not one to push medication on people but I don't totally think we're built for the way the world is. If I could live in a bubble  I would. Maybe a therapist or psychiatrist would be able to help? Not saying there's something wrong with being HSP but it makes life harder. Like for example if it interferes with sleep or other normal functions of life then it becomes a problem.
pregnant,fmp3gsx,t3_fwl7js,1586273708.0,Congratulations!
bipolar2,fmofuzn,t1_fmngsoh,1586257497.0,"Oh yeah, me and a psychiatrist both thought I was only dealing with depression. I guess I'm speaking for myself in that it's been a desperate attempt for me to not have it. I've been well recently but I've certainly had some difficult times and the stigma is just horrible!"
pregnant,fmn6oht,t1_fmmr5dl,1586219334.0,"Yes, me too. I cleaned the fridge yesterday and it really wore me out for the day!"
bipolar2,fmn2ga7,t3_fw83j3,1586216803.0,A lot of times I feel like that after I've been well for a long period of time. I've gone off medication and it doesn't take long for something to trigger me into an episode. The reason that I've been well to begin with is the medication and I somehow want to blame medication for other things that I can't control or worry about the long term effects of taking medication. But I've had enough experience now to know that I cannot do that to myself again. Stability on medication is far more superior to not taking medication. I think we all don't want to have this disorder and it's a desperation to find ways out of the diagnosis.
pregnant,fmmq3gw,t1_fmmctk3,1586209929.0,"Yeah I've been waking up more too.

I don't think I can be someone who really enjoys bossing around other people. I do at times in my personal life become bossy and more type A but it seems in the long run to be under the radar and be type B at work, works better for me and my life overall. 

Yes money and ambition are great but I'm not sure my overall happiness is worth it. Of course me and my partner make enough money to be support and afford a middle class lifestyle. I'm not overly materialistic and find simple things truly make me happy."
BabyBumps,fmbljxv,t3_fu9hiu,1585928739.0,I think the fact that you're active is really what's important more than the weight. I was a bit bigger than you (same height)  before getting pregnant and I tried to stay fairly active throughout. Now in 3rd trimester and gained about 20lbs. I didn't get GD or have issues with blood pressure or anything else really. I'm also 38 and this is my first pregnancy. So I sort of expected the worst... but I honestly think a moderate amount of exercise is really good at keeping you healthy throughout. But honestly no one really knows what it's going to be like for them and just going with your own gut feeling is best!

Either way my dr. Wants me to avoid SSRIs from now on...and I do too after the effects it had for me. I'm doing well on seroquel alone. I didn't much like abilify  either when I tried it.

bipolar2,flkgkmm,t1_flkg6xo,1585240524.0,Yeah sometimes I have to wonder what I think is side effects versus what is the illness. For example after hypomania there's always a down point and it gets rough till it evens out again.

bipolar2,fl7ne09,t1_fl7la53,1584905346.0,"Yes, well it does cause drowsiness but you do get used to it over time. I'm taking 100mg right now and currently pregnant, 3rd trimester everything has been going very well. From what I understand the antidepressant effects really occur at higher doses. Sleep is the most important thing for bipolar. And mental health in general. So that side effect is probably a good thing. I was only taking 75 mg but had to go up to 100 recently because I was having symptoms of it not keeping me asleep (hypomania). So I increased it with my dr.s knowledge and it went back to normal during the week. I started taking only 25 mg about 2 years ago but it's really been the best medication for me. Plus it's also ok for breastfeeding because the amount that gets into the milk is negligible. Plus I'm planning on pumping when it would also be at the lowest amounts. Women take much higher doses throughout pregnancy as well."
bipolar2,fl769t9,t3_fn1hzr,1584895173.0,Any thoughts on just increasing the quetiapine? I take it on it's own for bipolar and it helps with depression as well. I've taken lithium before in the past as well as valporate. Given that I wanted to get pregnant quetiapine was the better choice but I also thought that the side effects were better on the long term for the body. Lithium was very good for me but I worry too much about the impact on kidneys long term.
