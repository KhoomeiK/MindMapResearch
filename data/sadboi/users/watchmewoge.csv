depression,fgembmd,t3_ey0iqy,1580703118.0,"Hey there,

In my experience sometimes it can help sometimes it doesnt ive been with my husband for 12 years we both have depression and sometimes we aren't great at helping each other. I know sometimes I feel as if im bothering him or my mood swings cause him to hate me sometimes being in a relationship isnt the best thing when you feel depressed and other times it can be really great if you feel they can comfort you but its hard being the spouse of someone who is depressed as you end up being relied on heavily and it takes a huge toll on the other person because they have to manage your stability and theirs you know? Its not as easy as just being better or just not being depressed its hard and exhausting.

Focus on you and your mental health and care for yourself in the end you could be let down by someone else and it causes resentment and even more depression make sure you can hold your self up more than relying on someone else to know how hurt and sad you are feeling and maybe try to put it into a hobby? Either way I hope you get better in rooting for you and your happiness‚ù§"
