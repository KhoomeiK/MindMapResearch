My parents smoked indoors til I was about 8/9 and kids were starting to understand I smelled like smoke. My dad went outside to smoke immediately after I asked them to stop. My mother, who was mentally unstable but still sort of functioning-ish, but also didn’t work, would smoke out the windows when I was home and inside when I wasn’t home. I’d constantly break and wet the cigarettes and hide them. This shit made me hate her so much. She just became someone I lived with and didn’t understand why I wouldn’t talk to her. I grew up on my own even though she was physically present. started doing all my own laundry in middle school, buying groceries on my own and working at 16, and so much more. College time came around but I commuted, still ignored her. I refused her coming to my college graduation. There are other issues that contributed to my anger towards her but her picking cigarettes over me really just tipped the scale. I moved in with my grandma at 21 after grandpa died. Moved out on my own about a year ago on my 24th birthday, 2000 miles away and I’m so glad to be far. My health in 20s has now declined a lot and I have severe stomach issues and I blame the cigarettes because I do not drink, smoke, etc- did nothing wrong. I eat fairly healthier now but the problems are just unable to be resolved. And now she gets to find out soon she will not be involved in my wedding at all- no advice wanted from her, and she will not be invited to anything. I didn’t even personally call her to tell her about my engagement. I gave my sister the ok to tell her if she wanted but I had no plans to talk to her directly. I ignore her messages and calls.

Fourth: Reduce mixer speed and add half the flour, then add heavy cream, then remainder of flour. -Keep mixing for 5 more minutes. 

Fifth: Grease & flour pan HEAVILY. Pour mixture into pan. 

***Then place in COLD oven, DO NOT PREHEAT!!!! ***

weddingplanning,foh4i1c,t3_g7dayo,1587760439.0,I got engaged two weeks ago and am planning for oct 2021. I’m doing a virtual tour on Monday with my preferred venue I’ve narrowed to (also I’m 2000 miles from where I’m moving back to/where my wedding will be so can’t tour I’m person til this fall anyways). I want to atleast book venue (which my top two have food in house) and then I will do other vendors when I move back in this September. But venue date was very important to me that’s why I’m starting now. Congrats and good luck :)
