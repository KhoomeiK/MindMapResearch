AskReddit,fb1f143,t3_eauhhu,1576435976.0,"My older sister have been mentally ill ( schizophrenia / paranoia/ psychosis) since 10 years ago..... It broke both my parents really.... We couldn't get her admitted back then because mother won't allow admitting her by force.... Too heavy on her to witness that.... I started  suffering mild depression around that period.... It was a daily loop.... Few years later I got a decent job, made really good money then I got fired because I gotten into an argument with my boss.... Around that time I fell into a really deep depression state... It was a new experience to me.... I didn't even know at all that I had depression.... That comes later.... My girlfriend at that time helped me alot with getting a new job... A while after I got a decent job because of her.... She made all the calls and the connections, I studied really hard and passed the interviews.... I was really happy but i was skeptical at that point of my abilities.... I don't want to be fired again or be bad at my job.... Unfortunately i get the biggest hit of my life 2 months into the new job..... My dad had a brain stroke... Got into a coma.... And my family wouldn't let me know.... Kept it a secret.... I knew something was wrong from calling my mother.... My dad was never there and I used to call him a lot... We were really close.... My mother broke finally two weeks later and told me..... I was totally crushed.... My depression got so bad that I couldn't pick myself up off bed in the morning.... I couldn't shower.... I couldn't eat.... Too stressed and too sad.... I am far away from home and making arrangements to go see my dad in the nearest possible time.... I thought life couldn't get any worse.... But it did.... My girlfriend leaves me for another guy in the midst of all this.... Calling out the things i would do during that period.... And even at that point.... Deep rock bottom point.... I didn't realize i was suffering depression..... I was honestly contemplating suicide when my gf left me.... I called my best friend who lives near me to spend some days with him..... I told him everything about my problems and thats when he opened my eyes to how fucked up I am.... To how I am really depressed.... I checked the depression subreddit later around that time and was amazed that I had the same exact symptoms, the same problems, and even much worse.... My best friend suffered from that too in the past and got therapy and was on several medications.... It really made a difference knowing what it is going on my mind.... Diagnosing at least my behavior and thinking patterns..... I didn't get therapy at all.... What I did next was got subscribed to a gym and committing to everyday workout.... Fixed a whole lot of problems i have been dealing with.... I am forced to shower....i eat much more because of the exercise.... I sleep better because i tire myself everyday.... I am getting leaner and more confident each day.... I accepted all my problems.... I realized I am not in a situation where I can run away from all what's happening.... I can't leave my mother who has been carrying an enormous weight for more than a year now.... My dad thankfuly got out of coma.... But unfortunately he has early stages of alzhimers and left side paralyzed.... I worked from home a couple of months this year....managed to help my mom with a lot of financial problems.... Problems with home.... Getting nurses to assist my dad in daliy life.... Got my sister forcefully admitted to a hospital and get her treatment..... There is a lot of horrible days and stuff i couldn't mention that has happened.... I am trying now to focus on studying.... To pick my work skills back up.... Prove myself again.... It's a really messy situation.... I have my bad days as we will do..... Only my best friend knows the whole story.... Many people know that my father sick.... But I guess I have to keep all things together hidden..... This will always my battle that no one knows about"
depression,f1ho3fz,t1_f1gsud4,1569497591.0,This one really hurt.... I relate so much to that... Actually losing that specific person made me realize that I have depression to begin with... One of my main goals towards fighting depression is finding a person like this again
depression,ewo059t,t1_ewn9ywi,1565599095.0,Omg.... I have been doing this since as far as I can remember to the point where I can no longer act as myself.... It does make you popular.... It just has no relation at all to who you really are
depression,ew7bn2d,t3_cmwrhq,1565189274.0,"Describes my day perfectly, except that sometimes I even don't have enough energy to go to work in the first place and just pretend to be sick or tired and try to work from home."

depression,eu7ysyn,t1_eu7yakm,1563546035.0,"I am sorry you're going through this as well.... It seems pretty difficult working our way through these thoughts and will definitely take a lot 
Of time.... It's now really getting to my ability to work and study and that's what I am worried about the most currently"
depression,eu7xwkw,t1_eu7xrvp,1563545461.0,"All the time yeah... I am always distracting myself by going to the gym, doing chores, talking to friends.... But when I am alone it just takes over"
depression,eu7xi47,t1_eu7wuxg,1563545203.0,I believe I am in the same situation.... All the time I am thinking about specific conversations and actions I should have taken.... I keep telling myself this will just take some time.... But honestly I am just tired.... Like mentally drained at this point
depression,eu4p2cj,t3_cehzdy,1563459870.0,This post perfectly sums up everything for me really.....life in this era is just pure bullshit
depression,ets5kml,t1_etfr56v,1563137072.0,It did help yeah.... But my main issue here is not being in control of my emotions to the point where i really thought i turned emotionless
depression,ets5i3c,t1_etfo0ac,1563137022.0,That's what I keep telling myself too... That maybe time will heal these wounds.... Let's hope it works
depression,ets5fzz,t1_etfzjmc,1563136982.0,Yeah I what bugs me the most is that the depression is the one in control here
