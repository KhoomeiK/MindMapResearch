Sahih Al-Bukhari – Book 71 Hadith 670



Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “He who commits suicide by throttling shall keep on throttling himself in the Hell Fire (forever) and he who commits suicide by stabbing himself shall keep on stabbing himself in the Hell-Fire.”

Guinho's method for teaching powermoves is really effective since they involve microsteps and microsteps are the key for learning any movement.

then after u master windmills u can start with Flares, i will send u some tutos(those tutos aren't like 99% of tutos on YT)

https://youtu.be/RgEHPTR3RPo
https://youtu.be/hyX0sRE4_XA
https://youtu.be/cl3Ew3DAalY
https://youtu.be/CoJ3e5KFP6Q

very very effective microsteps and drills..... all what u need to learn Flares. after u learn flares and wants to take it to the next level use ankle weights on your feet(but please be careful, its very risky but its the most effective way for mastering powermoves, i used to push Flares to hard while using ankle weights now my adductors hurts like hell)

also i advice you to work on 3 things while learning powermoves
1.Strength
2.Flexibility
3.Technique

example 30% of your time on flexibility, 30% on strength and 40% on practicing technique. just try to balance all those 3.

also dont rush, powermoves takes a long time to learn, u can't get them in 1-2 weeks, even if u practice like 24h a day."
