CPTSD,fonvppl,t1_fonpme2,1587927399.0,"They do. And I would guess that the denial that female abusers exist, that's it's just a 'male problem', makes survivors of abuse by women feel very invalidated."

traumatoolbox,f72n3pa,t3_drl9ue,1573369703.0,I've had the same thing. Are you in a place where cannabis is legal? I've found it helps a lot with the nightmares.
TalkTherapy,f6hsdq9,t3_drdzkp,1572863975.0,"Sorry this is a personal question but do you have any previous trauma that you've not been able to work through yet? SSRIs and CBT didn't work well for me either because they're not necessarily the best treatments for trauma (no fault of my doctors, I never told them about my trauma)."
CPTSD,f6hrlhv,t1_f6hl0q0,1572863452.0,"I agree. No child should be forced into any kind of elective procedure (I include piercings in that too).

To be honest the other poster lost me when they flippantly referred to torture as the ""sub-Saharan scrape and screw"" while also stating that most guys don't even care that they were circumcised as a baby. I can't imagine there are any FGM victims who don't care about what happened to them."
CPTSD,f6hjs1f,t1_f6hi2sn,1572851666.0,"Couldn't agree with you more. The two things are not even remotely comparable. I understand that some males who have been circumsised may have been traumatised by it and they deserve support too. But you don't heal yourself by diminishing other people's suffering. And make no mistake, victims of FGM will suffer.

FGM has no medical benefits, and as you say is likely to pretty much eliminate a women's sexual pleasure. It's done for cruel, misogynistic reasons, no for any health or hygiene benefit. To put it bluntly, some men CHOOSE circumcision. No woman would EVER choose FGM.

Here's some actual, peer reviewed evidence to back this up. There's lots more out there.

And your username is great BTW."

ptsd,f57z9ga,t1_f57tvos,1572045844.0,"This. Unfortunately the word meaning of ""triggered"" in the true mental health sense now seems to have been completely lost. Most people now use it to mean something that made someone feel a bit upset or unpleasant, which very much minimises how being triggered actually feels when you've got people using the word so loosely."
