CasualConversation,fkw9vb9,t3_fl2hew,1584586898.0,"Not to be insensitive or pry, but there could be something additional to your aunt‚Äôs story that you don‚Äôt know about. Not saying this happened, but she could have experienced some sort of emotional/physical abuse that she‚Äôs internalized to this day, which could explain why she has no interest in ‚Äúpitching in.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know your family‚Äôs dynamic at all, and even then, neither of us knows your aunt‚Äôs personal experience, so it would be impossible to say.

Alternatively, she could also be self-centered and not realize that she could/should be helping out. In that case, it could help if your dad mentioned it directly to her to get her response.

Last thought, her current state of wealth could be completely different than what you think it is. Have you actually seen the numbers in her bank account? She could have bought up things when she had money, but is now very low on money, is close to bankruptcy & has to learn how to live more simply.

All possibilities that you can‚Äôt really know without speaking with her on the subject."

bipolar,f3yg5yx,t3_dipbtc,1571253493.0,"BP2 here, and I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for 6+ years, with Abilify for the past 3+, and I‚Äôve found that they make me the most baseline I‚Äôve ever been. But for some reason I‚Äôve been sleeping wayyyy too much. As in, 10+ hours a night, but I still feel so groggy and tired the next day. It kind of makes me miss my more hypomanic days where I could get less sleep but still function. Not really sure what to do about it anymore. I‚Äôm fortunate in the sense that I currently work remotely & as an independent contractor, but when I do have assignments, it really gets in the way of completing my work."

confession,f33vra6,t1_f33vavi,1570646157.0,"Perhaps? Maybe they realized how gross and potentially dangerous it is, so they chose a different means of sharing Christ‚Äôs blood. It‚Äôs traditionally shared out of the same cup, though.

My family had a weird mix of religions growing up, so I‚Äôve been to a lot of different church services. I know at the Adventist Church I used to attend, they had tiny little cups (kinda like mini shot glasses lol) that they passed out during communion. But at every Mass I‚Äôve been to, it‚Äôs always been the same cup for everyone."

confession,f33ukwr,t1_f33u2n7,1570645412.0,"Yeah, I‚Äôm agnostic myself, but have been to plenty a Catholic Mass. At Mass everyone will go up to the front where the priest either gives you bread and wine or gives you a ‚Äúblessing‚Äù if you either haven‚Äôt had a confirmation or aren‚Äôt of the faith. 

Not kidding when I say this, they give one person a sip, they wipe the chalice with a cloth, they switch sides and give the next person a sip, and so on. It‚Äôs not the most hygienic, so it‚Äôs basically on the honor system for anyone who might have a communicable illness."
podcasts,f2xynws,t3_dept6s,1570484074.0,"My suggestions:

Not sure if financial news is what you‚Äôre looking for, but Snacks Daily is a fantastic podcast sponsored by Robinhood (an investment app). The hosts are two 30 somethings named Nick & Jack, and they cover happenings in finance and how those occurrences could potentially impact stocks and the market overall, but in a super digestible and (IMO) pretty hilarious way. The segments range from 13-18ish minutes, and are available on a lot of platforms (personally, I use Spotify).

Also, take a look at the app Overcast. It has tons of podcasts channels to sift through to see which ones you like. I listen to TED Talks Daily, Revisionist History, TED Radio Hour, and Stuff You Should Know, but they have a ton of other options, too. 

Hope that helps!"

It‚Äôs a sensitive subject, obviously, and you don‚Äôt want to make it sound like you‚Äôre just berating her. I can understand how it would feel like a 2v1 attack, but if you and your friend are both coming from a genuine place of wanting to help improve the situation & advise her as friends, then I think it can be enlightening and very beneficial.

I really do think it could help. If it doesn‚Äôt give her a wake up call, then at the very least you both will know that you did what you could to better the situation, you know? After that it‚Äôs really all on this individual to change her behavior."
