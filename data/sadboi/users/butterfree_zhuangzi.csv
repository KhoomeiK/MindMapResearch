This isn't a modern example per se, but many people practice Confucianism to this day and this is the kind of ethics described within this school of thought. I was taught about Confucian philosophy as well as Confucian mysticism. Even in Daoism, a direct response to Confucianism with very different ideas, has it's ethics based in this ritual when looking at it as a philosophical school of thought instead of a mystical religion.

In evolutionary biology this ritual is called reciprocal altruism, when an organism sacrifices it's own fitness to help another organisms fitness. In many fields such as anthropology, sociology, and psychology there are arguments for and against whether altruism is truly possible or if people do things for others out of subconscious self interest. An argument in psychology that altruism is not possible is the social exchange theory and an argument that altruism is possible is the empathy-altruism hypothesis. Then the bystander effect has to be taken into consideration. 

ETA the professor who taught me this interpretation of these schools of thought is a big fan of Nietzsche's criticism of religion and morality. I don't know much about it myself, but I can only assume he had an influence on their outlook."

I did sex work for a short while when I was a libfem. I'm not proud of this by any means, it does however give me a sort of insiders perspective in some ways. The men who came to me always felt the need to explain why they were cheating on their wives. They felt justified in their behavior because their wives were either sick or only wanted sex once a week or some other weak excuse. It was always on the wife though. 

Once I even had a man say he should have started looking for a wife earlier essentially letting me know he had settled. None of them were good in bed yet married for years and kissed like fish out of water. All of this seemed like a them problem, not the wives.  

As much as I hate that I participated in that, it really made me aware of the audacity of men. Now that I no longer do sex work and follow FDS I look back at that and cringe but also see lessons that I couldn't ignore if I tried. I have more respect for myself and other women now.

My ex would get reasonably jealous and try to explain to me what men are like and their intentions, but I was so convinced that this guy was actually my best friend that I wouldn't listen. 

Turned out the ex was totally right and not only was this guy enjoying my free emotional labor but also wanted to be with me sexually and romantically. I even gave the ""bestie"" a chance when I was single again (such poor judgement) and when I decided it didn't feel right he flipped out and stopped talking to me. I still can't believe how brainwashed I was that I couldn't see what my ex was talking about. 

My ex had HVM traits, but was still an on again off again kind of guy in our relationship so I shouldnt feel butthurt that I didn't realize this stuff then, but damn sometimes I wonder what things would have been like if I thought like I do now while I was with him.

One idea from Daoism is that language creates most, if not all, conflicts. The idea isn't that language isn't useful, but that it can be dangerous due to misunderstandings, specialist jargon, a lack of perspective etc."

""The fish trap exists because of the fish. Once you've gotten the fish you can forget the trap. The rabbit snare exists because of the rabbit. Once you've gotten the rabbit, you can forget the snare. Words exist because of meaning. Once you've gotten the meaning, you can forget the words. Where can I find a man who has forgotten words so I can talk with him?"" 
-Zhuangzi 

I only know a select few men who can keep up with me in a face to face conversation because I'm a deep thinker who can see many perspectives at once and it overwhelms even myself. Often I'm told by men that I give off a ""sexy librarian vibe"" when I try to discuss anything academic as if that's a compliment. I give up trying to speak to them then because of the lack of respect for me as well as their inability to even try to listen or respond to what I'm saying. It's silly these men think women are incapable of critical thinking."

I wear a mask because I'm high risk as well as my parents whom I live with, people seem to keep their distance more so when I wear it, and if someone coughs I'm less likely to inhale anything. If someone is asymptomatic they will cough into their mask instead of spreading it to anyone else. 

In places such as Hong Kong and Taiwan where there have been relatively low cases despite the close proximity to mainland China the majority of the population has been wearing masks. I understand these places have taken other measures to prevent spreading the virus, but wearing masks was one of the first. I believe Taiwan even tried it's best to make sure every citizen had one by making the production of them a top priority."
