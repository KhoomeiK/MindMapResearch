depression,ewqhr59,t3_cpidz8,1565666325.0,"I had a literature teaches who once told us we are constantly looking for that place which brings us safety, love and comfort. He called it the lost paradise, because he thought it came from the story of Adan and Eve. When they were forced to leave paradise, human kind has been ever since trying to find that place again. You could also look at it from the perspective of once you get out the uterus (I know it sounds weird üòÇ) but the uterus is for us a safe, comfortable, living place where everything is given to us and once you are born you are exposed to noise, discomfort and everyday problematics."

It takes a lot of courage and it must have been hard. What I wanna say is don‚Äôt give up just yet in both relationships and friendships. I‚Äôm sure there will be one girl who will feel lucky to have you. And good friends take a lifetime to find, keep looking, have hope, there will be someone who accepts you just the way you are. I have found that the friendships which make me feel less lonely are the ones in which I‚Äôm the most vulnerable. In which they know about my past, not everything of course, my insecurities and my present. They took time to find and you need to invest time and interest in them but it was worth the wait because right now I couldn‚Äôt  be more grateful. Don‚Äôt stop being yourself, even if it seems it‚Äôs not working, I swear it will ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

Sometimes at school I would feel really really lonely even though I was surrounded by ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù I think the key not to feel lonely is to make valuable connections with other people by opening your self up and being vulnerable. These type of connections stop me from feeling lonely

AskReddit,es2i3j8,t1_es2hiuu,1561525168.0,That sounds really cool. This is really random but she reminds me of one character called Beppo from the book Momo.

There‚Äôs this therapeutic technique where you talk about your feelings to an empty chair. May sound stupid but may help you get everything out. I don‚Äôt know what else to tell you but to be hopeful and take each day at a time.

MentalHealthSupport,es29i1z,t3_c5ichz,1561517549.0,"Hi sweetie. First of all I want to tell you that everything will be alright. I know you‚Äôre probably imagining the worst case scenarios in your head. Try separating the anxiety from you, as if it wasn‚Äôt part of you. That has really helped me. It takes power from it. That way you know when your thoughts are truly yours or coming from the anxiety. As they‚Äôve told you above, breathing really helps. Try doing mindfulness exercises each morning like paying attention to your breathing, staring with full attention to an object and drawing it with every detail or describing it, you could also do a guided meditation of a body scan. Imagine the best rather than the worst. You‚Äôve got this!!!! Look at everything you‚Äôve been through, I‚Äôm sure you can deal with this too :) Xxxx"
