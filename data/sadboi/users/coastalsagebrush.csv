I'm not saying he killed her or anything but I'm finding it weird that he has her whole wardrobe and her jewelry (my jewelry is the first thing I packed when I had a wildfire near me recently and was close to the evac zone). It seems really odd that she never came back for any of it. This would be more understandable (to me atleast) if she had died after their break up because that would explain why he doesn't want to get rid of her stuff. Being that obsessed with an ex who is still alive and while dating someone else is def a red flag. I wouldn't risk throwing anything out though because you don't know how he'd react.

I come from a family where we don't give each other gifts for anything but my girlfriend does. While my family doesn't like giving gifts, I show people I care for them by giving or making them gifts. I love being thoughtful and I love giving my gf gifts for birthdays and anniversaries and just because days. My gf's family are big on gifts but in a more demanding way ie they give each other lists of things they want for birthdays and holidays. I've always been able to get my gf thoughtful gifts that she loves but she never knows what to get me so I ended up making lists for her even though I feel awkward asking for things like that.

I actually like the long and narrow pages and I've gotten into drawing across the the whole thing rather than just the front pages which I wasn't used to doing. To test it out, you could always fold and cut some cheap paper into the standard size, staple a little booklet, and play around with it.

Edit: just noticed that you said you already got a TN so instead of making that booklet just sketch around in it and see how you like it. If you find it too restricting,  just go back to an A5 and use the TN for other things. You can also watch YouTube vids of people watercoloring in them to see how other people go about it"
