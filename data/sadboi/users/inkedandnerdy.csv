mizzou,fpka8m8,t3_gdp3cu,1588690961.0,"I chose Mizzou and still live in Columbia after graduating four years ago because I love this town. 

I’m from northern IL (basically Wisconsin border) and was looking at all in state schools otherwise. Mizzou was definitely the college that made me feel at home right from the start. U of I and other state schools really didn’t try to give you that home feeling like Mizzou does. Then the private schools like Northwestern were just stuck up in my opinion (although they’ve earned that I guess.) 

The town has tons of things to do other than get drunk all the time, but there’s definitely parties to find when that’s what you want to do. 

Most if not all of the major programs are really solid and will give you the education you need. 

I think the hardest part of being from a town that doesn’t have a lot of Mizzou grads is unless you plan on moving to KC or STL you will not live in the same town as the friends you make in college. A lot of Mizzou students are from those cities and go right back after they graduate. Whereas if you stay at a college close to home, then your college friends will likely still be close by after college which is a perk."
