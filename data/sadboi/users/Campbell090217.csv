femalehairadvice,fr5ybbj,t1_fr5wfcj,1589916703.0,Ok interesting. So same ratio of powder to developer and then a squirt of the clarifying shampoo? How much can it lighten your hair? My hair lifts very quickly so something like that sounds appealing for lifting a shade or two.
femalehairadvice,fr5pvth,t1_fr5nr27,1589912658.0,"Oh got it. I don’t have personal experience I just figured if purple works for yellow it would work for red but yeah that doesn’t make sense lol. Not the opposite color. 

And I did not know that about color oops! Is it better to try that before bleaching or skip it all together?"
femalehairadvice,fr5ioxk,t3_gm3sbt,1589909198.0,You could buy purple hair dye and white shampoo and make a little mix lol. That would be assuming the drugstore had some purple hair dye 🤷🏼‍♀️

femalehairadvice,fr5hvqd,t3_gmssap,1589908824.0,"Hey! You can buy purple shampoo and Sally’s or a drug store. Let it sit on the hair for 5 minutes. That should help. 

The other thing you could pick up is Oops color remover, it won’t bleach the hair, it just helps strip the red."

DuggarsSnark,fr4mpz5,t3_gmnem7,1589892347.0,I completely agree with everything you said. Those kids were/are forced to participate in two cults: IBLP and their family. And yet we are rewarding them by making them celebrities. The kids have been told their whole life that their way of living is morally superior. How will they ever move past that? I don’t think they can.

entwives,fr38lll,t1_fr37fe3,1589852151.0,😂😂😂 I have absolutely done very similar things in the shower. My classic high mistake will be doing a huge pump of conditioner when I mean to do shampoo and then get sad because I don’t want to waste the conditioner. So then I do a pre-wash condition Lolol.

craftymighty,fr1ifnt,t1_fr1i5gd,1589820280.0,No I actually dust it in kief so the oil is covered and then put the lid on. However I don’t use a mesh filter. The capsule lids are enough of a filter for me 😊

femalehairadvice,fqy7se4,t3_gll29f,1589744052.0,"Hey! I would highly recommend a pull through highlight cap with bleach. They sell them in kits at the drugstore but basically it’s a plastic hood you put on with a ton of little holes in it. You use small crochet hooks to pull small pieces of hair through the holes. Once you have enough hair pulled through, apply the bleach and wrap in plastic wrap. Leave it on for as long as it takes for your hair to develop. My hair sounds similar to yours and it bleached very very quickly. I would only do 20-30 minutes for your first time at home. 

Then you just rinse and condition and you will be good to go! I highly recommend having a purple/silver shampoo on hand for toning any brassiness in the hair. 

I did this to myself/had a friend help me for years and got compliments on how natural my highlights look all the time. 

I’m sure there are tons of videos showing you good techniques for doing it yourself. Good luck!"
LaBrantFamSnark,fqx4lct,t1_fqx3j3b,1589725671.0,Exactly. I feel like she has no life behind her eyes sometimes.

CPTSD,fqwwwq2,t3_gl52t5,1589720064.0,"I am so sorry you’re going through this. I have gone through a lot of similar realizations and it’s never easy. As an adult I am only now coming to terms with how much the adults in my life failed me as a child. 

My sister was chronically ill and I was already getting limited attention and care because my parents had to give her all of their energy. But that isn’t what made me mad. What makes me mad is during this time in our life, my dad offered to provide shelter and care for one of his clients (he worked in addiction counseling). So my parents brought in an additional person (a heroine addict who was a stranger to us at the time) to care for during a time that I was desperately in need of their love and attention. 

I will never get over this. They really pissed me off for doing this and for allowing their hero complex needs to be stronger than their need to parent their child."

bostontrees,fqti05y,t3_gkv7sj,1589639388.0,"Hey! So I buy from CommCan weekly lol and I only use full spectrum pax pods or 510 cartridges. Usually a distillate will have high THC percentages (80-90) with low or zero CBD. Full spectrum tends to be around 50-60 THC and usually some CBD like 20-40. But the best thing to do is just call and ask if you are purchasing from somewhere that doesn’t specify. 

I personally hate distillate because it gives me a headache and every budtender I’ve explained that to has understood what I meant and has helped me make sure I always buy full spectrum."

craftymighty,fqjti6r,t1_fqjn13n,1589414972.0,Of course! Everything I know about weed I learned from other friendly ENTs on reddit ☺️ also concentrates are overwhelming and confusing when you are new to it lol. So many weird names and textures and colors.
craftymighty,fqjns7x,t1_fqiil1m,1589412593.0,Nope I put the lid on and always use it with the lid upright. And the caps work perfectly fine no matter what condition they are in. There was a time when I was vaping a lot of the reclaim from my cooling unit and I mixed it with flower and I basically glued the lids on because it was so sticky lol. So I had to start getting some leverage by using a tool to dent the circle and make it easier to pop the lid off.
craftymighty,fqjnd9k,t1_fqi3gsy,1589412424.0,"I don’t have too many issues with keeping it clean as I take it apart and scrape it fairly often. I don’t even use a mesh screen these days. Just dosing capsules seem to be enough of a filter. 

Every month I heat up some olive or coconut oil in the microwave and submerge the pieces of the cooling unit for a few minute until everything has melted off. Then I just rinse the parts making sure to lather them with dish soap to remove any oily feeling. Keeps the CU nice and clean and you can eat the oil after."
craftymighty,fqjmsib,t1_fqi749y,1589412182.0,"Exactly. I love a good mid-texture concentrate. Sugar, budder, live resin, etc. I kinda hate shatter and I wouldn’t use oil like this except it is the only form of concentrate that the dispensary closest to me carries so I have a few syringes to use up."
craftymighty,fqjmhlr,t1_fqhtv04,1589412058.0,No not difficult but can be temperamental. This oil comes in a glass syringe so all I have to do is warm it up a little to get it flowing. The tricky part is if the oil gets too warm it come out too fast and be a mess.
craftymighty,fqjm9z5,t1_fqhn4tb,1589411972.0,I do use my reclaim from the cooling unit if I’m dankrupt or if it is overflowing. This happened to be a full spectrum dab oil that comes in a glass syringe.

mentalhealth,fqacpar,t1_fq9ur7z,1589216822.0,"Just to clarify what the other poster said, this form is coping is not called EMDR. EMDR is a medical treatment done by a licensed professional. It uses techniques to move your eyes rapidly in a way that helps uncover buried memories or traumas. It is most commonly used for people who are “stuck” on certain events/triggers/etc.

What your friend does is a form of dissociation and depersonalization. It’s a technique that we (all humans) use to protect ourself when in harms way for an extended period of time. 

It can be both a good and bad technique, and is one of the less harmful methods. But making sure real life responsibilities are taking care of is usually the issue people run into. Escapism is easy. Facing reality is not."

That being said, I wouldn’t post anything without mod approval and I don’t want to speak for the sub if we are against “defending” ourselves. I just feel so passionately about our cause for very legitimate reasons and maybe having those bullet pointed could help some of the white knights understand and maybe even begin to agree with us.

whatsbotheringyou,fo6i0cy,t3_g5w4lx,1587559304.0,"The best advice I can give you is REHEARSE EVERYTHING!!! Write down as many different talking points that highlight your best work qualities/things you would want an employer to know. Next, take that list and go through it one by one. I want you to write down exactly what you would say. It could be a sentence or a paragraph, it doesn’t matter. The important thing is to come up with super clear language that is detailed but not cocky or rambly. 

From there, write your “script”. Think through the natural flow of questions and write your answers out in that basic order. For example:

1. Tell us about your last job and why you left. 
2. What makes you want to work with us (research the fucking company, read their whole website and google them for any recent news articles)?
3. Can you give us an example of a time you overcame conflict at work?
And so on...

Again, you can google “common interview questions” so you can have more ideas and things to prepare for. 

ALWAYS BE PREPARED TO ANSWER: “what are your three worst qualities at work?” (Or a variation of that question). 

To summarize, over prepare for maximum confidence. I promise you won’t come across scripted because these are real answers in your own words. You simply gave yourself the advantage of thinking them through ahead of time in order to communicate most effectively. 

I hope this helps 😊 I got my dream job by using these techniques."

trees,fnsl2uo,t3_g3p8vp,1587223823.0,"You will probably get the same advice from everyone but go small and slow!! Edibles are completely unpredictable unless you have consistently taken precise doses and know what works for you. 

Eat a part of the edible and wait and hour. If you feel nothing, eat another small bite. At hour 2 you should start to feel it if you haven’t already. I would not eat anymore unless it is hour 3 and you still feel nothing.  Be patient and enjoy the experience."
relationships,fnskf9o,t1_fnshusx,1587223448.0,"Yeah it’s going to be one of those rip-the-bandaid off situations. Just be straight with her and it may be awkward for a minute but you will feel relieved and life will go on. She has endless options for virtual exercise in this day and age. 

And if you do want to continue to help, offer to do one paid 30-60 minute workout a week."
relationships,fnsht7n,t3_g3mbjc,1587221909.0,"Is this a paid arrangement or something you asked/offered to do? I’m very confused because if she asked you to give her free classes, you have every right to stop at any time, no explanation needed. Just tell her you are done. 
Even if she is paying, you can stop at anytime (assuming she hasn’t prepaid/contracted you). If you want to maintain a friendship with her, she should be understanding and not give you any problems. If she is somehow offended, I highly recommend rethinking the friendship."
DunderMifflin,fns9czn,t1_fns87pj,1587216356.0,"Ok understandable. I’ve been watching it for like 10 years so I’m used to it all lol. But the guy you are referring to, Robert California, is one of my favorite characters. 

“You don’t even know my real name, I’m the fucking lizard king,” is the best quote from the show."
vaporents,fns95o4,t3_g3ml1o,1587216204.0,"I think I had the exact same G pen when I first started vaping. Thought it was decent until I upgraded to the mighty. Now I’m horrified I ever used it lol. Get a mighty and it’s the last vape you will ever need. Now is the perfect time to find a good deal for 4/20. I bought mine on 4/20 4 years ago and I’m literally using it as I type this lol. I’ve had it replaced once via Storz and Bickel RMA because the charger stopped connecting. I originally bought it from Puff It Up. Use the dosing caps, keep it clean, and enjoy long sessions of insane clouds that gets you very high."
DunderMifflin,fns7vcl,t3_g3mlx0,1587215218.0,"There are a lot of people that hate the Will Ferrel episodes and basically every episode past when Michael leaves and honestly I don’t get it. It’s still a fucking hilarious show and the new characters that are introduced are so fucking funny in their own way. I promise it’s worth it, keep an open mind."
AmItheAsshole,fns6h0c,t3_g3mt16,1587214094.0,"Jesus Christ YTA for so many fucking reasons. You don’t get to decide what brings her joy. 

1. She has one fucking thing that makes her happy and that causes ZERO harm to you or anyone (in fact she is saving money and the environment by re-using jars). I DO THE SAME THING I LOVE HAVING BIG GLASS JARS WITH ICE WATER. I DONT USE THE REGULAR HOUSEHOLD CUPS. ITS JUST A PREFERENCE. 
2. You have no right to throw away something of hers without asking. And if you had asked and she said no, you still have no right. 
3. You TOLD HER IT WASN’T IMPORTANT BECAUSE SHE WAS ONLY USING THEM TO LOSE WEIGHT WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IF THAT WAS HER INTENTION. YOU HAVE NOW MADE IT CLEAR THAT YOU THINK SHE NEEDS TO LOSE WEIGHT, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME NOT SUPPORTING HER EVEN IF SHE WAS TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT. 

You can call me dramatic but this would cause me to leave without a doubt. You have no respect for your girlfriend and I hope she finds someone who treats her better and with more consideration."
