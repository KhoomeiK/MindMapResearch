Sorry, Dad. I know.

It took months before the novelty of this shtick wore off; it's like nobody had ever considered that maybe, just MAYBE, what a society fueled by guilt and shame needs more than anything else is forgiveness. The trick, of course, is that they can't know that it was all in their heads to begin with. As long as I keep using the divine power line, they buy it. As if that big bearded douchebag could heal a paper cut. But it pays the bills, and I thought there was some real meaning in it. At first the rush of watching these idiots gasp and bow down when the spoon-fed bullshit starts to kick in made me feel alive. I used to wake up excited. I used to jump out of bed the minute my awareness returned. Now I don't even want to open my eyes. I just want to doze off again, for as long as I possibly can. But those fucking birds. Ugh.

I tell myself that it's important to set intentions and meditate before seeing the light of day, but I know better than to believe my own advice these days. I try it anyway. It almost feels productive, but mostly I just don't want to move yet.

Today, I tell myself, I am going to... fuck it, who am I kidding. I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to bullshit thousands of idiots, make some cash, and get trashed. Intentions, schmintentions. All this new age spiritual crap drives me nuts before I even start. 

I don't know why, but the birds shut the fuck up for a minute. It's a miracle if I ever witnessed one. I take a deep breath and drift off again.

...

""Chirk-chikka-chirooooo!""

I swear the wildlife around here is just pissing me off on purpose. It never used to be this way. It's almost like the big guy up there is bored and just wants to get on my nerves... what a dick.

I hear the neighbors bustling about. It must actually be time to get up. In a heroic burst of effort, I flutter my eyelids open. Or I try, anyway. What the shit? Did someone glue my eyes shut? I scrape an overgrown fingernail over one of the lashes, yielding a chunk of yellowish goo. It's the first thing I see, and I wish I had just left it on there and taken the day off. Gross. Like the asshole that I am, I wipe it on my tunic and start digging into the other eye.

Once I've blinked the rest of the shit out - blinked? Blunk? I never know how to conjugate verbs like that. Think, thunk, drink, drunk, blink... blinked. Everything is stupid. Anyway, I sit up groggily and turn to look at the lady.

""Jesus!"" she exclaims.

""Uh.... Magda!"" I can never tell whether she's freaking out about something or just saying my name. It doesn't have the same ring when I say hers. Maybe it would if I used her first name, but that always made me feel like I was fucking my mom.

""Your eyes... they're bright red!""

""Pretty sure they're blue, babe. Have you been picking mushrooms around Mount Sinai again?""

She scoffs. ""Not the blue part, the white part! Oh God, that's disgusting. You're going to have to take the day off.""

""I told you,"" I start. I sigh, soften my tone. ""I told you I'm not into the daddy shit. My name is Jesus. Call me Jesus, Jeez, White Jesus, Zombie Jesus, The Dude, whatever you want. Don't call me God.""

""It's just an expression."" She looks hurt, a little. I try to care.

I get up and splash some water in my face. It's not like it's the first time I've woken up looking hungover as shit. I don't know what her deal is. After the first time I pulled the wine trick the gang wants me to do it every night. What am I supposed to do? Fucktards around here don't even care that I'm just distracting them and switching out the bottles, but they get so pious when they're drunk that I end up walking out with more than enough cash to buy more booze for the next day. I mean, it's Two-Denarii-Chuck to begin with, and I usually get a discount on top of the sale price. It's not my fault. I have to drink with them. Part of the job.

Magdalen has already set the table and ladled some porridge in my bowl by the time I get to the other room. My stomach turns. Dad LITERALLY made pigs just for us to eat, I TOLD everyone that the Old Testament Kosher crap is over, and she's so preoccupied with my cholesterol that I still haven't seen bacon in weeks. I promised her that I'm not going to die of natural causes no matter how fat and diabetic I get, but she started crying and the conversation was over. Gotta learn when to keep the omniscience to myself.

Now she's staring at my face. She got so wasted one night that she shit the bed and I pretended not to notice, but I wake up looking a little bloodshot and she's going to crucify me for it.

As if reading my mind, she says ""It's not just the booze, Jesus. It looks really bad. Why don't you just use your power to heal it? If you can do cripples and lepers I think you can manage a little case of pink-eye...""

My train of thought screeches to a halt, damn near derailing. All this time I thought she knew what kind of guy I was. I went on a sarcastic rant the first night we were together, how *blessed* we all were to be *graced* by my *miraculous skill*. She laughed. Magda isn't exactly the brightest candle in Galilee but I've been assuming this whole time that we had some understanding about what I've been doing. Dumb bitch just laughed because I was laughing. It's like the concept of irony won't be invented for hundreds of years... oh yeah.

Fuck it. I'm already having a shitty day. I might as well just burst her bubble.

""Magda, have you ever noticed that when I heal someone with a bad back or a case of clinical depression or some other shit that COULD be just made up crap, they stick around to praise me?""

""Of course! They love you so, Jesus.""

""Yeah, but..."" how to explain? ""have you also noticed that whenever it's an actual visible problem, they just say they feel better and then dip and don't come back? The lepers don't clear up on the spot, that guy with the Javelin injury in his leg was still limping...""

She looks up with those big, beautiful eyes. She really buys the whole act. She opens her mouth, closes it, opens it again. ""The letters they send, Jesus. They're filled with nothing but gratitude. We all understand that some things take time, and they tell us all about how much better they feel.""

Christ, I think. She's dumber than a bag of hammers. But she loves me. She might make weak-ass porridge, but she's always looking out for me. And that move she does where she puts her hands on my thighs and rides up and down... those little dimples above her buttcheeks, blinking with pleasure as she moans... I scoot my chair in a little further, obscuring the tent I'm erecting in my tunic. 

Jesus, I think, you're a conniving son of a bitch, but you're lying to yourself if you think you'll find a better lay than this among the peasants. All I would have to do to scare her away at this point is show her that all the letters are in the same handwriting. The tablets are the same shape and size, same chisel width. Because they're from the value pack I bought a month ago.  But she doesn't need to know that.

I sigh. Look up. Take her in. ""Magda, you're not going to believe this, but the Heavenly Dad told me last night that he's giving me... night vision!"" She gasps, overjoyed. Zero critical thinking involved. ""Yeah,"" I go on, ""he said the redness will wear off after a week or two. The guys are going to be super juiced when I show them how it works.""

Deception is a sin. I guess it's a good thing I'm reforming monotheism to make sure assholes like me can sin all they want for personal gain and know they'll be forgiven and loved anyway. It's just a little ruse to make some cash and stay popular, really. Nobody even knows what I'm doing. They're sinning LESS since I told them it's cool with God either way, and I don't think the trend will reverse anytime soon. It's a good thing that I'm doing. In a couple thousand years people will have forgotten all about the kinda douchey guy who brought the good news, and I'm 110% sure nobody will see the loophole and start lying and killing and sinning for personal gain just because they know God doesn't really give a shit.

The legacy of Jesus Christ will be a legacy of peace, love, and now thanks to my poor hygiene... night vision! Fuck yeah."

bayarea,fjkssnz,t3_fdxlah,1583433191.0,"Crackpipes actually break on the regular while smoking crack due (I assume) to the repeated expansion and contraction of the glass as the pipe heats up and cools down. A heavy crack smoker might go through a few in one session if he has a lot of crack or if he uses a torch to heat it up. One crackpipe in San Francisco usually costs $2 which will not get you a respectable amount of crack but the extra $6 it would take you to be sure you won't go without a pipe all night could cover a good sized rock if you're buying from the right people.

Now you might be thinking that if someone could afford enough crack to break multiple pipes in one night they could get by with a little less crack and an extra few pipes, but logic and reasoning don't always function the same way (/at all) if you smoke a lot of crack. Stimulants also do a remarkable job of deactivating whatever parts of the brain are responsible for guilt and empathy so the crackhead in question is probably mercifully free of the emotional load you or I would deal with when fucking over a motorcycle commuter.

The way I see it the only solutions for this guy are a combination of preparedness and forgiveness (which seems to have failed on both fronts as his first line of defense) and brutal crackbashing violence (what seems to be coming next)."

bayarea,fizomgk,t1_fizneh4,1582868937.0,"Surprisingly little, at least from my perspective. There is still a black market for weed because people grow it without licensing, people work trim jobs on legal and illegal grow ops and get paid in weed and stuff like that. I've come up on (/stole, I'll admit it) a super cheap ounce here and there and sold $5 bags that were probably around 1.5 grams to get by or traded them for cigarettes or hard drugs. It's very safe to buy and sell even on the street and pretty easy to gauge quality by appearance and smell so if you offer someone a really good deal and they are weed smokers they'll take it more often than not. Easy to liquidate and very little legal risk even if you're selling it illegally.

A lot of people in the bay are also super generous with their weed, so if you find the right person and chat them up you can just ask them to throw you a nug and end up with a free gram or more which you can then advertise by smoking in public and flip for a few bucks. It's not consistent but an easy opportunistic hustle if you don't need a lot of money right the fuck now. That tends to work better in Oakland than the city but really you've gut a chance anywhere in the bay.

I would say weed is probably THE easiest thing to sell to strangers around here. If I offered you a diamond ring for $10 you would probably assume it was a scam and refuse, if I offered a heroin addict heroin he would either be broke or already have a connect or else just try to rob me, if I offered food you might assume it was unclean or not up to restaurant quality but everyone is down for a good deal on a bag of weed from a stranger.

Edit: reread the question, oops lol. I would say the legalization of weed has had almost no impact on the hard drug scene. Those of us who like more powerful drugs often enjoy weed too but it's no replacement for our drugs of choice, just an afterthought or a nice side dish to go with the main course."

bayarea,fiyrvmd,t1_fiyo5ob,1582845554.0,"It's so much cheaper and more potent than anything else on the market that the way to make money selling drugs of a similar profile is to replace them with fentanyl and not tell anyone. I could buy a gram of fentanyl on the darknet for under $100 and if it's relatively pure I could divide it into hundreds of doses that are big enough to get hundreds of people (with a low opiate tolerance) high. So if you replace another downer with fentanyl you can pay pennies for a good dose and then sell it for the same price as the real thing at an unbelievable markup. Instant release oxycodone pills (""blues"", 30mg) go for up to $30 on the street and will get you high as fuck if you don't have a tolerance. They are rare and well controlled these days but if you have a pill press you can make fake ones with fractions of a dollar worth of fent in them that will get you just as high.

One risk is that an at-home drug chemist/drug dealer will not do the math right or mix it properly so some pills have a disproportionate amount of fent in them and are way more deadly than the equivalent real product. The bigger danger in my opinion comes when people put fentanyl on drugs other than opiates. Say I want to make money selling fake Xanax with fentanyl in it. A normal Xanax bar has 2mg alprazolam in it. If you don't have a benzodiazepine tolerance you will get wasted off one bar or less. If you use a lot you might need two or three to get really high. So let's say it takes 1mg fentanyl to get someone with no opiate tolerance really high (just made up, if the fentanyl is pure or if its an analogue like carfentanyl the dose will be much lower but I want a nice clean number). I put 1mg of fent in each bar so that everyone who takes one will get really high and come back for more. But alprazolam tolerance =/= opiate tolerance, so the guy who normally needs 3 Xanax bars to get high ends up taking triple the dose of fentanyl that he's intended to, overdoses, and dies. A bunch of kids died in Livermore on the same night a few years back because they took fake xannie bars with fent in them and ended up with way more of a different drug in their system than they expected.

Harm reduction clinics like needle exchanges are starting to carry fentanyl test strips which will indicate if a sample of a drug is fentanyl positive so at least you know. These are useful if you're not a die hard addict and/or you're not taking opiates in the first place. However everyone I know who uses heroin regularly understands that there's fentanyl in some of it and doesn't care because it will give them the high they want if it doesn't kill them. Fent is showing up in all kinds of stuff lately, even uppers that should be a very different high. So if your friend is not addicted to heroin or other opiates he or she should get some test strips to test Xanax, coke, meth etc. But if they are an opiate addict a positive fentanyl test is really just a green light to play Russian roulette. The real solution here is to never use alone and always carry Narcan so that if you take a big dose of fent and stop breathing the overdose can be reversed and you can carry on.

Also never be afraid to call 911! California's good Samaritan law prohibits law enforcement from arresting you and charging you with nonviolent drug offenses if you call 911 to report an overdose, no matter how much of what drugs you possess/are on. Paramedics have saved many of my friends lives and my own this way. It's so routine for them every time I've been involved in one of these cases they tell us wearily that this is the third/fifth/nth narcan revival they've done on this shift but God damn does it save some lives."

Now it's run by a gang from Honduras with bigger bags, better prices, and surprisingly good customer service.

The problem is that they are almost certainly not real, but rather imitation pills filled with unknown and inconsistent amounts of fentanyl. Speaking of fentanyl it is also now available for sale just as a powder that is cheaper, stronger, and more lethal than heroin ever will be (but don't worry a lot of the heroin has fentanyl in it too so it will kill you just as good.) 

Source: I've been buying drugs in the TL on and off since 2009. The Hondo's are a welcome change because one gang runs most of the neighborhood and has a reputation to uphold so they are consistent and businesslike. I've never been ripped off by anyone who (I assume) is in this gang whereas non affiliates are basically engaging in a free for all and will take you for everything you've got. I try not to be racist in most of my day to day life but I will not buy drugs from black people or white people in the TL. No Hispanic accent? I don't trust you and I won't deal with you.

Honestly even if you're getting good clean crystal it can fuck up your mental health for months or even years.

psychology,fef7fab,t1_feetj7a,1579049956.0,">As for general advantages, there are some good studies [here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7a3d/cab3759aea912878e37991736d55c83dbac2.pdf?_ga=2.51984416.821673044.1579040162-818735188.1555848370), [here](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/99/11/4328/2836760), and [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-016-0621-y) but generally the conclusion is leaning towards there being no clear advantages for transwomen. Most can be explained by genetic quirks that exist in ciswomen as well.

How do you get that conclusion from the articles you cited? The first one concluded the following:

>The conclusion is that androgen deprivation in M–F increases the overlap in muscle mass with women but does not reverse it, statistically. The question of whether reassigned M–F can fairly compete with women depends on what degree of arbitrariness one wishes to accept, keeping in mind, for instance, that similar blood testosterone levels in men have profoundly different biologic effects on muscle properties, rendering competition in sports intrinsically a matter of how nature endows individuals for this competition.

That sounds to me like an explanation of how androgen levels alone do not explain sex disparities in athletic performance, which ends up being a good counterpoint to your first three paragraphs.

The second one didn't seem to mention trans people at all, and was about variance of testosterone in female athletes. Since the first one concluded that male and female bodies respond differently to testosterone even at the same level, it doesn't seem relevant. 

The third one was a review of 8 research papers. Your first article was one of them, and the other seven were about the experience of trans athletes, not performance discrepancies between trans and cis athletes. Somehow they concluded that there were no discrepancies even though the only study they reviewed that even looked at the subject didn't seem to conclude anything either way, although (as quoted above) it pointed out that testosterone level alone is not the only predictor of muscle mass and tone, which seems to imply that hormone therapy can't close the gap.

>It's also relevant to consider the fact that a lot of these concerns will also be alleviated in the future given that now science has progressed where trans awareness and resources to help people transition have become so widely available, there will be less trans people (and therefore trans athletes) who have gone through puberty (of their assigned gender) and experienced any possible biological advantages.

I agree with this. It would be great if everyone who would eventually transition could transition as soon as they knew it was right for them, and that might change the landscape. In the meantime it seems to me that the only reason to believe that trans women who transition in adulthood lose all or most of the biological advantages of being taller and stronger when they transition is out of sheer desire for it to be true, which isn't a very good reason to believe something."
BipolarReddit,fe690ey,t3_envrnq,1578884434.0,"My suggestion is that you work on separating your personal self worth and well being from the outcome of any help you offer your daughter. There are more different angles on treating bipolar disorder and substance abuse now than there used to be. Maybe one day she'll be receptive to your help, and you can help her decide what kind of rehab to get into or what treatment to undergo and arrange for her to get it started. Then, hopefully, it will work and she will start to recover. 

&#x200B;

Or maybe she'll never be receptive to your help, or you'll help her decide on treatment options, do as much research as you can, make personal sacrifices to cover the cost, transportation, attend family sessions, etc and the treatment won't work and she won't recover. Of course, nothing we can say will make that not hurt. But the best way to ensure that you are okay emotionally is to do whatever you can for her and then let that be enough. You don't control the outcome.

&#x200B;

There are support groups out there for loved ones of people with substance abuse problems and mental illness. Al-anon and Nar-anon are popular options as sister programs to Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. They aren't for everyone, and even though they're not affiliated with particular religions they are ""spiritual"" in nature which means a lot of prayer and talk of god. My parents can't stomach them for that reason, which is also part of why I don't use AA or NA for support myself anymore, but if that's not a problem for you they are great, supportive communities of people going through similar things. NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, is another good source of support. Depending on where you are (within the USA) they have options for families who are suffering because of their loved ones' mental illness.

When we see male chimps raid other groups and improve their access to mates, we don't have to speculate on what the chimps are thinking to understand how evolution favors this behavior. If we observed that a lot of male humans who went to war ended up raping women, or for that matter having consensual sex, as a result of going to war we could conclude that men who were inclined to go to war were over represented in the next generation and that warlike tendencies were selected for in this way. Even if the men had politics or religion in mind as they killed and reproduced, the simple fact that men who liked war made more of themselves than men who didn't would explain  why more men in generations to come might be inclined toward war.

It's sort of crude and unpleasant to think of female mates as resources for males, but when we look at the process of evolution by natural and sexual selection, particularly in non monogamous species, it's hard to see it any other way."
AskSocialScience,fds8pwr,t3_emx546,1578696906.0,"Establishing clear causal links in a case like this is tough, and I'm not going to pretend to answer your question directly. However, I think it's useful to break the question down into smaller questions, which can be answered more easily and with more certainty and then inform the larger situation.

[This source](https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap) appears to fall into the category you mentioned of people who research the gender pay gap in order to prove that it exists and close it. However, in addition to concluding that women in the US earn $.79 for every dollar men earn, they also concluded that women in the same position/title at the same company with the same number of years of experience earn $.98 for the man's dollar. The $.02 gap, while still worthy of our attention, implies that most of the overall gender pay gap probably isn't due to blatant sexism with regard to pay rate for identical work with the same title.

That being said, there is an independent body of evidence in favor of the idea that people, both men and women, discriminate in their attitudes toward coworkers and bosses based on gender. [This](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/women-bosses-more-likely-to-be-called-bitchy-emotional-and-bossy-10090606.html) wasn't actually what I was looking for while googling on the subject but it's interesting - it surveyed small business owners and found that female bosses were significantly more likely to be called ""emotional,""  ""bitchy,"" or ""bossy"" than male bosses. Their survey didn't ask about other unkind words that might have been male-skewed, so we don't know if the men are being called ""dick,"" ""douchebag,"" ""asshole,"" or anything else at a greater rate than women. We also don't know whether, for some reason, women in these workplaces exhibited unpleasant traits that the employees were accurately referring to and that men didn't exhibit as much. 

The study I was actually looking for when I found the one mentioned above was a little more illustrative of what's really going on. I can't seem to find a link to it, but if someone knows the one I'm about to refer to please comment with the link if you have it. This one recorded men and women reading the same script with similar inflection and then played it for participants. On average, the participants rated the women's readings as rude and bitchy and the men's readings as confident. In the previous paragraph I wondered whether female bosses being rated bitchy and such was a consequence of some female-specific behavior that ""bitchy"" refers to. Now we see that, at least sometimes, behaviors seem to be labeled ""bitchy"" *because they are exhibited by women*, and that they are not as easily labeled ""bitchy"" if exhibited by men - in fact, the replacement descriptors might be positive, not even a parallel male gendered slur.

Where am I going with this? The across the board gender pay gap is pretty uncontroversial, but some people appeal to factors outside of sexism in the workplace to explain it. I have heard mentioned such ideas as that women choose lower paying careers for personal reasons or even that many women take maternity leave which holds them back in their career development. Those might be part of the explanation, and they would certainly be hard to rule out completely. But remember that the $.79-$.98 discrepancy is because the latter accounts for title and experience, which could themselves easily be affected by discrimination. Success in the workplace, including not only pay raises but also promotions and assignment of projects, depends on support from all angles. 

If female managers are thought of as bitchy for the same actions that male managers would be called confident for, their teams might not be as productive and they might not get promoted or get prestigious assignments in the future. If women are thought of as annoying when they make requests or demands of coworkers, whereas men would be thought of as assertive, they might not be able to get the help they need to get things done. And certainly if higher ups hear a woman's request for a pay raise as whiny whereas the same request by a man would be strong and endearing, it will affect the likelihood that they'll get the raise.

My final thought is that, as someone who believes in equal pay for equal work as an ideal and believes that we're not there yet, the burden is partially upon me as an employee and a coworker to treat the women I work with equally. Sometimes my bosses do things that make me uncomfortable or ask me to do things that I don't want to do. Am I more on board if the boss is a man? Do I change the language I use when speaking about bosses or coworkers if they're female in a way that makes it harder for them to do their jobs? We can do our best to hold managers accountable for paying equally for equal work and for promoting without discriminating, but we also have to do our part to be mindful of how we treat people ourselves."
