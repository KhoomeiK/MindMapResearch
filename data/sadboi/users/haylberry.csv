Type1Diabetes,fohsjht,t3_g7dgy3,1587771809.0,I work in hospitality too and I wouldn’t dream of taking an injection behind a bar or where I am in view of customers... Surely there is a more appropriate setting where you can quickly take your shot... if I went out to a restaurant and saw someone injecting behind a bar I would also be quite put off..

BPD,f06aoee,t3_d3wk6x,1568433730.0," I so struggle to grasp how co-morbid ASD and BPD works... considering the polarisation in emotionality that presents in the two diagnoses... ASD = need for frequent alone time/intolerance of others company, lack of empathy,  poor ability to understand/interpret others minds/emotional states... whereas BPD = fear of abandonment, highly dependent and reliant on others for their well-being, highly sensitive and often highly empathic, often well attuned to reading others and their emotional states... jddjnfnf just how"
seduction,etpy3lb,t3_ccqhqg,1563067540.0,What? Omg no . What? Hahahaha . Don’t touch them. Most normal girls don’t appreciate a random stranger coming up and touching them. That’s weird and usually unwelcome.
