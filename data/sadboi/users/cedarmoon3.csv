Quakers,fqo4ytp,t3_gjztg2,1589507666.0,"This question really intrigued me, since I’ve never given much thought to simplicity of dress. Clothes have always been such an important part of my self expression, and besides, my career (entertainment industry) mandates that I dress rather flashily. Other Quakers who also do my kind of work dress similarly.

I looked it up in my copy of Faith and Practice, the  Philadelphia Yearly Meeting book that’s basically about how to be a Quaker. It doesn’t say anything about simplicity of dress. The closest I could find was about environmental stewardship and violence, which I think speaks to your question because mass produced lace is so often made in sweatshops with tyrannical work policies and abysmal environmental practices.

I’m not going to claim to be an expert on this, especially since it’s not a rule I adhere to. That said, I think the best path forward is to be conscious of where your clothes are coming from and who makes them, and then making purchases that are ethically produced, such as from an ethical clothing company or secondhand. That way you’re being a good environmental steward and giving the most compassion towards workers."

The harp is not a piano, so a lot of what’s going on there (fast, wide, big jumps, occasional 3rds thrown in) is going to be virtually impossible. I would suggest orchestrating it for two harps and splitting between the bass / treble ranges — two harps is always better than one anyway!

If there’s a harpist at your school, I highly suggest reaching out to buy them dinner (or coffee, or a really great slice of cheesecake) and asking them to look through it. Nothing beats a harpist in real life actually looking at your harp part and offering suggestions. If you do research on all the major harp composers, they were either harpists, had harpists fix the parts with no credit (looking at you, Tchaikovsky), or had a harpist colleague they worked closely with. Good luck!"
