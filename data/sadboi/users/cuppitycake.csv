TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fr3w5k4,t1_fr3rvw5,1589867970.0,I pay $2900! I couldn‚Äôt imagine a $500 rent payment.
thebachelor,fr3uqo4,t1_fr32s51,1589866821.0,I‚Äôm sure she made a weekend out of it and stayed a couple nights.
thebachelor,fr3ubuy,t1_fr3ofrh,1589866493.0,Doesn‚Äôt really matter but Gilbert is only about 6 hours from Orange County.
thebachelor,fqymcja,t1_fqxx8t5,1589750926.0,"I‚Äôm not saying this is ok by any means but I can see people thinking that gay people don‚Äôt usually call themselves f*ggots and the word isn‚Äôt really used much anymore but black people call themselves the n word and use it in popular songs so white people think it‚Äôs ok to use the word. Again, totally NOT ok but just my thought process trying to figure out why it happens."
thebachelor,fqyl6w5,t1_fqyh23r,1589750388.0,I‚Äôm afraid to agree with you but I agree with you.
GetMotivated,fqs3ir7,t1_fqqegvt,1589597695.0,May I ask if the people you were getting away from were family? I‚Äôm in a similar position and I‚Äôm thinking about moving.
thebachelor,fqrirmq,t1_fqq381u,1589585183.0,Try it! I‚Äôve tried soo many different kinds and this looks the best and covers great.
thebachelor,fqoge1i,t3_gk1kez,1589514644.0,My Est√©e Lauder double wear foundation to hide my acne and scars.
thebachelor,fqodckm,t1_fqltw2v,1589512712.0,Same feelings. Auto tuned and basic. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad but nothing special. I had the thought that any good producer could probably make anyone sound like she did in that song.
thebachelor,fq7s0u1,t1_fq6tmbj,1589151025.0,Love your sub style. I frequent most of those too! I‚Äôd say the two reality show subs I like the most are The Bachelor and Teen Mom.
thebachelor,fq7rt5k,t1_fq6sjo0,1589150903.0,I literally only watch the show so that I can talk about it on here. I find the show boring these days but it‚Äôs so fun to talk about it on here and hear about drama outside of the show.
thebachelor,fq7rdfi,t1_fq79tkl,1589150651.0,Came here to say this. Do people with naturally thick brows get them micro bladed? Maybe her brows are filled in here with makeup and they‚Äôre naturally thinner.
thebachelor,fq7r0o0,t1_fq78x71,1589150447.0,It‚Äôs our time to shine! I can embrace my thicker brows and don‚Äôt have to spend money on micro blading. Trends come and go and that‚Äôs why I always say be happy with how you are naturally because it will be ‚Äúin‚Äù some time or another.
thebachelor,fq7qhss,t1_fq7lzji,1589150150.0,"It‚Äôs funny because I remember when the first pictures came out of her dress, so many people had negative things to say about Lauren‚Äôs dress. I think it‚Äôs beautiful!"
thebachelor,fq6g40r,t1_fq61ykt,1589130853.0,I‚Äôm currently reading his book and I had the thought that I kind of wish he waited to write it until after they broke up (if they break up). I think it would be very interesting.
thebachelor,fq0wta6,t1_fq0hr8x,1589038625.0,She commented on his most recent post. Maybe it seems like there‚Äôs distance because of the whole social distancing thing. He wanted to go back to see his family and I‚Äôm sure Cassie wanted to stay near her family at a time like this and not mingle with others.
thebachelor,fpx4gbu,t1_fpug4up,1588975472.0,That‚Äôs fine. I just meant I don‚Äôt see them anymore.
thebachelor,fptijrc,t3_gf66ra,1588891899.0,I miss the unverified tea posts.
thebachelor,fpti3j4,t1_fps0lpa,1588891661.0,Me too
AskReddit,fpqqy18,t1_fpq52tr,1588829703.0,I did a dance to this song in middle school. Surprised they approved it.
thebachelor,fpk85d3,t3_gdwbpd,1588689834.0,These are the type of comments that make me rethink him being the bachelor üòÇ
Moissanite,fpinvsf,t3_gcub10,1588644846.0,I have a round diamond engagement ring and just bought a moissanite oval engagement ring so I can switch between the two. I think it‚Äôs great to have options and my husband doesn‚Äôt mind.
thebachelor,fpihgfu,t3_gdnnnt,1588640985.0,These guys just comment on her posts so they get more likes and follows on their own pages. I wouldn‚Äôt read too much into it.
thebachelor,fphuyjf,t3_gdfewd,1588628280.0,I like a mixture of both! Polls give us instant gratification and the brackets keep us engaged for a longer period of time.
thebachelor,fphug90,t1_fphinna,1588628013.0,I thought I read somewhere that women had to be on birth control if they went on the show? Could be wrong though.
thebachelor,fpf11tq,t3_gd29qw,1588559320.0,This is 100% the same sushi in both of the pics. The boxes are the same. What are the odds that they would both be getting sushi separately from the exact same place at the exact same time? Especially being exes.
thebachelor,fpe9ywb,t3_gcxrzx,1588543319.0,I‚Äôve always liked him. I feel like he and Ashley get a lot of crap here but Jared was always sweet and I think he‚Äôs very attractive.
thebachelor,fpb2b04,t1_fpaev8y,1588460615.0,I think it has to do with the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio called  ‚ÄúCatch Me If You Can‚Äù it‚Äôs about a young pilot. I believe he sees himself the same way and now he saying he has been caught by Kelley. Lol
thebachelor,fpaz24u,t1_fpaidnp,1588458691.0,Yeah. Peter has the best looking contestants for sure. I remember watching the first episode and being blown away.
thebachelor,fpaxxz0,t3_gcem6d,1588458025.0,I‚Äôm not so sure he would‚Äôve ended up with Kelley if he would‚Äôve been able to galavant around LA with his bachelor status.
thebachelor,fp47r8v,t3_gaoyox,1588293384.0,I see Tyler and Hannah as pals. Kind of like a bro/sis thing. I think he cares about her a ton but not in any kind of a romantic way.
thebachelor,fp46g6o,t1_fp2jdcb,1588292633.0,"Yeah, it‚Äôs too ginormous looking"
thebachelor,fp0gmfw,t1_fp04ymb,1588208876.0,That‚Äôs how I understood it also.
thebachelor,fp0gd11,t1_fp02g3u,1588208728.0,Imagine being Lauren and knowing Arie‚Äôs season is airing and needing to dodge the season again. I remember she said she never watched it or at least didn‚Äôt watch the last few episodes. It would bring up a lot of stuff for her I think.
nostalgia,fp0fpls,t3_ga9khz,1588208368.0,I still use mine! I keep it in my car to listen to all my old music with.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fowwvt8,t3_ga0gz8,1588128898.0,Isn‚Äôt she the one that said she hated white people a while back?
thebachelor,fowq9lb,t1_fow0794,1588124881.0,I just realized he kind of looks like Adam Sandler.
thebachelor,foul4vk,t1_fouc2hv,1588086046.0,"Really? Everywhere I look, I see people comparing the two. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unpopular."
thebachelor,fot8qib,t3_g9csp6,1588047272.0,He‚Äôs a cutie
thebachelor,fos783r,t1_foqzo0w,1588025224.0,You must live with I live. The same exact shit happens in my city community Facebook group.
thebachelor,fos6ax0,t3_g99fx2,1588024750.0,Why does it look like her head is pasted on her body?
thebachelor,fop05rl,t1_foospkb,1587950175.0,Oh yes to the Peter comment. I remember I liked Peter and wanted him to be bachelor and I would get attacked by people who wanted mike as bachelor. Most people were pro Mike as bachelor back before the decision was made.
thebachelor,foohe0o,t1_fonjaft,1587938991.0,Agreed. I don‚Äôt think Hannah is Tyler‚Äôs type.
thebachelor,foogvlv,t1_fonrep8,1587938733.0,"For sure. I wasn‚Äôt spoiled during Hannah‚Äôs season and when the season ended, I couldn‚Äôt believe all of the Tyler hype. I never saw that much of a spark between him and Hannah and he hardly stood out. Tyler wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as famous and loved without the wrong RS spoiler."
thebachelor,foofwl8,t1_fonnojp,1587938232.0,I WILL DIE ON THIS HILL ALONG SIDE YOU.
thebachelor,foofrfg,t1_fonh8de,1587938159.0,I wonder if she regrets moving on so quickly. I saw it as her beating Shawn to the punch but he is still single.
thebachelor,foofaxq,t1_fonk1l6,1587937923.0,Me too! I respect her relationship with Jason but I love her chemistry with Nick. I think they would have such a fun life together.
thebachelor,fon8xb5,t1_fomvupi,1587914759.0,Hannah was also at the beach with a ton of people yesterday. It doesn‚Äôt show it but I know the beach and it was packed.
thebachelor,fon8de4,t3_g8ezsk,1587914433.0,Just watched her insta stories. Why the F was she at the beach? I live near there and you‚Äôre not supposed to be gathering at the beach right now. So many people in my county are pissed about these people ignoring the guidelines. Go back to wherever you came from Hannah.
thebachelor,fon7si3,t1_fon2aih,1587914090.0,So many hugs! I haven‚Äôt even been able to hug my dad in 5 weeks.
thebachelor,fon7p6t,t1_fon3qvm,1587914035.0,"It‚Äôs goes back to how our society is now with ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt post about it on social media, it didn‚Äôt happen‚Äù. People are dumb and even though they know they are doing something wrong, they can‚Äôt let an event go by without posting about it so their followers know they‚Äôre cool and doing fun stuff."
IAmA,folwza4,t1_fokukn2,1587872496.0,Wow that completely describes me. I always just thought I just had bad anxiety. I wonder what the difference is and to know if I have quiet BPD for sure.
thebachelor,folkodc,t1_folf574,1587864307.0,I would have loved to see that! Last minute switch making Hannah bachelorette and Matt is already locked in to filming. They end up falling for each other even though he swore to Tyler he wouldn‚Äôt. Tyler then realized Hannah is the love of his life but he missed his chance. Hannah and Matt get married.
thebachelor,folemw1,t1_foldlcf,1587860588.0,I agree that he would have a much better connection with Tayshia or Tia.
thebachelor,fold0dj,t1_folb161,1587859614.0,I don‚Äôt think it would have mattered if the bachelorette was a two headed donkey. He would go all in for whoever as long as he got more fame and followers.
thebachelor,folc4vx,t1_folblyn,1587859091.0,No wtf
thebachelor,fokvg58,t1_fokvcyi,1587849707.0,HAHAH damnnn these girls cant catch a break.
thebachelor,fokuzvf,t1_fok78zi,1587849464.0,Has Shawn said anywhere that he‚Äôs interested? I‚Äôm curious if it‚Äôs actually something that could happen.  Would be interesting that‚Äôs for sure.
thebachelor,fokuf7n,t1_fokag7m,1587849151.0,Why do they say you don‚Äôt bond as much with a c-section baby? Doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.
thebachelor,fokpuqv,t3_g809rb,1587846664.0,Yes!! I never get any good ones of these but I can die happy isolating with Peter K. Thanks bye.
thebachelor,fojn7bl,t1_fojbjfv,1587825113.0,"Negative comments about someone‚Äôs baby/child, anything bad to say about Hannah and Tyler, having any sort of opinion different from the majority, sticking up for peter in any sort of way, liking halo engagement rings."
thebachelor,foiezbq,t1_foi9i0c,1587785099.0,Yeah...this is just too much. He needs to stop haha
thebachelor,fohe2qt,t1_fogjkav,1587764400.0,That‚Äôs cool. I‚Äôm surprised she has the only yellow gold ring because they are so popular now. I wonder if we will see more in the future. Most of my friends that have gotten engaged within the last couple years have gold.
thebachelor,foh7b6t,t3_g7fzw7,1587761333.0,"Didn‚Äôt she have her short, natural hair on the Bachelor? It looked great! I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt have extensions while going on national television when without them, she feels so insecure. Unless she did have them but they were just short extensions for volume?"
thebachelor,foh5wkk,t1_fofs8fh,1587760892.0,Totally! I just don‚Äôt think Peter or Tyler C aren‚Äôt desperate enough to put up with that crap. I‚Äôm sure other up and comers are though.
thebachelor,fod8x7p,t1_fobxply,1587681736.0,"Wow! Thanks for the explanation. I always said I‚Äôve never had it but now I think I do experience it. The other night, I had a dream that someone was attacking me so I was calling out my friend‚Äôs name to save me and nothing would come out of my mouth. I ended up waking up frozen and screaming her name out loud."
thebachelor,fod8a1a,t1_foc1937,1587681524.0,"Me too! If we think about what we knew of him only from her season, he was by far my favorite. There‚Äôs a reason he became the Bachelor."
thebachelor,fod7hj0,t1_fod5rdj,1587681207.0,"After the way Peter came out looking from his season, I can‚Äôt see Tyler or Peter K really wanting to be the Bachelor that bad right now."
thebachelor,fod764i,t1_fod4m0k,1587681049.0,What‚Äôs also interesting is that yeah it‚Äôs only 75k but he wouldn‚Äôt have been filming for a while year. He could make that 75k in a few months and then go back to his other work after and make pretty good money during that one year.
thebachelor,fo9n1dj,t1_fo8kkb9,1587624424.0,"Yes! Also, since she commented it from her own account, you don‚Äôt see your own posts on your feed so she must have gone to the photo on her account and commented it. You don‚Äôt just accidentally do that."
thebachelor,fo4k5aw,t1_fo43wui,1587505892.0,This is hilarious! Great job OP.
thebachelor,fo434it,t1_fo2sa26,1587497386.0,Or he‚Äôs here reading the recap so that he doesn‚Äôt get caught listening. That‚Äôs what I would do if I were in his position.
thebachelor,fo421tv,t1_fo2nh2k,1587496858.0,"Came here to tell everyone to go listen. It was so entertaining and if you don‚Äôt have the time, turn your audio speed up to 1.5. I got through it a lot faster."
thebachelor,fo41bza,t1_fo2wupa,1587496504.0,Yikes. I‚Äôd hate to be Kelly right now finding out all of this while having to be quarantined with the guy.
thebachelor,fo17gek,t3_g542ik,1587427300.0,"I laughed when I saw this because she posted it as a ‚Äúnice shot‚Äù sarcastic photo insinuating that it doesn‚Äôt look good when reality, she posted it because she looks amazing."
thebachelor,fo16qot,t1_fo0r9c2,1587426885.0,I‚Äôve been looking forward to the second round so much! I really hope the comments didn‚Äôt make OP want to stop. It takes a lot of work to set something like that up. People need to realize they‚Äôre doing it on their own time for free.
thebachelor,fo14iu6,t1_fo0utv4,1587425588.0,Oh that makes me sad but good to know.
thebachelor,fo0uiug,t3_g51nxn,1587420011.0,He‚Äôs lying to get a rise out of people. They very well could be engaged but I don‚Äôt think Dylan would announce it in a comment for the very first time.
thebachelor,fo0ud11,t3_g526d8,1587419925.0,That‚Äôs such a bummer! Maybe he will be more willing to be the bachelor to make some more money to get his business back on track. One can only hope.
thebachelor,fnxoaj3,t1_fnw4sj3,1587342850.0,Looks like she‚Äôs on her toe and her high rise leggings make her look longer.
thebachelor,fnxkrso,t1_fnwlkoc,1587340689.0,"I agree. I do workout but even when I don‚Äôt workout my butt that much, I always have a bubble butt because of genetics. My mom has the same thing and she doesn‚Äôt work out."
Gastritis,fnxjp0p,t3_g49mik,1587340050.0,I‚Äôve used glutamine in the past and I‚Äôm not 100% sure it helped me but I think it did! I didn‚Äôt feel very sick during the time I was taking it.
thebachelor,fnrfoan,t3_g3hiax,1587187542.0,I started watching this show tonight and had the same thought. The lips look so similar.
thebachelor,fnqfbx3,t3_g34om7,1587163492.0,I want to start trying for a baby and was supposed to start in March but I‚Äôm very scared to get pregnant with the corona virus going around. They haven‚Äôt done enough tests to know what effect it would have on pregnant women/fetus. I‚Äôm already in my 30‚Äôs and I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt be able to try for another year because we don‚Äôt know when all of this will get better. I worry I‚Äôm missing out on prime time to have a healthy pregnancy.
thebachelor,fnj2awd,t1_fnhqwjp,1586990633.0,"I feel the same. It‚Äôs funny how nobody is going out and doing things in friend groups so I thought I wouldn‚Äôt feel sad about seeing people all doing fun things together but now, I see friend groups getting on group chats together and posting on Instagram about it. So I still feel sad that I‚Äôm not getting together with friends even virtually."
thebachelor,fniywjs,t1_fngixye,1586988848.0,Same
thebachelor,fng2u72,t1_fnfr6yf,1586921010.0,I definitely get what you‚Äôre saying and agree.
thebachelor,fng29ic,t1_fnf7wdm,1586920633.0,Same. Very easy choice.
thebachelor,fng26fv,t1_fnf2nxu,1586920579.0,This was so hard for me because do I judge Lauren Lane by her old original bachelor face or her current face?
thebachelor,fng21ml,t1_fnf52rf,1586920491.0,Yes! I was surprised that I chose Whitney too.
thebachelor,fnft1lo,t1_fnfsqb2,1586914859.0,"Yeah. I think it‚Äôs a joke, right?"
thebachelor,fnf4c5t,t3_g156ir,1586901163.0,Tyler seems really immature and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs funny or entertaining at all. I don‚Äôt see what everyone else sees in him.
thebachelor,fnf3y3x,t1_fndo4lp,1586900964.0,Sounds like my early 20‚Äôs
thebachelor,fnbqb9k,t1_fnbjt72,1586820222.0,Agreed.
thebachelor,fnau75h,t3_g0olpg,1586803898.0,I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with him working and then quarantining with Kelly and Dustin. That‚Äôs only two people and he‚Äôs not going home to LA.
AskReddit,fn8zm06,t1_fn8z6mw,1586754704.0,I‚Äôm so sorry. My heart goes out to you. You had to do what was best for you. I hope you feel better soon.
thebachelor,fn7t6m6,t3_g04xmx,1586727131.0,Hahaha
thebachelor,fn7sjoc,t1_fn57ef0,1586726761.0,"I feel like if they wanted Mike for bachelor, they would have chosen him last time."
thebachelor,fn7s9mg,t1_fn5ewhc,1586726602.0,I never saw it. She didn‚Äôt even really come into the picture until a few episodes in and she never gave me a stand out impression.
thebachelor,fn7rtqe,t1_fn64e21,1586726351.0,"Yes! To me, he seemed like the frat bro guy who goes home early because he has no substance. I was shocked he made it as far as he did."
