harrypotter,fqo123d,t1_fpe1dpi,1589505394.0,"* **Where the new entrance will be:**

The new entrance to Diagon Alley will be located in a Porta-Potty outside of London's Palace Theatre, aka, home of The Cursed Child. To distinguish this particular Porta-Potty from the other two next to it, we spray-painted the words \*bro we warned you\* on the side, a double-entendre (we warned you not to let the muggles know our secret, and we warned you not to go see Cursed Child).

* **What code, spell, password, or similar “door” the new entrance will use:**

To gain access to Diagon Alley, it is a similar process to the entrance to the Ministry of Magic. One must simply stand on the seat (we won't make you step in, that's disgusting) and tap the ceiling with their wand seven times. The witch or wizard is then transported to the corrosponding Porta-Potty in Diagon Alley. 

* **What protections will be in place to prevent something like this from happening again:**

We will wrap cellophane around the seat of the Porta-Potty. It'll confuse them for hours.

* **Any special reasons the entrance should be located in this particular place:**

Wouldn't you think I was crazy if I told you that the entrance to a whole new world was located in a smelly plastic toilet? Also, it is located behind this specific theatre because nobody wants to see Cursed Child. We all hate it.

* **Any other information the Ministry may find helpful:**

We also put the cellophane around the seat so wizards don't drop their wands into that messy oblivion of human excrement. This proved to be an issue in the trial runs of the prototype Porta-Potties."
