theres this song by Louis The Child,  the lyrics go: ""you opened up my eyes, Oh I, didn't realize.  i did not think I need ya, need ya, but now I i know I need ya, need ya, I didnt think i's end up sleepless on this phone all night.  

 but i think there is doubt sometimes where you have to give a guy a real chance, like if you have not met/dated yet and there are no red flags, then give him a real try. 

i did speak to a girl that's long distance and at first she was falling for me.  but because im still trapped things dragged and so she no longer feels she needs me. and part of me is like ya I could be doing more.  but if I could have kept the initial momentum spend time together we'd be right for each other.  she'd see things about us being together that she just cannot see apart, you have to experience and be together to realize these things.  
Up until lately I just always had a hard time figuring myself out or what I really want out of life, reminds me of the lyrics from Billie Elish,  don't ask question you do not want to know. I wish I had learned that lesson long ago.   

this past year alone ive made a lot of progress, so i have that.  and I feel the same way in that it sucks i cannot share my morning woods for one :). have had many days where i was full of testosterone and needs but because im still trapped, situation-wise, I'm left alone with no one to share these needs with.  

I know it takes effort.  I just wish our schools taught finances way more. it can legit take a year to go from late bloomer to shit together.  and a year sucks without someone there to cuddle with when you get back from a hard days work.  (it's been a long days night song by the beatles comes to mind, and I'd just like to work hard and come home to someone I can get butterflies with)  I could care less about all the entertainment in the world.  I only want to work for decent food and someone dear to me that I can cherish.  the entertainment is just there so we can enjoy it together."

vegan,fkvk1fr,t1_fkv9174,1584570786.0,"crispy tofu recipes using starch theb panko seasoning works so well.

found on reddit (forget where) :  

I take a block of extra firm tofu, and cut it into perfect sized patties. First turn it on it’s side, cut it lengthwise into thirds, then just cut the slices in half.

Get three bowls for breading, cornstarch first, milk, and finally panko seasoned with salt, garlic powder and onion powder.

Dredge the tofu in cornstarch, then dip them into milk, we used almond milk but I’m sure it doesn’t matter. Finally dredge them in panko. Put them on a baking sheet with 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil. Bake @420 for 20 minutes, flip them, and bake for 15 minutes more.

The final step if frying them in hot oil on the stove until the ideal color is achieved. It comes out crispier and tastier than I’ve ever had before. Went to culinary school and worked in some very exclusive kitchen if that gives this any credibility.
