raisedbynarcissists,fqh0s3u,t3_giou5l,1589363873.0,"Advice from someone who has a no contact order on an abusive parent:

1) Every time the order gets violated, report it to the police. A paper trail is necessary to prove why it is necessary. 

2) Report that social worker, it is negligent on their part to even suggest that you share a home with your abuser.

3) Do not let your incubator (or anyone else) guilt you into further contact, she will use that as an excuse to further her ability to harm you.

4) Do not accept any ‚Äúgifts‚Äù from her either, she will use them as a manipulation tactic and leverage for later contact. A clean cut is completely necessary for your mental, emotional and physical health and safety.

5) Seek therapy, seriously, please. You have been harmed by someone who should protect and love you, this will obviously leave emotional scarring. 

6) Make sure you have a support network and don‚Äôt be afraid to cut out enablers. You may hear ‚Äúyou have to forgive her, she‚Äôs your mother‚Äù or ‚Äúit can‚Äôt have been that bad‚Äù, or my personal favourite ‚Äúyou weren‚Äôt really abused because they were your parent‚Äù, ignore these. They are the ramblings of flying monkeys sent by an abuser to reclaim control over you."
