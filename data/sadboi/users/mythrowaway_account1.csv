But for PTSD flashbacks I need something stronger so I got gabapentin and use sparingly for when I‚Äôm hyperventilating and feeling like I‚Äôm having a nervous breakdown 

I would look into gabapentin over any other stronger stuff if you end up feeling like Lexapro alone isn‚Äôt cutting it. Gabapentin is  the least addictive one and in some cases not addictive at all. Doctors will say it has absolutely no chance of addiction or withdrawals but some beg to differ! Lol. It does make you feel very very tranquil and even a little sleepy. To me it‚Äôs the same feeling of taking a benzodiazepine. It lasts for a few hours too which is nice. I take 300mg only once in a day even though I‚Äôm allowed to take it 4 times a day. 
I want to keep my tolerance low. Tolerance on them shoots up fast

Good luck!"
CongratsLikeImFive,fqxx26z,t3_glk4ez,1589739161.0,"Congrats sweety!! Good for you!
I‚Äôm in therapy too and on medication.
It helps a ton! If it‚Äôs an anti-depressant that helps also with anxiety they can really help
Same for mood stabilizers

But...if it‚Äôs something like Xanax, Klonopin, or another benzodiazepine or even gabapentin, just be careful. Those are highly addictive (maybe not gabapentin but some say yes) and getting off can be a damn nightmare. I would know. I have PTSD from withdrawals. Anytime I bring it up I would cry remembering it. Also Some heroin addicts say getting off Heroin is easier than getting off benzodiazepines. I never did heroin but that scared me to know that, It can take months to stop having withdrawals is a doctor cold turkey pulls you off them. And tolerance grows rapidly. 

I‚Äôm on gabapentin for anxiety attacks
and I take them about once a week, sometimes twice. But I try to take them sparingly.

I also take an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer for my bipolar and BPD. Those are not addictive so I never skip them. They‚Äôre awesome. 

Lastly, what can help is the 4-7-8 breathing method when I‚Äôm trying to avoid using too much gabapentin

How are your meds working? 
What meds are you on btw?


Maybe you can reframe things during hypomania? Because anytime I feel happy I know it‚Äôs not real and won‚Äôt commit seriously to any goals that require swiping a card or registration for something. That‚Äôs something I learned too many times the hard way. 

So if you can catch yourself with that first purchase just ask yourself 
‚ÄúThe last time I happily bought a ton of shit, did I ever really use it? Will I have money for rent and bills if I buy this?‚Äù 
and then wait to buy it once the hypomania fades. Because if you still want it when you‚Äôre depressed, then you might actually really need it or want it?"

It still doesn‚Äôt mean most women who claim they were raped weren‚Äôt. Most are not lying.
Rape has been an unfortunately common experience for women since time eternal and that‚Äôs a fact.
We cannot easily fight off men.
We cannot easily prove rape either.
Very hard to win rape cases period 



4) body standard are so much harsher on women.
Do u guys have companies marketing every type of makeup and diet, fashion accessory and anti aging shit on u? No. Is there reddit sub dedicated to shitting on women who have aged? Yes. r/hitthewall 

And...Do women leave their husbands for younger women once these women hit 50 and are not as attracted to their husbands? No. Most young men aren‚Äôt interested in marrying an old woman even just as a sugar momma. And why would they? Many men want a fertile hot woman or at least cute woman. Men want tight youthful skin. It‚Äôs why so many women turn to facelifts etc 
And it‚Äôs also why many married men hire escorts or have affairs with young women. The call of tight skin or whatever

it‚Äôs  been proven women are much more forgiving of looks versus men too. They did an experiment where women catfished men on a first date and vice versa. The men who got catfished looked visibly upset or annoyed or straight up just said ‚ÄúWow I‚Äôm sorry but you lied to me and umm I‚Äôm not gonna stay. ‚Äú They felt entitled to the truth as they should.
The women on the other hand were nice and polite and stayed for the date. Some agreed to a second date. When interviewed later, the women said  they felt bad about judging so harshly and got won over by the man‚Äôs charm or personality or sense of humor and would be interested in another date to see. The men who got catfished however didn‚Äôt care to look past the surface. I‚Äôm sure personality and sense of humor etc matter to men too, but the women looking as beautiful as they pretended to be was what mattered first and foremost. It‚Äôs still wrong to catfish though.

I can also say I am dating a man who isn‚Äôt good looking to most women. We‚Äôre about to breakup but not due to looks. The bottom line is, it‚Äôs ok to have preferences in looks. It‚Äôs not shallow. But when push comes to shove, men like and prefer and chase hot women or younger women than themselves even as they themselves age into their 40‚Äôs and beyond and will even dump their wife for a 20 yrs younger new wife. Just look at Hollywood. How many 40-50 yr old women do you see married to a hot 25-30 yr old man? 
None or hardly any. But vice versa? So common! Who gets more plastic surgery? Women.
Women want attractive guys too, for sure.
We‚Äôre just more forgiving about looks.



5) Hahahah. No. What country do you live in? In America, many women work and enjoy doing so. Date-wise it‚Äôs between 2 people what they want to do/believe in.

It all depends.

 they‚Äôre no less worthy of love than a ‚Äúdamaged‚Äù  animal üê∂that was abused and is now re-homed  to good people Animals like humans raised on abuse,  need time to trust, needs someone to show them what love is, and to be ok calming them down when they get anxious or act out when stressed.How can we have compassion for dogs and animals but somehow humans are just worthless??

However if a person is too abusive back to the person raised in love no matter efforts to help, the person needs to leave.

Or if they don‚Äôt want to leave quite yet, 
at least they need to encourage the other to get therapy and maybe live separately until they get a good amt counseling at least. 

But all in all, if it‚Äôs too draining and much time has been invested with no results then yes leave.

I think maybe the quote actually means
‚ÄúIf someone is abusive don‚Äôt stay‚Äù 

But to just say not to be with people raised by abusive parents, that is fucked up.

So let‚Äôs stop generalizing and teaching survivors of abuse that they‚Äôre not worthy of healthy relationships"

There was also voter suppression in inner city areas this year unlike in wealthier areas. 

*However yes many just don‚Äôt fucking care* 

It‚Äôs all a complete shit show. 

the only way to solve this is due what should be obvious and make GE voting day be a national holiday like they do in other countries and make sure that obviously it happens on the same week, letting the campaigns for all candidates have an equal opportunity. Then let them take fucking weeks or months to tally that massive same day nationwide vote. Have security measures in place. Fuck these rushed primaries and late primaries for presidential candidates. This  hurt people who most need to vote but can‚Äôt
 To address this issue I think there should be mass amts of sites that day, with equal amts of voting sites and if a ‚Äúmalfunctioning machine‚Äù becomes a long running convenient excuse for voter suppression, then there needs to be free shuttle buses for inner city residents who live too far from a voting site in other areas. 


And of course most importantly, allow voting by mail in all states. 

But none of this will ever come to pass."

That‚Äôs how it works. Hi. Welcome to reddit üëã 


Anyhow

This made up ‚Äúplaybook‚Äù of yours makes zero sense. I cannot fathom the level of delusion one must suffer from to think being a long time Bernie supporter who hates Trump and has comment history full of evidence somehow  *actually* means I‚Äôm a pro Trump troll. üòÜHow did you perform mental gymnastics to make that one have any logic to it? Do tell me. I‚Äôd love to know lol.

Oh? It‚Äôs on video that he  said
‚ÄúHey Folks go inject bleach‚Äù ? 
or 
‚ÄúCan we look into injecting bleach or household cleaners into lungs?‚Äù 

No.


He said to Mr. Brian
‚ÄúCould you do something **like that**?‚Äù
That is a question about finding a medically safe strong internal cure that works  LIKE the way regular disinfectants works by how swift and powerful it is against the virus. He is thinking ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt we have something like bleach but for internal purposes‚Äù? 


But he is dumb to have said it out loud.
It‚Äôs a wild fantasy. It is basically impossible at this time to do this and shouldn‚Äôt have been proposed out loud like that because that‚Äôs *not how viruses work*  and also his supporters are often inbred dumb ass fools who will think 
‚ÄúOh he said try Bleach!? Cool. Let me try it. ‚Äú 

I hate Trump too but I‚Äôm not going to allow my hatred to cloud reality and lose all common sense so that I don‚Äôt see what the idiot was trying to express."

*That* is your proof?  Yeah you make no sense.
But It‚Äôs pretty amusing to see you do mental gymnastics to make me look like a troll though all because you can‚Äôt handle someone looking at this objectively and who is able to see what
 Shit-For-Brains Cheetoface was trying to say. 

He said it‚Äôs sarcasm because IMO he‚Äôs a lying narcissist. He looked worse trying to cover up his gaffe with a lie. But it‚Äôs Donald Trump. Do we expect apologies? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èNever. He has a shitty ‚Äúexplanation/excuse‚Äù that he pulls out his ass for everything. He‚Äôs never wrong in his mind.

Oh you work at the White House now? We both know they  could have talked in private. No one knows when or if.  What I‚Äôm going off of is **Brian agreeing with him** at least publicly. I doubt the guy was in on any reindeer games as he seemed all business. 


Anyhow the mature thing to do would be to apologize for not explaining himself clearly and vowing to let experts handle the scientific conversations so as not to help dumb people make dumb decisions to inject bleach because they cannot comprehend what he was saying. 

But again, he‚Äôs a narcissist.

Where did he say injecting **household** disinfectant? No he did not. 
He said ‚Äúcan we do something like that‚Äù as in something that disinfects like that but for the lungs but not fucking household poison.
He never told Americans to inject anything at home or ever mentioned injecting bleach or lysol etc. 

But if he isn‚Äôt lying (yeah sure) and really was being sarcastic then he‚Äôs  a fucking moron. 

**And he‚Äôs also a moron even if he meant UV cleansing**  or anything of merit. He has no business talking about these things.

**Donald is a moron period** so we‚Äôre both clear

So do your homework before calling someone a troll. I hate Trump. Me criticizing media spin doesn‚Äôt mean I love Trump. I hate ALL media spin. They did it to Bernie. They do it to everyone.
I wish soundbites from either side didn‚Äôt exist so we all have to watch everything from beginning to end. 

Anyhow so you said 

‚ÄúAnyone listening knew he wasn‚Äôt referencing some esoteric study or treatment in research stages‚Äù 

Except he was. Did you listen to the whole conference or just his viral sound bite? 
He looked at the guy and said


‚Äú *You said you haven‚Äôt looked into that but you‚Äôre going to test it right* ‚Äú? 

Clearly they had some type of private conversation. Anyone who *actually* watched the whole press conference could tell the guy behind him knew wtf he was talkings about because Trump confirmed with him

And UV blood cleansing *already exists*  as well for other things so it‚Äôs not completely fucking idiotic to wonder if hmmm maybe it could be looked into for Coronavirus.



‚ÄúHe literally suggested using disinfectant.‚Äù 

Oh he did? 
You mean to say he meant injecting **household** disinfectant right? 

Except he did not. 

He said
‚ÄúIs there something we can do like that ?‚Äù 
Key words are
‚ÄúLIKE THAT‚Äù

He never said ‚Äúinject lysol and bleach at home‚Äù

Anyone with even just average intelligence can he clearly understand he meant something **medically usable**  as a disinfectant  that can disinfect the blood with the same potency and quickness that sunlight and household cleaners can do in terms of killing the virus on surfaces.

he never suggested people inject a fucking thing. 

He also said
 **people would need to ask doctors about it**
as in if a blood disinfectant works.

But Is he dumb for thinking doctors have information on something yet to be proven (blood disinfectant for COVID-19) ? 
YES.
The orange turd should shut up and let Fauci explain UV blood cleansing or just keep his private curiosities between him and his team.
Dumb asses can‚Äôt comprehend his meaning because he doesn‚Äôt know how to properly express anything so they‚Äôre gonna go try to inject bleach. And of course, those who only watch sound bites and hate him, will run with it and spread the false idea that 
‚ÄúTrump said inject bleach‚Äù 


Initially I didn‚Äôt watch the entire press conference and I thought the moron was saying to inject household disinfectants. Watching the whole press conference from a conservative who linked it made me realize differently.  You should maybe try watching the whole thing.

So I think those things were talked about in private from that evidence of him not coming up with that idea.
