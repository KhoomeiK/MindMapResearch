But for PTSD flashbacks I need something stronger so I got gabapentin and use sparingly for when I’m hyperventilating and feeling like I’m having a nervous breakdown 

I would look into gabapentin over any other stronger stuff if you end up feeling like Lexapro alone isn’t cutting it. Gabapentin is  the least addictive one and in some cases not addictive at all. Doctors will say it has absolutely no chance of addiction or withdrawals but some beg to differ! Lol. It does make you feel very very tranquil and even a little sleepy. To me it’s the same feeling of taking a benzodiazepine. It lasts for a few hours too which is nice. I take 300mg only once in a day even though I’m allowed to take it 4 times a day. 
I want to keep my tolerance low. Tolerance on them shoots up fast

Good luck!"
CongratsLikeImFive,fqxx26z,t3_glk4ez,1589739161.0,"Congrats sweety!! Good for you!
I’m in therapy too and on medication.
It helps a ton! If it’s an anti-depressant that helps also with anxiety they can really help
Same for mood stabilizers

But...if it’s something like Xanax, Klonopin, or another benzodiazepine or even gabapentin, just be careful. Those are highly addictive (maybe not gabapentin but some say yes) and getting off can be a damn nightmare. I would know. I have PTSD from withdrawals. Anytime I bring it up I would cry remembering it. Also Some heroin addicts say getting off Heroin is easier than getting off benzodiazepines. I never did heroin but that scared me to know that, It can take months to stop having withdrawals is a doctor cold turkey pulls you off them. And tolerance grows rapidly. 

I’m on gabapentin for anxiety attacks
and I take them about once a week, sometimes twice. But I try to take them sparingly.

I also take an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer for my bipolar and BPD. Those are not addictive so I never skip them. They’re awesome. 

Lastly, what can help is the 4-7-8 breathing method when I’m trying to avoid using too much gabapentin

Over all I’m more of a depressed person I guess. These hypomanic days happen a few times a yr and that’s it.

But IDK about the DSM info on it.
All I know is I’ve been diagnosed multiple times as Bipolar type 2 so not sure what else I can say.
I just know I shoot to the moon with euphoria and hyper energy and talk really fast and call all my friends to gab and gab. Then I clean or watch tv and make plans and goals for my big dreams lol.
Then it all ends with slight anxiety and slight racing bad thoughts but not a real mixed episode like before. Then I just get sleepy and low grade depressed and feel disappointment and just sleep too much. I go back to feeling hopeless with lots of rumination and especially regret for calling a bunch of people, some of whom I would never have called if “sober” from hypomania.

But also my hypomania only lasts a day or 2 so not much time for damage. I usually just clean my apt, call friends because I finally sound happy, and make goals I’ll never achieve. 


How are your meds working? 
What meds are you on btw?


Maybe you can reframe things during hypomania? Because anytime I feel happy I know it’s not real and won’t commit seriously to any goals that require swiping a card or registration for something. That’s something I learned too many times the hard way. 

So if you can catch yourself with that first purchase just ask yourself 
“The last time I happily bought a ton of shit, did I ever really use it? Will I have money for rent and bills if I buy this?” 
and then wait to buy it once the hypomania fades. Because if you still want it when you’re depressed, then you might actually really need it or want it?"

If u just want strong coffee no matter how shitty it  tastes, then starbucks will do the job.

Duncan tastes so smooth and not bitter, but also not as watery and metallic tasting as most instant coffees I tried.

2)) “blames everything they do on PMS.”
You don’t seem to know how periods work. They only come once a month. So are you saying women only do bad things once a month or all day every day, for any bad behavior? No one is having PMS 365 days a year. I doubt anytime a woman is an asshole she’s like “oops PMS.” 
I have never blamed everything I “do” on PMS. 

Unless it really was PMS, because PMS is a real thing. And unless you have experienced it you wouldn’t understand it. 




3) Lies about rape happen. Not all women are good honest people. Same for men. Human nature is not a woman issue. It’s infuriating to real rape victims when anyone lies because it’s a great excuse for people who hate women to say
“see!? They’re all liars!”
It still doesn’t mean most women who claim they were raped weren’t. Most are not lying.
Rape has been an unfortunately common experience for women since time eternal and that’s a fact.
We cannot easily fight off men.
We cannot easily prove rape either.
Very hard to win rape cases period 



4) body standard are so much harsher on women.
Do u guys have companies marketing every type of makeup and diet, fashion accessory and anti aging shit on u? No. Is there reddit sub dedicated to shitting on women who have aged? Yes. r/hitthewall 

And...Do women leave their husbands for younger women once these women hit 50 and are not as attracted to their husbands? No. Most young men aren’t interested in marrying an old woman even just as a sugar momma. And why would they? Many men want a fertile hot woman or at least cute woman. Men want tight youthful skin. It’s why so many women turn to facelifts etc 
And it’s also why many married men hire escorts or have affairs with young women. The call of tight skin or whatever

it’s  been proven women are much more forgiving of looks versus men too. They did an experiment where women catfished men on a first date and vice versa. The men who got catfished looked visibly upset or annoyed or straight up just said “Wow I’m sorry but you lied to me and umm I’m not gonna stay. “ They felt entitled to the truth as they should.
The women on the other hand were nice and polite and stayed for the date. Some agreed to a second date. When interviewed later, the women said  they felt bad about judging so harshly and got won over by the man’s charm or personality or sense of humor and would be interested in another date to see. The men who got catfished however didn’t care to look past the surface. I’m sure personality and sense of humor etc matter to men too, but the women looking as beautiful as they pretended to be was what mattered first and foremost. It’s still wrong to catfish though.

I can also say I am dating a man who isn’t good looking to most women. We’re about to breakup but not due to looks. The bottom line is, it’s ok to have preferences in looks. It’s not shallow. But when push comes to shove, men like and prefer and chase hot women or younger women than themselves even as they themselves age into their 40’s and beyond and will even dump their wife for a 20 yrs younger new wife. Just look at Hollywood. How many 40-50 yr old women do you see married to a hot 25-30 yr old man? 
None or hardly any. But vice versa? So common! Who gets more plastic surgery? Women.
Women want attractive guys too, for sure.
We’re just more forgiving about looks.



5) Hahahah. No. What country do you live in? In America, many women work and enjoy doing so. Date-wise it’s between 2 people what they want to do/believe in. IMO, if a woman invites a guy out, she should pay. And if a man asks a woman out, he should pay. From there on out, it’s between them. Some men will not accept a woman paying period. It all depends.

It basically sends the message that
“You’re not worthy of love. Your parents didn’t love you and no one else will either.” 

That’s the same message they were raised with! 

That’s fucking awful to be raised to believe one is worthless and then want to be loved as an adult and now this fucking quote comes along to SHAME  those raised in abusive homes who didn’t choose that.

Fuck this quote.

People raised in abuse may need lots of counseling and may have low self esteem, anxiety and mental illness. To many they’re “damaged goods.” 

OR they might somehow be much more well adjusted by the time they want to date due to personality/resiliency or due to getting counseling before the relationship even began! 

But even if their childhood damaged them, 
 they’re no less worthy of love than a “damaged”  animal 🐶that was abused and is now re-homed  to good people Animals like humans raised on abuse,  need time to trust, needs someone to show them what love is, and to be ok calming them down when they get anxious or act out when stressed.How can we have compassion for dogs and animals but somehow humans are just worthless??

However if a person is too abusive back to the person raised in love no matter efforts to help, the person needs to leave.

Or if they don’t want to leave quite yet, 
at least they need to encourage the other to get therapy and maybe live separately until they get a good amt counseling at least. 

But all in all, if it’s too draining and much time has been invested with no results then yes leave.

I think maybe the quote actually means
“If someone is abusive don’t stay”

 To address this issue I think there should be mass amts of sites that day, with equal amts of voting sites and if a “malfunctioning machine” becomes a long running convenient excuse for voter suppression, then there needs to be free shuttle buses for inner city residents who live too far from a voting site in other areas. 


And of course most importantly, allow voting by mail in all states. 

But none of this will ever come to pass."

Americans tried to eradicate them! I mean yes Black people were slaves and it’s atrocious too, but they didn’t hate them so badly they rather them be dead. But I’m not saying they didn’t enjoy killing Black people in slavery. 

But they didn’t even care to enslave Natives in big numbers. They wanted them gone *off the face of the earth* . Till this day they hate them and it’s sad. They rarely cast them in movies too and just basically ignore them. Their reservations are not happy places at all. Lots of them suffer depression, alcoholism etc. They are completely shit on & mental health and happiness is lacking. They’re such trash to the govt they don’t even openly shit on them like racists do to others because they just don’t exist to many of them. They’re just forgotten in a weird way now.

It’s called debating. Of *course* I’m going to defend my stance and provide details lol.
That’s how it works. Hi. Welcome to reddit 👋 


Anyhow

This made up “playbook” of yours makes zero sense. I cannot fathom the level of delusion one must suffer from to think being a long time Bernie supporter who hates Trump and has comment history full of evidence somehow  *actually* means I’m a pro Trump troll. 😆How did you perform mental gymnastics to make that one have any logic to it? Do tell me. I’d love to know lol.

Oh? It’s on video that he  said
“Hey Folks go inject bleach” ? 
or 
“Can we look into injecting bleach or household cleaners into lungs?” 

No.


He said to Mr. Brian
“Could you do something **like that**?”
That is a question about finding a medically safe strong internal cure that works  LIKE the way regular disinfectants works by how swift and powerful it is against the virus. He is thinking “why can’t we have something like bleach but for internal purposes”? 


But he is dumb to have said it out loud.
It’s a wild fantasy. It is basically impossible at this time to do this and shouldn’t have been proposed out loud like that because that’s *not how viruses work*  and also his supporters are often inbred dumb ass fools who will think 
“Oh he said try Bleach!? Cool. Let me try it. “ 

I hate Trump too but I’m not going to allow my hatred to cloud reality and lose all common sense so that I don’t see what the idiot was trying to express."
PoliticalHumor,fow701s,t1_fow43xh,1588114179.0,"How am I secretly liking him or carrying a lot of water for him if I never say anything good about him? Where do I praise him? Where do I say he’s right? 

??? 😂 Wait somehow I’m a secret troll who likes Donald trump and your proof is that I praised **BERNIE**  all this year and I only talk badly about Trump? 
*That* is your proof?  Yeah you make no sense.
But It’s pretty amusing to see you do mental gymnastics to make me look like a troll though all because you can’t handle someone looking at this objectively and who is able to see what
 Shit-For-Brains Cheetoface was trying to say. 

He said it’s sarcasm because IMO he’s a lying narcissist. He looked worse trying to cover up his gaffe with a lie. But it’s Donald Trump. Do we expect apologies? 🤷‍♀️Never. He has a shitty “explanation/excuse” that he pulls out his ass for everything. He’s never wrong in his mind.

Oh you work at the White House now? We both know they  could have talked in private. No one knows when or if.  What I’m going off of is **Brian agreeing with him** at least publicly. I doubt the guy was in on any reindeer games as he seemed all business. 


Anyhow the mature thing to do would be to apologize for not explaining himself clearly and vowing to let experts handle the scientific conversations so as not to help dumb people make dumb decisions to inject bleach because they cannot comprehend what he was saying. 

But again, he’s a narcissist.

Where did he say injecting **household** disinfectant? No he did not. 
He said “can we do something like that” as in something that disinfects like that but for the lungs but not fucking household poison.
He never told Americans to inject anything at home or ever mentioned injecting bleach or lysol etc. 

But if he isn’t lying (yeah sure) and really was being sarcastic then he’s  a fucking moron. 

**And he’s also a moron even if he meant UV cleansing**  or anything of merit. He has no business talking about these things.

**Donald is a moron period** so we’re both clear

Now that you’re done reading this response where is your proof that I’m an Anti-Bernie/Pro-Trump troll? 🤔Oh wait you have nothing to go on, that’s right. Me having long responses posted doesn’t mean I like Trump, it means I’m explaining myself in detail. It’s reddit. People do that. We write a lot and debate a lot ya know. 🤷‍♀️"
PoliticalHumor,fovupww,t1_fojrtkt,1588107852.0,"First of all you’re laughably ignorant if you think I’m a troll who secretly loves Donald Trump.
Look into my history and you’ll see how much I love and adore Bernie Sanders. My heart still hurts for him and am sad Biden won. 
So do your homework before calling someone a troll. I hate Trump. Me criticizing media spin doesn’t mean I love Trump. I hate ALL media spin. They did it to Bernie. They do it to everyone.
I wish soundbites from either side didn’t exist so we all have to watch everything from beginning to end. 

Anyhow so you said 

“Anyone listening knew he wasn’t referencing some esoteric study or treatment in research stages” 

Except he was. Did you listen to the whole conference or just his viral sound bite? 
He looked at the guy and said


“ *You said you haven’t looked into that but you’re going to test it right* “? 

Clearly they had some type of private conversation. Anyone who *actually* watched the whole press conference could tell the guy behind him knew wtf he was talkings about because Trump confirmed with him

And UV blood cleansing *already exists*  as well for other things so it’s not completely fucking idiotic to wonder if hmmm maybe it could be looked into for Coronavirus.



“He literally suggested using disinfectant.” 

Oh he did? 
You mean to say he meant injecting **household** disinfectant right? 

Except he did not. 

He said
“Is there something we can do like that ?” 
Key words are
“LIKE THAT”

He never said “inject lysol and bleach at home”

Anyone with even just average intelligence can he clearly understand he meant something **medically usable**  as a disinfectant  that can disinfect the blood with the same potency and quickness that sunlight and household cleaners can do in terms of killing the virus on surfaces.

he never suggested people inject a fucking thing. 

He also said
 **people would need to ask doctors about it**
as in if a blood disinfectant works.

But Is he dumb for thinking doctors have information on something yet to be proven (blood disinfectant for COVID-19) ? 
YES.
The orange turd should shut up and let Fauci explain UV blood cleansing or just keep his private curiosities between him and his team.
Dumb asses can’t comprehend his meaning because he doesn’t know how to properly express anything so they’re gonna go try to inject bleach. And of course, those who only watch sound bites and hate him, will run with it and spread the false idea that 
“Trump said inject bleach” 


Initially I didn’t watch the entire press conference and I thought the moron was saying to inject household disinfectants. Watching the whole press conference from a conservative who linked it made me realize differently.  You should maybe try watching the whole thing.

In this case he sounded stupid and made it seem like bleach and sunlight injections were somehow real cures to try when he meant actual UV blood cleansing as is already done.

But since his ego can’t handle being wrong and sounding dumb, suddenly he meant to sound like that because “sarcasm” . Unfortunately for his dumb self, it makes him look worse. He always has an excuse for his flaws. If he was smart he’d only let doctors speak until this pandemic is over"
PoliticalHumor,foj9kqy,t1_foj8wrq,1587813747.0,"But how do you know? 
and to be fair I don’t know for sure either, but I think as I do is because he kept looking at the lady behind him for confirmation saying “you’re looking into it right?” 
To me that confirms he wasn’t the person who was curious about blood cleansing. 

So I think those things were talked about in private from that evidence of him not coming up with that idea. 


🙄But they also never told him to announce their curiosity about blood cleansing. He jumps the gun. He just says any little tidbit of conversations from anyone about anything and doesn’t realize there’s a reason these doctors aren’t up there talking about whatever curious ideas about yet to be proven treatments of blood cleansing."
