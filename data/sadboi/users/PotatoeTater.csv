Without looking at the machine, I can say that unless you have been using it since you purchased it, something could have already been wrong inside the machine; however, most likely, the machine wasn't setup balanced and the belt walked.

In addition, you can purchase a new belt, but I would get an experienced tech to assist you in installing it and checking over the machine. Belts placed into machines incorrectly will ruin themselves before you know what you did wrong.

UnresolvedMysteries,f9qepaj,t1_f9p6w6q,1575559906.0,"As some people keep saying, I'm not referring to quicksand, or literal sandpits; however, I'm referring to the collapsing method sand can undergo after moisture changes.

So as sand becomes wet, it gains strength that will allow for pits and grotto to form within the sand dunes as the wind blows.

These pits most of the time refill as sand falls and is blown about; however, when wet sand forms a tube going into the ground, it will not generally collapse back into itself until the sand is fully dried.

This can be seen on beaches when people dig holes inside the shoreline and they will stay until the sun drys out the sand and they fall in on themselves. Sometimes tho, on beaches, the tide can come up and prevent the bottom portion of the sand from drying, but the top portion drys and as the sand falls/is blown into the pit, it forms a pocket under the top layer of sand that is now dry and weaker. 

This can lead to people walking on the beach to fall into a pit when the top portion of sand isn't able to hold their weight and collapses into the moist pocket underneath.

The same can be taken into example here along the highway, with the chances of moisture runoff from the road combined with rains, this can create the possibility of ground water gathering enough to create a pocket under the sand along the road in the same consistency of a beach, capping itself off under the winds of the desert.

From here, all it takes is someone to disturb a pocket that is deep enough to bring a person below the ground level, and the dry sand on top to fall in on them, covering them up completely. 

So in all description, they didn't get swallowed up by a sandpit, but more fell into a pocket under the sand, then covered up by dry sand falling into the now uncovered pit."

conspiracy,eyj2khd,t3_cx3mum,1567111460.0,"Not suggesting anything, but when it comes to fires, this data might help some people understand things better: 

**1. Since the melting point of steel is about 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,800 degrees Fahrenheit) and the temperature of a jet fuel fire does not exceed 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,800 degrees Fahrenheit), how could fires have impacted the steel enough to bring down the WTC towers?**

In no instance did NIST report that steel in the WTC towers melted due to the fires. The melting point of steel is about 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,800 degrees Fahrenheit). Normal building fires and hydrocarbon (e.g., jet fuel) fires generate temperatures up to about 1,100 degrees Celsius (2,000 degrees Fahrenheit). NIST reported maximum upper layer air temperatures of about 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,800 degrees Fahrenheit) in the WTC towers (for example, see NCSTAR 1, Figure 6-36).

However, when bare steel reaches temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius, it softens and its strength reduces to roughly 10 percent of its room temperature value. Steel that is unprotected (e.g., if the fireproofing is dislodged) can reach the air temperature within the time period that the fires burned within the towers. Thus, yielding and buckling of the steel members (floor trusses, beams, and both core and exterior columns) with missing fireproofing were expected under the fire intensity and duration determined by NIST for the WTC towers.

**2. Was the steel in the WTC towers certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) to 1,100 degrees Celsius (2,000 degrees Fahrenheit) as some have claimed?**

UL did not certify any steel as suggested. In fact, in U.S. practice, steel is not certified at all; rather structural assemblies are tested for their fire resistance rating in accordance with a standard procedure such as ASTM E 119 (see NCSTAR 1-6B). That the steel was ""certified ... to 2000 degrees Fahrenheit for six hours"" is simply not true.

**3. NIST states that the fires in WTC 1 were generally ventilation limited. If this was the case, wouldn't the fires have burned out in about 2 minutes? Why do NIST's models show the fires burning longer?**

Nearly all fires are limited either by the burning rate of combustible fuel (fuel-limited fires) or by the availability of air (ventilation-limited fires). Many fires that are ventilation limited do continue to burn, with the burning rate determined by the chemistry of the combustion and the rate at which the oxygen arrives. This was generally the case for the WTC Tower fires. Of course, if the rate of air inflow were too slow (e.g., due to very few broken windows), the limited combustion would not have generated sufficient heat to continue pyrolyzing fuel, and the fire would have gone out. This was not the case on the fire floors in the WTC towers.

The FDS, used to reconstruct the fires in the WTC towers, included the burning characteristics of the building combustibles and the ventilation through the broken windows and the damaged building façade. The simulation showed that there were ample perforations in the building facade to maintain the ventilation-limited combustion until the fuel supply was depleted.

**4. We know that the sprinkler systems were activated because survivors reported water in the stairwells. If the sprinklers were working, how could there be a ""raging inferno"" in the WTC towers?**

Both the NIST calculations and interviews with survivors and firefighters indicated that the aircraft impacts severed the water pipes that carried the water to the sprinkler systems. The sprinklers were not operating on the principal fire floors.

However, there were ample sources of the water in the stairwells. The water pipes ran vertically within the stairwells. Moreover, there would have been copious water from the broken restroom supply lines and from the water tanks that supplied the initial water for the sprinklers. Thus, it is not surprising that evacuating occupants encountered a lot of water.

Even if the automatic sprinklers had been operational, the sprinkler systems—which were installed in accordance with the prevailing fire safety code—were designed to suppress a fire that covered as much as 1,500 square feet on a given floor. This amount of coverage is capable of controlling almost all fires that are likely to occur in an office building. On Sept. 11, 2001, the jet-fuel-ignited fires quickly spread over most of the 40,000 square feet on several floors in each tower. This created infernos that could not have been suppressed even by an undamaged sprinkler system, much less one that had been appreciably degraded."

I get the same way, I have so much stuff I can't imagine how some people go about their lives without accumulating stuff. Like my sisters house has literally nothing it in, while mine is wall to wall with shelves full of objects."
depression,etmm7wi,t3_ccaxvm,1562963141.0,"This hits so hard; I was so involved in everything. I would go out every night and spend 100% of my free time working on social events and extra activities.  


Now, I just sit at home after work and don't do any of the things that used to make me happy.  


I'm almost always overwhelmed by bills and even tho I have a decent job, it just drains me so much working it that I don't want to do anything after I'm done.   


Hell, I even lost all my friends because I felt so drained no one wanted to hang out with the buzz kill."
RBI,et66kka,t1_et5ya1j,1562505261.0,"Different type of asphalt, most single family areas are an older mix of concrete that isn't true asphalt. While yes, asphalt is used to repair cracks and breaks, the original slab isn't black top, but composite. The picture is black top asphalt, which is usually used by private companies or contractors."

Most city roads should be concrete, this leads me to believe it is most likely a house located in a home owner association as they would have the possibility of a private road crew."

UnresolvedMysteries,esk0o9i,t1_esjhw8n,1562047486.0,"Another lead you can try to follow is the mailing information, most Police Departments have rules on mailing that involves keeping the ID tags from when the package was dropped off. These are usually kept in the physical records. KCMO did some digitizing of theirs a few years back and I worked on them. We found over 600 missing items that got mailed out and disappeared only to have ended up in the USPS Atlanta Storage Center, this included some evidence that got lost in the 70s and 80s; the mailing tickets even had numbers that ended up referencing where the items would end up if unclaimed, but since some people just threw them into case boxes, they never got followed up on."
