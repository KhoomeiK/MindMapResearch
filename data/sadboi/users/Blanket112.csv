I'll definitely try Melazepam, given how out of everything I've tried, Azelaic acid seems the least irritating for my skin. Will order that tonight!

I've bookmarked that Biologique Recherche, so that'll be the next to try it this doesn't yield any results, I don't spend money going out or anything due to being so self conscious, so have no issue spending on skincare! (For better or for worse ahaha)"

Second favourite would have to be Azuma Toh, I love their watercolour style and Art Nouveau and Art Deco influence , I follow them on Twitter and they are very interested in classical art, and I love that you can tell this from their servants.

Third favourite would have to be Kususaga Rin, I've loved Atalante's designed ever since I first saw the scans of the scrapped Apocrypha MMO.

LoveIslandTV,eusmd6e,t3_cha56j,1564010406.0,"Did anyone else notice how Curtis was using the plastic baby to try and diffuse all of his awkward conversations with Maura and Anna post-argument, like, completely focusing his attention in the doll and only replying to them between making cooing sounds (probably to give himself time to think up something to say)"
grandorder,eupx6op,t3_cc7gy4,1563966246.0,"Weird coincidence, but I just finished the fight against Beowulf (Martha's summon ticket quest iirc), and I was thinking how I've literally never seen a Beowulf on my friends list and can't even remember fighting him in the story, I go and use my summon ticket, and lo and behold I end up rolling a Beowulf?!  The last three servants I've summoned have all been Berserkers!! First Lancelot, then Tamacat and now Beowulf."
grandorder,eumnvf1,t1_eumdhoh,1563918180.0,"It's probably because Atalante's FGO art/design is by Kususuga Rin/Genji Asai, the artist who originally [designed her](https://static.zerochan.net/Red.Archer.full.760156.jpg) for the cancelled Apocrypha MMO. If anything it is Ototsugu Konoe who deviated from this original design and made her slightly larger chested. Not that I mind either way, I like both of their art styles."
