news,fg75bnl,t1_fg6kgaa,1580584359.0,"I don‚Äôt know what the law on expungement is in other states for similar behavior but he will not be able to have this expunged in Arizona. We do not have expungements. He can have the conviction ‚Äúset aside‚Äù but it will always show up on a background check. So at least there‚Äôs that, I guess."
news,fg74zh9,t1_fg6f8cw,1580584129.0,"His record will not be expunged. That does not exist in Arizona. He can have it ‚Äúset aside‚Äù but it will always show up in a background check which is maybe a tiny bit comforting in this shitty situation. 
I would like to think that even though he is placed on unsupervised probation there will be some type of monitoring of his online activity due to the enormous red flag of him throwing out his computer. Not sure if I missed it or the article is silent on whether there was an investigation into the thrown out laptop. It might is still being investigated and there could be charges in the future. But then again it is PHX PD so idk how deep they‚Äôre looking into shitty and suspicious behavior or a fellow law enforcement officer."

bestoflegaladvice,fecyegf,t1_fe9n9pj,1578989754.0,Well another ‚Äúoption‚Äù is aggravated DUI for getting a DUI while his license was suspended. Dude is looking at felony charges but doesn‚Äôt seem to have realized that just yet.
bestoflegaladvice,fecy4s8,t1_fe9lz21,1578989393.0,"One of the first things I noticed. Getting a DUI while your license is suspended makes this an aggravated DUI which is a class 4 felony in Arizona. Even if he has no prior felonies and gets convicted and sentenced to probation, he will have to do a mandatory minimum of 4 months in prison as a condition of probation. 

It would be unlikely to get dismissed as a misdemeanor DUI and chances are even lower if it‚Äôs a felony DUI. 
Dude is gonna have a real wake up call after meeting with a lawyer and getting the first plea offer from the State."

Showerthoughts,f9erepg,t1_f9d5z3q,1575249569.0,I was just back in Germany and noticed that the water is at the right temperature immediately. I never gave it much thought until I moved to the US and here I have to wait forever to step into the shower after turning on the water. It‚Äôs such a waste.

coolguides,f00ighn,t1_ezyd7ws,1568302228.0,I agree that it is very rude. After having lived in a different country for many years now where people do not stare it definitely bothers me a lot more when I am back in Germany and notice people do it. I have started to look directly back at them and sometimes I wave or ask if I can help them with something.

AskMen,eyo5p2e,t3_cxsfl6,1567270309.0,"I‚Äôm a woman and did not know this was such a common thing! 

When my boyfriend and I started dating he would always change the volume in my car to an even number and I didn‚Äôt get it. He does the same with the tv. When it comes to the volume in the car he once said ‚Äúnothing bad (accident, ticket etc) has ever happened to me when the volume was on an even number.‚Äù  


So here I am now, always having my volume on an even number because I know if I‚Äôd get into an accident and the volume was on an odd number I would blame it on that stupid volume too and he‚Äôd never let me hear the end of it."

Von dem was du so beschrieben hast glaube ich sie hat wirklich psychische Probleme und braucht professionelle Hilfe. Was deine Eltern machen hilft niemandem, weil sie ihr das Gef√ºhl geben, dass ihr Verhalten okay ist und dass der Rest der Welt (vor allem anscheinend du) im Unrecht ist. 
Ich hoffe du kannst deine Hochzeit und alles was du akademisch und professionell erreicht hast genie√üen und l√§sst dich nicht unterkriegen von diesem Wahnsinn."

AskWomen,eptzn1k,t3_bvwlmt,1559500828.0,"We had one female employee who was hired as a marketing manager at a small law firm. She knew little to nothing about marketing or the legal industry. She barely did any work and others noticed. However, it was a woman who brought it to the attention of the boss and he said that all of us were just jealous of her because she is young and beautiful. Mind you, all the women working there were good looking and young (the oldest one was maybe 32). So not only did he say that we couldn‚Äôt possibly have any real complaints about this co-worker‚Äôs performance and it must be based on immature jealousy but he also implied that we weren‚Äôt as good looking as her. It was just inappropriate all around.

Funny enough she did end up getting fired once the actual numbers came in. She spent a ton on lazy and ineffective marketing campaigns that were not appropriate for our industry and our number of clients actually went down. 
Never received an apology from the boss though."
