datingoverthirty,fpklose,t3_gdxgvu,1588696902.0,"As others have expressed, inexperience in intimacy is not the main issue but the extreme rigidity with which you live your life. It is bordering on ascetic living. For solo living, sure, that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs your life, your body, go right ahead and do as you wish. However, relationships would be entirely different. There is an inherent compromise that comes in relationships. You may be hard pressed to find exactly the kind of person who will tolerate or will be into the exact same things as you, and be comfortable living in such limited ways. Is there a person out there like you? It‚Äôs possible, but a vast majority won‚Äôt be. It may be helpful to realize that two things may be truly hindering you from connecting with others: the need for control and the need for ‚Äútriggers‚Äù to cause a change. 

Control is inevitably difficult to give up, especially once you‚Äôve developed a way to use it to your advantage. It seems that it has helped you with your weight but it has been pushed to such an extreme that there is limited trust to even eat food that is not prepared by you. How do you see this relationship with food look like with a significant other? Are you just expecting someone to be exactly like you or for someone to change and adopt the same lifestyle as yours? It‚Äôs easy to feel vulnerable when we feel like we have to give up some semblance of control, but that‚Äôs also part of being in a relationship, feeling vulnerable enough to trust the other person. Before attempting a relationship with a person, perhaps trying to relinquish a bit of that control in the way you relate with food would be a good jumping off point. 

Secondly, I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs entirely healthy to subject yourself to ‚Äúharsh advice‚Äù. It seems to me that this whole idea of ‚Äútriggers‚Äù for change is basically a form of negative reinforcement. The negative attention or harsh words help compel you to change. If you want or need people to be mean to you so that you‚Äôd act on things, that seems unnecessarily cruel to yourself. It may give you a dose of reality but, at the end of the day, that‚Äôs emotionally and psychologically painful. Behavior change happens because you want to and you‚Äôre ready for it. Otherwise, no amount of negative words or harsh advice would make sense because your first instinct will be to defend your beliefs, instead of being open to the idea of change."

SuicideWatch,fn3aoyn,t1_fmz62oq,1586616750.0,"Thank you for clarifying and sharing your experience. You're right. I don't have the mental will to bypass the kind of peer pressure that you are under. It is a shitty feeling to think that everyone is against you. It's not something I would wish on anyone. I am sorry if my response aggravated or frustrated you; that was not my intention. I was merely seeking to understand more about your point of view, as well as offer another perspective, if you are open to it.

I did not say that one way of thinking is better/always right than the other/opposite. Life is not black or white. I am pointing out the gray. You are right, values guide our life and can elicit certain emotions. Personally, I think it's more a correlation than causation. It's a two-way interaction. Values lead to emotions in the same way that emotions can inform values. One is not ""more right"" than the other, but recognizing the difference on which one affects the other in certain situations is helpful. And to completely discount emotions in this regard is ignoring a big part of the equation. As I said emotional and logical thinking are inextricably linked.

We filter information through the lens of our emotions, experiences, and biases. If you had asked me two weeks ago if life is still worth living, I would have undoubtedly responded with no. My feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness made everything else look black, gloomy, and against all I believed in. Do I still get those feelings? You bet I do. Every ten minutes, every single day. Do I wake up every morning wondering and worrying what mood I'll be in today? Up or down? Heck yes. Waking up with thundering chest has been the norm for me. I can relate to the struggle between having to relentlessly choose to live or die throughout the day. Please do not think that I don't. I may never fully understand--nor would I ever claim to ""know""--what you are going through. Your experience is yours, in as much as mine is unique to me. I believe there is value in seeing other people's perspective, so we can learn from one another.

I learned my lesson the hard way. I thought a friend cared about me, only to realize that he never did. He decidedly told me never to talk to him again, after my suicidal meltdown. Because he cannot handle being the only person for whom I should live. He was right. It was a big responsibility to put on someone, anyone. But that's where my value became clear. Knowing how it feels to be alone, misunderstood, unheard, unloved, unwanted, I just needed someone to care, someone to be there when I was barely clinging to life. If I could be that one person to someone, then perhaps my life has purpose. I want to be there for people. I chose that value. That is my experience. It may have sounded like a moment of epiphany but it took years of therapy, experimenting with different interventions, constant self-doubt, countless tinkering with medications, a couple of attempts, and several career changes to even come close to being remotely ""okay"" with myself. Even then, I am nowhere near 70% there. Maybe I never will be. Who knows? But that choice to focus on that value (and identify other values that would give me a semblance of worthwhile life) was mine to make. In much the same way, you have a choice.

Now, whether or not you want to make that choice (to think that life has value) now or later is entirely up to you. There's no right or wrong. Heck, do you even want life to mean something? You're right, life itself is inherently without value. You either accept that as is or you can give it value, you can make it mean something. That decision is all yours. The timing to make that decision also matters. I am not expecting this one response to flip the switch for you. Unless you are ready for the change, the urge to resist will be strong and damn near impossible to overcome. As you are well aware, our minds are very good at holding onto strong beliefs. I do not know if/when the time will come for you, I cannot answer that. I hope it does because I wouldn't wish an aimless, meaningless life on anyone."

SuicideWatch,fmxhea3,t3_fxp68j,1586465029.0,"I'm sorry that you are going through this difficult time. It sounds to me that there are some inconsistencies in your own thinking. Please correct me if I am wrong or clarify any misunderstandings or presumptions in my response. I would like to understand what you are going through, and I can only hope that a different perspective would be of value to your struggle.

1)  ""I've heard all the arguments, nothing can convince me otherwise sadly."" Yet you are asking for advice to help you continue to live, or at the very least force yourself to study. This sounds like on some level you **CAN** be convinced, that there is something you want/need/hope to hear from others. I hope that whatever that message is, that it comes to you in some way, shape or form. You deserve to live, free from pain, hurt, and judgement.

2) ""I am wired, programmed, and convinced that suicide is logical, correct, and has purpose/value compared to everything else."" The word **convinced** is a powerful one in this statement. Our emotional and thinking brains are inextricably linked. Unfortunately, we filter a lot of our experiences through our emotional brain. Our emotional brain have been very adept at convincing our logical brain. It may feel like we are being rational, because suicide/death does make sense. Cessation of life that is painful seems not only logical but can feel necessary. After all, no one should continue to feel like hell, not when there's a way to end it all. I just want to say: the pain can end, and you can still live. 

If we really think about it logically, pain and living are not mutually exclusive. Being alive does not mean the non-existence of pain. It's part of life, if anything. Yet our emotional brain has convinced us really well that this is too much for us to bear, that the only way out is to die. On some level, I reckon you recognize this because you said, ""I can bypass/ignore this peer pressure, **but if I do, I'm dead.**"" That tells me that you are not really ""100% motivated"" to commit suicide. There is some part of you that is finding a way not to do it, to still make sense of the situation. For me, it has helped to focus on that tiny bit of doubt, that small cloud of hope, and distract myself with anything that would help me get through the day. Be it sleep, a bath, a walk, listen to a song, watch a movie, eat a favorite snack. Do something for yourself, enough to get your mind off the suicidal ideation. Maybe that will help get you to focus on your studies. Emotional pain has a life span of about 10-20 minutes. It turns into a mood (persistent feeling) because of ruminating thoughts. You can set a simple goal to break the downward spiral of your thoughts, in whatever way that works for you. Music has been helpful for me lately.

It's a very confusing and overwhelming time, I can relate to that. Just know that there are people who care. I know how it felt to be abandoned when I needed help the most. If I can be of help, I would like to be there until you're okay."
SuicideWatch,flos0cw,t1_floaw30,1585344291.0,"That‚Äôs true. The pain can feel so overwhelming. It can, at times, feed into the thought-feeling-action cycle, making it feel even more unbearable. It was powerful for me to know that the mind actually cannot distinguish between physical and emotional pain. The same parts in the brain are activated whether you burn your hand or you break up with someone. As cliche as it sounds, I do believe time heals. Easier said than done, and I hear you when you say you‚Äôre tired. It can feel so exhausting, so indescribably draining. As if every effort was meaningless and ultimately futile. That‚Äôs our brain feeding into the negative loop. I‚Äôm not here to say just think good thoughts, things will be okay. I still struggle with this myself. It‚Äôs an active process to want the change and keep at it, despite the negativity blaring in my head. 

It also helped me to know that feelings only really last up to 20 mins. That was eye opening to realize that the reason it persists is the way I feed into the negativity. Unlike others, I don‚Äôt think sprinkles and rainbows. That‚Äôs the last thing I can think of when I‚Äôm in that moment. But distraction buys me time, it allows me to take a step back, to breathe and calm my hyperactive mind down. Does it always work? Hell no.

I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre diametrically opposed. Both just highlights the importance of being loved. One emphasizes that if you love yourself, the need to find affection from others will be significantly less. The other statement just shows that even if you don‚Äôt believe or find yourself worthy of love, you still deserve it.

If anything, I see it more as a step. The second statement comes first. You deserve to be loved, even if you don‚Äôt believe it. Because the way you approach yourself mirrors your actions towards others. So it makes it sense to love yourself first, believe in it and internalize it, so that others can see the confidence in you and be attracted to the kind of security you have within yourself."

To answer your question, is this particular type lifestyle worth fighting? Depends on whether following that type of life is important to you. It used to be for me. But I have to resign myself to the fact that‚Äî at near 40‚Äì I may have to switch careers, I may have to start over, I may never even be in a relationship, let alone have a family. It may take me a long time to be financially stable. I may have to deal with my depression forever. Do I still struggle with accepting that? Do I envy ‚Äî at times even resent‚Äî people who seemed to have it easier? Yes, it‚Äôs normal. But I go back to thinking about what can I do for myself.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of parents are not aware of the effect their own behaviors have on their kids. Many think that sending their kids to tutoring or therapy will miraculously cure their kids, but it takes time and rapport to explain to them that their kids did not develop those anxious behaviors out of nowhere, and it‚Äôs a struggle to get parents to admit that they may have a hand in making their kids anxious, and/or depressed in some instances."

unpopularopinion,fke4hml,t1_fkdfc77,1584104945.0,"The ripple effect is significant, I get that. But blaming the person for not reporting only makes things worse for all involved. It invalidates the person‚Äôs real struggle from the trauma, at the same time it infuriates those on the sidelines who see the quiet perpetuation of the main issue.

datingoverthirty,fkddhz2,t1_fkb7cj3,1584075071.0,"Oh, good! I have a tendency to overshare and get really verbose. But yes, a cuddling website! It‚Äôs called Cuddle Comfort. I agree, I only tried it because curiosity got the best of me, but,in the end, it just felt weird to be around someone in such close proximity and an intimate embrace without having any feelings involved. Weirdly, what drew him to me was he didn‚Äôt make the first move for physical contact. I appreciated that because it takes me a while to warm up to people. Then again, in hindsight, aside from the kisses, I initiated most of the physical contact like cuddling, hand holding, arm over shoulder/arm around waist. Not that it matters now, but I definitely would have liked it if he started to take on the initiation of some physical contact. Oh well!

And you‚Äôre welcome for the clarification. The whole thing just caught me off guard because my intention was not to date, yet expectations were already different between the two of us. On top of the communication incompatibility later on, I didn‚Äôt want to waste anymore time. I would have been fine with casual dating but effort should match words. Otherwise, it just triggers my anxiety as I start to question things. I have no problem broaching, I just need the casual and lighthearted words to use."
insaneparents,fkdckcr,t1_fkbgp4n,1584074265.0,"I get what you‚Äôre saying but I‚Äôve worked directly with physically abused and maltreated children and had to provide family therapy to reunify the kids with their parents. You said so yourself, some children grow up fine, while others don‚Äôt. Different protective factors play huge roles into how well adjusted a person who was spanked develops. But in my experience as a therapist, at the root of most my clients issues are violent parenting. Just because hitting ‚Äúworks‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean we have to keep doing them, when there are equally effective strategies that do not harm the child‚Äôs self-esteem and relationship with their parents. I‚Äôve also worked with domestic violence survivors, the kids end up abusing their own children because it‚Äôs what they learned. If you have the option of violent strategies that would benefit half kids who adjust fine (the other half developing life long issues) versus positive strategies that would benefit all kids, shouldn‚Äôt the choice be clear?"
insaneparents,fkdbrg7,t1_fkbwgxv,1584073617.0,"You also brought up a very good point about the degradation of trust and communication. On top of the fact that it‚Äôs hard to reconcile someone who supposedly loves and cares about you as also the one who hits you, it does not necessarily help promote open communication. It baffles me when parents decry that their teenagers don‚Äôt talk to them anymore or hide things from them, especially when they tell me that their parents hit them, too, and now they don‚Äôt talk or barely have any relationship with their own parents.

insaneparents,fkdaqmv,t1_fkanzj1,1584072805.0,"Exactly this! It builds resentment between parents and kids.

Yes, I had a need to spend more time with him that he was not meeting. However, I didn‚Äôt tell him that I need at least two dates a week or any such number. My schedule is variable,  and I cannot make him commit to that, if I can‚Äôt do it either. I have asked to meet up a couple of times and he said he‚Äôs tired and preferred to cuddle instead. We met on a platonic cuddling website. I said I was fine with anything and, still, he didn‚Äôt ask to meet up. 

I do really like the idea of being upfront about where you are with things and specifically including needs and expectations, for clarity‚Äôs sake. I thought I was communicating well, but it‚Äôs clear I still have much‚Äîoh, so much‚Äî to learn. :)"
datingoverthirty,fkb5slb,t1_fk91wvk,1584026690.0,"Thank you, I really appreciate hearing a guy‚Äôs perspective on this. 

Just to clarify, we didn‚Äôt meet at an OLD app. It was through a platonic cuddling website, which explicitly states that it‚Äôs not a dating website. I also distinctly remember him saying on the first date that it‚Äôs not a date. So, it wasn‚Äôt until after the third date when he kissed me that I started to wonder if there was more to things. But I still didn‚Äôt think much of it, acted casually, and we went out a couple more times, which were my idea. But I could tell something was different as the quality of conversations decreased after that third date. Just wanna add that, on that third date, he encouraged me to go on Tinder and meet people. I playfully refused because it‚Äôs not my thing.

At some point I did point out the decrease in conversation and ask if he was still interested. He gave me a non-answer that he enjoys doing fun things with people and that future thinking isn‚Äôt his thing. I clarified that I wasn‚Äôt asking him to commit or to be exclusive, just if the interest is still there; otherwise, I‚Äôd rather know now than be ghosted. He said he had no intention of ghosting me and that he thought he was showing his interest through accepting my invites to meet up. This was two months in and five meet ups. That‚Äôs when I clarified if those meet ups were dates. I was perfectly fine if he had said otherwise; but he confirmed that ALL of them were dates. I apologized for any mixed signals I sent. I half hoped he would apologize, too, simply because, if I had to ask to clarify, it means he had a role in my confusion because communications were crossed. Nevertheless, I didn‚Äôt push the issue and carried on as usual. 

Then a week passed, we went out again. Things were fine. He was the one telling people we‚Äôre dating. I didn‚Äôt force him to say it. When I casually I said I missed hearing more from him, he did try to text more. But something was already off. I picked my battles and decided not to belabor the issue. But two weeks since the last date, I made efforts to meet up, he would say he‚Äôs tired and just want to cuddle. On our last conversation, I even specifically said I‚Äôm fine with doing anything. Still, he didn‚Äôt ask to meet up. At this point, I was tired of it. If you say you‚Äôre interested and yet make no attempts to meet up, then I‚Äôm out. So I told him, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt for me. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any intent on meeting up anymore. I don‚Äôt fancy being strung along.‚Äù Left it at that and promptly blocked him without waiting for another noncommittal response. 

It‚Äôs not like I was asking him to go out every week.  Even when we did, we alternated paying so I‚Äôm not ‚Äúusing‚Äù him or anything. But if you say we‚Äôre dating, tell people as such, and say you‚Äôre interested, then I expected some forward movement. But conversations were forced and stale at best and he no longer seemed keen to meet up. When I blocked him on the cuddle website, I saw that he checked it 12 hrs prior. I could not care less whether or not he was in contact with someone else. I was ready to peace out.

I‚Äôm so sorry this turned into a novel! Oops... üòü"

Point being, once you cross that line and feel yourself justified for hurting your own child, where do you draw the line and stop? Moreover, what does that teach the child? That hitting is okay? That violence is acceptable between loved ones? There are non violent ways to discipline and promote behavior change that still asserts the parents‚Äô control and authority."

I just need to learn to bring things up when I‚Äôm actually calm, not wait until I‚Äôm so fed up, that I‚Äôm so irritated at the person. 

As for your last point, I agree it is indicative of incompatibility. He was open that he was anxious-avoidant. And have seen how noncommittal he is about things, when I asked about still being interested. However, he also did try to increase communication when I brought it up, so it showed some effort was being made. But then the lack of intention in meeting up just left me annoyed. If you say we‚Äôre dating, then there‚Äôs an unspoken expectation that there should be some semblance of progress after six dates, especially if you say you‚Äôre still interested. I even communicated that I wasn‚Äôt looking for commitment or exclusivity right away, yet the communication was dissonant from the actions. If he had said we weren‚Äôt dating, I would have been completely fine with us just spending time when convenient. Labels matter."
