Does your partner have any other medical related anxieties, maybe? Maybe exploring coping mechanisms specifically for medical phobias might help. Ex:  I find keeping pregnancy tests in the house helpful, because I feel like I can check whenever I need to. Having that as a security blanket helps relieve some of my anxiety, which then gives me the extra mental room/energy I need to deal with the root of the problem.
