When somebody has even a slightly different opinion, it becomes a fucking competition to see who's the ""real"" leftist or whatever. You can't be sociable or respectful even on the internet, where you literally have infinite time to craft a response that doesn't sound like it came from a petulant toddler who just found out their friend won't share their gummies with them. 

And yet this is the norm, instead of the exception. When we don't defend our ideas, when we just attack the character of the people raising criticisms of them, it's only setting us back. And I don't know if you've read up on Socialist theory or if you're just trying to be a new age edgelord, but Socialism is founded in the idea that *nobody* is less valid than anybody else, and society is made up of a *community,* not by one single facetious asshole who supposedly follows Socialist ideology. If you were making an honest argument against their ideas, that would be one thing. But you're not. You accuse them of being a liar, and then when they're understandably bewildered by your strange and aggressive tone, you hit them with the ""ok boomer"" or equivalent. Which, contrary to what your 15 year old stoner cousin will tell you, is not a valid piece of dialogue. 

In short, everything about your posts embodies the fucking disappointment of modern Socialist activism. There are so few people willing to speak in defense of socialism, that if you can't say anything that isn't some vapid insult, you're better off just not saying anything. It's arguments like these that make our cause look even less valid than fucking Conservatism to people who might otherwise be valuable allies to the cause."

overthegardenwall,fjdgid8,t3_fcwgtk,1583252490.0,"Okay, this question is actually more complicated than it looks. On the one hand, the setting is based on a sort of semi-formed idea of American nostalgia, romanticizing the ideas of the early American settlement in the 'Unknown World' without romanticizing the actual... you know, *conquering* that took place. In that sense, it takes cues from throughout the 17th-19th centuries. You can see this throughout the show; episode one, the clothing of the skeleton pumpkin people was typical of 16th century Danish settlers*.

On the other hand, its setting is in early 1980s USA, which you can see in the finale when they wake up to their modern life.

As for the art, it was inspired by classic American artwork by artists like the McLoughlin Bros, Gustave Doré, and John Tenniel, who made board games in the late 1800s, illustrated for *Don Quixote*, and illustrated for *Alice in Wonderland* respectively. 

Joel McHale also used references from vintage Halloween postcards and magic lanterns, which were like a toy projector that were made and used between the 18th-20th centuries. I *think* (but don't know for sure) that they were the predecessor to the film projector, but you should look that up before you quote me on it.

*16th century danish clothing: look I'm not a historian, please correct me if I'm fudging this a little bit. I'm reaching back like 12 years to my high school research in this subject so my memory might not be perfect."
