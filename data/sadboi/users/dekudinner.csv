Story time, kinda related. I have PCOS too, so I already have a little bit of a belly. When I was 15 my mom and grandfather died in the same year, months apart. I became very depressed, and gained even more weight. One week I had to stay with my bible thumping, judgmental aunt because my dad was out of town. I had a counselor that came to see me every week. I was talking to my counselor about my weight gain and pain due to PCOS. Apparently my aunt was listening in to our conversation and only heard me talk about weight gain and pain because the next morning she came in and gave me a pregnancy test. She told me “I’ve seen bloating before, but never THAT bad.” She then went on to to give me some lecture about how she’s done acid and pot so she knows what it’s like to be a rebellious teenager??? I had never had sex at this point, so I obviously wasn’t pregnant, but I’m the “black sheep” of the family so it’s easy to assume I guess. I very stupidly took the test anyway. I’m almost 21 now and every time I see her I wish I would have told her the fuck off."
