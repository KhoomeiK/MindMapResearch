I got 5 unipolar ECTs and as an outpatient, lamictal, in 2011. A few years later, 2013, I felt as good as it gets, and that is the way it has been.  I still become clinically depressed at times, but I can sometimes alleviate the severity by taking 600 to 800 mg of lamictal daily for a few days."

Then my psychiatrist switched me to depakote, (valporic acid), as research showed it was more effective, safer, and no testing.  As for the theraputic effect of mood stabilizing, they both worked the same for me.  After my psychiatrist died suddenly, I had three or four psychiatrists. The fourth one, put me back on lithium, and I had lithium poisoning!  Diagnosed by a young ER physician.  To make along story short, I was at this point in my life a physical and mental wreck. Was forced into a disability retirement at age 54 after 21 years service, and after thus,  on my own, I cold turkey stopped the 8 or 9 psych meds I was on for bipolar. What happened then?  Quitting a cornucopia of psych meds, after taking them for 14 years, at times I was more mentally ill then the mental illness I was  being treated for. A few involuntary hospitalizations, and in the interim, having a roller coaster emotional and physical life, I stuck to my guns though, as this existence was way better then being a chemically lobotomized subhuman.  After about 2 years of my cold turkey program, I lapsed into a clinical depression so severe, for about six months, finally I went to the ER, was admitted, and had 5 consecutive unipolar ESTs.  It worked. I only take 300mg of lamictal now, and in the fall/winter, will usually become clinically depressed, in conjunction with getting a long term low grade upper respiratory illness. Augmentin helps. This year, I became depressed in Nov. 2019, and it lasted until early March 2020. I come out of the depression into covid lockdown. lol.  However, I went cold turkey in May 2010, because I had nothing to lose, and was very dissatisfied with psychiatry.  Robert Whitaker's book, Mad In America, certainly reinforced my attitude.  Everybody is different, that is my story, and I thank you for allowing me to tell it, and I hope my opinion of lithium vs depakote is helpful."
