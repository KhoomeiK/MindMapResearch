AskReddit,fkwuy4v,t3_fksy04,1584606948.0," Idk if this really qualifies, but here it is. (Random names)

I’m fourteen, a freshman, my friend, we'll call him Mark is seventeen, he’s been there for me in the past when I needed someone, so when he texted me,

“Hey I’m really weird, so if I’m ever too weird, just let me know.”

I didn’t think too much of it, I simply replied with,

“We’re all weird in our own way, so don’t worry about it, you can be comfortable with me.”

He said something like, “Okay cool.” and proceeded to ask me a question,

“Does your little brother ever annoy you?”

To which I replied, “Yeah all the time.”

He then asked me if I wanted to know some ways I could get back at him, to which I agreed to because why not?  
This is when started to get weird. He gave me these, “challenges” for me and/or my little brother. Weird things like: *You should have your little brother drink a crap ton of water and then tell him he can’t use the bathroom or else he loses, and make sure you watch him and stop him from going to the bathroom.*

Or:

*When your brother is sleeping you should go into his room and take off all his clothes and leave him like that, wouldn’t it be funny to see his reaction in the morning?*

Or:

*You should take all of your brother’s underwear out of his drawer and hide it.*

Then he started asking me questions:

*Have you ever seen your little brother naked?*

*Has your little brother ever seen you naked?*

*Would you ever take a shower with your little brother? It would be a great bonding experience.*

*Have you ever tried to stop your little brother from going to the bathroom?*  
*Have you ever used the bathroom outside?*

This wasn’t all at once, all the “challenges” and questions were over about a week span. During this week, I was scared, I was uncomfortable, I didn’t know what to do. 

He wouldn’t stop, every day he would text me, many times a day:

*Indeed\_I\_Am\_627? Did you do the challenges? Get online girly. Are you busy? Did you do it? Indeed\_I\_Am\_627??*

With my anxiety, I was too afraid to ask him to stop, especially when I had just told him he could be comfortable around me. So I stopped being online as often, I started texting back short answers.

“Sorry I’ve been busy, I didn’t do it, I fell asleep early last night.”

“*Well, are you going to do it tonight? You should.”*

Again this went on for a week, every day, throughout the whole day. I told a few close people I trust, including my friend James. 

James is also seventeen, he’s a good friend of mine and he means a lot to me. I showed him screenshots of what was happening, and he wanted to text Mark himself and make him stop since I couldn’t do it on my own, but I wouldn’t let him, I was too scared of the outcome.

A few days later, in a group chat with a majority of my home school friends, Gauge who is thirteen, sent a screenshot in the chat, it was of Mark, texting him the same things he had been texting me. James was also in that group chat, James is Gauge’s older cousin. 

Of course, James freaked out and started blowing up my phone,

“YOU SEE, HE’S NOT JUST HARASSING YOU, HE’S HARASSING MY COUSIN, YOU CAN’T STOP ME FROM TEXTING HIM NOW!”

I knew no amount of pleading with him not to wouldn’t work this time, it wasn’t just me this time, it was his cousin. I asked him NOT to say ANYTHING about me, and only about his cousin. He didn’t listen. 

He sent me screenshots of conversations between him and Mark, in which he said MANY things, that I don’t think is appropriate for me to type or say out loud, but he basically told Mark to F off, and stop with his challenges crap, because he was being disgusting. Mark didn’t realize I had told James about everything, so when James told him to leave me alone too, he was surprised and private messaged me,

*Did you tell Gauge’s cousin about this? Whatever I’m going to unfriend you because James doesn’t want me talking to you.*

James and I explained to Gauge everything that happened, and he was shocked as well. Gauge and I had known Mark for a while and neither of us had expected it. James didn’t want me talking to Mark ever again, and quite frankly, I wasn’t interested in talking to him at that time. When everything went down, I had a major anxiety attack and I just wanted to feel safe. Even though it was all online, the whole thing made me feel deprived of safety and security.

I tried to forgive the Mark and be friends with him, but he ended up doing this again, so i blocked him and i have no intentions of talking to him ever again"

I never eat school lunch, so I was waiting for him and our friends to get to our table, my sleeve was rolled up a bit, I hadn't noticed. When he got there we said hi and whatever, when he put his tray down he glanced at my arm.

He looked at me and said, ""Hey fam, if you don't mind me asking, what are those ?"" And gestured to my arm. I didn't know what to say so I kinda just rolled my sleeve down and looked away. He was still standing, but he wrapped his arms around me and rested his head on mine. He asked if he needed to hug me forever, (at this time I liked him, but hadn't told him)

I said, ""its not like you can follow me to my house."" to which he replied with, ""well why wouldn't I ?""

I told him not to worry about me but he said, ""I am worried, your my friend.""

Our friends got to the table by that time, so the subject was dropped. The next morning though, he brought my gauze, which really meant a lot to me.

for the love of God, NEVER punish him for self-harming

I've been through this with my parents, 2 years ago when I was 12 they found out.

They would beat me every time they saw new cuts, I was Cinderella as they had me clean the whole house from top to bottom, I mean like getting on my hands and knees scrubbing every tile, to ""distract me""

They took away my phone, I had to completely ghost all my friends, everyone that cared about me, which really just made things worse.

They made me sleep in their room, on the floor to ensure I wouldn't go cut.  
I wasn't allowed to wear sleeves, wasn't allowed to close my door, or the bathroom door.  
Was NEVER allowed alone.

If I even LOOKED upset, they'd freak out.

So I had to, ""get better"" with no help, I wasn't allowed to talk about it because,

""You have no reason to be depressed, why are you cutting, people do that when they are abused or something. Your our good christian daughter, stop that.""

And so I stopped cutting my arms, and moved to my legs.

Now here I am, 14 and suicidal, with cuts up and down my arms.

Don't make him show you his injuries, don't tell him, ""Don't do that."" Don't make him talk about it if he doesn't want to.
