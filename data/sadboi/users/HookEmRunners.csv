Not everyone wants to be a homeowner.

If it wasn’t for me offering to rent my house to them, they would have had a smaller pool of rental houses from which to select, and the law of supply and demand tells us that when there’s less rental homes on the market, the price of rent goes up.

In other lines of business, companies hold tons of debt and go bankrupt for all kinds of reasons. It’s not a moralistic thing, but for some people real estate is personal and the character of the landlord or investor is at stake if they take on “too much” debt, whatever that is.

RealEstate,fmi9ozk,t1_fmhe3h8,1586105231.0,"I agree that landlords need to be flexible and work with their tenants if they need it right now. Trust me when I say that many large apartment complexes, for example, aren’t offering any degree of flexibility to their tenants. One of the things I like about being a mom-and-pop property owner is my ability to be the landlord I want to see in the world.

And wow, I didn’t know Florida’s UI benefits were so paltry. Here in Texas, the maximum weekly benefit is about twice that, so my sympathies go out to you.

It’s not that I think tenants should sacrifice rent over food, but they should not be using this as a “get out of jail free” card for paying all rent. 75-50% rent if faced with an insurmountable hardship? Sure. 0% rent for more than one month, when all this money is pouring in from the SBA and federal government? I’m less convinced. Sure, it may take some time to reach the average Joe, but again, we should be waiving all late fees right now.

As a landlord, my bank does not care if I’m faced with an insurmountable hardship; they don’t give a damn about whether I was just laid off, to be frank. The fact that I can turn around and treat others better than I am myself treated is a wonderful opportunity for me to do the right thing.

So, TL;DR: tenants and landlords need to work with each other in a compassionate and understanding way right now. I’d expect my tenants to take an honest look at cash flow and prioritize rent (housing) above almost everything else outside of food and immediate necessities. Food and shelter are the two main line items we all need to be safeguarding right now.

Edit: You should qualify for unemployment, because the program was already broad for W2 workers and is even broader now that it includes literally anyone suffering from a COVID19-related loss of income. Timing is trickier, though, so I agree there. The treasury dept. is talking about people with DD on file with the IRS being able to receive their $1.2k this week, but who knows."

From his perspective, he may feel very alone and isolated if he doesn’t know many people in this new city and is unable to quickly find a successful job like you.

Best of luck to you both."

But no, this is actual theft."

RealEstate,fiz99zz,t1_fiyqj80,1582857173.0,Can you call back and insist on filing a missing person’s report? It seems negligent of a police officer to refuse to take information that could be critical if there was indeed foul play.

RealEstate,fhcqth1,t3_f2b15l,1581468828.0,"The big reason properties appreciate is inflation. There are other reasons but this is the biggest when looking at the macroeconomy.

Inflation varies wildly year-over-year, but an average annual rate of 3.5% is commonly cited. The overall, average appreciation of real estate is largely tied to this figure.

This may seem like a dismal ROI but your returns can outpace inflation through leverage. While a property may only appreciate, say, 3.5% in one year, if you have $7k of equity in a $200k property, you made another $7k in one year—a 100% return on your investment. This is a simple example for illustrative purposes."
RealEstate,fh7xc68,t1_fh6y4ol,1581347123.0,"I know this is r/RealEstate, but there are other ways to invest besides real estate, and with the price-to-rent ratio being what it is in California, it may make sense to rent forever and stash your money away in a Vanguard IRA if you are renting for $500/month.

Rent in CA is high, but purchasing a house is much, much higher. Consider the price-to-rent ratio and your need for mobility between cities in the future. The prospect of sky-high future appreciation in already high cost-of-living areas is not a given."

financialindependence,fgux1fk,t3_ew75cf,1581131351.0,"People don’t want to think their doctors are the ones screwing them, so they blame insurance for our failed healthcare system. In reality, it’s a tug-of-war between providers and insurance companies, and guess who’s the one trying to screw you with an insanely high medical bill.

Edit: I say this as a supporter of universal health insurance. Insurance companies are not perfect, but you can’t make healthcare affordable for everyone without addressing the predatory practices of providers and hospitals that charge insane rates to the average consumer."
GymMemes,fgn6zft,t3_ezfak8,1580938884.0,"Very few people have actual issues with their metabolism. For the vast majority of people it isn’t even an exercise problem—even hard days at the gym will only burn a few hundred calories (unless you’re running miles and miles of cardio). For most of us it’s too many calories in and, to a lesser extent, calories out.
