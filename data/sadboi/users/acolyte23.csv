kdramarecommends,fqzpypd,t1_fqz950m,1589772724.0,"When it was aired a lot of people were disappointed cos most are rooting for JH. I actually feel the same way. But basing on the characters‚Äô story, Taek was more persistent than JH. I don‚Äôt know the trend that you speak of since I‚Äôve only seen 1988. 

In the original script, JH dies of plane crash (based on a true story in 1995). In that true story, the pilot has a brother with a heart disease, just like JB. In the supposed airport scene, DS and JH will kiss. During the crash, JH will have flashbacks of his memories with his first love, DS. After hearing the crash, JH‚Äôs mom faints, and JB will have a heart attack. DS comes back from Japan, Taek cancels a match, and the hood grieves. The moms cry and hug each other, while the dads drink together. 

The narration goes something like, ‚Äúthe ones we love will not be with us forever. Someday they will leave us.‚Äù

DS and Taek go to JH‚Äôs grave and inform him of their marriage. In their wedding, they leave an empty chair for JH. Bora also marries SW. The ending is pretty much the same, the families leave the hood one by one. This is only a summarized version. 

The writers had to cut out the accident scene, which they planned from the very beginning because a politician leaked the ending on social media. That‚Äôs why episode 17 onwards were delayed. 

A lot of people were also disappointed because of JH‚Äôs ending (the aired one). He just disappears when he played a major role in the storyline, and the writers had to change the script in the ending. But DS and Taek really are meant to be together from the beginning, as the actors said in the interviews."

Para hindi ka rin palaging nattrigger at galit in the same environment. 

If you have money for professional help, go for it as well. Baka mas makatulong sa pamumuhay mo. Again, I‚Äôm so sorry that this is happening to you. 

No judgment here. As a matter of fact, ganyan din ang mga nararamdaman ko nung 2017. Galit na galit ako sa isang tao, to the point na gusto ko rin pumatay out of betrayal. I‚Äôve planned all the ways I could kill him. Of course, hindi ko ginawa. But in my head ang dami kong naiisip. Feeling ko baliw na baliw ako sa galit. Gusto kong gumawa nang masama just for the sake of revenge. I ended up seeing a psychologist, and my doctor diagnosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder. 

I would also tell you to try your best to catch yourself no matter how hard it is. It is very very difficult. Especially pag kinakain ka na ng galit mo. And don‚Äôt do it. Wag kang gumawa nang masama. Maniwala ka na magiging mas mabuti yung sitwasyon at buhay mo. Hindi man ngayon, pero sa susunod na panahon. But you have to do things differently if you want change (like getting your own place for your own sanity).

I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt much help. I hope that you will have better days ahead. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to chat me if you need someone to talk to."

C. I can‚Äôt really answer this for you. 
D. Do your best in the exam, and make sure that your current grades are at least above average.

I feel like my hard work as a designer is invalidated (altho i know this isnt the case and the point) parang it just feels that way and i just really feel defeated cos he had it easier. Pero that‚Äôs really how it is, but it won‚Äôt stop me naman from working hard!"

Oo triggered na triggered ako kaya nga napa post ako eh. Nakakatawa naman na apektado ka sa crisis ko??? HAHAHAH may post ka pa tungkol sakin sorry pero wala akong pake sayo lmao
Philippines,f0lc99s,t1_f0l6s53,1568710027.0,Not his fault at all. Haha i didn‚Äôt mean to come off as bitter pero galit ako and super triggered yes because some people have it way easier and ganon talaga siguro haha super triggered lang

Hindi naman ako galit sa success that was handed to him, cause thats really how it is. Haha more of frustrated lang cos he had it easy and ang minimal ng effort niya compared to other people. Like what i said, ganun talaga yung life haha"

Putang ina ka, sobrang bilis at dali lang sayo ng lahat dahil inabot yan sayo ng magulang mo sayo. Hindi ka designer, entrepreneur ka, at wala kang alam sa larangan ng sining at debuho. Paano kaming naghihirap sa art school? Naghihirap pumasa sa board exam para magka lisensya? Sobrang unfair ng buhay. Yung iba, tatanggapin na lang yung binigay ng magulang tapos okay na, samantalang kami, handang gumapang para lang may marating sa industriya na to. We literally have to put ourselves out there, para lang may tumingin samin, tapos yung iba, inabutan lang ng furniture business, tinawag na yung sarili na furniture designer. Galit na galit talaga ako. Ok bye"

I don‚Äôt think that the Sanchez case which Manuel brought up during the hearing is highly irrelevant.  it‚Äôs germane to the hearing esp that Sanchez & his private army‚Äîcomposed of PNP Calauan‚Äîwere the ones involved in the UPLB students rape-slay case. Anong silbi ng pagbabalik ng ROTC kung mga mismong kapwa-sangay ng AFP ang perpetrators sa krimen? Sigurado ba tayong gusto natin ng ROTC, at ganyang mga uri ng tao ang namumuno? Hmm. Relevant siya sa issue.


‚ÄúI just hope that the sectors who believe that ROTC should be abolished could come up with more rational arguments supported by data, as this tarnishes whatever cause they stand for.‚Äù ‚Äî- MANUEL DID. BUT Y‚ÄôALL ARE NOT READY FOR THAT CONVERSATION."
