-2:22 I love you (meaning my loved one who I’m thinking of at the moment, or person I’m manifesting)

Etc.

AskReddit,fr149q7,t3_glugf8,1589812966.0,"I work at an adult gag/joke store that also sells sex toys. I nearly shrieked when this stereotypical fuckboy walked in asking if he could use used toys (namely insertable ones) he bought for his ex-gf on his new fwb. He told me that in a “hypothetical situation/asking for a friend”. I flat out told him it is unsanitary and he should just buy cheap toys for every new woman coming into his life so he wasn’t draining his wallet every time. Our products are fairly cheap, we have three different lines for three different price points.

He retorted that “what if I/he sanitized it really good” , I don’t remember if he explained how he cleaned it but I assumed not properly. I reminded him gently how sensitive vaginas are, the risk of sti/stds, and proper cleaning for toys.  

We were flirting before this question (we’re both 20+), it got personal and we talked about personal toy usage. I just got out of a horrible fwb situation so it was an ego boost and he was attractive. I dropped the thought of getting his social media/number after that initial question, the way he was talking sounded like he wanted to cut corners with a serious thing which is a red flag in my book. He was emphasizing on how expensive the toys he brought his ex and the quantities. I don’t doubt he was actually not sure but I couldn’t get the thought out of my head that he could’ve used a used sex toy on me.

TLDR: Fuck boy wanted to repurpose an old sex toy for his ex gf on a new fwb."

I’ve realized that some of those negative thoughts are me searching for the wrongs, Ex: “what if this is secretly 3ps reddit and she’s taking about him?” 

I’ve been working on staying mindful and keeping that constant shrug off with the occasional negative thoughts. I accept the thought, let it pass, and discover at a later time why I thought that. Sometimes when I do get anxious about something negative, I end up in a spiral thinking that “well now *negative thought* gonna happen because I’m paying too much attention to it”.

nevillegoddardsp,fj0qazj,t1_fiuixqq,1582905560.0,"Thank you for your insight, I’m sorry it took me eons to get back to ya. You def have a new subscriber here. The first video on self love really hit hard, especially when you were talking about your weight loss. The hearing of “LOVE YOURSELF” is very vague and gives me a feeling of being stuck in a river without a paddle. I definitely agree with you there, it’s not as helpful as people think. I don’t accept the way I am, I’m currently trying to lose weight, but also if I don’t hit the goal weight or if I overeat I’m not going hate myself and give up. I’m going to get back on the horse and revaluate my choices. Weight loss is for my personal choice and learn reasons. 

Previous SPs I’ve had were definitely a hard knock on my ass to learn how to love myself and not to rely my happiness on them. I wish I learnt that the first time but I think it’s par the course of dating in your 20s. Ive definitely sunk into those thoughts of “if I don’t do XYZ for myself then I won’t manifest ____” usually it’s within my depression ruts. It‘s sometimes triggers a panic mode of “now I’m never going to manifest ____” but I’ve caught myself a few times. I have remind myself to accept the now and focus on the little things to get myself better and what can I do to improve myself. I got weekly therapy who’s open to my beliefs and encourages meditation and yoga. 

The thing that does confuse me with LOA is the whole “forget” your SP, a lot of people say letting go is surrendering your doubts to the universe, some say forgetting the SP completely(no more visualization, set and forget), some also say to keep up visualization, or just let go of the desire (it’s cool if it was mine but it’s not something I absolutely need). I’m not sure if I’m ready to let go, it’s hard because my SP is a musician and I do love enjoy his music. I did tone how often I listen to his music down compared to binge listening. I’ve been visualizing for a few months now, I’m not sitting here thinking “where is it?”, I’m personally not ready yet but if it comes it comes."

nevillegoddardsp,fiugf50,t3_f9s7mg,1582740914.0,"Your video really hit close to home, I’ve been manifesting someone who I haven’t met (yet) for awhile. This SP is one of the biggest manifestations I’ve been working on compared to the others. I have been admittedly slacking in self-care department, I haven’t been going foreword in my life and my desired career. I have CPTSD and have bouts of depression and constantly have to restart everything, I feel sometimes even my manifestations. It’s become blatant that I’ve been focused wayyyy too much on living in the end and expecting the universe to deliver when I haven’t been putting in the work myself. It’s to the point that my tarot cards have even called me on my bull. 

I’ve manifested SPs and brought them too me, but with my bad habits/low-energy/stagnation the relationships fell apart. These SPs weren’t my “desired” versions of them; they were abusive (verbally), manipulative, or cheaters. My recent SP stopped dating me to date another woman, which I don’t care anymore, I can focus on me. 

TL;DR: your video helped spark a thought of why my previous manifestations backfired. Thank you so much for sharing. Would you suggest I drop the desire completely/forget about my SP to work on myself? Or should I keep the desire, but also continue to work on my life? Either way I’m working on myself."

I was crying before we got to the restaurant and even a bit in the restaurant. I tried to keep my cool and just talked it out with my family.
