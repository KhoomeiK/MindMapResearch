Water is your friend against anxiety. Stay hidrated and keep trying those baths, or at least wash your face regurlaly. You will feel grounded and relaxed. 

Getting help is the best thing. And we are really proud of you.

Feel free to ask some advices. Almost 1yr on treatment here. You can do it."

Until today I have most good days and finally I think I have a chance against this. 
It's an uphill battle but it's worth the effort.

I hope you are getting all the help you need. Cheers."
