TransGuys,fpgi2sv,t1_fpg5wx9,1588603138.0,Thank you ðŸ˜Š
TransGuys,fnvtxik,t1_fnv8cb0,1587304655.0,Thanks! I'd have thought the same thing if it wasn't for the fact that he kept talking about how I should come out. He was very supportive and gendered me correctly so I think it was a wording issue rather than a transphobic one.
TransGuys,fnvtny9,t1_fnuunph,1587304462.0,Same
TransGuys,fnu29hk,t1_fnu1w33,1587253147.0,Thanks. I guess I have just pretty much always felt like a dude. Although I did think I was non-binary for a while ðŸ¤”
TransGuys,fntnr2a,t1_fntnkcm,1587245352.0,Must be a pretty common way to cope
TransGuys,fntngdf,t1_fntmn39,1587245180.0,"I assumed me meant undressed. I don't know if he means that I imagine myself in my ideal body. Which would be the case, because it is easy to cope with things by retreating into fantasy. ðŸ¤”"
socialskills,fnstxi4,t3_g3geum,1587228727.0,I get this a lot. I'm not really sure how to fix it to be honest.
lgbt,fmugy2y,t3_fxbxfl,1586391203.0,Hi Grace!
TransGuys,fmsjt2x,t1_fmr13ex,1586356871.0,I already came out before and it didn't go well
TransGuys,fmpv418,t3_fw8yrw,1586287891.0,I do. I'm not really out to my family after I tried to come out years ago so it's kind of a struggle staying with them
misophoniasupport,flu13o8,t1_fltypgm,1585492786.0,That's interesting. I'm not sure I could really get away with using a speaker outside my room but I'll keep it in mind. I'll try to stuff things around the door if I can  but I have a feeling a lot of the noise travels through the floor. I'll check out that website. I've used similar apps on my phone before and it does seem to help
misophoniasupport,flkk99x,t3_fow3qd,1585242497.0,Thanks for the comments. I think it's already gone past the point where my usual brown noise is useful. I've already bought some decent noise-cancelling headphones at a discount. Gonna look into further noise cancelling as it's pretty much never quiet day or night.
OCD,fl9yp4i,t3_fnf4is,1584972675.0,I do. I have a few slightly changing themes that just keep coming and going over the years. Whenever I get one worked out another one pops up and it almost makes me not want to work on anything  because dealing with something new is always harder then dealing with something that has been going around my head for a while that I'm kind of used to and sort of have an understanding of.
mentalillness,fkqcguh,t1_fkq7zwq,1584440302.0,It sounds like it's a real struggle to be around them. I don't really know what to suggest other than making a space for yourself as much as you can.
mentalillness,fkp5nhy,t3_fjs66c,1584402349.0,That's rough. How do you normally cope when around them?
AmItheAsshole,fkp4ynl,t1_fkoewbv,1584401901.0,"I feel the same way. I've also been diagnosed with OCD, and as hard as it is, she shouldn't be going through other people's stuff."
AskReddit,fklqqst,t3_fj45lt,1584312512.0,"I might just find it interesting but not have anything to add, or not have the energy to respond if it would take a long time to explain"
offmychest,fk8uhu1,t3_fgua2t,1583963154.0,Well done!
intrusivethoughts,fk15xqj,t1_fk15p3b,1583773062.0,I understand. I also analyse things too much. I think accepting things no matter what actually happened is the best way to move forward. I highly doubt you said anything harmful
pics,fk14osn,t3_ffujk9,1583772339.0,Amazing
intrusivethoughts,fk0yqz1,t3_ffv06u,1583769063.0,"It sounds like you're trying to connect what you said with what happened to him, which does seem a little irrational. I understand why you're so stressed about the situation. I'm not sure what to suggest, but it sounds like searching for the messages and through your own memories is making things worse for you"
AskReddit,fk0w27p,t3_ffj71r,1583767417.0,"I've never felt super close to anyone I've dated other than in a friendly way. I've probably had like three proper crushes in my life and I never asked any of those people out. Even if I think I like someone, whenever they try to get intimate with me I freeze up and go almost completely unresponsive. I guess I just have some mental/emotional problems that I don't understand myself and can't be fully honest with other people about"
OCD,fjsjvie,t3_fep8q7,1583597821.0,I feel like that quite a lot
OCD,fjrc191,t1_fjp3tk0,1583583726.0,I agree! I used to use self-deprecating humour all the time but I feel like more positivity is needed
OCD,fjf1lb8,t3_fd1yuz,1583282354.0,I get that sometimes. It doesn't bother me as much as other obsessions though so I'm not sure if it's OCD related for me
