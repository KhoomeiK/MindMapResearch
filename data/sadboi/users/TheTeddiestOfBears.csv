How else would they know if she was unfaithful? If she was pregnant when she wasn't supposed to be. God supposedly gave this curse to her, so he made her womb miscarry, thus conducting an abortion.

Also, in the old testament, god commanded countless people be slaughtered and entire cities of peoples be wiped out - including the men, women (pregnant women as well), children, elderly and even the animals.
