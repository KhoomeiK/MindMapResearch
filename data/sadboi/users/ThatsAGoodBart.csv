What we *do* know is: the fight happened, Molly hasn’t reached out to Issa, and Issa hasn’t reached out to Molly. The fact that the *omniscient narrative point of view* of the show revealed to us what Issa was doing doesn’t somehow endow that character with more responsibility to make contact with her friend. 

OP’s question implies that Issa has more of a responsibility to reach out to Molly, but nothing *within the dramatic text of the show* suggests that at all, you could just as easily apply the question to Molly, because she hasn’t reached out either. We know for a fact by the end of the episode that Molly is out and about, that she’s got her phone. Why should it be Issa’s responsibility and not Molly’s?

She just didn’t. And I’m not making that wild a claim by saying this, because there’s a separate branch of this thread where someone else tried to point this out to you as well. What she communicated to Molly only conveyed that she wasn’t comfortable asking herself, and the *true* extent of the “request” didn’t become clear until she flipped out and her true feelings became known. We’re talking about the merits of *that* request having understood it in its entirety *after the fact*. I’m talking about Molly’s expectations and Molly’s behavior in a post-mortem sense, now that we understand what she meant and what she wanted in a way that may not have been completely clear in earlier points of the show. 

And even if she had been completely upfront when talking about it to Issa, a request is still different from a command, and Molly is being a straight up bad person by flipping out as though someone ignored her command. 

If you *ask* something of somebody, the very fact that you are asking implies that you are prepared to accept the possibility of a yes or a no in equal measure. But you’re going to flip out at a no? You’re not really asking someone not to do something, you’re *telling* someone not to do something. “Don’t do this thing or I’m gonna lose my shit.” Molly has no right telling anyone to do anything.

And of course this is the straw that broke the camels back. I know Issa is a mess, and Issa is not innocent in their friendship. That doesn’t change the fact that, empirically, in this case, Molly was throwing weight around trying to control behavior in a way that was *completely out of line*. It’s shitty behavior, and just because Issa is *also* guilty of shitty behavior doesn’t cancel that fact out or mitigate it in any way."

I, and many other people on this sub, interpret that to mean that Molly does not want to ask for professional favors on behalf of a friend, to her boyfriend. That’s fine. She doesn’t want to blur the line between personally leveraging her relationship to capitalize on Andrew’s career. Totally fair.

I think a big part of my issue might come from also watching a lot of similar shows with my wife - “Millenials living, laughing, and loving in (insert city or neighborhood here)!” - and it’s striking me how, in a lot of ways, they’re all the same show, whether we’re talking about INSECURE, or VIDA, or GIRLS, or GOOD TROUBLE, or anything else. The recurring theme is always self-destructiveness, an inability to communicate meaningfully with the people around them, an inability to accept that relationships are hard and not perfect and take lots of work, an inability to accept compromise, or to be vulnerable, a fear of commitment, self-sabotage at the *thought* of commitment, etc. 

On a very basic level, it speaks to the inherent universality of human experience, but it also hammers home a lot of what’s floating around the collective psyche of a lot of “millennial” creators when it comes to crafting stories about interpersonal relationships. And beyond that, it doesn’t suggest to me that any of these characters on any of these shows will ever have any ability to function in a long-term relationship, with all of the work and compromise and shedding of ego it requires, and all of this couched in a very specific modern context informed by the way technology and social media has shaped the modern landscape of how we date and relate to each other. It makes me want to shake them all by the shoulders and tell them to grow up, and I’m basically the same age as them! 

Anyway, as I said earlier, you’re correct that every relationship and context is different. But *dang*, when you’re watching all these characters on screen and you can see from a mile away they’re about to blow it for themselves, or blatantly making selfish decisions that will only make them miserable later, it starts to wear on you.

I don’t actually. I have never (and would never) set terms and conditions for how any of my friends (even the ones who are irresponsible fuckups, or even the ones I might have problems with at any given time) could or could not reach out and communicate with my wife (or girlfiend, when she was my girlfriend), because that’s for *her* to decide and for *her* to manage, not me. Anyone can talk to her or ask her about any damn thing they want, even the people I would prefer not bother her, because it’s not my place to exert control like that. No one needs to give me a heads up or ask for my blessing, because I trust in her ability to make decisions and handle herself like a responsible adult person. It would be disrespectful to my wife for me to approach it any other way. Seems like a pretty healthy and common sense thing to practice in an adult relationship, at least in the sense that it’s been working well for us for the past 17 years. 

If you don’t want to invite your co-workers to your girlfriend’s rave event, that’s totally fine. It’s another thing entirely to demand they not go if they somehow got invited without your participation or involvement. 

If you’re uncomfortable with your friends being FB friends with your mom, that’s totally understandable. But it’s another thing entirely to order one of your friends to reject a friend request from your mom if she, for instance, had found them and tried to add them. 

You can compartmentalize all you want within the bubble of your own personhood, within the scope of the way *you* interact with the people in your life. We all have an ideal version in our head of the different “sectors” of our lives and how they meet. But we ultimately don’t have all that much control of it beyond *ourselves*, nor should we, in the grand scheme of things. It’s ridiculous to try to expand that “bubble” by force and try to police how people can and can’t interact amongst each other on their own, *separate from you*. 

All that being said, any relationship is in itself a social contract (made more literal in marriage by there being an *actual* contract). But it’s not so much a contract of control as it is an agreement between two people of what they’d like to value and uphold between themselves, and it’s different for any two (or more) people. So when I’m talking about not controlling my wife, or my friends, and how they interact and what they can and cannot say to each other, I’m saying this because I trust my wife as an autonomous person to make decisions on her own in the spirit of that agreement and in the interest of those mutual values and concerns.

As much as Molly might be justified in her opinion of Issa, her “declaration of separation”, as it were, doesn’t speak very highly of her opinion of Andrew either, or of her trust in his ability to make the “right” decision in the face of Issa’s request, as an autonomous adult person of his own."
