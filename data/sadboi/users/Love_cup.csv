Expecting free shit is being entitled. You are owed nothing."

I just do no agree with those who expect it. Especially when someone is just starting out or just turning a profit. Discounts shouldn't be expected, they should be appreciated when given."
AmItheAsshole,f0vxfs9,t3_d6wob4,1568994115.0,"NTA I understand the renovation of the home (although to that extent feels like a lot) but to rename a living animal? Let alone one that helped your dad out of dark times. That's outright petty. 

I'd talk to your dad and explain how you feel. Let him know this is too far and you refuse to call his dog out of its name."

It almost amplifies the symptoms? I dont know. It's just overall shitty."
unpopularopinion,f0vp3gj,t3_d6v3ku,1568988218.0,This is absolutely true. Friends are supposed to help build you up. How does one build a business on discounts? It's just rude to expect something at a cheaper price.
Anxiety,f0vokqo,t3_d6v3l1,1568987829.0,"It happened to me the other night at a friends. 

He was talking to me about his favorite show in the hallway and I started to feel nauseous. About 60 seconds after my eyes became sensitive to the light and it felt like a million needles exploded in my head. I couldn't stand straight and felt like I was in a fishbowl. 

Freaking out I was able to ask him to walk me to my car and he sat with me. He was able to talk me down, but it was intense and draining."
AmItheAsshole,f0vo482,t3_d6v3pe,1568987477.0,"NAH- like you said he is a beginner so it isnt really his fault, however it is impacting your routine. You can either be honest and let him know that you've shown him the ropes and you two can go to the gym together, BUT you are going to work out separately, or you can say that since you have a new job you have a new schedule and cant work out with him anymore."

Growing up my mom supported our family and my dad stayed home. He cooked all meals, tended the house, and made sure we got to school. 

I think it's more than fair to have her tend the household duties."

AmItheAsshole,eyld8nt,t3_cxg646,1567181792.0,"NTA. 

The kid is 11. He was being a brat and your sister knows it. Shes only encouraging him to continue to act this way. I personally would not watch him again under ANY circumstances and skip his and her gifts until it adds up to a new PS4. You were being kind and they both stomped all over you."
AmItheAsshole,eyld21g,t1_eyl9pke,1567181671.0,This is a brilliant idea and absolutely valid. Just get him a card for those events and call it a day. Same with your sister. Whatever money you would have spent can go towards the ps4.
relationship_advice,exvunn6,t1_exvuhas,1566606996.0,I havent read through it all either. All I know is he should either involve the parents or the police. A 26 year old declaring their love for a 13 year old is not appropriate. The whole situation is sketch.
relationship_advice,exvudo0,t1_exvtcmm,1566606832.0,It doesn't matter if he is jealous or not. The information provided is information she gave OP.
relationship_advice,exvsrgp,t1_exvrn2o,1566605871.0,That a 26 year old has been grooming a female teenager for the past two years. Come on guys.

relationship_advice,exfqxiw,t3_csmfst,1566246461.0,You already know what you have to do. Tell your father the truth. Your mother should know better than to make threats of cutting communication. Shes enabling your sister and until you are honest with your father... you are too.
AmItheAsshole,ewz2rmf,t1_ewyxuky,1565890364.0,That definitely poses an issue. Do you have an uncle or someone you can take instead?
