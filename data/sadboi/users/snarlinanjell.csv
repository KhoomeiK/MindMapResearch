If other people have gotten three days you can ask HR what has changed. If other employees have gotten one day, then you’re out of luck. If it’s been a mix, your manager can probably apply some pressure for you to get three days and for HR to fix the policy so it’s clear going forward. 

An employer cannot dock an exempt employee’s pay in NH unless the employee requests it without coercion and the absence isn’t due to the employee’s illness.

Hopefully the agency is able to figure something out and takes you back on as a client. I agree with other people though, you should start looking elsewhere for care. Yes, it’s expensive and it isn’t what you planned on. But there isn’t much you can do if the agency says they won’t service you any longer. 

There’s likely language in your husband’s benefit plan that says the agency can refuse service at their discretion.

I've struggled with depression for 20+ years and my mom has never accepted it, even after a hospitalization when I was 18. It took until I was into my 30's before I was able to put my needs ahead of appeasing my mom. I often heard from family that I was spoiled and ungrateful and it left me with very little self-esteem. You deserve to have your needs listened to and met."
relationship_advice,ew8pk2g,t1_ew8dkjd,1565213223.0,Thanks! That would be awesome. I’m always left wondering what the hell happened after we argue. There’s been plenty of times where I’m left wondering if I’m the asshole and he’s the victim. It feels like riding a rollercoaster.
relationship_advice,ew8p6du,t1_ew8ey55,1565213062.0,"Thank you for this. It is difficult, but it’s a demon I’ve struggled with before. People tend to think I have a chip on my shoulder, in reality I’m just terrified of letting people get to close to me."
relationship_advice,ew8opnp,t1_ew8nk4b,1565212860.0,"Intellectually I know to give the benefit of doubt. In practice with my husband it’s admittedly very difficult to do. We’ve been on a year long potty training battle. Our kid FINALLY got enough stickers for a prize at 7pm on a weeknight. She wanted to go for ice cream. We are literally just about to get on our bikes to leave and the phone rings. He answers it because it’s a customer. Yes, he works hard. Yes, he has good intentions. But there are no boundaries. No time that is just for us as a family. And no time for him. I go visit my mom with the kids every 6 weeks or so and give him time alone. And he works. Now if he could do all of this and not bring the stress home and take it out on me, I’d feel differently. He works because he wants to provide for us and because he likes the respect he gets at work. We’ve discussed this. The thing is, financially he could make more money not being a manager and he wouldn’t work so much. If he didn’t work so much, I could get the certs I need. With the extra income we could have a boat AND the time to go out on it."
relationship_advice,ew8ei55,t1_ew8buka,1565208363.0,I feel like our idea of what a 'good life' consists of is different. I'd like to camp and have game nights and watch movies with our kids. He wants to buy a 20k+ boat.
AskWomenOver30,ew8cp9v,t3_cmyi7z,1565207604.0,"None. I have male friends that I see 1 on 1. My husband doesn't have any close female friends, but I don't think I would care if he saw a female co-worker alone or something like that."
AskWomenOver30,ew8c2ld,t3_cmxl2d,1565207343.0,Riding my bike down a big hill and the swings at the amusement park. Those two things always bring up a sense of sweet and pure joy in me that I only felt as a child. Just thinking about it makes me smile.
relationship_advice,ew8aqxo,t1_ew885ks,1565206764.0,I'm not sure what normal is at all. Leaving is tough- we live in a state where we would likely end up splitting 50/50 and I wouldn't get child support since we earn about the same. There's no way I could afford a house on my own here. The COL has gotten out of control the last few years.
relationship_advice,ew8aizl,t1_ew89pie,1565206634.0,"I've definitely focus on doing things that I want to do and like to do without him. It's tough because I'm depressed so it's hard to force myself out of the house. I do have some moms that I met when the 3 year old was a baby. I'm sort of on the outskirts of the group, but I could reach out to them and see if anyone is receptive."
relationship_advice,ew8a5kf,t1_ew89om0,1565206412.0,"That's good advice. We can't talk about anything because my words get twisted and things end up my fault somehow. I threw him a surprise party for his 39th birthday (it was last minute and I screwed up the messaging and people though it was his 40th, but all of his family and friends were there and he was surprised...), but because we just had a cookout with my dad for his 40th somehow I shafted him.... I got up and left him sitting at the restaurant by himself after he said that."

AmItheAsshole,ew81c7z,t1_ew7z7to,1565201348.0,What the hell? She offered to go get it and she had a golf cart. Don’t assume someone isn’t able to do something just because of their age.
WhitePeopleTwitter,ew7vusk,t1_ew7epif,1565198222.0,I work in a two person HR department for a mid-sized tech company. Don’t call me unless you need an accommodation to apply or you’re calling me back.
WhitePeopleTwitter,ew7shh5,t3_cn51lu,1565196545.0,"HR here. I literally just got off the phone with some one asking me questions about a position we have posted. They are also having problems resetting their password in order to apply. WE ARE A TECH COMPANY AND THIS PERSON WANTS TO APPLY FOR A TECH POSITION. WHY ARE YOU ASKING HR FOR TECH ASSISTANCE?!?! 

Seriously, don’t call HR and bother us with questions about the job. If you need an accommodation in order to apply, I’m happy to help. Otherwise, just apply like everyone else."

AmItheAsshole,ev88yqh,t1_ev87trp,1564272598.0,"Dating is a process to get to know someone. You can’t possibly tell someone everything before your first date. If you don’t want to date someone with kids, ask them if they have kids. There are many, many things that are important to know about someone. Are you a felon? Do you have any major health conditions? Have you ever had an STD? What’s your HIV status?"
AmItheAsshole,ev87hov,t1_ev86tj1,1564271409.0,"Found it. Yup. Pretty shitty to lie about not having kids. I dated as a single mom and never would have lied about my kid. I’m proud as fuck about her and it would never cross my mind to say she didn’t exist. That’s a crap thing to do as a parent. I still maintain that if two people are looking for something short-term, a parent doesn’t have to disclose having a kid."
