P.S: ""Marijuana"" is a term with negative connotations since it was used to associate Cannabis to Mexicans, which at the time were probably as prosecuted as Black People. To make a long story short, they basically used the Term ""Marijuana"" to link ""Colored People"" with ""Dangerous Drugs"" as a last ditch effort to get Cannabis Prohibited and Illegal, and at the same time, get ""good reasons"" to search every ""Dirty Negroes or Spics"" person's or Car and Possessions!

P.S #2: Just wanted to clarify I don't speak like this but that's how they were at the time...I'm from Canada so we never had laws against anyone of any color and ""Aliens"" for us has always been the ""Little Green Men from Space"" lol
Hell, I'm not even sure if ""Spic"" is the right Slur for Mexicans. Were I am though, it's pretty rare to have someone directly from Mexico. Second generations are much more frequent. I say that but we have a VERY diversified  Town, City and Country too. And it makes things so much more awesome! Great food, entertainment and performances! And also, so many New Things to Learn/See and great Cultures to take in...

Highly recommended for the Price/Performance Ratio!
All you need is either a vape Mod or buy 1 with it...and a Bong/Rig and you are all set!


(I Probably would of bought the G43 when my Vriptech Heat Wand 3.0 broke instead of spending around 800$CAD on the Titanium Cadilllac of Vaporizers...a NewVape Showerhead + Wrap-Around.)


But I have to say that being so clumsy or just unlucky sometimes have made me lose a few bongs over the years...but the performance and the solidity of the NewVapes Showerhead and  Wrap-Around kit is Beautifully Made and it's Full Titanium Construction is probably the only reason why I haven't broken it yet! And with their new Models I really do have to make a Shout-out to [NewVape.com](http://www.newvape.com) for their great Craftsmanship and that also goes for their glass bongs and other glass offerings.
If you have a tendency to have accidents, they are somehow very resistant and resilient but they will eventually break so you might as well take a second one in case the unthinkable would happen...


I sure wish I would of bought a second one because the 1 I got wasn't nearly as good at filtering and it doesn't fit the case as well either...


But their bongs aren't very ""special"" but for the price you shouldn't expect them to be buf they are great Solid Pieces, for Beginners and Experts alike! 


All I mean to say is that for good performances at a good price, no matter how much the total is, it might not be the most feature rich, or the most polished Vape but I'm pretty sure that for the price it'll be pretty hard to beat.

Profits means they are doing something right. Hoping that because you ""encourage them"" they will want to do good on you is just ""Wishful Thinking"".

With MOM's you might be able to return Bad Cannabis, or get a Refund...you have some recourse!

So if you wanted to verify your goods before leaving so as not to get screwed, it appears they've thought about everything!
So basically as soon as you paid for it, it's out of the SQDC's Hands even though they have your Money!

And let's not forget that they are another Monopoly with absolutely no Possibility of having Any Competition since the SQDC is the only place that can Legally Sell Cannabis in Canada.
So they have a Legal Cannabis Monopoly in the Industry (which is disgusting!).

And to smoke or Vaporize it legally it has to be in your House (NOT a Condominium!) and Renters have to go Outside in Specifically Allowed Cannabis Smoking Places...but I wouldn't know.
That's one more rule I won't subject myself to!
I will keep Vaping my Cannabis Flowers for Medicinal Reasons in my Home until someone tells me that it bothers them, which is something I have never heard even when Cannabis was Illegal.

It doesn't help that my Absentee Father's only communications with me are about how I'm not working and I'm lazy etc...or manipulations, like ""If you can hold down a job for at least 3 months, I'll think about meeting with you..."" and other such BS.

I mean, no matter how much I miss having a Father and how I'd like to have one again, I know it's only to try and ""Force"" me, even though I can't even last more than a Month...so no matter how much I'd love to, I couldn't even if I tried!

And I know deep down, that even IF (and it's a really big IF!) he decided to see me, he'd force himself to see me...which I don't want, and it'd probably only be to tell me something like ""See, I knew you could do it!"" which means: ""See, I knew you were Faking and/or Lying!"""

If you are talking about Cannabis, and you are worried it must mean that you are using Cartridge-Based ""Vaping"". It also seems like that's your only Measure and source of info when it comes to Vaping.

If you are that worried, why not buy a device that let's you use Your Own Concentrates/Extracts?

And there's also the ""Real"" Vaping, or rather, how I think ""Vaping Cannabis"" should be seen rather than the Cartridge-Based Vaping devices...
I'm talking about Herb Vaporizers!
Yes! You can also just buy or receive (as a gift for example) your Cannabis Flowers and with a good Herb Vaporizer like the Arizer ArGo/Solo2 for a Session-type of Vaporizer or the Ghost MV1 for a Hard Hitter that you can use in a few big puffs or space your puffs out all day if you want to too...
A Session Vape is generally better for small group use than ""Vape-As-You-Wish"" Vaporizers like the Ghost MV1 but it's a Great Heavy Hitter  and well built with sleek and almost must-haves Accessories and ""Upgrades""...

I can understand people who keep just smoking joints but if you are or were a Cartridge (Cart) Vape User and are now scared for your Health, why not try the slew of Alternatives that let's you use whatever product you Trust!

It's worth noting that if you are in an Illegal State or Country, the chances of having Fake Cartridges far Outweigh your Savings and the it isn't worth your Health!
But it's a free Country and you'll do as you please but try the other options! You won't regret it!
Good Concentrates and a good little setup or device and it's great! And as Safe as Possible!

The only thing you can do is to either tough it out for a while without getting any or much sleep until you get ""un-used"" to it, or what might be a better option for you is to reduce your dose over time (ie: Wean off slowly rather than all at once).
Depending on your personality type and how you felt during those 2 days, decide which is best for yourself...

It's also important to mention that if you have some important health issues  like cardiac problems and similar, consulting a doctor might be your best bet, not to mention that they sometimes have some alternative medications or even completely different medications that would help you wean off without too much uncomfortable feelings if you're lucky and your physician is familiar with protocols to wean off the Medication you want to stop taking..."

raisedbynarcissists,f1qb8qg,t1_f1oqfsx,1569697233.0,"I rented a room once from an Old Woman who was a former retired Teacher.
We started having problems because she didn't have any friends and was ""jealous of all the time I spent out with friends, and my expensive lifestyle"" lol
I was working Minimum Wage at a Factory and my ""expensive outings"" was me and a friend going to get a Beer or 2 at the Corner-Store and drinking it at a Park Close By...at most a 5$ outing...
Later that Year, she basically told me that ""she wasn't comfortable having me around and would like me to leave ASAP!"" To which I answered, well I already paid for the month and our Written Agreement is far from being over! (I had already paid for the next 2 weeks, and was only supposed to move in 2 other months so I already had started looking at what was available, but nothing serious, just browsing and getting a feel for the prices/space/location.)
She made me sign a paper that stated she wanted me out right away and said that I had to sign if I understood...and I signed, adding that ""I have read and understood what was said but did not agree in any way!""

 But I had nowhere to go!

She eventually brought a BIG Neighbour, probably fed him some bs about me being a ""rowdy young problematic renter"" or whatever...asking me to come out to talk about ""the issue"", to which I said ""No"" multiple times, even saying I didn't feel safe coming out...and that there was no such thing as an ""issue"" going on other than the owner going back on their word and on our agreement, of which I have proof!
So they called the Cops, and magically I was getting evicted (which the Cops don't have a right to), I showed them how I was paying every Month! And that I still had 2 full weeks or half a month that I have already paid for! They did not care one bit!

They then showed me a piece of paper that She wrote saying that this house didn't fall within the parameters of a rental home/property because there was only 2 rooms. (Problem is that she only had 2 rooms when she bought the house but modified her living room into her little Bachelorette with her bedroom + TV Room all rolled into one, which to me should 100% count as a bedroom!
But that didn't matter! Even if I had real proofs from reliable parties, and all she provided was things she, herself wrote! I got 7 days to leave! All ILLEGALLY! FROM COPS!

All that because as she said in our first meeting, she was actually looking for students, so she could have interesting conversations with and help tutor them...

So she kicked me out because she was looking for Students to Befriend! Because she has no friends!

Such selfishness!
And I really wasn't a problem at all! When I wasn't working I would be in my room, quiet.

She also did the same for the most part...and for the ~4 months I was there, I may have crossed path with her maybe a handful of times Thanks to my Severe Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder which gives me weird hours (schedule) and the fact that we both remained in our respective rooms most of the time...

The only thing I did was make Pizza very late (but kind of early for me...) and for an unknown reason, her Fire Alarm was EXTREMELY Sensitive and To Off just because I'd want my cheese slightly grilled and not white as the snow and basically have a golden brown look but that started the alarm...it wasn't even a little bit Brown and far from being burnt or dark brown...and nothing was burned but it still Went Off and Made a TON of Noise!

But anyways, from the ridiculousness of your message it's quite clear to me that even the most logical of explanations and in-detail explanation of the gun laws and how some of them are completely absurd and useless, that you still wouldn't change your mind because you're already set on your decision...

CanadaPolitics,ezztjan,t1_ezmhjzx,1568292738.0,"Mostly, my point is that Bans and Banning Things should be reserve as a very last resort!

These days People seem to skip every other steps and go straight for Bans!

And as it's been said ""Whatever has been banned is probably NOT the most pressing issue to solve"" since it was probably banned because the segment of the population needing or wanting it wasn't big enough to put up any real opposition to those Bans!

It's just ridiculously Easy to get something Banned, but getting things Unbanned is practically impossible to do!

And yes that's exactly what I meant by ridiculous laws, but I also meant that yes the system here works pretty well regarding acquring a license and the background check (though admittedly, getting checked Everyday, which is more than a Sexual Predator gets checked or a Murderer does, is a bit insulting!)
But it Also goes for NEW laws they wanna put here...talk of Banning Rifles or Handguns or Both, adding more restrictions on the few guns we have available (so more Restricted guns and more Prohibited Guns...as if we don't have enough).
But I still think if we'd popularize the Sport Shooting competition and Training, we'd have more fun, more acceptable prices for ammo and gun ranges memberships, and maybe cheaper training and licenses, Gun Ranges in the City so that it's more Accessible for city dwellers to go shooting AND to also Try Shooting if you've never been shooting before (you really should try it before you bash it! Most people FOR more Gun Regulations are usually people that know NOTHING about guns and most have never fired a gun...).

One last thing I find ridiculous too is the Self-Defense Laws in Canada...that seriously needs a revision. (Yeah you should run away whenever possible but I also believe we should have some type of ""Castle Doctrine"" like in the U.S. and shouldn't have to run away from your own house! Also, if you are home, or have something that could be used to defend yourself, you should be within your right to use ANYTHING you Can to defend yourself with! After all, the attacker can stop attacking and run away if you are ""more armed"" and it's ""not fair"" LOL

And if you are home, and have a Gun, you should be allowed to use it to defend yourself and your property...

Oh and BTW, it's not just gun laws that are messed up. Knife laws too are weird! I can possess and walk around with a Sword Cane (longer than 30cm), a Sword on my back and a Humongous Rambo Knife (Bowie) strapped to myself and although it is weird and suspicious, it's fully legal! But owning a 3""-5"" Auto/Butterfly/Out-The-Front Knife is illegal though? Doesn't make sense when the swords and fixed blade knives (non-folding knife) are straight up ready to use, banning something for it's appearance/features without any effect on lethality or stupid things like not allowing/banning any knife that comes out Automatically by pressing a button, but allowing knives that comes out Automatically by applying pressure to the blade or protrusion on the blade, is just ridiculous when an article is banned because of where you press to get it to open Automatically!
And Banning things to protect People from Themselves isn't a good reason either that isn't for the Government to control! Just like it shouldn't be ok to let them control what we can and can't put in our Bodies!

But I'm starting to get off topic here...

P.S: You don't need a Ferrari/Lamborghini/other Extremely expensive and Powerful Cars, but I'm sure you'd like a Luxury vehicle...even though you'll never ""Need"" one, but that shouldn't be a reason to make it illegal to own one!

For those interested, here is what I first wanted to respond with though; ""Between []""

[I'm not trying to attract ""Votes"", simply to raise awareness to the big issue that is ""Over-Legislating"" and Senselessly tacking on more and more Laws won't solve a Problem that comes from Criminals.

Also, I am NOT against anything we are presently doing right now as for gun ""control"". 
The only thing I'd like to see is less Ignorant Hate towards Guns and Law Abiding Citizens who own guns, more programs to help Target Shooting and Marksmanship related activities ""Take-Off"" as a sport and a Decrease in the amount of Fees and other costs related to owning guns, outside of the actual equipment required (since you guys aren't apparently big on Logic and/or just do not want to Discuss.)

I'd like to point out what someone said...they said they were also a collector of knives but that for them there were an incredible amount of more pressing issues than knife ""reform"". And I agree, but that is why I don't believe in making things illegal BECAUSE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT to most people...

But people Panic and they want to BAN BAN BAN! Just like they want to maybe BAN guns or pistols or rifles because of mass shootings...

The reality is that even if you got rid of every gun you could find, there's still gonna be mass killings...maybe not with a gun, but with a sword, a huge Rambo knife, a kitchen knife (fixed knives/blades aren't illegal in anyway but I can't own a knife because it opens automatically with a Button, but those that open automatically by using a detent on the blade is legal? (Commonly known as ""Assisted Opening"") oh and plenty of Jobs and occupations require a knife to be able to be opened with 1 hand FOR SAFETY! (Being in a boat for example).

But anyways, you don't seem open to having a conversation about it nor have you found any real reasons to refute my idea to have a firearm and knife reform...

Anyways, debating doesn't have any place for your ""Feelings""...only cold, logical facts have their place...
Your irrational fears of guns and/or knives (which are in everyone's kitchen, and those are the most used to commit murders BTW, not Autos, Balisongs or Out-The-Front Knives...should we ban Kitchen knives too? And Box Cutters?)

Laws don't affect Criminals...so don't expect these Laws to have ANY effects on Crime Rates related to armed crimes...

Even if you were to BAN anything that bludgeons or stab/cuts or shoots...people are creative, whether that's how they hide their ""new contraband"" or how they make new ones out of ANYTHING, because anything can become a weapon!

From an Ex User, 1 thing not to do would be to Push her towards Detox and Rehab...it won't work unless she wants to quit herself and for herself too, not for someone else.

After 1 Week (7 Days) Clean, she should already be through the Withdrawal Phase and start feeling better. Shouldn't be too bad either since she wasn't taking very high doses at all, but everyone reacts differently...

I was so proud because years ago I had stopped Cutting...but recently I've started up again and pretty ferociously I should say...
(I don't like it but it beats feeling Extremely Suicidal or getting back on IV Opiates/Heroin just to remain alive/not kill myself...

Just being honest...though I'm not planning to commit suicide I feel so bad some times that it stays on my mind and I also think about it when crap happens to me...which probably happens day to day at the moment...

As you may already know, I don't actually Want to Die...all I want is to have my pain go Away!"
