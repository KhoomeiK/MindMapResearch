SuicideWatch,fqn5ymo,t1_fql6nxp,1589489236.0,"It just sucks that I give so much and don’t receive anything. It’s honestly nice to know that people do care about you. That’s what makes you think I’m taking things for granted. I legitimately don’t have anyone who helps me or cares for me.

What I’m saying is I don’t expect or demand care from anybody. It just upsets me that I don’t ever receive it when I do so much for other people. If they don’t want to give it then I’m not going to be like “fuck you then” yknow? It’s my choice to care. I was also really upset when making the post to begin with. It’s selfish of them to say they care and not act on it. I’d much rather be told they just don’t care so I don’t get false hope."

SuicideWatch,fqk52op,t1_fqjqk6h,1589420310.0,That makes sense
SuicideWatch,fqk4vdc,t1_fqjomh1,1589420208.0,"Glad there are people out there who care about you. That makes one of us.

The point of the post was to say that nobody cares about how hurt you are as an individual unless you threaten to kill yourself. Meaning you vocalize it and they don’t care.

Plus this was a rant. I didn’t expect anyone to even reply. I was just getting my feelings out there.

Edit: calling people names like that doesn’t get your point across. Is it that difficult to talk like a human being?"

SuicideWatch,fqhy0jj,t1_fqhxqun,1589386559.0,It’s because nobody ever thinks they’ll actually do it. And when they do they say “oh we could’ve prevented this somehow” and they pretend to care after you go too

SuicideWatch,fqhwnn4,t1_fqhw5gt,1589385892.0,"I honestly don’t know why the counselor told my parents. It’s just the education system I guess where apparently confidentiality laws aren’t taken into consideration. And yes, I mean verbal abuse.

To this day she’s incredibly emotionally abusive though"
SuicideWatch,fqhvtcn,t1_fqhviss,1589385475.0,Not that I know of. I’ve tried talking to the counselor but she just told everything to my mom and I got in trouble.

SuicideWatch,fqhpww4,t1_fqhpo1t,1589382021.0,That’s EXACTLY how my mom is. Or like if I go and talk to her I’m ungrateful for everything she’s done for me when she’s done the bare minimum of what a parent SHOULD DO like shelter and food. And it’s not even that I’m not grateful for it it’s just that I’m fucking depressed and asked for help and you give me shit in return and call me ungrateful because “at least it’s something” when it’s really not.

SuicideWatch,fqhmxm4,t1_fqh5c3d,1589380266.0,That’s how it’s like for me rn. But then if I go ahead and do it “oh what could we have done to prevent this” as if they didn’t already fucking know. Sorry you’re going through it too

SuicideWatch,fqgmxky,t1_fqglbxl,1589350720.0,"Right?? Like it never just goes away there are just better periods. And asking for help is what you should do, if he doesn’t want to deal with that then he shouldn’t say to reach out or that he’s there"
SuicideWatch,fqgmtie,t1_fqglias,1589350625.0,This post comes out of exhaustion from caring way too much about how other people felt. It’s from being so tired of constantly caring about other people and not getting anything in return. This is me being fed up with it all. I’m well aware other people have problems. It’s why I don’t reach out because I don’t need to be a burden but it’s definitely nice to feel cared about.
SuicideWatch,fqgks15,t1_fqgjx4l,1589348943.0,Exactly. And then they’re impatient too as it it’s something you can just get over. “Think positively” okay thanks I’m cured! 🙄
SuicideWatch,fqgkpv9,t1_fqgjwui,1589348896.0,Trust me I understand. I’ve made the mistake of trying to open up to people who don’t care because they said they do. Now all I do is open up to strangers on the internet lol

depression_help,fogyqv8,t3_g74k07,1587758517.0,"I’d suggest talking to him about how you feel. What cheating is is defined by the couple themselves, not society. So if you view it as cheating, then talk to him.

If you’ve talked to him however and he refuses to change, then as much as it may hurt, I’d suggest trying to find someone else with the same views as you.

This post hit close to home with me. I view porn the same way you do, and my boyfriend watched it and I drove myself crazy over it. I became incredibly insecure and upset and it ate me alive. I ended up talking to him about it, and once he knew how I felt about it, did everything he could to change it and hasn’t watched it in who knows how long. He’s since reassured me a lot and I am grateful for him.

However it may not be the case with you, and if my boyfriend didn’t give it up, I wouldn’t be with him right now. It’s a boundary that you have. If he doesn’t respect that, then he won’t respect other boundaries you have. If he calls you ridiculous or crazy, you aren’t. That’s a form of manipulation to trick the partner into thinking they’re being irrational when they aren’t. It’s called gaslighting.

And if he decides to give it up for you, I have some suggestions. My boyfriend obviously has his needs and I can’t be there 100% of the time for him, so I allow him to save photos/ videos of me for times like that. It might help you too, who knows.

My best of luck to you ❤️"
