SuicideWatch,ffwj67x,t1_ffwa8yp,1580302745.0,"34/female. I had my c6/c7 disc in my neck replaced about 2 years ago due to uncontrollable migraines. I was pushed out of my career that took me 23 years to find and be passionate about. That was devastating!! I was  hospitalized on a phsyc hold. Its been about a year since I've been seeing a therepist once a week and a physlogyist once a month. I'm on a boatload of medication. 
Buspirone10mg 2tbs/3x day
Bupropion(XL) 450mg 1/day
venlaflaxine 24hr 150mg+75mg=225mg/day
Ambien 1st bedtime
Tizanidine 4mg 1tab 3x/day
Topamax 25mg for the next 2weeks and then up'd
Lyrica 150mg 2/day
I've realized that I don't have a great support system at home. And well my ""friend"" I'm rethinking if that's even what they are."
SuicideWatch,f3rdf6x,t1_f3plt5w,1571086932.0,thank you for taking time out of your day to hear me out!! you are a kind soul.
SuicideWatch,f3pnjds,t3_dhqq0h,1571062052.0,I do miss her...every day. She imprinted on my heart.  I've told her about my feelings but i guess we are two totally different people now and it most likely would only end in more hurt.
SuicideWatch,f3pm3nu,t1_f3plt5w,1571061406.0,I just don't understand why she is still in my subconscious. It's been forever since we were together. I've had a few rally close relationships since but the connection we shared can never be replaced by anyone.
SuicideWatch,eyy7m0w,t3_cz5xj7,1567574309.0,Do real people even read these? maybe my title should have been more catchy?
depression,ewpn2k0,t3_cp1ajy,1565644768.0,"All.The.Time. I feel like this around my family even. I recently dropped all my ""friends"" except two people whom actually understand me. some days I'm completely fine with it just being my dog and I. Other days I yern to have a connection."
