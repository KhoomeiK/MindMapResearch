depression,ewe91j2,t1_ewe6po9,1565317485.0,"By the way, you’re doing great recognising and talking about the feelings, and never feel guilty talking to people on the internet about things like this - we are all like minded, in similar situations and if people don’t want to help or be involved, they don’t have to read or respond. Plus although they don’t mind, it’s nice to tell others who aren’t just the same loved ones all the time."
depression,ewe8h71,t1_ewe6po9,1565317067.0,"I know I don’t know you, but to me volunteering felt perfect for you from what you were saying. Your right though, everyone here has or had issues at one point - and I think most still have.  Being comfortable is one reason, scared is similar but I think mostly change is unnerving factor - it’s like a fear of the unknown more than a success or worry about failure
I’ve worked and helped with the homeless in my free time and honestly it’s very rewarding and eye opening - with only a couple of small changes to circumstances we could all end up there too."
depression,ewe5nrm,t3_cntom7,1565315071.0,"It’s gonna sound weird and unhelpful, but since it sounds like you need to be kept busy or in a routine to stop the thinking (which I totally understand too) then maybe while the hours at work have been cut take up something to fill the time and pass the days - I know you said you struggle to motivate yourself to work out or follow through with gym or hobbies, so maybe something like volunteer work where there’s a structure and expectation of a routine might help? It could be something as fun and rewarding as playing with puppies at the local pound"
depression,ewawjnc,t1_ew9t4py,1565253606.0,"You’re welcome, most problems aren’t as big when you take one step backwards and see it from another perspective. I hope you have a great vacation and enjoy yourself"
depression,ew9h5rg,t3_cn8mo8,1565225239.0,"Truthfully, barely any strangers are even looking at you at the beach - if you think of the last time you were there, how many people can you remember looking at long enough to even notice the colour of their swimwear never mind being able to pick them out of a lineup.  Chances are it’s not many & the same goes the other way too. They aren’t looking more than a casual glance in your direction - no one is judging you like you feel they might be.

You say you could be mistaken for a young teen - who are they to know your true age and logically, why would they care? People come in all shapes and sizes and if you pass for a young teen now, imagine the jealousy from everyone when you get ID checked in your 30s - your friends of the same age will be super jealous because they older you get, the better it is to look young"
depression,ew9colm,t1_ew99ijn,1565223193.0,"I read your other post  - sounds like you’re super intelligent (valedictorian & Ivy League future) and overthink things like the rest of us super intelligent people. Being more intelligent than most people is isolating and leads to overthinking and focusing on the mistakes more than we should. I guarantee you in college you will meet a lot more like minded and similarly inclined people you will instantly gel with more than the current pool of friends and as a result you’ll feel better and life will get better. Sounds stupid to say, but intelligence and over analysis and focusing on the wrong things are highly linked - it’s also why we end up drinking more than the less gifted, we try to numb the brain cells to stop the thinking"

I completely get not being able to enjoy the good things by being in a bad headspace. Loneliness is very isolating and battling our personal demons makes us push people away and makes things worse. What’s the most stressful thing that’s making you sick?"
depression,ew99tja,t3_cndfzd,1565221896.0,"Honestly, you can kill yourself if that’s what you want, but people posting here are trying to help and don’t know all the details. Shouting at and attacking people trying to help is generally a bad idea, but again, your call. You wouldn’t have posted if you didn’t want people to help or listen in some way - we are, so what can we do to help?"
depression,ew977bv,t3_cnd69p,1565220723.0,"You’re doing great and making a very positive step. It’s often hard to see a relationship was abusive until it ends, but know that as the victim of the abuse, it wasn’t your fault and without the bad influence, you will grow to be happier with time. The emotional scars eventually heal and with the right person you can learn to trust again. It takes a lot of time, but you’re best off away from that asshole."

I mean I’ve felt the same about me at times so I understand the sentiment, but is there anything pushing you over the edge now? When I look back at the things I worried about at your age I realise I made them out to be so much more significant than they turned out to be later in life"
depression,ew92oii,t1_ew8yeq3,1565218713.0,"Not completely true but totally see why you’d feel that way. People want positivity out of whatever the relationship is. When we feel negatively, we instinctively push people away & they grasp at someone more positive or fulfilling. Sometimes it’s a case of fake it til you make it, but I’m not even sure I know what happy is these days so probably not the best to give advice"

I have people who care, I’m not watching the pennies & I have a good job, but honestly, there’s a lot of the time I fail to see the point in living.

Right now, if I don’t wake up tomorrow, I’m ok with it"
