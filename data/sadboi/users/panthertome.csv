AskGirls,fqwkv6c,t1_fqv6ips,1589708178.0,"I'm really sorry that happened to you. That person is not the person you're meant to be with though. In a good relationship, you will be able to tell that special person everything. They don't say a problem shared is a problem 10/90, they say halved because you take an equal share and support each other through it. I'm sure you'd like to find someone that you could tell all the gory details to, and they would laugh with you because they 100% supported you. Also I'm sure you'd like to find that in return, a woman who would tell you everything and not hold back or have walls up. Think it'll be harder for you because you've been through things that a lot of people simply won't be able to comprehend, but I think finding the person who gets that will make it all the sweeter in the end."
dating_advice,fqwj0kc,t1_fqwelu3,1589706199.0,"""Putting yourself out there"" is basically a venn diagram. 

You're in your own little circle, doing things that make you happy, that's great, but you may be limiting the amount of people you come in to contact with. Think about what you enjoy doing, and then go and do those things in a social way that you may find slightly uncomfortable. So if you like reading, go to a book launch, if you like boardgames, go to a game night, etc. Other people will be there also getting out of their circles and meeting people, and you want to create the most opportunities to have those little overlaps. The idea is to grow the number of people you come in to contact with to increase your chances of meeting someone. (This is essentially what online dating is, but a terrible, simplified version of it).

Obviously is this very difficult right now, but there may still be some online ways to do this. If not, maybe research things in your area that'll start back up again and commit to ""putting yourself out there"" by going. It's not easy, but it is worth it. Good luck!"

AskGirls,fqt561e,t3_gkr7ys,1589630309.0,"No. That's the short answer.

Long answer. While all the social interactions I had, family, friendships, relationships, therapists etc have helped in various ways, there was no magic moment where I felt suddenly better because of what another person did. Part of my coping mechanisms was other people, but I vary who that is as using one person is just not fair. The only consistent things I've done to improve myself are things I've done for me."
AskGirls,fqt4p9y,t3_gkrxvg,1589629884.0,"Bloody hell. First of all, you brave soul going thorough all of that and still give the world of dating a chance. I applaud you. Second, this is a bit of a difficult one to answer, but I think it should be up to you to tell them when you trust them and feel comfortable enough to reveal that. That may mean after a few months of dating, or you may have one of those first dates where you click, spend 24 hours with each other and tell each other everything. I wouldn't put it on your online profile or anything like that, but only because it's so personal and you shouldn't feel like you have to tell everyone if you don't want to."

socialskills,fq9gjgh,t3_ghkx2f,1589197553.0,"I think as a species humans are not meant to be alone, so it's natural and somewhat engrained in us to feel lonely and seek company. There will be days where you feel lonely and you just need company to make you feel better, but you have to split those days where you feel that intense longing, from the days where it would just be nice to talk to someone about things. Find things to occupy yourself with on the latter occasions, take up a hobby and do it whilst listening to the radio or watching TV, take a walk whilst listening to an audio book, something like that. If you can lessen the days where there is some loneliness and be ok in your own company, you'll feel less panicked to grab on to the nearest person who shows you interest. Then on the days where the feeling is stronger, you can reach out to friends for company whilst still knowing that there are days you don't feel like this and it does get better. If you take actions on the lesser feelings, the stronger ones won't be as bad, I hope that makes sense."

I wouldn't advise him working in the bedroom, too many issues in that, but perhaps you could have a chat with him and work out a bit of a schedule? So for example on Friday and Saturday nights he doesn't work so late and can spend time with you/go to bed at the same time, Monday he could stop everything for an hour, go for a walk with you/have lunch together, and then another night, maybe Wednesday he can pack up early sk you guys can make dinner together?

A nice clear shot of your face, one with friends, one with a pet, one doing a hobby/activity you like, one travelling/holiday/night out? A nice range. For your bio, an easy opener is listing 3 things that are unique to you/things you enjoy doing, then think about the things that you enjoy doing that you could share with someone else, e.g. trying out new recipes or going to the beach. I also think ending on a joke or a light touch is nice as everyone knows online dating is ridiculously hard. Do have. Look at everyone else profile on here to see how others do it.

If say your early 30s, it's a few dates in and your meeting in person, receiving that compliment genuinely and saying thank you would show me you have real confidence.

You bio is quite serious and doesn't really tell me lots about you. I like the bit about the phone and the procrastination joke. I don't understand why you've added a quote, is it written about you?

I work with a lot of older women, the things they've have taught me a gold. I wish if known this at 20 rather than at 30, but nevermind. At least I know it now!"
Bumble,fojle6f,t3_g704dr,1587823898.0,"100% agree with you. 3 days is plenty, if they felt it, I'm sure they'd ask to call you/video chat and take things to the next level. I've seen a lot of guys on here trying to find creative ways to keep a girl interested. I think if they are trying, you can give them the benefit of the doubt if the banter or chat perhaps isn't up to usually standards, but no messages for 3 days?! Cut that guy out, you deserve so much better than that!"
Bumble,fojkt6q,t3_g71vfi,1587823493.0,Humour is sexy. So is grammar. Two very underused things in dating profiles/conversation in my opinion!
Bumble,fojkiab,t3_g7j5ng,1587823285.0,"Let me answer this as a girl. You need 4 photos. Ideally an eye catching one - face on, next one doing something that interests you, then with with children or animals or something cute, lastly one of you dressed up/well, depending on your fashion type. Girls like to imagine, give them all the need for that. Make you bio honest but funny. Be clear in what your looking for but don't write an essay. Give us an easy conversation starter. Happy to look at your profile if you want me to. Good luck :)"
Bumble,fojk0pu,t3_g7q4ny,1587822940.0,"Could you maybe play a game together online? I'm thinking a board game? Or video call a game of snap together, (put down cards, both must match for snap etc), keep it light and keep it fun. Could also do a little pub quiz or each other or watch a game of bingo? She's finding it just as hard I'm sure, keep going! :)"

seduction,foj11bu,t1_foid0ld,1587804140.0,"Do you ever stop to consider that you get that response rate because women know that you've just swiped right on hers and 100 other profiles that night? So why should she give you the time of day? Also because we are getting so many matches, we can end up being unnecessarily picky about minor details, but if we didn't, we would end up with so many matches, where would we know how to start?! If I was to set up a dating app, it would be like bumble, but include a voice clip and a two questions, both the voice clip and the two questions would need to be listened to and answered before you can swipe right and match. That would slow men right down! 😂 Also it would mean women were more likely to respond and they know have actually given then more than 2 seconds on their time. Your last statement is completely untrue. No one should be dating anyone who expects a guy to pay for a date. If I met a guy for drinks and he offered to pay for me drink, my immediate reaction is to thank him and to tell him the next round is on me. If I went out to dinner, I would offer to split the bill 3 times. If he downright refused, then I'd accept that and thank him. I'm not saying that freeloaders aren't out there, but if that's what you've found yourself on a date with, run a mile."

seduction,fohgl1z,t1_fohdne2,1587765638.0,"I'm assuming you mean if it was the other way round and I was a guy? Obviously it's hard because I'm a girl trying to think like a guy, but I wouldn't be trying to match with every single girl out there. I'd be taking time to look through photos, reading bios, and only match ones I'm genuinely interested in. I also wouldn't spend hours on it swiping right 100 times. Instead I'd say yes to maybe 3? And leave it for a day, to see who responds.
As a girl, if I knew a guy had actually done that before saying yes, I'd be way more likely to give him the time of day. As it stands, I just have to assume they've said yes after a 2 second glance at my first photo."
dating_advice,foextyk,t3_g72bto,1587718618.0,"I've often found it's not necessary about when the sex happens, it's what happens immediately afterwards. If I like someone enough to sleep with them on a first date and they pack up their things and leave as quickly as possible, evening or next morning, that says to me that aren't interested in anything else. If they hang around for as long as physically possible, and keep being tactile, I then assume that they are in this for the long run. It's as simple as that really. If you sleep with someone on a first date and think it's a mistake because you want a relationship, don't act like it's a mistake, single  quickest way to shut it down."

seduction,fod2hpi,t3_g6u2tu,1587679025.0,"I'm a female! Number 3 by far out ranks anything else you've got up there!! You could be a broke guy, with no job, wearing clothes with holes in, but if you carry yourself with confidence and make me feel good. That's hands down a second date right there. Obviously confidence can be linked to other things, but I can't say what that would be for you as its personal. So you might feel confident after learning a new skill or buying a new shirt, but find what makes you feel good and just do more of it."
seduction,fod24cs,t3_g6un2s,1587678907.0,"Ask her if she feels comfortable with you and act on the answer. If she says she's shy, ask her what things she enjoys doing and go and do that with her. I have no idea if anything else is happening with this girl, but I went on a date with a guy I found incredibly attractive and had a really hard time because I could barely look at him when I was talking to him. Needless to say no second date! Don't write her off just yet."
seduction,fod1jg3,t3_g6urlh,1587678710.0,"This is a gift, there is literally a world of post covid-19 pick up lines waiting for you. You can ask any women if they got desperate enough during lockdown that they baked banana bread. You might have hit pause, but so has everyone else. Look back at all you've accomplished, be proud and get ready to come out stronger."
seduction,fod0vbe,t3_g6v325,1587678459.0,"Answering this from a female perspective, if she's asked you not to contact her, you need to respect that. If you're saying she's normally a chill girl and she was yelling at you down the phone for calling her, look at how much you're upsetting her. I think you need to leave it alone for a while. Like a good while, 6 weeks maybe? Then see what's happened in that time and how you feel. If after 6 weeks you want to reach out to her, it needs to be slow. Follow her on Instagram. If she let's that one go, after a week like her latest post. Another week, like something else and put a comment. If she tolerates all these things, you may have a chance of building back a friendship. I have no idea what this ex back crap is, but you're right that you need to give her space. If she's asked for that, it's the only decent thing you can do."
seduction,focz55w,t3_g6setz,1587677804.0,"This comment may not be welcome, but from my own experience, girls receive a lot more attention than guys. I'm sure there's a post somewhere about the gender divide on dating apps and it's heavily male. Just doing the maths on that means girls end up getting more attention, whether they mean to or not. I'm not saying there aren't girls out there who just chat and won't meet,  but there are also other girls wading through 100s of the same pick up lines, just trying to find someone genuine. When you scroll through, say yes to a few guys and then they all come back as a match, you then have to start working really hard to work out if any of them are what you're looking for (which is obviously a highly personal thing). Not trying to say girls can't be dicks, but it's hard for us too, just in different ways."
seduction,focxs3b,t3_g6s4sk,1587677285.0,"One word - respect. Look for it in every area. Do they respect you, themselves, their elders, their friends, strangers, their boss, their time, your time, things that are important to them, things that are important to others, etc. I'm sure there may be exceptions, but if you find someone who has respect in all areas, I can't see them also having loads of red flags."
Tinder,fobw6pt,t1_fobvjd3,1587664341.0,"Unrelated but we seem to have travelled to a number of the same places! I love the one of you feeding a wallaby and the last one with just your one friend in the shirt and tie (as it's easy to see who you are). The shot of you in the white t-shirt by the water is also a nice photo.
My choice of 4 would be photo of you at night, photo of you feeding wallaby, photo if you by Sydney opera house, photo of you in shirt. Good luck!"
Tinder,fobgesi,t3_g6hyj2,1587659525.0,"The banter was good, but don't go for sexist clichés."
Tinder,fobclpb,t1_foaks2r,1587658446.0,"I'm going to ignore the ridiculous comments you've sadly had. Unfortunately I think Tinder has become a bit of a casual ""hook up"" site. If you want a more meaningful connection, you might want to try a different site or perhaps in one of the paid ones? Or you can just put in your bio that you're looking for someone who's self respecting enough not to use pick up lines, and see who's out there that feels the same! Good luck :)"
Tinder,foba0tq,t1_foahwoe,1587657670.0,"You don't need so many, choose 4 of them. I'd personally drop the peace sign one, (it made me cringe!) And definitely have the 2nd one as your main photo."

socialskills,foah8er,t1_fo9ww31,1587646465.0,"You have to start with the group as a whole as if it's an established group, they'll make a group decision whether to let you be part of it. If you get the first approval, this is when you can start working on people individually. I mean this in the gentlest sense, when meeting as a group, try and find common ground with each of them. Something normally pop up, like one really likes going to the cinema to see sci-fi movies and the others aren't as interested. Then don't offer to go and see one with them, but proactively ask them to the cinema to see the new one. Arrange a date and go. It may be as awkward as a first date, but you have to start slow. Then keep this going whilst finding something else to do with someone else. It doesn't have to be one on one, as long as its smaller than the group. Obviously keep going to group events, but the way you become part of a group is by becoming a person that people associate with things. Then you never become dispensable, as you'll be someone's go to person."
