AskReddit,fr25job,t1_fr07h7l,1589831520.0,"Yeah I honestly don't really care too much about the canon designation. I keep them a bit separated in my mind so I sort of know what is ""actually"" going on in the SW universe...but it's all just entertainment so I don't care too much.

I'm sort of in the same boat as you are with coming back to reading star wars. I usually read nonfiction, but wanted to kind of broaden my horizons and get into some fiction, and I love star wars and I used to read star wars when I was younger (about 6 or 7 years ago) so I've been getting into that a bit. But my all-time favorites are now all ""non-canon"", but most of them don't interfere at all with new canon so I don't worry too much about it. But if you haven't read these, I would HIGHLY recommend them (I think they mostly came out within the past 10-ish years. I'm only 22 so my ""old timer"" stuff is still pretty recent haha)

-Plaguis - absolutely awesome. Basically about young Palpatine and his apprenticeship to Darth Plaguis. It has a nice balance between a lot of political intrigue/power plays and Sith mythology. Haven't read it in like 6 years but just got a new copy!

-Death Troopers- I'm sure you've read it haha

-All 4 Republic Commando novels + the Imperial Commando sequel

Also I started listening to the new Obi-Wan/Qui Gon book Master and Apprentice. It's on youtube and it's pretty good if you want a free listen"

dating_advice,fqun5k2,t3_gkyxp2,1589661558.0,"I don't mean to be an ass, but you sound very young and maybe inexperienced. Actual love takes years to build and sustain. Obviously, most people who ""love"" each other don't really, or don't know what true love is. The VAST VAST VAST majority of relationships don't last very long relatively speaking. Especially the ones where people claim to be in love very early on

Beyond that, everyone says it's better to be alone than to date someone you are in love with but I genuinely believe that in today's world, that isn't sustainable. I was in two relationships in high school, one was like 3 months, one was a year. In the 3.5 years since high school I haven't been in a relationship and that is one of the worst ways to go about your young life I think. Not only does it add to the frustration of not being intimate with someone but you are also missing out on experiencing and learning about other people and you miss a vital part of learning the social landscape. 

I used to be one of the most idealistic romantics out there, but now I firmly believe it is better to just go out and date whomever is willing when and where you can, and learn about yourself and others, so if and when you DO find someone worthy of your love and willing to love you, you have the basic intuition and experience to not drive that relationship into the ground

I'm not sure it I am an INTP, but I am starting to think I am (as opposed to ENTP), and this sounds so much like me. Honestly, if you ever want to message me or something and talk about some of this stuff that sounds like it might do us both some good to chat with someone with such similar anxieties and perceived limitations and who also views it in such a deep existential way.

Like it's crazy how you described your thoughts and feelings on love and relationships. I am so terrible at relationships, and yet it's one of the only non-intellectual things I think and feel about almost constantly. Everyone says I am attractive and good looking and I have no trouble getting numbers or dates but holy shit it's just like I can't get on the same wavelength as the rest of the world :/

And then the way you describe wanting to do battle with all the things that are holding you back from your own evolution, and knowing how you *should* or *could* do it, but it just doesn't happen. And instead you are left with a crippling sense of stagnation and restlessness. I feel like that with EVERYTHING.

The more I dig, it seems that people don't really assign the ""gay"" label to me, but it wouldn't surprise them in the slightest to hear that I was gay, if that were the case. When I ask people who know me, it seems like I am just a combination of very expressive, but also reserves and thoughtful, which I guess is rare for stereotypical guys. Most straight guys are ""assumed"" to be either very introverted and dry, or very expressive/aggressive/ domineering. Whereas I guess the gay stereotype is someone who is very open and expressive, but also feminine and conscientious. So, like other people have mentioned, it's not that people actively think I am gay, but don't jump to ""this is the straightest guy in the room"", maybe it's the same for you? 

Also.....take this with a grain of salt...I have found that if you are a very good-looking guy, and also intelligent, but that you aren't someone who dates or sleeps around, people WILL start to wonder.

Part of the larger problem with society is that we are told we are entitled to happiness. But this jsn't true. Every wise man knows that we are only entiteled the ""Pursuit of happiness"", and within the pusruit, is where happiness is.

Anybody who isn't out there attacking life from every direction, giving it their all, isn't going to be happy. Get outside, start a skills-acquisition project, do things that scare the shit out of you. 

Just have fun with this one life you have been given. Or don't. 

Good luck.

This is the way."
AskMen,fam6t8h,t1_fam4450,1576196953.0,"I honestly wish I could go to my recruiter and just say ""pick a job for me, sign me up, and I'll reassess in 3 years"" but they don't really do that anymore lol"
AskMen,fam6l1j,t1_fam4450,1576196801.0,"Hey, thanks for the response! So actually military isn't one of my ""biggest"" decisions, but honestly it is currently the one I probably care the most about, so I'm really excited someone like yourself responded. Maybe you can help me out a bit.

So my problem is honestly that I have too many options available. I have wanted to join since I was probably 15. I got a 91 on my ASVAB and I am interested in all the branches and many many jobs. I am trying to, for the time being, do a reserve component and finish school. So within those constraints, I'm looking at Army Guard, Air Guard, or Army reserves.  In my state, national guard pays 100% of tuition. Reserves does not. But reserves has some jobs I REALLY want to do (Think PSYOPs). Also, Air National Guard seems like a sweet gig, but both Air Guard and Army reserves are 6 year commitments....so if I want to go Active or switch branches, I'm kind of stuck. Army Guard has 3 year commitments with reenlistment bonuses. So that seems like the most logical choice for me for now.

Now for jobs...I really don't know. I am interested in 19D cav scouts. But with a 91 asvab, I've been told that would be a stupid decision. To me it seems like it would be fun, and if I go officer later, having some time in the trenches would male me a better leader. Also, being a scout just sounds badass to me, and there are deployment opportunities. HOWEVER my knees kind of suck as it is, and I've heard that if you have crappy joints, or weren't a sports kid, you should stay away from combat arms. So I am scared of getting to basic and hurting myself or breaking something and then being out for good. So then with that reasoning, my mind is like ""okay, well maybe go the safest route then.....join the Air Force and get a job with great training with that 91 asvab!""

I've actually done both Army and Air Force ROTC, but didn't really feel like administrative stuff was anything I wanted to do. And I went to MEPS a year ago, but shortly after dislocated my kneecap, so had to put it off until now. 

It's crazy! I just really wamt to serve, and I really want the benefits, and the experiences....but the more I overthink the decision the more time goes by. And I know I can switch up later, or shoot for special ops PSYOPs after school or become an officer down the road. The next 3 years DOESN'T MATTER. But alas.......as you can see, my mind is not meant for decision-making....

Sorry for all that. Just thought I'd try to throw some of my thought processes down and see what sticks"

remoteviewing,faikim0,t1_fagc0t7,1576110059.0,"Hey thanks for the reply. Yeah I agree about seeing other peoples' comments. I too try not to look at all at the other comments. So I just thought it was cool to get the impression of a rocket launch, and then look at other comments that say things resembling a tower structure, mechanical or lots of cables or grid patterns, light and the color white or black/grays, AND that so many also seem to have the impression of a large body of water! So that to me is pretty nifty! I just really hope the OP shows up and shows us the target!

Also I think even if we are all way off the mark, it is very intriguing that we did seem to have commonalities. I think that phenomenon deserves more research! Too bad this isn't a ""real science"" yet.

And as for being intimidated, don't worry about it!! Honestly, I don't think anyone here is that skilled. And how could they be? There seems to be this gift. We can sort of tap into it, and for whatever reason, something led each of us here. to studying or playing around with this. But at the same time, right now it is like trying to establish the NFL and play football, thousands of years in the future, if all we have to go by is a commercial someome found on an old, broken iphone!! Haha, we are really stumbling around in the dark just trying to fit these pieces together, when there is sooooo little research being done on this and other ESP and Psychic phenomena, while at the same time, our modern psychology is in a completely different environment than that of our ancient evolutionary ancestors. So hopefully we are getting closer and closer to understanding and developing these abilities, but you should consider yourself just as capable as anyone else, as lomg as you put in the effort, belief and practice!"

AskReddit,faa61w7,t3_e87wos,1575903123.0,"Start reading a new book (I prefer non-fiction). If you haven't read for a while, or have never been into reading, you will be surprised how difficult it may feel, but just get through some pages and don't judge yourself or get irritable

I'm 21 and while I've always been smart and curious, I never had the attention span or discipline to get enjoyment out of reading. I have started to get more and more into it over the past 1.5--2 years, and it was honestly a struggle at first. I now read almost every single day and feel like something is missing from my day if I haven't spent some quiet time with a book or two, learning new things.

***I know, audiobooks ROCK...but I highly recommend getting into reading hardcopy books. Audibooks give you the same info or entertainment, but like everything else in our lives, rarely require real concentration or solitude. Getting into the habit of holding a physical book, and needing a semi-quiet place in space and time, and actually engaging your brain with reading, becomes an amazing exercise after a couple weeks of getting a bit bored or distracted. I honestly now am thinking about becoming a reading tutor because of how much I advocate this as something everyone could use in their lives. As cheesy as it sounds, reading really can take you all kinds of new places, wherever you want to go in that moment!"
mbti,fa75c2j,t1_fa3vrbr,1575831569.0,"I relate very much to what you've said, and how you've said it. It makes me depressed at times, and even makes me enraged at times (more at my personal relationship to the Universe than to anyone out there). But, I'm almost 22, and I am coming more and more to the realization that, should one continue down that path, one becomes the darkest form of human creature. Uncle Ben was right in saying with great power comes great responsibility. And someone else (idk who lol) was right in saying knowledge is power. 

*NOBODY* who is very smart and self aware, has it easy. But, both the greatest things ever conducted by our species -those things that make us tear up and feel we may redeem ourselves before God himself- AND the most despicable- those things which, when we see, we wonder why ANY of us should be allowed to exist on this planet, let alone be allowed to inhabit this grand universe- These things both have been devised and made manifest by the truly intelligent, self-aware people of our species.

So yeah, being smart and self-aware sucks. It's a gift. But it's not a gift made for fun. It comes with an enormous burden. So, either way you are an alien observer on this planet, but you can either come to terms with that and learn to accept others for the unique, miracles of biology and psychology that they are, and work to become a leader or teacher: a ""shepard"".......or you can resent the world for not inviting you to more parties with the cool kids. One of these paths can lead to a life worth living, and happiness, and one of these paths will inevitably lead to a life of hate, suffering and unworthiness"
