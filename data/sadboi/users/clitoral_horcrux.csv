They have to leave all buildings on their ranch unlocked otherwise the windows will get smashed or the doors broken in for illegals to go shelter in there.  Sometimes the buildings will still get damaged because the immigrants won't even check that they were unlocked first.  Illegals cut their fences all the time, or border patrol does going after illegals, then they get fined for their cattle getting out on the road.  When you have \~50,000 acres you can't check all your fence every day.  Additionally, they said that in the past 10 years the attitude of the people coming across has changed drastically.  Many are now very entitled instead of humble and grateful like they used to experience.  One example--recently an illegal was coming through with the boots falling off her feet, so the lady I know gave the illegal a pair of boots she still actively used on the ranch.  The illegal got angry and said these are trash and threw them down.  Also many are selling children for money.  You can buy a Mexican kid for $100 there no problem."
Athens,f7hie8o,t1_f7gca6j,1573741272.0,"Lol just because more black people are arrested for marijuana doesn't mean that it's because of any racial bias.  Maybe black people in general tend to be less discrete in their usage and possession of it?  Maybe they tend to drive around while smoking more than other demographics?  Since most of the demographic of the poor areas is black people, they're most likely going to be driving cars in worse shape with problems that could give cops a reason to pull them over as well, such as broken turn signals, brake lights, or even expired tags.  Also back to the poverty, areas with higher poverty, especially around Athens, have by far the highest crime rates.  This means that cops are going to be focusing on those areas more.  Since the majority of the population in those areas is black, that means if someone is doing something they're not supposed to they're much more likely to get noticed and that will be a black person.  When cops show up for disputes and smell weed, that's going to give them an excuse.  Those are just a few quick thoughts off the top of my head that are likely possibilities.

I mean, how do you draw the line at a frivolous product?  Would you really want someone in the government saying, ok you can't sell shoes over $100?  Man what a slippery slope that would be.

Of course dumbasses do buy them, but I don't think they should be prevented from wasting their $$ if they want to.  Instead of people bitching about capitalism, people should be bitching about people being shallow and materialistic, and about just doing the right thing.  I have many problems with how many corporations work, like CEOs making absurd amounts and taking huge bonuses while the company is doing poorly and claiming nobody can get raises and/or laying people off.  Like the bankers that still took huge bonuses in 2009 when their banks failed. WTF, over!?  My wife worked for a company that built a new building and the CEO was such a cheapskate he cut corners everywhere, one of which being the HVAC system so that it couldn't ever properly heat/cool the place, yet he took millions in bonuses and had multiple exotic cars.  Sorry, but a fraction of one of those cars could have covered having proper fucking AC in the building.  I don't think that's something that should be legislated though, I think that just needs more societal recognition, shaming, and even protests.

AskReddit,f6p6r7a,t3_dseo62,1573049000.0,Some Russian kids torturing a homeless man.  Jabbing screwdrivers into him and beating him with a hammer and shit.  One of the few videos I haven't been able to finish.

Justrolledintotheshop,f2zzlz2,t1_f2xoyb3,1570542876.0,"Yeah that's close to what I was getting at.  Many people never take any kind of risks and never get the reward you can from taking the risks.  They live their life in fear and don't experience many things because of it.  For ex,  so many people get sports cars and never even floor them, or might do so once and drive them like a pussy.  What's the point!?  I respect the hell out of people doing what they're passionate about, even if it's dangerous.  Die with your boots on is a reference to what Doc Holiday said as another poster mentioned, and a song by Iron Maiden."
Justrolledintotheshop,f2wxebr,t3_demhwy,1570471310.0,Damn!  That's what I wanna see instead of a fucking burnout vid.  Sucks to hear the dude lost his life though.  Sounds like he went out with his boots on not living life like a pussy at least.

AskReddit,f28dnrv,t1_f278dgv,1570058888.0,I've been there and it's beyond unfortunate when you do have to rely on someone like that.  The best I can tell you is to suck it up until you can get out on your own then never look back. Be smart and don't do anything that will fuck your life up despite how badly you may hate him.  I know I certainly fantasized about doing horrible things to my dad.  I also treated it as motivation to make sure I succeeded well enough I'd never have have to come crawling back to my parents.
AskReddit,f28d8p8,t3_dc9r0p,1570058580.0,"I've cut both my parents out of my life and don't regret it one bit.  They are incredibly toxic, and every interaction I had with them just left me feeling depressed after I left the house.  That's aside from my dad being emotionally abusive to me and my siblings as children and my mom never trying to stop him.  They are truly some of the most horrible people I've ever met and cutting them out has done nothing but make my life better."
