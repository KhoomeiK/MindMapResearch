Let's make this really clear:

Genetic engineering: Changing a specific handful of genes with a specific goal in mind

Other methods of genetic modification: Changing tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of genes in the hopes of getting to a specific goal and not knowing what other changes me be made in the process"

You are *genetically* different than your parents because you get your *genes* from both of them.

A Pomsky is a crossbreed of a Pomeranian and a Husky, thus their *genes* are *modified* by incorporating the *genetics* of both breeds.

Meyer lemons are a *genetic* hybrid of traditional lemons and Mandarin oranges, so they contain *genetic* traits of both.
