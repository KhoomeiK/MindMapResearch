tressless,fr292eb,t3_gm6whd,1589833246.0,"1) Heightened anxiety for the first week due to my trepidation with beginning the drug. I also had brain fog the first week, but had had it for a couple days before beginning fin. I got back on my exercise regime consistently and felt better than ever on fin.
The only transient side that I believe fin did cause was testicle soreness, which was on and off from about week 2-3. It did get significantly painful one day (6/10) but was very slight other than that.

2)Generics aren’t any better regarding their efficacy, however they can often be more cost effective.

3)I’m only a month in right now and am still on the generic that I began on.

Good luck!"

Also what do you mean because of the diffuse thinning you got seb Derm? More exposure to the sun or something like that?"

Beginning of the second week I had some testicle and groin pain that went away after about 3 days and hasn’t come back. I also had one orgasm that felt different, like incomplete. That only happened once though and I’m not sure I can even attribute that to finasteride. 
I’m currently shedding a lot, but I already was before I started (2nd minoxidil shed I think) Overall I feel very hopeful and plan to continue using. Also my sex drive almost doubled."

\-History- When you first noticed an how it has progressed so far

\-What you have Tried So Far:

\-Other Causes You think it may be

\-Concerns you have about common hair loss drugs

\-etc.

That being said, an experienced doctor isn't going to make a different diagnosis or recommendation just because you forgot some bit of info. I'm 99% sure he'll recommend fin and minoxidil, but we will see. Good Luck!"

I began shedding after a week and it stopped  being so dramatic about week 3 for the most part. I already see a significant amount of regrowth beginning. I will post my 1 month update pics soon. I feel like I occasionally get a bit more light headed after use, but I also have anxiety so it might just be that lol."
tressless,fb5ys67,t3_ebg014,1576537176.0,To me it sounds like your biggest issue right now is consistency. Once your consistent you can really begin to gather whether your current regimen is actually effective or needs to be changed.
tressless,fabcmra,t3_e8be4a,1575921177.0,I take saw palmetto in pill form and I believe that it has mildly slowed shedding.

Today this tall white girl with a fat ass was checking me out in the gym and even walked right by me... and I never said anything!  Best believe I thought about it and overthought about it and then bitched out. I'm making a promise to myself that next time I see her at the gym I will approach. Rejection would honestly feel better than the disappointment I feel with myself right now.

productivity,f6ojagq,t3_ds0r7o,1573019968.0,"So I tried it... and really liked it! It was brief, but not too brief and it took away my need for control I often experience when feeling  anxiety. Instead of going to youtube to find a meditation on youtube and then clicking between videos to find the ""highest rated"" and ""most beneficial one"", I simply let the app guide me. It didn't work a miracle or anything, but it helped lower my anxiety levels and I plan on consistently using this when under peak stress and anxiety levels to see how it helps!"

Anxiety,eot8yw9,t3_bt22ex,1558837046.0,"I just had this thought. I am often very critical and quick to judge my internal battles and anxieties. With something like getting out of bed in the morning when it feels like hell, I would have little compassion for myself, but if I had anxiety about giving a speech or something ""worthwhile"" to feel anxious about I would say that it's ""understandable"".   Anxiety isn't always logical and it won't always make since in the context of how our society says we are supposed to function. So when I say that ""it should be easy"" I am just lacking self- love. Any act of bravery in the midst of anxiety should be affirmed no matter how small or big, because the consistent disciplined acts of pushing past your anxieties will ultimately make us better. We won't always succeed, but it's the combination of small victories over time that improve us even when the setbacks feel paralyzing.

\-Peace and love to all you are not alone"
