You're doing very well keeping chemicals out of your body. I understand, too, that medications are hit or miss. However, meds are important, especially if you're feeling irritable.

EVConversion,f4e3vh7,t1_f4dtmb8,1571551735.0,"If you undervolt a 3ph motor without changing the stator windings or rotor cage you'll lose torque due to the increased rotor slip and lost efficiency, especially if it's an asynchronous AC motor. Even with a higher frequency, you'll have a small window where all of the losses in the copper will just turn to heat. You should expect at least 42A if there 100% efficiency. 

The torque T (Nm) equals the product of Power (W) * Angular Frequency (9.5488rad/s, it's a conversion constant) Ã· Speed (RPM). 

Your motor: T(Nm) = 4000W * 9.5488 Ã· 1380RPM = 27.68Nm."
EVConversion,f4drwkd,t3_dk35p0,1571546678.0,"Continuous and peak motor torque @ ""X"" RPMs  is your best gauge of performance. Start with the mass of your bike in kg, mine was 172kg, and the 0 - 100km/h time you want. Let's say, 0 to 100km/h in 5 seconds. 100km/h is 27.778m/s. 
 Acceleration: a = v Ã· t = 27.778m/s Ã· 5s = 5.55m/sÂ²
 Force Needed: F = m * a = 172kg * 5.55m/sÂ² = 954.6N
 Lastly, divide the needed Force by your wheel radius in meters to get the torque needed at the wheel. (My 160/60R17 rear was .625m in diameter.)
 Torque on Wheel: T = 954.6N Ã· .3125m = 3055Nm

So, with that, it will take 3055Nm of torque on the rear wheel to accelerate my 172kg machine from 0 to 100km/h in 5 seconds. My Motenergy ME1003 DC motor can do 108Nm peak for 1 minute, so now let's add my sprockets: 10T front, 45T rear (and the transmission ratio too in your case):
 45T:10T = 4.5:1 ratio * 108Nm = 486Nm of torque, divided by wheel radius is 486Nm Ã· .3125 = 1555Nm. 

This will give me a ""zero to sixty"" of 9 seconds. The original bike did that in 3.2s but hey, my motor was 1/3 the size and weighed only 40lbs."
