BPD,fr36k3y,t1_fa9s68d,1589850961.0,"Same thing with my FP. We were both straight men. 

I don't know what happened but he definitely had some other things going on sexually because our relationship went down that path. Actually, kinda hurts to say but I'm pretty sure he was just fucking with me to see how far he could get me to go along with it.

9 months. 6 months of deep emotional connection. He had made jokes about us together romantically for that entire period. Then we had a 1 month secret relationship that got physical  (massaging/foreplay). Then 2 months of him telling me it didn't mean anything all while we still were connected emotionally and while he kept sending me photos and discussing our future 3 way. Then harassing me. Then just calling me slut. 

I would have never realized something was wrong with me had I not entered a codependent relationship with someone else who likely has anither Cluster B disorder."
