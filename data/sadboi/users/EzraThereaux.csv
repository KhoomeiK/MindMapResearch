With the booming influx of people, especially those from the west coast, the market is in it's highest demand for trade work I've ever seen, so I can't complain too much. It's also extremely costly to rent or own a home here. Most people are relatively friendly, so making friends isn't as much work as in other places. However, my sights are set on the more rural areas of Texas, of which Austin is not. So it depends on your goals and how you want to structure your life, whether the costs outweigh the benefits. Traffic is indeed terrible, but it can be mitigated with proper planning."

If you are focused on the present moment and accomplishing small tasks to build towards your own personal goals, it's amazing. I can start whatever project or business that I want, and with right knowledge *and willpower*, no one can bother me. No one can stop me. 

If you're focused only on the bullshit that exists in men's heads; corporate media and politics, lgbtq rights and gender equality; law, legislature and the economy; focusing more on the past and future than this moment, America is a terrible place to be. 

It's a mental game, what's going on here, a fight to couple living people with fictional entities and use that marriage to subvert intellect, rights, and personal power; to divert personal power and attention away from the individual and their right to elevate their experience, and into commerce - funneling that energy from the people to value it least, to those who value it most, by pulling the wool over eyes of the confused. Exacerbating that by continually confusing the masses. 

A human farm.

That said, in a world of absolute truth, you can only be what you are. In a world made of lies, you can be anything. Pauper or king. The key is in knowing that truth automatically refutes the lies; it's infinitely more powerful, and the lies are just the games that truth plays.

America is only the figurehead of this game, where the amplitude and stakes are higher and the matches have worldwide media coverage, but the same game is being played out every where on this plane. It just isn't as visible."

awakened,f2uecuo,t3_de5b39,1570414369.0,"Agreed. The marriage contract isn't a contract between the woman and the man, though they says the vows to one another. The contract is between each individual and the state. The state is using the individual's fear of loss, the fear of love going away, and fear of being alone, as an opportunity to step in and lay claim to the family's assets in the (in this cultural climate) inevitable case of divorce. That's why the judge can tell you what to do with your children, why they can divide your property. Why many men lose their children to their ex wife, because child support pays the state, who gets an incentive payment of  $.99 on the dollar for every dollar collected from the federal office of child support for running their service. It doesn't mater who, though, as long as someone is paying. In Blessing v. Freestone, it was ruled that the program creates no individual rights and was never intended to benefit families, but for the state's recoupment of welfare expenditures. 

It isn't so that men can possess women, but so that the state can possess the people.

Real love is like tending a garden. The flowers may wither and fade, but only if you don't water them or pay attention to them. Even still, new flowers can grow from the old, and new seeds planted at any time. It takes only your attention to cultivate that beautiful garden, just like your attention feeds you relationship."

I don't think that there is a way to simplify it without miscommunication, since every concept is built upon another. This blog post is very much in-depth on the matter: https://infjblog.com/breaking-down-the-8-cognitive-functions-of-the-infj/

The thing the intrigues me most, is that, as an INFJ develops cognitively, they will test differently in different stages of their development. In developing their Introverted iNtuition (childhood to early 20s), they may test as an INFP. Then as an INTJ, or something else. I think people should take that into consideration, that, as your perception grows or changes, your personality may change in response."
