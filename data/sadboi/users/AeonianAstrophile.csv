You cheated on your girlfriend and you feel guilty, that's completely okay. Sometimes our brain makes us do things like that but it's all okay. And I think if you tell your girlfriend, she might be angry for a while but if you love her she'll be back and nothing can stop it.

You're right you can live for your mom and your girlfriend, they are your power, your anchor, think of them when you feel depressed and they will help you through.

You're a good man and if you want to talk you can always text me."
