EDAnonymous,f9muljv,t3_e5v7fb,1575470626.0,i totally get this!! i find myself in your position a lot where i switch from binging to eating normally to restricting and back around again. i feel like i don’t fit into either of the extremes because i bounce between them so often i just keep thinking i have disordered eating because i don’t stay in one phase for a long period of time which makes it hard for me to relate to some people’s stories.
