queensuniversity,fogciz8,t1_foeglz0,1587750823.0,thank you! does Adelaide ever have parties though? and which residence is better for a double loft ?
queensuniversity,fodobs9,t3_fuxlp4,1587687156.0,"hi ! I have a couple of questions!   

First, would you recommend Adelaide or McNeill more? I want to be able to have close resources, a decently quiet space and just... room to make friends.

Secondly, I read that there's only 2 guests / bed owner permitted -- how long are the guests allowed to stay?"
IAmA,fm6nhel,t3_ekkmva,1585798231.0,"this might seem quite personal, but I'm planning to audition next year and I don't have a lot of money. -- How do you pay for school?"

highschool,ewr3shk,t3_ck6054,1565693197.0,"Honestly girl, I was the same way junior year (last year) except it was with Uni level math. I failed it cause my teacher was horrible, and then I switched to mixed but my depression was really bad. I wouldn’t even show up to class because I couldn’t get out of bed or I’d have panic attacks not even 10 minutes after class started. I did the same thing, tried taking it in the summer but it drained me, so I dropped it. Now I’m planning to retake it in the fall, semester 1. You’re not alone, we had to do what we had to do, our mental health is a priority and if I can do it, you can. You’ll most likely be placed in a class with others a year below you or with others who failed the course and decided to retake it. That’s the only thing; just remember to communicate with your teacher if you misunderstand something and try your best. Message me if you need someone to talk to. x"
