Extremely weird and dark sense of humor. His lectures would be punctuated by tangents but rich of practical and theoretical content. He would most likely sit on a table or desk while teaching and slouch somewhat. His exams would primarily be short answer and encourage his students to use unusual or unique approaches to tactical thinking. The content of his battle command would more closely resemble a chess game than anything else. 

He gives off the impression of not giving a single fuck about anything, but in reality he knows he can't drop his guard, being highly suspicious of Rhea and her true intentions. 

Canonically, he's at home with both the Black Eagles (CF) and Golden Deer. His ""canon"" class is Dark Knight.

Female Byleth is a little more sincere, patient, and compassionate, but her fuse is much shorter. She is warmer and less lackadaisical. Like male Byleth, she's incredibly intelligent and sarcastic at times, but she applies her smarts more outwardly. Her lectures would be often long and complicated, but she'd be happy to parse down content for her individual students if they put forth the effort. She would stand while teaching and pace a bit. Her exams would be longer and probably more multiple choice-driven. She acknowledges the Church's shortcomings but knows that it would cause more harm than good to completely dismantle it, so being Archbishop of a reformed Church is her best move. Male Byleth, being a staunch opponent of theocracy, would want it gone completely. She would be a stricter general overall, but more sensitive to the needs of her students.

She would fit in best with the Black Eagles (SS) and the Blue Lions. Her ""canon"" class is Falcon Knight."

fireemblem,f9b85wj,t3_e45mnk,1575210145.0,"My biggest gripe with Leonie is her compulsion to mention Jeralt in nearly *every single goddamn line of dialogue she has*.

They're among my favorite supports in the game. 

Leonie is more than tolerable to me post-timeskip, but she's hard for me to not be irritated by beforehand. 

I think I have trouble picturing *why* she's so obsessed with Jeralt. Him helping her village and briefly taking her on as an apprentice shouldn't ordinarily be enough to develop such a profound attachment to him. She would have to have been extremely impressionable as a kid/young teen, especially since I don't consider Jeralt to be *that* interesting of a character, or even that much of a benefactor. He's shrouded in mystery even after everything we learn about him. While Jeralt doesn't seem too bothered by her presence near him at the monastery, I want to know the exact circumstances that made her this way.

As a unit, she's really good. Probably the best potential cavalry unit. She's up there with Petra and Felix for sure."

INTP,f6xebkf,t3_dt9pju,1573247850.0,"Well, my girlfriend is an INFP-T. I've noticed some differences in our preferences and how we approach certain phenomena:

\- With books, she prefers fiction and intricately-crafted stories. She seeks out books that will give her an emotional response or allow her to immerse herself into their worlds. I prefer poetry and creative nonfiction. With the former, I prefer syntactical uniqueness, complicated, scientific-sounding language, and unusual words/images as opposed to any emotional or beautiful imagery. Too much saccharine content in a piece of text steers me away from it. With her it's the opposite.

\- She thinks the best of people and is genuinely moved by their stories. She usually presses people for details about their lives and experiences, whereas I tend to stay in the background and only chime in if I find the conversation stimulating. I prefer conversations about theories and trivial facts than emotional or anecdotal ones.

\- When I'm stressed about something, her first instinct is to tell me my feelings are valid and that she's happy to listen. Her aim is to figure out how a given experience makes others feel. I'm more solution and logic-oriented. It's not that I'm unsympathetic (and I certainly do support her emotionally), but rather I find it easier to maintain a degree of distance when helping others. That way, I don't need to lose myself in the process, if that makes sense.

\- Speaking of supporting others, my girlfriend is relentless in doing so. She is fiercely loyal to her friends and will always be the first to speak out when she feels they are endangering themselves. She feels very defeated if she can't change someone she knows for the better and will feel guilty for days afterward. I approach the same issue with more of an ""I'll help, but you are in charge of your own actions"" attitude, I think.

\- She has a more developed spiritual compass. 

\- She's freaked out by horror and gore. I find it fascinating. 

\- I am extremely indecisive because my brain constantly buzzes and grapples with the pros and cons of each choice even though I generally don't feel drawn to any particular one. I usually default to what she feels like and it works out."
