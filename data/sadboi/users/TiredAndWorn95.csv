totalwar,fkpc6bp,t1_fko2rlq,1584406646.0,Beastmen are great.  I highly recommend them. Not having to manage settlements and just razing vast swathes of the map is quite good fun. They are the easiest to keep a long campaign going with in WH1. IMO at least.
depression,fjseino,t1_fjsce93,1583596241.0,"You're welcome. I wish people would just be honest and make a clean break instead of talking absolute crap like this in order to make themselves seem like they are being virtuous or something.  


This is why I gave up on dating, very few people I meet are willing to show an ounce of selflessness or commitment these days.  
Better off lonely than in a loveless, one-sided relationship I guess. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
depression,fjr6kfy,t1_fjo8j4a,1583582061.0,"> I love too much

When someone tells you this it almost always means that that person is selfish. Relationships are about compromise, and selfish people are unwilling to extent their effort to supporting and loving another person rather than just themselves."
depression,fiznmd9,t3_fahsd2,1582868010.0,"I'm almost glad that my depression has been quite constant (Although severe) for the last 10 years. I would have offed myself long ago if I constantly thought I was doing better and then came crashing down, over and over."
depression,fh1vw45,t3_f0xv2a,1581225810.0,"Don't make the mistake of thinking that having a partner will fix anything, you often crash even harder than before, when the ""Honeymoon Phase"" is over. Personally,   
constant sadness has just scared away anyone who would be a potential partner anyway, so I've given up on ever having another one.     :/"
depression,fghyl7b,t3_eyi3a0,1580798060.0,"Yes, but the conversations are usually me giving someone a piece of my mind more often than not. I'm pretty lonely, but I've accepted that I'm better of just being a hermit instead of being around others. I just embarrass myself whenever I open my mouth IRL :/  ."
unpopularopinion,fe1q2ro,t3_en52cm,1578829557.0,"I have OCD. I've actually been around people who glorify their idea of OCD and say crap like "" Oooh I have such bad OCD!"" just because they like symmetry, (everyone does btw) but look what happens they see even the minor symptoms actually present themselves in a person. Its not their cartoony, purely positive version of OCD, its a all-consuming anxiety that is extremely embarrassing to the sufferer and those around them, and they run away real fast when they actually see it."
depression,fbow5og,t3_edpkii,1577015134.0,"Yep, I snap at people for the tiniest reasons. The people that I haven't already pushed away, have gone because I lose my mind when I get angry (which is all the time).  
Also seeing successful, people ,happy people, or people in relationships makes me super angry, super fast. Basically because I know I'll never have anything close to that."
depression,f54lxb4,t3_dmfjk3,1571986210.0,"I gave up on ever having another partner. I'm too broken and empty for anyone to actually love.Every time someone has gotten close since my last partner (years ago), they immediately run the other direction when they get to know me. I've been like this for a decade now, and I know I'll always be screwed up.  
Why bother anymore?"
depression,ez7e19p,t3_czo1ne,1567722364.0,You would think that the suicides of so many major celebrities over the years would make people understand that having lots of money and stuff will only bring you so much satisfaction.
depression,eyygvvm,t3_czadw0,1567586624.0,"I wish I could have enjoyed my youth, I have very few fond memories as a child and none as a teenager. Wish I could have enjoyed life a little bit before the misery started. It seems like it was 99.99% loneliness and sadness.  
It makes me even more depressed knowing it'll only continue to get worse until I finally have the balls to off myself."
depression,ew05ot6,t3_cm28m0,1564976556.0,"I haven't spoken face to face with another person in 6 months. I'm an heavy Introvert (Not shy though), and prefer my own company, but depression has upgraded me to basically a hermit."
depression,evizx4m,t3_cjujhd,1564552816.0,"I reckon that its because these people are willing to screw over others to get what they want. They'll lie, cheat and, steal to get what they want. Naturally you are going to be more successful that way I guess.  
You obviously aren't like that, so I guess you can take a little solace in that.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
depression,eviy258,t3_cjo7ts,1564551705.0,"You can never win with these people.

Being noticeably depressed: Annoying and negative  
Smiling through the pain: Being fake.  


I don't even bother with friends or people anymore. Not worth the trouble of feeling even worse about yourself because you can't please people."
depression,evhrcrx,t1_evgq861,1564530971.0,It correlates more to people that have resting bitch face. I look really grumpy when my face is completely neutral and strangers tell me that shit all the time.

Thank you very much for the information Sir/Madam!"
totalwar,eswcr8f,t1_eswcjqe,1562312987.0,"Cool, Thanks. How do you feel about the unit roster? Are the factions diverse enough that they actually feel different?"
