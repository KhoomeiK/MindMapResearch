My best friend is an isfp and she understands the way my brain works but hers works different than mine bc she lives way more in the moment and i will just think about everything (not in an anxious way).

im14andthisisdeep,forijib,t1_forhsrc,1588012825.0,Yeah its more of self harming your future you. It might not affect you now but maybe when youre not depressed anymore or still idk. You maybe got addicted to smoking and you did this to yourself bc you thought you deserved it. Most people find smoking very disgusting especially at the beginning so that some have to puke/get dizzy/ hyperventilate (only if the person is very sensetive to that) /shiver etc. especially just breathing the smoke in is so disgusting and they do this to themselves. As self harming you know? You just wish that you would die a little bit earlier when yoire too weak to do it now. Yk what i mean?

mbti,fonmlmn,t1_fonkpql,1587922383.0,"Btw i really am not native speaking but sometimes i misclick and im to blind to see it.

1.i meant did god create earth or did he create the entire universe?

2. Oki thanks! So god only controlls what will happen after our lifes? Bc i heard that god already planned our life but in order to do that doesn't that mean that he planned all of the general horror like having traumas etc?

3. Oki

4. I know it isnt just an invention just for that but i meant like religion back when it started was so useful bc it gave people a purpose and a system and less fear of the death and less sadness when someone died bc dead back then was extremely common and its just a way to cope. Its easier to think that they wont suffer anymore and are in a better place than thinking that they as a person dont really exist anymore.

5. Oki.

6. I know that but a lot of people say god wants this god wants that and they dont have the prove from it in the bible. Oh and why wont god talk to us now bc wr developed a lot and everything is changing. So why shouldnt god talk to us again and ""update"" some stuff

7. Ok thanks"
mbti,fong9zf,t1_foned4i,1587918921.0,Thing is thats why i have so many questions. I never had religion class in school bc i chose ethics and no one really around me is religious. So yeah thats why i have sok many questions. Not necessarily to make themselves question their religion. I just want information
mbti,fonfjbn,t1_fonewjk,1587918516.0,"Aww thanks.

So ok.

 1. Question. Did world creat earth or the universe?

2. Does god controll everything?

3. How do you know what god wants? Are there even any proves?

4. Isnt religion just an invention to make people less afraid of death? I mean if someone dies its almost impossible to realize that the person isn't someone anymore but something and to think that thwy still live somewhere else is mire satisfying and relieving and less hurtfull i think.

5. If jesus died for our sins doesn't that meab that you can be the cruelstes most horrible abusive person in the entire world and youre a serial killer, child molester etc and they will just forgive you? I only forgive people if they changed.

6. How can god communicate with us when he isn't human but is still often portrayed as smth humanoid?

7. Why does God only ""protect"" humans and not animals? Are they less worth?"

I wanted to know whats ur mbti type bc i was curious. Mbti is a personality system and there are some online tests to figure your type out but the 16 personalities test is bad and the most inaccurate. Mbti is based on cognitive functions who are scientifically proven. So it makes a lot of sense. Most tests are based on cognitive functions for example idrlabs and 2key. My type for example is an infp. An mbti type is based on 4 letters and there are 8 to describe them. Those 8 are E/i S/N F/T P/J. I could go on with this but it takes a lot of time. If you want to just take the test or do your own research."

rant,fnoc1f4,t3_g2sdvu,1587119936.0,"I was in a clinic for 3 months when i was 13. I went for one who was specialized for children and teenagers and i agree with you. I does help if you let yourself get therapized if the therapist is good but if those who are therr aren't good then youre fucked up cus there will be no other. I was at a open station in an open clinic. We were allowed to go outside 30min a day but we were only allowed to be 500m away from the clinic. It depended on ur mental stability if you were allowed to go to the city for 2hrs two times a week.

This never bothered me bc i never gi outside but what bothered me was that i wasnt allowed tk visit my home for like 1 month. And i was there with people who had schizophrenia and bpd and they didnt get the diagnosis just bc they werent 18. They put a schizophrenic person who had Psychosis every night together in a room with someone with an anxiety disorder.... I mean thats just very horrible.

In the station Under our station had so many patients that some got kicked out just bc there werent enaugh beds and thats whs i really want that there will be more psychatries.

The ppl who would watch out for you were smtimes nice and some of them just were horrible and i dont get why they even worked there. I was once on the edge of having a panic attack but i tried to be calm bc i was having those panic attacks the entire day bc i was building everything up and bc i didnt trust my therapist and didnt have anyone to tell anything. It was night and i turned on the light bc i wanted to calm myself down and idky but since i arrived to the clinic i was alwaya afraid if the dark there. Then the Vigil came into my room and turned of the lamp that was next to my bed even though i told her i couldnt sleep and wanted to calm down but she just went outside the room and left me there having a panic attack.

Once the schizophrenic girl that i talked about when she was having a psychosis went outside her room to ask for help or that she just wanted to have someone by her side bc she was scared and the vigil said ""dont make such a drama out of it. Those are just hallucinations"" BITCH WTF SHE HAS SCHIZOPHRENIA SHE THINKS THAT THIS IS REAL BC OF IT ARE YOU STUPID?! Even i stayed often with the schizophrenic girl when she was hallucinating when it wasnt bed time already.

So what i hated the most was that i practical could just have stayed in my bed all the time at the weekends and do nothing all day except laying in bed and being on my mobile bc everyone was at home and sincr i wasnt allowed to go i would spend 1 1/2 day alone with caretakers.

I must say i got better but bc i manly was depressed bc of school and i just needed a break from it all but school would keep pushing me into depression so when i was in the clinic it got better with that. Like i said i didnt get therapized really bc i didnt want to and bc i really hated my therapist and my mom and ugh. It wqs horrible for me bc i was so homesick and just wanted to be in my room again and i saw how horrible my schizophrenic friend felt and i was still very lonely.

But i must say it was like a break from school and it helped me in that way and i became friends with some peoplr and one of them is now my best friend since 1 year. I never laughed so much in my entire life like i laughed there which i found surprising bc i thought everyone is sad and depressed there and in some stations it really is like this but mine was extremely funny."
