BPD,flodjee,t3_fq1nvp,1585336217.0,"I am the same way. I will eat ONE serving of dinner, or lunch, or whatever is being served. I never go back for seconds, no matter how hungry I am. I cannot deal with the thought of being called out for eating too much. So after everyone goes to bed, I end up binge eating from the fridge or pantry. Every. Single. Night."

OCD,fij2zjz,t3_f7pvne,1582433465.0,I think I like the show bc it's very relatable to me. I suffer from various body focused repetitive behaviors. I am aware I'm hurting myself but I still choose to pick my skin. Sometimes it's not a choice. Watching the therapists talk through the patient's decision making process is almost like free therapy for me

I am very familiar with what you are describing. Harmful body focused behaviors like that are from OCD. I compulsively pick my scalp until there is a bloody mess. The TLC Foundation for Body Focused Repetitive Behaviors is a GREAT resource. Please see the link.

calmhands,fgo3d64,t3_ezhx56,1580958828.0,"Hi there! This looks like OCD to me. My feet look very similar! After years of mutilating my toe nails and causing permanent damage to my toe nail beds, I finally sought help. I just completed an intensive outpatient program at my local hospital. It was very helpful, and the psychiatrist  prescribed me the right medication and dosage. I have taken antidepressants and anti anxiety meds for years however they never curbed my OCD. Although it takes six weeks to experience the full benefits of Zoloft, I already feel less urges to pick. Good luck to you!"
OCD,fgehksn,t3_exzp5z,1580699674.0,This is called trichotillomania. It's a body focused repetitive behavior (bfrb) that falls under the OCD spectrum.

My program isn't OCD specific, but they teach CBT and DBT. I don't know the first thing about ERP... not sure why I've never heard of it before joining this subreddit?"
OCD,fdrdepf,t3_emum4l,1578682959.0,"Hi! Welcome to OCD. I've been through a myriad of antidepressants over the last few years... and with my new psychiatrist I'm now ramping up towards a very high dose of Zoloft. (Apparently, some OCD will not respond to normal amounts of medication?) I am very hopeful! Good luck to you. 

I'm currently taking 175mg of Zoloft with a strict medication schedule for increasing that... I'm in an intensive outpatient program 5 days a week so I'm being monitored. I tried to do things my way for the last 7 or 8 years and that was not working lol"
