PublicFreakout,fjr3ite,t3_feezub,1583581022.0,There is something legitimately wrong with this girl... she seems very emotionally labile and likely manic and someone decided to put her on TV like that.  None of that was normal behavior or even entitled behavior. That was uncomfortable to watch.

I just played it in the 90s.  Game was 2d, in a multi-level building, not turn based. I think the character had red hair.  I feel it is more likely an NES game since I played that alot more."

AmItheAsshole,eylzaj5,t3_cxf4fa,1567195606.0,"NTA.  I have awful ADD and since I work nights I usually forget about traffic during the day... so I'm usually 15-30 minutes late to things.  Everyone in my life knows this and all of them lie about the start time so I can get there on time.  I appreciate it to be honest.  It's not that I don't want to be there and I actually hate being late, I'm just a mess lol."

AskReddit,ew0kdql,t3_cm1z3z,1564993243.0,If I think a baby is ugly I tell them that the baby looks just like them.  Then I don't have to say the baby is cute and they are happy cause everyone wants their baby to look just like them.

depression,evo0z92,t3_ck913s,1564636250.0,"Oof.  This hits home.  I usually range from a)totally fine to b)vaguely out of sorts, occasional thoughts of just jerking the wheel while driving, to c)crying in my bed feeling like death would just be better than how I feel.  Usually that last one is once a month or so, but I can wake up the following day feeling fine.  And nothing seems to trigger those days.... they just happen.  I don't think I'd ever follow through... I know how much it would destroy my parents and sister, and also I am totally chicken shit... but having to feel that way once a month or so for as long as I can remember in my 30 years of life is awful."

AskWomen,ev7a9jt,t3_cijryo,1564257200.0,"I had an epiphany one late night that I was going to be stuck forever in the state I grew up in if I didn't let go of my anxiety and just travel like I wanted to.  And so I forced myself to travel by signing a temp job contract across the country, not re-signing my lease, and quitting my stable job, and then I had to follow through with my plans.... and honestly best thing I've ever done for myself.  Baby step though.... go to the movies alone.... go to lunch at a real restaurant alone.... sign up for something you've always wanted to do.  You'll get more comfortable with your own company and be better for it.  When in doubt I always have a book with me!"
unpopularopinion,ev6p995,t1_eus2iv1,1564249753.0,"Not going to lie... I saw the title, thought I knew what my opinion was given my personal experience, but read this comment, and immediately changed my mind.  I can't imagine having to live my life as an accused rapist if I wasn't one.  As a rape victim it's an internal struggle at times... but it's a personal struggle that no one knows about and I can keep to myself... and it is something that has gotten much easier to deal with over time.  Being an accused rapist... that's public... that follows you forever.  How do you get over something when you can be constantly reminded of it filling out an employment form? Or moving to a new neighborhood? 
But really people just need to not falsely accuse people of rape.  That's seriously messed up."
AskReddit,ev6lsk9,t1_ev4b12w,1564248343.0,Is it cumulative? Or does it reset every time you poop?
AskReddit,ev6l4we,t1_ev3zta3,1564248089.0,Can't imagine having this power while sleeping... imagine dreams in real time... would knowing what time it is in the real world suddenly make all dreams lucid?  Would be a very interesting side effect.
