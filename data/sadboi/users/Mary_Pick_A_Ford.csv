You’ve painted the whole city like you’re some old man reminiscing about some fantasyland full of cotton candy, barbershop music, and zero crime. I’m pretty sure you aren’t more than 4 years older than me and I certainly don’t have some old memories of “innocent” times in Fullerton. There’s always been a homeless community just as there are homeless populations all over Orange County and Los Angeles. I went to every protest and march during the Kelly Thomas case and while there’s certainly bums that are just plain cruddy, I’ve met some amazing human beings that are also homeless. I’m so sick of you and every resident on NextDoor complaining about the same crap and going...”when are the police going to get the homeless?” “OMG there’s a drug rehab/group/addiction center nearby, how dare they exist!!” “Why are there so many Korean businesses here? Gee, that’s sure weird how multicultural it is now compared to when it was mostly white.......but I’m not a racist no sir, I am friends with a black guy” I could go on and on about the ridiculous complaints. So I’m glad instead of just complaining, you just left. I think that’s what these other people should have done 15 years ago. I find if you’re not happy, go somewhere that makes you happy. Life is too short to sit around and complain about how poor Fullerton is getting to be like sooo ghetto and undesirable for the privileged set.

Even men's soccer wasn't really as popular then as it is now and the US hosted the 1994 World Cup.

In the end, you guys hope that men are always on top of the money just like it’s been for thousands of years because a woman making more money than a man is considered unnatural and a threat to your delicate tinkle wand. Well someday, we will win this battle, maybe not this year, but perhaps this paves the way for positive change for women athletes to finally earn a lot of money and not minimal wage or whatever they get professionally. Someday they get the same amenities and training facilities as the men and someday they won’t have to play on fake grass. For those who want this too, the 2 or 3 on here, good on you and I would personally commend a rare breed of male that actually cares. It’s hard to believe in women when it’s so systematically patriarchal regarding our society at large. Once you’re raised in that system, it’s hard to go against the grain and believe in progress for the other sex. Why would you? If you trained by media, books, magazines and family members to believe that men must remain the more powerful sex. Those that disagree with me, I invite you to imagine if you were someone like Jessica McDonald who isn’t top tier female soccer player but in a limbo of not making enough money to support herself, should she go to the high schools and tell little girls, don’t follow your dreams to become a professional athlete because only men are good enough to earn money?
