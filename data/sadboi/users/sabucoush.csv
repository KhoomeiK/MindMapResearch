AskReddit,fqmain4,t1_fqkzl3c,1589474248.0,"Well I have a similar experience. In October 2019 I went with friends to dive. It was my first time and I was a bit scared but thought maybe I can do it. Turns out it's harder than thought. I dressed up all the tools and the first challenge was the way I enter the water backflip. Then, the panic started when I was being taught the diving sign language while I am in the water. I just figured out that there is no way of communication other than using the hand signs and I need to fully trust my instructor who happened to be a dear friend of mine. My mask was too big. I couldn't see clearly because there were bubbles all over me. I was obviously not ready for it and I started to panic. Then, the hardest part of all? The real nightmare and the near death experience was when he started to add weight to my suit to be able to drop down. My anxiety topped and I unconsciously opened my mouth and water started to fill in. He quickly got me up and talked me through and tried again. I was just shut down. So I thought to give up. Anyhow, later, another instructor whom I never met before invited me to try again. I thought maybe it would be different. Anyhow, I paid for this trip, there should be no harm. 

&#x200B;

The other instructor was so determined to get me the experience that I hated him so much. I felt pressured. He forced me down. He wouldn't help. I cried out loud for help. It was just God's absolute mercy that the captain didn't want to dive that day and he heard me  and asked him to bring me back to the boat. I was praying anxiously in the middle of the water imagining how I would die because of such experience. Just because that instructor wanted me ""to enjoy this experience."" Eventually, the captain and another guy on the boat heard me. They asked him to bring me back and take off the weights he put on me. He was angry I could tell because his plan failed and I rejected him. Obviously it was about trust and I didn't trust him enough to go through it. He eventually tried to talk me through another activity of snorkeling which I did since it was easier but I was too tired and turned off for the day. 

&#x200B;

The experience was real. I saw death was close. I was yelling out loud. I felt something is pulling me down. I couldn't move much because of the weight on me. I struggled to keep my head up so I could breath and call for help. It was a nightmare. and I would never do it again."

RelationshipAdviceNow,fqjvtqj,t1_fqjul0s,1589415938.0,"Thats how you see it? We were already friends and I want more. She wouldn't give and I wouldn't settle for the ""friendzone"" there is nothing to be thankful for. It's not about sleeping with her. It's about emotions and feelings. I asked for space and no contact at least until I heal or better it's over, because its an unfair relationship where she would always have the upper hand since I do things out of love and my emotions are on the line. Do you think you can be just a ""friend"" with someone you deep down know you have feelings for? Really? can you see her crying over someone else while you cannot help her nor yourself. Really? what a doormat. It's unfair. She doesn't get the upper hand nor can she play the strings of my heart by keeping me around for her entertainment giving me the title she likes, knowing that this is not ""platonic"" genuine relationship where one person is literally doing everything out of love not just friendship.

Even better see you falling for someone else? really? Is it about feelings or ego? Its obviously people who reject others cannot stand to be rejected. If my crush is selfish enough to have a relationship based on her own terms as she wants. Friendship and it's not even fair because feelings will always be there and we both know it. Can you really eliminate that part? It's not even the sex thing. I am talking about emotions. Pure attraction and love.

actuallesbians,fq224jp,t1_fq1qilg,1589052150.0,"Hello,

&#x200B;

Thank you for the interest in my history. Yes, being bisexual was quiet tough back in my teenage years and the fact that I had little success with any relationship made anxious about it all. 

I am not sure if she is the person that I will call ""forever."" And perhaps you are right, I am pushing for a relationship with someone to fulfill a desire. I listened to my heart that I liked her and I wanted something more than a friendship with her. I tried to leave her alone and she will come back text and call me. I feel that she doesn't want me to be upset with her but at the same time she wont give what I really want. For example, few days ago I suggested we go shopping together. She agreed to do it  during the weekend. Well, I asked her yesterday while I picked her up from her walk - back home, and she said that she will be busy working (which is true.) I was disappointed to be honest. Later, she started telling me that she needs to shop for the winter and what kind of things she has to buy. Anyhow, I was turned off by the time and I went straight to my room. She then called me to come have dinner with her.   I rejected because I had already eaten earlier but she insisted I go and sit with her. I met another friend and we started talking. She got angry that she asked me to come sit with her and I had started talking to someone else. I was a bit confused. Specially that we were in public. I apologized but she was upset. Then I went to her room to sit with her. Well, and the rest is what I had described above."
actuallesbians,fq1zez4,t1_fq1vxig,1589051438.0,"Hello again and thank you for the constructive feedback. Perhaps you are right. I am in denial and I know what is the right thing to do. The harsh truth is that, we live together and it will take so much energy of me to ignore her. Anyhow, I am seriously considering distracting myself and stepping away from this cycle. For the sake of my mental health. I am spending more time with my friends or in my room to avoid interactions with her. My plan is as follows: minimize conversation with her as much as possible. And any request she asks will be rejected just to be fair. Although to be honest, I am hoping that will make her appreciate me more if I stepped back and not been available to her all the time. Well, it's time to focus on other things anyway. I had invested this relationship so much hoping it will develop well. I don't want to be unfair to her either. She had done few good things but that's not enough I refuse to be  the friendzone. 

Thank you."

I put them on a pedestal that they looked down upon me and eventually they thought "" who would want to be with someone less than them?"" I learned it the hard and painful way. Now, I now it so well that I am trying to minimize repeating the same mistakes again. I do want to lose her the same way I lost them so I have to be tougher. For her and myself. I think thats the wisest thing to do. As much as I tried to ""control"" the outcome, I will never be able to master every bit of it. After all, she has her free and I wont be forcing myself on her. I love and respect her to do what she feels like. I will only be nice and gentle with her because I don't want to push her away. She is too sweet to be hurt.."

Who would want to be with someone less than them? It's true. I needed to figure this out the hard way. 

&#x200B;

I couldn't sleep for nights. I cried so hard and questioned everything even my own self worth after my ex who left in the most brutal way. It still hurts a bit. I still miss her and want to connect as friends only because I respect the past between us but she seem busy and I don't want to force now. I am away and I wish her the best.

I think she knows that I feel a bit uncomfortable listening to her talking about her lovers and she knows that I like her too so it's double painful. Anyhow, with time you might just no longer  care. Something are better off left unknown. Sometimes ""knowledge"" brings so much pain , specially when you have a creative brain where it starts making scenarios and imagining painful things and try to act on it. But it's out of your control now that it's even more painful since you are suffering reality + imagination + you cannot do anything about it. I would only advise, better not get deep into information. Don't ask. You better off not know. This is the hard truth from my experience. I hope yours wont be as bad. Good luck"
