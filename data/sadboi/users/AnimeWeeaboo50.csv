I had this one cat I got when I was four, she was a rescue and I loved her to death when ever I cried she would jump up in my bed and start purring and rubbing up against me... she made me feel loved. But she was always sick and we tried lots of things. But then it got really bad and we ended up having to put her down. I cried for days. After that we got the tiniest kitten I've ever seen. I had to hand feed her because she couldn't even walk to her food bowls. The thing is, she looks exactly like my other cat and even acts like her, so in a way I feel like my cat came back to me even after death.
