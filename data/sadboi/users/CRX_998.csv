As for your circumcision for wind resistance, winning is in your blood. I’d say it’s medically necessary. Good luck and chew a GU every 15min for health!"

It’s not your fault, obviously, that they’re slow and feeble. I’ve been running with a tape recorder playing coughs and sneezes while I’m blasting down the trails doing 15min miles, not a person will come near me.

I worked at a crisis line for a while, and our policy was unfortunately, 1 call per person per night so we can talk to as many people as possible and try to help. NEVER would any of us say “you need a therapist”, it’s simply not our place. 

I’m sorry the person you talked to was poorly trained and hurtful. 
You may be calling their line “too much”, but your reasons for calling are still extremely valid! I hope you’re able to find the support you need."

It just seems like a lot of waste all around because you can’t reuse the jars at the dispensaries and recycling isn’t universally available in the city unfortunately.
