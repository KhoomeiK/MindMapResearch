However, you have to try and be strong, we all have relapses and i've posted my fair share crisis posts in this forum for sure. The one thing I've learnt is that this disorder feels worse, the more you fear it. The more you stress about it, the tighter it grips hold of you. I know it seems like an impossible task but you have to try and entertain your fears as little as possible. 

Trust me, there's not one line of what you wrote that I don't relate with and struggle with on a daily basis, but I know I'm in a much better place by accepting that i'm gonna be like this for a little while, but not forever.

It's normal human behaviour - we talk to ourselves in our head all the time, voicing it is just one step further, there's not a lot of difference. 

Consider the fact that when you're trying to solve a problem it helps a lot to talk to another person - even if they don't say anything, sometimes the process of talking can push you closer to a solution! That is why we talk aloud; to help us approach problems, imagine scenarios and apply our thoughts and intuitions, it's a way of rationalising and understanding ourselves better.

Sometimes I will get caught up and likewise be concerned that I've spent an hour engaged in a scenario that hasn't even happened, but its not necessarily unhealthy. I think some people are more predisposed to doing it, if they are big thinkers or a bit anxious, whereas some people don't bother themselves and take things as it comes - pros and cons to both personality types."

Thats the thing like I'm not so worried about a drug not working because its hardly the end the world, by mental health is way more important at this point, and I'm also not super worried about it stopping the SSRI working temporarily or setting me back because I would notice it happen and then I'd know not to take whatever it was anymore or it would be an occasional thing at a festival - but I was just worried that i'll take something and then it might react and fuck me up somehow like serotonin syndrome or something but everything i've researched says that its incredibly rare and doesn't really have a lot to do with SSRI's. Like a lot of stuff said MDMA + SSRI would do that, but then I found out what you said and that its a myth it will just not work coz the SSRI blocks the synapse or something.

I was only worried coz my doctor and NHS online is like 'Do not take any recreational drugs' and she even said stay away from alcohol but then everything online is completelyyy different and know someone on SSRI's who still gets smashed and takes drugs (Granted I think its stupid the amount she does because I don't think the SSRI's are being given a chance to work) but she's been absolutely fine.. so I feel like its silly for Dr's to say that as some people are inevitably not going to listen so they should explain the actual risks so people know what they have to avoid because its literally dangerous and then what is just not advisable if you get me?

Thanks again mate."

SSRIs,fo0i0i5,t1_fmrfy2p,1587413497.0,"Hey thanks so much for your reply, I found lots of it actually really reassuring. 

Particularly that last bit! I think I was really worried that once I start them i'll never be able to come off them unless I want to be plunged into the worst of everything, but thinking of them as a way of stabilising myself after a really nasty period is so reassuring and that maybe that all I'll need is to use them to sort myself out. I think I'm gonna start tonight... I think your right about them being normal, its only when I overthink that I start to believe they're gonna be some sort of mind-altering drug or I just start to hate that just to be normal I'm gonna have to be taking a pill but I guess its no different than medicine for something physical. 

I know you're right about the drink/drugs, I haven't touched anything for a month just to try and see if it was contributing but it doesn't seem to have been because everything is largely the same, but yeah I get you that it definitely won't make things any better. If I start taking the SSRI's, then I 100% won't be drinking at all for another three weeks or more (I'm going totally dry during lockdown coz I don't see any point in drinking) so that will give it time to work on its own. But thing is, I definitely will be going out drinking with my mates after that - i'll be cautious first time and take it easy coz i'll be worried, but you don't think that getting drunk is gonna like fuck me up with the SRRI's in my system do you? or like make me have some crazy mood swing? I'm 20 and at uni so not to sound like a dick but it would be a really huge change to my life if I had to stop drinking with my mates not because I'm relying on the substance (otherwise I wouldn't of been able to stop so easy) even though i'm sure it provides relief to a degree, but the social side of it and if I did my friends would noice somethings up as well and I'd hate that...

Thanks again for your reply."
SSRIs,fo0gh3l,t1_fn532jt,1587412698.0,"Thanks so much for your reply, sounds like you went though a really similar situation, I'm glad your feeling a lot better.

I think I might have to go for it to be honest, its difficult though because for some reason I'll go 3/4 days feeling *almost* perfect and its like there's nothing wrong with me and I then genuinely convince myself that I'm a) gonna be good from then on and weirdly b) that I was never actually bad and I was overthinking it all. But its relentless it will take a few days and it hits again and I'm trying to come to terms with the fact its likely gonna stay like this as its been months.

I think taking on bored what you've said, its quite reassuring and I might go for it *tonight*. Because I'm starting to look back at the last month and its obvious that despite the fact I keep having periods of clarity, I dont think it means im actually progressing anywhere... I might even be getting worse because I'm starting to feel really irritable most of the time even when I'm in good periods and I cant help but act moody with my parents (I'm 20 so this isn't normal) I have no reason to be annoyed at them but I think the frustration of my situation is just manifesting that way and i'll have these 5 second moments when I come out the other end of a distraction and I remember all my problems and I just feel like dropping to the floor and giving up or throwing something (I obviously don't) but these very short feelings of hopelessness are new as well and it just seems like the SSRI's might help with that as well...

It's all so ridiculous because I'm a 20 year old bloke and whilst i've had anxiety issues for a long time they've never gotten in the way of things like I've been able to crack on and be generally a very happy person. But now i'm finding that 80% of my day and thoughts are plagued with constant worry about my condition whether i'm gonna get worse, whether i'll be the same again etc etc and so I think you're right the SSRI's are worth a shot. I just worry about it making me worse and sending me off on panic attacks but I get thats an unrealistic worry and I should try options. I've even spent the last month drinking no alcohol/drugs, exercise every day and cracking on with uni work hoping that maybe that would fix me but I really don't think i've seen any obvious improvement, its the same 4 days on 4 days off sort of pattern with almost constant random snippets of derealisation and compulsive thoughts about my identity.

I think you're right and I should try it. I got a couple questions if you don't mind?

How were you diagnosed? it sounds silly but all my doctor was spend 5 mins and then just agreed with my that 'it sounds like excessive anxiety' prescribed SSRI's and that was it... It sounds silly but I really feel like I need to know more? From personal research and stuff it sounds like I have GAD/Panic Disorder/some kind of OCD tendencies/derealisation symptoms but I don't know which one or maybe a combination of them and I just feel like unless I have somebody evaluate and officially diagnose me I constantly doubt that anything is really wrong with me, I don't my self diagnosis basically. I just feel like I need to hear it officially, otherwise I just dismiss it and also I feel like it will make it easier for me to open up to some of my friends about it - at the moment i'd feel silly telling them I'm just anxious coz its so much worse than that and equally  I'd feel like i'll freak them out if I explain my symptoms so it would be really helpful if I ever felt like I needed or was in a bit of crisis I could be like 'hey so I've got 'xyz' bare with me' sort of thing. 

Secondly, I know your not a doctor, but so my doctor prescribed me the SSRI's and there are 30 of them... how will I go about getting a second prescription, will I justly be able to call up and say, yep they're working I want to carry on but I'm running out can you repeat the prescription? and then pop in any pharmacy. *I only ask because I was prescribed at my uni doctors in Brighton but because of the pandemic I now live over an hour away so wondering if now that I've been prescribed them once that I don't physically have to go in and ask for them again and I'm scared they'll run out on me and ill have to deal with the consequences of stopping suddenly*

Lastly, there's no chance that taking an SSRI will just fuck me up some how is there..? I swear all it is is just serotonin? 

Sorry to ask so much of you!"

Depersonalization,fnw7rj8,t1_fnthyx1,1587313124.0,"No worries bud, your post helped and served as confirmation for me as well.

I think you're right when you describe it as a way of thinking, its almost like a tunnel that I have to try and avoid going down, something will trigger then I could spend an hour agonising a bunch of things that I don't feel familiar with anymore. Reminding yourself that it's simply just a 'way of thinking' as opposed to successive legitimate and meaningful revelations might be key.

It's almost like a lens that you're looking through; I don't believe there is actually anything fundamentally different about myself/ yourself, or whatever the subject of obsession is, its simply because derealisation is imposing those strong, vivid feelings on you and making you look through a distorted lens. When your becoming obsessive its crucial to distract yourself and try and remind yourself that you haven't actually changed and even if *you* feel like you're not you and cannot identify yourself, chances are everybody around you nevertheless has very strong idea of what you are, take comfort in that. That has not changed. They likely view you exactly as the always have - and the only reason this might change is if you allow your DPDR to alter your behaviour - which is why you should always carry on as you normally would and distract yourself and try not to ruminate.

Personally I think for me it might be because for a long time I've spend a lot of time wondering what people think of me (which cannot be controlled) and so I spend a lot of time trying to ensure a good image. I suppose the longer you spend projecting an  image/wearing a mask, on autopilot, the easier it is to stop and suddenly forget who you really are, because your not taking time to slow down and reflect on yourself etc. Its also why looking at pictures of myself  a year or even a few months ago can be a bit strange because I'm like is that really me? of course it is and I probably felt so at the time. It is just obsessive thought. At the end of the day our consciousness is what makes us, us. The completely unique way we think about things and our proclivities to feel/think/believe a certain way, that is the 'self'.

It's tough coz whilst it's happening it can make me, like you stay, feel sad and hopeless thinking about what makes me, me and that i'm not the same or never will be. It's uncomfortable - so you're not alone.

He said '5G is dangerous because it emits high levels of radiation'.

I said 'yes but the radiation isn't dangerous' *(referring to the specific type of non-ionising radiation emitted by 5G masts, specifically what we were talking about)*

He then tried to use this against me ""OMG listen to yourself I can't believe your trying to tell me radiation isn't dangerous""

\- that was never what I said. I said 5G radiation isn't dangerous. Which he then used to suggest I thought other types of radiation such as nuclear radiation wasn't harmful. To be honest I don't think he did this intentionally. I genuinely think he's unaware what radiation actually is and so he hears the word 'radiation' being used in the context of 5G and then the fact he is aware of the popularly understood fact that nuclear radiation is harmful is used to falsely form a new belief that 5G radiation is likely to be harmful - unaware that the term *radiation* is a hypernym."
askphilosophy,fnmq8zz,t1_fml82w4,1587076098.0,"That first point is good one, I think its worth reminding him of things that he himself would consider himself to be having knowledge in he case of your examples. Similarly, a good strategy might be perhaps asking him what the time is, when he responds unsuspectingly then asking him why he gave me he answer he did when we don't *know* anything; the time on his phone could have been broken, the government could have tapped his phone in a conspiracy to change the time etc. but nonetheless he reasonably discounted all of these outlandish possibilities and responded implicitly suggesting he 'knew' the time. *He didn't say 'the time is 'probably' x' or 'the time is x if and only if all of these insane scenarios are not the case'.* That would have trapped him to demonstrate that he in fact discounts absurd beliefs implicitly all the time and that it is not ignorant to do so and he would have also accidentally exhibited a belief that in a practical sense we do have knowledge or at least we behave as if we do because knowledge has value. 

Second point is also good, because even if we committed to living in a skeptical world we still rank beliefs in order to survive etc. we still see value in good arguments because they lead us to success."
askphilosophy,fnmosyq,t1_fmnd5kn,1587075328.0,"That's actually really funny you should bring that fallacy up because the same person used it literally in the same example you gave: 5G, but I never knew the name of it until now.
He brought up how 5G radiation is hazardous for our health, I asked him why he thought this, he told me 'have you not seen the Instagram videos' luckily I happened to have done extensive research into it since its become so topical and so I was able to explain why there lacks any solid evidence  citing reputable organisations and describing the science in depth... he found himself unable to answer any questions about what radiation even is and rather than giving up he then proceeded to say ""I'm just saying we should have been asked whether we wanted 5G first it shouldn't have been done without consent""
- but thats not what he was saying in the first instance or for the most part at all; he resorted to it at the very last minute when he had nothing else to say! His second thought is much more reasonable (arguably its still strange to want to have to give consent when he cant even explain why its dangerous and elections arguably provide legitimacy and consent) but nonetheless just simply saying 'whether its dangerous of not we should have to give consent for 5G' is radically different to making baseless claims that it is detrimental to human health. The manoeuvre is still difficult to deal with because they escape scrutiny from the original point and shift the discourse almost like they're blurring whatever they said before into this new less radical argument that they're willing to publicly defend whilst simultaneously not being willing to privately give up the radical belief even though they found themselves unable to defend it. I think your right, its because they are so compelled to the belief that they want to keep it, its compelling and so it doesn't mater if somebody is able to refute it.

Thanks so much for your advice. Yeah that the thing I've just read the list of possible side effects and some of them just sound horrible, often there's side effects the are the exact things I'd take them to resolve...

Its a constant battle because part of me just wants to be normal and not have to be on any medication, I don't want to have to take it every day and be concerned about drinking or whatever, or be looking out for potential side-effects, but at the same time I get such bad days where I feel like its the only option left. It's hard to tell whether I'm making progress without them.

Also, it's worth asking, since you seem to have a lot of experience with them, have you ever taken any recreational drugs whilst on them. I won't lie its fairly common in my social group and I'm bound to go to a festival this year so its just another thing i'm taking into account; not because I *need* to take drugs but its so normalised for everyone at uni it would be another thing I'd suddenly have to watch out for. If I choose to take SSRI's I would of course try and avoid everything, but I'm just wondering if it came to it are their any red flags, that might actually cause me harm or danger. It seems from what I've found most things would either reduce the effect of the SSRI or reduce the effect of the drug. *If you'd prefer not to answer, or don't know, that's cool, it's just I've just seen so many different things online and my Dr. just said no illicit drugs and no alcohol, and it would be good to get some clarity.*"

SSRIs,fmkurn9,t3_fvmktq,1586169456.0,"Hey there,

I'm 20. I get disassociation all of the time. The world feels like a dream and nothing feels real. It's called derealisation/depersonalisation disorder *or* it results as a symptom of many other conditions including anxiety, which is likely to be the case for yourself. Your perfectly entitled to believe that it is a spiritual awakening  or other dimensions but there is a scientific explanation for what you are feeling. I understand these sorts of beliefs are compelling because the feelings your getting are so significant and strange (i have them too) but its important for you to know its very normal. Thinking in the way you often only serves to exacerbate the feelings; its kind of like a downward spiral. The more you assign meaning to the feelings and experiences, the more your brain will search for them and the more frequently they will appear. 

It's a mechanism in the brain whereby in order to shield itself from constant or severe anxiety/depression/trauma, it makes the subject feel like they aren't real and places them in an almost dream like state (sometimes very subtle and the experience can be ineffable, sometimes very extreme). Of course, in reality this often makes the subject feel even more uncomfortable and worried as the symptoms can be overwhelming and alarming. 

I find symptoms very upsetting and constantly find myself questioning what is happening and disbelieving the science in favour of more worrying beliefs that something more significant is happening to me; but it is important to not have this mindset as it will only encourage feelings- I'd advice you to explain your symptoms to a doctor or therapist if you have one.

The law of attraction, again, whilst may be an interesting way to live your life and may even result in positive outcomes and a better state of mind, just so your aware has no scientific grounding. 

One tough reality for people with derealisation problems, and one that I've only recently been tackling myself, is that you have to accept it for it to go away. You have to accept that it will be a part of your life for a little while, its not a nice thought and i'm sure you just will want to feel normal, but for this to happen you have to just keep living your life as normal as possible. You're very young at 16 by the way I know your worries about libido seem concerning to you, but don't put so much pressure on yourself, things may fall in to place.

Good luck with everything!

P.S. Weed, MDMA and other drugs are frequent triggers for anxiety and derealisation. Whilst being on them at the time isn't always an immediate trigger, the damage is often in the longer run. It isn't the case for everyone but defiantly be cautious. Hallucinogens such as LSD  however, I'm warning you are a serious no no if you have mental health problems. You will risk serious implications and may never see things the same again. Most people who take these drugs are fine, but if you have mental health problems you are not 'most people'  and are immediately are in a high risk pool. 

Also, it may seem obvious but your doctor is best placed to give you advice about the damage you feel you may have been caused by early use of SSRI's. I'm not sure of the science on this, but your doctor will be, if you feel they aren't taking your worries seriously enough, ask to see another doctor, you're allowed. 

Wish you the very best. You've got this!"
Depersonalization,fmiushs,t3_fvju7k,1586117348.0,"Relate with this so much. 

Constant existential questioning and its very intrusive, sometimes I won't really think it up myself, the thought just kind of appears in my brain. 

Also, yeah, things that I've always been so so familiar with for right reasons, I will start to question my familiarity, and then as that happens the object of thought becomes increasingly unfamiliar. 

What's particularly distressing is it can happen with loved ones, family, friends or places I feel most familiar my university campus or my room. I'll look at my mum or something and wonder *who* she actually is, and question what sort of a person she is. There's of course no reason for this whatsoever, i've known her all my life and she's amazing, but once i've considered that thought I feel like I don't know her kind of, and wonder what makes her, her. I'll even get it with words, just like how when you repeat a word so many times it looses its meaning, if I think about language too much it really freaks me out and triggers feelings of unreality. 

Then what i've been battling most recently is constant questioning of what makes me, myself. Whether there is anything that makes me, myself. Who am I? It sounds so stupid because I should know who I am and I do, but simultaneously feel I don't. I've been told something to help with this, is whenever you can try and get other people to describe you and what makes you different, or key features about your personality. 

It seems to be a symptom of existential OCD/anxiety, as these are questions which don't seem to bother most people and never used to me, but since my derealisation developed, its very triggering, compulsive and makes me feel very uncomfortable."
Depersonalization,fmisgn6,t1_fmh4ht8,1586115997.0,"Just to say, I think this is some of the best advice I've read yet!

I'm still struggling, but you truly have to accept it. Try not to ruminate over it, if you wake up and can tell its going to be a bad day, do *not* let that stop you! I know its the last thing you want to do but just crack on with your day, keep your self busy and try and socialise with people. Focus on what's happening around you rather than how you feel. 

When I was at my worst I felt exactly the same, got myself really upset and distressed thinking about how i'll never be me again, but it's that sort of thinking that encourages it. It's a downward spiral. 

I just wish **so** badly that it wasn't such an unknown condition, baring in mind how common it can crop up for anxiety conditions, which are so common. If people were more aware of it and there was a more open discussion, then it was remove so much unnecessary distress and fear."

Gassed to hear that you've come out the other side of your degree...its legit the worst circumstances to find yourself struggling with something like this with all the debt and pressure to succeed and simultaneously one of the best times of our lives and so there's that huge worry that this is going to be a cloud that hangs over it - but I guess gotta take the shit that life throws at us. Definitely gonna look into CBT, sounds like a challenging process but i've heard good things."
Anxiety,fhj7mp0,t3_f3fehc,1581639607.0,"100% relate. One of the most reliable cures to a panic attack or anxiety is to go out and see people and socialise, it's a no.1 distraction along with exercise. 

Maybe your right about it being in our biology who knows, but yeah I totally agree - what's  difficult though is that when i'm anxious the last thing I *want* to do is socialise...but I know if I force myself it can help make the anxiety subside."

mentalhealth,fhj6320,t3_f3df6i,1581638789.0,"I get intrusive thoughts as well mate.

They're pretty alarming eh, its like thinking of something but completely unrequested, a thought that can be irrational, confusing, scary and the last thing you want in your head; but it's there and you feel like you didn't actually 'think' it up yourself. 

I've heard it's about allowing them to come and go without assigning meaning to them, I haven't quite figured this out yet... They still scare me to shit and often i'll spiral and this just welcomes more."
PanicAttack,fhj5lck,t3_f3ighq,1581638542.0,"Hey man, i've had them almost lasting full days, nasty shit eh. 

Best advice, if you haven't already, tell the school! They need to know this sort of stuff so they can help you in any way possible. That means if you need to excuse yourself for whatever reason, then you'll be able to, there's no point you suffering for hours in silence, especially if you're at school, you won't be focussing whatsoever. 

If your nervous/embarrassed to do that, speak to your parents and they will inform your school; and if you haven't told your parents yet - do it NOW. It's so so important, to have at least one person who knows what your going through, you'd be surprised how incredibly understanding people are and how much it can help."
Depersonalization,fhj4683,t1_fhikvax,1581637852.0,"What makes an SNDRI different to an SSRI then? How would I decide what is best for me? Sorting therapy, don't think it's going to be a particularly easy experience though - for some reason I cant help but doubt it will work and its hard to defeat that attitude. 

Glad to hear that it's helping you, we're all in this shit together eh. Thanks for your reply."
Anxiety,fhj3owe,t1_fhhzksy,1581637617.0,"You're right about exercise, I've been going on runs because i've figured out its very hard to feel anxious when your running as your body is busy focusing on other things.

You're right about spending more time with friends and family, in fact thats one of the only ways I can diminish and attack, it's the best distraction but it's nonetheless uncomfortable. 

Thanks for your reply mate."

Depersonalization,fhj2wmn,t1_fhhem2r,1581637124.0,"It's supposed to be 'the' medication to look towards if you were suffering with DPDR prior, but I guess it affects people in different ways, but I reckon that withdrawal might be particularly harsh on me if I were to begin and then stop, and maybe your right to be wary as its not a nice thought that I may have to stay on them forever..

Thanks for your response mate."
Depersonalization,fhj2ok1,t1_fhihvpa,1581636983.0,"Wow, that's really helpful stuff thank you! especially as I can go in equip with constructive suggestions of what might be useful. Didn't even know I could request a psychiatrist and I'd never heard of a gene site test. Also really helpful to hear from an actual person who's experienced exactly what i'm going through and knows first hand the ways it can make you feel; really handy to know about what you said about feeling rough if you miss meds, thats not a very nice thought feeling as if your almost dependant on a drug to be happy especially as i'm not necessarily depressed in and of itself, but frankly if it has even a chance of easing DPDR and anxious thoughts etc, then its definitely worth trying and maybe i'll suggest that combination you mentioned earlier. 

Yeah so like the thoughts just sometimes appear in my mind unrequested, so its like i've thought something without really thinking and then I spiral because I freak out that its happening and I feel out of control..

That doesn't sound nice at all but it sounds like your making/have made a lot of progress and hopefully one day you will be able to return eh. Luckily I don't seem to get memory issues too bad but it does impact concentration and focus really quite bad, its just this is all about a month old at the moment so i'm just hoping its something I can cope with and won't be sure for a while, especially if I just get work done during periods of clarity and distract myself when I'm feeling rough - speaking to my university tomorrow as well and i'm just gonna explain everything and then when I have low attendance they won't be on my back I guess...

One last thing, have you had problems drinking alcohol on any of these meds (thats if you do drink) I know its not the best thing for people with anxiety anyway especially with hangovers, but my current lifestyle at uni means that its kind of hard to avoid and I'd probs massively go in myself if I couldn't join in with what i'm used to doing, going out and stuff. 

Thank-you so much for all of that, feel like I can be a lot more proactive when I speak to my doctor tomorrow, feel like I know what i'm on about a lot more!"
Depersonalization,fhi1mrf,t1_fhhg6qj,1581616037.0,"Hey, thanks for your reply and insight! 

Okay well that sounds positive to be honest. Going to see my GP tomorrow and sorting psychotherapy...I worry though that a doctor won't understand the symptoms I'm getting; I've seen posts with people saying that their GP's didn't fully get what they were saying but i'll just try to explain anyway, because I wouldn't want the wrong meds or anything too strong or something that's gonna make me worse, but simultaneously i'm getting desperate and quite badly depressed and I know I'm just gonna spiral. Last time I saw a nurse and she suggested SSRI's but I kind of hesitated as hearing them described as 'anti-depressants' made me think she hadn't really understood me properly. However, after researching they sound like they could be a bit of a solution.

I'm so sorry to hear you had to drop out of uni. I don't see point in dropping out as I don't think its the cause of my anxiety and so I'd just be at home with the same problems and it having that sort of impact on my life I feel would freak me out more.

Have you experienced any side-effects of the meds? I just need some relief to be honest as its fairly relentless...hard to focus on something but equally hard to relax."

Depersonalization,fg40cx7,t3_etr4vm,1580493500.0,"Your advice has just helped my come out of 5 days of DP..even reading a positive story in an of itself allowed me to believe it would come to an end. 

Now I'm sure its gonna come back, and it could even be soon, but it's nice to have my head above the water for a while.

The most helpful thing was to try and ignore it- almost accept it in a way because that way its no longer worrying and eventually went. 

Thanks for sharing your story!"
Depersonalization,fg3zorn,t3_ewlu64,1580493096.0,"I have just come out of the other end of 5 days of disassociation. 

Was not weed induced for me, but have had it induced from weed before. You have to try and relax as much as you can and stop focusing on it and it is that which allows it to go away - now I'm not saying this is easy, it is not, it took 5 days for me recently! but try to focus on distractions even though you probably don't feel like you even want to distract yourself. 

The moments of clarity will get longer and longer, but it will likely be a constant process of going in and out until eventually your head will remain above the water. 

Don't get too over-excited when you have moments of clarity, try to be indifferent towards them. You must try to be us unbothered about how you feel either way. If you are too excited about a moment of clarity your mind will begin to worry and watch out for when it will end.

Try not to be too scared, what you're experiencing is recognised, normal and you will get through it eventually soldier."

PanicAttack,fg0bwd3,t3_evt657,1580404543.0,"Yes. Almost every time I have one, I feel like i'm going to go crazy/have gone crazy.

Its a horrible feeling but its recognised as quite a common symptom. I get it coupled with derealisation as well where the world doesn't feel real - this as you can imagine makes me feel even 'crazier'."
mentalhealth,ffxf81i,t3_eubiqt,1580323935.0,"Mate, 100% talk to a therapist, this is exactly what they are here for. 

You're right that it never seems the right time to do something, but the answer to that is not to *never* do something, but to do it *now*! because why not? There will always feel like a reason to put it off, so tackle it now.

I've only just found this reddit coz I seem to have similar derealisation symptoms to you, and i'm just coming to terms with them and they are freaking me out, but doctors have already prescribed me something to help with anxiety, which I believe is the cause (at least for me anyway) and there's plenty more steps to take, and despite the fact that I don't want to, am scared to, and am in the middle of my second year at university, I know I **have** too because it will only get worse. 

Understanding that derealisation as you might have already found out is often, but not always, a result of a mental health condition, not a problem in and of its self and so would likely disappear along with your depression if you seek help. 

One thing that might lift your spirits is if you muster up the courage to speak *openly* with a doctor they may prescribe you SSRI's, which are basically anti-depressants. These are proven to **significantly** ease depression and i'm yet to try them but have read elsewhere on reddit that they are one of the only things that have helped with derealisation, other than therapy and distracting yourself. 

I completely understand your situation with conspiracy theories, my problem I think is exacerbated by philosophy and existential thoughts - I will not be able to get them out of my mind and even though I might know they're ridiculous, my mind can obsess and then it can bring on derealisation. - Try to lay off them, I understand you will obsess over thoughts you already have, but don't go trying to find new things to research if you can help it. This is merely just obsessive compulsive tendencies which again is normal and recognised. Your 'simulation theory' if i'm guessing right is no different to the philosophical skeptic argument that we may all be in a 'dream' or 'simulation' its a very interesting argument but most people just shrug it off because it doesn't matter, but you find this difficult because of the derealisation you are suffering - it basically gives you evidence to believe and be attracted to the theory - it makes it *matter* to you because it seems real. This is the same with me but you must remember that it is your condition causing you to feel so compelled towards it. 

The most important thing is just to explain everything - it may seem difficult to you now but the second you begin to talk, everything will start to flow out, and it will feel really good. What you have is **recognised** and its not just you imagining it, it is a **real sensation** that you feel and can be prevented.

You are **you,** you are **sane** and things will get better because people are all around you who will help - but push for it; make it clear you need help, and keep motivation by remembering the times where you have felt most distressed and how you want to avoid that feeling."
