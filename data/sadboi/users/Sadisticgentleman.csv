depression,ew7ws4p,t3_cn4s45,1565198769.0,I've snapped a few times in front of the wife and I've had a few mental breakdowns at work before. I can vouch at least on my end it doesnt really seem to change anyone's perspective on it as they all still brush it off as oh you're just angry or you're just overexxagerating. Its exhausting. I try to hide mine the best I can and then I just let it all go at night when everyone's asleep and I'm alone.

No matter what i do I'm always sad/emotionless, I feel trapped by everything and everyone that sometimes at night when I'm by myself I go so deep I become delusional and talk to myself. No one around me seems to really truly understand."
