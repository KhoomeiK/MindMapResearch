There are a few things you can do to help for these situations in the future.  I have been working on getting these sort of things drawn up.  Last time I was committed, my (now ex)husband had made threats of LEAVING me in the institute.  They wont listen to you when you are suicidal.  My doctor in the institute wouldn't even give me my insulin in proper doses.

Taken straight from the depression and bipolar support alliance website:

How can I be prepared for a crisis in the future?

Make a crisis planning list. Briefly describe the kind of help you would like to receive if you have severe symptoms again. Include:

Your doctor‚Äôs name and contact information

Contact information of your support group and other trusted friends/family members

Other health problems and medications you take

Allergies and medications you cannot take

Your insurance or Medicaid information and the hospital where you prefer to be treated

Things that might trigger an episode, such as life events, travel, physical illness or work stress

Warning signs such as talking very fast, paranoia, lack of sleep, slowed down movement, excessive alcohol or drug use

Things people can say that will help calm or reassure you

Things people should do for you such as take away your car keys and lock up anything you could use to hurt yourself

Things emergency staff can do for you, such as explain things, talk slowly, give you space, or write things down for you

Reasons your life is worthwhile and your recovery is important

How can an advance directive or a medical power of attorney help me?

An advance directive and a medical power of attorney are written documents in which you give another person authority to make treatment decisions for you if you are too ill to make your own. It is best to consult a qualified attorney to help you put together an advance directive or medical power of attorney. These documents work differently in different states."
