Otherwise you'll either spend the rest of your day with a ""hangover"" or you won't be able to go to sleep that night.

In high school I used to be home all day by myself during the summer because both parents worked. Late one morning, around 10 or 11am, I decided to take a bubble bath. About 10 minutes in I hear the front door open. We never locked our doors during the day because 1. Someone was usually home and 2. It's a really tight knit neighborhood so it felt safe as can be. I thought it was one of my parents so I shouted that I was in the tub. Nothing. No response. The cupboards start banging in the kitchen. I'm thinking ""this is how I die. Naked in the bathroom."" so I scramble for a towel. Then footsteps run up the stairs toward me and past to my parents bedroom where more cupboards start banging. I shout a warning and the footsteps run away from me. 

I finally mustered up the courage (in my towel) to open the bathroom door and go check it out. Nothing was missing. Nothing was messed up. I never saw anyone. 

Best my parents and I could guess when I told them is that my neighbor's mentally handicapped grandson had come in the house and then ran away when I shouted."

Your boyfriend is an abusive man, and you need to get out now. He will try to make you believe that you won't find anyone else - you're young and you will. He will try to make you believe that it's your fault he acts this way - it's NOT, it's his. He will try to make you believe that things can be good again - it's a lie to keep you trapped and to gas light you. 

Make a plan. Document EVERYTHING in case you need to go to the police. Either go live with your parents or a friend or go to a women's shelter. Grab your essentials during the day while he's not home and LEAVE. Block him. Get a restraining order if you need to, just erase him from your life. You deserve so much more than to believe the things this man is telling you. You can find someone that gives you all 👆 f the good times with none of the bad - not like this. No one deserves to be bullied, abused, or twisted emotionally. Don't let him make you believe otherwise.

THIS CAN'T BE ABOUT CALLING HER FAT. 

Honestly, she is hating you for it now, but teaching her how essential physical activity is to overall health NOW will only help her in the future. I say get her input on what she thinks is fair - don't let her cop out though. If she says she doesn't want to do it alone, do it with her. If she says she doesn't like anything, try something new every day. This is CRUCIAL. 

But even more importantly, talk to her about her diet. Explain that sweets are ok, but in moderation. Don't deny her the Little Debbies - that could just lead to bingeing and hiding it. Set a limit. Maybe one after dinner. Help her learn moderation, not restriction. Maybe see if you can get her interested in helping with dinner? These will help her learn critical skills for college and life after when it gets even more difficult to apply that self control. Help her learn it here. 

Sit down with your wife and calmly explain WHY you are worried (and it's not because your daughter is chubby!). Explain that her sedentary lifestyle can lead to heart disease, joint problems, asthma, depression, etc. Explain that you want your daughter to be fit - not skinny - because you want her to live a long life free of the complications that come from being overweight. 

I was skinny and active in high school, but i didn't learn how to control my eating in a healthy way. Now I'm obese and struggling with binge-eating disorder, arthritis, and depression. I wish someone had taught me healthy eating habits when I was a teen."
