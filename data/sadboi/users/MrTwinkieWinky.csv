EscapefromTarkov,ffdv7cx,t1_ff2w76y,1579829746.0,"Most of this fits a rat, however a main trait of rats is not to run from fights in general, only run if the shots are directed at you, most high tier rats wait until the firefight is done or sneak to it and shoot the winner in the back or head and take the loot. Another is hide in dark/ratlike corners and shoot people when they come in. I have also seen one rat drop items in spots that are vulnerable so when players go to get it he hits them with the rat attack."
