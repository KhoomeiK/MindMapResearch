I cannot even begin to imagine the pain you‚Äôre suffering right now. I am so sorry. It is normal to be very sad and depressed because of this, of course. That was the love of your life.

She sounds like she was absolutely amazing. A good hearted soul who would do anything for you and for others happiness. I am deeply sorry to hear this is your life. Wow. It‚Äôs such a shame to hear about this.

As the saying goes ‚Äúthis too shall pass‚Äù this is true. 
Only time can heal your wounds. However, this is something so tragic, you will always have the scar. Horrible things happen to people. Sad, but true. If only this was not the case.

I don‚Äôt want to make you more sad, but this is the truth. It‚Äôs going to hurt for a bit longer. Maybe it will hurt a little forever. But, she seems like the person who wouldn‚Äôt want you to be sad forever, of course. You explain how wonderful, kind, and caring she is. 

You miss her deeply, as many do I‚Äôm sure. It‚Äôs okay. Let yourself be sad and cry cry cry. Feels better after you cry, thankfully.

You will be okay, this I can promise. You will be okay. Life will go on and you will get through it. It is not your fault at all. This could have happened to anybody. Do not blame yourself. Everyone ALWAYS finds a way to blame themselves for things like this. Survivors guilt. Realize, this is not true. It‚Äôs not your fault at all. Life took its course, the cards of life were dealt, and this is the reality of the situation. 

It cannot change. It cannot be undone, though I wish we could go back in time. 

We could stop many things from happening and be much further advanced and peaceful in society.

I hope the suspects in question are who committed the crime. I hope they are served a horrible, miserable long sentence. I pray they rot until their 80s or 90s in prison. Disgusting fu*ks. 

I pray for you, religious or not. I‚Äôm sorry. I hope all of us who responded helped you even just a little. I wish I could be in front of you talking and give you a hug and sh*t like that. Damn 6 ft rule tho! 

But real talk. TL/DR:
You‚Äôre going to be okay
Let yourself be sad for a while
Only time can help
I‚Äôm praying for you
You must be an amazing person, yourself, to have had such an amazing person be in love with you! You‚Äôre the best!

Advice,fohetdj,t3_g7a7o4,1587764750.0,"First of all, thank you for sharing. I am sorry you have a hard time right now. 

Want to kill yourself is normal thought. Hard times make people think irrational. Thank you for coming here to get advice first!

Don‚Äôt worry. You are not alone. Like me, I felt the same. Now I want to help people who are like me.

You can‚Äôt change what your dad did. He has mental health issues of his own. This is sad. It‚Äôs hard, but I would suggest not talking to him anymore. At least for a long time. Maybe 1 year or more.

70 hours a week is a long time to work. It must be very hard. You are doing a great job and working hard! That is admirable. 
That means temporary, though. You will not work that job, those hours, with those people forever. You are young! Don‚Äôt worry. 21 is great age! Tough to be 21 but good. You will learn a lot.

Just give life another 5-10 years. Sounds like a lot. I promise it‚Äôs not. It will go by, before you know it. Please appreciate life more. 

Infinity is in front of us all. Eternity. We only get so much time on earth. 0.000000000001% of time. LESS than that! After even 80 years of life.

Don‚Äôt give up. Life will change and be better. 
Things can get much worse. Maybe you get cripple, broken, unable to talk, walk, feed yourself, go to the bathroom on your own.

You are young 21 years old with a whole life ahead! If you want to pursue something, go for it! Make a lot of effort to be better at it. Study a little more to be better student! Study is very fun to learn new things! 

Be sure to work on studying what you don‚Äôt know and don‚Äôt like a little too! Be well rounded. You seem very very smart. You have a lot of troubles and are a hard worker. You want many great things! 

Anything worth having in life takes some time and effort.
This is worth it. 
If these important things were easy, you wouldn‚Äôt appreciate them as much. I promise!

Will you tell me more about what it means ‚Äúreality makes me crazy‚Äù as you said? 

I hope I helped you. Keep staying strong and smart like you are! Keep getting stronger and smarter. Don‚Äôt give up. Don‚Äôt leave us! I want you to succeed 
You‚Äôre going to be so amazing soon wow!! üëçüòÉ"

I know a bunch of dead people. Miss them. 

It‚Äôs okay to have those thoughts. I have them as well. Once upon a time I almost was dead because of it.

Changed my life.

Recently, a 19[F] we know shot herself. Felt the same way. 

Destroyed everyone.

Not worth it.

Not gonna tell you ‚Äúcheer up‚Äù and all that shit. You‚Äôve heard it all before, right?

I‚Äôll leave you with this... 

Yea, you never leave your room, but you‚Äôll never EVER leave the fuckin ground, or the state of being dead. 

Being dead is forever. The measly little 70-80 years you might live if you don‚Äôt off yourself is 0.00000000000000000000001% of eternity. Even smaller than that because it‚Äôs impossible to equate. Just for perspective though. 

Before you is the infinite past (forever) and ahead is the infinite future (also forever)

In terms of forever, what‚Äôs the big deal of just living another 60-70 years? Ain‚Äôt no thang. 

F*ck it. Might as well live until you die anyway, right? There will be ups and downs. The virus gonna stop. People to f*cking despise will cease to be in your life at one point or another, and eventually you‚Äôll find people, memes, games, words and sh*t that matter to you and make you feel something other than self loathing and depression.

I‚Äôm happy as F*CK that I‚Äôm alive now. I was exactly like you. Had a lot of stuff to think about. Thought about it, and decided things only matter to me if I say they do.

Things make me happy or sad because I let them. 

Walk around saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm depressed I wanna die‚Äù affirms that in your brain.

Hope I helped you a little... or a lot. If not, pm and tell me what else is on your mind!

Yes, it would be nice to give some more money.

I have given slightly over $1,000 for being here only.
I cook, clean, clean after his cat, the litter box, etc even persons laundry at times. Even work on persons car for them when I first came.

Advice,fodgdql,t3_g6n041,1587684353.0,"A lot of very good information on here from people already!

In a nutshell:

Eat enough protein per day. 0.8g - 1g of preordering per lbs of weight every day.

To get a more fit look, eat less carbs. Around 200g-300g of carbs a day is a decent round number. Clean though, no cookies and cakes and ice creams. 

Cardio is your friend. 
Calisthenics (like pushups, pullups, sit-ups, burpees, etc.) and running. Doing long steady cardio for 30 straight minutes a day 3-4x a week along with calisthenics. 

Avoid ‚Äúcounting calories‚Äù that‚Äôs fine. But it‚Äôs much more beneficial to count macros (protein carbs and fat)

Stick to one program and healthy eating for at least 2 months before deciding if it works or not. Results will happen fast. 60 days will go by faster than you think.

Stay motivated, eat junk occasionally, don‚Äôt be way too strict or way too lenient. 

Hope this helped you! 
If you want, PM me and I will make you a slightly more detailed diet and exercise plan!"

Ride it out and relax for a day or two.
After that day or two of relaxing, try to get back into your normal habits.

People who are depressed say no one loves or cares about them. I‚Äôve been there, this is never the case.
It is also about making an effort on your part too. 
No one ever knocks on someone‚Äôs door unknowingly and asks ‚Äúhey! Wanna be besties?‚Äù I‚Äôd grab my PDW and stand by to fight for my life, more than likely! 
Social media is a dangerous place, I haven‚Äôt used it since 18 years old and am 25 now. 
People see ‚Äú2,500 Instagram followers‚Äù or more or whatever platform. People with less look at that and feel inferior and like maybe they aren‚Äôt beautiful or some BS like that. 
If you want to be wanted, you have to make a small effort to talk to people! 

Do you play video games?
If you‚Äôre good at a game or just have interesting dialog and a microphone of sorts, people will WANT you to play with them! 
And here on reddit, good move.
See, I WANT to talk to you. I‚Äôm even interested in getting to know you more!

You don‚Äôt know me, I don‚Äôt know you. Strangers. Yet, I‚Äôm interested in your life now and want to know about you and stuff, so do tell!

Do you live alone?
Do you have ‚Äúfriends‚Äù?
What games do you play, if any?
Do you envy ‚Äúpopular people‚Äù on social media?
How old are you? 
Pancakes or waffles?
Favorite color?

socialskills,fo6jvd1,t1_fo6clex,1587560617.0,"Yea, I wasn‚Äôt quite sure of the exact social situation you were referring to! Didn‚Äôt realize it was about job related activities. As far as getting hired, that‚Äôs a one time thing. 
Land the job, then you be yourself. Companies are interested in people who can be representational of their company. Doesn‚Äôt mean you need to be that way at all times. I make fun of that saying people ‚Äúact corporate‚Äù all the time. Drives me nuts. 
Good that you‚Äôre using psych to your advantage as well. It makes living life so much easier. 
I used be to so extroverted, wanted to be around people all the time, always enjoyed conversation, etc.
I now am quite the opposite. I can‚Äôt even stand my roommate. When that person tries to talk to me, I have to pretend to be interested and stuff.
Some situations, I guess it‚Äôs appropriate to act a certain type of way, sure. 
This isn‚Äôt how you should be living your life, however! 
As far as getting promoted, it‚Äôs a lot to do with job performance as well. Be better at the job than the other people at work, if you‚Äôre passionate about it. 
Can I have two or three examples of what exactly you mean? How you act, when, and around whom?

socialskills,fo5nbrm,t3_g5jqqs,1587530029.0,"Maybe it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre ‚Äúacting super polished and polite‚Äù. I mean, I don‚Äôt know you but you don‚Äôt seem IMpolite. Maybe acting all polished and proper around others is your problem? Kind of hard to really address this without having more details and knowing you personally. 
You should stop pretending to be any type of way. You should just be yourself. If people don‚Äôt like you, then don‚Äôt entertain them or try to get them to like you. 
You don‚Äôt want fake friends and you don‚Äôt want to be a fake friend either. 
I‚Äôm sure people WILL see you how your S.O. sees you as well. You‚Äôre probably a really likable person. Just don‚Äôt stray too far from who you are. 
Understanding social cues like maybe refraining from talking about sex, drugs, religion, and fun cuss words around people is fine. However, you don‚Äôt need to put on a dog and pony show for people, especially not all the time!

I‚Äôm sorry to hear this is going on. You must be mentally exhausted! 
Relax and be yourself. 

Remember a little psychology about human behavior though...
People really like themselves. 
Often times, if you get people to talk about themselves a lot and what they‚Äôre good at and their goals/accomplishments, they will almost always like you immediately. 
That makes them feel good and you seem even more awesome than you already are! 
You can be yourself while saying less and being more relaxed.
