AskGirls,fqz15x5,t3_glnhxm,1589758065.0,"I think that love letters from your SO are very sweet and romantic! It‚Äôs a great way to show that you love and care about them.

I know a couple girls on here have said that they can be creepy from a classmate/someone who wants to ask you out, and they‚Äôre right. It can be cute to get a handwritten note from a guy asking you out, but not a letter."
AskGirls,fqspurh,t3_gkp93h,1589614674.0,"In general, girls are attracted to guys taller than them. Does that mean it‚Äôs always the case? No, and height certainly won‚Äôt matter to the right girl!

Not to mention a girl can prefer ‚Äútall‚Äù guys without them being the stereotypical tall height, I.e. 6‚Äô0‚Äù+. They can just be attracted to guys taller than them. That‚Äôs what it means to me, as well as many other girls I know. 

In the end, height shouldn‚Äôt factor into whether or not you date someone. Like I said, it won‚Äôt matter much to the right girl. Good luck on your search, good sir! :)"

childfree,foeqfhy,t3_g6ytpj,1587711286.0,"I sympathize with that mother. My brother is autistic as well, and because of COVID he hasn‚Äôt gotten his normal stimulation and his schedule‚Äôs gone haywire. He‚Äôs had many, many meltdowns like this; he screams, throws things and hits me with whatever‚Äôs nearby. It‚Äôs difficult enough with him when there wasn‚Äôt a quarantine; due to the pandemic it‚Äôs causing a downward spiral.

I honestly can‚Äôt take it anymore, and neither can my mom and stepdad. I imagine it‚Äôs hard enough raising a neurotypical child right now, adding mental problems makes it so much worse.

I‚Äôve tried to be patient but it‚Äôs hard when he‚Äôs screaming at the top of his lungs while trying to kill me with a rake.

I hope that mother has the help she needs."

If the closeted person gives the other party permission to out them, then that‚Äôs fine. But regardless, at the end of the day, it‚Äôs up to the closeted person. No one else gets to make that decision.

Needafriend,fkw9fy1,t3_fkzl2l,1584586599.0,"I'm in a similar boat. Graduating from high school, moving into a dorm to live on my own for the first time. Yet I'm not as excited as I should be. Recently I had an epiphany that I'm not as close to my friends as I had believed I was. Not to mention that since we're all going to different universities and will all drift apart. And my family's under quarantine, which doesn't help with my isolation.

If you want to talk, that's cool."
InternetFriends,fkw7mn2,t1_fkvzrhu,1584585347.0,"I wasn't quite sure what advice you wanted specifically, but I'll give some anyway:

I wouldn't limit myself to someone else saving their first kiss for someone special; as much as that would be awesome, it's a very small pool. If you want to do that, that's cool, I personally didn't but you're more than welcome to! My girlfriend didn't save her first kiss for me, and that's okay. 

Be as **vocal** and **communicative** as possible with any of your potential partners. Tell any of your dates that you're saving you first kiss and explain to them why. If you decide to go on a dating app, make that one of the first sentences in your profile. Advertise it as much as possible so that your potential partners know what they're getting into.

I obviously can't give advice for falling in love with someone. But the person you will most likely want to fall in love with is someone who will respect your boundaries. They won't judge you for saving yourself, and they won't try to coerce or manipulate you into kissing them before you're ready. 

When you're 100% sure you're ready (I can't tell you when that'll be; as cliche as it sounds, Love truly is an emotion you just... experience), have a serious discussion with your partner about it. If they're not ready, then wait until they are. If they are ready, then feel free to kiss whenever!"

Honestly your husband sounds like a douche. It takes a village to raise a child but the two most important people in that child‚Äôs life are their parents. Both parents should be active and communicative. I read your comment to someone where you say that he‚Äôs a good dad during the day but a different person during the night, however if he‚Äôs not willing to do a fundamental part of the job then I question his ‚Äúgood parent‚Äù qualities.

I know that taking care of a baby is hard‚ÄîAs a teenager I‚Äôve watched my mom take care of my baby brother‚Äîbut that doesn‚Äôt mean you should ignore a key aspect and saddle your partner with that sole responsibility.

I would recommend you seek marital counseling. Having a professional moderator in the room with you that can offer a third-person perspective can do wonders. You‚Äôre a wonderful mom and you shouldn‚Äôt have to do everything by yourself! :)"
