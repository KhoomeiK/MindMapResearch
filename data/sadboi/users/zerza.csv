Meditation,fosxsrp,t1_fosv4o1,1588040294.0,"Generally I try to keep a mindset open before I start and during the meditation that I actually need it or that I deserve to be kind to myself. If my thoughts start to spiral, become unclear or irrational or I'm just too emotional I know I need at least 30 minutes. If I'm at home it's always something guided. Meditation is something I'm quite new to, especially at this level and it feels nice to know there is a beginning and an end, and that I can forget about the clock ticking while doing it. If I'm sitting on the bus or with people I try to tap in very briefly into the mindset and breathing I have during guided meditation at home. I always lie down at the moment, keep an open and embracing mind to what thoughts might pop up or what I may struggle with during. Maybe even use the time of meditation to actually get some clarity about something bothering me. No guilt or expectations, just dealing with the moment as it stands before me. The breathing is usually in through the nose, out through the nose not set to any specific time phrame either. I feel it constricts the meaning behind the whole thing to keep a sense of accomplishment or right or wrong when it should just be about accepting. Just going by feeling seems to be the best for me. I try to not struggle with my thoughts, if I drift, I drift. I might even linger if I feel rational in my mindset as this can be a good time to work through things. If things get too hard to deal with I put it to the side, and just focus on my breathing. Not push to the side, but saving it for later. When I breathe I imagine colors, this could obviously be any colors but I breathe in blue and red out. I lie as comfortably as I can, tap into my senses as a side note to the breathing and let thoughts come and go. Feeling as my body gets heavier and the couch even comfier.

This is of course a work in progress and it varies day to day, generally I try to keep some longer sessions so that when I'm unable but in need I can more easily tap into the now and focus on my breath. Even rubbing my fingertips together or counting 5 squared objects around town can help a bit. To me the whole thing is about taking a step back and allowing life to be a process I don't have to force."

But with that being said the last week I’ve been taking 0,5mg risperdal in the evening to stabilize my chaotic mood to keep up with work and maintaining paranoia. Really needed it this time and I’m glad I can lean on meds sometimes, even though they aren’t something I would just stick to out of solidarity.

Your reward system will stabilize and you’ll start feeling better.

As for the microdosing. I’ve heard from several online sources that LSD microdosing gives more of a energy boost than shrooms would. For me I got to return to my senses, pulling away from bad thought loops and reset my DMN slightly. I also found a certain calming logic to why I was feeling bad or sad. It was so much better to have it at the surface and I could actually work through certain things during it all. When we trip we always say go with the flow, but when we’re sober we try to push things away and ignore what we are really feeling. The small acid doses motivated me to actually grasp and observe what I was going through. Something I should have done sober as well.

But the real kicker up the hill was on a microdosing day (30-40ug (did 2 days in a row so doubled dose)) and later that afternoon I got really into the mood for a trip so I took 200ug and off I went. On come up I tai chi danced to burial with my headset and shades on and the entire trip was an introspective, emtional and very laugh filled time for both me and my gf. The next morning on the bus to work I put some music on and started breathing heavily like I was about to finish getting a sensual bj because the music was so good haha. Reborn and all.

I guess once we get sober we usually get completely sober and that lifeline to joy and escape gets taken away, so it’s harder to break the cycle when (at least for me) drugs were both savior and sin. I got some perspective basically, I feel more alligned. Might not have much to do with the microdosing but it definitely helped. 

Tldr: Overall I have just started accepting that everything is a process and I kinda get glad for the opportunity to work through something painful, making it last that much shorter."

Don’t feel ashamed for being dealt a horrible hand and reacting to it as a human. To answer your question, yes you deserve to live and it’s life your parents wanted for you.

All I can say for advice without knowing your story is to value the moment. No I don’t mean blindly appreciating being alive since that is hard when things are rough. But rather to use the moment to your advantage. If you notice you are slouching in your chair, sit up straight. If you wanna knock off a few pounds or eat less sugar, 1 spoon instead of two in your coffee. Waiting for the water to boil, do some push ups or wash the sink. The list is endless and you can choose what works for you. Adding these up will rewire the idea that self destruction is the solution and progress will be the new carrot. It’s madness to solve a bad feeling or situation by destroying what you already have.

StopSpeeding,f5k0ih2,t3_do57c5,1572250272.0,"Can relate a lot to the fantasizing high. Just the image in my head of the powder lying infront of ready to go up my nose gets me high in a way. But take it from me, every time I had those thoughts and ended up using I was always disappointed with the effect when I actually got it. Turning the high into anxiety and then more using just to make up the fact I felt like shit about doing it in the first place. If you want to take care of your psyche, not to mention your life and the life of those around you, don’t. Figure out what you would do if it wasn’t even an option and eventually your brain will trigger the will for other things instead of self destruction."

Now 1 month later of daily usage I can safely say I get quite good effects from it. Social anxiety is down, I can focus like I’m on stims and all the negative side effects of coffee are gone."
addiction,f599w1q,t3_dn7qpn,1572078617.0,"Personally, like mentioned here earlier I actually got excited about being sober. 

For too long the answer and go-to strategy for any mishap or struggle was to get high, as well as celebrating. I had been struggling off and on for 8 years and amongst my addict peers there was nothing abnormal about it all. We shrugged off a relapse as nothing, avoided discussing the major issues that came along with it all and all of us were in some way in the same boat. However when I met my current girlfriend earlier this year we both were getting more and more hooked on amphetamines and for me a lot of other stuff. Over a year ago she had barely used drugs at all so all of this was so fresh. It really woke me up to the reality of it all when we discussed the usage and finally I had someone to talk to about it that didn’t take that life for granted. She also made me open up and share things about myself that I didn’t even acknowledge was there, making for a very comfortable transition as I had emotional support from someone who understood me. If I had continued I would end up in the hospital again and just sitting on the bus with 140 bpm, inner panic attack and full blown psychosis which led me to dislocate my jaw just from inner tension I knew where I wanted to be, and running from the mountain wasn’t it. I was just ready I guess. 

Celebrating one month very soon, very excited!

Tldr: Enjoyment of the challenge to get to a better place and swap one bad addiction for other healthy ones was what made me get clean."

StopSpeeding,f0wczpy,t3_d6xk5q,1569004571.0,Coffee for wd (with some L-theanine) is very good and surprisingly very easy to fall asleep on. But after a while 10 cups is a little on the heavy side.
