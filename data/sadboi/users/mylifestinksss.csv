Sometimes, you know that your life is over and you will only suffer if you keep living. I also feel like an outsider, like I'm not a part of society. People who don't feel this way, who have had so much support and love, will never understand this. I understand you about being a wage slave. I honestly feel like life is only worth living if you have a high income, no mental disorders, a very loving family, and very good physical health.

It's kind of paradoxical because I'm feeling very isolated, but that type of socialization I prefer is not one that is not driven by work. I like it when it's more genuine. 

Social media - I don't use it, but I imagine people aren't saying ""This person is my world"" because they are trapped at home with them all day without anything to do. 

The only things I miss are being able to go to the gym...and being able to get a haircut.

I also can never have a happy and fulfilling life due to my mental problems. So, the fact that everyone is struggling now is kind of nice because I don't feel like the only one."

Gianna was an incredible basketball player and I know in my heart she would have made it to the WNBA. 

Kobe Bryant was also one of my heros. I've been following him since his rookie year. I've seen him go through the ups and downs with the Lakers. I think my favorite part of his career was his championship in 2010.

I don't have any children. I cannot imagine how it must be for three of his daughters to now grow up without a father. And he's not just any father. He is one of the most loving and accomplished people out there. His wife must be suffering immensely now. Not to mention all of his friends - Magic, Jeanie, Shaq, etc. They all lost a very good friend who gave them so many incredible moments. Kobe had so much left to give this world and now we will never get a chance to see it."

I am also a lover. But unfortunately, that kind of thing isn't rewarded. I want affection but you have to jump through so many hoops to get it that it becomes not worth the trouble.

It really sucks when you know that there are people who have no where near the education and skills you do, but they have a better life because they were not traumatized."

kids - lol.  i don't want some kid to be traumatized the way i was

u/NoReason87 is completely right. The fact that society dictates what you should do is incredibly depressing when you know you are not like others. Having children is going to be a disaster for many people. Mental health problems, increasing costs of everything, lack of basic services, etc etc. 

My parents had children because they wanted to fit in society but our family is a total mess.  We are a laughingstock. I think people actually pity us because of how inferior we are."

Also, that's not likely to change someone's mind. If they are in pain, thinking of others missing them won't end the pain. 

Some people will miss me, but they are toxic anyway so I couldn't give a fuck if they feel hurt."

depression,ffcn1fm,t3_essxe0,1579802928.0,"Life is not fair.  I had no chance in life to be happy. My family is beyond toxic and my life has been very traumatic. I'm surprised I'm still here. I don't feel human at all.

  
Some people say you ""have to put the work in"" to be happy. Not with me. I put in  all the work I can to be happy and I'm still a defective person. If you have mental issues, you can't be happy even if you try. 

Try meds. They might help."
