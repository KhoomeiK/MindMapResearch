TrueAskReddit,exry6pj,t3_ctue38,1566527094.0,"I'm not convinced it's actually as bad as people claim it is and that many of the problems are caused by ignorant fuckwit patients and not hospitals/insurers.

My aunt works as a nurse and there is a patient on her floor who has been in the hospital for 8 months. There is nothing wrong with him but because he has nowhere to go they cannot legally discharge him. This guy also has no money so when he finally does leave of his own volition the hospital will eat hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs. These costs will then be distributed to other patients who have insurance and will pay.

A large part of why so much unnecessary medical testing is performed in this country is that patients get to choose their doctors. Doctors would rather perform an unnecessary procedure and keep a patient than not perform it and have their unhappy patient go to another doctor who will do it.

Similar things happen with pain pills. The addicts know which doctors will prescribe the opiates they crave no questions asked and which ones won't. All they have to do is ask around to find out which doctors are ""nice"" and which doctors are ""mean"". Allowing patients to choose their doctors fuels this problem.

All of these problems are fueled by patients and family members who think that they know more about medicine as a semiliterate high school dropout than the person with decades of experience. My aunt has half a million stories about people trying to tell her how to do her job, not realizing that their wrong and stupid, and then going to the charge nurse (which she often is) to complain.

There are problems with our healthcare system but all the stupid people in the public hold a large portion of the blame."

AskReddit,exhxcbr,t1_exhg362,1566316345.0,"Because it wasn't resolved well and Germany was forced into accepting the Versailles Treaty.

Erich Ludendorff was effectively Germany's military dictator during WWI and he allowed the war to go on far too long. For a length of time after Russia withdrew from the fighting Germany made significant progress on the Western front. But with America's entry into the war and dwindling supplies of coal and steel the tide turned against Germany.

Had Ludendorff pushed for a peace treaty at the height of his success the French and British would have certainly accepted a more favorable deal. The problem was that when Germany was forced to accept an armistice they had no bargaining chips left.

Before the end of the war, Ludendorff began pushing the idea that Germany's defeat was not because of his failures but rather because the civilian puppet government he instituted and the communists on the home front were undermining the army. In the interwar years he continued to push this idea and the German populace, bitter about their defeat, ate it up.

Hitler was only one of many angry veterans to join Ludendorff's Nazi Party. He's just the only one we learn about in school because he was the first to reach power and then successfully assassinated all of his rival Nazis.

TrueAskReddit,ewkyx5r,t3_cmr2pf,1565499160.0,"I've often seen gun control opponents argue that laws making it illegal to shoot a gun inside city limits or on school property are useless because if someone is going to murder a lot of people that law won't stop them. 

Although this is true, it ignores the actual goal of those laws: preventing accidental shootings. I've seen videos of people shooting guns into the air during celebrations and people target shooting at their backyard fence inside a town. What those idiots don't recognize is that every bullet lands somewhere and sometimes they land in people. Having the ability to take guns away from reckless idiots who place other people's lives in danger prevents accidental shootings.

Gun control opponents often argue that violence in cities that have strict gun-control measures such as Chicago proves that these laws don't work.

It turns out that a very large portion of the guns used to commit violent crimes in Chicago were purchased out of state. Indiana is only a 3 hour drive from Chicago and has very lax laws. This really shows that Chicago's laws are effective but they're undermined by nearby states with weak laws.
