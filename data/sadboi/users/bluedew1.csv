So backs in general are the worst spot to try scritch any small bird (as a general rule).

Trust building is a big factor, and this is done in lots of different ways. Again someone else already mentioned treats and baths. You can also reinforce trust in her by quickly backing off when she indicates that she doesn't like something you've done. I'd recommend for now just building trust towards touch in general, like hand perching & eating from your hand, before trying the head scritches again.

If it's not as dark as it looks in the image, then I'd definitely be concerned because it means that it's likely not gender-transition related, and more likely dry discharge. People's comments so far are banking on how dark it is and relating this to potential gender development. Maybe my monitor's display isn't showing the colours as they are in real life, and I'm aware some birds develop later than others- based on the deep to light blue I can see in your first pictures, I highly doubt this is a late development. Before turning brown, females have a more white cere- sometimes with pink, purples or blues mixed in, sure, but the white still dominates. Here, blue obviously dominates.

On top of this, the photo on this thread shows that while it's mostly brown now, you can still see some of that light blue behind the brown- again if it was a developing female, that would be white, not blue.

This might be silly, but if you can give it a try- get a wet paper towel and gently try wiping their cere (no pressure applied). If it's dry snot/discharge like I've seen on my boys, it should wipe off after a few tries (depending how thick it is anyway). Have you noticed any behaviour changes in your bird? Things like sleeping more than usual, seeking heat/warm spots in the house/cage, sitting around while fluffed up more than usual, not eating/drinking as much as usual, not foraging/playing as much as usual?"

You can also see in this photo a tinge of blue in background that looks white at first glance, but is actually blue. **OP- I would be hurrying to a vet if I were you.** This is a male bird, not female, and this change in colour looks to be indicating something's wrong with your bird's health.

LGBDropTheT,fh7ckbx,t1_fh7bvs1,1581324776.0,"We got a similar treatment, and this treatment is unfortunately very prevalent today. Even in countries where law supports LGB rights, we still face common issues. While Asexuality is not criminalized, that's the only aspect we don't share with LGB as far as I've seen. We are very much shunned and commonly treated as a mental or biological illness.

It's common for example that an asexual person will not disclose information related to their sexual activity (or lack thereof) for fear of 'conversion therapy' being pushed on them (again, even in countries where law supports LGB rights). We are also often subject to ""corrective rape"" with little to no coverage or discussion on the subject (essentially someone thinks they can ""cure"" asexuality by having sex with the person, unsure if this is a similar thing experienced by LGB).

Ah okay, thank you for pointing me in the right direction! I'd only read the ""About Us"" section, not the sub-specific rules. If I may ask this sub, what is your opinion/reasoning behind the belief that gender dysphoria (or GID) is not a real/valid mental illness/disorder?

In the case of asexuality, it is not recognised and still commonly treated as a medical issue as a result, something homosexuality is no stranger to.

And while atheism isn't considered a religion itself, it's still considered a type of religious view in the wider understanding of that category. (For example, someone's online profile can say ""Religious Views: Atheist"".) A different example, looking at the light spectrum: black isn't a colour, it's the absence of light.
