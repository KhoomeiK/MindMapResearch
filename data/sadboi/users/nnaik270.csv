I went with the taycan because they mentioned it would be a familiar driver for other Porsche owners..Also here in SF there are so many Tesla’s I kinda wanted to be different you know?
TeslaModel3,ezwjhss,t3_d2qw94,1568218115.0,Didn’t enjoy it when I test drove it( don’t hate at me haha). Ended up going for the taycan instead as I’ve kinda always been a Porsche guy
