AskRedditAfterDark,fqlt56f,t1_fqlpr4b,1589465580.0,"I personally find Mirena the best - once it's in you can forget about it. It also lightens periods, the hormone in it doesn't enter the bloodstream and it's more effective than tubal ligation. Downsides are that the insertion can be unpleasant, strings can poke ...foreign bodies... if the strings are cut too short (doctor dependent) and IUDs are pretty invasive just by their nature. Not cheap, plus there are insertion fees (I got mine funded by our NHS for anaemia somehow). Lasts 5 years, but a lot of doctors are saying the can last up to 7.


Paragard/copper IUD - completely non-hormonal, most effective form of bc. Worst side effect is increased cramping and a heavier flow. Insertion sucks, but once it's in it last up to 10 years. Fairly cheap, but insertion costs. Not good if you have a copper allergy - my friend found out she had one shortly after get hers put in... terrible luck.


Condoms are obviously great, personally hate the smell, but safe sex it important! I've never tried female condoms.


Depo - haven't tried personally, but it's a mixed bag from what my family and friends have said - one lost her hair whilst others stopped having periods with no other side effects. I guess it has wider ranging side effects because it's in the bloodstream? For adverse reactions you have no choice but to wait the full 6 months for it to leave your bloodstream.


I'm probably not the best person to ask simply because I can't take bc that could affect my mood (bipolar- unfortunately didn't know I had it at the time I tried the pill). I'm all for bc you can whip in and forget about though lol - wish IUDs didn't have such a bad history overshadowing them.

bipolar,fq82nc8,t1_fq6mbmw,1589157249.0,"Not my aunts thankfully, but I've seen psych nurses in more of a mood monitoring/supportive role in some clinics. They were kind of a stop gap between my GP and psychiatrist. They'd all meet up regularly and discuss treatment plans for patients like me who weren't unwell enough to be considered for the crisis teams, but not well enough to be managed solely by a GP. Mine was lovely, apparently they scouted her for the job. I think that was an unusual set up (was a university clinic), really good though. Wish it was more common, they take your physical health into consideration more and it means the psychiatrist can see more people, but you still see someone weekly. I was their guinea pig for the programme apparently! A very lucky guinea pig.


Most are in the role you say, I've never really been in the position to interact with them much. Not entirely sure what my aunts do (not close to them strangely enough), but they work in large hospitals.  Hopefully so large they never encounter patients..."
CrappyDesign,fq5u8vj,t1_fq5ilsi,1589117601.0,"I cook it 1 or 2 minutes more so I'm not doubled over in pain the next day. IBS is wonderful. I dont really eat pasta now, only wholemeal penne in a pinch."
CrappyDesign,fq5u1tk,t1_fq5i08x,1589117451.0,"Plus pasta isn't necessarily part of everyone's diet - I very rarely had it as a kid (Mum is very Welsh so we ate mostly welsh food). I don't eat it now either, so I have to read packets for this sort of thing. It's just lack of familiarity, I can't be the only one."
CrappyDesign,fq5tqj8,t1_fq5dv45,1589117216.0,But then it's hard to digest :( I can only really eat wholemeal pasta now or I spend the next few days in pain.

Really appreciate your reply :) The transition is the part that scares me about this whole thing."

bipolar,fq5awab,t1_fq59cfi,1589098487.0,"Yeah, I think they're desensitized to a lot of it. One of them couldn't understand why people with bipolar can't just snap out of it. Glad I don't know her in a therapeutic context, I wouldn't want to be emotionally vulnerable around her.


We never really see our neighbour much, he's bordering on being a shut in. Super quiet, we just see police cars at his place from time to time. We sometimes give him food that's ready to eat, he gets pretty thin when things are bad. Basically just a quiet dude. Dad just doesn't make the connection between me and him. He barely registered that I had a diagnosis for years, probably for the reasons you mentioned - you hit the nail on the head. He's sensitive most of the time, this is just a blind spot of his.


Mum is great - made her eggs bennie and pork roast and watched british comedies! Death at a funeral is a classic... Love her to bits."
bipolar,fq55tiw,t1_fq5463w,1589093461.0,"Yep, it's important for people to know their limits as a support person. Really shitty timing for you though. 


I wasn't perfect, but I was managing my moods well. I wasn't drinking or doing drugs, no caffeine, regular exercise, CBT etc. I was also graduating and had jobs lined up in my career path. I still had minor episodes, but they were only for several days max and weren't enough to derail things. The worst part was fatigue from my perspective. He put zero effort into managing his depression, he wouldn't turn up to doctors appointments I made him or make lifestyle changes. Really frustrating, I just wanted him to stop hurting so much. Nice guy despite all of that. Being depressed can really bring out the worst in people.


Basically, the shottiest part was him announcing my condition on social media and making me out to be some sort of villain. Really hypocritical and nasty. I can respect it if someone can't cope and break up because of that, but his reaction was totally uncalled for. I will never understand why he did that. 


I plan to be a cat lady now, they're more fulfilling than a partner, I can force them to get medical treatment and don't use social media."
bipolar,fq544rm,t1_fq3nfkl,1589091915.0,"Meanwhile, vitamin B6 makes me actively suicidal... Meds are my saviours. Exercise is great, but it's impossible without being in an okay place for me, which is mostly facilitated by meds."
bipolar,fq53s84,t1_fq4vp0e,1589091606.0,"My family has two psychiatric nurses... they've treated me with the most stigma put of everyone. Opposite of what you'd think. Also concerning that they could treat their patients like that.


Dad refers to the guy down the road with bipolar (he has welfare checks regularly, poor dude - mum and I check up on him regularly) as a 'mental' - he doesn't understand I'm also a 'mental' by his definition. He doesn't mean to be nasty, gets defensive and upset when it's pointed out. He's 73 so changing those views is an uphill battle.


My Mum is amazing though, I probably wouldn't be alive without her. She was a general nurse and worked in a psychiatric hospital years ago - very empathetic and will just sit with me until I can talk when my depression hits."
bipolar,fq536xf,t1_fq49c27,1589091087.0,I think part of the struggle is that the symptoms from their perspective are behavioural rather than physical. People kind of suck at understanding that there are experiences outside of their own as well.
bipolar,fq52ghh,t1_fpy9ki2,1589090448.0,"My ex did something similar, said some really nasty things about it to me and on fb. A few weeks later and his sister (who he had just moved in with) was diagnosed with it, even more severe than mine... I wouldn't wish mental illness on my worst enemy, but it almost seemed like some sort of divine retribution for him. I hope he treats his sister better."
bipolar,fq51syz,t1_fq29ct6,1589089892.0,I think the key here is 'self reported'... interesting though.

I'm lucky that paranoia doesn't hit me until I'm after work, and even then it's rare, it's never really been much of a thing for me. The paranoia I've experienced makes me feel for you, I find it very unpleasant, especially afterwards..."
4chan,fq04ctt,t1_fpzq8zd,1589027500.0,Haha wish I could've done something similar to a dude I encountered last week - he just left his trolley to roll onto a busy road and drove off. I had to go running after it to stop it causing an accident. What an absolute cunt.
