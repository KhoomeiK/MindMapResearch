vipkid,fpvpwuy,t3_gfscgo,1588949641.0,I had a student draw stripes on her face once. Still not as bad as shaving an eyebrow off
vipkid,fpqy60b,t3_gf07jh,1588835861.0,Last time I was sick I did not have a doctors note. I had to pay $10 for each missed class but it did not affect my record. Best wishes to you. Feel better!!!

vipkid,fpc27ib,t3_gclj0l,1588485258.0,It probably has nothing to do with the assessment and more to do with the Coronavirus and it's economic impact.
vipkid,fov4373,t3_g9jj0w,1588095052.0,I have actually been doing pretty good. I have less bookings overall (especially compared to a few months ago) but I am still getting enough to feel satisfied and not burned out.

vipkid,foqmijy,t3_g8zxqi,1587996766.0,"Unfortunately you joined at kind of a bad time :( there is a LOT of competition now as soooo many other teachers are joining now. My only advice would be to be patient with it. Summer usually doesn‚Äôt bring the best bookings either. Basically, you may have to wait several months to get a consistent schedule of bookings."
90DayFiance,foqm011,t3_g8wrcc,1587996463.0,"Does he have like no public speaking experience or what? I‚Äôm honestly really happy I went to college and have some experience speaking to large audiences because:

A. I would have prepared a better presentation, B. I would (probably) have been able to think of a response. 

That chick didn‚Äôt ask a super hard question or anything. He could have thought of something to say if he didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs brain.‚Äù"
vipkid,foql2r6,t3_g90247,1587995911.0,"I‚Äôm getting a bit less bookings - maybe 15%-20% less than in previous months. I‚Äôve actually been pretty happy with my bookings though as I am a bit burnt out from teaching crazy hours for the first months of the quarantine.

Oh, and my bookings are basically all regulars. I got a TNS last week so naturally I didn‚Äôt get any new students this week."
vipkid,fophu4k,t3_g8qhwc,1587961876.0,Unfortunately you joined at a time when a TON of other people are applying :/ you may also be waiting for bookings for a while...

vipkid,foihqtk,t3_g7kt3l,1587786946.0,I actually got a few cancelations for tonight and tomorrow night. I am usually very busy during the weekends.

Shallontourage,fofrq3g,t3_g4khvb,1587741645.0,"I watched a few of this chick‚Äôs videos because I watch a lot of ‚Äútea‚Äù YT videos. I always thought it was strange that she was acting like an armchair psychologist, diagnosing the Kardashians and what not. And now all of this..."
thesims,fo8j2or,t1_fo6ef1j,1587597529.0,I think they do it to keep in touch with the old school sims. Sims 1 and 2 were pretty basic in some regards and that was a lot of the charm of the game(s).
vipkid,fo3dumk,t1_fo2f7sl,1587485210.0,"I totally agree, VIPKID is not a career. But for the past 6 months or so it is been my full-time job. So far I have not had problems with bookings, maybe a slight decrease. VIPKID is something I do 5-6 hours a day, 6 days a week, so for me, it‚Äôs worth it. All my other props are cheap things I got from the dollar store or printed off at home. That‚Äôs my justification, if you were wondering üòÇbest wishes!"
vipkid,fo3c0bb,t1_fo2jkah,1587484292.0,"As the other person said, props really don‚Äôt matter that much. Prior to this, I had just printed out a bunch of stuff I found on the internet. I was actually kind of anti-props for my first year and I still got bookings (meaning props aren‚Äôt that important after all). I totally agree though, it would be nice to get a small package from them with some basics. It would definitely make us teachers feel more inclusive with the company."
vipkid,fo2bdtz,t1_fo226rm,1587456022.0,Yas!! The kids sure love pizza üòÇand hamburgers.
vipkid,fo2bbmw,t1_fo298pl,1587455956.0,"I don‚Äôt have kids. I make about $100 bucks a day doing VIPKID so for me it‚Äôs an investment. I figured I can sacrifice one day‚Äôs worth of wages for props from a reputable company. And in turn write it off on my taxes.

Also, I have all my props on display in my office so I wanted nice looking ones. There are definitely cheaper ones available."
vipkid,fo2b3ag,t1_fo1wsfo,1587455719.0,There are lots of sets on amazon! Some that are much cheaper.
vipkid,fo1nabg,t1_fo1mztv,1587437044.0,"It‚Äôs on a cart, the top shelf I have all my essential props. I prep a few mins before class and grab props beforehand."

vipkid,fo1d835,t1_fo0t72f,1587430761.0,Errr they were kind of pricy. I spend like $70 bucks (there are more not pictured). I got them on amazon and there were definitely cheaper alternatives!
vipkid,fo1d5ik,t1_fo0l9fo,1587430717.0,Omg yes! Once I saw they had a rice bowl I was sold üòÇ
solotravel,fnzfkdn,t3_g4syyo,1587393088.0,There are so many places to see in the world and unfortunately many people have not heard of your country. I myself am a female solo traveler and would not feel safe or comfortable going there (based off preconceived perceptions of Africa as a whole).
vipkid,fnzewza,t3_g4s5lr,1587392718.0,"I try to think of it more as if we are teaching them the English words for math. Yes, my students can add 5 + 5. But do they know what the words plus and equals are? Not always."

vipkid,fntnnsj,t1_fnth3bu,1587245301.0,Ahh I see. Maybe the 2015 cameras were still good :( it‚Äôs a bummer cause Apple computers are so expensive! Besides that I still like my new MacBook. The external camera isn‚Äôt a huge hassle.
vipkid,fntfg4x,t1_fntdsp4,1587240580.0,What macbook do you have? I found my 2012 MacBook camera was significantly better than my 2018 MacBook camera. I didn‚Äôt use an external camera for my 2012 but my 2018 camera is unusable (in my opinion). Especially compared to the excellent video quality of my 1080p logi webcam. I guess it also depends how picky you are about quality.
vipkid,fntawht,t3_g3neom,1587238010.0,Don‚Äôt get the new MacBooks if you want a good webcam. The quality is HORRIBLE! Unless you don‚Äôt mind buying an external webcam. I actually just bought a used iMac and I love it. The webcam is also bad but it‚Äôs nice having a big screen. Cromebooks are also good if you are looking for a burger option.
unpopularopinion,fnr3nlf,t3_g3appc,1587178511.0,Yes. But there are also guys who will definitely fuck your if you are gone and they are not. It‚Äôs a gray zone.
90DayFiance,fnqghh3,t3_g36mfq,1587164128.0,My problem with her is that she has this huge narrative about herself and is making the relationship to be ALL about her. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs playing the victim and is just complaining to Erika the whole time. Like do they actually have anything in common or hang out and have a good time? I realize this is TLC scripted but Stephanie is just super self centered.

NoStupidQuestions,fnnomjb,t3_g2j2fi,1587097437.0,I went through a phase like this when I first started working at home. It was working really long hours late into the night and was getting super burned out. I now try to have more of a ‚Äúroutine‚Äù and make sure I am productive during the day.

solotravel,fnfrmvc,t3_g1i2ez,1586914029.0,I was suppose to go this summer on a WHV. I got my flights and everything. I am planning on postponing until 2021. The economy may not be so good though.
lululemon,fnfrcqo,t3_g1fqu5,1586913860.0,I also got an align too small. I got a 6 and I should have gotten an 8. It has stretched a little bit not a lot. I guess this will have to be motivation for me to lose those extra 5-10lbs!
vipkid,fnfaa7h,t1_fneyj0p,1586904305.0,That‚Äôs so stupid. They can offer them positions as firemen. We clearly do not have enough firemen!
Reno,fnf1urn,t3_g1dxhu,1586899868.0,"Unfortunately, we are living in some rough times and perhaps petty crime such as this is increasing. I personally do not leave anything in my car, especially anything visible to the eye. Lots of car break ins and such going on, even up in Somersett."

vipkid,fncqax8,t3_g0iyfq,1586843779.0,I‚Äôm happy they do because I‚Äôm so bad at pronouncing their real names üòÇ haha but my dad works for a Taiwanese company and all of his colleagues go by their English names. It makes sense since English is the lingua franca of the business world.
vipkid,fnc1iqg,t3_g0vvr0,1586826663.0,I looked this name up and it translates to small/little child.... I think. I‚Äôve probably had at least 6 or 7 trials with this as the name. Thoughts??

vipkid,fn6wf4p,t3_fzsm2s,1586708671.0,Now is a really bad time to join unfortunately. You may spend a lot of effort going through the hiring process to get very few bookings. You will probably have a very hard time competing for students since there so many teachers right now.
