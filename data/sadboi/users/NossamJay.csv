Things that get you involved with communities will definitely be something you can use a one tracker mind to improve or grow.

Aphantasia,fp4xq30,t3_gb4189,1588310195.0,"My advice is DON‚ÄôT. What I‚Äôm gonna tell you might sound like a silly story, but I‚Äôm convinced it was eventually what started my decline in my mental state. I tried for years as a kid to lucid dream. I studied it and eventually achieved it through lots of journaling and mediation/hypnosis. I set up my center of focus that I would arrive in as the old tube tv we had in my family room as a young kid. 

I would start my dream flipping through channels on that old fashioned tube tv in a black room. This was my center of focus, and from that I could build around it, and by thinking of blinking I could essentially change the thought channels. I was much younger then. 

I was able tot do this for a few months, but I slowly lost control of it. I could come back to that center of focus tv black room, but I had less and less control as time went on. The more I did it the more things like channels flipping on their own would happen. 

Pretty soon this was the start of every dream whether I wanted it or not. I would start flipping through channels uncontrollably and occasionally I would see terrifying images flash for a couple seconds or a shadow lurking in a corner, but otherwise everything was fine. 

Soon the tv room became a twisted dark nightmare of mine. I was still fully conscious I was dreaming, but I had no control left. I don‚Äôt know what to call it. Demons, ghouls, bad thoughts would invade every dream related to the TV. Even if it was a good dream. Slowly every dream would become a nightmare and half the time I would wake up drenched in a cold sweat. I was left terrified to even go to bed, but I would always slip into unconsciousness and that room. 

Every dream would start with the knobs on the tv scrolling out of control and flashing through hundreds of different dream channels till I eventually landed at my inevitable nightmare. I saw things that stick with me to this day despite not being able to see it. 

I am on the severe spectrum for aphantasia, but I still can see flashes of images out of nowhere that aren‚Äôt pulled up by command once every couple of months. My advice is to never try to lucid dream. I think because we can‚Äôt consciously pull up images, the mind plays games with us, and when we think we had control we never really did. Hence why the one time you try it, it ends in a horrible way."

DiagnoseMe,fopk7qm,t3_g8tanq,1587963692.0,"Obligatory NAD: 

That cut looks fairly deep and a lot more like a cut than a gash or a tear. So that rules out injuries like hitting head on the corner of a wall or a table most likely. The fact that it doesn‚Äôt bleed much points to the fact that the wound was sliced fairly cleanly and quickly meaning less trauma to the tissue and less blood vessels that were opened. Less trauma also means less bleeding.  

I‚Äôm assuming that the object she hit her head on or hit herself with was metal. 

It‚Äôs closer to the top of the forehead which makes this an interesting location. It seems like it was either a slip up with a tool like a spoon, or someone else hit her with the straight edge of a metal toy. 

I see no bruising, or any major signs of trauma though, so whatever the object was, it was fairly light. 

No other signs of injury shows that this was a very limited injury. 

My final guess is that this was the rim of a metal cup or a spoon."
