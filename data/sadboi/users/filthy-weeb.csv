BPD,fqfwtsg,t1_fqfvegj,1589333268.0,"That sounds really mature of you, honestly. I was a mess after my breakup and constantly cried and begged my partner to take me back. He gave me multiple chances in the following months after our breakup to make changes and possibly get back with him, but I continued pushing him away despite wanting to be with him. It was too much for him and he decided it was time to move on, and he made it clear that he wanted nothing to do with me while we were apart. There's no way for me to contact him anymore since he has blocked me off completely.

I haven't made any significant progress since the breakup and I know treatment is long-term, but I have this hope that once I get better I can reconnect with him and try again."
