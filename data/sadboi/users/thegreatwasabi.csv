LuigisMansion,fqrf9vm,t3_gkj0cb,1589583199.0,"Agree

I could argue its the best looking Switch game to date"
NintendoSwitch,fqls93e,t3_gjlvq0,1589465095.0,What is with Nintendo dropping this big title so soon to release and out of nowhere? I would\`ve loved to see this in a big june direct (with the holiday title included and the newest smash character as well)
Cuphead,fqehkq0,t3_giapmn,1589307673.0,"I believe it depends directly on your skill. It took me almost 50 hours to beat it both on normal and expert mode, but the replaybability and music are out of this world. **Definitely  a** must buy imo"

And that soundtrack tho"
coversongs,fmw8hiw,t1_fmw40hx,1586441760.0,"DEFINITELY. All the songs have layer after layer and make it a pain, but very enjoyable not the less"
coversongs,fmt3o8t,t1_fmt34t5,1586366355.0,"Totally agree. It may not be the greatest instrumental display of his work, but definitely one of his most emotional.  


Fav Tracks: Edge Of Desire, All We Ever Do is Say Goodbye, Assassin, and Friends, Lovers, or Nothing (that outro specially)  


Least fav track: Do you know me"
coversongs,fmt2k3y,t3_fx8f25,1586365842.0,One of Johns most underrated songs. Great Job!

Coronavirus,fkkdsbq,t3_fj1m3e,1584281524.0,"So everything in my country is suspended as well. I work at a hospital so we're under activity suspension until further notice.

My question is... Can I go for a run in the streets if my country isn't officially ""on lockdown""?
I know how the virus spreads but I'm sure the streets won't be crowded , but I'm not willing to risk it."

EatingDisorders,fk18kw4,t3_fft4ix,1583774603.0,"I know this probably won't work for everyone, but I just avoid them completely. I went to a psychiatrist and described all of my symptoms, and he described it as a literal addiction. As it goes, I started to treat it as such, much like an alcoholic.

Not one day goes by when I don't want it , but I started it avoiding everything that makes me go into the self-loathing phase that comes after binge eating.

Been doing it for 48 days now and never felt better."
JohnMayer,fhacf8g,t3_f20oi5,1581404416.0,"I think it serves its exact purpose. Its a way of letting you know that he cant let go to something he knows its hurting him. The way he repeats the song title, each with a slightly different pitch, could be interpreted as an analogy for everytime he tries to say goodbye but cant. He just cant escape the burden of letting go.

Absolute masterpiece imo.  Second best song of the record, just shy of Edge of Desire."
