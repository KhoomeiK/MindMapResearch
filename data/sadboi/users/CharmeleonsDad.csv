Also, he’s an extraordinary person with superhuman honor and courage and not representative of your typical INFJ or anyone most of us would likely know.

There’s also a core problem with ENTJ memes. Memes are either popular because they say, “I suck”, or “people suck”. Te Hero doesn’t find “I suck, u relate?” to be funny, interesting, or entertaining, and Fi Inferior doesn’t find it comforting, nor cute. Neither does it possess the orientation to say “I’m awesome” in meme format.

Therefore, that leaves the “people suck” kind of meme. Se Child understands however that an echo chamber of negativity just gives bad experiences and pushes people away, and Ni Parent instinctively sees there’s no discernible value in doing that even if potentially gratifying in the moment."
entj,fqxqlnn,t1_fqxg5wu,1589736356.0,"Goku is ESFJ, and Itachi is ISFJ :). Orihime Inoue is ENFP. 

Naruto as an orphan not allowed to be himself relied heavily on his ENFP Unconscious throughout childhood. Around the Hidan/Kakuzu arc you see him shift more into his INFJ Ego. 

Luffy is different in that he is extraordinarily well-integrated from the start of the series, especially with his ESTP Subconscious. 

Both are defined early on by a laser-like focus on a singular goal. The Hero function is called the apex of the ego. Goku *never* had this ambition of becoming anything, he just loves to fight! Ni is like a sniper rifle, Ne a shotgun. Neither Naruto not Luffy can tolerate a state of multiple possibilities, which is the world Ne Hero lives in. When Luffy finally realized the Merry couldn’t go on, he required isolation and withdrawal to make his decision. He did not seek to gather more possibilities and external data points like Ne-Te does. 

Naruto’s sense of right and wrong is anchored by Fe Parent, defined by a strong, responsible, and intrinsic operation of ethics focused on the group and how people are effected. Luffy has a literal superpower for reading others’ feelings. Both are hyperfocused on justice and *instantly* know what’s wrong when they see it and what they have to do. 

Both share Ti Child, giving them that innocent and divine mastery over logic. INFJs often come off “dumb” because Te Trickster absolutely hates lectures and can’t pay attention for the life of it, and Si Demon has trouble retaining information. They can give the illusion of being airheaded and just doing “whatever” in the moment, but Ti Child is extremely capable and instantly detects inconsistencies and hypocrisy that it won’t stand for. Optimistic Ni-Ti gives both their (often necessary) impenetrable stubbornness. 

Both of their ambitions are influenced by Se Inferior/Aspirational, with Luffy’s Se being more Aspirational of the two until Naruto develops later on. Se demands loyalty and attention. Kid Naruto was transparently motivated by an Se reality where he’s respected and given loyalty. Luffy’s stated goal is more open to interpretation. Inferior Se showed in the loyalty check of pushing away Usopp on Water 7. It’s a weakness that was exposed when Se Inferior had already been attacked by the strain of Robin appearing disloyal. 

Ne Nemesis is a recurring element in both series that is externally manifested. Most antagonists have their own Ni vision or dream that Naruto or Luffy come face-to-face against. Every Hero is only as good as its Nemesis, and the core force of each conflict is a battle of ideologies and futures. Oda even said Luffy prefers to “crush the dreams of his enemies”. 

ENFPs, on the other hand, often spend half their lives finding themselves and figuring out what they even want to do, because Ne Hero perceives so many possible futures that to collapse those possibilities down into one is antagonistic (Ni Nemesis).

Orihime Inoue, ENFP, Ne Hero-Fi Parent:

“There are a lot of things i wanted to do. I wanted to become a teacher, and an astronaut, and a baker…I wanted to go to a bunch of different donut shops and ask for one of everything! And I wanted to tell the ice-cream man to give me one of everything, too! I wish i could have five lives! Then i could have been born in five different towns, and eaten five lifetime’s worth of food, and had five different careers, and…fallen in love with the same person, five times.”

Makes it all the sweeter that INFJs and ENFPs are each other’s golden pair, as that’s one of the most romantic things an INFJ could hear, although they’d be unlikely to say that themselves unless heavily Shadow-focused. Ni-Se is well aware that there is only one reality, one present, one real future. 

Ni-Fe hones in immediately on a person’s nature and doesn’t let go. You see Naruto and Luffy time and time again see the best in people. They don’t stop to entertain alternative possibilities that Ne Hero’s “what if” does. The perspective itself can change (Naruto shifts each time he comes to understand his antagonist), but only one is active at a time. Luffy knew right away Nami would be his navigator and didn’t care about what happened in the past, because why would Si Demon? Naruto instantly deemed Kabuto a good guy and doesn’t entertain possible explanations for why two Madaras seem to appear, rather focusing like a laser on what needs to be done. Luffy’s instincts for people are so well-known that more examples need not be cited. 

Fi Critic doesn’t show as *often* given the energy of optimistic shonen protagonists, but when they do, they show strongly. Naruto feels like his entire life is a worthless failure if he can’t bring Sasuke back because he made a once-in-a-lifetime promise to Sakura, and Si Demon will never let him forget it. This weighs on him so heavily that he sets aside his childhood dream for it. Luffy’s Fi Critic showed strongly when he lost his whole crew and his brother.

It’s actually hardest to type people who share yours. I thought Itachi was INTP because his childhood monologue of how to understand the world felt so relatable."

Many INTPs may be 5s, sure, being controlled by insecurities over being useless and therefore aspiring to seek mastery. However, when I consider what fears I might have lying on my deathbed, I don’t imagine myself worrying about the skills and knowledge I missed out on or having been useless. Rather, I am more afraid of having missed key experiences. 

In addition, 5 and 7 are closely related, as 5 is 7’s integration, and 7 is 5’s disintegration. So both have traces of each other.

The ENTJ Ego is of the Structure Interaction Style, which is your lead-from-the-front battle commander. However, ENTJs also have ISFP Subconscious and INTP Unconscious, which are both Background Interaction Style (most likely to blend in or lurk in the shadows). This makes ENTJs a “double-Background” type despite the Structure Ego. 

So contrary to how people stereotype ENTJs, they can actually be *very* prone to hermitting away and playing video games all day (sometimes). In fact, many ENTJs harbor a secret fantasy of one day locking themselves away to write poetry or create their artistic magnum opus in another form.

Conversely, the INTP Ego also has ENTJ Unconscious.

Most people spend most of their time in their Ego, but when we encounter stressful or difficult situations we can't overcome normally, we can cognitively transition into a different ""side"" of our mind. This is why colloquially, it's commonly agreed that people noticeably ""change personality"" or ""go into a different mode"" sometimes in response to certain challenges. ENTJ Ego has two introverted sides (ISFP Subconscious and INTP Unconscious) in which ENTJs can be in when they retreat into the background and hermit away sometimes.

Supposedly we cover each others’ cognitive blindspots. Do you have any examples of this - working together strategically to develop a solution that is superior to what either individual would have formulated?"

entj,fg3ixka,t3_ew9hdf,1580482641.0,"It's not supposed to be about anecdotal combinations of traits. There's a systematic and symmetric theory called ""cognitive synchronicity"" that explains how cognitive functions interface with each other in different people, with ENTJs providing perfect synergy for INTPs. I believe all these positive experiences people account are illustrations of this mechanism.

In addition to what’s been shared, I’d recommend calling National Runaway Safeline, a 24/7 youth homeless & crisis hotline, at 1-800-RUNAWAY. There’s also an online chat if you prefer that. 

Full disclosure - I volunteer at NRS, although this post is not made on my own, not their, behalf."
