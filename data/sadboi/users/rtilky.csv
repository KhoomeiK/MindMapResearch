TooAfraidToAsk,fr0hwjm,t3_glppb7,1589796269.0,"Not weird at all! I got in a pretty bad (but luckily no injuries) crash involving a rollover and a tree, and it was quite traumatic. For weeks I would have constant panic attacks anytime anything with wheels went near me (bikes, skateboards, etc.) which was quite difficult being in college and all. Luckily I somehow was okay with myself driving, but nobody else. I wasn't even comfortable being in my parent's car. This presented a huge problem, since I needed to take a bus from my college's parking lot to the academic buildings every day. I couldn't shake the absolute terror that I felt every time for years. Luckily I'm fine now.

In summary, yes it's normal, but hopefully with time the trauma will subside"

All the caffeine in the world didn't do me any good, coffee might have well just been water.  So, there i am, basically a zombie from zero sleep all week and the mental exhaustion from it all, walking into my final exam, knowing in advance that I was not prepared AT ALL.  I gave a quick scan through the exam and to my pleasant surprise saw that it was actually pretty easy.

And then the FU happened.  My body decided at that exact moment that it had enough of this grad school bullshit, and basically just gave up.  I kept falling asleep for 5-10 minutes at a time, waking up for a couple minutes and trying to complete at least a little bit of the problem before I inevitably fell asleep again. This happened over and over for the duration of the exam, all  while I knew that if I had even an ounce of mental energy I could do well on the exam.

TooAfraidToAsk,fjznwaa,t3_ffgeog,1583724341.0,"I think people use this word too loosely. Depression can be caused by negative factors, sure, but it isn't as situational as people make it out to be.  Feeling negative emotions as a result of external factors (financial concerns, family issues, loss, etc.) is pretty normal for adulthood.  I'm not downplaying this, is someone is struggling with any issue they should see a therapist if possible or at least open up to people who care about them.  Many people will need this at some point in their life (50% of Americans if I remember the statistic).  However true depression works a bit differently.  It can be brought on or made worse by external factors but the way I describe it to people is that everything can be going well but it's still a struggle to go through life.  You could be having the best time of your life with your best friend, and still be in agony under the surface. You may have the perfect life but still be so miserable that you beat yourself up for not being happy.  It doesn't matter what you do or what happens in your life, depression just drains any emotional depth from you until you can't feel anything at all."

As far as the programming questions are concerned, I can't really give you any specific details, but make sure you are solid with the basics (bit manipulation and memory), and especially with your knowledge of functions.  I believe he always specifies that the code will be a function of sorts.
