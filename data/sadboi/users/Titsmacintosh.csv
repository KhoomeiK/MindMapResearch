I know most cases aren't always this extreme, but I'm guessing we are all each carrying some pretty heavy struggles with fear and worry and finances and all the unknown but I think many of us parents are trying to get into the swing of the distance learning and appreciate the absolute hell out of how fast you teachers pulled together and got this all going, so thank you all.

Shorter men are where it's at. Especially if you are a shorter person like me, and Jesus, most women. 

 Why the fuck would I want someone that tall when I could be with someone shorter whose body fits perfectly against mine? 

I'll spend the rest of my life shouting from the roof tops- under 6 foot is where it's at! 

You're 5'6? Dude that's a perfect height for most women to fit against. It's so fucking hot. I cannot stress that enough! 

I promise there are women out there that think your height is absolutely dead sexy.
