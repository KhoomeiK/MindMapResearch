So he feels he has a sense of freedom by having a low maintenance job, whereas I am tethered to my career. I don‚Äôt have a job, I have a career marriage that I excel at and am vigilantly passionate about. He has no other addictions, he ha plenty of friends and all of them are standup people, who have integrity and are well-rounded and would be horrified if they knew that he is a PA. Absolutely horrified and they would never see it coming.  His health is fine, he‚Äôs close to his family. It‚Äôs the weirdest thing. No childhood trauma that he is aware of has initiated this. 

That‚Äôs where I struggle - the person he is without this disease is amazing. He‚Äôs wonderful on every level. Caring, genuine to his friends (just not me, as he‚Äôs wanking it to other girls), generous and giving, insightful and so ridiculously smart.

depression,ewiitpp,t3_cocukx,1565450167.0,"Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned in my depression:
People are afraid of people who struggle - it is usually not a conscious reaction. As a result, they unknowingly pull back. 

I have learned that my depression has prevented me from socially engaging others who I used to want to interact with. Many factors invoked: inability to fake it, inability to find the energy to keep up with conversation, lack of interest in event or conversation, self esteem issues preventing me from even wanting to be seen, and overall jealousy of those who have the ability to take care of themselves without effort and appear to be able to enjoy and engage life seamlessly. 
As a result of the above, I have isolated myself.
People gave up on asking me out, inviting me to things, and even checking in on me. 
I take some of the blame. Do wish people would be more vigilant in their efforts of friendship, and suddenly have a magic wand to see through my disinterest as an insult to them, but an injury to myself? Yes, but I can‚Äôt control others. 

So maybe if you put things into a different perspective and try to look from the outside looking in. It might help.

How do you move across the mindset though of wondering if he may be, just like before D Day with the former?
I worry I won‚Äôt trust anyone ever again and will always worry that they‚Äôre doing it quietly like my boyfriend now had been for two years. Says he isn‚Äôt going it but I know he hasn‚Äôt gotten help, so he‚Äôs obviously just gotten smarter about it. 
Do you end up snooping to validate your fears? That‚Äôs my feAr."

If he is uncomfortable he will move. 
Don‚Äôt even worry about it!"
loveafterporn,euv9sok,t1_eugz2i6,1564057572.0,"Fucking brilliant. 
And terrible."
progresspics,etebcd5,t3_caeah7,1562727833.0,"Awesome! What does IF stand for?

Did you have to work out a lot?"
loveafterporn,etbeaoh,t1_etauhlr,1562644233.0,This. This is the most realistic and ultimate goal.
sex,etbbom6,t1_etabhzf,1562642106.0,You go girl! I‚Äôm too ashamed to ride my bf due to my weight gain. It‚Äôs nice to see you mention how you‚Äôve changed. Gives some hope. Thank you for sharing.
loveafterporn,etbarmw,t3_caomzq,1562641398.0,"Please stop lying to her.
You don‚Äôt have to stop watching porn, but you have to stop lying to her.
You‚Äôre destroying her and she will never recover so long as you don‚Äôt recover.
She will make herself the enemy when it‚Äôs your addiction that really is the enemy.

You think you have it bad? Try walking in her shoes just for a day. You will keel over."
loveafterporn,etb9ton,t3_casanb,1562640697.0,"I am sorry this is happening to you. I feel for you, I‚Äôm in love with a PA  and I‚Äôve been so manipulated by him AND my own brain that the crossroads I thought I was at keeps moving away from me.

You must realize your codependency here. 
This is going to destroy you. You‚Äôre already ruined to a degree because of this becuas you don‚Äôt have the courage in yourself to get away. 
It‚Äôs in you - he took it. Get it back.
He‚Äôs not good for you because he‚Äôs making YOU not good for YOU. 

Sending love and light to you. Fight with all your might. You can meet people. You can do this.

I‚Äôm open to venting in direct message if you want. 
I‚Äôm just as miserable - sometimes it helps to share."
SuicideWatch,erv0q0x,t3_c34ko8,1561303134.0,"I know that you feel this was your fault. It‚Äôs important though to recognize that your girlfriend was all ready affected by depression prior to knowing you. Being that she was in the community and not under treatment, the risk was always there. It would have been there before you and after you, with you, or with someone else.
She was very sick, and you did the best you could, even you did your best in hindsight on your actions in your own sickness.
This is no one‚Äôs fault. 

You‚Äôre going to feel guilty for some time while you profess this, and more. Please make sure you are reaching out for professional help and let your loved ones know how you feel. 
It‚Äôs important to be known. Make these things known so you can receive the help and the love that you need to get through this. 

Peace to you, I‚Äôm so sorry."
loveafterporn,erp1z97,t3_c2i2yj,1561096327.0,Your post put me to tears. I‚Äôm going through the same situation. Thanks for sharing - I don‚Äôt feel so alone in this.
PornAddiction,erp1c46,t3_c2liu0,1561095617.0,"Remember that this is an addiction, and none of this is a reflection of you. You are caring for the one you love, and the one you love will relapse. You have to be able to ancitioate these fallbacks and relapses. Consider looking at his issue no differently than alcoholism or heroin addiction - addiction is addiction!
I am going through almost the EXACT SAME situation with my boyfriend of 3 years. Some days I question my sanity, and wonder why I am subjecting myself to this pain. 

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this, too."
