He’s incredibly intelligent but feels like work is sub par. He’d rather make art all day. So he feels he has a sense of freedom by having a low maintenance job, whereas I am tethered to my career. I don’t have a job, I have a career marriage that I excel at and am vigilantly passionate about. He has no other addictions, he ha plenty of friends and all of them are standup people, who have integrity and are well-rounded and would be horrified if they knew that he is a PA. Absolutely horrified and they would never see it coming.  His health is fine, he’s close to his family. It’s the weirdest thing. No childhood trauma that he is aware of has initiated this. 

That’s where I struggle - the person he is without this disease is amazing. He’s wonderful on every level. Caring, genuine to his friends (just not me, as he’s wanking it to other girls), generous and giving, insightful and so ridiculously smart. So it’s very hard to give up all of the things he is without this.

depression,ewiitpp,t3_cocukx,1565450167.0,"Here’s what I’ve learned in my depression:
People are afraid of people who struggle - it is usually not a conscious reaction. As a result, they unknowingly pull back. 

I have learned that my depression has prevented me from socially engaging others who I used to want to interact with. Many factors invoked: inability to fake it, inability to find the energy to keep up with conversation, lack of interest in event or conversation, self esteem issues preventing me from even wanting to be seen, and overall jealousy of those who have the ability to take care of themselves without effort and appear to be able to enjoy and engage life seamlessly. 
As a result of the above, I have isolated myself.
People gave up on asking me out, inviting me to things, and even checking in on me. 
I take some of the blame. Do wish people would be more vigilant in their efforts of friendship, and suddenly have a magic wand to see through my disinterest as an insult to them, but an injury to myself? Yes, but I can’t control others. 

So maybe if you put things into a different perspective and try to look from the outside looking in. It might help.
It doesn’t make it better, but it might help."

Did you have to work out a lot?"
loveafterporn,etbeaoh,t1_etauhlr,1562644233.0,This. This is the most realistic and ultimate goal.
sex,etbbom6,t1_etabhzf,1562642106.0,You go girl! I’m too ashamed to ride my bf due to my weight gain. It’s nice to see you mention how you’ve changed. Gives some hope. Thank you for sharing.
loveafterporn,etbarmw,t3_caomzq,1562641398.0,"Please stop lying to her.
You don’t have to stop watching porn, but you have to stop lying to her.
You’re destroying her and she will never recover so long as you don’t recover.
She will make herself the enemy when it’s your addiction that really is the enemy.

You think you have it bad? Try walking in her shoes just for a day. You will keel over."
loveafterporn,etb9ton,t3_casanb,1562640697.0,"I am sorry this is happening to you. I feel for you, I’m in love with a PA  and I’ve been so manipulated by him AND my own brain that the crossroads I thought I was at keeps moving away from me.

You must realize your codependency here. 
This is going to destroy you. You’re already ruined to a degree because of this becuas you don’t have the courage in yourself to get away. 
It’s in you - he took it. Get it back.
He’s not good for you because he’s making YOU not good for YOU. 

Sending love and light to you. Fight with all your might. You can meet people. You can do this.

I’m open to venting in direct message if you want. 
I’m just as miserable - sometimes it helps to share."
SuicideWatch,erv0q0x,t3_c34ko8,1561303134.0,"I know that you feel this was your fault. It’s important though to recognize that your girlfriend was all ready affected by depression prior to knowing you. Being that she was in the community and not under treatment, the risk was always there. It would have been there before you and after you, with you, or with someone else.
She was very sick, and you did the best you could, even you did your best in hindsight on your actions in your own sickness.
This is no one’s fault. 

You’re going to feel guilty for some time while you profess this, and more. Please make sure you are reaching out for professional help and let your loved ones know how you feel. 
It’s important to be known. Make these things known so you can receive the help and the love that you need to get through this. 

Peace to you, I’m so sorry."
loveafterporn,erp1z97,t3_c2i2yj,1561096327.0,Your post put me to tears. I’m going through the same situation. Thanks for sharing - I don’t feel so alone in this.
PornAddiction,erp1c46,t3_c2liu0,1561095617.0,"Remember that this is an addiction, and none of this is a reflection of you. You are caring for the one you love, and the one you love will relapse. You have to be able to ancitioate these fallbacks and relapses. Consider looking at his issue no differently than alcoholism or heroin addiction - addiction is addiction!
I am going through almost the EXACT SAME situation with my boyfriend of 3 years. Some days I question my sanity, and wonder why I am subjecting myself to this pain. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this, too."
