For what it's worth, my wife was the same way and therapy has been a godsend for us.  It's gotten her away from the mental abuse she put herself through, negative self talk, and all around anxeity she had about life.  A book is great for understanding, but nothing beats having a good therapist identify your needs and teach you the tools to address those needs.  Hope you find what you need."

AskReddit,f6y3cos,t3_dtp3h9,1573266421.0,"I'm going to assume that you mean that the Earth is a solid round mass and not filled with lava or any of that other inconvenient stuff.  I'm also going to assume that you're planning on geronimoing into a hole thats big enough that you dont anticipate that you will contact the sides.  Well also assume the Earth is relatively round.

So the acceleration due to gravity at a depth looks like this:
a=g (1- d/r) where; 
a = acceleration at depth 'd'
g = acceleration at the earth's surface (const)
d = depth
r = radius of the earth

So as you tend toward the middle of the Earth, 'd' will increase, 'r' will decrease and 'a' will tend toward zero.  So when you jump in, you would be moving at a pretty steady clip.  Your weight would drop as you tended toward the center (W=ma) but your momentum would be conserved less wind resistance.  

Sidebar: This gets really squirrelly because as the density of air increases so does the drag.  However, I say that with a lot of reservation because other characteristics of air (humidity, temp, etc) can cause the density of air to change.  Maybe someone else will know how air behaves at this depth.

If you want to assume no air resistance, you would yo-yo back and forth.  No yoting out into the milky way because your momentum would be conserved and you would have just enough to get back to the same height each time as that which you came from.

My best guess while considering air resistance is that your velocity (due to drastically increased wind resistance) and acceleration (due to the equation above) would drop dramatically as you tended towards the center.  Most of your momentum would be lost on the way down and you wouldn't go far past the center before you were pulled back in the same direction from which you came.  You would (I assume rapidly) settle in the center of gravity of the Earth and float as if you were out in deep space with nothing around because any remaining gravitational forces would cancel each other out."
