MorbidReality,fps4l7s,t1_fps2u27,1588867365.0,"I can see where you're coming from. But if you're brave, read [this article](https://unbelievable-facts.com/2016/12/hisashi-ouchi.html). Graphic images and unbelievable human suffering ahead. 

TL;DR: Hisashi Ouchi was exposed to over twice the fatal dose of radiation in an accident. He was kept alive for 83 days against his will. He was even resuscitated on the 59th day when his heart stopped three times. His skin slowly fell off of his body and he eventually passed due to multiple organ failure. 

There will always be cases where you cannot be saved. And there will always be cases where life would not be worth living after being saved. If we can euthanize dogs, we should be able to euthanize people. Of course some laws and regulations can be put in place to prevent unneeded euthanasia, but it should not be fully illegal for any reason, in my opinion. 

There was an amazingly fascinating documentary on YouTube and if you're interested I can try to find it again. I watched it years ago but it's the final days of an elderly woman who chose to die via euthanasia. She wasn't senile, but her body hurt all the time and she was just bored of living. She went on a trip with her friends (she had only 2 left) and finally passed. To me, at least, it was touching and meaningful and beautiful. 

I'm sorry I'm rambling. This is a topic I'm passionate about. How nice would it be to get a phone call and be like, ""Hey, your grandma has decided to pass away in 3 months. Take some time off of work and come see her."" As opposed to watching your grandma wither away in the hospital, become trapped in her own mind, forget your name, and then finally get the call that she's taking her last breaths. What if you didn't make it there to see her? Would it even matter? She was gone months or years ago. Only now is her body catching up.

Idk man. Euthanasia and a generally more accepting view of death can be a beautiful thing. It's inevitable, we might as well make it comfortable, pleasant even."

CPTSD,fpcydmt,t3_gckt3l,1588515803.0,"That was one of the many reasons I loved Forrest Gump too. And I had a very VERY close connection with Pink Floyd The Wall. In the movie, it depicts a lot of domestic violence, and as a child I was too young to be watching that but what's the point when I was already seeing that shit in real life? It felt therapeutic to me to see my life depicted on a screen, instead of you know... other children's shows. You know how kids will watch a movie over and over and over and over again? The Wall was my movie. A fucking huge gaping hole was ripped in my chest when I learned my mom threw away my VHS copy of it. It was MY copy. I've since gotten another, but it's not the same. It's not the same block of plastic and tape that helped me cope.

Hardly related, but as I grew older I slowly and slowly made the connections to World War II and the true meaning of the songs and images on screen. Of course I had no clue what that meant as a child. But it solidified my love for that movie. It helped me feel better as a kid, and my understanding about it grew as I did."
