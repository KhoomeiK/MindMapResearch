To be transparent her sex life will be the hardest part of fertility because intercourse is often painful. Having surgery for it was the best decision I ever made. Changed my life for the better. I’m no longer anemic, intercourse can’t be wild but at least I can have sex now, I no longer bleed thru my pants overnight.  Tell her to slow down.  Google is not a fortune teller of what’s to come."
