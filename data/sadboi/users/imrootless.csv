mentalillness,fo1rzrc,t3_g56jf2,1587440132.0,They’ve actually discovered that the root cause of mental illness doesn’t source from imbalances in neurotransmitters but actually from imbalances in brainwaves. If I were you maybe do some research on neurofeedback treatment. It doesn’t have negative side effects and it actually heals your brain. I’m starting my first sessions this week!

You might think that it’s second nature to know to check up on friends because you struggle with mental illness and might need that, but to them they might have no clue they’re doing anything wrong. They probably don’t not care, they could just not realize that they’re not doing something you want them to be doing. I don’t know the exact case that you’re dealing with but they can’t read your mind you know?"

AmItheAsshole,fcxc9zk,t3_ejf45b,1578058978.0,"NTA and you’re friend sounds like an idiot.

Everyone no matter their weight has the right to hate themselves lmao. Just because you’re thin doesn’t mean that automatically comes with confidence, especially considering you have body dysmorphia. I understand how that is, and with that diagnosis it can feel impossible to love yourself no matter how you look. The concept of “thin privilege” is complete and utter bullshit. Also, she literally just finished talking about how she loves herself. How is it insulting to her that you don’t? If she had just talked to you about hating herself because she’s fat, and you responded by saying you also hate yourself and think your body is ugly, you might be an asshole. That would be insulting, but that is not what happened. Your friend sounds excessively sensitive. I’m sorry they said that."

AmItheAsshole,fcxblzk,t3_ejf7ee,1578058397.0,"NAH

I don’t think your friend isn’t listening to your advice. I’m sure she’s listening. Her family is probably just too crazy to actually reason with and she’s dealing with something extremely difficult. She is not an asshole for what she is doing. 
You also would not be an asshole for putting a bit of a boundary up. If it’s taking a toll on you, you have every right to back off. You’re not a licensed therapist. You cannot help others to the point of it being at your own expense. 
That being said, be wary of how you build this boundary. If you say kindly that you need to be involved a bit less for your own sake, you wouldn’t be an asshole. If you suddenly dropped the help entirely and told your friend not to go to you for advice about it from here on out, you would be an asshole. Not for doing it, but for doing it that way. Slowly back off and put the responsibility back onto your friend over time. She obviously needs you, and it would hurt her to lose you too quickly. You are definitely not the asshole, and she isn’t either. Her family might be, but the situation here specifically involves you two."
AmItheAsshole,fcxb65d,t1_fcxasf2,1578058008.0,"Most of your family have taken your mums side????? Are they nuts?????? I’m sorry about them lol. I bet you if your sister sides with your mom it’s only because she wanted her trip to Amsterdam. You’re taking your mother to Prague because her asshole husband cancelled to be “fair”, as if your trip was paid for entirely by him. Doesn’t make sense. Even if it is petty, it is very generous and he’s a dick. You’re NTA here lmao"
AmItheAsshole,fcxamtx,t3_ejf7f7,1578057514.0,"NTA

It’s glaringly obvious that you’re not an asshole for taking your mother on an expensive trip that her husband decided to cut her out of. If you knew deep down it would annoy her husband, who freaking cares? He’s the one who unreasonably cancelled a trip on your mother that she really wanted to go on. He sounds likes he’s a massive dick and would deserve annoyance 100 times over. There is no way you could be an asshole in this situation. You’ve shown yourself to be exceedingly generous two times in this post. I’m sorry OP, but this has to be a validation post.

EDIT: Not validation."
AmItheAsshole,fcx9yhh,t1_fcx2br8,1578056867.0,"I disagree. It involves some sort of business transaction but it still involves a favor for family. The fact that it is family still changes the situation (according to social expectations, which I believe apply in this situation). Babysitting for family while being paid is still a favor for them, or at least I would consider it to be. How OP treated the situation like it wasn’t family is what makes them seem like an asshole. 
I’m not disagreeing that the cousins were also being assholes though. 

Again, I’m basing this view off of how a person’s behavior is perceived in real life. Social expectations don’t follow total logic sometimes, but they’re still ingrained in our society. You can argue why these expectations don’t make sense and be right. Regardless, this does not change the fact that certain behavior according to our culture would make you an asshole in that situation. In real life, emotions and relationships effect how people should behave in different interactions. The different relationships warrant different behaviors. I think the behavior in this situation would make both sides assholes."
AmItheAsshole,fcwtxfd,t1_fcwt5yn,1578037469.0,"I think I actually want to take back some of what I said lol. 

I based my original comment more on how this is one of those situations that is very different in real life than on Reddit, but I don’t think I was very clear. We can understand here why OP did what they did with explanations.

I think that even though OP’s cousins were assholes from the start, I believe OP’s response also made her an asshole.

I’m going to take back some of what I said specifically about the price. I think what makes it seem bad to me is because this wasn’t a flat out business interaction. OP’s family asked for a favor. Don’t forget that this is family, and family does favors for each other. It’s not required, but in real life, it’s generally expected and sometimes (for more reasonable requests) you’d be an asshole for not doing that favor. Even though it’s not your job to complete that favor, you’d probably seem like an asshole if you didn’t. That’s just life unfortunately. 

In this situation, OP was asked an outrageous favor and said no. Then the family said they’d pay, and OP treated this situation like a business interaction. You aren’t debating on your salary with an employer, you’re talking to family that asked for a (somewhat crazy) favor. I think in a situation like this OP should have just said no a second time. Yes I understand the favor was not reasonable, but I think as to not seem like an ass OP should have said no consistently, rather than trying to almost barter with family over their pay. This is not the same as a second job asking you to abandon your first job. This is a favor being asked with some money offered.  Also, don’t forget that OP was not being asked to leave work. They were ahead of the game with work and were planning to work ahead further. The way OP reacted seemed cold, and even though we understand their reasoning perfectly well here on reddit, it is not the same in real life. This is one of those situations where social expectations are important to why OP seemed like an asshole, despite the reasoning making sense. 

I’m going to add some of this to my original comment."
AmItheAsshole,fcwseix,t1_fcwqxn6,1578035707.0,"I agree that with the explanation she gave, everything makes sense. I understand that it’s not her normal job and because she was planning on making more money during the time she was asked to babysit, it makes sense to ask more. I agree that OP’s cousins are assholes for their request. I think OP’s cousins are entitled for expecting her to agree to babysit. I get all of that. 

What I was trying to do in my comment was give an opinion that I believe is what most people probably think in real life. Not that we aren’t real people with real opinions, but in person I was explaining that what OP did made them seem like an asshole. I do think the cousins should have realized they were fat entitled pricks and should have stopped asking after the initial no. I DEFINITELY think they are assholes too. It does not sound to me, though, that the cousins berated OP for an answer. They did kind of set up for an asshole response though. The cousins probably should have expected OP to answer with a high price after OP said no because of their other work.

I personally think OP was justified, but I think that outside of an extensive analysis on reddit, it would be concluded that OP is an asshole. Unfortunately in real life, you can’t explain your behavior in great detail. Because you can’t do that, you have to be aware of what you’re doing and if what you’re doing can only be justified by a long explanation. 

I think OP justifiably said something assholey, but it was still assholey. 

And I think the normal rate does apply to this large of a gap even with the timing and 3 kids. I personally think it’s unreasonable enough that the timing and kids doesn’t change anything. Agree to disagree"
AmItheAsshole,fcwqb9i,t1_fcwpgo7,1578033464.0,"I think quibbling over the rate is very important. I think the rate is exactly what makes OP an asshole and is worth discussing. $35 is even in the title, and is clearly an important part of the discussion. It’s what makes OP’s request absurd, and despite the situation, it’s still absurd. 

I agree that they asked and got an answer, and if they didn’t like it then too bad. I get that fully. I still think asking for $35 in itself makes you an asshole. I think it’s important what other people think is reasonable and what the current average rate is because there is such a large difference between that and $35. If we were arguing about $17 vs $15 it would be ridiculous, but I don’t think it is in this situation. The difference between what’s normal and what OP asked for is what makes OP seem entitled."
AmItheAsshole,fcwpyvd,t1_fcvxoyt,1578033113.0,"I think it’s common sense to know that $35 is overcharging to babysit, despite there being 3 kids. I believe $35 is so high of a price to ask for babysitting that anyone would know it would be rejected. Maybe adding $20 to the regular $15 an hour doesn’t look crazy to you, but think about how much $35/hr would add up to after 3 says. I’m not being cruel here, I’m being perfectly reasonable. 

Again, even if OP did not know that $35 was overcharging, they would still come across as an asshole. That means they genuinely thought their cousins would agree that they are worth $35 an hour. It sounds like genuine entitlement. 

(In my original comment I wrote that I understand what OP was saying. I’m not ignoring their argument, I think it makes sense. I still think they’re an asshole, though.)"
AmItheAsshole,fcwp6ta,t1_fcw5cnl,1578032337.0,"OP said they had plans to do freelance work, and right after saying that was offered to be paid. They could have still said no. They didn’t need to say that the price would need to be near their freelance rate, because obviously that would warrant the cousin to ask what it would be. The cousin didn’t insist on a price, they asked for a price after OP said there indeed was a price. I think it makes OP an asshole for asking for a price as outrageous as $35 rather than saying no despite the questions. $35 is high enough that there’s no way OP thought it was an ask that would be agreed to. And even if OP genuinely thought $35 could be agreed to, I think that’s still being an asshole. That’s assuming the cousins agree that they’re valuable enough to be paid $35 an hour for babysitting. 

 I think that the cousin felt everything I explained in my comment, and that’s why they had the outburst. I agree with what they said in the outburst and think it should’ve been expected after what OP asked for. Though, it is an asshole move to ask for someone to babysit for 3 whole days over the holidays just because you want to hang out with your buddies.

I’m going to edit my comment, I think ESH fits better."
AmItheAsshole,fcwo6bw,t1_fcw8r8a,1578031340.0,"Like I said, I myself don’t think OP is the asshole. I understand the reasoning and it makes sense to me. I still think though that despite everything you said, asking for $35/hr would still make someone seem like an asshole. 15 to 35 is still a huge jump despite the holidays or ages. $20 would be a reasonable raise from $15 for the fact that it’s over the holidays. Plus, considering it’s for 3 days, $20 an hour will make you a TON of money. Also, I don’t think that a 16 year old and a 24 year old are that different in babysitting expertise. It’s the same job and the same work. Considering the parents did act like idiots, maybe it would make more sense to say ESH."
AmItheAsshole,fcvec0j,t3_eizcvf,1578000319.0,"EDIT: ESH

EDIT: I didn’t get my point across. Rewrote completely 

I think your reasoning makes sense. They were asking you to babysit rather than work. You would have made more money working. They asked how much it would cost for you to babysit instead of work, and you told them. Why would you waste your time getting paid 1/4 of you would have otherwise? I get that. 

Unfortunately, this is one of those situations that is very different in real life than on Reddit because we can understand here why OP did what they did with explanations. 

I think what makes OP seem like an asshole to me is because this wasn’t a flat out business interaction. OP’s family asked for a favor.
