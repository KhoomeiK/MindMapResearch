I kicked and screamed for 2 years that I was fine and the Drs were full of it. If I didn't believe it, why would I waste my time trying to convince someone else?
About a week after my discharge, (Honorable üòÅ)I had my first flashback. My own personal active shooter drill. 
It's been brutal but defusing the need for people to 'believe' me made a huge difference. God bless ü§ó"

kratom,f53xoip,t1_f505qrm,1571966108.0,"That's how I understand it now. At first I thought they meant 2 versions of 1 effect with the smaller dose being more profound. 
I started using kratom about a year ago for mood/energy boost and it's been a life saver. But a couple of times I drove right past the exit for ""happy/productive"" and wound up in ""drowsy/sedated"".
For the most part I enjoy the variations and dialing in my ideal dosage. Hell, my worst Kratom experience wasn't half as bad as a typical day on pharmaceuticals."

mentalhealth,f1wn575,t3_davc6s,1569786968.0,"Hi, I'm  a 40 something recovering addict with ADHD and bipolar disorder that weren't diagnosed until a few years ago. I consider myself somewhat qualified having lived a few decades with these conditions untreated.

If the diagnoses are correct, they are unfortunate but not life threatening. Your son will be fine while you make arrangements for a second opinion from a professional of your choosing. 

Ultimately, due diligence takes time. I have seen what stimulants can do to people of any age who don't actually need them. If you forego the second opinion, I fear it will haunt you. 

Good luck and God bless."
ptsd,f1wgf8o,t3_davzhx,1569784433.0,"I hear ya and know how tough it is. Try to focus on what isn't broken, what doesn't  suck. If you can't do anything about a circumstance, file it in a temporary mental folder and move on to something else. 

I spent years dwelling on things that couldn't be changed. Our thoughts can be like quicksand.

Have you checked local buy/sell sites to see if anyone has an old fridge their trying to get rid of? I see at least one or two in my area frequently for free.

As far as  the low funds go, maybe you could gather up some things collecting dust and list them in an online marketplace. We all have stuff lying around we haven't used or don't really need. Sure it might only be a few bucks but the distraction would be good for you.

Good luck and God bless."

kratom,f1s3m8u,t3_dajhyv,1569723729.0,"That's awesome. I had the same experience, more or less. It's been 7 years now living with c-PTSD, major depression and half a dozen other mental maladies. I tried Kratom in the beginning but now believe what I  actually got was bunk. About a year ago, out of severe desperation I tried again. This time from a vendor with an excellent reputation. It was amazing. The most significant relief was from suicidal ideation and belligerent self talk. 
After a dozen pharmaceutical cocktails and 36 hours of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation failed spectacularly, good ol' Ma Nature saved the day. And my life.
I keep my prescriptions on hand just in case but haven't missed them.
Take care."

The problem is that emotions and logic are like Siamese twins. They can't be separated and frequently want to go in different directions.

Since your gf went astray in the past, she can't be certain you won't. However jealous/suspicious she would have been if she hadn't cheated is now multiplied.

I wish you both the best."

Now kids are responding with firearms. Being expelled was actually a great thing for me so I guess they ultimately failed the students of today.

AskReddit,f1dyizb,t1_f1dkcc2,1569405874.0,"Oh, no worries! The GI Bill is the military's tuition assistance program. The first problem is you have to come up with the tuition first and once you're in school, they reimburse you. The other problem is you only have 10 years to use it or it expires.  There's a post 9/11 GI Bill but I don't know much about it.

The military is basically broken into 2 groups, enlisted and officers. Enlisted are the ones who get shit done. Officers are the ones who tell enlisted what shit needs to get done and take all the credit.üòâ

OCS or Officer Candidate School is like boot camp 2.0. Enlisted troops who want to become officers have to complete another boot camp type training. Any enlisted can apply for it but usually need to have a college degree. 

I hope that makes a little more sense. I didn't know the first thing about it when I joined and remember clearly how foreign it all sounds."
AskReddit,f1dk12g,t3_d8y0v1,1569386920.0,"I just have to say about 80% of enlisted joined because college wasn't an option.
I refused to pay 100 grand for a 20 thousand dollar education. So, I joined the Marine Corps. 
The free college is a joke. I was 3 credits away from my associates when my GI Bill ran out. Then I re-enlisted in the Army National Guard for 6 years. It never failed, every semester overlapped with some Guard obligation.
I don't regret a minute of it but would recommend you get as much college as you can first. Then if you decide to enlist, go to officer candidate school.
Best of luck to you!"

CPTSD,f1br6b8,t3_d8on6n,1569341119.0,"In my experience,  the short answer is yes. It got worse before it got better. I kicked and screamed, swore up and down I didn't have c-PTSD, PTSD  or anything else for 2 years after my diagnosis. Then I had the first or many personal 'active shooter drills'. Aka dissociative flashbacks. That's what drove me to seek treatment. Unfortunately, my only resource was the VA which could very well be why it got worse. 
Long story short, keep your therapist informed of any concerns you have. Don't expect meds to cure it. Most of all, don't let your Dr. make you feel like a nuisance. 
Also, check out the DBSA (Depression Bipolar Support  Alliance), they saved my life. It's a free, weekly, peer-led support group. Hopefully there's one close to you.
Remember, it's not your fault. Best of luck to you."

ptsd,f1adp11,t1_f19tsvj,1569291274.0,There's a big difference between 'alone' and 'lonely'. It was probably unintentional but I don't believe someone can be content and lonely at the same time.
AskReddit,f14k4a2,t3_d4qe8x,1569176404.0,"**Forgive yourself**. It sounds simple enough but took me seven years to realize. Took another short while to accomplish. Once I did, a lot of the negative self talk and self-loathing ceased. It allowed me to stop reliving everything that led me to the pit of despair. I'm not out of the pit yet but can now focus on my future. A future I was certain didn't exist.

The best (and most frustrating) part is, it didn't require a doctor or a prescription and didn't cost a dime.  I believe the biggest obstacle is convincing the person it's *not* their fault. Blame is counterproductive, regardless."
