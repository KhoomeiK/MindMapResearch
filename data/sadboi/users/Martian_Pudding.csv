I feel like people in general tend to overestimate how similar people of the same gender are to them and how different people who aren't the same gender are. Just because there are average differences between men and women doesn't mean an individual woman will have more in common with you than an individual man.

Both hot and cold are very unpleasant over a certain threshold, and you probably have more experience with either extreme heat or extreme cold. For example if an Australian says they prefer cold and a Canadian says they prefer heat they are probably talking about wildly different things as 'hot' and 'cold'. I'm Dutch and I'd say I prefer heat, but the hottest my country gets is about 30 C and any hotter I associate with summer holidays and chilling at a pool, while in winter snow is pretty common here and it sucks a lot more when you're not just there to play in it. Snow isn't fun when you need to get somewhere and you're freezing and wet and it's not pretty because cars are driving in the streets and everything is just gray mush.
This isn't my argument to say that heat is better, the truth is that a moderate amount of hot or cold is better than an extreme amount, and experiencing more extreme amounts is also a wildly different experience if it's occasional (and elective) or daily life."

I cry a lot more easily that my SO, and earlier in our relationship he found it hard to know what to do when I cried because he figured that if I cried I must be just as sad as he was when he cried, which is only in the most extreme of situations, so I had to be extremely upset. But in reality I just cry easily when I'm frustrated or nervous and that doesn't mean I'm way more upset about those things than he is, it just means I cry more easily and that's all.

Knowing that someone is gifted can also help predict/ explain the kind of problems they are likely to have, and in my personal subjective experience gifted people tend to think in similar ways.

unpopularopinion,fq5bpjx,t3_ggshr6,1589099328.0,I think asking for money makes sense as a child or teenager but when adults with jobs ask eachother for money you might as well not get anyone anything because the net outcome would be the same. If I give you 50 bucks for your birthday and then you give me 50 bucks for mine what is the point?

AMA,fq5avtg,t1_fq34721,1589098474.0,I'm just wondering what is illegal about it? I can see many ways that could go wrong but the initial act of pretending to me married to several people doesn't seem inherently immoral or harmful to me.

If his dad really didn't use to do that (or he just doesn't remember) he might really not have thought he was supposed to, and then might have felt put on the spot for not having prepared something thebday before and feeling defensive about it. That is giving him quite a large benefit of the doubt though."
AskReddit,fq35oil,t3_gg6iqu,1589063249.0,"We were both in this Facebook group about Cosplay and ended up joining the same group to do a group act at a con. We started talking I think probably mostly about traveling together to go to group meetings and about making the costumes and practice, and we never stopped talking after we did the act (we won the competition btw). We only meet like a couple of times a year but we chat literally every day for like five years now."
