Has anyone met with him recently? Has he had any actual therapy with a long term therapist, not just someone at the school who’s job it is is to figure out why a kid won’t do his schoolwork?

I’m not trying to downplay the providers that he’s been seen by thus far, but a doctor looking to diagnose for medication is looking to do just that, diagnose for medication. A school social worker is looking for issues regarding home life and schoolwork.

I’d try getting the kid in with a legitimate psychologist, and long term, not just one and done “Heres an hour meeting, nah he’s good.”

Really, Dad and Mom should be doing this. Not you. The fact that Dad has taken a hands off approach with such a clearly disturbed child is alarming and absolutely not “good Dad” material as you’re touting him to be, unfortunately.

Additionally, going through his phone, here’s my advice on that; just stop. One of two things with that, either 1. He’s into kinks you’re just not, which **is perfectly ok and healthy** or 2. He’s into illegal things in which case you should be contacting the proper authorities. What “should never be said in someone’s lifetime” could be normal in my life/sex life but could be absolutely disgusting to you. Does that make sense? So unless it’s flat out illegal, he’s an adolescent coming into his own and discovering sexuality.

Again, if it’s something that’s **that** alarming, all the more reason to get him in with a psychologist who can correctly and accurately assess his needs.

This kid sounds incredibly lost and the fact that Mom and Dad have both gone “Eh, fuck it” should be your reason for getting out of dodge, **not** the kid himself.

It’s been over 2 years that my partner has been asking for literally just a signature. She’s gotten the house, the cars, everything. He wants just a signature.

Once the courts open back up, we’ll be taking her to court for that signature and likely getting seen in front of that judge. 

His attorney said the judges MO is to start with a $500 per month fine/contempt charge for every month the papers aren’t signed (assuming the judge feels the person is being wholly disagreeable). That judge is also a big one for making things fair, given the fact we’re a split property state and the property clearly wasn’t split.

Worst case he gets the signature and we walk. Best case she winds up owing him a hefty sum to buy him out, of sorts.

Now she’s refusing to sign divorce papers because she’s convinced we’re going to run off and get married. The money was available for custody or divorce, and given SS10’s health and welfare, custody came first. HCBM earned herself a child abuse finding and was stripped of her parental rights, so I’m not mad at all. Now she’s sitting on the divorce like a piece of paper means anything at all.

1. I’m not getting married again. Even if he asked, my answer would be “Thanks for the beautiful ring, but no.”

2. It would be more legal trouble for **us** to split right now than it was for me and my first husband to get divorced.

My concern is if I sit back and let shit slide, SS10 is going to turn out to be a little shit while the other 3 are going to get the hammer of justice brought down upon them (because they do).

Another piece of advice, most attorney's will do a free consultation. Definitely look around. Do a few. Research on Avvo. Get quotes for their retainers, and ask if they do monthly payment plans for the additional charges that will likely accrue. From there, **save up**.

Custody,fp3jbey,t1_fp3i2vv,1588280295.0,"Aaaaah gotcha. Sorry, I misunderstood. I thought the case directly involved your kids.

If I were in your situation then, I'd call CPS. If they go every other weekend, I'd call on like the Monday before they go to ensure CPS has enough time to set up a caseworker to go out when they're there. Whenever they go back for visitation, that is.

Once that case is opened, I'd contact an attorney to refile for a change in custody arrangements. An active, valid CPS case is usually a golden seal in regards to custody modifications. He'd have little to no leg to stand on, especially given his background.

I'm never one to say TAKE THE KIDS FROM THE OTHER PARENT but it sounds like his behavior and environment need to change drastically before it's healthy for the kids.

The other issue to look at is if you **know** your kids are going into a potentially unsafe environment (which you do, you're posting about it on Reddit), don't sit on this. You can be held just a liable by CPS as he can, but you may be found with neglect vs whatever they find for him. To the best of my knowledge, that doesn't happen often, but I know it *does* happen. I'm always one to say call if you even *suspect* something is shitty. They'll tell you if they can investigate. And truthfully, if they go out and find nothing, fine. But as a mom, I know I'd rather they go out and find nothing, or even come to **my** home and find nothing, than miss going somewhere and have something shitty happen, ya know?"

Likewise, when we went to court for custody, the judge contacted CPS due to HCBM's actions against my partner's son, and my partner was contacted and made aware she was being investigated even though he wasn't directly involved, his son was.

You should be involved, unless your ex is giving them the wrong information, I'm assuming?

We literally have primary physical and sole legal. I'm raising the kid like one of my own because he is one of my own.

People like your SO baffle me. How do you go into a serious relationship involving children (whether they're yours or your partners) and play the mine vs your game?

By making you feel like you have to justify your frustrations, he's subtly pointing out that you're not her parent. He's not allowing you to treat her like your own.

Custody battles with exes can get hellacious, especially if the ex is nutty. There are so many factors and so many issues at stake, a lot of men (in my personal life experience) do tend to go the road single. One of my closest friends once expressed to me that it was easier to deal with one woman in his ear constantly than to deal with his ex AND a new girlfriend bitching ABOUT the ex. 

&#x200B;

Of course, I'm not saying you'd do that at all, but that could be a bit of his apprehension, whether it's conscious or subconsciously being thought. Letting you go means there's one less person to deal with during an intensely stressful time, ya know? Pressuring him just adds the stress he's likely trying to avoid. 

My partner has a vindictive, bitter ass hag of an ex. So far, she's cost us over $25,000 on custody court fees *alone,*  and his attorney is quite reasonable with her fees. That's not including the divorce he's been trying to go through over the last 4 years. I know yours doesn't have a divorce, but let that sink in.

$25,000. 

And he has 1 kid we went to court for. 1 kid. He got primary physical and **sole legal**, which is **unheard of** in our state. But it was a battle, and it cost us dearly. And now it's costing us the ability to purchase a house for our family.

Pennsylvania,fobn5ik,t3_fwt0lq,1587661538.0,"**QUESTION REGARDING $600 -** 

This issue is a big wonky. We had to call into the UC office to clear this up. My partner filed 3/20, the day he was laid off. We filed an initial claim, because that's what we thought it was. We waited and waited, and finally called the UC office and got through around 4/16.

He had opened a claim back in November from a previous employer, but never filed a biweekly claim because he was hired elsewhere literally a few days after. He never needed the unemployment. So for this, he shouldn't have filed a ""new claim"", these first few COVID claims would be on the tail end of this old claim from November, then he needed to file a new claim beginning the week of 4/20 (my dates may be off, we've made the calls and he's been squared away at this point).

My partner was very clear with the UC CS person that this layoff on 3/20 was due to COVID, not due to the issue from November. She said yes, she understood. He is eligible for the $600, and no waiting week. Ok, great.

So, he's been unemployed since 3/20, and we've gotten 4 weeks work of PA UC payments.  That is correct. We just got those payments on 4/20 and 4/22. We have not yet seen the $600 payments, but as I understand it, he will be eligible for 3 of them thus far (week ending 4/4, week ending 4/11, week ending 4/18 and continuing until the end date)?

So at this point we're just waiting on the $1800 in the federal UC he's due, which comes separately, yes? Does that sound correct? Once he receives his PIN and can log in online, is there a way to check the status of that, or no?

What type of waiting timeline has everyone seen for these payments? I've seen a few comments where people are saying if they get their PA UC payments on Monday, they're seeing the $600 on Tuesday or Wednesday...of the same week? Of the next week? What about those who have had back pay get reimbursed?"

There was a question about potential unemployment when they went to conciliation, to begin with, and the conciliator (in our state) was pretty clear since she's horrifically underemployed, to begin with, they're not likely to grant her much leniency if she ever becomes unemployed.

Since this is a global pandemic, I'm not sure if she'll be granted leniency or not, if she'll even request any. 

My guess would be since nothing is really moving (at least in our area) unless it's an *absolute* emergency, you can likely file a modification order or whatever they're called, and it'll likely get backdated and they'll likely hold the funds for now, but they'll probably continue to take them out if they're automatically withdrawn where you're located.

The physical hair on your head that you color will obviously never be the same because it will be chemically changed. Coloring your hair doesn’t change your genetics, though. As your hair grows back in, it will grow in the same as it always has. The only thing that can change that is genetics, some medications, and diet.

As for the “mousy” comment, I’m not sure what her intention was behind it, but yeah, that’s not a polite thing to say to someone. My natural color is a 6/7A, if you’re familiar with hair color at all. Mousy indeed. It is what it is, ya know? It’s beautiful. It’s just a color. Fuck that noise.

If you want to color it for *you*, go hard girl. Get you some. But make sure you do it for *you*. 

I color my hair religiously, and I absolutely love it. I’ve had black hair for years, with a pop highlight off to the one side for when I get bored (because let’s be real, lifting black is a *pain*).

I say go for it. If you want to do it because *you* want to do it, do it. If you want to do it because some butthole said something nasty? Sit on it for a few days. Your hair will be beautiful either way 🖤"
