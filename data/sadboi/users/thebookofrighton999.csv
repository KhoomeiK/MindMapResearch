EDAnonymous,fbsq8xo,t1_fbsgjhr,1577058712.0,"Food deprivation changes the way our bodies metabolize nutrients. Insulin is a hormone that breaks down sugar from carbs. When ya don’t eat carbs, insulin slows. Without carbs, the body breaks down carbs, fats, etc. This change depletes electrolyte stores. When we start eating again there’s a shift from fat metabolism back to carbs. So your insulin goes up. Generally, your electrolytes are needed to convert glucose to energy.

When I was in treatment 15 ish years ago I was sneaking carbs because they start you on a no carb diet. I got into the muffin stash and promptly had a heart attack."

I am not afraid to die. I’m exhausted and in pain. 26 years of mind games and almost dying every year has hardened me. Now that I’m past the point of no return, I’m relieved.

I’m not a good person to answer the point of living question. I’m sure, from what I understand of you- you’re unsure too.

Yes it seems we are in the same boat! I don’t walk though, but I do sit and play guitar on good days. I was a professional musician for a long time.

I may be biased, but I encourage everyone to take care of their health first. Without you, there are no “next steps”.  I’ve lived this truth. As far as love- that’s bullshit. You have to take care of yourself before anyone else, even if you really love others. Gotta be selfish.
