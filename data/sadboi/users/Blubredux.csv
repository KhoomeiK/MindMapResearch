It was supposed to be the only sleep aid rated by the FDA for long term use, but it‚Äôs the only one I got addicted to physically.

It was scary, the body would get high blood pressure and high heart rate and nausea hours before the next nightly dose and each day you would have withdrawal 30 minutes earlier.

Once you take it your heart rate would go back to normal. But you couldn‚Äôt taper the pill to stop it as it was controlled release so cutting it would give you all at once.

I ended up cold ü¶É it and the withdrawal went away after the 35 hour mark. Held on to God hard that night and while I was only getting an hour a night when it was losing effectiveness (started out as 9 hours a night months earlier) that same night I stopped it and prayed I slept 5 hours without anything and sat in bed for hours watching my heart race until I got out of bed to kneel and beg for help.

Went back to bed still couldn‚Äôt sleep and so I prayed to everything and anything.

Once I finally slept I didn‚Äôt know what worked but I did know I only trusted God the most and over the weeks changed my routine to just include prayer to him.

Our bodies are all different I didn‚Äôt get withdrawals from mirtazapine or Ativan, but I got withdrawals from Lunesta and bowel movement peristalsis failure from seroquel. But there is a physician who knows you better than these blanket drugs do.

I hated it and tried for almost 2 years of near fatal insomnia in the face of ridicule and doctors telling me that I am sleeping although I count the clock each night I would try every few weeks to sleep on my own. To get away from doctors because they were like a crutch to rely on although they kept me well until I got help. I tried everything from mindfulness, to meditation to mantras, to Over the counter sleep aids, to CBD to yoga to exercise to primal therapy to herbs, chamomile, valerian, nootropics, energy work, CBT and sleep restriction, grounding mats, using red lights in my room, sunlight exposure during the day, night mask, blue light blocking glasses, mediums, sage cleansing, healing stones, acupressure, praying to spirit guides, praying to obscure new age angels, praying to ancestors, praying to dark angels to enforce boundaries that I couldn‚Äôt on my own as I‚Äôm an ‚Äúempath‚Äù (after which my pet died within the same week) and due to the nature of my insomnia being associated with bipolar, mania and psychosis I also tried faith related help and that‚Äôs what worked for me.

None of the other interventions worked, even having others pray for me didn‚Äôt work. Praying didn‚Äôt work either, but it was clear as day when I asked if God was still there in my life and willing to work with me I slept 8 hours on my own and then went another 300 days unable to get an hour of rest on my own without drugs. And no matter how I tried to mirror the same behavior on subsequent nights I couldn‚Äôt get even an hour of sleep again and I knew something was off that one night.

I came up to a point when I got desperate again and was getting addicted to Lunesta with withdrawals (150 bpm heart rate) getting earlier and earlier each day in the afternoon and hours to go before the next dose should come and did the one thing I was avoiding in prayer, which was begging and sobbing. It became hard for me to deny what happened, because I‚Äôve cried on other nights in frustration and anger due to insomnia but it wasn‚Äôt until I made myself small and admitted I needed help and left it on the floor to God that he moved in a big way on my illness.

And it was not self help there was even a time I accused God of being evil especially after that night I reached out to him in anger asking for a sign and then he left me for almost a year after giving me an 8 hour taste of almost regular sleep again. But my mother corrected me and said she doesn‚Äôt think God is evil.

And he wasn‚Äôt, if it were not for those 300 days I couldn‚Äôt sleep again after sleeping long and well among other things that are too much to include here, I would have nothing to compare his presence to but because of how it happened the desert of 300 days without him after getting a night of BLISS made it clear as day.

Because if she‚Äôs taking it just for insomnia she probably is already on a low dose (15mg or less) 7.5mg is actually even stronger for sleep due to how it works.

For me faith brought me regular sleep. It wasn‚Äôt until I admitted I was helpless and would die if I couldn‚Äôt sleep and had to keep depending on meds and I begged forcing myself to sob on my knees at 5 in the morning for help sleeping.

Take it or leave it. It‚Äôs not meditation or prayer that does it but who answers, (God) remember that and ask humbly and politely as you‚Äôre talking to a person and explain your distress as you pray and do what you need to in order to politely show your desperation.

This worked for me, if you can leave pride at the door and and keep asking respectfully instead of cussing in a tantrum or relying on your own power which is CLEARLY not sufficient this may work for you too.

On the other hand the psych is sort of looking at healing you although she/he may not be using the right tools.

insomnia,f8q5l88,t1_f8q4tp5,1574712472.0,"I would say the withdrawal starts pretty soon if you don‚Äôt take it around the same time each day. The withdrawal for me feels like missing a Benzo.

Aside from that the only side effect is falling asleep quicker, feeling more rested , staying asleep longer, oh and a slight bitter taste on the tablet that kind of goes through your mouth at the 30 minute after ingesting mark. But that‚Äôs when you know it‚Äôs diffusing into your system.

I been on 3mg for 2 months. I feel more rested than on any other tablet, but my only main concern is if tolerance starts building. 

I like the feeling of gently coming out of sleep for 15-20 minutes in the morning. It works on gaba receptor in a different way than benzo I think it blocks gaba reuptake instead of just releasing gaba like chemicals."

I never tried getting off Lunesta yet but I have taken it a few hours late a few times. Aside from that the first few days I took Lunesta was heaven, but I feel it‚Äôs building a tolerance a tiny bit after 2 months use. Was able to get 12 hours sleep at first, now I get like 6 hours.

Ambien made me toss and turn delirious for 2 hours then I finally slept for 2 hours.

If you want to try the z drugs, I think Lunesta is better. Ambien has too short a half life.

Also, my sleep doc recommended REM Fresh which is melatonin but it slow releases slowly over 7 hours after you take it.

insomnia,f8q2y02,t1_f8p479c,1574711300.0,"Ahh the Trazodone, was a dream for me until it suddenly stopped working after 3 months. 

Personal experience be careful with the z drugs like zopiclone and eszopiclone (Ambien, Lunesta), they are for me addictive.

Ativan (cousin of Xanax is my fall back) but I do recommend exploring Mirtazapine which works similarly to Trazodone but is only sedating at its lowest doses 7.5mg and 15mg and gives you ease of falling back asleep (although I still woke up each hour or two but each time I did I could drift back to sleep within 2 minutes) I stopped it due to vivid dreams which was a bad mix with my already vivid dreams from trauma and psychosis. But some don‚Äôt report vivid strange dreams.

I‚Äôm thinking of going back on mirtaz again because I don‚Äôt like that Lunesta headache and stiff muscle feeling from taking a dose a few hours too late. What I really want is to go back on Trazodone but when 25mg was enough to get 10 hours within 3 months I was taking 125mg and getting only 1 hour.

Be careful of sedating antipsychotics, Seroquel and Olanzapine they cause muscular tone weakness, low blood pressure and vasoconstriction side effects for me, although they produce heavenly sleep.

1st look into delayed sleep phase disorder, some people have a biological clock that‚Äôs like 28 hours or more, so you just can‚Äôt force yourself to sleep in tune with the day/night cycle.

You‚Äôll be likely able to sleep and want to eat again, function though? If tiredness and hunger were the cause of the poor function then I guess it will be good for that, but Mirtazapine makes you kind of like a woopy zombie but you can get somewhat used to it. Zombie effect is stronger at sedative doses like 7.5 and 15mg. The drowsiness stays in your system for like 18 hours after ingestion, you can still get up and likely will due to hunger to attack the fridge (it‚Äôs not a sleep walking thing in my case) but you‚Äôll feel loopy a bit.

Higher doses make you hungrier but work less for sleep. Too high a dose and you may gain weight and still not sleep.

Low doses like 7.5mg to 15mg will often help both stimulate appetite and sleep.

But when I was on 30mg I gained 26 lbs in a month which is unusual for my metabolism. The weight came off when I stopped. But there was no reason to be on 30mg because my insomnia was no longer being helped by that dose and there are other antidepressants that don‚Äôt cause weight gain (like Prozac).

Weight gain is typical of higher doses used for depression. Lower doses have sedating effect that‚Äôs canceled in higher doses when norepinephrine counteracts the histamine and serotonin activity.

So if you get a deductible or end up paying the whole thing it‚Äôs not very expensive as some drugs can get. Make sure you get the generic though.

Hope you don‚Äôt get the excessive rem dream issue and can enjoy all its benefits. Because the level of sedation can be played with by slightly raising the dose to like 10 or 12 mg. Tablets are easy to cut and not time release. It just has a very long half life compared to other sleep aids and raising the dose kind of lowers the sleepy quality, so I think the best way it to take it early evening so you are impaired in the hours before bed instead of during your daytime obligation.

Mirtazapine is great, you feel drowsy yes, but it doesn‚Äôt really throw your balance off or anything and there‚Äôs no weird blood pressure drops from waking up to use the bathroom and falling back asleep is soothing and easy, I pray that it works for you cause it sounds like this could be a blessing for you assuming you‚Äôre one of those who don‚Äôt fight a horror movie as the main character every time you finally get to sleep.

insomnia,f5zsea7,t1_f5zqmzw,1572585649.0,"In that case I would take to a few hours before bed time. If you have a history of depression and insomnia the doctors would probably be happy to try it. This drug is developed for depression but is commonly used off label for insomnia and anorexia (it makes you have the munchies).

I would try your GP, sleep doc or a psychiatrist in that order. Cause sometimes all we need is something that makes us cope and feel almost normal again. But psychiatrists might start trying to get you to take all kinds of bipolar meds, add-on-antidepressants and even antipsychotics. All in all, Mirtazapine is commonly seen as a sleep aid to use since it‚Äôs not addictive rather than giving out Benzos or Ambien or Lunesta, some docs would rather prescribe less addicting drugs and Trazodone and Mirtazapine happen to be two of those drugs.

I had problems getting sleep meds from my psych but he eventually believed I was having ocd delusions of not sleeping and stopped giving me sleep meds. So I went to my GP and easily got Ativan and I went to a sleep doc and got Lunesta.

Tell your GP you have horrible trouble sleeping and would like to try a non addictive solution like Mirtazapine. I hear that it‚Äôs given to elderly patients in nursing homes all the time to help them.

I genuinely hope you get some and that the abnormal dreams don‚Äôt come. In your state this might be a great boost to your life to have some control over sleep again. I even consider going back on it sometimes but the 18 hours of effect is not what I‚Äôm looking for right now. I have like 100 days worth of it left.

If he or she asks what dose you want try saying 15mg but only use 7.5mg as that helps double your on hand supply of sleep. But they might already know this and if they question why that dose you can say you don‚Äôt want it to be as sedating and go down to 7.5mg if necessary.
 And of course use the 7.5 dose (you can break the pill) and if your first night goes well you can check how long after bedtime you were still loopy and high and take it that much earlier in the evening the day before. If you get prescribed 15 but only need 7.5 that‚Äôs great. 15 was still sedating but the whole architecture of how many hours it works to make it easier to fall asleep changes a bit at that dose.

I hope you get to try it and ur works out.
 So you got things to do, see your doc about it and why Mirtazapine (non addictive, induces sleep) common off label insomnia treatment for its safety profile. Let them know that you are interested in the lower doses 7.5 and 15mg to see which dose is right for you.

I think you can get it. I‚Äôve only ever got it from psychiatrists, but some GPs might prescribe it too."
insomnia,f5zqbf5,t3_dpkvbp,1572583718.0,"Mirtazapine is really powerful and you can sleep on and off for up to 16 hours after taking 7.5mg. For some it causes endless vivid strange dreams that are just as exhausting as being awake the whole night, but others don‚Äôt report any issues with excessive and abnormal dreaming.

Trazodone is great but loses effectiveness quickly.

Ativan doesn‚Äôt really give you a lot of drowsy time (drifting in and out of sleep) it kind of just knocks you out before you get the chance to enjoy slowly going to tranquil rest.

Don‚Äôt let people tell you that you don‚Äôt experience sleep. Those of us who used to sleep well at some point in their lives before insomnia took hold, know that there are many stages of healthy sleep, light sleep, drowsiness, slowly waking up while drifting into and out of light sleep when you wake up in the morning after your refreshing main body of sleep.

For me, Mirtazapine gives you that drifting into and out of sleep feeling and doesn‚Äôt come in one solid whammy that gives you amnesia where you don‚Äôt even get to recall the pleasure of coming through different stages of rest and rejuvenation. There‚Äôs nothing quite like it, but for many it causes excessive rem sleep abs appetite cravings.

Just throwing that out there, I‚Äôve tried around 7 or 8 different precipitation sleep aids, and none of them were anything like Mirtazapine. I had to stop though because the crazy dreams were something that I had.

Just be warned though on Mirtazapine, it lasts like more than 12 hours (almost 18 hours) where you can still lay down at any time while it‚Äôs still in your system and slowly drift into light and rem sleep. Something about having control of the ability to take a nap or short sleep for 18 out of 24 hours of the day, Almost makes it feel like you don‚Äôt have insomnia anymore although Mirtazapine isn‚Äôt deep sleep or as restorative as natural sleep it made me quite able to relish in being able to wake up and go right back to sleep in 5-10 minutes if I wanted more sleep or went to the bathroom.

Try Mirtazapine and hopefully it doesn‚Äôt give you strange dreams. Weight gain usually happens on high doses used for depression not on low doses used for insomnia. Mirtazapine is most sedating at 7.5mg (lowest dose) cause at higher doses it has norepinephrine activity that counteracts its histamine and seritogenic activity.

Convince your doc to let you try it, you will be a zombie in it though during times when you take it before bed but it‚Äôs still strong in your system up til 4PM the next day, but having control again over being able lay down and drift off is something Mirtazapine offers.

My sleep doctor prescribed it because he says it doesn‚Äôt lower breathing effort and, but still sedates you (raises your arousal threshold). Because apparently I wake up 10-20 times an hour due to feeling like I‚Äôm not breathing, although my airway is not completely collapsing so it‚Äôs not apnea. 

Generally I find that Lunesta is very gentle going to sleep. Three effects it has on sleep patterns for me is I fall asleep quicker, wake up less often and it really convinces you to have a slow morning. If I can get access to the bed for 12 hours that‚Äôs about the longest I can still drift in and out of sleep for.

Both Lunesta and Ativan are controlled substances schedule IV, because of their dependency potential. I‚Äôve come on and off Ativan 5 or 6 times, I go back to it because it never built a tolerance for me, yes you have to taper to stop it though. Takes about a week to taper from 1.0mg.

Side effects I notice from Lunesta are generally I feel more rested, the tablet tastes kind of bitter, I get slight headaches when bedtime comes around again and I haven‚Äôt taken it yet and it‚Äôs a bit slow to feel ‚Äúready‚Äù to wake up come morning although it‚Äôs not because of a drugged or dizzy feeling.

Ativan only side effects for me was dry eyes. But when you take Ativan you got to keep taking it at the same time or you can get withdrawal (usually 12 hours after your missed dose) which is not fun. Ativan usually put me out in 1-2 hours after taking on empty stomach, and I would sleep for 6-7 hours with no wake ups. Ativan slows your reaction speed as if you were drunk and drowsy, but if you are only using it to sleep you would never notice it because the effect wears off long before you even wake up. I was on a long overnight flight before out of country and had to take it while on the plane due to the risk of developing withdrawal, the withdrawal went away but I was slow and stumbling around when we arrived and had to go through customs and baggage claim like a drunk.

Ativan and Lunesta both make it harder to remember your dreams, but Ativan more so.

I‚Äôve taken Ativan for about 1 year in total on and off, and Lunesta for about 30 days so far. Both Ativan and Lunesta have a half life long enough for a full night of sleep, it‚Äôs just about finding the right strength/dose.
