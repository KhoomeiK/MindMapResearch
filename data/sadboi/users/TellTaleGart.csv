My assigned therapist would come grab me occasionally throughout my stay, and that's when the ""real"" work begins, if that makes sense.

A ""fun"" story.

I hear what I can only describe as commotion for what I would guess what about 10-15 minutes, before the same nurse comes back up and says, ""Alright. So where were we?"" 


I have no idea what the hell happened that day, the nurse wouldn't tell me anything for obvious reasons, but all I know is that floor was on lockdown, with the lights turned off for the rest of the time I was there."
