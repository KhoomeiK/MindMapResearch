If i need surgery (which i probably do) i will def consider this option!! However i think im more afraid of the general inspection of my mouth. Its too basic to warrent anesthesia, and i dont think pain is the problem. I just do not like the idea of me being conscious while people i dont know dig in my mouth and tell me how to improve despite my best efforts. 
Thank you for the advice though!! I really appreciate it"

Worked at a liquor store and had quite the experience. One of the “compliments” i would receive is that i looked too young to work at a liquor store, followed by “it’s good to look that young because you’ll wish you looked like that when you’re older and start to wrinkle”. 
But one customer really stood out because his version of the above statement went something like “People pay a lot of money to have surgery to look as young as you”

What the hell"

Literally just today, i had a girl in her 20’s come in and insult her mother in ways that would have me dead if i said them to my own mother.

Preface: i work at an upscale liquor store. You get a mixed bag of wine moms, older couples, college students, and ofc trash. Fridays are when most trash comes in, because party time i guess. 

I had this customer come in, asking if she could show her id through her phone because she had left it wherever the fuck. Obviously, i cannot accept that. Nothing out of the ordinary really, in fact it seemed a lot easier than I anticipated... too easy...
Then she asks if her mom can pay instead. Now, at my store we only have to ID those who are paying because its too much of a net loss to id everyone in a group. So i agree, and her mother comes in, average mid-class looking woman, to buy her daughter the bottle she wanted. Mom seemed nice. Girl tells mom she will give her money but i butt in and tell her that if the mom takes the daughters money, i cannot sell her the merchandise. Daughter then asks me if she could pay outside of the store which i reply “dont tell me that” and then continue to scan the 1 item she wants. Mom does something daughter isnt happy with in the moment, i think it was over the price of the bottle, and daughter calls her own mom a stupid ass bitch or something. I blink, hard, thinking to myself “did you really just say that to your mom?” And the mom (rightfully) goes “what did your punkass just say to me bitch?” 

Im just standing there, listening to these two throw words back and forth at eachother preparing for a fight to break out. Thankfully, the mom purchases the drink and they are walking out, still yelling obscenities at eachother.

I had to collect myself after that."

The way its set up is you start from one end of the rink, and skate to the opposite end, touching the wall which was just thinly carpeted concrete. If you were the first to touch the wall, you won. So i was tied with 3 other people and it was the last round before one of us was touching the wall. The announcer yells: “GREEN LIGHT” and we all bolt. I touch the wall first! Before i can turn around, this whale of a person, maybe 200lbs to my at the time 60lbs (i was 12) smashes into my left arm, full speed because they cannot figure out how to use the skating breaks, crushing it between their body and the wall. Fractured.
Worst part: 
They ended up being the winner because I had to forfeit."
