alcoholism,fn1rv86,t3_fyt8eq,1586568658.0,Keep drinking or eventually die from it. I also most died from Covid-19 and at the same time found out my Dad is dying of stage 4 cancer(All happened in the last 6 weeks). Sometimes it takes that kind of perspective. I hope you live an amazing long life!
alcoholism,fn1r21b,t3_fys9e8,1586568125.0,"Keep going! I am also on day 4. I did go to detox bc I seized out trying to do it at home. You gotta stop the weed. Tried to do it that way many times. Altering your brain chemistry while it is ALSO being extremely shocked due to lack of alcohol just does not end well. Are you drinking at work? If the answer is no then that is not the environment you need to fix. Not trying to be preachy, just excited that we are both on the same day."

BPD,fj4dxeo,t3_fbhubm,1583006028.0,We cling from one person/connection to the next. We dont allow ourselves to feel and recover. For example all the passion of a 5 year relationship transfers to someone new that we have only known for a week. My advice is forgive and forget. She will never be what you see her as.

She told him everything I'd ever trusted her with about myself and the dude messaged me on facebook about everything just to rub it in. Betrayal is the worst. Don't swallow pills. It will just make it worse. Never let another person have that type of control over YOUR life. I went up the river myself and have to deal with looks whenever I wear a short sleeve shirt. Hangout with people as much as you can. Time helps but how much time only you will know."
