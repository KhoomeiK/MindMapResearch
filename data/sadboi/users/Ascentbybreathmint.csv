depression,exru84m,t3_cu6uwa,1566524256.0,Yessss. I totally understand how being angry at life makes you feel more motivated to beat it instead of letting it beat you. You are always deserving of happiness and a better life and you always will be. You're doing great! So proud of you.

I did comment to ask for advice and she was very nice and said to dm her to talk if I wanted. I decided not to dm her, but you can comment and ask for help, sheâ€™ll likely answer"
FamilyIssues,ex0zbgb,t3_cmw0x8,1565926073.0,"First of all, I think it would be easier to confront your sister before your Dad. I suggest you and her have a serious, sit down to talk this out. Tell her how her invasion of your privacy made you feel and tell her that it was not right of her. Tell her that you are struggling to cope with the situation and you need someone you can trust. Ask her if she can be that person. **At this point, do your best to read her emotions.** She might feel remorseful and apologize. If she does, remember to say, ""I accept your apology"" not, ""It's ok"" or ""It's fine."" What she did was not okay and you should make it clear that you won't tolerate the same mistake. If she looks awkward, like she feels a bit bad, this would be a good time to say something like, ""I just wanted to tell you this because what you did hurt my feelings."" Then just drop it and leave. Perhaps she'll apologize later. However, if she looks indifferent or like she doesn't regret her actions, drop the same line from before, but remember to be wary. Family can be a bitch and I know that old habits die hard. I know this can seem like a lot to communicate with someone that you dislike at the moment, but if you don't call them out on their mistakes, they cannot change. Obviously, you don't have to follow the exact directions I gave you, just be very assertive when you tell her how her wrongdoing made you feel. And be very perceptive of how she reacts. Also, I suggest starting to write your journal on your phone, in the notes app or a journaling app that has a passcode. Then, she cannot invade your privacy. Good luck and let me know how it goes."
depression,ex0xa7t,t1_ewuyzju,1565924531.0,"Ugh, we are in the same boat. Let's try to do our best together. I know there's gonna be stressful moments and bad days, but we can do it.

Edit: Today was my first day of senior year. The day was okay, but it started to fall apart tonight. I know I can figure it out though. I'll be okay."
depression,ex0v7l1,t3_cqqe91,1565923027.0,"This is amazing. It's honestly what I needed right now. I'm very worried about my sister who is currently in the same place as you were 2 years ago. She's decided to take a gap year, but when my family or I mention college, she becomes sad and avoidant. I feel bad that I can't do more for her as I am in high school at the moment. I was wondering if you could give me advice. My sister is very averse to the idea of going back to college because she doesn't want to become more depressed. What gave you the courage to pick up where you left off?"
depression,ex0ufs6,t1_ewx7gay,1565922486.0,"It is important to talk to loved ones! Your feelings are valid and you are not alone. You posting on this board proves that. I would be happy to just listen or give advice if you want. Whatever you need. C: I hope you feel better soon.

Edit: Despite what you think, you are not a burden to others. The people who love you do not think you are a burden, they want to help because they love you. Unconditional love may seem impossible, but it really just means that someone thinks the good days are worth the bad ones, even if there are more bad than good. There are people like that out there."
depression,ex0tz5y,t1_ewxxyxe,1565922164.0,"A good start is literally to just start. Even making a little progress will encourage you to do more and every little bit counts. Ask yourself if you can study for 10 minutes, or even 5 minutes. Assign yourself a little study session that makes you think, ""Yeah, I can definitely do that!"" It is very important to break the cycle of anxiety and depression: ""I can't do this.. but oh my god, it's due soon... I can't do this..."" Doing whatever you can, even if it's just studying for 5 minutes, can help you feel a little less anxious and more accomplished. Remember that your physical health is also very important and give your body the sleep/food it needs. I hope this helps. I believe in you. Good luck."
depression,ewapjpa,t3_cnechw,1565248865.0,"I definitely know what it's like from your girlfriend's perspective. I'm sure she is just happy that you're okay. She is probably trying to process everything you told her so that she can help you in the future by learning to notice red flags in order to prevent future attempts. Also, in regards to your shame, you are not being selfish and you are not a shitty person. You just weren't in the right mindset and managed to change your mind. There is no reason for your girlfriend to get mad, she probably understands that you were in a bad place and is happy you're safe. So glad that you're ok and that everything happened at the right time! You are very strong and remember that no matter what, somebody out there loves you 

Tldr: She's probably relieved that you're ok and she is just commiting some details to memory so she keep you safe in the future. Glad you're good."
