I've been trying so hard to communicate with him about my anxiety lately, but as time went on, i think I've gotten better but there r still times when my anxiety pops up harder than ever and that's when it all goes haywire between us again :( I'll srsly think about leaving him because honestly, i'm just even more tired and fed up. He is a rly smart person, but I think there are also times when u can die down ur pride a little even if it's smething u cannot completely understand :("
