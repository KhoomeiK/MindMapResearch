nonutnovember,f7ux72h,t3_dxne4s,1574018771.0,Still in. This morning had a challenging moment. Had godlike morning wood that was absurdly sensitive.
nonutnovember,f7pbupx,t3_dxa94s,1573947206.0,Still in. Depression is letting up. Feel motivated to keep going. Seeing an hourly count on how long to go really helps.
nonutnovember,f7ojuk7,t3_dx2i89,1573928648.0,Still in. Just kind of robotically going through the day avoiding temptation.
nonutnovember,f7kppi3,t3_dweunk,1573821863.0,Still in. Just kind of on auto pilot until December.

nonutnovember,f7heaxy,t3_dw2gbg,1573738874.0,"Still in. Finding each day is becoming more difficult but defeat at this point would be depressing.

Having a daily to do list helps. Staying busy makes it easier to avoid tempting thoughts. Take things one day at a time. Instead of thinking in days think of hours. That way you can see the number decrease more rapidly."
nonutnovember,f7edoqd,t3_dvrpef,1573654903.0,Still in. Finding nights are becoming more difficult. Once I have ten days left it should be easier.
nonutnovember,f7caail,t3_dv66ow,1573587865.0,Still in. I'm feeling rather depressed as of late but it makes me realize masturbation is just an impulsive coping mechanism. I need to make it all the way through.
nonutnovember,f78w5qy,t3_dusk25,1573499198.0,Still in. Morning wood is becoming an issue but I won't cave in.
nonutnovember,f770qg3,t1_f75lgv4,1573440787.0,I'm down.
nonutnovember,f75hzx6,t3_dub4m3,1573415344.0,"Still in thankfully. I had a horrible case of insomnia and depression. Didn't fall asleep until 5 this morning. Temptation was there but I know failure would make the depression much much worse.

Will not regret making it to December."
nonutnovember,f708qub,t3_dtu4zc,1573325652.0,Still in. Finding it has gotten easier since the first week is over.
nonutnovember,f6ylpij,t3_dtrjn1,1573286268.0,Still in. Starting to feel easier each day.
nonutnovember,f6x4a75,t3_dt8xx9,1573241611.0,Still in. Surprisingly I feel this is getting easier as time goes on for me.

I can't die as long as my parents still live."
depression,ew0gw56,t3_clue8y,1564988387.0,"I feel this. I will try to get immersed in something. Work, or exercise, or a movie or show on Netflix. I'll smoke or drink, yet the knowledge that one day I will be dead just hangs over me and it is hell."
