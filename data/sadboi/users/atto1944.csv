Erin: How do you return a cappuccino?"

MosinNagant,fmq2uaq,t1_fmq12w1,1586291859.0,"Nope, most likely a Finnish M24 at 51‚Äù with that early civil guard stamp. M39 rifles are 46 1/2‚Äù long."
MosinNagant,fmk7d8r,t3_fvqzjl,1586146443.0,"Sounds like you need a new trigger spring, not a new trigger. The blocky head of the sear spring interfaces against a protruding lug on the cocking piece to retain spring pressure against the firing pin until the trigger is pulled. Can you take any more close-ups of the trigger sear spring?"
MosinNagant,fkwirhj,t1_fkwfuw4,1584593741.0,That v shaped cutout doesn‚Äôt affect the cock-on-open operation on the Mosin. It‚Äôs the corresponding camming surfaces on the farther continuation of the cutout on the bolt body and cocking piece that do the work. The functionality of that cutout is to provide the cocking piece with leeway while the bolt is operated.

MosinNagant,f4w19us,t3_dm23hf,1571850596.0,"I think you mean hex receivers. A hex receiver will make a mosin more valuable because it indicates the rifle (or at the very least the receiver) was made with more care than some other round receivers you‚Äôll see with high receiver walls and crude machining marks/cuts. It rarely affects the functionality of the rifle, however. The front sight has the ring (or hood) to protect the front post from being bent. If you remove the front sight (hood and all) from the dovetail, you can even remove the front post from the assembly and replace with with a front post better for your shooting needs (longer, shorter, even skinnier)."
