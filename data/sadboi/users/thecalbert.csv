copypasta,flwgcdy,t3_frlohb,1585549687.0,"I make a point to empty my bladder precisely every 9.5 hours. It’s actually one of the only constants in my daily routine. One day, while contemplating the concept of existence through the very minuscule lens of which my mere perspective can subjectively perceive — as one often does — I realized the frivolous and arbitrary nature of natural pattern: our lives are but dependent leeches bound by the moon and the sun, averaging about 24 hours per oscillation, repeating approximately 365.25 times per solar year. These massive, yet objectively meaningless balls of matter, dictate our sleeping and waking patterns, in turn further binding our eating and conscious activity, limiting location and time based socioeconomic stratospheres, leaving virtually no breathing room for variation, realization of identity, and, therefore, expression of self. After reaching the dead end of this cyclical thought experiment, I decided to try to look for patterns I am not bound to, but, rather, I could take control over — one of which being precisely how often I make a massive 9.5 hour held piss. No matter how many bottles of spring water, or fruit-flavored carbonated caffeine supplements I ingest, 9.5 hours is the one constant I have true control over. And trust me, when the next piss comes, you do NOT want to be on the receiving end of my dextroamphetamine-almond milk-asparagus-tinged, Mtn. Dew Kickstart fueled, battery acid brew."

Having more airplay and name recognition means we’re more likely to get more (and potentially better) music, merch, concerts, etc. Music is art, but it’s also a business.

donaldglover,flanq1h,t1_flamut5,1584987499.0,"I thought so lol. It makes a lot of sense with the narrative progression of the song. To me that whole track is pulling from the STN MTN / Kauai concept of his internal struggle between what he wants to be and what the world/culture wants him to be. 21’s verse in this case would basically be one of his inner voices telling him to have the stereotypical Atl trap rapper lifestyle, but the girl/psilocybin/maybe the cat are pulling him in other directions, especially compounded with the fact that he’s tripping and in a vulnerable mental state.

Also I'm really debating getting a second one to keep mint, but I just don't have that much to drop right now."
tallyhall,fg7mhcd,t3_exdhk7,1580596102.0,"Like many others on here, I discovered Hawaii: Pt II pretty late. Last summer, I was on vacation visiting family that I don't get to see much, and my cousin happened to play Dream Sweet in Sea Major while we were in the car. She said she had just found it from some recommended Spotify playlist, and thought it sounded cool. I was instantly intrigued, and suddenly found myself listening to the album on repeat for months on end. 

&#x200B;

Around the same time, I started collecting records. I had received a few as gifts here and there, but I just hung them on my wall as decoration, since I didn't have a record player. But, eventually I bought my first janky turntable/preamp/all-in-one, and I was hooked. Since then, I was lucky enough to be given a fantastic stereo system from my girlfriend's grandfather, and my collection has been steadily growing, along with my appreciation for physical, intentional listening experiences. 

&#x200B;

Hawaii: Pt II quickly became one of my favorite albums of all time, and owning it as on vinyl was a dream of mine, although I knew, rationally, I'd never get my hands on one. (That didn't stop me from asking about it at every record store I went to, just in case.) I literally cannot believe that a couple days ago, I just happened to see a notification from the Tally Hall discord about the repress, and now it's sitting happily among my collection."
Kanye,fepsd9j,t1_fe96zil,1579329633.0,"For real. They could've easily squeezed it onto 2LP, or just did 3 and kept the last side for See Me Now"
Kanye,fecu2mn,t1_fdrpyw1,1578984639.0,Exactly. Also the fact that he said Hell of a Life is 'supposed' to be a song about sex. Just admit you don't understand the narrative and move along.
PostMalone,fectxq7,t1_fdpw0kj,1578984484.0,"That's definitely a possibility, but it hasn't happened yet, and I feel like it really wouldn't be that big of a deal if it did. *(It usually doesn't take much to impress me though. With the exception of Chance's ""The Big Day,"" I can't remember a time I was seriously let down with a hyped release.)* Another complaint I have with modern music consumption is that as soon as something drops, everybody has an instant opinion on it, and it can be hard to ignore that expectation and develop my own opinion. So if I wind up waiting for an album and it disappoints me, at least I'll know for sure that I don't like it and I'm not just following what I'm 'supposed' to think of it.

Plus, I could always just sell it if I really don't like it lol"
PostMalone,fdpuxqw,t1_fdpt3d7,1578641523.0,"The reason I started getting into collecting records is because it's really a different experience having to physically engage with an album in order to listen to it. If I always have access to music, it becomes a passive listening process. But if I limit myself to only physical albums, it makes the experience more special IMO.

 I did the same thing when IGOR dropped, but that was because I was listening to it wayyy too much and I was worried I was gonna get burned out on it and not be able to enjoy it as much when the record shipped. When it finally shipped, I was so excited to hear it again and it just made the album more memorable for me personally."
