Yes, certain aspects of life will certainly be more challenging as a lesbian and I think it is the case for anyone else from the lgbtq community. Having said that there are plenty of people out there who would love to support you and have experienced similar issues, possibly going through exactly the same thing right now. Not sure there are many on this sub, but look for others as I'm sure they are out there! When I feel more optimistic, I really can see the world is very slowly evolving towards a more tolerant and equal place, although it is still very challenging, but my sense is that we won't live to see things perfect everywhere in the world. I don't know if it is the depression or perhaps your religious beliefs that make you think otherwise, but you're perfect the way you are! If you feel ready, maybe it would help you to do some research on lesbian or lgbtq support organisations in your area. Also if you are currently experiencing harassment or bullying, talk to someone you trust and please report it! I don't know where you live, but in most places it is illegal to discriminate someone on the basis of their sexual orientation and it is also illegal and inhumane to provide any form of conversion therapy. Find out if the law protects you where you are. Look after yourself and hope you feel better soon!"

Is this a general lack of interest in life or just sex? Is this change linked to shifts in the relationship with your sexual partner/s? It can also be part of the depression for sure, but the way you wrote the post makes me think it was something sudden and unexpected. Maybe you need other aspects of yourself to be stimulated and explored right now. What do you enjoy doing? Sport, artistic, social activities?"
depression,exmby7g,t3_cth66r,1566428468.0,"I hear you and I am so so sorry you feel that way. It sounds like a very lonely and dark place to be at. I can identify with the states you describe although everyone's experience is different. As it was pointed before, you do have a great deal of self-awareness and emotional literacy, which suggests you have an enquiring, reflective mind and the capacity to attune to your own internal ups and downs. I admire your bravery for posting your honest feelings here. This might not have been your intention but reading your post has made me feel less alone! I would strongly recommend talking to someone in your area. If you are not ready for a face to face therapist or counsellor, you can always try calling the samaritans. It is completely anonymous. Best of luck and take care!"
productivity,ewzmd7s,t3_cq9dyc,1565897710.0,Haha! So true
lawofattraction,ewzm75m,t3_cqobdl,1565897649.0,All the best in fulfilling your dreams! Sending you positive energy!!
depression,ewo5yfq,t1_ewn0xei,1565607303.0,"You're so right! I have to remind myself constantly that those isolating and negative internal dialogues with myself are part of the illness/condition/disorder. At times, I actually 'forget' that I have a condition and get so drawn by  them that I embody that negativity. Long term therapy has helped a lot with that even though it is a life long struggle, especially at testing times, of transitions - college, uni, etc, or the illness of a loved one - in my case."
