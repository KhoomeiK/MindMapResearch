Some use what is called a Belt Alternator Starter.  Alternators and Generators can also works as motors. You just need the control electronics to send power to them.  So in normal mode, the alternator supplies electricity to run the car and charge the batter. In start/stop mode when it is time to start the car, electricity is supplied to the alternator to turn it into a starter.  This method is more expensive, but is more reliable and has better NVH\[1\] characteristics. The bulk of the cost is the inverter to turn the DC current of the car battery into the AC current that the alternator needs to work as a motor.
