My biggest advice would be this: eat your points.  WW gives them to you, so use them.  Dailies?  Eat them all.  Weeklies?  Use them.  That's what they are there for, and even if you use every single last one of them, you WILL lose weight.

I tend to hoard my weeklies until the end of the week, so I can relax a bit on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

Your mileage may vary, but I do *not* count points for olive oil or avocado.  We know that both are very healthy for the heart, and I think that WW is unreasonable as to their point values, especially avocado.  So I just give myself that little gift.  I eat avocado every week, and I still lose.

It's an adjustment, but I think you will be so happy with it.  Welcome to Blue."
