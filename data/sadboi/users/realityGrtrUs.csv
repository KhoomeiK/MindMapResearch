You likely should press charges so that your parents can better understand the gravity of their actions. This is not vengeful, this is educational. They need to learn compassion and consequences.

Also agree that you're in a much better place now with the distance forced in you, removing you from their toxic presence. A brief bit of turmoil for sure, then an amazing progress in your life.

A parting thought I haven't seen in the 200+ comments so far.  Jesus Christ loves all of us and clearly condemns your parents behavior. Please tell them. Make sure they know that you know Jesus Christ is so much better than how they are treating you.

God bless and may Jesus continue to guide your steps."
