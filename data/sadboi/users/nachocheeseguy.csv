DotA2,fchtyso,t1_fchtiov,1577654107.0,"For sure, I played my first one a month back and boy did I get smacked. BM’d pretty hard but I get it. Games are sometimes over an hour and having someone as bad as I was would be incredibly frustrating. So spent a ton of time in Turbo games and learned a lot. I think I’m gonna support every game and pray for patient teammates, because I am willing to learn and always let the team know if they need me to build a certain item or ward certain spots to please let me know."
