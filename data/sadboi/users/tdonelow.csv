personalfinance,femcxis,t3_epvzov,1579249134.0,"Generally you can call collections and they will put a hold on the account while they open up it up for dispute. However, I will tell you that many times when my medical bills go to collections they will often give me a 10-20% discount off the entirety off the bill if I pay it in full. So it ends up being cheaper and it doesn‚Äôt go on your report if you pay it before it gets reported. Of course, this has just been my general experience."
AskHR,f8dukuo,t3_e0gc3d,1574510005.0,"You should also look at benefits before comparing. How much does the company pay towards medical/dental/vision? Do they offer a 401(k) match? What type of ancillaries do they offer? 

Benefits also make a significant difference if you participate. For example, it might be 4K more in salary but in the long run you end up paying more due to a loss in benefits if you‚Äôre not comparing apples to apples."

humanresources,f02rutx,t1_f02o95e,1568336855.0,"I definitively don‚Äôt mind! For me, customer service and communication are huge. Most payroll companies are going to be able to be offer you similar or comparable systems. Most of them are customized to your company during implementation anyways. However, Paycom, for me had terrible customer service and communication. During our short one year stint with them we had three service reps which definitely contributed to these issues. 

I also just received an ESRP notice for tax year 2017 due to a 1094 filing error. This was in part contributed to the fact we had to multiple errors in part due to the implementation. It was rushed and not properly handled. Not to say it was totally Paycom‚Äôs fault, but it contributed. 

Then, when I tried to call Paycom to request the 1094 documents because I could not find the electronic documents from 2017, they wanted $8000 for 90 days access even though this was partially (mostly) due to the error on their part. They also wouldn‚Äôt negotiate and allow me access for any less than 90 days or just send me the 1094s. 

I hope this helps! I have some more, but I figured this was a lot. Lol"
