truegaming,fpp3mn1,t3_geeipr,1588795379.0,"I've been playing through Dark Souls with a friend for a while now, and I'm not sure I've ever had so much fun playing a game with him. The game has such a weird approach to multiplayer that at once it feels like the multiplayer doesn't matter all that much and yet also feels integral to the game as a whole.

It can most definitely be played as a single player only game, so you'd think co-op wouldn't add that much. But going through that world, experiencing its bleakness and crushing difficulty together with a friend, there's nothing like it. Whether we're clearing a small area of mobs or facing a gargantuan boss together, I have never experienced such a sense of comradery in all my years of gaming.

And I think a big part of it is difficulty, as well as the way the game can be played solo. It creates these situations where we depend on each other, while also being independent from each other. He kills an enemy I overlooked that was coming up behind me. I aggro a boss for him so he can heal or shoot magic at it. I distract an enemy player so he can come up and backstab him.

As much as I love games like Left 4 Dead, they force cooperation with people. And that's a cool way to go about it, but it ends up feeling like you have your teammates just so you don't get killed by a creature that takes away your ability to fight back. Dark Souls is more organic, you're not forced to cooperate by any means. But the difficulty will make you glad you have somebody watching your back. And it creates a bonding experience for you because you're facing the danger together. The cooperative elements aren't really a mechanic like they are in Left 4 Dead, they're something you naturally form and develop. Even with strangers, people I never talked to, I've felt this (to a lesser extent) playing Dark Souls with them.

Point is, whatever the Souls series did, they got it right, better than any other game has. I mean that's just me though, I'm sure other people have way different tastes and think the Souls co-op experience is garbage :P"

HitBoxPorn,fohmd3a,t1_fog70t4,1587768360.0,"If you decide to keep playing after finishing the game, be sure to fully upgrade the first smg and sniper rifle. If you do you'll get a gatling gun for Chris (for upgrading the smg) and a longbow for Sheva (for the sniper rifle). The gatling gun feels cheap but the longbow, while strong enough to kill standard enemies in one hit, doesn't come with a laser sight or any other aim assisting tool. So you have to actually work on your aim with it instead of relying on a reticle (the arrows also have light gravity drop). It's a pretty steep learning curve, but once you start to get it down it becomes the most satisfying weapon in the game imo. Sometimes I like to go and revisit RE5 just because longbow gameplay can be so much fun.

Sorry for being so long winded, I just love RE5 and it's really good to see that other people appreciate this game too."

My memory's a little vague on it, but basically you play this dorkie guy named Joe who goes to the movies with her. The villains in the movie come to life, reach out of the screen, and kidnap her. So he goes after her. Once he gets in he gets a device that I think was called a V-watch that transforms him into the superhero Viewtiful Joe.

The game itself is a side-scrolling brawler. But you get cool af powers called vfx that allow you to: slow down time, fast forward, zoom in, and in the second game you can ""instant replay"" one of your hits. It's hard to explain how each power would be useful but they're super fun to play around with.

It's really difficult at times, especially the boss fights, but the gameplay is unique and truly a blast. The art style is cell shaded and looks very stylish. And the voice acting and humor are super duper campy and dumb and I love it. It's just a gem through-and-through and I'd recommend it to pretty much anybody.
