LDR,fr0ojdp,t1_fr00yvt,1589802500.0,"I completely understand how you feel. I deal with a lot of anxiety and abandonment issues. He would forget selfies too. I basically had to find a place where I was secure in the relationship enough to ask for what I need without being needy. 

So I asked him what he needed from me, and he said my happiness was the only thing he needed. So, thats what I did. Instead of throwing myself a pity party, which I had become good at, I would present it that way to him. Like “Remember when you said you only wanted me to be happy? A new picture of yourself without your beard would make me soo happy” or something to that effect. Next thing I knew he was sneaking me a selfie while his extended family was visitng for Ramadan!! Then as his new behavior started to snowball, I just kept reminding him how happy he was making me. And of course I find many ways to make him happy as well. 

Ive never felt more secure and loved as I started changing my security attachment in relationships. Its hard not to let those old attachment styles affect you, esp when you’re finally in a healthy (albiet, complete with normal human mistakes) relationship. I still have underlying fears of abandonment but I’m trying to let all of his other actions speak louder and take precedent. But it had to start with me. His actions just helped me feel even more secure. 

But he has to know how that affects you. If he truly wants your happiness, he will step up. And if all of his other qualities outweigh this, you will have to be patient with him. Once I wrote down and realized everything else my partner was bringing to the relationship, while it was still annoying and hurtful, it was something I could work with him on given everything else we had that was amazing."

LDR,fr003zm,t3_gl4ej2,1589779907.0,"Yes this is very much a human thing. My partner is like this too. It used to drive me absolutely crazy! Until I stop taking it personally. 

I just realized just how he is and he can be forgetful when it comes to returning phone calls. I decided to except it as a quirk. He’s great with text and he will call but sometimes he forgets when he says he’ll call me back later. 

So one of the last times when he went to say that he would call me back, I told him it’s OK you don’t have to say it we can just say goodbye. I was very loving and he even stuck his tongue out at me we made a joke about it. 

Then the next day we were talking and he had to go and said he would call me back but then the video froze. So I didn’t get to say anything and next thing I know I was saying goodbye. I really didn’t expect him to call back but then a few hours later he did call back!!!... it was like the best surprise in the whole world. I was genuinely shocked and felt so loved. 

And that’s how I’ve decided to start treating this. But he also has put in a lot of effort which helps ease my anxiety. Plus just being playful about it really helps because we all do forget things from time to time."

What most analysts are looking at for travel as far as the global economy is concerned means tourist travel destinations. Places where there are large crowds an influx of people all day. Hotels, resorts other high volume places people stay.

What most of us on this sub are going to be dealing with, as far as international travel is concerned, is a matter of feeling safe on the airplane and knowing our SO and their family are not sick ... because we do have the option of being extra safe and isolating with our significant other once there. Most of us aren’t going to go to big tourist destinations when all we want to do is spend time with our significant other. And I’m sure alot of us here will not be staying in a hotel.

If they can never tell you who they are with or where they are 

If they aren’t ever able to do a random video call or selfie...or video at all!!!...just a big no for me.

But if he wasn’t telling people about me or telling me who hes with and I found out that it was a bunch of girls. That would make me feel uncomfortable. I don’t blame you for feeling the way you do or wanting to get more information on the situation.

The fact that he told you that he was with a bunch of girls and told you that he told them about you is a good sign.

Duolingo has been really great in giving me a basis and understanding for a lot of words and phrases that I already knew and has helped me understand the language as a whole much better. 

I would recommend learning all the romantic words and phrases first. Just google it and you will find websites with lists of Arabic love phrases. There are SOOO many! Most of them are fairly simple but very poignant. Arabic is really the language of love. 

And don’t bother trying to learn the Arabic characters right now. Focus on the transliteration. Which is written the way the Arabic sounds but written out in Latin-based letters.

LongDistance,fnyu833,t1_fnyibi3,1587375850.0,"Whatever “label” a couple agrees on that is best for them is whatever they want to make it. The simple fact that people have employed breaks in their relationship is proof they are an “actual thing”. My sister is in a seperation rn. Thats just a “break” of different proportions. 

Thankfully, her and  husband have been seeing each other more often and positively lately. Its working for them and has for others, including myself. But they are local relationships. I just wanted an LDR perspective. 

Now, whether you believe they WORK or not ...that its just an excuse for cheating, etc...well that is very much up to you. But thats not why I asked :) Your opinion is valid, however, I specifically asked, “from others who have been in a similar situation.” 

Thank you for your comment and well wishes!"

And if you need to ask him for a little reassurance you are totally within your right. If he is supportive, he’ll give that little bit extra to you when you need it. Stay strong."

LongDistance,fnk6abn,t3_g1ufdx,1587016248.0,The way they’re talking here in America we could be back to a little bit of normal every day life this summer. But no major events and crowds that are typical and summer. Not sure what this means for the airlines. But I the way things are going...I have confidence that it will at least be sometime later this summer.

Plus there are like a million love/pet names to call someone in Arabic. It really is the language of love. The one we use the most is “ya rohy” which is a way to call to someone who is, “my soul” or “soulmate”."

LDR,fn411wf,t1_fn3fmmf,1586631888.0,"We have two tentative dates for summer. I really like the idea of talking about what to do on the first day. I have a feeling I know already... lounging around on each other and listening to music and talking. Perfection. We can go see the pyramids and markets any day LOL 

We have talked about places we would go. I told him I wanted to see the pyramids and he kind of rolled his eyes in a playful way (bc its like sooo touristy haha). So I said oh I can just go by myself if you don’t want to. And he knows I would too. And suddenly he was like “oh no no no I’ll go! I’ll go anywhere with you.” LOL  

He has a little place on the beach, Mediterranean side, and we have discussed spending a few days there. Ive seen a few pictures of him and his family there. It really makes me feel secure about this whole situation to visualize us there already."

The first time we did a video chat was surreal. We just giggled a lot. So many jitters and insecurities. Lol

Now we still laugh a lot (too much?) but it happens whenever. He’a seen me first thing in the morning in bed, making coffee and after a shower, etc. After a while you just become more comfortable. Its really nice to just have him there as part of my normal life few times/week. I honestly don’t know how people could do it before video chat/webcams."
