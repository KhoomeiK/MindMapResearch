depression,ff1wuv3,t3_er0weg,1579488009.0,I know exactly how you feel. Going to work out and meal prepping has helped me through the first two days. My advice for you would be to handle what needs to be done around the house and look up activities you can do around town. If people at work like you you're a likeable person and you can eventually meet new friends you'll enjoy.
depression,feuadrr,t1_fet3xj3,1579384667.0,Thank you for the encouragement. I did go so I feel a bit better and I'm glad I got out the house but now I'm done.
depression,festxhh,t1_fesraak,1579368939.0,"I'll be starting my masters in the fall (hopefully). Like I should, I'll probably head to the gym in a bit hopefully I'll feel better but this has been a problem. Not sure if y'all relate"
depression,fesly6z,t1_feslkut,1579366626.0,"I've never really had dreams, like I want to get to a higher position in work but I don't enjoy anything"
Tombofannihilation,fd6x32d,t1_fd6gmna,1578196805.0,That's the plan maybe 1 session in Port Nayzaru to set the scene. Then a montage of Chult's greatest hits. How long did it take you to finish the adventure?
Tombofannihilation,fd01o64,t1_fd00t57,1578112316.0,"Yeah, after scanning through this subreddit more it makes more sense. The creatures of chult are really cool but once you've seen them you've seen them. Omu sounds like the most fun so I'm excited when we get there."
depression,faojstx,t1_faojnsf,1576265941.0,"Yeah unfortunately everyone here has depression, which stops us from following through with anything"
depression,f58z9iy,t1_f58h1bz,1572067928.0,"Thanks for the encouragement I'll keep at it and try to get better, it's just tough not self sabotaging after getting used to being alone. I think I'm freaking out about gossip spreading that I'm awkward but that's just the challenge everyone faces."
depression,f58a70m,t3_dn6mb6,1572051986.0,"My advice to you would be to go hiking or to the water if you can. It might put you in a better mindset and there have been studies that 3 days in nature can reduce stress and anxiety. But that's just my opinion, do whatever works best for you."
depression,f589w9e,t3_dn6s3r,1572051747.0,"You sound like a good honest person. It sucks that people like you get depressed. What I've noticed is my interests change as I get older to more intrinsic values instead of material things,  maybe it's the same for you. Wish you the best in finding true friendships and relationships!"
depression,etcx8zm,t1_etcvf0v,1562694543.0,Yeah definitely. Being with friends is the easiest way to forget about the past. Still its harder to meet new people as I get older... Also my job keeps me isolated from people and ive noticed my social skills deteriorate. Spent a year and a half where i worked by myself and lived by myself. Really fucked with my internal dialogue. Planning on just starting over in a new city with a new career. Sucks cuz i worked hard af to get where I am but living in isolation aint worth it bro.
depression,etct6m9,t1_etcrxyz,1562692121.0,I get what your saying I really do. Having a positive mindset makes our interpretation of life positive. But some of us are ashamed of our past and dont like how we act in the present. It's hard to focus solely on the positives when we are ashamed of our past and have a hard time trying to shed our baggage.
depression,etcrhwi,t3_cb30bk,1562691114.0,If only lol. Thanks for the positivity tho
depression,etcrbcv,t1_etcqxrk,1562691006.0,Thank you. I'll try to remember and keep you posted on how i do. Probably won't make the jump until August when my surgery is finished.
SuicideWatch,es66w90,t3_c5zms0,1561642110.0,"I have... Don't. Even though it feels like severe depression lasts forever it won't always when you make changes (in my experience 4 years severe depression in college b/c i didnt want to be there but once i got out my severe depression stopped). Once you cut yourself off it's weird coming back, even taking photos of yourself. In this digital age social media is important and Christmas/Thanksgiving alone sucks. Don't make the same mistake i did by isolating yourself."
