I can’t speak to your situation, but I don’t think actually talking to his ex or trying to proposition her necessarily validates that he meant what he said. Just because you follow through with your actions does not make the thinking behind it any less mad. 

I’m really sorry you are going through this. I don’t want to give you false “hope”, you’re being incredibly supportive and it’s OK to want out.

But all I will say, from personal experience, is that his behaviour in this state is not out of the ordinary. If this aspect of his thinking returns to normal as he stabilises, then it’s the illness. If not, then yes, there may be something there.

A quick transition is not always better. Sometimes a bit of time is helpful, a bit of distance and perspective, because if it’s too quick and sharp  you can go into a kind of “shock” which in itself is destabilising and can lead to depression. It’s no picnic going from floridly manic without a care in the world on Tuesday to waking up realising you are broke and haven’t gone to work in weeks several days later. It’s too sudden.

For example, it’s perfectly possible, usual even, to be moody AND have bipolar. Those sorts of rapid fluctuation are being studied academically; it’s a bit like how wind gustiness (daily mood fluctuations) increases with wind speed (bipolar mood symptoms).

I know it’s easier said than done, but you’ve got to stop drinking FIRST and the rest will follow much more easily. This is simple, but not easy.

There are hundreds of resources on here about getting and staying sober which I won’t re-iterate here. They work. 

You may also have co-existing mental health issues, some of what you wrote suggests you might (not being able to live with your thoughts)? If you do, schedule an appt with a Dr as that needs treating alongside any alcohol / drug use. IME, mental stability gets rid of the desire to ruin yourself and your life. 

Don’t try to overthink things today, you’re hungover, feeling shit. You’ll only thing negative thoughts. But I can assure you that the self-loathing you feel is par for the course with addiction and I bet 99% of us here have felt the same or worse - it can and does get infinitely better.

BipolarReddit,fjtsfoc,t1_fjts1gx,1583610532.0,100% for sure. We are all biologically different. It has taken me years to get on my current stable combo.
BipolarReddit,fjtqjui,t1_fjtpnj8,1583610083.0,"Abilify? No, it made me very anxious and I also got akathisia. I hated it. Me personally..."
BipolarReddit,fjt2bye,t1_fjt23ae,1583602783.0,"That’s great, pls let him or her know! I take lithium, lamictal and quetiapine, all in relatively low doses and basically with no side effects. So there are lots of options.

Take care"
BipolarReddit,fjt1sac,t1_fjt0jco,1583602602.0,"Be careful - Abilify has been linked with compulsive gambling, spending, sex etc:

https://time.com/4317182/abilify-aristada-aripiprazole-sex-gambling/

I think there is a black box warning in the insert. You need to tell your psychiatrist. Personally, I tried Abilify and it was the worst medication I have ever taken. I hated it, but it works for some...

Good luck"
BipolarSOs,fjqv8e9,t3_fenyvs,1583578239.0,"Hope you don’t mind me offering my perspective as someone married with children with BP1. 

By definition an *untreated* bipolar person is going to be at the mercy of the illness. The illness is powerful enough to undermine any self preservation, including financial ruin, addiction and suicide. So it’s more than powerful enough to undermine even the strongest of relationships. 

IME, if you’re with someone who acknowledges the severity of this illness and is taking all responsibility to stay well, then it’s manageable. The same goes for being a (wonderful) parent. A BP person needs to be properly medicated and treated in order to contribute to a stable, loving and happy relationship and home. 

We need to commit to getting well and stay well. It’s a hard fight, but it’s certainly worth it."
BipolarReddit,fjkcq1j,t1_fjkbdv5,1583424609.0,"There are very many papers showing the effect of creatine on brain bio-energetics, not sure about bipolar specifically. However I’m sorry, you’re just going to have to take a common sense approach here and go by feel and it sounds like it isn’t working for you."
addiction,fjk23vp,t3_fduy7k,1583418291.0,"I used to think the same, but only because I had mental health conditions as well (Bipolar 1, ADHD) that made normal life impossible. 

However, I’m now properly medicated and don’t feel the same way (at all). It sounds to me like you have co-existing issues that require treating first.

Good luck"
BipolarReddit,fjjt6mh,t1_fjjt4ay,1583411383.0,"I would just stop taking it immediately - and speak to your doc, I tell mine everything I take, nutritional etc.

Good luck"
BipolarReddit,fjjsym6,t1_fjjsviz,1583411174.0,"I don’t know, creatine has lots of effects in the brain. Being on a mood stabiliser doesn’t mean we are immune to instability or mood episodes. I suspect it would be very much worse off the mood stabilisers."
BipolarReddit,fjjsofn,t1_fjjs84d,1583410909.0,"I’m afraid I can’t give you advice on taking creatine or any meds. What has worked for me is to only take a few grams on the days that I exercise (after exercising). 

Taking more than that led to rapid fire thoughts and inability to sleep more than a few hours. Plus extreme anxiety.

Good luck but tbh, it sounds like it doesn’t suit you, in which case you may wish to stop taking it."
BipolarReddit,fjjqvr9,t3_fdte1i,1583409073.0,"You do have to be careful taking creatine with bipolar. 

I can only tolerate a low dose - 2-3g straight after exercise 3x each week. If I take it daily, it also spins me into hypomania / mania."
BipolarReddit,fjjkluz,t3_fdq99b,1583400666.0,"Yes, I had terrible difficulties at 200mg. Lowered the dose to 100mg under doc supervision and it went away completely. No side effects at all."
BipolarReddit,fjecf1q,t1_fjebvei,1583269264.0,"Anything you buy over the counter, probably yes. But not medical-grade CBD that’s prescribed. At least not in my experience - and the research looks promising, even if it’s new. 

However, there are almost certainly better / cheaper first-line options for most people currently, I had just tried the full gamut and was somewhat treatment resistant, so they decided to try something experimental - and it worked. Brilliantly.

EDIT: I also take lamictal, lithium and quetiapine, so I use mainstream meds too. The combination is working great - for me."
BipolarReddit,fjdzwo9,t1_fjdputi,1583262490.0,Thank you :)
BipolarReddit,fjdl942,t3_fcwlm4,1583254750.0,"I think medical-grade CBD can be very helpful. I’m prescribed that and it certainly helps my anxiety and just chills me out generally. Probably helps psychosis a bit too. 

I would advise against “recreational” cannabis or anything with significant THC unless it’s trialled under Dr supervision i.e., certain forms of medical cannabis."
addiction,fjdflws,t3_fcwovx,1583252191.0,"No-one wants to face that sort of “temptation”, especially in the earliest stages of abstinence and recovery. 

It sounds as though you have to be frankly honest with yourself and to make a difficult decision - can you stay clean & sober doing your existing job and around your friends? If the answer is “no” - there’s your answer. You have to find and do something else. At least for now. At least until you have some abstinence under your belt and won’t risk relapsing (that may take years - or never). 

Depending on your answer, I think that’s the solution. It’s simple, but not necessarily easy. Good luck."
BipolarReddit,fjd71s0,t3_fcv8un,1583247140.0,"I’m sorry to hear this, but I’m also BP1 (lamictal, lithium, quetiapine) and alcohol ruins my mental state and stability too. I’m infinitely more likely to drink when I start becoming unstable and it accelerates the instability a thousand-fold. 

I do my very best to abstain completely from alcohol now. 

It has taken me a *very* long time to get to this point in my stability and recovery; it’s a process of acceptance, but it sounds like we’ve both experienced the horrors and are ready/able/willing to do what it takes. 

I hope you feel much better soon."
bipolar,fjcx92k,t3_fcto2v,1583239802.0,"Bro. I am so sorry for what you’re going through, I don’t know what to say, except please don’t kill yourself. Im BP1, I’ve tried suicide several times and now that I’m stable, I am eternally grateful that I’m still here.

However shit you feel right now and however shit circumstances in your life are right now (I hit rock bottom in the past) it can get better. I don’t know what to say beyond that, but please just reflect on this one stranger’s advice. I need to say something, because the loss of your life would affect me greatly."
BipolarSOs,fjcs23r,t1_fjcfwtn,1583234362.0,"Yes, I think this is spot on."
BipolarReddit,fjcryqo,t3_fcncc3,1583234246.0,"It’s a good combo. I take lamictal, lithium and quetiapine and it works well for me."
bipolar,fjcreuk,t3_fcr0a6,1583233529.0,"I’m really sorry to hear this. 

It sounds as though you’re stable from the perspective of the bipolar and have insight into your condition and what you’re dealing with. Your ex-BF has made you feel shit - this has nothing to do with you intrinsically as a person and it has nothing to do with your (or our) illness. 

Please try not to let this compromise your mental state or feelings of self-worth. I’m BP1 and I know how hard it takes to achieve stability. You should be commended, walk away now with your head held high."
bipolar,fjar83d,t3_fcggge,1583179039.0,I’m really glad you’re feeling better. I’m envious - what a beautiful route.
addiction,fjafg3p,t3_fceusv,1583172401.0,"I’m really sorry you’re having a rough day, but I promise you being entirely clean beats the alternative. However shit life feels *right now*, it can be 10x worse in a flash with drugs. 

Presumably you’re trying to stay clean because you’ve tasted the pain of addiction, please try not to romanticise the high (for your sake). I’ve lived the utter misery and I bet you have too. 

I’m sorry today is a shit day, but today will pass - if you remain clean, you’ll have some good days ahead. Good luck man"
bipolar_irl,fja0gk3,t3_fccfua,1583163759.0,I’ve had them many times in the past. Not recently since my meds and lifestyle have been working. Mixed episodes are horrific. Truly awful.
bipolar,fj4y978,t1_fj4xa5d,1583019784.0,"Being supportive and educating him as much as possible is probably all you can do. 

But if he isn’t taking his meds, it’s a very tough road. When I was first diagnosed in 2012, I refused to take meds. My psychiatrist at the time called my wife and said it might take “rock bottom” before I accepted the reality of my diagnosis. 

Sadly, that’s what it took. Since then, I take managing it very seriously. 

I hope your BF accepts that this is a serious illness and is able to take appropriate action."
bipolar,fj4je0q,t3_fbexbx,1583009640.0,"I’m BP1 and I’ve also had drug and alcohol issues. In my experience, if you’re well medicated / stable, the desire to drink isn’t there. It’s an issue when your mental state is out of whack and that needs addressing.

So, if you’re drinking regularly, you won’t ever feel stable if you have BP, which will make you want to drink and down that rabbit hole you go. 

So I think he needs to get stable first; even stopping drinking for long enough to know what that means / what he’s aiming for. This has taken me years, and I’m still learning.

Good luck."
BipolarReddit,fj1ci0o,t3_faxptx,1582917218.0,"I agree with everything you wrote, not least because I’ve learnt from experience that stopping my meds *always* leads to a relapse and an urgent mental health crisis. 

Like you, I have also become much more disciplined in managing this illness, which includes avoiding alcohol etc. 

All of this takes a great deal of acceptance, but it has gotten much easier."
bipolar,fiyeahz,t1_fiy75vc,1582837743.0,"I’m sorry you’ve had a bad experience and glad you know what you’re doing and can advocate for yourself.

I hope you get to see a good private psychiatrist and establish a great therapeutic alliance. 

Take care"
BipolarSOs,fiye0fh,t3_faigde,1582837588.0,"Don’t do that. I can tell you from experience what happens (BP1):

It’s hugely destabilising and dangerous - you are very likely to have a relapse (up or down - or both). Every single time I’ve stopped my meds I have had a mental health crisis and required urgent support (and more meds in an acute setting) to get back on track. 

I no longer stop my meds completely and I’m generally med compliant. Please learn from my mistake(s) and do the same."
