AskReddit,fk6i9be,t3_fghdvd,1583902939.0,"This will be buried, but might as well tell the story while I have a chance. 

I've worked for a small chain pet store for the past 2.5 years. I started out as a sales associate, but the coworker I'll be talking about today was hired on at the same time as me, but he was a keyholder. 

This guy was shady as I don't know what. At first, he seemed like a good worker, did what the managers told him to do, sold enough product that he'd be making bank if we had been paid commission, etc. Then, after a few months, things started going downhill. 

I worked with him the most during the evening shift, when there's only a manager and an associate in the store. He'd get lazy sometimes in the evenings and throw the work he didn't want to do on top of me. I'd do it, and it taught me how to become a better worker, but I'd always get the stuff he was told to do, but didn't want to. Since it was only the two of us there during those times, I was supposed to be the person to run out and get his lunch, but he insisted on going, while I was stuck at the store with no way to process returns because I didn't have a manager code at the time. He was told multiple times to send me to get his lunch instead of me going. He got his own lunch until he quit. 

He also was a pathological liar, and everything that he messed up on, when the managers asked for his side of the story, I was always to blame. It got to the point where they'd ask me what happened and would know I was telling the truth because of how over exaggerated his stories were. The one that boils my blood the most is we got a counterfiet $100 bill once. I asked him to double check it because something seemed off about it and he just glanced at it and said it was fine. When it was discovered that we had taken a counterfeit because he told me to, he threw me under the bus and said I never asked him about anything and it was my fault. 

He'd also make shit up when trying to sell stuff to customers. 

There were a couple times he was supposed to open the store, but didn't show up until the middle of the day. When our groomers showed up, they'd have to call the store manager and get him to come in since their first appointment was when the store opened. 

Then there's why he left. He came into the store acting funny, staring off at a bag of dog food for a literal 5 minutes, before the assistant manager told him to go home. He seemed like he was high and apparently sat in his car for a good two hours after being told to go home and sleep it off. The assistant manager said he came back into the store after those two hours to, ""Use the bathroom,"" and then just left. The assistant manager found a red envelope afterwards with his keys inside and a note that said, ""I quit,"" with his name signed at the bottom. 

After he quit, we did inventory and our stock was super off on certain brands of dog food; on hands would say we'd have 10 bags when we only had 3. There was a guy he knew that came in the store and was always tight on money, so it's believed he was giving them away without payment. One thing that the managers finally addressed was the former keyholder would be at the store for over an hour after we close, when most of us get out of there in 15 mins. I also learned then that he blamed me for a lot of shit that could have gotten me fired if they weren't understanding and hadn't asked for my side of the story. 

Four months after he quit, I ended up with his position so that was a plus. I've now been there the longest other than the store manager and assistant manager, and I've been told on more than one occasion that I get more shit done since the last guy."

halloween,fhv4l09,t1_fhv243g,1581893302.0,"Like I said in the response I made, it essentially looks better in person. It's hard to photograph at the angle it is on my arm which is probably why it looks bad; let alone, me photographing it myself. The guy has done all my tattoos, every single one. I also had it done yesterday so it's swollen from it being on a sensitive part of my skin so the lines probably look worse than they actually are. On top of that, it was a design based off of a patch; I told him, I wanted to keep the exact shape of the coffin, the scythe, and the scroll with the words. There were two roses on the coffin in the original design, so I had him take them out and instead wanted them coming from behind the coffin. I told him to let loose on the rest because I trust him. 

In the end, it matters whether or not I like it as it's permanently embedded in my skin. Like I said, I'll post a picture when it heals and probably have someone else photograph it under better lighting.

If you want to see the other work he's done on me, I'd be more than happy to link some pictures of those."
halloween,fhtednd,t1_fht6kt5,1581873616.0,"I've given my artist free reign on almost all of my tattoos. 95% of the linework came from the design I gave him which was an iron on patch I bought at a Hot Topic; it being a patch, it wasn't totally perfect line wise and I was fine with that. The only thing that really didn't follow the linework was the scroll looking a little more ragged than the design, which doesn't bother me. I wasn't expecting it to be perfect, but I still think it looks good despite the flaws. 

Another thing that may make it look wonky is the way I took the photo and the fact that I just got it done yesterday and it's pretty swollen. It's on a weird part of my arm so I had to bend it to show it off in photos, hence why it's taken in two parts. 

Like I said, despite the flaws, I like it. It'll look better once it heals up, but I was excited to show it off."

With how low and done I was, I could very well be dead right now if I had stayed in that situation. He's told me before he wouldn't have given me his number (we met at my former workplace) if he hadn't of been drinking that night, but I'm thankful he found me. He tells me I saved him too so it makes our relationship that more meaningful to me.

For me personally, even avoiding the county I'm from hasn't stopped me from seeing the ex around completely. I work in the city I used to live in (the one where I went to school and ran away to after the incident with the ex), and make a 40 min commute because no one pays better in my area. My ex essentially lives between the city and the county we grew up in so he sometimes comes to the city and I see him pass in the parking lot and it's a bit hard to hold my composure then. My bosses know what happened and he's banned from the store I work for since he does come around sometimes and he did back me into a corner at one point not long after I started working there two and a half years ago; he hasn't came in the store since thankfully. 

That's the thing with small towns though, too many people know each other. When I still lived up there, in all honestly, if I got in trouble, my dad would know within 15 mins even if he was on the other side of the county at work."

TalesFromRetail,f8se894,t3_e1xytt,1574778389.0,"I dealt with a policy like this at my previous job at a shoe store; we weren't allowed to lock the door until the customers were gone though. It was a Sunday, my ex was coming to pick me up to get me dinner and he was getting irritable to the point he almost left me there. Customers came in five minutes before the store closed, we finished cleaning duties and I was walking around straightening boxes. I asked the customers multiple times if they needed help and they had shoe boxes strewn everywhere by that point. It was 30 mins after close. 

As my ex was throwing his arms up at me in the parking lot with a look that said, ""What's the deal?"" I finally got fed up, walked up to the customers and informed them that we had closed 30 mins beforehand and if they needed any help to let me or my coworkers know. They dropped everything they were trying on and practically darted out the door, leaving a mess. I would have been chewed out for losing whatever chance of a sale we had at that point by my store manager, but it was just a keyholder I was working with. She gave me a look that essentially said, ""Thank you,"" and told me that I could leave because she saw how irritable the now ex boyfriend was being outside.

Edit: Someone commented, but it didn't show up for me. He's the ex for a lot of reasons. I just remember that day so well I had to put it in the story."
AskReddit,f8scocr,t3_e1we7p,1574777130.0,"Not my current relationship, but my previous one. I was madly in love with him at one point, but he wasn't the nicest person in the world. He was emotionally and physically abusive towards me and had gaslighted me into thinking I couldn't find anyone better. I was afraid to be alone as well so I stayed and suffered; I was diagnosed with PTSD earlier this year because of what I endured for four years. 

The only reason I left is because I met my current boyfriend and after hanging out with him for only a few days, I realized I could find better, and I didn't have to go through the pain that I did. I didn't have to deal with being hit or berated constantly. We've been together for two and a half years next week, and I swear sometimes that I love him more than I ever did my ex."
QuittingJUUL,f8bnyl7,t3_dzy8fr,1574441311.0,"I've went through kinda of the same thing. Smoked cigs for like a year, switched to the Juul for seven months and it was breaking the bank for me; with cigs, I'd go through less than a pack a day, with the Juul, I couldn't put it down so I'd go through a pod and a half a day. I successfully quit for four months, and then got super stressed one day and back in August, bought a pack of cigarettes, haven't quit again since though it's been a debate in my mind for a while. 

My biggest problem I had in those four months was I'd get chest pains pretty awful to the point where it felt like I couldn't breathe on occasions. My doctor passed it off as acid reflux, though I'd never had issues with it beforehand. When I started smoking again, the chest pains went away.

raisedbynarcissists,f7m1iqy,t1_f7m02j9,1573852492.0,"Honestly I took to Facebook due to how broken down I've been feeling. I wanted someone I knew to understand what kind of torment has been going on in my head. 

The only reason her and I have had this serious of a falling out this time is due to her being kicked out of her house seven months ago. I took some of her non-important stuff on the terms that she'd get her stuff back when she was taking her medication again (because she stated to me when I came and got her stuff that she was off of them again) and she had to have her own place. She's living with her uncle who isn't making her pay rent so her disability checks are just going to cigarettes and things that she doesn't need. She's been saying she's going to get a car as well for the past 7 months (also has to do with why she was kicked out of her house), but I have yet to hear of that. I refuse to drive over 1.5 hours to bring her that stuff if she's going to be in her angry manic phase like she is when she's off her meds. 

Even after she sent the text that I mentioned in the context, I wasn't planning on texting her back. She always asks me what I want for Christmas and I never get anything because she always ""forgets"" or ""doesn't have the money."" The last text I got from her three months ago was her pouting and trying to guilt me into bringing her stuff to her when I told her no because she hadn't met the terms that I set. 

I'm 21. She's 45. My life is more put together than hers and I told her when we started talking again two years ago that if she messed up again, she was gone from my life for good. I can't put up with it anymore so it's definitely going to be no contact until she proves that she can be a decent human being, which I doubt will ever happen."

TalesFromRetail,f5x00q3,t3_dpkvxw,1572533300.0,"This is a story that one of my old co-workers at a shoe store told me. It happened about 6 months before I started working there. 

One day, they found a small child sitting on one of the benches by herself. She couldn't have been any older than 2 or 3. There was nobody in sight and when my former coworker approached her, he could tell that she was scared and alone. My former manager sat next to her, trying to ask her questions about what her parents names were or maybe some slim chance that she knew a phone number, but the child was too young and didn't understand what was going on. My former manager gave the girl some toys out of the lost and found bin that we had in the back and sat in the office with her for about an hour before they realized that no one was coming to claim her; that's when they called the police. 

Another hour mins go by. No one still shows up, the cops are on their way with a social worker when the family finally comes back in trying to take her with them, but my coworkers honestly weren't letting them. The couple had other kids with them so it wasn't a case of the parents just being out and forgetting that they didn't leave their children with a babysitter. 

I don't exactly remember how the story ended, but I think social services ended up taking in the child and the parents were questioned by police about why they left their child abandoned in a store for so long. That child would be around 5 or 6 now so I hope everything turned out okay for her."

She could do no wrong essentially so she got away with a lot of stuff without consequences. That's how it became the raging fire that it's become today.

The people she is living with act no different than she does with the drinking, partying, and drugs. I know there are kids already living in that situation from the pictures I've seen and I pray every day that they're okay.

Three years later, when the senior trip was announced for my sister and stepbrother's class, it was a three day trip to Disney World. My parents couldn't afford to pay for one ticket, let alone two, so both of them missed out.
