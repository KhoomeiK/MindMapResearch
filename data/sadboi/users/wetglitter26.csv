Veterans,fa8zfkb,t3_e7xv0f,1575858507.0,"I’ve been committed 4 times. Once was a residential program while I was still active duty. It was a program for other active duty. These past 3 times were standard psych ward stays. I just got out actually last night. It sucks. I can’t lie to you. Residential programs tend to be better because you’re there long term. Short term places like wards tend to be a little more sucky but you should still go. 

Why? It’s safe. That’s the bottom line. Also, I can’t speak for the facility where you are but, where I am they have a team of doctors and social workers who communicate with the VA and whoever to make a plan with you on how to be successful. They can put you on medication and monitor you while you’re there should you have any side effects. If you’re going to have side effects to new medication, the ward is the safest place to experience that. If you’re going to talk about difficult things and have a reaction, the psych ward is the place to do it. There’s groups and nurses. I’ve made life long friendships with people I’ve met in the ward. If you’re not doing well to the point you think this is a viable option please go. They will help you find outpatient options to utilize once you leave. Maybe you can get hooked up with a residential program. Those are life savers. 


I wish you the best of luck and I’m sorry you’re struggling right now. Be gentle with yourself and let people help you."
BipolarReddit,fa8u5ov,t1_fa8hwsg,1575854785.0,Yeah and my husband and I had a huge talk. I’m wondering if people can understand why I wouldn’t want to have the child. Because right now he’s saying I’m fucked up. But I know I’m not stable enough but I do suppose I can give birth and give him custody while I figure my life out. Idk. I feel like a horrible person and a horrible mother.
