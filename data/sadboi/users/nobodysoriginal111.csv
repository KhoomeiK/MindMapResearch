This reminds me of when I was 9 years old and was with my mom & grandma at a fish store. I wore a pair of jean shorts that I bought fairly recently at the time. I’m looking at the snacks near the register, waiting for my mom & grandma as they check out some stuff and the cashier dude who was maybe in his late 20s-early 30s says to my mom , 
“Hey is that your daughter?” 
My mom says yep. 
I look over because they’re talking about me, then he gives me a once over and I feel really, really uncomfortable.
Then he asks,“How old is she?”
And my mom says I’m just 9 years old.
His voice is all disappointed but he’s looking at me really weird and he says,
“Too bad. Are you sure she’s not 18? Those shorts really bring out those nice legs.”

I don’t remember how my mom and grandma reacted but since that day they never shopped there again (the store closed down like months afterwards) and I’ve never worn jean shorts ever again, like I just feel really gross whenever I try to wear them so I just don’t."

The best advice I could give is to just focus on your job and keep a polite & professional disposition and distance from those sort of people. Don’t talk behind anyone’s backs (especially to other coworkers) and just keep a notebook at home to jot down anything that happens during your work(so if things go south, you have evidence to back up your claims if you report to the HR department.)
If you have problems, talk to a trusted family member or a friend who has NO relation to your workplace.

Always keep your personal life and work life separate at all costs."

She’s unreasonable for getting angry at you for not meal prepping or whatever when you have the right to do what you want on sundays. It’s not that serious of an issue tbh.

And OP may not care about mass and stuff but knowing that his GF takes her religion seriously then just calling it “leisure” is kinda messed up. It may not sound like a big deal but in the heat of an argument it sounds like you were minimizing her beliefs or something (idk the word) and if it’s a part of her life and something she’s serious about then of course she’d feel offended.

You guys gotta talk it out properly. Need to respect one another fam. Communicate and listen and stuff...speak with your girlfriend properly bro, relationships are a learning process. And if you guys can’t get over this stuff and argue more in the future, maybe it’s time to re-evaluate your relationship idk."

I’ve been trying to do mantras in my head, and trying to distance my emotions from the situation, just all this stuff I searched online. It kinda works, but I’ve only started doing it yesterday so idk.

Ignoring it is one of the difficult things to do, but I try to avoid my most horrible coworkers and only interact with them when they interact with me.

For talking to a higher up, probably when my training period is over idk.

I do want to quit but that really is a last resort, a very tempting last resort when dealing with toxic people.
