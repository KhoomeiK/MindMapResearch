HealthAnxiety,fqg55y0,t3_gipjab,1589338204.0,"Hi! I can try to help. I think we're in the same boat. When I don't feel well, my thoughts get irrational and consuming. And when I get that way, I don't pay attention - I don't listen, I forget, silly things like the right word for something. Someone can be talking to me and I'll not hear them at all. It's exhausting. And it's bc my head is too filled with the irrational health thoughts.

I'm there now, and the pandemic doesn't help. Whether we think we're okay or not, things are still off in the world and that's okay - it's ok to feel stressed. Be kind to yourself. Let yourself have sensations without assigning them as symptoms of something (learned this from a reddit user recently!)"
PMDD,fpmbbe5,t3_ge7anq,1588729391.0,"I'm right there with you. It's a terrible feeling because you do feel physically drained and that feeds your anxiety and you really do think...this is it. I will never feel like myself again. It happens to me one more day on my heavy day once I start, and drinking a lot of water helps my energy levels."
Anxiety,fp4gr8u,t1_foqdk2d,1588298702.0,This is really insightful and well put.
Anxiety,fmr2bc9,t3_fwr14s,1586312240.0,"I've been feeling this exact thing on and off for several weeks! Agree about cool showers vs hot ones. The colder water hurries you up and I tend to focus on that. It's not a fun manifestation of anxiety, but you're in good company."

[Here it is!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08384KZMP)

Claire Patterson loves her family, but sometimes she feels like they hold her back. It isn't fair that she doesn't get to do all the things every one else does, especially her sister Meredith. On Christmas Eve, Claire decides to take control of her world ‚Äì at the expense of a family Monopoly tradition and her sister's chin.

Empowered by the awkward incident, Claire has the motivation she needs to start making her own choices just as she meets Michael Crum, a young man (11 years younger than her, to be precise) who is just like her. A young man who opens up her world.

""I'll Dance At Your Wedding"" is a funny and real look at what it means to be different. And how one family's growing pains make way for two individuals to start feeling like they belong."

It's a photo of the couple's photo shoot - the photographer is hidden behind a post. I got married six months ago, and ever since, I've been eager to see if I can find out who this couple is and get this picture to them ‚Äì thought they might appreciate this angle. Thanks!"
relationship_advice,erg2r6l,t3_c1wi3z,1560824755.0,Walk away. You seem like you're in a good place now after a rough start. Don't let someone else bring this kind of drama into your space. You know the right thing to do. Good luck!
relationships,ep0531a,t3_btjmgq,1558970745.0,"OP, I can't add anything else to this that others haven't already as far as the financial disaster this is. Just please don't set yourself on fire to keep your parents warm. Please update us on the situation. 

Also...remember that No is a complete sentence. Repeat repeat repeat. And if people don't take no for an answer, walk away or hang up the phone. You are absolutely allowed to do that."
nosleep,eozpctr,t3_btkvkl,1558964305.0,Oh man. I loved waking up and drinking my morning coffee to this. I still don't believe or trust anyone.
