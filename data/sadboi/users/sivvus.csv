wowthanksimcured,foiyw13,t1_foiotks,1587801841.0,"I disagree. Your brain does not scream at you just to avoid healthy cures. It’s not trying to sabotage you; it’s trying to find coping strategies which may or may not be productive. I exercise, ear and sleep well and my brain rarely screams at me not to engage in healthy behaviour. I have a healthy life... apart from having severe psychotic breaks and bipolar hallucinations. For those I take pills and have therapy. Saying we have symptoms because our brain “prevents you from taking the advice” is false and frankly insulting. 

What is true in essence is that healthy habits can and do help those coping strategies, but the way you phrased it makes it sound like you don’t know what you’re talking about. I think you need to rephrase your post and you’ll be fine."

goodideas,fo5vkwz,t3_g5mtfe,1587537117.0,"Different systems already use different letters (eg German notation uses B and H to avoid Bb). However, as the poster above me said, musical notation has been revised and refined over the years to be as simple as possible. The fact that each letter is only used once is so important that double flats and sharps have been used to continue it in more atonal/modal music. 

Remembering accidentals on scales is not difficult. At all. Look up “circle of fifths”. 

Second, making a larger letter scale would mean you’d also have to make the stage much taller. Look up old medieval staves for examples of how ridiculously confusing that is. 

Tl/dr: not a good idea."

[this is the mandala ](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/jacaranda-cal) ... keep going until you get to a line you want to stop at. So I stopped after the hearts. 

Mark off enough of the circle to fit across your back to *under* your arms (not across the shoulder) (so maybe 50cm) - don’t crochet onto those stitches. Keep going back and forth in the other stitches in granny or whatever stitch you like for a few rounds. Mark off the middle point of your 50cm and put a granny corner into the opposite, active stitch. That makes the “train”. Keep going until it’s basically an underarm wrap. 

For the sleeves, crochet a chain and then make it into an X with two other chains. I used a mannequin for this to make sure the stitches didn’t twist: work in small circles around the new “arm hole” to make the chains into thicker straps."
