acne,fr36g9t,t1_fr2ke3i,1589850900.0,"Given your skin condition, you absolutely should consider medications if prescribed by a doctor. They know what they’re doing. You wouldn’t be prescribed anything without blood work which sounds like is the next best step for you. Bloodwork will help you get to the bottom of this to start. I found out I was allergic to dairy, gluten, cane sugar, and high fructose corn sugar. My doctor said it takes the body 6-9 months of absolutely *no* allergens to see an improvement and help get it out of your system. Just in case you do find out you have some food allergies, don’t get discouraged if you have no results within a few weeks or couple months, it takes at least 6 months of the right routine and eating habits to see a remarkable difference. Also, excess weight means excess hormones. I noticed in another comment you said you’ve suffered from obesity. Getting yourself down to a healthier weight range can help your hormones balance. *It Goes Without Saying* that weight loss is not easy, but factually loosing weight drastically reduces inflammation in the body. It might be a few components triggering this acne, but I’d encourage you to work with your doctor and follow their medical advice to help you out."

To speak to #3) I also agree that socially in that moment he’s feeling buzzed, and is enticed by 2 women making out in a hot tub. It *could* be ‘just’ that. However, I think his repulsion within himself is the fact that since it ended up being his daughter, he realized that on some deep subconscious level he was attracted to her, at least out of the context of their regular family dynamic (like being a ‘stranger’ at a pool party). I think it disturbed him, and it also touched on this insecurity and fear he has about being constantly attracted to newer, younger women. And has a lot to unpack about himself cheating in the first place, and then being attracted to his student, and his publicist. While we all know it’s normal to be attracted to others in our life, it seems to kick up a moral dilemma within Noah. Hence him talking to about what makes these men he writes about ‘great and exciting’. This I feel was revealed more so in his therapy session with Cynthia Nixon. Can’t remember her characters name in the show.

And while it was traumatic for Noah to realize the young woman he is lusting over from afar was his daughter, it’s more traumatic for her. I think that scene makes a point to expose a deeper troublesome issue in our society of  how very young women have to deal with the inappropriate nature of much older men, and it was also just showing the total terror from the daughters perspective, as any female would have. Noah has this insatiable sexual appetite throughout the show, and even his daughter disturbingly cannot escape it."

It’s that overwhelming *elation* that your partner is finally showing you that attention (passion/ sex/ desire), that is a typical dynamic of an unhealthy relationship. 

It’s unhealthy because there is that much of a *lack* or *absence* of that passion / desire / attention to your needs in the first place. THEN when your partner decides to give you some scraps and show you affection, it’s like a high. That cycle from one end to the other consistently isn’t the makings of a healthy sexual relationship, or relationship in general. 

Your girlfriends tendency to withhold in general can make for a very painful and lonely existence with your partner. You’re still very young and it’s a learning experience to go through a lot of this, but just keep in mind this is *not* an example of how good a great relationship sexually and romantically can be."

As others have mentioned, it’s just something to be aware of that she was drunk while doing this.

Edit: after looking through your post history regarding your girlfriend, I would challenge you to ask yourself whether or not this is a healthy relationship.

Psychologically the children are trying to make sense of rules in 2 different households, which is incredibly confusing for such small children. Add on the spanking and I’m not surprised there are meltdowns often. My marriage and family therapist has suggested that instead of spanking, you ‘remove them from the destructive behavior’, I.E. a time out. There are tons of books on child development at those ages readily available on Amazon, and tons of studies that show spanking is not effective. It’s lazy parenting. My ex believed in it, I did not and all 3 therapists he went to said developmentally it’s not good for children and causes them to act out even more so, which sounds like what’s happening here."

stepparents,foy015r,t1_fowydbo,1588161764.0,"This is kind of stuff that’s on here so often. A lot of time it’s the stepmother that’s ostracized as the outsider because the dysfunctional family unit doesn’t want to accept a hard truth about their family i.e. themselves. However as my marriage and family therapist used to tell me when I was daughter with my ex and his daughter and ex wife: too bad. Those adults owe it to that 12 year old. There’s a lot of people that don’t ‘like’ therapy because they are Scared To Death to confront any feelings etc, but as long as your partner is in a *relationship* with you, and you are caring for his kids, your opinion and needs matters. 

I would tell your partner that therapy needs to happen. If all the emotionally challenged adults resist it this poor child getting help the help he needs, realize that you the stepparent cannot change, fix, or help this broken family dynamic on your own. It’s beyond you and any of our control. I would have think deeply about your role if they keep refusing help or to address their now separated family. 

Something my therapist suggested at the time was for my partner to hire an after school babysitter. Because me taking on a caretaking role was too overwhelming for his daughter (who was 11 at the time). It was causing a lot of issues for her, and then for me who she would retaliate against. My boyfriend did it for about a month, and it actually improved things quite a lot and almost *immediately* de-escalated a lot of tension. My SD had an attitude flip and was actually excited to see me when I was over there just to go out to dinner with and her dad. 

The other point there is that as stepparents we aren’t *responsible* for being nanny’s. Many of us are caretakers by choice, but don’t forget that it is not our responsibility. Taking a step back is what’s needed sometimes. My boyfriend then ended up being resentful it was working and he had to pay money for a babysitter. He wanted someone he could have sex with and take on a 2nd super mommy role so the babysitter was short lived sadly. Lots more to add there, but shorter story is if they refuse a therapist, a babysitter a few days a week once shutdown is over could possibly work wonders."

PinkpillFeminism,fovbd4q,t1_fouyvwj,1588098481.0,"Agreed, at least all the comments are rightfully saying he’s TA. He should be embarrassed to post what he did lol."
BadMUAs,fovab7v,t3_g9nsx0,1588097988.0,"It’s ridiculous, she clearly has nice skin and doesn’t need all of that"
DeadBedrooms,fosvaqz,t1_fosohf8,1588038781.0,"Single life could be much better because you’ve proven already (and you’ve proven to yourself) to be *extremely* capable, resourceful, and clearly a survivor. If you lived in a cheaper apartment would it be worth not having to mother your partner and endure all of that emotional labor? There’s also... *a roommate* as an option if it is a cost thing. 

You also have to recognize that being single again would not be forever. You’d be doing it to heal, work on your self- limiting beliefs, and then to eventually FIND a better more mature boyfriend for yourself. 

Kindly, my hunch is despite the clear dysfunctionality and huge cost of this relationship (to your well-being), you may  have just as many excuses as to why you’re staying with him, as he has for not stepping up. It’s a textbook codependent relationship. So far you’re the only one that’s able to feel the imbalance here and realize it’s a problem which is a huge first step. I would challenge you to really ask yourself *why* you don’t think you could possibly find someone else better (when you clearly have so much to offer in a relationship)? Why you couldn’t break up with him, and then get a roommate if it’s about the finances? Why do you feel ultimately your *own* well-being is worth sacrificing to this degree? That even though your life might have been rough before, that this life your living now is as good as it’s going to get?? Was there a part of your childhood that taught you relationships mean suffering and enduring, VS. growth peace and happiness. Maybe it didn’t, and you had excellent examples of what healthy love is, but either way, you have been way too tolerant, and he’s taken advantage whether he realizes it or not. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship."
DeadBedrooms,fosluv8,t1_fosjq9s,1588033275.0,"I understand but you are *only* 29. When you’re 35, you’ll still be a young person. And at 40, you are certainly not considered anywhere near old yet. Do you really think you can’t find someone better in your 30’s?? How do you want to live the rest of your very long life that’s left?? Our 20’s are not all we get in life, Thank God! The 20’s are the first decade of *semi* adult hood for a lot of people. There is no, no, no way that ship has sailed for you. People find amazing partners at any stage in life. 

The reality of your experience is in the past, and your future is not your past. You cannot ‘live’ in your past in that regard. The part of you that thinks that you can find a much better relationship is the healthy logical part that has self worth. Life is long but also too short, and we only get to do it once, at least from what we remember. Don’t waste even another year with this guy. It will be hard but 1 year after being single from him you will feel like an entire different person. I promise you."
DeadBedrooms,fosl0zs,t1_fosfxng,1588032800.0,Agreed. It will be a long road if she thinks she can change him. She’s already tried asking for what she needs and it’s not happening. Time to move on.
DeadBedrooms,fosk68c,t1_fos83wl,1588032310.0,"Very, very well said. If you insist on staying in this relationship (my vote though is you do not), support him through therapy and diagnostic testing *only*, but STOP supporting him in a caretaker role. You can let him know lovingly but firmly, “I’m no longer going to help you out like I’ve been doing, as if I am a mother to you. At the very least you know I’ve tried talking to you about this before, and you know it’s bothered me. It’s taken a huge toll on me so I’m going to stop doing XYZ. I will however happily support you in trips to a therapist, or psychiatrist, or couples counseling.”"
DeadBedrooms,fosj0hz,t1_foscgqc,1588031655.0,"Girl it WILL. You still have your whole life ahead of you to find a partner that carries their weight and is *happy* to be reciprocal. This relationship IS. NOT. IT. Thinking no one else will be attracted to you has nothing to do with how attractive you are, it has to do with self worth and having confidence, confidence that you can find a better relationship (everyone on the planet struggles with this, but it’s recognizing it to a degree so you don’t self sabotage). 

If you subconsciously believe this is all you deserve, you will continue to waste your youth, and not live up to your highest good. This relationship is also holding *you* back from finding a really awesome person whose right for you. In a harmonious relationship there is not an extreme power imbalance like this. You deserve to have a mature, loving relationship where you are not mothering your partner. Again I’ve been there, so I’m here to tell you life goes on, and so does the option to meet *tons* of other men who would be a better fit."
DeadBedrooms,fosashj,t1_fos88zb,1588027103.0,"No it’s nothing you *can* or *cannot* do. The sad thing is, other than asking (which you’ve done already, clearly and concisely) you cant influence his behavior. It’s only up to HIM to act on it. From this post it genuinely sounds like your describing your frustrations with one of your children. Any female on the *planet* would not be sexually attracted to their partner who takes 0 initiative in this extreme. Reading your list gave me anxiety as I had to do pretty much everything for my ex and it was exhausting, mentally, emotionally, and physically. It absolutely effected my desire to have sex with him. Honestly what you do for him is wild. Trust me when I say everything your doing **it is too much**. I would take a step back with everything, and let him run his own life, and let the consequences for *his behavior* fall where they may. But truthfully I don’t know if it’s healthy for you to even continue to managing his life to this degree. It’s also not healthy for him. He needs to learn to stand on his own 2 feet, ideally alone for awhile.

I mean truly you have gone above and beyond carrying the relationship and catering to him. I wouldn’t be able to continue a relationship with him anymore. He’s complete lack of awareness and proactive ness with planning and helping would be SUCH a turn off. You can find a guy who will initiate and plan, this guys not it."
JUSTNOMIL,fos5ysn,t3_g946aa,1588024579.0,"Very glad you left. Your future MIL would have been a nightmare, and it looks like your fiancé had *no* desire to form healthy and firm boundaries around his mother. If he couldn’t stand up to her now, he won’t be able to do it then. He showed no signs of getting out of the FOG (fear. obligation. guilt. for anyone new reading this). Nothing would be worse than marrying him and him constantly prioritizing the delusion of his parents (mother in this case)."
stepparents,foldmo0,t1_fol9725,1587859986.0,"Tell him to read Stepmonster for a reality check. Not only has he not nor will *ever* experience what it’s like to birth a baby, (so he should shut up about loving SDs like your own), but the majority of stepparents can acknowledge that there of course is huge major difference between biological children and, someone else’s children."
stepparents,foldd24,t3_g82byu,1587859827.0,"Put down firm boundaries around this because no one else will do it for you. Obviously DH needs to advocate for, re-enforce, and understand these boundaries once you make it crystal clear to him that you will need time to focus on your brand new baby. 

A newborn will require 24/7 100% of your undivided attention, physically that’s what necessity for them to survive. DH will also need to be available for his new child as well. So hopefully people will understand that but it they don’t truly ignore them. You need to do what’s best for YOU and your new baby. Tell DH hell need to figure out child care when necessary when SK is born. Don’t back down on this, you are right here."

MoneyDiariesACTIVE,fojs2jd,t1_fojixsi,1587828198.0,"I hear you and I understand. My part time job for the past 4 years has been in Social Work, and my experience is that most of my clients sadly are extremely disadvantaged and the ones who would actually *be* the first to go to college, get a decent job, are incredibly incredibly rare. It takes a lot to overcome the system of the and it’s not the norm for a lot of people. As a white woman whose had access to great jobs and education, and currently has a great full time job in real estate, yeah I’ve ‘worked hard’ but at the end of the day I’m privileged and extremely lucky compared to a different demographic. When I was in my early 20’s I had a small world view of how other populations *truly* existed until I get into social work, even though like many people in their early 20’s (oh those were the days!) I thought I was super experienced. I now work with young adult women as well and they’d have no way to relate to the the popularized young millennial professional like on Money Diaries. Now at 31 I admit and realize that my 23 year old self had a lot to learn lol. I *am* a hard worker, and it still took a lot of schooling and effort to get career going in corporate real estate, but... I also have been extremely privileged growing up. I also believe young women in general should be helping each other to get these high paying positions, just like men have always done. Men still get paid more and that’s another inequality."
MoneyDiariesACTIVE,foipvvr,t1_foipaas,1587793264.0,"Yeah for sure. I think sharing some background or just simply answering those types of questions when asked, is in *total* spirit with this sub that goes AGAINST the sexist rhetoric women have been conditioned to ‘never talk about money’. I consider myself a financial feminist in that sense, and truly believe that women should be building each other up encouraging and mentoring each other to get these high earning positions just like men have always have. Historically, socially, there have always been the notion of ‘an old boys club’. Men have *always* had that advantage; mentoring, discussing, and grooming each other to excel and be successful in high paying elite positions. 

Women on the other hand, have no equivalent of a ‘old boys club’ in the business world. MD is a great step in changing that I feel."

MoneyDiariesACTIVE,foip40d,t1_foiemlw,1587792608.0,"“Have the choice” is what some of those who don’t see or experience the realities of the various socioeconomic systems will think. Good choices aren’t necessarily how a lot of people with huge societal, demographic, and economic barriers look at their ability to become educated, and find a career that pays above the national average."
MoneyDiariesACTIVE,foioq77,t1_foi048i,1587792283.0,"I think the resounding interest is *how* high income earners, got their high income. The high income diaries are just not a reflection of the average young working woman, sadly. Those that are fortunate enough to have really high earning positions should be more willing to share their career path / background etc. for other aspiring women in that field."
MoneyDiariesACTIVE,fohnqza,t3_g7i3yk,1587769131.0,"Also agreed. I live in a HCOL area and many of my very smart female friends are not making over $100,000 under 30 years old. $100,000+ at 24 is certainly NOT THE NORM."
MoneyDiariesACTIVE,fohnjxo,t1_fohmkgq,1587769020.0,"lol agreed, and generously they never want to share *how* they got their job, which for a bunch of other aspiring young women they could afford to share some job searching tips or advice if other women want to get into the same field."

A lot of men *act* and project like they are entitled to sex. Even though they might never consciously admit it. Safety however is a human need for both women and men.
