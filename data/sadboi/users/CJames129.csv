addiction,fk48xhx,t3_fgbj7w,1583855720.0,"This post hits me..  
I’m always amazed by people today still wanting to try heroin, which btw, will most likely not even be heroin but some form of fent which has a very real chance of ending the life of someone without a heavy tolerance.  It’s kinda like flagging down a pickup truck full of inbred hillbillies and asking them to shoot apples off your head.
When I came into opiates, it was all over (Oxy 20s, 40s and 80s), they were everywhere here around this time (‘99 ish) and they were real, not pressed who knows what.  We were told they weren’t really addictive and honestly, how bad could they be??  They’re tiny!  Surely, nothing that terrible can come from such a small pill, right?  Just a fun time at a party.  We were very, very wrong.  I had 6 very close friends at that time and now I’m the only one still above ground.  Here’s the thing, we all just wanted to try it, none of us planned to ever become junkies.   I had tried most available drugs by this time with the exception of meth and crack because well, those were seriously “hard” drugs that you’d sell your soul for and I was a college student who had ground rules.  These pills were prescribed by doctors, they weren’t hard drugs, they were cuddly and came in bright colors; yellow, orange and blue, like Fruit Loops!
I’d never had any problem with any substance, I could take them or I could leave them, no sweat.
Then I tried OxyContin and my life changed forever.  I’ll never forget the night because it was Christmas Eve, 1999, I was 19 with the world in my hands.  2000, here we come!!  I was at a friends house, the same best friend’s house that I spent every Christmas Eve in since I was 10 but they were never the same ever again after this one in ‘99.  Within a year, I’d be in rehab for IV heroin use.  Cut to 5 years later and this same home I tried my first OC in on that Christmas Eve was were my best friend took his last breath.  His mother found him around 7am blue and long gone.  Maybe a year or so later, his father took his own life in the same finished basement by the bar and pool table.  I went on to struggle for a little longer before finally getting clean.
So to answer your question OP, yes, I do believe there are people out there who can try heroin once and never touch it again.  Nobody I knew was able to pull it off but I’m sure that person exists.  Here’s the thing though, you could be like me, someone who never had any drug issues until I tried it.  The best way to describe it for me the first time was like I was allowed entry into heaven for 6-8 hours.  And there’s the issue, you don’t NOT go back to heaven.  You visit frequently until those pearly gates erode and you realize you’re actually in purgatory at best.  Why risk this, why ask for another demon to try to control?  It’s just not worth it, it’s cliche and likely a 2Pac lyric but you can’t miss what you never had, why try something that if you enjoy, you may always want?  This seems extremely ignorant to me especially given the shit show that has been the opioid epidemic over the last 20 years being played out every day.  There’s children everywhere with both parents dead and buried with nobody to take care of them.  Toddlers trying desperately to wake their mother who just fell out in Walgreens.  Cars ghost riding down neighborhood streets cause the driver flopped and the car has yet to plow into something that’s solid enough to stop it.
People can no longer claim ignorance, the dangers are known now, I never knew the road those tiny pills would take me down, you do now, everyone does.  I like to think had I known I would have never tried it, who knows though, young people are morons.  No offense, I was a moron as well, still am.  I dunno, nobody is likely to listen to some old head on the Internets, I never would have but I wish someone tried so that’s what I feel obligated to try and do.
Please, anyone thinking of trying heroin, just don’t.  Not because it’s bad but because it’s utterly amazing and nothing the entire rest of your life is going to measure up.  Wedding day? First born??   Yeah, good but they’re not heroin..  Why invite something so obviously devious into your life?  If you don’t care about your life at all right now, I get it, life sucks sometimes still don’t try it.. wait because things change fast and in 5 years you could be somewhere amazing doing great things or you could be strung out somewhere thinking to yourself, “I remember when I thought life sucked, man, if I only knew.”"

So a few years ago, the VA put me on Lexapro and it worked for awhile and I felt generally more calm and “normal” but this was fairly short lived and there were a lot of other side effects as well that I wasn’t in love with, so after about a year, I decided to wean myself off, this was in 2017.  I don’t really trust pharmaceuticals and have a “rough” history with them so I’ve been just living with it and trying to deal.  I started to see a lot of talk about md’ing psilocybin so I started to look into it and I notice that about .15 gs has a similar effect on my mood as the Lexapro with absolutely none of the negative side effects.  I’m almost unable to perceive that I’ve even taken anything but I have a better outlook on these days.  I think that’s kinda what this is good for, you’re not going to experience anything profound and I’d imagine that someone with zero mental issues (a robot?) could find it somewhat pointless but I can definitely tell a difference on these days.

They’re saying people on K need to re-dose every 6 months or so where many of the people experiencing depression relief from shrooms seem to be getting there from one or two trips.  Google Johns Hopkins psilocybin trials.  Pretty amazing stuff.

If you’re serious, you’re serious and it’s a matter of life and death.  That’s where you have to be for recovery to work.  Lots of people say things like, “I don’t wanna be flagged or have anything in my medical file about being a recovering addict.”  I personally never understood that mindset because that’s exactly what I am.  If you’re holding onto shame or can’t come to terms with what you are or you’re worried about being flagged in some way, I kinda question the commitment involved.  If you’re serious about recovery, nothing matters more, not flags in a file, not shitty judgmental looks from medical “professionals”.. nothing.

They still make outstanding products but they’re no longer on the bleeding edge.  I wish they were."

They’re a pretty small company and shipping/email correspondence isn’t necessarily what they specialize in.   You’ll get your order and they will respond to emails but at their time, not ours.  The good news is not a whole lot of after sale support is needed, they’re simple and pretty much indestructible unless you’re a serious gorilla.

addiction,fgq8tdq,t1_fgq4sax,1581020002.0,"Exactly.  Nobody can say with any certainty what happens after this life, here’s the thing though, let’s say it is over after this, not even eternal blackness, just nothing, nothing is less than blackness.  It’s nothing and blackness is something.  
I don’t recall 1920 no memories, no joy or fear with because I was yet to exist on this plane, maybe it’s the same after we’re gone?  I don’t remember or fear 1920 so why would I fear being gone in 2120??  Anyway, I don’t know and neither does anyone else, claiming certainty is somewhat small minded but who knows, these people could have it right...  If 60-70 years (often less) is all we get throughout eternity, shouldn’t we all be trying to make the best of what time we do get?  Seems being overly concerned about the nothingness (that may not even be the case) is a waste of our time while we’re here."

Methadone,fgiy3tr,t1_fghsrrx,1580833332.0,"Don’t worry too much.  There seems to be this belief that “if you taper slowly, you’ll barely feel anything” and that is true for the most part but it’s still difficult and I feel like telling people it’s nothing is doing them a disservice.  You need to have plans in place for how you’re going to deal with difficult days.  My taper was not all that bad, I wouldn’t say it was like eating cake but it was for sure doable.  However, I had been on (and clean from DOC) since May 2005, so I was in a stable situation, hadn’t gotten high in close to 15 years and knew it was time.  That’s just it, I feel like when it’s time, you just know.  If there’s any real doubt, it’s probably not time.  Just knowing that going back out is no longer an option makes things easier.  There was fent in the bags I used to get too but nothing like today and I’m not 20 anymore so I know that getting high legit makes nothing better.  I understand now that whatever problem or feeling I’m having only gets worse if I use.  It’s just no longer an option for me.  I have zero cravings to use, I honestly don’t even think about it.  
Where I struggle is with depression sometimes but that’s just my life, I know heroin will not improve any of that, so in some ways it’s easy because it’s just not an option.  I didn’t get to this place overnight though, we’re talking 15 years of MMT.  
If I can tell you some of what I’ve learned along the way I’d say; you for sure can do this, it may be difficult at times but so is life, certain things are always going to be difficult, it’s never going to be completely struggle free.  If you make up your mind that you want off and you’re at a place where relapse is no longer an option, you can def do it.  Another thing I would say, is don’t take anyone else’s experience as your own.  Just because someone else says this or that, don’t believe it’s 100% going to be the same for you.  Everyone’s body and mind are unique in how they experience different things.  So don’t let my story freak you out, you’re a different person and you’re experience will not be exactly the same as mine.  Lastly, I’ve had success, 7 months off in 3 days and I feel pretty certain that I’ll never abuse opioids again, to me that’s a success story.  I just need to continue to work on my mental health but I’m definitely not alone in this.  Just because I get apathetic/depressed at times, that’s not failure, that’s just life.  
To sum it up, If you’re ready and you’ll know when you are, you can get off.  Rushing is bad though, take your time and don’t necessarily put any time limit on it.  Go slow and get there when you get there.  The people I’ve seen taper because of money or the drive rarely have success.  My treatment was 100% covered, didn’t cost me a dime and I could have stayed on for life for free, the fact that I still wanted off was my sign that it was time to try.  Best of luck. 👍✌️"
Dynavap,fgiq7sd,t1_fghnv41,1580828423.0,"I have the Omni XL (Hydravong) and I have a Simrell as well.  I honestly like them both.  My Simrell wasn’t cheap though at $260 but it’s pretty amazing (Galaxy Burl and Mother of Pearl and Abalone rings (why it was $260)).  It’s pretty amazing and the craftsmanship is next level but I’m into that so to me it was worth it.  If you’re looking for the best and don’t care as much about aesthetics, the Omni is still one of my favorites.  So in using them, I’d say they’re pretty equal but there’s a slightly different technique with the Vortex and there’s more airflow.  Nobody else will have a Vortex just like mine so to me it was worth the extra cash but I wouldn’t say it necessarily vapes any better than my Omni."

Also, OP you can usually find a 10% code any time for DynaVap so waiting for 4/20 could save you an additional $18/19 but I’d rather drop a $20 and get it 3 months sooner.  If today were 4/3, I’d probably wait but I wouldn’t wait now to save less than $20.   Things sell out during the sales too."

Methadone,fg4rujl,t1_fg4hyml,1580509720.0,"I got off 8/7/19 and did it the exact way you’re planning on doing it.  It’s fine, you’ll be fine if you really want to do it.  It’s not easy but if you really want to do it, you’ll make it.  For me, the most difficult part has been these last couple months.  I’ll be 7 months off next week and once the excitement of getting off wears off and you’re just back to boring ass life, it can be rough.  That’s my experience anyway.  Physically, I feel fine but I do feel like it takes a very long time for your head to heal.  Methadone really digs in deep, I had serious joint pain for awhile and lately it’s been mostly mental like apathy/depression.  Everyone is different and you may not experience this at all but I wanna let people in your situation know that for me, tapering was pretty easy and staying clean has been easy too because for me, using means I die or want to die but once that newness of tapering off goes away and it’s just life again, you need to have some sort of plan in place to stay clean.  Best of luck, you can for sure do it."
