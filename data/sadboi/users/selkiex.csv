APChemistry2020,fl61ide,t3_fmqcgb,1584851528.0,"Hi, AP Chem veteran here! The Ap chem exam is typically heralded as one of the hardes, and since I’ve taken 5 exams and I’m taking 3 more this year, I believe I can confirm that. The best way to get a 5 is to have bought a review book in January. If you didn’t, you still have time, but you have to grind on studying until your exam. Focus on titrations. That is a big part of the exam— like 50%. Another big one last year was Thermochemistry and Equilibrium. You know, the stuff in the middle of winter break that you might’ve forgotten. I believe online there is a breakdown of material on the test (I.e. 10% of the test is Atomic Theory or something), but I don’t have that for you. The best way to get a 5 is to study everyday and do LOTS OF PRACTICE EXAMS. If your teacher paid for Flinnprep it is extremely helpful to go through their units because they teach you exactly what is on the exam. If not, Khan academy and your review book should have practice. If you need other advice I’m happy to help. And remember: this is an extremely difficult exam, so don’t be too discouraged if you don’t get a 5! Good luck studying!!"

OCPoetry,fhkp35e,t1_fhk5rgt,1581688516.0,"Yeah it’s not a continuous story. It’s supposed to be read as a person telling a story, but slowly losing the thought or giving up. That’s why the last lines are softly softly softly because it’s them dozing off. Additionally, it was a separation of how I think. When I started the allusion to Holy Sonnet X I felt differently than when I wrote creaks and cracks. Finally, poems are supposed to be read out loud. My separation is just to help you understand to pause when I don’t use a punctuation!

OCPoetry,fhjw4dy,t3_f38khh,1581657420.0,"“Bees suck from the flowers, (they scream     
at the bees),”

There’s a sort of madness that I find so relatable in this poem because of your vivid imagery. Your tone is that of extensional horror that I admire so much because my horror is all dull and sad, but this is lively and you are thrown into the scenes. I picked the bee one lines because I have never thought of flowers and bees like that, but that it the relationship they have. Something that it’s supposed to help only stabs and sucks, but since flowers have no brains they cannot fight back and thus they allow it and it spreads their progeny.  I smell the dirt and grass of the poem and I am willing to let the mycelium overtake me. Thank you for this lovely horror."
OCPoetry,fhjvma5,t3_f3irev,1581656969.0,"I really love the imagery (I can just. Feel the lighter in my hand) and nearly frantic energy of this poem. The lighter that one always carries, but never used really reminds me of someone trying to get over a big issue in their life — addiction, trauma, the like — yet they can’t let it go. I too have a lighter in my purse, but it’s not a lighter and it’s not in my purse. Whether you intended on this poem being interpreted like that or not, I got some comfort from hearing that other people do carry the scars of their past, too!"

bulimia,fh1ponc,t3_f0xhmv,1581220590.0,"After a long time, yes. When you eat sugars, starches, carbs— the like— your body produces insulin to combat that. However, when you purge, your body already created all that insulin to break down the carbs and can’t unmake it. So over time, if you abuse this, you can end up with type 2. It’s quite rare but it does happen. 
If you’ve ever felt like headed and like you were going to faint after purging a bunch of sugary food than you know the feeling of overproduction of insulin. I didn’t know about this until my type 1 gf told me that I was literally fucking up my pancreas. I’m not a doctor and neither is she but endocrinology is the field I’m going into.
