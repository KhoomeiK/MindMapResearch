Yet
I told one of my really good friends this, it's like watching a scary movie, and someone walks into the room and sits down next too you, to watch it with you. And then the movie becomes a little bit less scary. 

So, since we are all suffering, let's do this thing together, and maybe our sufferings will lessen or even cease.

I've felt alone for a long long time now, but I am starting to realize, that even when I feel so absolutely alone, we are in this crazy Life and in this fucked up and beautiful world together.

school,eu9sccy,t3_cfa5xr,1563589380.0,"What happens if there is an emergency and you need to contact your parents or family? (You can't remember all of their phone numbers. Plus you might not be able to reach one of the school phones depending on the circumstances of the emergency). What if you need to be picked up from school and need your phone to contact your family or friends? What happens if you are going somewhere after school, but you don't have your phone so you can't tell your parents? What if you don't have your phone for directions, you'll have to resort to paper maps!? What if you have accommodations to take pictures of the blackboard and you need your phone to take pictures?

Banning phones from schools, that is just unreasonable. Plus it seems like a safety hazard (as sad as it is to say we rely on phones for a lot). 

There is a whole generation where technology and phones were the norm. Banning them from school property seems to be a bad idea. This can cause anxiety in students (and in parents, not being able to contact their children). I would agree with phones not being able to be used during school, unless with permission. Maybe even turning off phones during school hours, that would make more sense than banning them. Phone separation anxiety is a real thing. We rely on phones for communication and directions. I think teaching students how to manage phone time, screen time, and how to separate themselves from their phones, that would be much better. But forcing students who have lived with phones their whole life to suddenly not have them, can cause a lot of anxiety in students. It also could be a potential safety hazard as I mentioned before. We have adapted into living with cell phones and technology. Most of us don't know how to be without them.

Teaching students how to function without them, and how to manage and moderate phone, screen time, is a lot more effective and helpful too. Nobody will learn anything if they are forced to stop their phone addiction. They will need to learn how to live with both technology as well as without it. But not like how they are doing it.

I do agree, technology and cell phone usage at the rate it's used, is unhealthy. It also is kind of dangerous, because what if a large solar flare knocks out all our Technology, we will have our economy fail, we will have no idea how to do anything, we'll be lost while driving without a GPS, etc. It's also a nasty addiction. People usually only associate drugs with addiction, but addiction isn't just drugs, it's the way we live and our habitual behaviors. Such as using phones everyday all the time. But it doesn't always work out when an addict is forced to go cold turkey. They usually have a high chance of relapsing when they do this. Same thing with phones, we need to gradually lessen our phone and technology use. In this day and society, we can't live completely without technology, so being abstinent from it wouldn't really be possible for the normal, average, person. But that's okay. We just need to moderate, not force. Encourage, not force. You can't force an addict to stop using really, I mean you can lock them in a jail cell, but more often than not, they will relapse. Students will find ways to sneak in their phones and text or snap chat during class. It won't stop anything by banning phones. 

Well, that's my whole spiel. Moderate and encourage not force and authoratize."

Yeah, I am not sure what posture is best yet. I feel like I meditate better sitting on the floor, regardless if my legs and feet fall asleep. Something about being on the ground, and it helps my back be more straight.

Haha, my dogs and cat add to my meditation too! They help me learn to not be distracted by distractions. Also, my cat will come up and sit in my lap while I meditate sometimes and meditate with me. I like being outside, hearing the wind and birds chirping, it just feels right too me, I don't feel like I am distracted by my thoughts anymore. And just being outside feeling the warmth of the sun and the refreshing breeze of the wind helps me relax.

Sometimes it feels like I need to make amends, but I think that when I feel that, that it's my addict side being selifsh, but the other part me really wants the best for those I've harmed and to help them heal and move on. However, I think that it may just be me lying to myself thinking it's best for them, while really it'll only help me and hurt them.

The people are not as openly friendly as in other places. i.e. You won't necessarily see people in the city walking on the street and saying hi or even looking at you when you walk by. But when you hike up in the mountains on trails and pass someone, they usually say hello, quick how are you, as they pass. 

Our weather is crazy (I think this is because of the mountains) it can go from super warm and nice one moment to raining and cold the next. Or nice and relatively warm to snowing the next.

There are amazing ski resorts, hiking, and biking trails here. Biking is huge here. 

It is really dry here and is at high altitude, so you will have to drink a lot of extra water as a foreigner. (Even as a native I still drink a lot of water).  

A lot of our fruit is shipped into us, because those specific plants cannot survive during the winter. 

Pretty cold winters and can have some nasty blizzards. But the silence that comes when it snows, and the stillness, leaves me breathless. It is one of my favorite things.

Cold rain here too.

It is expensive to live here, but probably cheaper than NZ, depending on where obviously.

We have great universities and community colleges.

The suburbs are really nice too.

Colorado is a lot of plains and then there are the mountains. It is not ever to far to drive to the mountains for the most part.

Things are probably more fast paced here then there. 

Scenery wise and nature wise, Colorado is very beautiful.

Of course we are also progressing towards the legalization of certain psychedelics. Like Psilocybin (decriminalized in the city of Denver only. Or I believe only Denver and not the rest of Colorado), MDMA, and Cannabis (well that is already legal (it is still federally illegal technically, but state wise it is legal, so you run almost a zero percent risk of getting into trouble, unless you do something stupid or drive stoned). This is not why I love Colorado though. Although, I am glad that we are progressing.

Overall I love Colorado. It remains my favorite place that I have been to so far. (I have only ever really been in the states of America, besides when I was really young and do not remember).

I want to see the world and get to experience living in another beautiful country. I was thinking NZ was similar to Colorado, in the sense that the people are laid back and are kind to one another for the most part. That is also part of the reason I want to move there.

Vultures are beautiful creatures. They don't let any resource or energy go to waste. The way they all waited for the bodies to be prepared, it was as if they were showing respect to the humans. (Probably not the case, but it seemed like that). 

I don't know anything about the music or singing, but I found it quite beautiful. They were honoring and showing respect to the lives and deaths of them (or that's my perspective anyway). 

I think it's kind of amusing that humans tend to think about what happens to their bodies after death. We are not going to be aware (assuming) of it anyway. In ways, it's thought about out of respect to other living beings and their families and friends. i.e. What costs the least for their families (emotionally and financially). And what is the best use of energy during the process of their death care.

I see a lot of debating about what is best and worst for the process of bodies when they die. I don't think there is a best or worst methodology. Sky burials are natural and are energy saving. Traditional burials (or traditional in the U.S. at least) help their loved ones let go of them, by letting them see their loved ones one last time. And creamation can be used in the deceased ones wishes, of where to spread their ashes. However, they all have what people might consider negative qualities to them. For instance, people who are not familiar with sky burials might find it disturbing, disgusting, and/or disrespectful. However, the same can be said for creamation and traditional burials. The use of chemicals to preserve the body, the unrecognizable state of the body during creamation. Leaving a body in the ground to rot, etc. . .

I do not think that there is a right or wrong way to treat the dead. They each have their reasons for respect of the deceased and living. They each can be seen as the morally right or wrong way, but there is no morally right or wrong way in my opinion. It is just a choice that we make. That is it. 

I really enjoyed this experience of watching the video. It was very enlightening on the impermanence of us. And how we are just guests in these vessels that we call bodies. 

A lot of us, myself included, forget that we are just guests in these vessels. And a lot of us avoid thinking about the impermanence of everything, especially ourselves; because for some reason (at least where I am from) death is considered a taboo topic. 

This video is a great reminder of our limited visit in this life and the illusion of reality."

That's a pretty awesome experience that you got to experience! I can't remember if I said this, but I used to love playing League of Legends; now I just watch LoL on Twitch. I had sometimes dreamed of becoming a pro or a commentator. I think that's so amazing and awesome that you achieved (I think your dreams).

That is really good advice and very true in my experience, about if you smile and be nice to others that you'll experience more happy and friendly/compassionate people. I think it might have something to do with them feeling like your being more open and welcoming. Perhaps, it also had to do with once you start realizing the good and the kind people, the more you notice that and you don't hold onto or dwell in the negative energy of yourself and others/that others give. 

I definitely believe that there isn't really any good or bad. Like there it's not that black and white. Something bad could lead to something good, and vice versa. And some things have both good and bad qualities. We are shaped by our experiences and the feelings/thoughts that we associate with them, so I think Ultimately that is a positive thing. 

Racism does suck. But, that's just the world we live in. Of course not everyone is racist/discriminative. Most, if not all, have their biases however-- I think that has to do with our environment, empirical experiences, nature, and nurture. Unfortunately, racism is something that most people, if not every different colored person, has experienced before I'm their life. Wanting to feel superior, powerful, authoritative, or pad their ego, is common. I try to understand people who are discriminative and/or racist; but it's hard. I know that it might be how they were raised, or their experiences, but it's hard to see why people are like this. Also, I know everyone has their own shit. The way I see it when it comes to people's shit (I can't remember if I said this) is that there is just shit. There is no good shit or bad shit. Nobody's shit is better or worse than anyone else's shit. It's just shit.

I used to think life wasn't fair. Especially since I've experienced racism first hand, and a bunch of other messed up things. But now, I think it is not necessarily fair or unfair. It just is. We are all given a life and a chance to live, feel, and experience--and that's love right there.

However, as humanity, we can try to bring equality among everyone. 

I think we have a long way to go with humanity. I don't know if I am hopeful for humanity and this planet or not.  There are a lot of positive movements. But a lot of people don't want to change their way of thinking and living. 

I guess all there is to do, is live and love each moment we are experiencing. While, always striving to better ourselves and each other."

spirituality,er48e5e,t1_er44q6t,1560483774.0,"Man, I could relate to a lot of what you are saying. 

To my family and friends, sister included, they lost their son, brother, and friend, for seven years. (That's how long I was using). Started young, quit young (I pray I stay clean too. I have a constant fear of going back out. The further I get away from my using years, the more I forget/feel disconnected from the bad that I did and was. I feel like that person to me is alien. It's hard to explain. I know I did what I did, I can't remember all the bad I did, because there was a lot, I know I was who I was, but the more time passes, the more I feel disconnected and alien too it. Which is not the same for her or anyone else, because to her she sees me as the using me. And I don't know if that will/can ever change.

It scares me so much, because the more alien and disconnected it feels, the more complacent I become. (I don't know if complacent is the right word. I keep working on myself, and avoid situations where I'm tempted to use, but the more forgetful and disconnected I get). I try to remember all the bad I did and how much destruction their was in my life and to others. Because if I don't hold onto that, I know I'll slip.  

There is a lot of trauma my sister has/is going through. I was a really scary person at times when I was using. I never physically hurt anyone, but I would threaten and act out crazy.

My sister once told me, and brought it up in therapy the other day, that she didn't think I would live past 26. I still haven't made it past then yet (21). I definitely do think she still doesn't have faith in me, and doesn't have faith I can stay clean. 

She tells me she gave up on me, because she in her mind, she knows I'll die a using addict. Which makes sense, because I've OD multiple times, more than I can count on two hands, and had to be hospitalized and narcan and all of that. And I did actually did once too, was clinically dead for 10 minutes at one point.

So I know that it must be really difficult for her, to regain he trust and faith in me. I don't know if it can be done, if this damage can be healed. And it saddens me. It also saddens me that she only sees the using me and none of the progress I've made.

Honestly, I don't know if I'd trust myself either. I don't know if I'd give myself a second chance. 

But to me. Life is to unpredictable and to short, to live fighting each other. 

However, sometimes the best thing to do is to let go and move on. (Whether if it's her moving on from me, me moving on from her, or both).

I had/have problems before my addiction though. It's about changing who I am and my actions/behaviors. Which is what I've been working so.... so hard to do. I've come a long way. I've become a lot better of a person. I've grown immensely spiritually. 

That whole situation with your nephew and family sounds really tough. I couldn't imagine a child being involved in this addict lifestyle. 

I've been the only one in my family with a substance problem. So that part is a little hard for me to relate too.

Addiction is like a virus, it spreads so quickly and deadly. I don't even know how many people I turned onto drugs. At the times I just wanted others to experience it with me and be my friend. But looking back, I know I've ruined a lot of people's lives and turned them into addicts.

Addiction is such a nasty disease. 

Thank you so much for your story and for relating with me. That is really helpful, it makes me not feel so alone. Which I feel like I am, because I was/am always the one who has the addiction problem, not them. It's hard to live with an addict though. I can only begin to imagine. 

I am not sure if telling her to cut the bs and ask her to tell me what the real problem is, would be the best idea right now. Just kinda going along with what my therapist suggest as far as that aspect goes. Not sure what to do though."
spirituality,er40unv,t1_er3w5g5,1560478072.0,"Okay, I'll give it a shot.

Communication between my sister and I isn't good right now, actually it's the opposite.

We both play roles in this. I don't always think before I say, and sometimes I say/do things I mean to have with good intentions, but she takes it the wrong way.

I am in recovery from addiction and caused a lot of pain to my sister and to well everyone I came in contact with.

She only sees the past me and only sees my flaws, and is in a place where she refuses to see my progress and/or who I've become. 

We just started therapy together, which is a good thing. But she even said she's not ready, and that she won't ever be ready. 

I have the view that we need to have compassion for everyone and everything. I try to see all the perspectives. At times that is hard though. So I have a view that there is no time to fight or hate one another. 

I know healing takes time, but at the same time I know that everyone has the risk of not being here the next day. We could live for another 70 years, or another second. I take this especially serious, because of my health. The statistics of living a long and normal life after a cardiac arrest is very low. But I know the whole dying soon or later applies to everyone. 

So I believe that everyone should live like that, and try to make an effort and learn how to have compassion for one another.

I am trying really hard, and have been, to fix this relationship and learn to love each other. However, it just feels like she can only see the flaws and the old me who did hurt her, understandably. 

It feels like I am doing the right thing, but sometimes it feels like I am not on the right path and not doing the right thing.

Part of me believes we should all have compassion, and the other part of me wonders when it's time to just let go of my relationship with my sister and move on. 

Everything else in my life feels like I'm doing the right thing. This is the only thing that I am not sure about. It feels right, but it also feels like a fight that I don't know about. I am exhausted with fighting with her, and just it is so exhausting."

Good on you! Yes, confidence is a huge key aspect to relationships. Something I am trying to work on, but currently suck at. I am super awkward and shy.

My therapist wanted me to try to get the horse to come over without talking to it. She said to be calm and imagine I was inviting the horse in visually. I thought this was ridiculous and that there was no way I could make a horse come to me with no words. (I think it has something to do with the heart beats. I don't know. My therapist said something about how a horse has seven times the range of humans to sense heart beats. Or something like that. Do you know what that is or is about?). It took a little while, but I eventually was able to get the horse to come to me. The more I practiced this in therapy, the less time it took to get the horse to come to me each time.

depression,eqsobem,t1_eqqwn42,1560289598.0,"I was thinking about the balance of nature vs nurture the other day, how both play a role in it.

I had two loving parents and a loving sister. They are very sweet and have great mannerisms. I don't know anything and my birth family however, as I was adopted before a year old. 

(I was talking to this with my parents yesterday). Yet, I was a bad/mean kid. I was also sweet and shy at times too though. I got bullied a lot at school for being shy and a different skin color. I had a lot of racist remarks growing up, it still happens very rarely nowadays though. I wonder if, because I was bullied, I'd act out in mean ways because of it (I am not trying to make excuses. I know it's my own doing in the end). When bullies would push me or tackle me, I'd punch back. Which usually made them cry (which I never understood why they would pick on someone if they couldn't take a punch).

My class had a substitute teacher for a year, and we made her cry. I think that most of the kids were really sweet and nice, but at the same time they could all get nasty really fast. 

As for adult hood, do you think most people end up being bad/mean people? Or do you think most are loving and nice? (Same with kids, do you think most are good kids or is being a bad kid apart of being a kid)?
