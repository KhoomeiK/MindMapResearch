Makeup,fqwgmfn,t3_gla3l0,1589703701.0,"When people say ""muddy"" they just mean colors blending together in an unflattering way. Or like, ""overblended"".

Like if contour is blended out too much, it'll just kind look like a muddled brown patch on the face. Or with eyeshadow- generally people aim for a light shade on the lid and a darker shade on the crease. If eyeshadow is overblended though, it'll just kind of look like a gradient? The definition will be lost and the whole lid may turn to a medium shade.

It's not really ""wrong"" per se, if you like how it looks then don't let anyone stop you.

As for people referring to a single *shade* as muddy, I don't really know what they're talking about. That doesn't make any sense to me unless they're saying that it literally resembles mud in some capacity.

I feel like cheap eyeshadows are more likely to blend in an unflattering way for me (where I lose my crease definition) but it's one of those things where application matters most. I think someone with more skill than me could achieve a better look with the same tools."
Instagramreality,fqwfojj,t3_glaa6l,1589702747.0,"This looks like posing to me.

Top pic: arm is covering the ribcage. Not unusual.

Left pic: Girlie is definitely flexing her stomach, appears to be sucking in a little bit (this is why her shoulders appear so high and stiff), torso slightly rotated. It makes it look like her waist is extremely tiny but the shoulders give away the pose.

Right pic: Another killer angle. Her ribs are entirely under that jacket. When you wear a crop top that covers your ribs, it becomes SO easy to make your waist look tiny by flexing/sucking in because your protruding ribs (from inflating your lungs) are hidden entirely.

As someone who is insecure about their waist and knows their angles to try and minimize it, I am confident that her ribcage is not misplaced at all.

GreatBritishBakeOff,foee7p6,t1_foe0775,1587701634.0,Wow! Yes this is super helpful! Thank you so much for the thorough answer. I just found my county's health department website.
muacjdiscussion,fodu7ux,t1_fods4lc,1587690213.0,"Yep! I agree with all of that. When it came to the peach trend I eventually just settled on ordering a [cheap W7 palette](https://w7makeup.com/products/lifes-a-peach) so I could try out peachy looks without investing too much. Omg, I don't know if I just got lucky with my choice in bargain peach palettes or what but I love this little thing. I get the feeling I wouldn't have even liked Too Faced's palette as much lol"
muacjdiscussion,fodsoya,t3_g6rc9x,1587689405.0,"My ideal eyeshadow collection is the one I have now! :) Actually, there's one more mini palette on my wishlist but then I'm good lol

I never declutter anything. I went on a palette buying spree for a while and then slowed the fuck down when I realized just how much eyeshadow I had accumulated. Now I buy a palette every once in a blue moon but otherwise just shop my stash."
GreatBritishBakeOff,fodrebb,t1_foby4m5,1587688704.0,Wow. Do you have any advice for consumers?

EDAnonymous,fodq83v,t1_fobov0q,1587688061.0,Most women do have uneven breasts! But mine are very uneven and now I'm wondering I stunted one lmao.

I hope you love your new makeup by the way."
muacjdiscussion,fodp0ag,t1_fodio9c,1587687403.0,"Yep, I fail to see how more pigment is a bad thing. More bang for my buck- oh no! What a *scam.*"
muacjdiscussion,fodoog9,t1_fodbiav,1587687276.0,"Even shittier when a trend is pioneered by an expensive brand. Not everyone has the money for Too Faced. I don't! I'll wait for a cheaper release and then see it get dismissed because it's already considered passe.

Oh well. At of the day, I'm happy with my palettes and I'm happy with my spending."
