depression,f5x0lze,t3_dpl4bu,1572533555.0,"I feel the exact same way. However I don't care for my job, although it is stable. I hate what I do. But I am the exact same. I go in and act like everything is great, and I am happy. I put on a face and try to get to know people and form relationships. Yet I go home everyday and die inside. I hate my life and what I do, and I also overanalyze everything I do. So I completely understand.

I think what this comes down to is that you have high confidence at work, but low self esteem. So when you go home at night all of those doubts about yourself come rushing out after a day of interacting. You need to work on your self esteem, as do I. You obviously have a lot of ability and you are capable, but you need to have a good self esteem base and love yourself to get through this and move passed hating yourself and what you do. There are. Lot of self help books out there and talks that people have given on this. Not sure if youve looked into anything like that, but you really should. You need to learn to remove the negative self talk."

introvert,epi583w,t1_epgkhqt,1559234767.0,"Yes lucky you, what kind of work do you do?"
introvert,epi55zx,t1_ephw1r8,1559234748.0,"Exactly, I feel that way all the time. And it's exhausting. And it always feels like other people have no issues with it like I do. I get that we need to begin a connection somehow through small talk, but I feel like most of the time it leads nowhere for me."
introvert,epi4tbu,t1_epgpdjw,1559234623.0,"Yes, this is how it is for me too all the time! It is unbearable some days especially starting a new job. If I could find a work from home job and make a decent living I would do that in a heartbeat!!"
