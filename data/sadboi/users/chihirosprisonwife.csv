AskReddit,fgocysa,t3_ezewgo,1580965962.0,"When I was a kid (maybe like 8 years old) my sister and I were playing in the driveway (it was a long, old ass driveway, pretty normal as far as driveways go). We had taken an old stroller from the garage and we were pushing each other around. At the time, my sister was probably 9 or 10. I can't remember what happened, but my sister did something that made me mad, and I decided I would tilt the stroller backwards and let go so that she fell backwards. She hit her head, but it wasn't severe at all. I still feel really bad about it though when I think of her getting up and running into the house crying.





Also, when I was younger (like 7 years old) any time I got mad at my mom, I would tell her that I wished my best friend's stepmom was my mom instead of her. This one really makes me feel bad and I still wish I could take it back because as time went on my mom would say stuff about how she was a bad mom, which most likely wasn't caused by outbursts but it still makes me feel like shit when I think about it."
