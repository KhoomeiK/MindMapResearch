Well, it's what humans do. We make educated guesses and act on our best knowledege and projection. Individuals, organizations, and businesses do it incessantly. Do you not make decisions based on projections of what tomorrow might bring?

If the market is about to tank, which it seems like it very well could given mass unemployment and repossessed cars flooding the market, prices could drop precipitously. If a vehicle is going to be half the price tomorrow of what it is today, should I wait? Well, the answer seems quite obvious, doesn't it. Clearly this is an extreme example, which is clearly not going to bear out, but it makes my point. 

I can get by a week or a few if it's going to save me a couple grand.

Why are you even questioning this? It seems so blatantly obvious ""why people let hypothetical futures dictate their decisions"". So blatantly obvious as to make me curious why you would even pose a question which has an answer that is so readily evident.

getdisciplined,fq7hmmh,t1_fq7er3h,1589146504.0,"That's what I was looking for: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. The thing that I think started me on the path was probiotics. Not supplements per se (which may be as effective, but not sure, as the research seems to be really lacking on questions around probiotics.)

I started consuming a lot of food containing probiotics: yogurt, kimchi, and kombucha in particular. It had such a profound impact that I started making my own at home. I think my system was really depleted from years of incessant stress, life crises, sleeping poorly, not eating that well, not sleeping well, and drinking excessively - all of which can annhilate the microbiome. 

Many things have improved for me since then, but that was the first big change. Impossible to say if my upswing is strictly due to that or not, but I feel that it played a significant role. Since then (that was nearly a decade ago) I've been making better decisions about not drinking as much, prioritizing sleep, diet, and exercise, and meditating and journaling regularly (though not near as much as I'd like to.) Finally, the big kicker, a few months back, I discovered kratom. I have chronic anxiety and back pain, and taking that regularly has made a world of difference for me. I'm barely drinking at all (after a couple decades of being dependent) and I'm doing the pro-active things that I should do more regularly. It's not to say that everything has magically dissapated, but things have drastically improved. If you're not familiar, it's certainly something to be very cautious with. It operates like an opiod, so it can be addictive. I take it several times daily for pain and anxiety management, but I don't get any high from it at all, and I don't feel the pull to take ever greater amounts to get one, but I'll continue to be vigilant about my consumption.

Anyway, that was probably way more info than you bargained for, but just wanted to commiserate, because I know how miserable it can make you feel. If you haven't tried focusing on your microbiome, perhaps that can help you (some people's were wiped out from antibiotics at some point in their lives). Beyond that, perhaps consider looking into kratom if you haven't done so.

I have faith that you'll eventually figure this out through perseverance."
