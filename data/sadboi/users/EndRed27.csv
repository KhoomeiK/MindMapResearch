My son can't tolerate most formulas and is allergic to almost everything including cheap nappies and gaviscon. I was attached to a pump too. Now bubba's formula feed on a special diet and lifes much easier

Maybe buy a door stop to put under your door when you sleep and check your shelf for a camera. Grabbing your butt will just be the beginning. I was groomed once too and it started out with things like this. My sister was also groomed by another pedophile at the age of 13 and I have a feeling it started this way. Reach out to people and let people know what type of man he is and don't worry about your bfs relationship that's for them to sort. But I don't think your bf will want much to do with his father after he hears what he has done
