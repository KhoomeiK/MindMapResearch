Greysexuality,fq0snea,t3_ggbsq5,1589037103.0,I have to have that immediate connection with someone for me to consider actually dating them. I tend to have really long relationships but the waiting inbetween breakups suck because most of the time I like the person as a friend but I'm just never attracted to them. Dating sites don't work for me and I usually meet my partner through a friend.
unpopularopinion,fp9s22y,t3_gc2eqx,1588433362.0,This is so weird to me but I see it happen a lot. Small kids are so annoying and I would much rather have an older kid. My dad was the same way and started being able to connect to me more as I got older until he passed away. I don't want kids but maybe being in a big sister type of program would be cool
AskReddit,fp9hv2r,t3_gbzdtd,1588426607.0,Toy Story 2 lmfao. I was a kid and when the girl grows up and throws Jessie under the bed and forgets about her I would get really upset because I was extremely attatched to my stuffed animals and never wanted to abandon them.
Greysexuality,fp9hbwz,t3_gbx3va,1588426205.0,Hello!! It sounds like you are grey to me! I just found out recently thay I am also grey. You could also be like me- homoromantic. I have romantic feelings towards all genders but then when sex is involved...different story. I tried to ignore it by writing it off as super picky but for god's sake..I even dated this one guy for 8 months and found every excuse to not do anything physical. I've been with my bf now for 2 years and we are about 3 hours long distance. We do have physical intimacy but every time I get really nervous even if I don't show it. I love it because I'm with him and nothing else. He's definitely not asexual but never pushy so it works well for us.
childfree,fp2f2si,t1_fp0yczq,1588260657.0,"That is an interesting view. I personally disagree that there is no discrimination within the asexual community and I think that there are some that feel invisible. There are plenty like you that do not want a label, but those that do should have a community to go to. And LGBTQ is about accepting sexual preferences so why should they not accept those that also have skewed preferences in comparison to the rest of the world? The ace spectrum can be hard for people to grasp, but homoromantics and other bi people fall in that spectrum and shouldn't be unwelcome."
