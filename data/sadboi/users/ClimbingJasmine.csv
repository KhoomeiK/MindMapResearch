bipolar,eu9vjsb,t1_eu9kiv2,1563592068.0,I bailed on mine tonight. And she was visiting from out of town! Lame.
BipolarReddit,ersrc2u,t3_c3mxvd,1561222125.0,"I was on the same train of thought last night. I know sleep is so important for me, and when I’m tired in the late afternoon I tell myself I’m going to bed early tonight. But I end up staying up late anyway. On my phone knowing fully I shouldn’t be. I resonate with what you said about it being a futile attempt to delay tomorrow. It’s self sabotage and I know it but at the same time sneakily do it anyway."

gardening,eprewuy,t1_epr9tyg,1559423349.0,"I didn’t realize that about the roots. Makes a lot of sense though. I don’t think I have it in me to save them, but thanks for the education. [Last days in the sun for these.](https://imgur.com/gallery/MvKnD6n) Will miss the privacy. Any thoughts on what to plant to the right? The yard will be smaller (up to where the trees are), so canopy can’t be too big but height would be good. Thank you!"
gardening,epr90om,t1_epr6xlf,1559420368.0,"Wow, thanks for saving me the hassle and clearing my conscience about it.  We are taking down the fence and removing the concrete so I thought it might be worth a shot. They’re pretty and give some privacy from the neighbors. But we’ll plant new ones. Thanks again. That machine is really something!"
