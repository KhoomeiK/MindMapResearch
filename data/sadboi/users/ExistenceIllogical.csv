For the nuke silos, make sure you have all the terminal perks upgraded. As you progress throughout the silo you can hack terminals to power down the turrets (which are the worst) and named Robobrains, just leaving you with the mobs to deal with. They're a lot more manageable without having the turrets to deal with.

Good luck."

They need to work out a planned schedule with you and you need to strictly adhere to that. Withdrawal symptoms can have negative side effects. What if you were driving then got a dizzy spell?
