ParanormalEncounters,fqky8qd,t3_gga8z5,1589439914.0,"So about 13 years ago (yikes) when I was in my young teens, my mom and I (who are very close) noticed a phenomenon where we would text each other within seconds, or where she would have a dream about me while I was away and know in the dream where I was or what I was doing. Both of us being paranormal enthusiasts and having gotten high scores on Zener cards at the time, we decided to see if we could communicate telepathically across the room from each other. I remember so clearly “sending” her a word or phrase and it was this feeling almost like throwing a ball and hoping she’d catch it, and the satisfaction when she would say the word I was “sending”. Fast forward, the only skill I really gained from this is that I can telepathically manipulates my best friend into losing Rock, Paper, Scissors every single time, which is eerie I guess if you think about it.

So to sum that all up, I totally believe it’s possible to will things into existence, or pass thoughts telepathically, all those kinds of things."

I know that in needier times in my family’s life, my mum and my grandma have both used things that aren’t walkers as walkers, because we couldn’t afford a real walker. Third theory I have is that it is part of a grieving process. Perhaps one of them, or both, are grieving the loss of a child in their life.
