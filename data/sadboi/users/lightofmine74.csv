Anxiety,fqafyrf,t3_ghiqy2,1589218413.0,"Me too and it sucks...then I go one step further and apologize to the people I feel like I may have offended or did something weird in their presence.  They act as if I'm crazy, don't know what I'm talking about and can't believe I'm still thinking about it.  Which makes me feel embarrassed, crazy and hyper conscious of my actions and it starts all over again yet worse because I tried to face my awkwardness and ridiculed."
