Society has these standards and things expected of me that I just can’t live up to or fulfill. I’m unable to live up to societies standards, nor do I want to for a lot of them.

As for things that make me happy. Really the only thing that makes me truly happy is music, I like listening to it and playing it. I like other things like video games and YouTube but they don’t do the same."

AMA,fq1r9r3,t1_fpwzms9,1589048294.0,"Ok. It’s for a lot of reasons so it will be a long read.

Basically, for starters, there’s more support and help for girls. Everyone cares about girls and wants to do all these things to help them, support for women’s sports and all that. When girls have mental illnesses they’re taken seriously and cared about, when a guy does he’s told to man up. Girls can be masculine and it’s ok, but if a guy wants to be feminine he’s ridiculed and attacked. Many more reasons like that. Basically I want to be cared about, and as someone who’s dealing with mental illness, that’s very needed.

There’s so many standards and things in society for guys that I just can’t fulfil and live up to. None of them really. I’ve always felt that everything in my life would be acceptable if I was female. For example I have asperger syndrome, for a girl, that’s ok. Girls can be shy and it’s ok and seen as cute. If a guy is, then he’s basically fucked. Especially when it comes to dating, don’t even get me started on that.

It also seems far more glamorous. Girls seem to be much closer with each other. Girl friendships seem to be better, everyone cares about each other and is loving and supportive. Guy friendships are basically just bullying, which I can’t handle. It seems more fun. Like women’s sports teams and all that looks like fun.

There’s plenty of other reasons too that I struggle to put into words because of my stupid autistic brain. If you want to hear more about them just message me.

I want to be loved and cared about. I want to be small and delicate. I want to matter to people.

I know not being a girl isn’t easier if that’s what anyone thinks I’m saying. There’s not so good things about being a girl too, like not being safe at night, pregnancy, periods, pay gap, ect. But, I know I could handle those problems better than Male ones, that’s a fact."

2. I have, I get absolutely shit on everytime.

3. I’m not sure about this one. I always forget about that. But the times where I actually remembered, the person I’m fighting just comes right around and kills me.

4. Similar to 3

5. I do this and it doesn’t help. I still die all the time. With randoms though they just shit talk me when I do bad.

6. I already do that.

7. Explain

8. Not sure how to improve that

9. Even when I’m not I still keep dying

10. I try. It’s so hard to have fun and enjoy it when you do nothing but die all the time. Especially when you watch other people get lots of kills and I never have any. I don’t like getting carried. It just triggers my depression as I said.
