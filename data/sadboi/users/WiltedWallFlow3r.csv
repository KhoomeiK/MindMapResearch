matheducation,foqgi74,t1_foqfn2j,1587993019.0,"1. No it isnt an issue, im allowed to use it on remedial and summer courses.

2.  the college pushed back the start date of summer term to june 1st to see if they could still stay with face-2-face classes. But thats all up in the air right now. We do have smartThinking, which is online tutoring"
math,fop3y9c,t1_fop2o0f,1587952548.0,"I took it cold.
It starts june 1st, and lasts for 6 weeks, and intermediate algebra starts right after for another 6 weeks and ends in late august. Fall term starts in september. It would set me back by 6 weeks since the prep courses are only 6 weeks long in the summer and 8 weeks during fall/spring. Idk how i feel about cramming algebra into 6 weeks.

Otoh, theres another intermediate algebra class that lasts the full 12 weeks over the summer that also starts june 1st. 

My other option to stay on track is to take the remedial math for 6 weeks, and then in the fall take intermediate algebra and college algebra back to back for 10 weeks each with a prof that has really good ratings on RMP(Ratemyprofessor)"
