Mom and Dad cleaned for a total for 5 hrs over two days. The whole time we lived in that house, the tenants were psycho, spying on us, getting our neighbours to report every little thing we did, screaming down the phone at our agent multiple times a week for the entire year we lived there because of wild fake stories about how we were 'destroying the property', wanting us to make a mansion out of a shitty house they'd built very, very wrong, etc. After the final inspection before we moved out, my parents were told to clean the whole house top to bottom all over because it was 'unacceptable'. This was because there were three pieces of hay on the ground outside on a fucking FARM property. I wish I was making this shit up. They really wanted that money and a reason to kick us out."

BPDmemes,fiwifdn,t1_fiwddq8,1582787211.0,"Some times after a long day of agonising over whether my fp really cares about me or not, I take to the evergreen, naked and covered in bio luminescent moss, my white hair wild and free beneath my make shift tree branch antlers, shadowed by the moon's radiant and familiar light. 

I take to the woods, my grubby feet drawn to the path as if by some mystic and ancient magnetic energy, the quiet foxes my guide, the raccoon perched upon my shoulder my familiar. I break through a clearing and a still crystal pool greets me. She reflects the sky, bright and speckled with burning lights, but just as dark as the night whispers around me, drawing me closer. Rippling gently beneath a draft, she calls my name and i creep closer, her cerulean night brush soft beneath my feet. 

A woman's voice calls to me, dry and warm as ash. ""Well met, green witch."" She sighs, a million life times unfolding beneath her touch. ""Ask me your question, child."" She breathes, and my knees fall to the mossy earth. 

I press my face against her bank, my fingers pale like bones, bruised and blue in the seagrass. ""My lady."" I hush, and from her quiet, I know she listens. ""I've come to ask that of which I have asked many times before."" 

For a moment, silence, unbroken by her ancient and unusual presence until she breathes once more. ""Daughter,"" she hums, her low voice revebrating through the forest. ""For that, you already know the answer."" 

But I insist, my toes digging into the ground in an attempt to anchor myself. ""Mother, please."" I beg, weak and frail before her. ""Does he really love me? Will my love ever be enough for him to stay by my side forever more?"" 

I freeze as a strange buzzing fills the air, a dozen sets of eyes real or imagined blinking furiously as they tear off into the woods. My familiar is unsettled but brazen, locating the source of the sound from my loin cloth, ratty and torn. He grasps at something with his paws, passing it into my hands. I stare down at the strange object he has given me, familiar but alien. 

I toss it over in my hands and feel it's smooth glass surface as it flickers to life, revealing an odd series of numbers that reads ""2:05"" and a cryptic message that reads ""found service."" 

Mother's chuckle revebrates through me, her gentle green waters lapping at my feet. ""Go on, child."" She smiles, with all the warmth of my mother long since passed. ""I believe you're needed elsewhere."" 

For a moment, I pause, looking between Mother and the device. It takes me a moment but as if by second nature, I drag my finger across what I believe to be it's screen, and I'm greeted by a red circle surrounding the number ""150"". I click on the circle and it directs me to 'messages'. 

A name repeats over and over again. 

Craig. 

Craig. 

Craig? 

Why does that name sound so familiar to me? I'm redirected to 'voice mail' and I curiously click on a small triangle. I almost drop the device as it starts blaring, echoing throughout the woods. 

""JESUS CHRIST MELANIE, IT'S BEEN THIRTY MINUTES!! I DON'T LOVE YOU ANY LESS JUST BECAUSE I TEXTED :) INSTEAD OF :)) WHEN YOU ASKED IF I WANTED CHINESE TONIGHT. BABE, I LOVE YOU, BUT IF YOU'RE NOT HOME IN TWENTY MINUTES, I'M GOING TO CALL THE COPS AND YOU'RE RICE IS GOING TO GET COLD."" 

For a moment, I'm swallowed up by the night and Mother laughs her throaty laugh, her voice caressing my shoulders. ""Well?"" She croaks, full of mirth. """"Did you find what you were looking for?"" 

I nod, tears falling down my face. ""Yes, ma'am."" I stand, rubbing at my eyes with the palm of my hand as I pull my antlers from my hair. ""There's someone at home who needs me. Someone worthy of my love. In all its parts."" 

Mother smiles. She twinkles beneath the moon's tender glow. ""So long, witch."" She hums, her magick all around me as I turn foot and run back through the woods towards home. ""I'll be waiting for you here tomorrow."""
