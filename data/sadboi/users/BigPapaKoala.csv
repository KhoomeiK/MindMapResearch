BPD,foo3efz,t3_g8jvs5,1587931722.0,"While I technically got BPD I am just in the thought of this is who I am and I've accepted it so I don't treat people with different diagnosis differently I treat everybody I know the same whether its ADHD, Anxiety or even Autism.

I do agree with what you say though however I think all that thinking should just not exist. Something that is important you know is that to get BPD you have to have gone through some serious trauma there isn't really any other way of getting it. Between 70% to 80% of people with BPD will attempt suicide in their lives (Myself has attempted and been hospitalised 3 times in the last 2 years)

So my guess would be for those reasons people with it can tend to be more protective? Than again with BPD people are not themselves some of the time so that can be a cause too.

Tis just a wack illness but I appreciate your post amigo :)

You may find yourself unattractive but I see you suffering from some low self esteem due to some pretty traumatic shit. Something I dealt with for a lawng time but eventually got over. 

My advice would be learning to like how you look, or do small things to improve yourself like maybe dress a way you feel good in, get a haircut you like etc. Get that self esteem up. 

The most important thing for a almost all people I know (Bois and Gorls) is just having confidence in yourself. It's lovely and corny but beautiful and true but can't expect people to be attracted to you if you aint attracted to yoself :D"
