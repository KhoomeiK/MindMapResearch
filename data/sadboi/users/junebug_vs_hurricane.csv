In the end, the important thing is that you get the right treatment. Psychiatric disorders are generally an attempt to name problems that don't always fit perfectly into those boxes. In fact I've had doctors changed my diagnosis specifically to justify to my insurance why they were giving me a certain treatment! Like the doctors knew that DBT benefits suicidal people but it was only assesssble to people with a BPD diagnosis so they just put that on the form. 

Don't let the labels hold you down. Some diagnoses have a lot of stigma or a depressing prognosis, but those things aren't necessarily true. Beware of stereotypes and people who assume shit. Bipolar doesn't mean one is an addict. Autism doesn't mean one is screechy. ADHD doesn't mean one is lazy.
