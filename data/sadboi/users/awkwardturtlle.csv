morbidquestions,fdd0866,t1_fclidri,1578289719.0,He was only 19. Full scholarship to college and on the deans list at a very prestigious school. He was on track to join the Air Force after graduation. He had a bright future. The vengeful part of me wants her to see the note so she would know how much she hurt and manipulated him. It would destroy her I think. And I don’t feel bad about that. But the other part of me like I said doesn’t want her to see it because she would find comfort in him saying how much he loved her. Like a final testament to his love for her “if I can’t have you there’s no reason to live”

morbidquestions,fcjh0f7,t3_egc0on,1577687272.0,My little brother killed himself. He was going through a breakup and the girl did a lot of fucked up shit. He left a note all about how much he loved her and wished she would stop lying. We told her she was blamed in the note but we didn’t give her details because we didn’t want her to see his final words saying he loved her. We wanted her to feel the blame but not his love.
