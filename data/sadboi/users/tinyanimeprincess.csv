Some can still feel their anger and happiness but not the same way they used to. Please don't give up on yourself, even with depression clouding it, your future is still bright. I suggest going to the doctor and talking to them. Keep a written record of your feelings and thoughts in the 2 weeks leading up to the appointment. This way you'll be able to better tell your doctor about your symptoms. It can be scary, especially with all the stigma around it. But your doctor can help. Also, I must congratulate you for reaching out here. I know that it's not an easy thing to do. Never hold those feelings in, talk to someone, even if its just this group of strangers on the internet.  And as for your self harming, when you feel the urge to so it again, grab a pen and write where you want to hurt yourself, this way you won't actually be hurting yourself, but it will be a similar outlet for you.

Make sure you're open and honest with your doctor. That's the only way they can help you properly. If you have a close friend you have been confiding in, bring them. They may remember to tell your doctor things you don't. If not, it will be helpful to write down what you've been feeling for the 2 weeks leading up to your appointment. It will take off some of the pressure and anxiety since you'll be a little prepared. Also, research your doctor and make sure depression is something they specialize in. Most General Practitioners don't. And even if they do they'll prescribe something to try, and send you to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist, unlike a psychologist, main specialty is monitoring your medication and ensuring its working, and it's the right one. Psychologist are the therapists. So be prepared. If you don't like your psychiatrist, gonto your doctor asap. Like as soon as you know you're not gonna be comfortable with them. They can recommend someone else for you. Or you can research on your own and find one that may be better for you, you'll never know until you try with them though. Please don't delay in going, you deserve help just as any woman would."

Your head space is the most important thing to being able to do the things you want. Dont feel so guilty about the feelings. Just continue to be honest. And try to be more open with your therapist.

depression_help,ficw4sg,t1_ficsbum,1582358026.0,"That, my friend, is thinking you need to stop, right now. You need to realize that, not one person here feels like they have to respond. You need to see that we're all here because we want to try and support you. Go ahead and cry, cry until you cant cry any more. Then get up, grab your favorite drink you have on hand, and head outside to your car. What kind of car is it? My brother is a car fanatic, and I'm only half interested, but listening to people who really love their car talk about it is fun for me😆. Also, Google search for any car shows you can go to, even if you don't feel like going, go anyway. You need to get out of the house, and do something for you. Or just take a long warm bubble bath. Play your favorite song. Or play a song that gets on your nerves but makes you smile anyway. For most people, Happy by Pharrell Williams gets on their nerves but gets them smiling. Or play baby shark and do the dance in the silliest most dramatic way you possibly can and laugh at yourself, because without fail, you'll know you look ridiculous but it's fun. You're human. You're not perfect. But you're a better person than Hitler. Everyone can smile because they're better than him. Boom 1 reason to put on a smile. Another thing that I've found helpful is volunteering. The last thing you want to do is get up and go out for you, but what if you do it for someone else? Like volunteering at a place for special needs children (or children's hospitals). Or if you're not a kid person, volunteer at an animal shelter. Or homeless shelters. Itll be hard at first, but instead of paying attention to how you're feeling in those moments, look into the eyes of the ones you're helping. You'd be able to see the joy your just being there brings them. Above all though, you NEED to find at least one thing to entertain yourself. Even if it seems small and meaningless, its meaning will be found in the joy, even if its just a little, it brings you. On days like today, when you don't have much energy, do little things to care for yourself. Small simple meals, your favorite snacks, wash your face (and yo armpits, don't wanna knock yourselfout😝), brush your teeth, then turn around and crawl right back into bed and have a nap. Also, even though theres a lot of stigma around it, go to the doctor, go see a therapist. Dont like the first, second, or third one? Go find a different one. Dont worry about the stigma, anyone who has anything negative to say, pull out the big shiny scissors of love yourself and cut that ignorant fool out of your life. Also, even though it can be hard, or scary, cut off your ""friends"" who don't want to support you, and don't genuinely care about how your feeling. There are a whole bunch of strangers on the internet who care and genuinely want to know how you're feeling. If you ever need too vent, feel free to inbox me. I'm always will to lend an ear... although in this case its eyes😅"

And 1 who, after a few long hard years, became a best friend. Spend some time with your friends. Even if it's just one of them, you deserve to go out and have a little fun. Even though it's hard, find something to put your extra time into, something you can really enjoy. Personally I love watching anime and Asian dramas 😆. For you it could be something as simple as gaming, or something like dance or just working out. Or even cooking can be fun when you find good recipes 😛😋.
