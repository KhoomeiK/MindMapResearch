Thank you so much for the work you do and for selflessly taking care of all the folks out there. I cannot imagine what you are experiencing right now. 

I do not know you or if these words will mean anything to you, but I find two quotes particularly helpful from Viktor Frankl's ""Man's Search for Meaning"" (written on his experience and philosophy from surviving the Holocaust):

1) Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.

2) Don't aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run—in the long-run, I say!—success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it"
careeradvice,fojzuaa,t1_fojxuke,1587832699.0,"> There was no question it was a one night stand. We both agreed we were looking for fun only. 

If this is true and she was honest with him in the moment, then he did not dispose of her. They had an understanding and agreement. She changed her mind and he was firm in his personal boundary; he is actively choosing not to be manipulated.

I believe you are inappropriately judging him. If it is consensual sex by both parties and if both parties agree that a one-time coupling was fun and okay, nobody was ""used"" and discarded. Two adults made an adult decision. The end. 

I do find it interesting that this is your reflection on his story though, and it is perhaps revealing about your own experiences. You would condemn a man to lose his livelihood in this economy and then suggest that he leverage the emotions of this woman to resecure his occupation. What is the message you are attempting to communicate? Is he the objectifying tool that uses a person, and so should continue to use her as a means of compensation to be made whole OR is karma coming back to bite him because he is just a bad person? 

I could see a point of view where you think it is both, but your post reads as less compassionate than your appraisal of OP and the way this woman behaved towards each other."
pornfreewomen,fnajo1b,t3_fzrtq7,1586798667.0,"As a man in recovery, this message resonated with me. An exgirlfriend followed every word of your statement to the letter. Further, my issues with pornography started around age 13, and I think this is what created such a terrible mental and emotional positive feedback loop.

I realize now that our interactions created a fantasy with both this narcissistic/self orientation and a sensitization to fantasy in this exact archetype. It was cathartic to read what you have shared of your experience and perspective. This helped me. Thank you."
WomensHealth,fb4rqpp,t1_fb4czt1,1576514370.0,"There is the phenomenon where we can focus on previous discomforts and those expectations can bias the sensations we actually feel.

If there is anything that consistently feels good, you might try to see what the difference is between that experience and pain.

Also, some people have latex allergies or issues with various autoimmune stuff that flairs with  certain birth controls.

Does the pain happen even without intercourse? 

Just remember this isn't a failure on your part. This isn't you vs him. This is you and him trying to figure out what can work for you both."
WomensHealth,fb4c820,t3_ebem6j,1576506111.0,"(Take with a grain of salt; am male) While it could be a medical condition or have originated with a medical condition, one thing to consider is that at this point you may be experiencing psychosematic symptoms.

My first girlfriend experienced vaginismus (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginismus) due to early life trauma that caused involuntary tightening/low arousal. If you had pain at one point, you may be psyching yourself out to a certain degree. For my ex, she found that deep breathing exercises, figuring out her own body/playing with herself independent of me, and being in safe/non-stressful conditions helped for when we went to go do things on our own. 

It may be that you now need to ""retrain"" yourself a bit. 

However, I don't want to discount your discomfort or that you may still have lingering medical issues-this is just one possibility that you may have more power over in the mean time.

You may also try some CBD cream or a mild numbing cream to get back in the groove."

TMJ,evbvwmz,t1_evbdjmo,1564397082.0,"Yes, it is on the left side of my head/jaw specifically. TMJ is often the result of grinding/stress. Have you also been experiencing head aches? H as a lot been going on recently? So you notice it pick up after a stimulant like caffeine? Usually, it isnt the bite so much as grinding. I would talk to your dentist about getting a bite splint if you can."
TMJ,evbcukv,t3_cj5uk4,1564372908.0,"I have the same thing and it definitely manifested with my tmj. Braces often dont help tmj. You may benefit from facial exercises/jaw exercises, but mine has not gone away after a year of PT."
TMJ,eujt4wy,t3_cglwf5,1563878051.0,"I also have a messed up bite from poor ortho wor k and TMJ. I clenched so hard that I developed permanent lacerations on the tendons on the left side of my jaw.

I highly recommend getting a bite splint to prevent you from grinding your teeth while you sleep. This will also help keep your teeth from shifting and will hold your mouth in a better position. 

Second: look for a TMJ physical therapist and get a referal from your PCP. I have a 30/seen co pay, but the exercises I have learned and massages I receive have been life changing. Id you're in the Maryland area, pm me and I can recommend a PT."
