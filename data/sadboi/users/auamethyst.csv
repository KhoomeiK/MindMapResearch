I am mostly vegan, 99% of the time. Sometimes I do allow myself to eat dairy while traveling or at a family gathering. I noticed that the occasional hit of dairy actually makes my body feel good for some reason. The rest of the time, I choose vegan dairy products. 

Choosing not to eat something because it doesn't make you feel good physically is ok. It's like the person who has a mild allergy to peanuts. Should the anorexic who doesn't eat peanuts because it gives him/her hives eat them in recovery for the sake of recovery? Of course not.

If dairy gives you blemishes and impacts you in a negative way unrelated to body size or calorie concerns, then I think it is ok for you to choose other foods instead. It doesn't mean the food in an of itself is *bad*, but maybe your body would prefer other foods instead.

It's crazy thought because I can go for a while and eat what I think is a lot of calorie laden junk, and my weight just stays about the same."
fuckeatingdisorders,ffg8ovm,t3_etc9yo,1579900859.0,"I WISH I was Chinese or had some Chinese family/friends so I could celebrate Chinese new year! Those pineapple tarts are so great, and Chinese pastries in general are absolutely delicious.

You know the name of the game, restriction = binging. If you forbid these foods to yourself, you will end up binging on them at some point. Which, of course isn't a pleasant experience.  

It IS possible to enjoy treats and not lose control around them. Pastries, sweets, cakes, white rice, all those things CAN and SHOULD be enjoyed as part of a healthy balanced diet.

Please have a pineapple tart for me!"
fuckeatingdisorders,ffg8ao8,t3_etf8v0,1579900619.0,"Fuck a meal plan to be honest. Give in to that extreme hunger, because it is your body screaming for food. Ignoring it will only perpetuate the problem and make it last longer."
fuckeatingdisorders,ffg860l,t3_et8pcn,1579900540.0,"Yeah it's really stupid. Losing, maintaining, and gaining weight is FAR more complex than CICO."
fuckeatingdisorders,ffg814j,t3_etfewi,1579900456.0,"And do you like not being dizzy and lightheaded? Use that as an incentive not to get to that point again.

When I am faced with the want to avoid eating, I think, when I did this in the past I felt like absolute shit. It makes the decision to eat a little easier."

healthyeating,ffg7ksk,t3_et5ivy,1579900172.0,Whatever style of eating works best for you and your body.
intuitiveeating,ffg7iwg,t1_ffeifvp,1579900139.0,Me too! I am so fascinated with how everyone does things differently and has different likes and dislikes. It is absolutely wildly interesting.
intuitiveeating,ffg7elm,t3_et4wdo,1579900065.0,"WTF is wrong with people. Yes, there is such a thing as too much fat, but also too much carbs, too much protein, too much vitamins, too much of anything can be detrimental. 

There is room for everything in any diet."
intuitiveeating,ff33tlx,t3_erdd1j,1579532972.0,"I define binging as eating very fast and feeling unable to stop, a loss of control. It feel like panic eating to me. I absolutely hate it, and the only thing that prevents it for me is eating on a regular basis.

It sounds as if you were just simply hungry for more food, and felt satisfied afterwards. Some days you will want to eat more, some days you won't. That is normal and natural."
fuckeatingdisorders,ff33mkk,t3_er31kz,1579532827.0,"It helped for me to already imagine myself bigger than I was during the process, that way it wasn't as much of a shock. 

I don't hate my new body, but there are days when I want to lose weight and go back to restricting. But it makes me go crazy, so I know it's a horrible idea."
ADHD,ff31z51,t1_ff30anq,1579531567.0,"I hate doing it that way, it feels like a punishment and makes me overeat at breakfast."
ADHD,ff1rfmh,t1_ff1fllo,1579484532.0,"I used to be on concerta and it helped my workouts then, I was really into running at the time and could run miles on miles. I’m not medicated now, and I’d be nervous to go back on it because of my anxiety and I’m a chronic under-eater and it also kills my appetite.

But fuck it would be so nice to focus again."
intuitiveeating,fezx5fb,t1_fezvybs,1579462827.0,"That's a great option. Some people just don't get hungry for solid food until later in the day, and that's fine. I usually have to drink a lot of water first after waking up before I'm ready."
intuitiveeating,fezvni5,t1_fezvdvu,1579462249.0,"You tried to drink anything with calories? If you aren't ready for solid food, no point into trying to force yourself to eat if you really aren't hungry."
