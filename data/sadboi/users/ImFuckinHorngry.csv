And is it because they find me attractive, or is it only because they admire my style alone?

My feelings vary about things and how I interact with other people though. When I'm out with my guy friends, trans or otherwise, I tend to take the lead, not entirely out of desire to... I mean yes, I do like it, but sometimes almost out of necessity because otherwise it's just waiting for them to do something that never happens. Like...I like taking the lead for the most part because it helps me feel that empowerment that I am a strong independent woman. I like feeling that authoritative presence, but every so often, I really want them to take the initiative at least once in a while. Whether it's holding open a door, deciding where to go, holding my stuff for me.

It's a hard thing to tell yourself that you're worthwhile and that people care about you when you don't believe it yourself, so sometimes you really need someone else to tell you for you. I know I'm just an internet stranger, and I don't know the real you outside of reddit, but I've read your comments and you sound like a very outwardly kind and caring person that deserve the same respect shown to you.

And most importantly, you DO deserve to love yourself, and eat healthy, and to get a good night's sleep, and take care of yourself mentally and physically.

If people are treating you wrong, or avoiding you because of your depression, it's not because of you, it's because they don't understand the pain of it. You may be treated unfairly by some, but I'm sure you are loved by others, even if you don't see it. They care about you, but they don't understand how difficult it is to have depression, and it can be mentally taxing on others that don't get it. I do, and it's a constant struggle. It's not something that's easily cured. It's not something that goes away. It's something that has to be constantly fought, and it never seems like a winning battle, but please keep fighting. You never asked to have depression, and you know you don't want it. You can't control how you feel, but you can work to manage it. I know you will push this through these feelings eventually, but like with most things, it will just take time effort. Be strong, and please take care of yourself."

Not all the time, and I don't see that as passing. I've also had several cis people tell me I don't pass at all. Too much hugboxxing can put a false idea in your head that will end up hurting you when you find out it isn't true. Not to mention, when you're only relying on a person's photo, it's impossible to know whether they actually pass because the right light and angle can make any cis person appear another gender. There are so many factors that cannot make people pass, and it's impossible to judge on a few photos alone.

Compliment people, tell them positive things they are doing that's helping improve their chances of being gendered properly. Acknowledge when someone put effort into their appearance. But most importantly, be honest."
MtF,ffwlrst,t3_evjh7r,1580304946.0,"I'm sorry that you had to hear that. Being stealth is a double edged sword, and can be extremely difficult to deal with situations like this. You feel yourself being perceived and treated as cis, but are. ore highly likely to hear shit like this. You want to speak your mind so much, but concerned to think how they react and if they start to suspect you of being trans when you're trying to keep that part of your life secret, and then word getting out and subsequently having everyone suddenly treat you differently.

If you are out to at least HR, you may want to start a report about them in the event that some altercation or harassment happens in the future. They don't need to pull this guy aside or make him take sensitivity training, but at long as you at least preemptively start a file detailing how you're concerned about this person, it will help you if something happens in the future.

Whatever decision you make, I hope things works out, and it  doesn't put too much mental stress on you."

Some just find it much more mentally exhausting to go through transition than it was before they decided to. Some are unable to do to any number of factors, such as finances, social status, employment, etc. Some just realize later that they are in fact not trans at all, but the journey helped them discover themselves a bit and helped them have a better understanding of what they want in life. Whatever the reason, they should be allowed to do whatever they feel like with their own body, and we should all support them just the same."

Regardless of whether a person is trans or not, that is just a fucked up thing to say in general.  I am so sorry that you had to hear that from someone who is supposed to be your own father.  And your mother just sitting quietly, not offering any support, is just kicking you on the ground after being gut punched, especially after she just called you the day before to say she accepts you. I'm assuming she probably still feels the same as she does when she spoke with you, but she may just be afraid to say anything for fear of having your father lash out at her too.

I hope you realize that you are not a burden to anyone, and you deserve to live your life as who you are, regardless of whatever he feels.  I can understand it's difficult to ignore it, him being your father and the one who raised you, but parents don't always know best.  I hope you're able to continue to push on without comments like his clouding your mind.  He doesn't deserve a second thought, and you deserve so much more."

They did a lot of bad things, not specifically to me, but bad enough that it made me incredibly uncomfortable to hear and be near this person. Regardless, I assumed that they would change and I helped them out and gave them support when I could. They seemed to be a better person in the present than the person they described in the past, but I kept my guard anyway. There were a lot of signs that they were not changing much different than how they were in the past and I realized they still had a lot of introspection to go through about themselves. I eventually left them up to their own devices. I still offer support when they request it, but I do it in a very minimal way, and I try to distance myself from that person when possible.

What I'm trying to say is, you can be supportive, but don't assume that they've completely changed. Protect yourself and don't do anything you feel uncomfortable with. And above all else, make sure it's well known what they did to you in the past and why it was so traumatizing. If they still brush it off like it was no big deal, then it's not worth listening to their pain if they don't acknowledge yours."

In the beginning, I had so much hope and promise that I would look amazing considering that I had so many feminine qualities to me, and I thought I'd be able to pass easily within a few months. It's been a year, and I feel like I'm just getting progressively worse in how I feel about myself and my perception of how others interact with me. I now look like some weird feminine looking dude, but still a guy, and my hormones have been checked several times and I'm at the right levels. I've been practicing my voice for over a year, and don't sound any different than how I was from recordings of me from a couple years ago. I pass occasionally, but I can never tell if they really see me as female, or just humoring me. I've tried acting confident, but it just people to notice and stare even more at me. I get misgendered all the time at work, and always when on the phone. I've lost all interest in self care anymore. I don't worry about my hair, or my nails, or how I dress. I'm honestly starting to feel worse than before I accepted I was trans. It's making me question again whether or not I'm actually trans. I thought I had support in the beginning, but most people tend to ignore me now. I've tried to be outgoing, but I can only push myself so much until the stress just becomes too unbearable. I now just go to work, do my job, and head back home and avoid the outside world. I feel like as much as I accomplished in the past year, I've gotten nowhere, and right back to where I was before, but now I have boobs I can't hide, a smooth face, long hair, and matching IDs with my correct name, but a very masculine face, frame, and voice.
