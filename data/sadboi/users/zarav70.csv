‚ÄúMy advice is to follow a program, eat a high protein diet, practice progressive overload, and be patient.

In the beginning I was working out at home so I followed a YT channel called FitnessBlender, they introduced me to weight training and muscle focused exercises, then I moved onto Bret Contreras program Strong Curves, then for a good year I made a big mistake of following random workout on insta & changing it up weekly which stunted my progress of a long time, now I am back to following a program by Krissy Cela & I have seen more progress in 3 months than I have for a year. Although I enjoy her program, I credit the growth just to following a program in general so I really wanna emphasis that.

Other than that, creatine, in my opinion, has also helped my progress A LOT.

Hope that helps :)‚Äù"

I lose and gain an appetite off and on throughout the week, not sure why but I‚Äôve come to get used to being inconsistent so I work with what my diet has been like days prior. I don‚Äôt strictly track my carbs & fat but I try and be reasonable. I track everything on MFP as well."
