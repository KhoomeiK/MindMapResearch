I am 45. Never married, kinda stable with work, have had many LTRs. Still renting, have shit for savings. AAS degree. Bipolar disorder (well controlled). Would a man want to date me? Sure he would! 

My boyfriend is 46. Never married, blue collar job with decent pay career, no savings, HS education. Would a woman want to date him? YEP!

Personally, I'd be interested with you if I could understand the career and some of the work inside it, as a conversation piece and common interest. Can you sustain yourself on your own? Yeah, good. How much attention do you pay to your career vs a woman you date? (this will vary per relationship. My point is be careful.)
If you make 35K a year, I'd ask oh why, engineer, I assumed different OH yeah student loan stuff. Understandable. Know what? My bf makes less than that a year. I'm ok with that, money isn't a HUGE factor in dating. (don't be a mooch)

Another thought: are you saying ""Yeah I'll date cuz I have time"" or ""I'm ready, I'm ok with spending emotional energy not just time"" 

Have I followed those milestones? Oh HELL no. Learned white collar skills, doing a blue collar job unrelated. Married in 30s? Hell no. Dating? A little bit. Mental and neurological illness? Yep, and someone loves me so much it's **less my background and more my internal beliefs.** If you don't follow those, I wouldn't care. **Your internal beliefs are what matter most.**"

askwomenadvice,fn4q206,t3_fzis99,1586646521.0,"Research cost of living Seattle vs Wherever

What kind of job do you want? Can you transfer within company? Do you need exact same job, or can you do something related? Research how many of these jobs or positions are available in the possible new area. Hiring? Not?

What do you want to live in? How much can you afford? Do you have a car as many other cities don't have a great bus system? If you just moved into a place, how long could you stay without being broke?

What political leanings are in that area, do they jive with you? (I moved from a very blue city to a red area that's gently moving to blue and I'm ok). 

If you move, how will you get your stuff there? What's cost to rent vehicle vs pro movers vs self haul? Include gas & munchies.

Find a city that's a maybe for you: must have job openings, and places to rent/sleep. Go visit it for a day or two if possible. (I visited a city I might have gone to...more bars than churches with <10k people ew). If you like that place, estimate one month's expenses - rent, elec, insurance for car and rent, internet, heat, gas...and save 3x that to jump.

Friends will trickle in, especially if you move to a place that has things you like - remember I said jives with culture and like the city? Don't expect buddies right off the bat. 

I did the thing you ask about: I jumped from a city to another place, had the cash saved up, and felt great. Made friends in time and met my bf. This is not silly. You're young. LIVE. Get out and do shit; work and save but enjoy new places, new things."
