Sometimes I have no control at all and I take a time out for that day and I allow myself time to just exist. 
I'm not happy with myself or my past decisions 90% of the day sometimes and existing is very uncomfortable for me.

I had to learn how to live differently and only saw how severe my PTSD was after I stopped drinking. It's been a hard battle to find normalization and my sleep is still wonky as hell, but my head is clear and I can stick to my priorities and upkeep things I would totally ignore before.

But my take was that they've seen someone who has checked out/given up. And I can see how that's a slap in the face to the average person, riding the train, who works all week and cant afford that selfish decision themselves.

It might be my PTSD as well, but I've been working on the big disconnect I feel from most people and its helping me be more social slowly, instead of giving up on people. 
Lately I feel so far from meeting someone, but in reality I'm very picky of who even catches my eye and I've been very selective of my acquaintances even. 
I feel like all I want to do is live my best life and to find a close companion has been ridiculously more difficult than I could've imagined. But I'm learning how to navigate this and to not forget all the good and amazing things I have to offer. I've been really hard on myself which dosen't help.

I quit drinking mainly because I wanted to eliminate the chaos that always crept into my life. So far it's been a slam dunk, mission accomplished in the almost 8 months. 

You're definitely not kidding about the new emotions, boredom and not feeling myself this whole time. Stopping suddenly made me see why I was drinking and how drinking both helped the symptoms but hindered my life. My PTSD and mental illness threw monkey wrenches in my suffering. But it's a timely process and slowly I've been regaining all aspects of myself back and been lots easier to engage in life and not be so bored, I'm getting there. But it's a slow process but it does end is what it's looking like on my end. It's taking me a lot longer than most to recover though because of my illnesses.

This last month I think I've been questioning if it has been worth it the most and so far I really do love the lifestyle and making sober decisions 24/7. 
It wasnt till after I stopped that I noticed why I drank and how well booze was at numbing my emotions and calming my anxiety and making me social. Now I have to find that norm for myself again. But I'm getting to the root of my problems this way instead of only covering them up. 
My PTSD and mental illness symptoms have flared way up, but now have been returning to a manageable level.

Currently I just smoke pot, but I would tell people that cigarettes were my drug of choice by far. But I've been happy that life is normal without cigs and that it's rare that I get an urge or think about them at all. The booze however, life hasn't yet gone back to the same without it.

alcoholism,eto8ko6,t3_cckymy,1563018936.0,"I was surprised when I withdrew very hard for months. I didn't see a lot of my different relationships with alcohol  till I stopped. I stopped because I wanted to regain control over my life and eliminate the chaos that always seemed to creep in. I didn't even notice how great drinking is for anxiety, not dealing with mental health issues and numbing all emotions. But I only realized this recently after doing a concert. There was so much different about the experience and I actually noticed I had my usal social anxiety and I had to deal with my PTSD triggers. I didn't realize how great alcohol is at numbing all those problems. 

But drinking brings many more problems than avoiding my own problems. I have quit drinking and highly recommend it. By quitting, it has eliminated all those other problems that alcohol brings into ones life. I was very close to losing everything I had and while I was drinking, i still didn't realize how formed my habit was at the time. 

After the first month, month and a half though, it got really rough and terrible. The time is on pause and what happened to me was that my mental illness and PTSD got inflamed and came back hard. I'm still dealing with flashbacks and triggers 7 months later, but I feel like I'm getting to the root of my problems and I have matured a ton in this process.  But it is doable and it involves not picking up a drink. Life, while more real and vibrant, is more meaningful and worthwhile than I have ever truly felt before. I look myself in the mirror and not have to worry if that small confidence in myself is real or not. The best thing for me is making sober decisions in my life 24/7 is amazing and has been giving me a real, new foundation to build off of.

I really like your advice about allowing myself to be wounded and time to heal is important. I'm very hard on myself, something that I'm also trying to work on. But what I walked away thinking was this will be my last concert till November (I have tickets for my favorite band then).

Fortunately I'm in treatment with a therapist and psychiatrist and my mania didn't manifest itself again. But I've been trying to look at things big picture, like just because I'm struggling in one area (cognitively) doesn't mean I'm struggling in all areas of life and personal goals. And just because it's a bigger obstacle at certain times dosen't mean it's an obstacle in everything all the time.

It was after I stopped drinking that the true reasons of why I was drinking came to light. I was numbing all my emotions down and because there has been a lot of pain in my life, I was running from dealing with unconcluded hurt emotions and by stopping drinking, yes I had to address all this.

And my illness does progress with triggers being stress and anxiety and change especially. I can only speak for myself though because it is a very complex disease and I dont know too much at all about the bipolar aspect. 

I would have to say In my opinion your comment seems very correct"
schizoaffective,esge8pt,t3_c7maro,1561950518.0,"Correct me if I'm wrong but are you asking if the disease is different than the person? I'm schizoaffective and have PTSD so for me it has always been so difficult to separate the symptoms and I have recently started to look at it in the lense that it does affect my life. In my situation, I'm on meds. It's when my anxiety gets high and that I have to watch my depression. It's when my anxiety and depression are very high that my mania comes out. So to me and the way I've been looking at things recently and how much I do in reaction to my symptoms. But being untreated is another animal imo and I know I've done things in episodes that I would never do if I was healthier."
schizoaffective,ese6vn9,t1_ese4051,1561884599.0,"Thanks, yes I definitely have and am seeing a dr and therapist. Thanks for saying that I'm not lonely for having those great things in my life. When I was boozing it never felt like my true support was never enough, or more taken for granted. Now I want my life to revolve around those things and I get a lot of satisfaction from it now"
schizoaffective,ese6ocq,t1_esdwcxm,1561884291.0,"Thanks for reminding me that things do get really upside down before it lifts a little. I do see a psychiatrist and therapist and this past year have been taking the meds religiously. This week I'm going to be exploring these things with my therapist and they seem to have an idea going forward. 

It's just been so fresh without numbing myself and what the real problems are, are much more clear. By seeing the problems more clearly I freak out and dont want to sit with it at all, but now that I'm working on new habits, I know I've been here before and it will take work to get where I want with my illness. I'm on a good path with professionals guiding me and I will get to achieving again."
schizoaffective,ese693s,t1_esdhhw1,1561883645.0,"Oh absolutely it has been. The positives just keep coming and it has been making me that better version of myself. It's been a huge process and everything feels new and uncertain, but everyday theres so much progress and the booze was killing me. also I was losing my control over my environment and by making non sober decisions I was unknowingly allowing so much chaos into my life. That has all stopped and I'm getting a new life going. I had no idea one decision could be so great. But I haven't looked at my illness sober in almost a decade, so its overwhelming at the moment. But so, so worth it."
confession,esbqgdd,t3_c6uehb,1561806684.0,"I can relate to how I felt at 28 and survived 27, I'm 32 now. Not the same I'm sure but definitely a victory and win. Congrats and so amazing.
Just something I've noticed over time...

That things and life never stay the same. The nature of life is change and the things that were my whole world are either non issues in my life now or have a completely different relationship with it in my life now. That's how it's been with everything.

But keep rocking it."
mentalillness,esbnlxs,t3_c6ppf9,1561802167.0,"Thank you for the support!!
I plan on keeping it going for a lifetime. I was fortunate enough that I got a clear picture of how bad things are. I was working on getting the extra chaos outta my life that I always seem to invite in, when i noticed it was the decisions i made while intoxicated that was the real problem. So I knew I had to make a change. So my determination has been outstanding and really got me through.  Also focusing on the positives of not drinking still helps. And now instead of being content with everything slowly sliding downwards, I'm working on things and trying to better myself again. But it's that void of emotions that needs to be worked through so I can fill my day up and not feel like I'm running away from things. It's so different being sober 100% of the day and to actually see and feel what's the problem. But a huge positive is that I can see what to do about it. Or at least realize something is there even if theres nothing I can do. But at least I know where to try and put effort now."
mentalillness,es9jo1g,t3_c65fqg,1561737738.0,"Thank you for the kind words and support. It has been a real obstacle but without the alcohol I feel I can get more to the root of my mental illness instead of ignoring it and having it blow up on me over time, every time. 

I can accept that life is always an ongoing process and my symptoms change from time to time. To me it's always about keeping trying to be the most comfortable I can be in my own skin. And I'm here more recently to figure out my symptoms and make sure another trauma doesn't come out and get some more sure footing as I continue on my journey without my huge crutch of alcohol. 

Thanks for making me feel welcomed here."
stopdrinking,erx1yha,t1_erwlvje,1561367668.0,"I think you summed it up well with the, ""it dosen't stop being hard, but it keeps getting better."" I really dont know where i got my attitude this first time around, but noticing and counting the positives is really weird how there is so many. 
I have relapsed once, but what was odd and telling was that instead of having one or two when I relapsed, I went straight for the 10. That relapse helped me in so many ways and it helped me to know what's ahead if I kept on that path.
What I've found really odd about the healing process is how I would have weeks of bad days and right before a permanent good shift, it would get so bad before it would lift a little and get better.
You're right about the sober experience and having just more sober experiences helps build a foundation. I think the concerts I did recently showed me how big picture the gains and losses of keeping sober really are a little more and I did have to recommit while being terrified of doing things without my crutch. But I did it and felt the most me I have in years and have plans to do another one here in early july. It's hard being open to all new and I give you so much credit to your sobriety.
It's still all fresh, new and frightening, but my day has begun to stop creeping by and I feel I can work on getting a hold of my anxiety and trauma symptoms with a little work again. It got so bad there and unmanageable and life was so hard to function in, but at it's worse, it just lifted and it's been just easier being me and existing. 
Thanks for all the support Sprout, I think I'm going to start posting here a lot less and start commenting more. I have a whole lot of damage to undo with my future, but I feel this freedom from suffering is a huge corner to turn. Will see what happens as I continue AA and have more sober experiences."
stopdrinking,ersclse,t3_c3kxtr,1561209724.0,"Instead of looking ahead, taking it one day at a time has helped me tremendously. 
I have a nasty habit of beating myself up and lately I've been getting hammered by bouts of fatigue. I've been allowing myself to indulge in anything healing and as long as I didn't drink today, the rest of my life will fall into place in good time. For me, making sober decisions 24/7 is making my life already completely different in such a positive way. 
There's always tomorrow to perfect things and play monday quarterback, but the fact is we are making huge positive changes in our lives and the new habits will get normalized with time and healing, is how I've been looking at it"
stopdrinking,ere3tzx,t1_ercooc8,1560772471.0,"I saw someone on here or r/jambands recently who did a music festival sober. 
At 6.5 months sober I'm glad I did a concert first. So much was different. But with time and getting used to new habits I could see myself doing a music festival in a couple years or so. It's totally doable I say"
stopdrinking,ere3o7f,t1_erc689k,1560772286.0,"Yes!!! It was an amazing thing when I came home after both nights and I actually had things that would last (shirts) and STILL had extra cash. Doing these shows made me realize how different my habits are, and how much I need to keep at sobriety to get the things I want out of it. 
Hope you enjoyed the shows!!! It was a little off for me, for being such great shows, I think I still have healing up to do. Everything about this concert experience was new. But I enjoyed everything I got out of it."

I so look forward to being 100% present when the music plays and my memory is so much more on point, its ridiculous.

I thank God everyday that I've made this decision to turn my life around. I didn't realize how close I was to losing so, so much. It's been a week of coming to terms with reality and learning how to deal with my emotions on high every moment.

Always appreciate your responses. I'm getting more at peace that getting up from what I didn't know before, but now do know it as rock bottom, is getting doable. Now that I've been confident that its doable it's just making peace with the process. Thanks for the reminder that life will fix this and that as time goes by, I will have a foundation and slowly crawl and work up from there. And just living sober i will be able to attain more esstemable acts. I need to make more meetings, I guess I've been more fixated with my therapist appointment and venting out my traumas. But I've added a substance abuse counselor that I see next week. That has taken the over thinking part of my days. I'm going to take some time and note some positives of this whole process.

The turning point was how I started to notice how my life was getting unmanageable no matter how much effort I put in to getting my environment under control, chaos always slipped it's way in. 
I was so tired of my life being uncontrollable.
