DarlingInTheFranxx,fr0udkp,t1_fr0u2b7,1589806960.0,Oh I know. Still dont care. They started around the same time and trigger went off on an alien bullshit tangent. Anime came out a day before the manga started I'm going fullmetal alchemist on this and if they just remade the series under a fmaB type thing I'd be fine. Manga is shorter but so much less shit.
DarlingInTheFranxx,fr0qiuj,t1_fr0qf5y,1589804128.0,I always consider manga endings to be true endings so I'm like meh about the anime ending.

politics,fjhbpnp,t1_fjhauho,1583345036.0,He did the opposite if he endorses biden. I dont know a single person under 35that voted for biden. And all of the ones that voted for bernie said fuck biden and they'd rather vote independent to show other Democrats that are older not to fuck with them and make people deal with 4 more years of trump. Yeah that much spite. Maybe because Hillary pissed bernie supporters off so much that they refuse to vote for anyone but bernie.
