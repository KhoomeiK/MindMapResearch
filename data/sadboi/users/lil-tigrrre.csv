BPD,fpv9p1v,t1_fpv9fmn,1588939402.0,"I see where your coming from. It is a debilitating illness & im sure if all of us could choose not to have it we would get rid of it ina heartbeat. But I think by making lists like this sometimes is a way of coping for some people, like it’s not all doom & gloom typa way. People never take us seriously & we get demonised all the time just because we are mentally ill. I think if people recognised our good traits more they might show us more respect."
BPD,fpv924t,t1_fpv29wo,1588938871.0,Dude chill. This person is only trying to find the positives. If you don’t like it you don’t have to read it. Let people be happy about things. For me a part of accepting that I have this illness is trying to find the positives without ignoring the negatives. This list probably doesn’t apply to most people but the fact that we have to live with bpd every single day & how unpredictable it is teaches us a lot I think.

The human race is gonna fail because of this mentality but I guess that’s a good thing the more of us that are wiped out the better condition the planet will be in. Factory farming needs to stop & the only way we can do that is by no longer consuming animal products & stop giving our money to factory farming.

BPD,fp1su00,t3_garanb,1588246766.0,It annoys me so much. Everywhere I go I see people diagnosing people they know who may have been abusive to them or that they dislike as being a narcissist. There’s even a subreddit dedicated to it. NPD is the cluster B with the most stigma around it definitely & my heart goes out to those who have been diagnosed / trying to recover. Because they get demonised a hell of a lot more than we do & it just isn’t right.
BPD,fp1si69,t1_fp14hny,1588246476.0,"Exactly. From my experience I have actually been told it’s a symptom of BPD. That’s what I was told by my psychiatrist when getting my diagnosis. Not that we hurt people exactly, but we lash out *because* we are in so much pain, & end up hurting people as a result. I say this all the time - “it’s not an excuse but it’s a reason”. There are many mental illnesses & I think mentally ill people in general are capable of hurting people, being manipulative, emotionally abusive etc. So yes it is a symptom. Let’s not prentend it isn’t. But it is *not* an excuse, imo. I think if you aren’t actively trying to get better for the sake of yourself & your loved ones you can’t be excused."
