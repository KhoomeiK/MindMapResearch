I understand that the subreddit is meant for conversations about depression, etc. But that was MY experience with depression. Apparently I was not valid in their community because I was able to overcome one suicidal episode.

When I cried, he said, “Let it all out.” and kept driving. He asked if he could rest his hand on mine, as he was driving as a form of consoling me. I said yes, despite being terrified by male touch. Something in me told me I could trust him. He then simply kept driving."

I actually plan to get us tickets to Japan so we can go visit the Pokémon Center in Tokyo for his birthday next year.

I think the thing that some people are in disagreement about is what he should do about B. 

When I first read this, I genuinely thought to myself that OP would have to be an absolute idiot to let a girl like this go. Seriously, what else do you need from her, OP? A baptism? None of the things he mentioned about B are flaws at all. It’s just his twisted scope of things, that are making him view these qualities in a negative light. “She’s a 10/10, brings me to tears from laughter, and is becoming a lawyer. But she also has her own well-thought-out views on religion, enjoys the occasional night out, and is well-traveled.” I fail to find what is disagreeable about any of that. I can’t believe no one has pointed out the obvious- OP, whether consciously or subconsciously, knows that B is far too good for him. (No air quotes, because this, I do believe)."

relationship_advice,fpdbzh2,t3_gctkno,1588523993.0,"You say that you are not trying to demean either of these girls, but this reminds me of that episode of FRIENDS where Ross compares Rachel and Julie. Although he speaks highly of both, he also scummily points out the flaws of both woman. 

Let me ask you this: if either of these girls knew that you laid out their qualities in this sort of manner and knit-picked their entire existences, would they still like you? Do they know that you are treating this like some episode of The Bachelor?

It seems that you are already in love with B. I think that you are trying to find any flaw possible in B in order to justify settling for A. Don’t choose B if you are not ready to accept her for who she is. And do not settle for A if there is a girl who is clearly capable of making you feel so much more than she ever has.


Edit- I said it somewhere down below, but B sounds like an absolute catch. That kind of badassery does not play well with fragile egos. You said she is fiery, and it doesn’t seem like you are ready for that heat. Let’s not ignore A either. She deserves better. Just because she is not an Instagram model and doesn’t command a room in the same way as B, does not mean that you had any right to minimize her to a “dull, safe” choice. To someone, she will be perfect. Clearly it is not you."

The feeling of waking up and something, that once brought so much joy, no longer giving me that same type of gratification, does the same thing to my mental health, as someone leaving does.

Advice,fpaap4o,t3_gcb8db,1588444250.0,"I think a compliment is a compliment. I don’t base the worth of a compliment on someone else’s appearance. Though, usually compliments mean more to me when they come from strangers, conventionally attractive or not- only because it takes courage to go up to a complete stranger and offer kind words like that. If someone overcame such an uncomfortable obstacle to extend a compliment your way, you know that they truly mean it.

Back to your question- imagine thinking that you need to be skilled at art to appreciate art. Or, thinking you must be a skilled musician in order to admire music. That’s far from the truth. Just because someone is not conventionally attractive does not mean that they don’t have taste in what is."
depression,fp4e9od,t3_gb8ysx,1588297187.0,"Have you ever spoken to a therapist, OP? Is there some sort of trigger that brings on these thoughts, or is it constant? 

I will occasionally get into slumps where I feel absolutely worthless. In those moments, I have the urge to push people away. I’ve realized with age that despite my strong desire to marinate in my depressive thoughts and be left alone, that this is, in fact, counterintuitive. People will remind you of the positive, beautiful qualities that you possess, which you cannot currently see because your mind is clouded by the negative things that your depression has convinced you that you are. 


When you don’t feel like enough, try to remember that you are. And if that is not enough, remember that asking for reassurance and reinforcement from those around you is always okay."
depression,fp4b23d,t3_gaxui1,1588295288.0,"No one will likely see this, but it feels nice to have a forum where I can express this, without having to actually verbally convey it. I heavily relate to this post, and seeing that others do, too, brings me a sense of comfort that I am not alone, but mostly just makes my heart ache.

I have battled depression since I was 11 years old (following a sexual assault from a family member). Shortly after, I began dissociating. 

Over a decade later, and I have become an absolute shell of a person. I prefer not to go out and waste time at events, social gatherings, etc., because I cannot manage to live in the moment (no matter how hard I try). My brain and body are just not on the same wavelength, ever. Anything I do, I cannot recollect the next day because although I was physically present, my mind was absent. 

I have pushed family, significant others, and former friends away because I do not believe I am capable of existing normally, and it severely upsets me to think that I am wasting anyone’s time or energy. While they are able to enjoy life in the moment, I cannot. So I believe I am doing everyone a favor by living in my dull little bubble. 

With my depression and dissociation, I believe that I am destined to live a life of mere survival: wake up, eat, work, sleep, repeat. I cannot fathom that others can simply wake up and experience life to its fullest, let alone enjoy it. I am envious, but very happy for them nonetheless."

AskReddit,fnaz4sd,t3_g0ij6y,1586806387.0,"An incredibly smart, but cocky, guy I go to the same university as posted something on his social media along the lines of how he “can beat anyone within a 50 mile radius in chess.” He didn’t know my extensive background in chess (I used to compete throughout all of grade school, and have a shelf full of chess trophies from local, state, and national competitions). To him, I was just a dumb girl who he sat next to in a few classes. 

I privately messaged him and said that I could take him. He messaged me back, essentially laughing at the idea. I told him that regardless of what he thought, I would like to play him. He told me, “Fine. But my time is money. So, let’s put $50 down on this.” I felt sort of bad, because he really thought that he was going to gyp me out of $50. 

We met up later that day to play. As the game progressed, I slowly saw the look of astonishment on his face, as it dawned on him that he, in fact, gypped himself. When I finally checkmated him, he admitted that he did not have $50 on him, as he did not expect to lose. I laughed, and told him that it was alright; I did not want the money. The satisfaction of knocking the smug look off of his face was enough.

When I got home that evening, I received an unexpected Venmo payment of $50 from him. I then sent him a photo of my shelf, with all of my chess trophies. We had a good laugh, and he actually ended up asking me out on a date a few weeks later. I told him that I don’t go out with guys who can’t beat me in chess.

We remain friends, and he has yet to beat me in chess."
Tinder,flu3m41,t3_fqjbad,1585494459.0,"I'm going to play devil's advocate here. 

Including my Instagram in my profile was a way that people looking at me could see more of me, if they were interested. Tinder profiles don't really provide me with a sense of the person, so I always appreciate when someone includes their Instagram handle. It's an easy way to get a better feel of who you may or may not swipe right on. The biggest red flag for me is if they include their IG handle, but their profile is private. Or, if they have photos of a significant other on their Instagram.

TL/DR: Not everyone who includes their Instagram handle in their bio sucks!
