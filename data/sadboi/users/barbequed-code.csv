I think this is the best advice.

Along the lines of demonising her, idk, it'll help the grieving process for sure, but will also put a demon on your back. Sure, you'll have fight with this demon much later(or perhaps never), and it'll be an easier fight for sure, just tryna give a little warning.

The comfort-agent I'd suggest is, hey, at least you had the good times too, there are people who never have those good times ever. Yes, it's love lost, or love that was never even there, BUT t'was an experience yeah ?

math,fr2fx2r,t1_fr2chwt,1589836593.0,">The (co)domain of a set function has to be a set, but the (co)domain of a class function may be a proper class.  For example, your category A isn't small, so its class of objects isn't a set, but we can still define a function that sends a pair of objects (x, y) to their hom set Hom(x, y).

I was considering this assignment to be a functor(from AxA to Set) yes, but not a function, again because the domain won't be a set. Because I didn't know about the  the notion of a 'class function'.

>And in the statement of the Yoneda lemma Hom(Ha, X) isn't assumed to be a set;

The [text I'm following](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.09375.pdf), considers \[a,Set\](Ha,X) to be a set ( last three lines on pg 95,) at the very beginning of the proof, right before the define the bijection. And not being comfortable with classes, I'd rather like to understand that text's argument as it doesn't (directly )invoke axiom schema of replacement. I'm guessing that the author makes do with the axiom of pairing and union(implicit in Section 3).

If the aforementioned book isn't wrong, I'd really really like to understand it's point of view. Else, exactly why it is wrong, i.e. a counterexample.

&#x200B;

P.S:

>No matter how you formalize classes it will turn out that if two classes A and B are in bijection and A is a set then B is also a set.

But, in that case, I can't define a function from (or to) it. The definition of a function requires the domain (and co-domain) to be sets (afaik)."

I'd say, be yourself, unless it could hurt someone. If its physical hurt we talking bout, then be someone else. If its emotional hurt, then kinda murky, but say if i can completely avoid hurting them by being someone else, then I'd do that. If it won't matter too much, then I'd be true to myself.

My reasoning behind this is simply the subjectivity of good. Like, some people think I'm being bad by not vying to become a civil servant because that's THE good path. And I think I'd be good only by not following that road because I'm too indifferent to people's suffering. To make matters worse, self awareness of this kinda subjectivity makes one go a level deeper, and consider whether doing morality calculus via most popular systems, and averaging it out (say it's possible in realtime) would be the best possible plan of action, but then this thought seems plausible only because the morality calculus path seems neutral, but then, certain ppl think it to be much more immoral than a naive approach, and we go into the rabbit hole."
