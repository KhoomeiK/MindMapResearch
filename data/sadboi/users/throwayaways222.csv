BPD,fqidwm4,t3_gj1dvv,1589394697.0,"So weird, I had this exact situation happen to me, like word for word. I stared at his picture for about 30 seconds just trying to register it was him - and then immediately *mildly* fell apart. It helped me to think that he was probably only on the app to boost his confidence, to help him not be so lonely - and hey, how often does tinder produce an actual relationship? I know if feels like a shock, and I wish I had better advice - but you have everything you need within you, and radical acceptance, yeah, you saw your ex on tinder, it is what it is.
Sending love to you !!"

You are allowed to take as long as you want to get over someone, you are working on your own timeline. i hope things get better for you soon!"
