depression,fjxxl2b,t3_ff6w7x,1583685660.0,"I'm probably going to get crucified for this, but I hate to see people suffering so much from loneliness. I suffer from depression and I completely agree with the title, but I think when we feel hurt about what others do (or not do), to the point it worsens depression, it's more about ourselves than about others. I used to have a ""I only have shitty friends who don't really care about me"" attitude, and felt miserable over a simple ""seen"" message. But it helped a lot to realise that people have their lives, and I am waaay down their priority list, just as a lot of people are in mine. So I decided to turn my attention to those who actually give a damn: my sister and SO (met online, context for later). No one else has worked.

Please, I'm not saying you should be happy to be friendless; some of us can handle solitude better, some of us are not that good. What I'm saying, is that you should first turn your attention to those who matter, starting with, you guessed it, yourself. Learn what you like or not like. Do you hate being ignored? Do you dislike people who only talk about themselves? Or do you like people who talk about themselves a lot? What do you like? What would you like? And then rid yourself of those who just put you down and make you feel bad. It's not selfishness it's self love. Avoid people and situations that only drag you further down. And last but not least, what are you giving to other people? Why are you being ignored? Why are you being left out? And why you shouldn't be? Try meeting people online first, you'll find there are more people who understand, even if you can't hang out immediately; just having conversations helps, and you get slightly more confident in the friendship department. 

Please consider this, your ""friends"" are not a measure of who you are. You're much more interesting than you think you are, spend time with yourself (trying a hundred different things, reading whatever you want; doesn't matter if you stick to only one thing or none, or if depression comes back - it will), just give yourself a bit more credit. It hurts to chase friendships, cut that, you're not behind anyone's crumbs, what? No. There are limits.

Edit: better context."

When you start to get to know yourself better and to enjoy the thousand things you can do by yourself, you barely have time to notice people are not around. And relationships slowly start flowing more naturally, for some reason. People who are not really your friends, will eventually disappear (which is good, believe me), and your real friends will be there no matter what. I've been there, lost several ""friends"", and now people have to really offer me a better deal than my own company for me to consider them important. And don't be scared of that, you won't ""die alone"", you'll still find the right people, but they're much less than you may like right now."

The creepy part comes when the flirting doesn't stop after you SAY SOMETHING (like you pointed out). Which happens pretty often, and I'm sure not only to me or only to women. 
No one's shaming guys for flirting, the whole point is that SOME people will take the flirting to creepy extents. And because you only have a life, why should you put up with shit from someone you don't like anyway? You certainly have zero clue as to what an awkward moment could really be.

Advice,fgm1xh2,t3_ezavzh,1580916308.0,"I think right now the best option is to talk to him about this whole situation. I don't know how long have you been together, but with the info provided, he doesn't seem to be much of a terrible person, meaning, he wouldn't leave you homeless if you openly ask for his support (I think). It's just a matter of connection between the two of you. I'd say you should be as open with him, and tell him you don't want to hurt him or yourself, that you could really use his help for the next 6-8 months so you can settle, and will do your best to return the favour.

I know it's difficult to ask for this, but your situation is delicate and if he happens to break up with you first, you may have lost any chance of getting his support, and if you ask for his help once it's over he may even feel you've been utilising him since who knows when and he may resent this. But by talking to him now, and being honest, it could be another story.

Like I said, easier said than done, but it doesn't have to happen in the same conversation. Try to get him to tell you what he really feels about the relationship, and if your suspicions are right, this can also help him feel less 'betrayed', by facing the fact that he isn't too into it either.

My two cents."

I think any gender can be as visual. It's not right or wrong to reject someone based on looks, people have their way to choose a partner. Personally, I'm the type who can skip looks for a killer personality, but I hate that women are seen as shallow bitches when they don't like a guy based on physical appearance. Men, on the other hand are generally not seen as shallow if they reject a girl based on this.
