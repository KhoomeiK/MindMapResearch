bipolar,fkmwcjh,t1_fkltiog,1584342654.0,"manic episode can be really exciting, it feels like you are smarter, faster, better, but it has serious downsides: your judgment is poor right now and lack of sleep is serious issue, that can lead to serious damage to your body and you do not want to have serious damage, do You? That is the reason why we should be on the meds, I think You are right if you are feeling that meds are workink poorly for You and You should go to Your doctor ASAP and tell him about it, he will give you some pills for sleep (and antimanic pills).

but we are sick and things like this tends to happen.  


Try not to be so harsh on yourself, it is not easy, but you deserve at least understanding.  
If she told You that it is over, then You have to accept that and move with all this shit.  
Eventually, it will get better, but it will not be pleasant time, but it will be better, it always is.

ps. I have deleted post to avoid weak advices like ""break up"" - come on, we are happy together and love each other, that was mentioned in post btw. The only thing was my curiosity what do you think about it, since I miss meeting new people, but as you can see - not more than I love my gf."

Secondly, it is not so easy as you think, problem is that I really ove her and we are happy together, the only thing is that I miss sex with other people, but that doesn't mean that I do it against her will. It is easy to say ""break up"" and really weak advice - have you read that we are happy together?Next point is, that our relationship wasn't monogamous in the beggining.

There is whole r about polyamory, do you thing all of them are selfish? nope.

why r INTJ - because I thought You will understand me more than average people, but I was wrong - people on r polyamory was much more understanding.

I have deleted post to avoid hate and anger.

ps. my girlfriend know about it, we are loving each other and talked about it lot's of time, it is just way that I am, it is sad that you hate me so much but what can I do.  


ps2. I love her more than sex with other, that's why we are still together, why so mean.."

what if we have a 300kg guy - if he would eat 1.3-1.8g/kg on body fat free mass, that would give him really low % of proteins, in total calories intake. Will it be still ok?
