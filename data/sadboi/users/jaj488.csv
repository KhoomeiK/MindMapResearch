BipolarReddit,fqglsin,t3_giqsfd,1589349764.0,"Going through the exact same thing. I was a college student studying abroad and was essentially deported. College was huge for me, episodes still here and there, but after an awful high school experience and the worst episodes of my life, along with being properly medicated and therapy, I was the happiest I'd ever been. And once that was torn away and the thoughts that my upcoming senior year might be screwed as well, well it's gotten to me like it has for you.

I completely understand when you say its bringing up memories of past episodes. I'm back home with my family, and without getting into it, a lot of the worst episodes of my life were caused by serious issues with my family. So being stuck with the people, save my mom, who traumatized me as a kid is really tough and has reopened some old wounds. It's frustrating. I was the happiest I have ever been by a long shot, and its almost as if I was sent back in a time machine. It really gets to me at night. I talk to friends throughout the day on facetime and what not and it distracts me enough, but once I'm alone it all sets in. I can't sleep, keep thinking about past episodes. I have issues with anxiety too, and I'm having panic attacks on a nightly basis. I cry at least once a day, basically a mental breakdown a day. This is a long way of saying you're not alone.

I'm scared too. It feels like I'm running towards the worst of the worst and I can't stop. As for what's helped me, I've started making some choices to better myself once I come out of quarantine. Make some goals for yourself. I've always been a bigger guy, so I've started running almost every day and eating healthier. Checking my weight every morning and seeing it consistently go down is the best part of my day. I think to the future, once I'm back in school and I show up a whole new me and stunting on everyone haha. It helps having something to latch onto. I can so easily fall into what I call the ""corona hole"", thinking of all the things I've lost, but I know how hard it can be, but try to think of all the things you can gain. Come out of this with a new skill maybe? Pick up an instrument, learn a language, think that once you're out of this, even if you fall into a bad episode, that there's things that give a bit of light at the end of the tunnel. 

So yeah, it might sound obvious but fine something to distract yourself. Not a one off thing like watching a TV show, but something you can consistently build on and hopefully that'll be enough to get you through the tough times ahead or hopefully not ahead. Stay strong and if you ever want to talk feel free to message me. You can do it, hoping for the best."

I then went back to just classes and slowly added back other parts of my life to what I could handle. And while I do less than I do before, I can manage it now. You’ve got this!"
AskReddit,fi5ync2,t3_f6nncc,1582173732.0,"A kid got caught stealing phones from the locker room we used for P.E. Some kids caught him and chased him down, until our campus cop got wind and tried to stop him. The kid punches the cop in the face, but I mean he was a big cop and it didn't really do much. The kid tried to run away and in the struggle I guess the cop grabbed at his bag or some other way opened. 

Preface, cocaine was big at our high school. When his bag spilled open, bags of cocaine spilled out into our quad. Turns out he was stealing phones and selling them to fund his coke operation. We weren't allowed onto the quad for a couple days, since it turned into a crime scene."
AskReddit,fi5yao9,t3_f6nm1t,1582173462.0,"I was I think 16, just going for a walk around the neighborhood when I saw and heard a man and a woman fighting just out on the sidewalk. They were nearby a car, and at first it was just a very heated argument. Then the man grabbed the woman's arm and started forcefully pulling her towards the car, all the while she was yelling at him. He pushed her up against the car door and that's when I decided to just walk away.

I walked for another couple minutes, and my conscience took over and I walked back, not really knowing what I would do. By the time I got back they and the car were gone. I think about it a lot. Was she stuck in an abusive relationship? What happened to her after? Did he hurt her worse than what I saw? I still think about it sometimes. I should've called the cops or something. I should have done something."

AskReddit,fi4eby9,t3_f6fkuo,1582139467.0,"Never learned how to use chopsticks. Every time I go out to Asian restaurants I pray they have forks already at the table. Sometime when I ask, they bring me a fork no problem. One time they brought me the training tool they let 5 year olds use on the chopsticks, all while the staff and my friends were laughing. Another time our waitress was gone for like 10 minutes and when she finally came back, she had a tiny plastic fork she must have fished out from the back. Literally did not have forks.

If they're the ones where you have to break them apart, then sometimes I'll keep them together and pull them apart slightly to pick up the food, so I don't have to deal with the embarrassment."

It explains it. After episodes I generally have to go on an apology tour because I recognize the wrong I did. Wrong is wrong whether or not you have a mental illness.

That being said, it sounds like she's incredibly stressed with a newborn around as well. But the constraints, limitations, and costs being placed on you in your own home is too much. Bottom line the living situation isn't ideal for either of you, and it's well within your right to move out."

It makes perfect sense that he would be nervous about telling his future in laws these things. You said the parents didn't show up. Did you ever stop to think that he *didn't even invite them* because of his past? Your daughter and her husband were worried about how you'd react and you went and proved them right.

You're a dad, you have a right to worry. But doing it on your daughter's day? You're going to have a hell of a time fixing this. You might not. Ever."

AmItheAsshole,fi49zmn,t3_f6evqs,1582136955.0,"NTA. You blacked out after 2 shots? If something didn't feel right and you blacked out it sounds like its possible you were drugged. It sounds like you're ok with the encounter you had with the guy you slept with, so I don't want to assume anything, but given the events before and then waking up in a stranger's bed is a little suspicious.

But outside of that, your friend defended you saying that you did look after her and if the other girls didn't do anything then they have no room to talk. But be safe OP, blacking out after 2 shots isn't normal."

AmItheAsshole,fi3fqa0,t1_fi3ffu7,1582116403.0,"I see where you’re coming from now, and while it could be possible he has severe anxiety, I don’t think him blurting out answers is enough to diagnose the guy. Is it not also possible he is just obnoxious? Not saying that for certain either. I don’t think a professor in psychology would diagnose a kid based on one symptom. 

A lot of people are calling him the asshole because they believe the possible scenario in which he could be an asshole is true. People violate social norms all the time, hence we call them assholes or otherwise. This sub is literally full of people violating social norms.

But like others and you have said, there are other possibilities, which is why now I agree going to the professor is the right move. I just don’t think it’s fair to assume he has severe anxiety when there’s other possibilities."

AmItheAsshole,fi38d4m,t1_fi2rv60,1582105991.0,"What makes you think he's dealing with severe anxiety? I agree with others saying he may have a learning disability, which was assholish of me not to consider. But what about it makes you think anxiety? If anything it seems he's quite confident. And my main issue isn't him talking so much. It's the constant interruption to the flow of the class and him taking away other opportunities for other students to speak. Because often we have the same ideas and there's often only one correct answer to the professor's question. And for him to just blurt it out, kinda sucks for the rest of us who were raising our hand. Again though, there's the possibility it's something that's difficult for him control, in which case approaching him would be mega asshole territory."

I guess maybe she could make like a class wide rule? I'm just trying to think of ways to get the message through to him without singling him out."

It's that he constantly interrupts the professor, and contributes in a rude manner. If he raised his hand like everyone else did, waited to be called on, and contributed the same amount I would not have a problem because at that point it's at the professor's discretion. It's not the amount, it's the way he does it. But as others pointed out there could be a reason for it."
