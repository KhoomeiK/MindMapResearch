toronto,fqyc7f2,t1_fqy83mx,1589746231.0,"Look at golf... Tiger Woods doesn’t negate golfs’ whiteness, the same way Obama didn’t make America not have racists. You’re making specifics about golf within the City of Toronto, while I’m discussing golf as a sport in general. You can get Panthers season seats for less than a round at Pebble Beach, but I’m not going to go to absurdity. 

According to the City of Toronto, “Toronto has over 110 indoor and outdoor ice pads, natural rinks and trails for leisure skating.” I’m sure I could find the statistics, but I’m sure all of these entertain and employing more people per square foot (as I said before). 

I agree cities shouldn’t put money into stadiums and Toronto hasn’t. When the Dome was built it was owned and operated by the city. They did a crap job of doing so and Rogers got a sweetheart deal. That isn’t the same as “giving half a billion... to build a stadium” (they just gave away a prebuilt well used stadium, which was stupid). When BMO was built with city money Tim Lewicki of MLSE was insistent it remained owned by the city even if operated by MLSE. All the seat expansions since have been paid for by MLSE. 

I actually agree that if there is going to be golf (and it’s not like I’m getting rid of it... I’m a dude on Reddit) there needs to be public golf. The major issue with the “white elitism” is private courses with selective membership. It creates a pay for access type environment that encourages plutocracy."

Police have been punished (publicly or not) for speaking out on force issues. Over a decade ago attempted to interview a family friend who’s part of TPS for a school project. The amount of red tape for a simple project was astronomical. This culture of secrecy has only increased.

Stat Projecting is more long term, but can be EXTREMELY profitable. Every other Friday (once the season starts... sigh) they update the Live Series cards stats.
