PostureTipsGuide,fq9r3rr,t1_fq9q0gh,1589205288.0,"A chiropractor can help, but he cant do 100% of the job, and to prevent it getting worse you should definitely do something.

So the knee is a dumb joint. It just does what the feet do. The knees should be over the feet, not on the inside. If you rotate your feet towards supination, your knees should follow that. Maybe its a little exhausting to hold the knees over the feet, but your muscle and energy can be rebuilt, you bones cant (at least not fully).

Its very easy if youve understand it. 

Id recommend you to do squats with your own bodyweight to get used to it. For that, take a shoulder wide stance. Your feet and knees should be pointing a little to the outside (however its comfortable). Then when you go down, remember to keep your back ""straight"" but don't let too much weight on your knees. Your knees shouldn't be too far pushed out front. Youll know what too far means, Ive youve tried it.

And very helpful is to learn the difference between pain, because of effort (like working out) and pain because of destruction (like breaking your arm)"

PostureTipsGuide,fq99cxb,t3_ghb78b,1589190320.0,"You seem to have flat feet.

Its a disbalance between the outside and the inside of the foot. Try to stretch the outside (like if you would stand on your ankle with your foot on the inside). And strengthen the inside with walking on your foot pad (the front part where your toes are attached.

So basically when you stand your foot should be more like a bridge. Touching the ground everywhere except in the middle and to the inside.

You can just hold your foot in the air and relax it. Its probably going to ""fall"" into the right position.

Id recommend going running. Run only on the front of the foot, your heel shouldnt touch the ground. Since you use another joint that way, you dont overuse your legs."
