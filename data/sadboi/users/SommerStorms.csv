BipolarReddit,fpf7wwb,t3_gd28bk,1588563943.0,A few things.  Thank goodness you have better healthcare than you do here in the US.  I know this may seem like a trying time and your dreams of service have been shattered but at the same time you’ve found out your diagnosis and can now focus on the treatment you need.  There is a big world out there and I’m sure you’ll accomplish great things.  Bipolar individuals have higher iqs on average and think outside the box.  You can do this.  If you need a friend I’m here.  I was diagnosed 10+ years ago so I’ve been through the ringer

I don’t want to date someone with kids.  I only find a grey area in dating someone who has grown children.  By that I mean adult, financially responsible for themselves offspring.  I MIGHT consider that.

Edit I’m 39 so I guess that’s important to mention here."

- Take your medications as prescribed.  If you have trouble remembering use an alarm on your phone or get a daily pill organizer that has a timer.  You can find them on amazon.  
- Track your moods!!!   There are apps but personally I keep a separate journal for ups and downs vs daily journaling which is more in depth. 
- Exercise at least 30 min a day.  
- Eat healthy and well. Drink consistent amounts of water.  Eat consistent amounts of sodium.  Limit caffeine. Avoid drugs (marijuana, cocaine, heroin, ketamine, mdma) avoid alcohol or consume infrequently and in moderation.  Take a multivitamin with B complex. 
- Go to therapy.  
- Find a group - look up NAMI or RI International and get involved.  In my area NAMI has group twice a month and RI daily depending on what you’re looking for.  
- Be  of service to others (volunteer at one of the places or volunteer at an animal shelter or a senior living facility or anyplace that strikes your fancy - just find a way to help others).  
- Get out of the house - walk or hike or run or jog.  Get moving and out of your head.  
- Stick to a routine.  Get a planner and write it down.  I find writing it down is more helpful than using a phone.  Schedule your wake up times, work times, exercise times, shower etc.  Write in brushing your teeth or eating if it helps. I’m prone to not eating or over eating based on mood.  This helps. I color code mine because I think it makes it pretty but also helps me remember.  
- Have a pet if you can.  It will give you a sense of responsibility outside of yourself.  Even on my worst days I’ll make sure to feed my fur babies (one of them is diabetic and has kidney issues so no matter how awful I feel I still have to function for her shots) - a dog would help with the go on a walk point earlier but really even if it’s a beta fish it will keep you grounded. 
- reach out to friends and family at least once a week.  They don’t need to know what’s up daily but check ins help you both.  
- for the younger crowd - college can make or break you.  If you stumble the first time, keep trying. It took 9 years for me to get my bachelors.  Now I’m working on a masters.  You can do it.  If you need tips let me know.  Also know you can be fine without higher education.  It’s different for everyone.  

At this point I’m rambling.  I’ve taught classes for young adults with MI (anxiety, depression, BP, BPD, schizophrenia, ADD, ADHD, PTSD) for about four years now.  I’ve spoken at multiple seminars and am changing careers to psych.  I’m willing to talk to anyone (especially now with quarantine) about my story and I’m happy to listen to yours and advise where I can.

There have been many advancements from other countries that have made forward progress toward putting an end to this but I feel as though anything non-USA centric has fallen on deaf ears.  Researchers and scientists here have been reading studies and are doing their best but if Trump wants to cut us off I’m not surprised.  This man would rather us shove a metaphorical (okay let’s not joke he probably means literal) lightbulb up our asses and inject disinfectants to cure us.  The amount of dumbassery is breathtaking.  He has essentially said our choices for cures are hydroxychloroquine which has proven ineffective in multiple studies and could be causing MORE deaths, UV light therapy which at best will be ineffective and at worst cause cancer, or injecting disinfectants which 100% will put you in critical care or kill you.

Makeup just takes practice.  I don’t think I’m great but friends seem to think I’m good so we can swap techniques if you want.  Get good brushes and stay away from super pigmented shadows.  The more pigmented they are the less forgiving.   You want something you can build in the beginning.  It takes longer but if you’re new that’s the way to go.  For long multiplication.  Why bother.

It sounds like you need to sit down and really talk to find the source of his angst as you put it.  A couples counselor could help in this situation so you can work on communicating your needs and wants.
