EatingDisorders,f6s9mmc,t3_dqzcjg,1573130046.0,"In a way, my mom made me starts eating the usual ""weight loss"" amount when I was in 4th grade. I really became obsessed with it because I had already struggled for about 4 years earlier with body image and restricting foods ocassionally (throwing out a few things of lunch, only eating salad for dinner, skipping a birthday party)  but when my grandfather died it Triggered me further and my eating disorder went full blown. So in a way it did, because it opened me up to calorie counting at a really young age and eating way less than i should havr been at that age, which I continued with pretty religiously. It also made me obsessed with burning off the calories when i was in 4th grade."

electronic_cigarette,f6pmlka,t1_f6pii59,1573059670.0,"Thank you. People are so freaked out by the deaths that have occurred this past summer by people using mostly tainted thc. Not to mention apparently tainted PRE filled pods. Not nic salts or anything like that. Also, cigarettes kill a larger number of people each year than this ""vaping crisis"" has so far. I've been vaping for a year after I switch from smoking cigs. I feel a million times better since the switch. And when I get checked by the doctor, my heart, lungs, and blood pressure are all completely normal."
electronic_cigarette,f6pln4d,t3_dshuoh,1573059069.0,"I hope that this ends up being true. I'm an adult who vapes and although I don't mind the menthol flavor, certainly prefer menthol fruit flavors more. Vape shops normally check id's and don't sell to people who look underage and without id. So I think it would be safe to keep those stores open. With tighter regulation I believe that it could be smart to do so. It would save a huge amount of jobs as well as votes."
