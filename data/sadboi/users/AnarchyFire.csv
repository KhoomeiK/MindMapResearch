Currently unemployed and living at home, kind of wishing I had just killed myself like I had planned. But because someone intervened and called the cops, I'm here today, and I hate it.

Dedicated the last year to getting sober and working out. I see a dermatologist and despise all of the comments that I get like ""why don't you have a girlfriend?"" because they don't even understand all the bullshit I was put through. I don't want to get attention for my body now, when my personality was ignored all those years. My mentality is sour, but it doesn't matter because I guess I'm ""hot"" now. Figures, right?

The only solace I get is all of those who bullied me never left town, got fat, working dead end jobs, posting shit on FB, likely depressed and still addicted to drugs they thought were fun when they were young.

So why do I like to be alive? I don't. That's just reality. You think everyone is going to have a happy ending if they just believe enough, then you need to get out more and see what humans are doing to each other. And have done, and will continue to do. So go ahead and list ""listening to birds and drinking coffee"" and shit, because distractions are all there is."
AskReddit,fi2ydtr,t1_fi0eyf0,1582093216.0,"Had a worker try to peddle their store's credit scam on me, smiling aggressively like he wouldn't drag my entrails across 30 feet of broken glass for an ounce of vacation time. Wouldn't even give me an opening to refuse either. Just a long-winded paragraph about how their company will dangle a baby carrot for all my trouble, while Uncle Sam slips his hand into my back pocket.

By the time he was done, I said ""I'm not interested.""

He looks hurt, but says ""Okay.""

Then I hear him ask the next customer behind me ""Are you interested in hearing about \[this store's\] offer?"" to which she replies ""No thanks.""

And this mother fucker actually says ""No problem, sorry to bother *you*."" Like this man didn't just word vomit his entire manifesto into my poor addled ears, aging me by 20 years and robbing what little hard drive space is left in my ADHD rife brain.

Yeah, that fucker can get a no every day of the week as far as I'm concerned. His rapscallion kids wearing discount clothes can get a no, and his scoundrel of a mother for raising such an impolite cretin can get a no as well. That man ignited a passion for handing out ""NO""s indiscriminately, so I really should be thanking him."

No issue passing an alcohol test because it flushes from the system faster though. More damage to the system, impairs judgment long term when abused, but what do I know?"

Still good, but so is everyone else."

wholesomememes,ffupk1a,t1_ffuisay,1580246850.0,"Small tidbit volunteering at a distress line,

*people value listening more than any program can offer*. I think it can be beneficial to offer life experience, but only after they've adequately explained themselves. What's important to you is different for them, and they could be withholding details making problems seem less severe.

""I'm failing my classes."" on the surface sounds like it can be helped with ""you can stop by your professor's office during certain hours."", or ""make sure you have restful sleep and a good diet"" but they could be failing because they struggle to connect with peers and use their time to cope instead of studying. How you'd figure that out is by asking the important questions and being genuinely interested by their situation."

AskReddit,fe4ieaa,t3_enlq40,1578859612.0,"Asking for money and then being a prick like ""You won't even spare a dollar?""

When they're arrogant with service workers.

Treating minorities like they're stupid.

Anyone who walks with their chest puffed out like they want to fight.

Insulting someone, then saying ""no offense"" or ""just kidding"". Bonus points if they say ""yeah, I'm an asshole/bully""

Literally anyone distracted while on the road. Drivers in general.

Conversation starters who are too stupid to understand social cues, then get mad when it finally clicks that maybe I don't give a fuck about their opinion on why leftists are morons.

Their lives are good ie. good genetics, eats clean, has friends, bf/gf, good job, then tries to shit on those with less as ""lazy"" or ""unintelligent"" thus undeserving of human decency. Either that, or tries to relate like ""I get sad too"". Obviously different than someone who has zero support.

Power trippers. Namely police, owners/managers, Karens. Do you know who can pound your head into disability or choke you out cold? Martial artists. Most are chill pot smokers, or just chill in general. Weird, huh?

I'm sure there's more, but that's just off the top of my head. Living in the city offers better opportunity, but no one said the opportunity had to always be *good*.
