Also...sorry, but I gotta add this...

#For Future Reference and For Anyone Else Reading This: 

In at least 41 States (USA), you can easily purchase Naloxone/Narcan at pharmacies, often without a prescription. Your insurance plan will usually cover most (or all) of the cost. If you don't have insurance and/or want to pay out-of-pocket, a 2-dose kit of the generic Naloxone is usually around $20. The pricier brand-name Narcan comes in kits that can run $100-$130. Whether generic or brand-name, this Naloxone comes as a nasal spray. If it's administered in time, it can effectively and rapidly reverse/eliminate the effects of an opiate overdose.

So insurance could cover this, but even without insurance, I think that spending $20 for a medication that could easily save your life or the life of a loved one *is absolutely worth it.* I bought one of the $20 kits for my mom, who takes Percocet and has overdosed in the past. Last time she OD'd, I found her unresponsive, not breathing, and lacking a pulse; I had to perform CPR until paramedics arrived. Trust me...the Naloxone would have been a wildly preferable alternative.

If you're taking large amounts of opiates, if your friends or family are taking opiates, *please* try to get some Naloxone -- and read the instructions that come with it so that you can be prepared. Tell any friends/family who might witness you OD'ing that you have it and tell them where it is. 

It could mean the difference between life and death, and at least you'd have *some* means of helping yourself or helping a friend, even if nobody wants to call 911. Ideally, you *should* administer the Naloxone and then *also* call for an ambulance or get to a hospital, because it's still important to get medical attention and to ensure that the pulse/respiration don't drop again. 

But you could *at least* use the Naloxone. Even if you do plan to call 911, you should still administer the Naloxone while you wait for paramedics. 

Sorry for the rant. A lot of people seem surprised to learn that Naloxone can be bought OTC, which is crazy because people are just overdosing on opiates left and right. This shit could easily save someone's life."

I know that legal representation can be provided once I've been formally arrested, but what if I *haven't* been arrested or charged with a crime?

I've had only two formal interactions with police, and both experiences were pretty unpleasant. I was a victim reporting a violent crime in both cases -- first when I was 12, in the United States, and again in Spain at the age of 23. But in both cases, I was openly belittled. The cop in Spain even  repeatedly and explicitly blamed me for being victimized. So I know that they aren't really ""on my side."" I know enough to be guarded around cops. Sadly, I'm now afraid to even report a crime.

If I'm ever seriously questioned, especially as a potential suspect, I know to seek legal representation. But how am I supposed to get a lawyer? I barely even have enough money to *feed* myself, ffs.

It's actually considered dangerously unlucky for these women to touch anyone or anything. Women who have recently given birth undergo a similar (but longer) isolation period. It's a dying practice these days, but it does still exist among certain groups.

Similar rituals and beliefs have historically existed in other cultures throughout the world, especially in cultures that religiously emphasize a ""clean"" vs. ""unclean"" (and ""good"" vs. ""bad"") dichotomy.

Those distinctly unrelated bumps were almost entirely outside of the burned area. The one tiny red/inflamed dot further down was still intact, as well.

We (by which I mean my mother and I) isolated those blemishes from the main point of impact and determined that there was no new broken skin by meticulously examining the injury afterward (as we naturally wanted to be safe and assumed that a clear, rational explanation would thereby present itself). But you're right, of course, that it's still worth double-checking just to be safe.

The injury itself actually felt, looked, and healed much more like a sunburn.

I'll have to check my text messages to see if I discussed the healing phases with my friend (I'm just going to call her Alex from here on out) and hope that one of us has a photo.

AskReddit,f84ci15,t1_f83jqw7,1574241114.0,"When I was about 20, I seriously spent *months* trying  to convince my parents to let me put up a nice work shed in their backyard. I was willing to pay for it, build it, and maintain it, and then they'd be more than welcome to use it for stuff like reading, hanging out, and (well-organized) storage. But only if I could use it as an art studio, study, and living quarters. 

The shed I wanted even had a loft up near the ceiling with a sliding ladder and a workbench. I also drew up plans to install a heating/humidifying system for my lizard. I was absolutely willing to live in that shed. 

I wouldn't be spending *all* of  my time there, though -- I travel frequently for my career, but I'd need a place to crash between dig seasons. The shed seemed like a viable solution to the question of housing whenever I was stateside. Why waste money on a house that I'd only be living in for a third of the year, or go through the trouble of finding a new apartment to lease every few months...when I could just come home to a nice cozy shed?

I think my folks briefly considered it just for the sake of getting my art supplies out of their garage...but then they probably pictured me at about 40, living with a giant pet lizard and a bunch of cats in a shed behind the house. I told them that I was happy to spend my later years as ""that weird  witchy lady who lives in the shed"" but idk, for some reason they ultimately backed out."
travel,f82qsra,t3_dybww6,1574196436.0,"Seattle! Portland is fun, too. Can't really comment on the other cities, as I've never really visited them. But I'm from WA and lived in Seattle for years. Cost of living can be steep in certain areas, but you can find more affordable neighborhoods in the city and just outside of it. There are several affordable cities around Seattle you could consider if you don't mind a short commute.


- Seattle has plenty of fantastic, live music venues. I've been to live bluegrass, indie, and folk shows. I know that you could find Blues and other Americana shows, too.


- And a definite yes on the food/drink culture. Great restaurants, especially seafood, but also tons of international restaurants and traditional American foods. And, of course, bar foods, food trucks, and food festivals. Also tons of craft breweries (hipsters actually make pretty good beer) and some really neat bars.


-  Finding a coffee job in WA is pretty easy imo, especially in Seattle. Starbucks is literally everywhere, but there are *many* other cafes that do very well. Minimum wage in Seattle is $12/hr, too.I did the barista thing for a while in college and there were always job openings at the cafe. Many folks who take these jobs are college students who plan to quit within a couple months (for various reasons) which results in some pretty frequent vacancies. I never bartended, personally, but from what I've seen, the turnaround isn't as fast for those jobs. Bartenders seem less eager to quit because the tips are just too good (and their training/certification takes longer). I'm sure there are openings, though. Just not as many.


- In my experience, Seattleites are generally quite friendly. It is a big city, and so it's still easy to feel overlooked, but most people are pretty welcoming and open. Pretty easy to make friends here.  


If you do visit Seattle, have fun! 

Hope I could help. Feel free to contact me if you need any other info! And good luck with your trip, wherever you go :)"

When I finally made it home and inspected my bag, it was all wrapped up in cellophane and duct tape because the baggage handlers had wanted to stop the beer from dripping off of it, and it absolutely *reeked* of beer. Some of the cans (and the 3-4 bottles I'd also packed) had survived, but most of the cans had just exploded mid-flight.

Kinda surreal), a Bedouin camp (I think we stayed at a different camp, tho), and, of course, Petra. 

It's an amazing, beautiful country, and we really loved it. Especially Petra, as my friend and I are both archaeologists, and the Bedouin camp. We got to the camp in the dead of winter, so the Negev was utterly freezing at night (well below 20°F) but by sheer, dumb luck, we happened to be there during the Perseid Meteor Shower. My friend was too tired and too cold to go watch the spectacle with me, but it was so beautiful and the sky was completely clear and covered in stars. I stayed up all night watching the stars/meteors, just bundled up in blankets and listening to hyenas in the distance. One of my best memories ever.

I may try to scrounge up some of my old photos of that trip just to share.

Few quick questions: 

- Which Bedouin camp did you guys stay at? Can't remember if you mentioned it.

- And what sites/neighborhoods/restaurants would you recommend in Amman?

We stood dumbfounded for a moment before my mom finally seemed to understand what was happening, climbed into the thicket (cutting herself in the process) and managed to coax the woman back out.  She tried to calm her down, urging a passerby to call 911. We sat with her and my mom helped clean the blood off of the lady's face while we waited for help to arrive.

My mom had recognized the gown, the woman's apparent mental illness, and our proximity to Western State Mental Hospital* (a notorious Voluntary/Involuntary Psychiatric Institution, with most patients falling into the second category and their hospitalization was court-ordered), which was just across the street. It was dismally common for patients to wander away from the campus.

Some of these are far more likely than others, but to cast a wide net, let's include:


- **NASA**: Recruitment of candidates under the guise of astronaut training, then abduction of the most physically fit, mentally fit, and adaptable candidates to abduct and send to this ""special training program"" -- as potential supersoldier subjects and guinea pigs

 - **The Department of Education**: early detection of valuable skills among children and teens, abduction of said assets under the guise of sending them to a fully funded, prestigious boarding school (a la Firefly/Serenity), where they are forced to undergo physical and chemical enhancements before testing brainwashing techniques to make them compliant enough to blindly follow orders

- **Department of the Interior**: Abduction of vagrants, possibly without DOI knowledge that they're to be used as guinea pigs during early stages of the super soldier procedures and treatments

- **DHS** and **ICE**: abduction of refugees/asylum seekers/illegal immigrants to also be used as guinea pigs

- **DOJ**: more free guinea pigs

- **VA**: abduction of healthy, high-performing, physically and mentally fit candidates to send as supersoldier candidates and guinea pigs; and disabled/mentally ill subjects for guinea pigs

Etc., etc...you get the idea. Any department dealing with vulnerable populations has a copious supply of guinea pigs. Departments dealing with highly skilled, combat ready, military experienced, physically/mentally fit populations can supply supersoldier candidates. Then CIA/NSA basically have their pick of abductees for whatever role they deem appropriate. Keep in mind that most of these departments would not be informed about the true reasons for abductions, and would be misled to believe that the abductions are really just social service programs intended to improve the lives of those bring abducted.


DOD heads the project itself but also has access to its own candidates from various branches of the military, and is ultimately complicit in every abduction.


If DOD and the powers-that-be really wanted this (and I'm sure they would if it was feasible) and was willing to withhold funds or seek out the more persuadable/amoral employees, then it's not beyond the realm of imagination that any department with the aforementioned accesses to subjects could agree to comply."

I really have tried to exhaust all the explanations that I can think of,  and I never said that I thought it was a demon or a ghost. I certainly never said that I was ""sure"" about anything. I pretty explicitly said that I have no idea. 

I was actually hoping that people might put forth some other explanations when I shared this, and several people have done so. I'm open to anything right now, including the more rational alternatives. 

>Why did you give up on seeing the northern lights? 

As stated, we had been driving for several hours and hadn't caught a glimpse of the lights. There wasn't much point in continuing to look for them (which was admittedly a bummer).

>What's the name of this cemetery so others can go check it out for themselves?

I'd really rather not give away my location, tbh.

>Why jump to boring ghosts and demons instead of considering something much more awesome: the local military/mad scientist is trying out their invisibility suit, a very very tiny meteor collided with your back and left the burn, or you were shot by some sort of stun gun by someone neither your friend nor you saw. 

 I actually thought about joking that it could've been a meteorite. I'm not ruling out any of those possibilities, though. *Especially* the invisi-suit.

>Why did the entity appear to follow you home, from what you said in feeling like you were being watched, yet not physically assault you again? 

I think the dreams and the general feeling of unease were both just the result of feeling rattled. I brought them up only to illustrate how much this incident has been bothering me -- that it has actually resurrected nightmares which I hadn't had in years. I just thought that it was an interesting detail, and I apologize for being unclear about what I was trying to express with that part.

>What makes you worth dream stalking let alone worth fighting through whatever random barrier keeps demons and ghosts from normally interacting with the world to physically assault? Like, what is the point?

I have no idea how I'm supposed to answer this. For all I know, whatever hit me in the cemetery might have been going for my friend. Maybe it was going for the *car* and I just got in the way. I think the dreams, specifically, are more psychosomatic than anything else.

She noticed that we were within 20-30 minutes of her hometown. We were just heading in that general direction.

>My father is a genealogy freak, he went to different countries to collect data about our ancestors and there’s no point in his research involving a cemetery. Not that seeing a grave couldn’t help, but genealogy is mostly about reading looking for information in old registers and in talking to (living) people to get more info.

She had been researching her genealogy, which got her interested in visiting the graves. I never said that visiting the graves was part of the research, just that she had been interested in her lineage.

> As for taking night photos of graves, well hopefully she doesn’t expect to do much with it because the quality won’t be good.

She has a flash function. The photos weren't great, but they didn't need to be.

> “I have done several cemetery seriation projects as an archeologist” - that’s VERY convenient...

That was just a tangential detail. Many archaeology students are assigned cemetery seriation projects. And it's not really ""convenient,"" given that that detail didn't really affect the rest of the experience at all, I mostly just wanted to take the opportunity to announce my profession, because it makes me feel cool (jk).

> “Still, I just chalked it up to casual anxiety and tried not to dwell on it. One of the problems with having an anxiety disorder is that it's sometimes hard to tell when your nervousness is justified. “ - first you talk about casual anxiety, then you say you have a disorder.
