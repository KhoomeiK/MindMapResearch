tarot,fno5fe1,t3_g2t21h,1587112747.0,Thank you for your reply Iâ€™m feeling better after reading peopleâ€™s comments :)
tarot,fno5ap1,t3_g2t21h,1587112609.0,Thank you for your reply I think you may right. Perhaps my doubts in the back of my head were clouding my own judgement. Iâ€™m currently feeling better:)
mentalhealth,fno54pa,t3_g2tf3m,1587112432.0,Thank you for your reply I appreciate it. Iâ€™m feeling better ðŸ˜Š
mentalhealth,fnnj14l,t1_fnnia2i,1587093507.0,Youâ€™re probably right. I feel a little silly now I just wasnâ€™t sure what to expect but thanks for your insight I really needed it to get my mind straight.
mentalhealth,fnnhe6u,t1_fnngahe,1587092421.0,Unfortunately I didnâ€™t know what the cards were but to give some context I asked about a career I wanted to pursue and if I should go for it in the future. She said that No that I shouldnâ€™t because I will have a hard time with the unexpected change and to be patient and wait because it will prepare me to make any possible changes that I want to. I might have interpreted it  wrong because my plan was to stay with my current situation for a little while until I felt financially ready to pursue this career. I think I just panicked when I saw the word no and blurred everything else.
mentalhealth,fmhk1xc,t3_fv5y5j,1586083417.0,I had horrible social anxiety as a kid. I wouldnâ€™t do anything so I didnâ€™t have behavioral issues. My earliest memories were me being anxious a lot. My parents would raise us and teach us to be respectful. I was way above in my maturity level than others kids my own age. It was blessing in a way because I would catch when my friendships were toxic. The bad thing was I had a hard time knowing my self worth and also how to stand up for myself.
Kawaii,fm6u6zb,t1_fm6tmqe,1585803361.0,Youâ€™re welcome :)
Kawaii,fm6tj61,t3_fte6th,1585802819.0,Love it! ðŸ’•
Kawaii,flzti7o,t3_fs2xf5,1585633089.0,"In my city as someone who dresses in kawaii fashion I havenâ€™t met anyone that dresses in this fashion. I do get a lot of compliments when Iâ€™m out. Once when I went to Albuquerque New Mexico there was a girl who dressed in kawaii fashion that worked at the mall. It was at a hot topic store and she complimented what I was buying. You kind of have to find people who dress kawaii. Sometimes depending on the city theyâ€™ll be J-fashion and kawaii online communities that may sometimes have meet ups, but where I live there is no such thing."
sleep,flw46cj,t1_flvnj4n,1585539193.0,I have not. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s narcolepsy. I do not know much about IH
LetsNotMeet,flup9zf,t3_fra3a8,1585507206.0,Iâ€™m glad that creeper finally backed off. I never had an experience like that but thank goodness youâ€™re safe.

mentalhealth,flg2zaj,t1_flg2lqu,1585128371.0,"Thank you for replying. I think just needed to let it out. Iâ€™m usually very busy so it donâ€™t stop often think about these things. Iâ€™m starting to feel a little better now, thanks."
mentalhealth,fkdk3j7,t1_fkdk1bn,1584081892.0,Thank you! Iâ€™ll try that out.
SkincareAddiction,fitpjcd,t1_fitbn6s,1582726420.0,Okay thanks I look into that!
SkincareAddiction,fitpdbn,t1_fit4bhd,1582726305.0,What is bio-oil?
GERD,fhzltca,t1_fhzlmqo,1582003195.0,What would I even ask my doctor for if he feels I donâ€™t need surgery?
GERD,fhzlkzh,t1_fhzldjz,1582002993.0,I have stopped taking medications. Also I donâ€™t know what treatment I would get since I donâ€™t have a hernia. I just donâ€™t want to get a pointless surgery
GERD,fhzlbzq,t1_fhzl1gr,1582002776.0,Perhaps but my Gastroenterologist doesnâ€™t want me to have surgery because Iâ€™m young and a surgery will give me more complications. Also my parents think Iâ€™m being paranoid and wasting money having all these tests done. I have bad health anxiety so I question myself if more tests are necessary.
GERD,fhzkyk8,t1_fhzksi7,1582002458.0,Yes back when I had that constant throat clearing. They found absolutely nothing internally but they didnâ€™t comment on my red area I mentioned. Iâ€™m assuming they saw it since itâ€™s like the entrance way per say but idk at this point.
GERD,fhzkplt,t1_fhzkln6,1582002245.0,Ah ok. My dad had that surgery I believe. I think thatâ€™s why itâ€™s preventing you from healing because I donâ€™t have a hernia myself.
GERD,fhzkk5l,t1_fhxxql0,1582002115.0,What will happen during your surgery?
GERD,fhzkbcq,t1_fhxxql0,1582001913.0,Have you tried staying on the GERD diet during that time?

studytips,fhbt50r,t1_fhbnv9d,1581449330.0,Thanks for your reply. I will try it out :)
Anxietyhelp,fgqlux8,t1_fgqk05a,1581026680.0,Okay thanks! I will look more into that
Anxietyhelp,fgqi421,t1_fgqgsi5,1581024616.0,Thanks for your advice. I did bring up counseling and he seems like heâ€™s considering it. Though medication is not possible right now for him because his family does not have doctors insurance.
Anxietyhelp,fgkw4kj,t3_ez1vhf,1580874993.0,"Thank you! Iâ€™m doing a lot better now. The GERD was most likely caused by the stress and the fact that I was overeating because I was trying to cope with the stress by eating. I donâ€™t have those issues anymore. I did talk to a counselor during that time though, itâ€™s just difficult with my schedule to try and fit in my current schedule."
Anxietyhelp,fgku5aa,t3_ez1vhf,1580873664.0,Physical health. I had GERD for a year and it was awful. I was negligent of my overall health because I was way too stressed one semester and it resulted in horrible GERD. Ever since that experience Iâ€™ve been way more anxious about my health. I worry about little issues that I notice about my body now.
Anxietyhelp,fgks9xd,t1_fgkqo63,1580872481.0,"I could go to the counselor, but itâ€™s hard to fit in my schedule for college. Also I managed to talk to my mom about what I wanted to talk about and nothing bad happened. I just canâ€™t always predict how she will react sometimes. I just dive into sometimes hoping it goes well."
