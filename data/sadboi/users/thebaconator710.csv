electronicmusic,fqik7mu,t1_fqihdml,1589397097.0,"My point is that it making good music has way less to do with having nice gear than you're implying. I'm not trying to brag about having a nice computer, because comparatively speaking its not so nice anymore. I spent my entire savings on building a computer that would last. A big part of it is buying the right equipment. Sure you can by a cheap laptop for $200 every 3 years but in the long run you're spending way more than just investing in something that will last. Either way, the guy with the cheap laptop has just as much potential to make quality music as the guy with the custom pc, you're falling into the misconception that making music has more to do with equipment than personal ability, which is absolutely not true. There are plenty of super talented bass music producers who only use a laptop and stock ableton plugins and then there's producers who spent 5 grand on 800 plugins just to make sub par dubstep."
electronicmusic,fqibz4t,t1_fqi8822,1589393964.0,"Yes, 100%. My DAW, even with like 300 plug-ins only uses like 50% of my CPU's processing power. I can get as ambitious as I want without any issues. Keep in mind I've been using the same computer for 10 years and the only upgrade I've added is RAM.

 So again, yes, computer advances has a lot less of an effect on music production than you think. Its more about the Software we use that is changing and opening new doors. But again, because clearly you have no idea what you're talking about, most computers that came out in the last 10-15 years can push any DAW to the limits.  I doubt there's anything being made that couldn't have been made 10 years ago, given that the plug-ins used aren't new."

If you say, ""Bill Gates is corrupt and 5g is causing coronavirus"", even if one is true and one isn't most people don't want to take the time to figure out which is BS so they just write both off as false. And then you have people like the comment above you that just want to believe that the world is exactly like they think it is, that if they don't know about it doesnt exist.

SocietyGives,fqi87zl,t1_fqgy7h2,1589392189.0,"Its not about thinking you know more than other people. Its about opening your mind up to the possibility, because the truth is we are all stupid and don't know jack shit. 

You and I both have no idea whats going on out there, and the only thing we can do is take the evidence given to us and speculate based off that. Its just as narcissist to tell people that they are wrong and stupid, you're no better than the anti 5g people out there. I'm not saying Bill Gates is evil, but given his wealth and power he certainly could be corrupt.

 The difference is, im saying its possible but we don't know because we don't know the guy. You're saying anyone who believes is stupid, narcissistic and wrong. Do you see my point here?"
conspiracy,fqgf5x1,t1_fqgbdy3,1589344698.0,"That mostly comes from the teacher themselves. Which depends *a lot* on where you live. I've had some amazing teachers that taught me to think in a critical and objective way and made sure we learned the right content. However, I grew up in a southern state with one of the lowest ranking education systems in the country, and a lot of that comes from the downright pathetic teacher pay. Seriously though, teachers there make about the same as an assistant manager at Wendy's. Its sad. A few are passionate about teaching and the rest just don't give a shit because they're getting paid to babysit and thats it."

Hearing that changed my perspective a bit, I now realize that some people are just born as sheep and at least think they are unable to do anything about, so they stick with the herd for protection. Independent thought is a learned personality trait that some people are able to develop and others are not.

 The issue happens when a system is created to prey on these people and use them against their own best interests."

What it seems like is that there are more and more asinine theories being purposefully put in front of these people to discredit and fog up the credible ones.
