selfharm,fqzoc88,t1_fqznua3,1589771662.0,"thanks, you too!"
selfharm,fqzn6v3,t1_fqzlwnj,1589770920.0,its more i hit it against things rather than knocking at it out of anger or something. or like sometimes ill just give it a good punch. for some reason nothing else does itbfor me but i recognize i really shouldn't be doing it also so idk
selfharm,fqzlmhj,t1_fqzlcqo,1589769938.0,"yeah i hear a lot of people did it when they were kids, i guess im just a slightly bigger kid"
selfharm,fqy2wki,t3_gl9yeq,1589741716.0,"ive never cut but ive been recently slamming/punching my head a lot, so its nice to hear something that isnt about cutting

im honestly considering starting to cut instead bc im kinda scared of brain damage, but nothing else i do is as satisfying"
mentalillness,fqxx0un,t1_fqqnji9,1589739146.0,"i do online video therapy, which works really well for me since I'm pretty bad at talking to people in person. Also with that it opens up whats available to you a lot"
mentalillness,fqxwjw1,t3_glaru2,1589738946.0,"maybe rather than trying to let it go and get rid of it, its more of a journey of recognizing that it happened, you can't change it, and all you can do is accept that and move on. 

feel free to ignore my advice tho, i have no idea what I'm talking about most of the time"
mentalillness,fqxw1c0,t3_gl3vd3,1589738728.0,i REALLY want one of those
mentalillness,fqsitl3,t1_fqs6an4,1589608467.0,"honeslty im pretty sure i just want attention, but like i want someone to notice rather than like reaching out ig, idrk why

its a silly and pointless cycle"
mentalillness,fqrnc4b,t3_gkguw7,1589587856.0,"i have a similar thing but a bit different, i guess i enjoy the things that i enjoy but I'm always thinking that whenever I'm enjoying myself i just know its because I'm distracting myself from real shitty things that i cant change, and in reality theyre all still there. so i feel like there isnt much point, if that makes sense."
mentalillness,fqqkpc3,t3_gka39u,1589567212.0,"honestly, finding the right therapist under your own terms can be really really helpful. its kind of difficult to actually go and do but its worth it. you also don't have to be prescribed anything if thats not your goal, sometimes just having someone work through whatever you're going through is all you need. having thought bundled up for a long time limits your perspective and causes thought ""spiraling"", but a new perspective and genuine/personal encouragement can go a long way"
mentalillness,fqqdyue,t1_fqqaprd,1589563871.0,ice and rubber band were both pretty alright. i also tried the running my head under ice water. it helped at first but the urge to go back to punching didnt really go away.  at the very least i didnt do it tho lol so ig it worked
mentalillness,fqoopua,t1_fqntl2p,1589520493.0,"i actually used to do this i forgot about it

also tbt the salt and ice challenge"
mentalillness,fqn23dm,t1_fqmj1xs,1589487374.0,"i was asking for alternative ways to self harm instead of different ways to cope, but i appreciate it"
mentalillness,fqmi56p,t3_gjcgh7,1589477835.0,yeah!
mentalillness,fqmhp3w,t3_gjptu4,1589477624.0,"i sometimes bang it and i sometimes punch my head, its not necessarily when i want to forget something tho, i just kinda do it sometimes"
mentalillness,fpw7hvm,t3_gft1cj,1588958588.0,"saaaaaaame omg

every single moment of my life has to be productive in some way or i go crazy. and half the time i cant even get anything done but god forbid i give myself time to relax. even sleeping drives me nuts because of how much time it takes. i feel like a ticking time bomb"
mentalillness,fpuxpyc,t3_gf9a63,1588927432.0,whenever i hear anyone even walking outside of my door i get insanely anxious for a few seconds to the point i cant breathe and then i remember that im just being an idiot. havent felt anger or anything but ig nobodys actually coming up to my door so its probably a little different. im curious if its actually kind of a common thing bc i dont know anyone else whos like this
mentalillness,fpuxh3p,t3_gfoqhj,1588927175.0,"i feel like it might be a completely different thing, but maybe not, but i always feel like whenever i have really strong emotions i feel like I'm faking it and my suffering doesn't actually count. I'm just overreacting over stuff so that i can convince myself I'm damaged to make my personal narrative more interesting."
mentalillness,fpux7tb,t1_fpux2t7,1588926901.0,i dont think i know what that is
mentalillness,fpux64j,t3_gfdya6,1588926851.0,I'm trans and 19 and I'm dealing with pretty bad MPB. i feel ya.
mentalillness,fpuwzue,t3_gfm971,1588926668.0,I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY HOLY SHIT IDK WHY

mentalillness,fp0mvml,t1_fox30c4,1588212489.0,"its usually something youre born with, but can be developed from trauma i believe"
mentalillness,fowmyf6,t1_fow23zk,1588122976.0,"i don't really see how that would solve anything though, even if i miraculously was able to communicate my situation"
