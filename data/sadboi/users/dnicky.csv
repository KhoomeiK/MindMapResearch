The good news is you can actually address the trauma. It doesn't have to be a complete mystery and inconvenience. That's what I'm doing now.

The fact that people in mental health professions (especially therapists!) can be so quick to demonize people with the disorder is honestly baffling to me and really sad. It's just a complete failure of empathy as well as a pretty striking self-centeredness, in my opinion. 

I feel really bad (as well as frustrated /angry) because people get deeply affected by stigma and it contributes to negative outcomes. Of course you can do anything if you suffer from BPD! Jfc you're a person with intelligence and creativity and skills.

I might check out that book - I'm a big reader, so I'm always open to a new recommendations. I'm also interested in stuff like consciousness, and really any sort of existential topic.

I had been with my therapist for nearly a year before the attempt, and kept on with her afterwards (I'm still with her today, and have had a couple more attempts since then - I'm now in a position where I feel more and more comfortable discussing suicide with her). At the time, it was my first attempt and my one and only time being hospitalized -- upon being discharged I felt so awful and guilty about what I had done, that having someone who already knew what was going on was a big relief. My only fear was that she would not want to continue with me because I was a liability. But we discussed this briefly, and she made it clear she was happy to work with me."
