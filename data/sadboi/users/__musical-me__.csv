Anecdotally, I find life to be much more bearable on Zoloft even with the sexual side effects. I actually want to do things now and feel very content with life. I am more horny now but it’s just more difficult to ejaculate which is why I skip a dose on days I anticipate having sex.

The only problem with Welbutrin is to avoid drinking caffeinated beverages or any other med (like certain nasal sprays) that also stimulate your nervous system because ignoring to do so is a recipe for disaster.

OpiateRecovery,fhwig9h,t1_fhwhvuk,1581916828.0,"It's not the same as adderall. I had bad side effects from adderall so I won't take it. The Welbutrin, for me, just removed that low energy feeling that I had, that's why I say it was kinda like adderall. It does other things too that typical anti-depressants do only its sort of like a stimulant anti-depressant where something like paxil is a nervous system depressor and it never worked for me over a 3 year period. Welbutrin can be used to help smokers quit smoking (that's an on label use), I'm not sure how as I've never been a smoker, but an addiction is an addiction. It does increase dopamine levels."
OpiateRecovery,fhwfnbe,t1_fhwdwhf,1581914446.0,"I can't speak on the subs. All I know is that I had a very negative energy weighing me down every day. I didn't want to do a damn thing. Wellbutrin is a  serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and is used to treat depression and a few other things. It has a bit of a kick to it. It's not a ""high"" kick, but it's a bit like ""baby"" adderall in terms of how I feel."
