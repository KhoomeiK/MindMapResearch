If Raava’s connection to them is lost that means their spirits are resting instead of being carried inside of Korra. And probably the reset needed to happen since there is 10,000 years worth of souls bundled together... which definitely muddies the connection to Raava for each new Avatar. It makes sense that the opposite of Fire and a female instead of a male be the first of a new dynasty of Avatars."

askscience,fr04v6d,t1_fqz3j0f,1589783810.0,"The most terrifying experience I ever had was flying into Missoula MT from Salt Lake. I am a passenger but I did fly this particular route often because I have family all over and I lived near Missoula so I’m used to landing and taking off. The turbulence is always poor near Missoula due to the mountains and typically smooth the closer you get to Salt Lake but weather can change that... etc.,

We were circling Missoula to get clearance to land, I notice this because we kept circling for a while. It’s partly cloudy and it’s winter. We must’ve gotten clearance to land because we started to descend and the fasten seatbelt sign came on. The pilots were silent and so were the flight attendants. The attendants were still walking around the cabin and telling people to lock trays etc., things got progressively bumpier and bumpier. The pilots told the attendants to strap in. I am not worried at this point. The plane started dropping and we were bouncing on our seats a lot, moments of literal near-weightlessness I had never experienced before. The lights in the plane went out and emergency lighting came on. People were gasping and crying and the couple next to me were holding hands and crying. Children were screaming and a baby was crying. A flight attendants eyes were closed (I was near where one was strapped in) and I was crying too. The plane was being thrown around like a rag doll. Suddenly an engine died. I noticed this because in the middle of many turbulent bounces and terrifying and jarring shaking a huge smack sort of happened... the engine made a very terrifying sort of “boofff put put put” noise and it then stopped making any normal engine noise and we could tell because compared to the port side (or left-hand side) we could hear only silence from the starboard side (or the right-hand side) and we could all feel it if that makes sense. 

People cried more and the shaking was so terrifying my arm was itchy from the vibrations. We all thought we were going to die. The flight attendant nearest me was gripping onto her straps and her eyes were just closed. The bumping and dropping in altitude continued and the shaking was so scary I was getting nauseous as well.. and the person (one of the couple) immediately next to me held my hand too and we all cried together (the whole plane). I was prepared to literally die at this point. That we were going to crash somewhere in the bitterroot or in town or into a mountain. This went on for such a long time but also I could’ve perceived time wrong because of the terror. The lights were still off in the cabin and the emergency lighting was flickering on and off. Some other people noticed the engine was off and another layer of panic set in people were whispering and pleading with God.

I am not religious or even Christian... but I asked God not to let us die like this... and I was crying and gasping for air (partly from crying and partly because dropping out of the sky and bouncing was literally taking my breath away) and the couple next to me were crying, and holding hands so tightly their palms were white, and my hands were clammy and swollen... trying to hold onto the persons hand felt like the only power I had at this point... the image of the couple holding hands over the seat is seared into my memory forever.

Suddenly everything stopped and we were landing. We all were leaning so far forward into the seats and touched down harder than I ever felt a landing before. The engine never came back on, it was silent and dead the whole landing. I didn’t feel the wheels come down at all because that’s how loud and how violent the turbulence was. We clapped so hard and loud and some people cheered. We all hugged or shook hands with the pilots (literally). And the flight attendants faces were red and we could tell some had been crying too. 

I run off the plane. I never found out what happened to the engine, what caused the turbulence and I didn’t ask. My face was swollen and my family picking me up at the airport was shaken to see so many people with work faces and asked me what happened. Lots of people talked about it at the baggage claim and I heard talked of a bird strike but this wasn’t confirmed. 

Most terrifying experience and I haven’t flown since."

CarnivalRow,fqoloba,t3_gjguu8,1589518205.0,"There are a lot of allusions to real world racism, homophobia and transphobia. An American viewpoint might be black people and white people. This is pretty on the nose between Imogen and Agreas, however the pix are a lot more like Jewish people. Pucks stand out against a crowd with their horns and hooves. Pix are not immediately different from the the humans (especially if you hide your wings or if they’re shorn) and there is envy of their wings (you can say this envy might be similar to Christians vs Jews since the jewish people are the chosen people). 

Imagine being a good Christian woman during WW2 in Germany and you fall in love with a handsome copper. You are a widow and you love this person and expect he will make an honest woman out of you. Finally you find out that the man you’ve fallen in love with is Jewish (at least half Jewish and at this time having any Jewish ancestry was a crime in Germany). You won’t go to the police but you are distraught and you feel like if you try to conceal his identity at all and assume that the cops already know who he is.... than you know why she told another cop. She only suspect he will get a year for passing. (Passing is also an allusion to Trans folk passing as Cis) when she is ruminating about what she’s done she realizes that all the people who know his secret are dead except for her and since she still loves him, she decides to go to the police and pretend like it was a joke... this would be like going to the Nazi’s and saying “I’m sorry my lover and I had a quarrel there isn’t any proof of him being a Jew”

Believe it or not during WW2 a lot of people were put in concentration camps because someone turned them in for being Jewish or LGBT but in reality they were not. These people were shot, gassed, tortured, or forced to work in labor camps, dying of dehydration, starvation, infection, etc., 

The humans in the Burge believe themselves to be far superior to all other beings simply because their technology is more advanced. Despite the other races being far older and more attuned to nature and peaceful. This is similar to colonizing countries like England, France, Spain and Italy that all went around the world and put flags into the ground or foreign land going “we own this shit now and we are better than you because we say so” and are met with either little resistance due to the peacefulness of the inhabitants or because the colonizers more or less ambushed them with superior weaponry. These people were enslaved or concentrated and the lands colonized. In many cases they were given reservations to live on while their lands were stolen and shrunken away while the people were impoverished and their attempts for reconciliation were met with genocidal acts. This same thing happens in the world of Carnival Row. The name Carnival comes from the root work carne or meat. Carnivals in our own world are places where “freaks of nature” perform for entertainment. This is how the humans see the other races, freaks of nature or basically animals. This is also how Nazis and evening modern-day racist/conservative white supremacists view immigrants, people of color, LGBT, indigenous people, or mixed groups. 

In conclusion, her final act of kindness is remorse for turning him in. Of course she probably loved him, and felt deceived when he told her who he really was. Indeed he deceived her but he did so to protect himself and in reality it didn’t change a thing about who he was to begin with except now we know who his mother is. 

My partner and I were debating on wether any of his human children would be born with wings or strange ears. And we also thought about if his fairy children would have strong enough wings to fly or if their bones would be too dense. It’s unfortunate his wings were shorn but based on the description given to him by Afissa, more than likely his wings would have grown to be too small or were malformed. Even if his wings grew to be big enough, it is unlikely he could ever take flight due to the density of his bones as it is repeatedly told to us that the fairy have hollow bones and are slight of frame, neither of which Philo is. His mother wanted a better life for him, and it doesn’t seem like he would have had a poor one as full fledged fairy necessarily, but it’s obvious that as a half breed he would be bombarded with “whose your daddy?” And “why can’t you fly?” Among others. It may be sad his wings were shorn but it did him a service in the long run. He had a very successful military career, and was a good cop. Also he is destined to be a greater man than his father the human Burge Chancellor. Season 2 don’t fail us now!!!"
CarnivalRow,fqkt6ei,t1_fqb8zbn,1589435578.0,"SPOILERS: 

I like the show and tbh yea there isn’t much reason for the characters to be fantastical in the beginning or in some other specific cases... except that it does draw you in and it shows you the lengths people go to to ostracize, concentrate, or indenture other human beings and basically treat them like they are altogether another species or animals and it’s not right. There are a lot of subjects being touched on. The fact that some fae are “passing” as humans is similar to how some trans folk or racially ambiguous people can pass as cis or white. 

Spoiler warning: There is also imprisoned soldiers these could be symbolic of how black men went to war for USA in Civil War, WW1, WW2, Vietnam, etc,. And still came home to find racism and Jim Crow. Later on they show us how a person who has been passing this whole time is quickly turned on by his friends coworkers as soon as they find out that he isn’t what he appears to be...  that our prejudices blind us from treating even people we care about fairly. 

There is a subplot revolving religion and it could be easily done without the pucks being pucks. But the main plot sort of requires magic and fairy stuff except that the person performing the magic is a human. There is more flying later on but it definitely gets underused in my opinion, but it’s cool that the centaurs can be carriage drivers but it also points to more prejudice that we basically treat people like animals... sure he’s half horse and it makes sense but whose to say he can’t be a politician or a professor... 

They highlight how an immigrant who has money is treated in the higher society... and it highlights corruption. 

They could do all of these things without fantasy and mythic beings but the allusions are wonderful and the symbolism is fantastic. It’s one of the best decisions and writer could make in their choice of novel. It’s meant to be a satire on our own society by using fantasy. Most fantasy and sci-fi novels have been doing this since fantasy and sci-fi created. However the time period is very wrong. They have blood types (not discovered until later) and the Pact has air ships. They’re using telegraphs and using Morse code... they use hand guns and they have bombs. If anything it’s a steampunk WW1 type of deal going on. But we also know that this is supposedly the 7th century so this is an alternate version of earth. I imagine more will be built on in season 2."

In season 1 episode 1 the coppers in the hall entrance as Philo walks in lot the constabulary are talking about a half-breed puck who only has tiny hooves and he was passing... so he must otherwise look human. We can assume he never grew his horns at all. It’s likely that pucks horns are much like a Rams and they have variances. Some of them have horns that jut forward and others that curl up tightly, and we know that they start at the brow line and some are more furrowed and tight and others are receded higher and less wrinkled looking. The older a Puck is the larger their horns seem to be and darker. Males typically have darker brows than females but this doesn’t seem to be uniformly true. The inner workings of their society have yet to be revealed to us but some sort of christian-like religion exists among a  radical group of pucks, but the religions is also somewhat commonplace however lacked among the Row."

I felt that pretty deeply. I also sort of associate the person who suffered the most... also died. It’s hard to explain to people who don’t have trauma... explaining that the child that “I was” died and suddenly the “adult me” was born. The child me suffered a lot and they died. I guess you hear it a lot from strangers that “oh no you had to grow up all of a sudden” it wasn’t like I grew up all of a sudden. The child me died and I took their place. And deep inside I wish I could go back and save them. Save that little kiddo from all of that is evil and terrible in the world, but instead I have to own up to the fact that terrible things happened. I have to go on and continue being strong.

Life is difficult teacher and no one makes it out alive. 

I think criminal minds Morgan’s dad said it best after he got tortured by SAS, “dying is easy, living is hard”

I have to remember that when I think about how much better it would be if I didn’t exist anymore or if I was dead. It’s easier to want to conquer life if you know that you will probably die at some point and you should do all you can to do the most good. My friend is having a baby, and I’m gonna be that little kids aunt. I have to be a good role model, and give her ice cream and buy her cute clothes. And do silly things with her. And change her diapers. Go to her graduation and be at her wedding. Her whole life is starting and I have to be here for it. And I can’t do that if I died. I’ve got to protect that little girl and make sure she doesn’t suffer like I did. Make sure she’s happy and healthy and give her parents a break once in a while. That’s the most good thing to do."

As someone who has had many partners, I have felt the same thing things as you have in the regard with partners praise or disgust. Disgust probably comes with their point of view, since you’ve had more partners it’s more likely you have an STD and therefore more likely to pass the STD to them. However, as long as you get regular Pap smears, STD texting you should be fine. Use condoms always (no exceptions unless your married and monogamous). Also it’s only his business if somehow you find out you have a serious STD and you need to track down who gave it to you to warn them.

relationship_advice,fmqoxsl,t3_fwkug6,1586303962.0,"As a child who grew up around horses I can definitely say having a ranch was worth it growing up. However. I will say my grandma (grandparents raised me) was very horse obsessed. Like crazy horse obsessed. 

STORY TIME: She would rather spend $40,000 on a yearling filly Andalusian from Mexico (so she paid for shipping costs etc..) than pay for my college education. My grandpa was very angry at her, yelling that she stole money from me and him. She also claimed that if she trained it up and showed the horse she could make a bunch of money from that and pay us back. Despite that it was an Andalusian and she had no experience with those and she hadn’t even put a saddle on the horse a year later. She used joint money to buy the filly and lost all of that money on something neither my grandpa or I hadn’t anything to do with. 

They separated for a few weeks and he really lost his shit. Finally he came home and he started sleeping in the bunk house. My grandpa was in the process of divorcing her, when he got diagnosed with cancer. They decided it was too difficult to get a divorce amongst paying for cancer treatment and put aside their differences and put all their money in a joint account. His insurance wouldn’t pay for chemo. He eventually died of cancer (after successfully battling the first bout with radiation and chemo and then a surgery it came back 6 months later very aggressive and killed him within 5 weeks of its return) 
My grandma ended up stealing his will and destroying it and took all of my inheritance. She ended up selling his pack horse (which was technically mine since my name was on her paperwork so she actually stole my horse and kept the money from selling her) and she sold the ranch and bought another house with a few acres. She ended up buying two mini horses and another mule (she already has one) Oh also she never showed the Andalusian and last I heard she sold it without even any training at the age of 5 years old I can only imagine she lost fuck loads of money on that horse and in the process she went into debt with cancer treatments and I was in debt with loans to pay for college. 

TAKE AWAY: Never believe anyone when they say “oh I’ll make money on this horse” it’s FALSE. Horses are a money SUCK. You have to pay for the fees. Pay for the tack and grooming tools. You have to pay for tools to clean up the barn and the stalls and to maintain the fields. You have to pay for a veterinarian. You have to pay for water (unless you are on a well). Not to mention pay a ferry to shoe your horse seasonally (unless you go barefoot which is not always possible for every horse since some horses just have naturally very soft feet). Since you have to spend all that money on all that stuff it’s best to save money on a hire and probably do it all yourself. So say goodbye to free time and say hello to a sore back and bad knees. Not to mention any other injuries caused by an aggressive horse or poor horsemanship.
Horse cost about $10,000+ a YEAR in Montana. To feed and take care of (there’s a wide range because it depends on your feed choices and how often they see a Veterinarian). Now that’s all just to take care of the horse and does not include even showing the horse. First you have to have training tack and show tack. Now you need a dedicated trailer and truck for this. Think about fuel costs to hall the animals to shows. And there’s registration costs. You need to register with your horses breeders association to be able to enter into most shows. You also need to register and pay fees to appear at shows. You also need to pay fees to dock your trailer and board your horse at the show, and probably a hotel unless you get the trailer with the sleeper, now you have to deal with sewage and water on the trailer. You basically have a tiny RV.  You can see how all of this SUCKS you’re money. And MOST shows do NOT have monetary prizes. They have statues or ribbons. The only thing showing does is accumulates titles for your horse, so then you can breed the horse and hopefully sell its offspring or you can just sell the horse. Hopefully your horse is worth more than when you bought it. But probably you won’t even make any of the money back that you spent on the horse in the 2 or 3 years you owned it or even to pay for the travel or shows. 

Make your own decision. I recommend confronting her about children and probably divorce her now.

She’s acting out because she’s trying to delay us leaving... don’t ever touch my granddaughter again.... get out of my house and get out of my life...” she left and I saw her again maybe 5 or 6 years later."

AskReddit,fle5luw,t3_fo40gu,1585078026.0,"This is sort of my story and sort of my moms and grandmothers. 

My grandmother (not biological and from now on I will call her the wife) was born in an upper middle class family, to two immigrants, one was Italian and the other was Swedish. Her older sister was adopted and they had an abusive relationship. Her father built a hotel empire and later he sold it all. When he does each daughter got 10million. She mostly lost it all on horses by the time she met my grandfather.

My grandfather was born to some old money family that lost all of their money in the 20’s due to the great stock market crash. They never lost their “we are better than everyone else” attitude. His father was a WW2 veteran and he beat my grandfather, and he had three younger siblings who he protected. He left home and joined the military. He left an E7. Wont go into details but her was special forces. He got a law degree and did some of that... then he worked for the CIA, doing organized crime stuff... He left and did some odd jobs. He became a ferryman and a cowboy up in Spokane WA. He met his wife joe ferrying her horses. She basically had not money left though, but they had a whirlwind romance and got married two months later. They invested their money right, he built a gym, and worked as a trainer, meeting some very influential celebrities (I won’t name drop but yes I grew up meeting celebrities) they did a lot of adventure races and for lots of sponsors. They had two homes one in Arizona and one in Montana where they split raising children. He had three kids from a precious marriage and she had three kids from two previous marriages. His youngest son lived with his mom. He never believed he was his dad because he was conceived and born while my grandpa was in Vietnam. His middle child was also conceived during a weird time frame, but there is no doubt my mom is his child, she looks identical to him the other two don’t look much like him at all.

My grandfather died from cancer in 2016, he basically raised me because my mom was single and she was a drug addict and also physically disabled and my grandpa was more or less my dad. All his friends and even his wife would refer to him as “your dad.” 

He and his wife had lost a lot of money in the 2008 housing market crash and the subsequent recession, but they had one house that was worth a little over 8 million.

When he died his wife had already been in the works seizing his assets and moving money from his bank accounts and closing his credit cards. She essentially stole my inheritance and hid both of his and her wills. (In the will I was his sole inheritor and all of their joint assets were meant to be sold and I was meant to inherit half of the sum of all of their joint assets, including inheriting all of his personal assets). But it was missing and no one has been able to find it. She claims she lost it in a move (he was his executor and vice verse since they both had accounting and law degrees and were licensed) and both wills were held together.

His previous will that our lawyers found would give my mom all of his assets (it was before I was born) which was in the 80’s... and was about $200,000, an airplane, two cars, a couple horses, some oil rights and some other stuff... but because he disinherited his two sons (when they were both under 18) the will is considered null since it is illegal to disinherit children under the age of 18. Now granted they are no longer 18, the will was made with the understanding that he was disinheriting supposed legitimate children under 18. 

(also he didn’t have the horses and the same cars and he didn’t have an airplane anymore so these assets would have been adjusted to include two different cars, a different horse, and some farm equipment and a little over $500,000 before his and his wife’s joint assets were sold which would be a sum total over 11 million). 

So I went from living in million dollar homes and driving 50 grand cars, acres of land and horses to ride and cows to show... to sleeping on friends couches and dropping out of college. She cut me out of her life as well and doesn’t speak to me. I was able to get one of his cars and some small personal affects due to some paperwork found where he was going planning to gift me the car. His wife tried to steal my car at one point (it was a Mercedes Benz and at the time was not worth a lot).

However things are looking up and friend and I are buying a house together.

I found some random keys in the car and we have not figured out where the keys go."

AskReddit,fl7fnoz,t3_eiazdt,1584900755.0,"Part of it is a ban to keep Yakuza out of public places, but no one is going to associate a white tourist with Yakuza. Another part is that they used to brand criminals when they left prison and then those people would go and get a tattoo to cover up the brand etc., in 1948 during American occupation foreigners legalized tattoos, but because the stigma is so ingrained in their culture, tattoos are just taboo. Any public bath house, pool, beach, gym, traditional inns, will ban tattoos. Organizations will not hire someone with tattoos or they can fire you if you get one. There is some push back from the government but mostly they do whatever they want. If you plan on going to Japan, expect to cover up at any tattoos at any temples or sacred sites. Book a private onsen and look for a Ryokan that does not discriminate. Just expect to cover your arms and legs. If you have face or neck tattoos good luck."

predator,fjyc4fw,t3_ff7rfm,1583693799.0,"Probably need to go back and study the first movie a bit before deciding to reboot. Part of the success of the first film comes from the fact that it wasn’t originally meant to be a sci-fi movie or was an action flick.. and was conceived as a one-hit monster movie... and Arnold as the front man... they never had sequels in mind. 

If rebooting the predator is possible it should more than likely never take place on earth ever again utilizing space (really calling it a SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE) or if it does be a modern take on the action thriller type. The original movie was happening shortly after Vietnam, and In the same decade there was a lot of stuff in the media about the Guadalajara Drug Cartel that moved cocaine from Columbian Mafias to North America. A lot of movies like this took place in jungle-beach paradises. Many of the other movies coming out in the same decade of the same type were Indiana Jones, Terminator, Rambo, Mad Max, and 007 movies. They were these bad ass dudes going in solving a mysterious circumstance, beating all bad guys, and come out on top. Lots of guns and battle and many of them took place in jungles and or hell-scapes. Predator does well because the whole time you think they’re out there against some guerilla’s in the jungle, when NEVER MIND ITS A CREATURE HUNTING US! It was a good tactic. You think that Arnold’s team will ultimately lose, the movie does a great job of convincing you, that right up until the last scene there is uncertainty of evil will win. We like this kind of bad guy, the bad guy who isn’t entirely human and who could easily beat the good guy. We like an anti-hero. The predator is hunting the humans because he’s convinced that the humans are the best of the best, and we are convinced of that by watching the 1st act and because the colonel tells us this too. And yeah, Arnold is the best of the best and beats the Predator. 

Aka the only reason the movie was good because you go in thinking it’s just like every other movie you’ve seen of  that type in the last 5 years and then all of a sudden you go “never mind no it’s not!” And it did it well.

The only way to reboot a predator creature of the same type is by exactly following up with what we want the predator to be, and alien-level anti-Hero or anti-villain. We can’t recreate the same setting and the same characters because it’s been so over-done that it’s a useless attempt. 

The action movies coming out in this decade are the titular main character as a singular male character who works for the big government doing spy shit. OR Marvel movies. We can’t really use a marvel movie for predator. But a sniper who is hunted down by a predator could certainly work. If it was a psycho-thriller and all his targets were being taken down before he got there... you see where I’m going. The sniper is being hunted and he doesn’t originally suspect it... it would work best if the movie wasn’t called the predator."

“Don’t dry with fakes fears” self explanatory mostly, don’t hang out with fake people and don’t let yourself get worked up over your fears or let them hold you back. 

“Climb up a mountain never coming down” this has two meanings one is a warning, not to isolate yourself from life or from people, but also to persevere and climb the mountain of difficulties and reach your dreams.

“Don’t live so wise” is sort of saying you need to be open to hearing other people and letting people help you, you can’t do everything on your own, and not to think your the smartest person in the room or that just because you’ve struggled you know everything about struggle. 

“Don’t cry, cuz your so right” is also a double meaning, 1 is affirmation that life is difficult, that there are painful realities and you have struggled, and you don’t need to justify anything about your struggle to anyone, your feelings are valid. meaning number 2 is about not shoving your struggles in others peoples faces, this is another build up on “don’t live so wise” aka do not believe that just because you had and experience that was difficult that you need to force other people to bare witness, this kind of reminds me of how boomers like to say things along the lines of “back in my day....” or when people who paid massive amounts of student loans go “we shouldn’t make college free because it’s not fair to everyone else who paid” or “I’m from a broken home that’s why I act out” modes of thinking around struggles.  It’s a warning against that mode of thinking, and encourages ownership or your struggles. Just because something isn’t your fault doesn’t mean your emotional trauma isn’t your responsibility and keep yourself in check. 

The first stanza itself is mostly an exposition of figuring your self out “what do you want/want to do in life?” And “find what motivates you and SHOW everyone your talents” aka walk the talk. Then keep reaching for your dreams, keep getting back up after you fall down no matter how hard the journey.

Most of the song is a reflection on the writers life choices and how he has regrets because of how he acted out in his teens. It’s meant as a warning, and inspiration, and guidance for going people. It’s nice to reflect on ones own life choices. I’m 23 and I love this song. It’s still hopeful for many people at many stages in life."

I agree Mackie did not convince me he was Takeshi Kovacs. He just felt like a side kick. Poe was a delight. It felt like one writer wrote the first two episodes, but then someone else stole it and wrote a fan-fic. I was excited to see that Takeshi was cross-sleeved and ready to kill a bounty hunter. That there was another mystery needing to be solved, and a dead meth... but... then it got very “the 100” season 6. Bleh. Vomit. Contrived. I was hoping that quell-crest was going to be a bad guy actually working for Harlan, but instead it was Kemp, and I was sick all over again. I guess it was cool that she could use angel-fire. But it was literally so obvious that Harlan was dead... I’d wished he was pulling the strings all along. But alas. Wished that the elder got what they wanted and murdered everyone would have been an better ending."

A lot of special DLC for holidays... it will probably not surpass Skyrim, and most people will struggle to quit ESO, but then Bethesda and Zenimax will probably reward ESO players for getting ESVI, and incorporate some kind of “if you have X achievements in ESO you can have X in ESVI” OR if you bought XYZ you can get this DLC for free.

This person is talking about when people trivialize PTSD and turn it into a joke. Not comparing PTSD or traumas.

Ex2: “anyone else have PTSD from watching that video of Rhett and Link making a human Peep? Haha” yes they’re acknowledging that something was uncomfortable and gross but they’re utilizing a very serious psychological syndrome to describe a momentary discomfort in watching a humorous video. Which is wrong. People already don’t understand PTSD, and its hard enough for veterans (the only people I think get taken seriously about PTSD) to be given adequate treatment and respect, so no I don’t like it when people trivialize my trauma. People who compare traumas have deeper inner problems and should probably consult a therapist. But comparing traumas is not what we are taking about. Yes people can develop PTSD over many different things, but it has to fit the definition and diagnosis parameters, having taken a difficult exam and right afterward being anxious about your results and being exhausted by the difficulty does not constitute PTSD."

dogs,fdhyje0,t3_ele34n,1578432497.0,"I recommend video-taping the weird incidents of her swinging the dog or putting him up high. Police only respond to video evidence. 

I had a roommate a few years ago who abused her puppy similarly, and would invite the dog up on the couch then when the puppy got too playful she would kick the puppy off the couch or throw her. I’ve seen her grab her puppy by the scruff and throw her across the living room. Leave her outside without water for hours, kick her, push her into objects on purpose, hit her with the leash when she wasn’t listening or walking her... throw dog toys at her.
I had a dog at the time and I told her I was uncomfortable with her behavior. She ignored me. Later on I would come home from work and my dog would be bruised in places. I called the police but they told me that unless I had witnessed her hurt my dog there was nothing I could do. One time I came home and my dog was limping really badly, and holding her leg up. I took her to the pet ER, no broken bone but a lot of bruising. I called the police again, still nothing I could do. Any of this could have been caused by playing too hard with her puppy according to the officer I spoke with... the puppy weighed like 15-25lbs and my dog was 80lbs healthy highly unlikely... And my dog had played with much larger dogs and never been bruised up. And I’ve seen her play with the puppy, she was very gentle. 
When I moved out, the landlord was friends with my roommate because my roommate had dated his son a long time ago, and he tried to keep my deposit because my roommate said my dog dug holes in the yard. My dog never dug  holes it was her puppy (who escaped many times by digging under the side gate when she locked her outside) and I was able to get the majority of my deposit back by providing video evidence of her dog digging under the gate and running away, but they used some of my deposit to clean my room (which I had provided receipts of a carpet cleaner I rented but they claimed it needed a professional clean which was not in my lease) it was a horrible situation I blasted his rental company. 
I see my landlord sometimes in public. Occasionally I see my old roommate. Her dog is no longer around (no pics on social media at all or mention of her) She also abuses her horses (I won’t go into details) but some people just have no idea they are abusive. 
I found out later that my dog got the bruises because my roommate would open the front door and if my dog was at the door to greet her she would push her into the wall really hard using the door and she would then throw her into my room. A few times she locked both the dogs outside without water for 7 hours in the blistering sun. I came home from work and they were hiding in the shade panting. Drank a whole bowl of water when she came in. The dogs have bowls outside that we fill up with the water from the side of the house but she had not filled them up or left the door open (we have the automatic/magnetic closing screen). I told her never to put my dog outside, she said “well it’s hard to hold your dog back when I let mine out” so I replied “don’t ever lock her out of the house again, if you let them out bring them back in after they’re done outside!” She claimed she forgot and that it’s not her job to take care of my dog. Even though she is the one that locked her outside. My dog was Trained as a service dog (she washed for being too protective of her handler around male dogs.) So in no way was it possible for my dog to ever ignore a command. She was just lazy since her puppy peed or pooed in the house a lot. 

This same roommate threw away all my food that was in the fridge one time because she didn’t have room for a ton of stuff she got at Costco. Not just perishable fridge stuff, she took all my food out of the freezer and the pantry. Not some of it. ALL of it. And she threw a lot of it on the floor. And even across the house. She was loud on purpose. I was in my room and I came out to check on the noise. When I began picking up my food I asked her why she was throwing my food out, she said “because I need room for my stuff!” It wasn’t like i was taking up a majority of the space. We all had separate shelves in the pantry and the fridge, and the freezer was separated too. She would also use my dishes and pots and pans. She ruined several Teflon pans. She would refuse to do dishes and say “those are your dishes!!” (the dishes themselves belonged to me but she was the one who made them dirty I’m a clean-as-I-go person). She was psycho."

brakebills,fc433sf,t3_efr9oi,1577405366.0,When Penny 40 told Penny 23 to “do it” he means make Julia a human. And probably it fulfills some more interesting plot development in season 5 and probably we aren’t done with her godliness.

Happened the other day when I was accused of faking it to get away from the front desk: something caused me to flashback and panic but the thing wasn’t immediately associated with my traumatic incident and so a coworker who knew the story decided to tell everyone how the thing that caused my “meltdown” wasn’t related to my PTSD and everyone thought I was faking it (the “meltdown”)"

Get an attorney. It’s impossible to prove you killed someone and especially if she had mental illness... not going to work so probably the most damage they can do it just prove in a court of law that you don’t deserve as much money from her will because of being estranged, but that’s it’s."
