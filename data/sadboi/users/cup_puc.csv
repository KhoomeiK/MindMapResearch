Things may be tough but your son needs you, I wish my dad was here for me everyday (he's not dead just really distant) your son is gonna need a father figure and you're the only one who can give him that fatherly love. Please rethink what you're planning on doing and stay, for your son."

SuicideWatch,f4yo1hd,t1_f4ucgpv,1571881035.0,That's what I'm realizing now my depression was caused from people at my school and skipping made me think I could find mental peace but you just become more stressed and depressed because of bad grades. The worse part is when your friends don't bother to text your of check in to make sure your ok. That part truly makes me feel alone

SuicideWatch,f4k2amr,t3_dkrmv8,1571632816.0,"It feels like even my brain doesn't want to be friends with me. The damn thing makes me feel ok then out of nowhere it makes me feel sad, mad and alone, like what did I do wrong to be so alone. My own family is slower moving out of my life when I need them the most. If it weren't for my mom, dad and one good friend I would end it all. Glad some people still care."
