Therapy can only take you so far, and medication takes care of the rest*



*I’m not suggesting that medication is the cure all or for everyone, but it’s been a game changer for me. As I put it, it delays my reaction to my triggers, allowing myself to redirect my brain from :feel>react>think: to :feel>think>react:"

Instead of trying to force your brain into the moment, redirect it to the bigger picture. See the bigger picture, not the moment but everything around it. What have I done that’s helped me and is this feeling in the moment going to help me and what am I going to do in the future to help me?

I know it’s difficult, especially in that moment, but we can try to remind ourselves that we are more that moment."

And by “trans-friendly”, the surgeon I eventually went with understood that I had no desire to go on T but it was still an affirming surgery for me."
