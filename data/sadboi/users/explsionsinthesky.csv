And they did give up everything, their entire lives, for us and never care about how good THEY look (they never spend money on their clothes etc, only on ours so they almost always look like they're from an entire different social class from us). So I feel horrible complaining to them about this, but they seem to think that if we have money, then that's happiness. But I want emotional freedom, and freedom in general"
raisedbynarcissists,erilxxf,t1_erf75jw,1560901098.0,"I know them so well regarding their stance and thoughts on mental health and I am 100% sure that their response to that would be that if I can break that easily, I'm mentally sick and should get hospitalized."
raisedbynarcissists,erilvhx,t1_erf5nld,1560901048.0,"1. my mom actually came up with that boundary - I actually thought of seeing her during breaks and maybe once or twice outside of breaks. I was surprised to hear she wants to see me every few weeks and I couldn't say no because she and my dad were already talking about me staying over at their house during weekends and bringing my friends over. 
2. I used to make that excuse as well when I first started to get tracked. My mom just bought me a portable charger lol..and I don't know how and when I could get another phone and pay the bills for it - my mom tracks my bank account and also pays for my phone bills. I also need my smartphone with me at all times to talk to some important people in my life who are not in the country (complicated). If I didn't, I'd leave my phone in my dorm in a heartbeat. Even so, if my mom can't reach me for a few hours, she will literally come find me in my dorm. my mom couldn't do this to my brother so instead, she'd make me contact his friends and roommates and find her. 
3. That's true, I can definitely use that. It's just that they will , and always have gotten back at me about it. I did try my best and everything, but oftentimes i needed time for myself, especially when i was severely depressed (I spent a lot of time crying in my room writing my feelings out). So of course, I didn't get a perfect GPA or get into ivy schools. But my mom would say, ""you spent ALL that time studying, refusing to spend time with me and you didn't get better scores"". 
4. I plan on doing that. I want to set up my own bank account soon, but I'm a bit of a novice when it comes to real life stuff because my parents have always insisted to do it all for me. So they have direct access to my stuff right now and they still continue to insist they will set up a savings account for me. I want to figure out how to do it myself right now without them finding out..

Sorry for the late response. I really, really appreciate your thoughtful and considerate responses though. I'm in a tough situation and I feel really anxious all the time"
raisedbynarcissists,erf4tqa,t1_erf3qxt,1560800027.0,"I'm scared that it will be too late, or it will be too long until I can live in my own conditions and values instead of theirs. I just wish they could support me unconditionally and respect that I have my own views on my own life. 
The relationships outside of my family that I have now are scarce, but they are what are keeping me sane and happy. But because of my parent's control over me and their harsh words about my relationships (they do not approve and are only wanting to end them), they are getting tired of it since somehow, unfairly, my parents are affecting them as well. 
I just really want to escape this so that I can build a life on my own on my own terms, without them telling me that I can't because they know what's best for me and I have to do exactly what they say or else I'll regret it and come crying back to their arms. 
They also always subtly hint these things by referencing other parents and how their children betrayed them and went off to have a ""worse"" (less rich) life and how ridiculous it seems."
raisedbynarcissists,erf4eqh,t1_ereqj4m,1560799750.0,"It feels like I break down too easily. The littlest thing can make me feel horrible the rest of the day and be unproductive and hurt other relationships. I dont know if it's because of the way I was raised or if somethings fucked up with me but its so exhausting..
I'm just terrified to tell the truth to a therapist or any professional/official person who has power to lock me up. I don't want them doing shit without my say in it because my experience with them what I think didnt matter because I was ""insane"" to them. 
I think that too. My brother is my only best best friend I can always depend on though. He has even said that NC is an option and that if my parents ever end up refusing to stop financially supporting me because of a falling out, then he'll gladly help me."
raisedbynarcissists,erf4692,t1_ereylgd,1560799593.0,"I do not qualify for financial aid and they do not consider familial relationships (as long as I have legal parents who can afford it they don't give me money). But I will look into counseling on campus, hopefully free of cost 
Thank you."
raisedbynarcissists,erf42n7,t1_erf1n3x,1560799526.0,"That definitely does sound familiar. I'm sorry you're going through this as well. 
I'm scared of going no contact. My parents have always told us that we have to stick together given that we're all we have (us 4) in the country. And my mom gets very lonely because my father isn't home a lot. So lately she's been grasping onto me, trying to do everything with me lately and gets upset when I say no. 
I'm going to university in the fall. It's a 10 minute drive from home..not very feasible, my mom wants to see me every few weeks at the minimum. 
I don't know how to get therapy without their knowing, because they will definitely get upset about it. And they track my location so..and I have been looking up a lot about this and I'm shocked to realize I'm relating so much to it. But I'm scared, I don't want to frame my parents just because I'm pissed about them being strict or harsh at times. I'm scared my parents will say that I've been brainwashed by the media to make my own parents the enemy (they've said this stuff before)"

SuicideWatch,erac3to,t3_c0xzub,1560639828.0,"when i talked to them i just wanted someone to talk to. i wouldn’t have tried to hurt myself again if they had just listened and not fucking sounded like mind numbing robots saying shit like “i hear you” “it must be hard” like no fucking shit. 
they just called the ambulance on me, outed me to my entire family without warning. had me locked up in a hell of a psych ward for days until my parents had to get on their knees to beg me not to get my involuntarily committed. i got out of there feeling worse than ever. 
so thanks, suicide prevention line. for making everything worse for me and exposing me to my entire family who is completely unaccepting of mental health. now i’m more afraid than ever to reach out in fear of being outted and fucking punished for expressing my feelings, just like how i always felt at home"
