I’m type two bipolar so my highs weren’t as high and didn’t feel like much of a problem. Then I had a massive nightmareish episode and then after waiting a couple months to see a psychiatrist I was diagnosed as bipolar type two. After that episode I went through rapid cycling for months, I feel liked something broke in my head during that episode and I can’t get back to how I was before."

bipolar,fns9df8,t3_g3lqp4,1587216365.0,"Trigger warning
Me too. Even on good days I feel like I’m loosing touch with reality. Last night I was super upset, just distraught and all I could think about was sneaking out of the apartment going to the park nearby with beach and just swimming out until I couldn’t. The waters cold enough I’d probably die of exposure before drowning.
I especially worry what effect it would have if I had kids, I wouldn’t want them to see that. Is it even fair to submit a child to a bipolar mother? Do I rush passing it on? My mother’s mother and sister are clearly undiagnosed bipolar or something else. They didn’t know enough back then but they know now, like how could I even risk passing it on to a kid. But at the same time I want kids so badly but even if I adopt they’d still be subjected by all my bull shit. 
I feel like my head and heart are burning up just think about it."

mentalillness,fmznuu0,t3_fy4rex,1586525602.0,As some one with an ED it definitely sounds like you have one. You should nip this in the bud before things get worse. Tell your doctor and figure what changes you need to make in life to keep a head of it. EDs suck.

I do it’s still not enough to make me remotely dependant, nothing is. I just feel like the side that fails, maybe it’s just me, gets ignored in media. They’re doing the whole manic pixie dream girl thing. I’m not throwing shade anyone who survives this mental shitstorm and can rise to the top go them. Honestly I’m not even sure what I’m angry about I can’t clearly remember because that’s what my meds do to me.

Not saying you’ll fail, I just feel like I will. I have no financial independence, and I rely so much on others. I hate it, I feel so incapable, any time someone says or does something patronizing or that I think is patronizing I go on a rampage. 

Also beauty awards? Wtf, we’re giving away awards to people with better genie manifestations? Like you are literally awarding people who randomly hit the genetic jackpot. Physically anyways. The hell is wrong with society? Sorry rant done."
