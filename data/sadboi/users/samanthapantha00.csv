She went, ‚Äúoh really? Well are they sure because he had issues with his diabetes.‚Äù It‚Äôs hopeless folks. She wont care til it‚Äôs her own mother or brother."
CoronavirusUS,foz5gb0,t1_foz3z3t,1588184999.0,"Yeah, that sums up exactly how im feelingüòûnext phase: everyone will be mourning and crying when anyone they know passes away. And i‚Äôll be cast to be the asshole when I find it hard to have any sympathy. Their actions will have the most detrimental consequences and they‚Äôre so consumed by denial and their entitlement. There aren‚Äôt enough distractions in the world to overcome how frustrating it all is, while it‚Äôs happening in slowww mo. Someone hit the fast forward button!"
CoronavirusUS,foytab5,t3_gabkt6,1588178768.0,I come to reddit because this is the only place I can find people who are awake and GET IT. I feel like Im in this bad dream where everyone around are sheep zombies and Im the only one who is conscious!!! Even friends who originally ‚Äúgot it‚Äù are now sorta just ready to go back to ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù How are you guys coping with that sort of reality?? Because yesterday I got random urges to cry and that‚Äôs completely not normal for me. I think the helplessness and stupidity everywhere is reaching a critical levelüò©

CoronavirusUS,foqy601,t1_foqvng3,1588002881.0,"When people say herd immunity, im not sure I understand what that means because you can most likely get it more than once, and there‚Äôs a good possibility there can be lasting damage to vital organs, it can weaken the heart, I‚Äôve read articles on psychology today about how they believe it can damage the brain etc. Like yeah sure I might be immune for a few months, but I could be walking around with a weaker heart and then maybe the following year when I get it again it‚Äôs a death blow.........Where was this herd immunity that‚Äôs gonna save me?? Or how does it even matter? Is there an elite 500 people that can just sustain life getting covid every year of their lives and thats what were banking on? Of course we all think we‚Äôre that special. we get be the chosen fewü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
CoronavirusUS,foqrbfa,t3_g8xh3b,1587999403.0,"I keep hearing them say, ‚Äúall you have to do is wash you hands‚Äù Do these people not realize our govt just wants to exploit them for work and gives zero fucks about whether they live or die.... I feel like everyone around me is blind or retarded. Like Im in a nitemare where Im the only one who GETS it. I saw a news article about why theres ‚Äúno reason to wipe down your groceries.‚Äù totally safe.
Meanwhile a month prior same news source showed a chart of how the virus can survive up to 3 days on metals, 2 days on plastics, etc. WHAT fucking sense would it make to tell people to not wipe down metal cans of food and plastic bottles Im bringing into my house then?!?!? This is natural selection time folks. Wake up or get wrecked"

Autoimmune,foh7mfd,t3_g6pz16,1587761431.0,"Same here. 1:640 titer, fine speckled. Severe hair loss, joint pain, fatigue 30yr female. I‚Äôd say Ive lost 90% of my hair within the past year and a half. The most they could find was slightly low c4 complement which they‚Äôre saying is a ‚Äúgenetic defect‚Äù and slightly low ferratin. Told me to come back once a year to monitor. 

It‚Äôs so frustrating. I dont even want to be in public or be social when i look so awful. Losing your hair is dehumanizing and so frustrating that they could care less. Goodluck on your journey and be persistent!"
