You do not have to live in their shadows. You can learn (slowly) to become the person u want to be. It will take hard work, but it is possible! This is what I’m doing for myself. 

Im trying to learn how to love myself after all the abuse and trauma my family gave me. It’s never too late to try to work on yourself❤️"
AmItheAsshole,fp5dtaq,t3_gb8ydy,1588325632.0,"NAH. I worked for a bit with adults with Alzheimer’s and dementia and they have no idea what they are saying sometimes. You did warn your gf. She can be upset, and you can empathize with her. But honestly it is not your grandmas fault not yours she said that."
AmItheAsshole,fp5crtj,t1_fp5b7w6,1588324515.0,"Hah the post was deleted, but I read the comments. His parents did get an arranged marriage. He is born and raised in USA so he has many western beliefs. Tbh I would even argue that he is a little “white washed”. I go over to his house and talk to his parents. I’m 100% sure that they know we are dating or so, he just hasn’t brought it up to them and tells them I’m just a friend. I don’t think my bf would ever get an arranged marriage. In fact, I asked him if he would ever get one if me and him weren’t dating....  but he told me that he is more than capable of finding someone he likes here in America. To which I 100% agree. He is not bad looking at all, and is extremely smart. A lot of girls find him attractive, and he can be very charismatic hahah."
AmItheAsshole,fp4fqn3,t1_fp4dxio,1588298078.0,"Hahah the pregnancy came to us as a surprise. We didn’t know I was pregnant. Long story short, I ended up in the hospital because it was ectopic (meaning it is not in the uterus but in the tube). So I was literally bleeding out. I was in the hospital for 3 days. He just told his parents I had an ovarian cyst. He didn’t want to tell his parents I was pregnant because he told me that if they knew they would try to pull us apart, and make him stop seeing me. To me this was stupid, his parents have a lot of money and cover all of his expenses. Even got him a m3 car. He is extremely smart, went to the top public university in economics and such. But he yet was still scared of his parents. The pregnancy was super hard for me. I couldn’t walk for 6 weeks, and It was so so hard on my mental health. But yeah,,, I feel like I’m being hidden, and should be taken more seriously than just a regular girl."

When I asked him how he dealt with the drama and stuff he told me he learn to not care. We all live in usa, so there’s a lot of cultural differences. I’m Latina, and I know how conservative parents can be. Which is why I was ok with it at first. But I also think he just doesn’t want to present me as his gf, because he doesn’t like confrontation."
AmItheAsshole,fp4ds73,t1_fp4ch1h,1588296896.0,"True, I just don’t know if I should be ok with that. At the beginning I was very accepting of him not telling his parents. I used to go to his house almost every day. His parents even already suspect it, I don’t think they are that stupid. He just doesn’t want to bring up the “pink elephant in the room.” It does make me feel like he doesn’t want to stand up for our relationship or has me hidden."
AmItheButtface,fooeiu1,t1_fomzdui,1587937536.0,"Yeah it was really scary. I didn’t even know I was pregnant. I went to the hospital because I though I was having very bad cramps and was on my period. Turns out I was bleeding out to death and was pregnant. It was soo traumatic honestly. I think I had a deep depression soon after. I was having anxiety attacks every other day and I would just stay in my bed.


 On top of that I was dealing with my bfs mom freaking out while in the hospital.  At first I had felt bad for her cause I saw it as a sign of her just trying to get attention. I can understand how she puts all her efforts in controlling her children since there’s nothing else that she does. But she’s been so mean to me and tells my bf she doesn’t like me and such. She doesn’t know anything I have gone through. I told my bf to tell her what happened in efforts to make her more empathetic.... but he tells me that if he tells her, she will freak out and make us not see each other again."

But I told her I felt like i wanted to die once cz I was venting out. rather than her listening to me she just called the cops and they took me into the mental hospital . I literally begged her to not do that. I didn’t even have a plan or anything. I was just feeling down when I had said it to her thinking she would lend me an ear and understand my current situation. Being at the hospital it was a nightmare being there. Worst thing I’ve ever experienced in my life. Not only did I have to deal with the fact that I was literally bleeding out, and was pregnant. But I also was placed in a mental hospital. So after I got out I just blocked her I quit working there and I never talked to her ever since.  
In America, a mental hospital is EXTREMELY defunded. Being there is no better than being in a jail and expecting someone to get better. They don’t help at all. 

Anyways sorry I’m venting^

Prior to this it didn’t matter what I was doing, or going through because I was always ok. If I was sad I would just go to the gym, go hiking, go out... do stuff. I had friends and If I didn’t I just made some. It’s never been hard for me to talk to anyone. U wouldn’t think I was this depressed if u would of met me before. 


Now I’m SRS depressed. I’m not just “sad,” ...I’m genuinely depressed. I can stay in my bed and starve myself because I’m too tired to even get out depressed. The only thing I get out of my bed for is my new job... at a gas station. I am nothing now. I feel so worthless. And alone. I haven’t talked to anyone about this.

Honestly I feel like I just have really really bad luck cz it’s always one thing after another. I keep trying and then something happens. And I’m just done.... again, this did it for me.

But this did it for me. I’m seriously really depressed. I really don’t need advice. I just wanted someone to listen to me.... because I Dont talk to anyone about this. At least so that I know that someone knows that I existed and why I killed myself. Cz I think everyone else thinks I’m just ok....
SuicideWatch,fl0f223,t1_fl0e8pq,1584704187.0,"Idk, I really don’t know. I think some of it it’s my fault. Sometimes I get so depressed I get mad at him, and part of me blames him for what happened. My life was fine before any of this.  He kinda grew up rich, and never had to worry about anything but himself. He doesn’t even have to work. His family buys him everything. Me, I literally need to have a job and I live on my own. When this happened I lost the previous job I had cause I couldn’t even walk. I was bleeding for like 3 months continuously. And he always ALWAYS seemed fine. Nothing that happened to me never concerned him emotionally. He has been there physically, but that’s it. He just doesn’t seem to care enough or idk. 
He tells me he is trying to make this work out but then he just ends up acting cold or indifferent because we always have fights. I think he just thinks I can get over things like nothing. And I just can’t. He is not very empathetic. He doesn’t know how to. He just gets anxious or angry when I get upset. And anything kinda sets him off. For example, I could say I want to kill myself 100 times and the moment I say “you are dumb” or something he just blows up on me. 

Idk how to answer ur question, if i was ok I would have left maybe a long time ago. Im not ugly, I would of just dated other guys. It’s never been an issue for me. But rn he is literally the only person I can depend on. After this happened I became SEVERELY depressed. I couldn’t even get out of my bed for weeks. I’m fcking miserable. I don’t talk to anyone cz I’m so embarrassed. Living like this ain’t living. I just made my choice already. And I’m ok with dying. Tomorrow I’m going to do it. I already have all the things I need. I’m so tired of everything. U have no idea how lonely I really am. This is coming from someone who used to be out literally every day before this happened. Now, I’m traumatized about what happened.

relationship_advice,fkdkbwc,t3_fhmvab,1584082174.0,"Am I the only one who thinks that you should have talked to try to talk to her first rather than just calling the police at her job? 

The mental health system is extremely defunded in America. In some cases people actually end up having a worst experience in the mental hospital than otherwise being left alone. Or just having the person seek help by therapy. In case you are Not aware, in a mental hospital they just watch you continuously and literally give you meds. Sometimes the doctors are not the best. (This is all depending in the area you are placed). My point is, I think seeing what’s up with her FIRST and then having her seek help would have been an alternative. 

Im not saying what you did was wrong. I’m just thinking it could have been handled differently. Again, I personally believe talking to the person first and seeing what’s going on would have been a better option rather than just dialing 911 right away while she was working. It shows that you are there to listen and empathize.
However, it does sound like you are rather annoyed at the situation and felt like something needed to happen. 
Which I understand, but I can also see how the family can be a little mad at you. 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

I hope things get better with your situation, and I would say that rather than judge her by saying she’s trying to manipulate maybe try to see that she could potentially be going through something and maybe try being a little kind or empathetic. Maybe that would help. 

I offer a different approach because I know people who have said that wanted to die and ended up in a mental hospital, but were treated terribly, and felt even worst after."

I haven’t really hung out with any of my friends after what happened to me. For months I’ve been depending heavily on him. But I think breaking things off would kinda obligate meto reach other to others. And do things on my own.

Again, thank you for replying It truly does help for me to think clearly when I converse with someone else. Sorry for the typos. Thank you for reaching out to me. It really truly does help."
SuicideWatch,fjvdm4w,t3_ff1i2a,1583626104.0,"You know, I how it feels to want to end your own life. I just posted I was tired of living last night as well. But I started having second thoughts. I don’t know you, but maybe we can both try to battle this together. 

...look back and laugh at the fact we once posted this because our lives are better in the future. 
Or maybe not, maybe we still have issues, real life problems. Yet we somehow still manage to overcome them. We can use this same feelings to write a book about how to overcome the biggest obstacle of all... ourselves. Or something... maybe we can use this to inspire others just like I’m trying to talk to you right now and reach out to you even though I’m also feeling the same way. 

Again, I know how this feels. But I hope we both overcome this."
relationship_advice,fjvc06i,t1_fjvadcs,1583625529.0,"Yeah I think I’m just going to talk to him about ending things. I see myself re-reading this and honestly I think you are right. Maybe trying to end things on a good note. I still depend heavily on him because after what happened to me with the ectopic pregnancy I lost my job, and recently got a new one, but I have a lot of debt. I depend on him for rides and such to my new job and going groceries shopping. I’m also still dealing with the trauma and this depression that I got left with because of the event that happened. My self steam also is very low. 

Maybe talking to him about breaking up but him still being able to help me out would be better for both of us. Just like friends. I don’t doubt he loves me
I just think that because we are both relatively young we don’t know how to deal with things. We are both literally going crazy. It’s been a very crazy experience. 

I do love him and I know he cares, so I think breaking things off would release a lot of stress for both of us. 

Thank you for taking the time to reply to this. I don’t really talk to people or such about what happened to me or what is going on because it’s hard for me. It helps to really clear my thoughts when I talk to others. 
Thank you"
SuicideWatch,fjowuh3,t3_fej3jw,1583536501.0,I’m on the same shoes as you. I feel the same exact way tbh. Let’s be friends.
