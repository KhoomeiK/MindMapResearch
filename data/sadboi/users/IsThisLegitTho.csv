Recently I‚Äôve been doing a little work over time and now I put it all together last minute. I guess I still like the rush. I‚Äôm moving away from that now and doing a little more sooner.

It feels great to finish before a deadline and use the time between now and the deadline to either submit the assignment and move on OR spend time making it better.

It was really hard work and discipline going from total procrastination to chipping away at the work over time.
It is STILL hard work.

I like to think ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm going to be annoyed by something they do, but I wonder what?‚Äù You have to expect messes to be made. Always have them clean up and just explain being careful prevents messes and no messes means less time cleaning up and more time doing other things. This is just one example of how you can think about things a little differently with a positive view. 
Another thing is to start talking to them like adults early on and just be patient kind and gentle. If you talk to them like adults they‚Äôll feel like they have adult type standards to fill. 
Just be curious about your kids, talk to them. Like an actual conversation about whatever. If they‚Äôre difficult, try and dig deeper than ‚Äúhow was your day?‚Äù
