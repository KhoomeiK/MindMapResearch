bipolar,epx930d,t3_bw4foc,1559594944.0,"The lies to myself dig the deepest.  Professionals refer to it as ""disassociation""  To me it is like having my sick mind push me aside, wrestle control of my body from me, and betray me as it forces my mouth to say things.  When this happens it's like I am outside my body watching, screaming for ""me"" to shut up, walk away, die, anything, just stop doing that thing where my mouth moves and sounds come out.

But no.  Once my brain is finished ruining a friendship, or a special moment, it steps aside. I am back in my body, humiliated, mortified at what my mind just did.  I am left with a choice, admit I'm pretty much insane, or an asshole.

Either one I pick is a lie."

The answer you will get, 99.9% of the time will be something along the lines of ""so they dont turn it off"".  This belies a punitive approach to life.  

The answer should be, ""Because I owe it"".  This is the response of someone of integrity."

AskReddit,eoe12fn,t3_brehsn,1558485716.0,"Back in HS my best friend had a piano room that seemed constantly under construction.  It was also a time I was going through a weird ""no pot"" phase.  A phase my friend was not going through.  

One day while we sat around his table while he ate cat kibble from a foil pouch *side note* you'd <i> think </i> this would have been huge red flag  but the guy was one sharp fry short of a happy forest to begin with.  Anyway he tells me they finished the piano room.  I replied ""Finally ""  to which he says  ""Piano room"".  Thinking he didn't understand me, I looked him in the face and repeated ""Finally ""  He placed both hands on the table, looked me dead in the eye and said v e r y slowly, Pee-Ann-no Rooom!""  Nonplussed I just as slowly said ""Fi-Nul-lee"".

He then sat back, cleared his throat, popped another kibble in his mouth and calmly offered,""oh, I thought you said 'Family' because that would have been stupid""."
