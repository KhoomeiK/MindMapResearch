Also, doing online programs disqualify you from receiving any BAH at all.  There are TONS of stipulations for using the GI Bill.  I went to a community college with a VA resource center.  It was a constant run around and I would not have been successful without them to help.  Having someone familiar with the rules of the GI Bill helping you along the way is the way to go."

Veterans,fh4u418,t3_f17so0,1581282140.0,Similar experience.  I'm so sorry you had to experience that.
ptsd,fgp303l,t3_dzw9yx,1580995455.0,So. Bad.   It's terrifying to close my eyes.   Thank you for reminding me that I am not alone.
