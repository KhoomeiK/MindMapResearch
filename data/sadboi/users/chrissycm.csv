For you directly...

He is willing to look for unusual allies - so it is not unreasonable he would take a risk in you. As for what you owe him... 
[From wiki] ""Suitable gifts had to be brought before him, including vast amounts of wealth, valuable secrets about his rivals, a mass of insignificant individual souls or a soul of singular importance, and rarely were one of those considered enough.Â ""
... even bringing some valuable secrets about his enemy would be something he would be interested in. He uses information very well. Souls may push your characters goodness... but some secrets you uncover about his (evil) enemy... well....

For me (personally- in case this sparks ideas) I tried looking at his most admirable traits to embody....

She is good, but her connection to Levistus had left me a bit stumped.  Most evil gods have some redeeming traits and it is also true with Levistus. (1) he is fair,  if he challenges you to a duel, it will be a fair fight and he will honor the outcome (he is also very, very good - so he expects to win - but he is also honorable to a fault.). (2) He has more souls than anyone. Why? Because he sought those that were forgotten.  He has the least organized followers, but everyone else dismissed them. (3) he has few underworld allies - he would likely join right in a rebellion against most of the evil powers. (4) not really a ""good"" but not evil either. He is supposed to be charming AF. 

So, my character is charming, looks out for the little guys, and honorable.  (Didn't do anything directly with #3, but mentioned it in case it becomes relevant.)

I don't know how much these help or if they spark any ideas.  Also, as you said - he is very powerful (knowable, slippery, manipulative) and the ends can justify the means right?"

Many, many jobs just want to see a degree. It doesn't matter if it is ""in"" the industry for many. 

If you specifically really want to work for the subject you studied- then you can fight for it. The stereotypes are from so many people who expect to be handed it, or that the degree will result in a job in that industry, and that isnt accurate. Some degrees don't get your foot in the door even if it gets you the education. If you want one of those, go for very specific jobs like pharmacy. Liberal arts degrees can be applied... liberally. My example for this is my husband. Got his masters in Anthropology. Loves it. He has used that degree very directly (digs in romania) and for things that are a stretch (teaching high school chemistry).  The ones he has to fight for to get the most are the most directly his degree. He uses connections he has built, skills he has learned, experiences he's had... the easy ones are usually the ones that don't seem to relate. (Like teaching high school)... but you will never see him say the fighting isn't worth the fight.... and no matter what he does, he breathes Anthropology. Even in part time just-money jobs he has taken like working for a moving company ... he used his skills to bridge communication gaps, find excitement in his day, or teach someone something new. He cannot put it down because he is passionate.  He has had many colleges who ""dropped out"" of the Anthropology scene because they liked learning, but they didn't want to fight.

They literally do not have enough tests. They are limiting those tests to people where it could impact the way they handle treatment. That means that yes, usually if a 19 year old gets it, the best answer is self-quarantine and assume you have it because chances are you won't need hospitalization (there are exceptions to this,  but the hospital is playing a number game and hoping you fit the typical.) Self-quarantine,  minimize spread (good idea if this is Covid 19 or a ""viral lung infection"" because if you get both infections, or someone else gets both, it will be way worse.) Hold off on going in unless you need hospitalization. Almost every health recommendation I have seen says to avoid going physically into the doctor if you just ""suspect"" you might have it, because it aids in transmitting to the most vulnerable.

TLDR: you dont see the whole picture, you are way more talented than you give yourself credit for - and they have advantages you are not aware of.

When I was in 6th grade I started playing the cello. I was horrible, of course I was. I had just started playing and I was a kid. The person who I shared a music stand with would memorize the music. Make a point of stating as such if I put music up there. I ended up trying to pretend that I had also memorized it, resulting in me just pretending to play half the time. He was clearly the best cellist - and he had started playing at the same time as me. I didn't give myself a chance to do well because I was trying too hard.

Hindsight: (1) memorizing is my weakness. Getting after myself for one of the things I am weakest out without recognizing my strengths was really ridiculous. (2) it was not his first instrument. He had been doing music for years. If I went back to that music I would have it memorized after a play or two also. He was only learning the cello. I was learning how to read music, how to hear the notes... all of it. He got to put that energy into being ""better"" and have a head start. It wasnt him being naturally better or me.being inferior.  The fact that I kept up with him as well as I did was actually evidence of my skill.

Then, when I got older I continued to play, and I never got first chair. Always second. There was one girl who always beat me.  It really demoralized me, because I wanted to do well. I ended up.being sure I had no ear, no talent, and eventually dropped out of orchestra (amongst other things like developing stage fright.)

Hindsight: (1) she was a year older than me. She started cello very young. She played multiple instruments. We weren't comparing two people at the same education level. That was, again, like comparing a high school essay to a college level essay and discouraging the high schooler because they weren't there yet. (2) her mom was literally my cello tutor. She grew up hearing cello, watching cello. In my family, I was the odd artist. My parents didn't do music or art or any of it. My talent actually was the ""naturally inclined"" - but again,  I stunted my confidence by comparing it to people who just had more experience.

... I occassionally play still, and by most people's standards I am very good. To me, it will never be enough.  It is because ai have always compared myself to someone else. I won't be ""good"" until yo-yo-ma himself says he admires me. There was a time I could have considered majoring in music, but I wasn't already a professional,  so I couldn't pursue it as a career. I still have low confidence about it, even when I can step back logically. 

I know this mindset has held me back so many times.

You don't know their whole story, and if you did - chances are you would feel much better about where you are.  And if they had a harder struggle, let it feed an inspiration to work harder. They had to struggle to get there.

Honestly, if you aren't using it, it won't stick. Just like learning a foreign language.  

[Long explanation that says the same as the above with more words]

I am regularly criticized for speaking above people's head, and I just don't catch it. I grew up in a family that spoke like this, it's almost like an accent. I had a social event where I invited a friend to a game night [D&D, so not language based like others I will mention.] with my cousins, and he stopped me in the middle asking me if we just had dictionaries we were pulling these words out of. I don't mean that to sound pretentious, because it has followed me with labels of ""stuck up"" and other assumptions simply due to my natural word choice.  (And heck,  I am too lazy to proofread this, so there is a 100%* chance you will find sloppy grammar or autocorrect errors throught this post) ... but my point is, if you put yourself around people that naturally speak that way, you will pick it up far more naturally than if you try to memorize the dictionary. ... my friend had no chance. One cousin is currently pursuing a PHD in technical writing. My husband has a master's in biological anthropology,  and the rest of the group was exactly the type of people you would expect to hang out with those two. [Except me, the college dropout, but they have to invite me as I am married to one and blood related to half of the group]

If you do want to do the ""memorize the dictionary"" method. Here are some tricks: listen as much as you read. Listen to college lectures or debates amongst scientists on podcasts. Often you will read a word, understand a word, but not pronounce it right - and that does not help you.  Also, games are more fun. I recomend Balderdash, although most of the words are not commonly used - a surprising volume tends to just be more niche words. (My family did New York Times crosswords, scrabble, Balderdash, and Gin rummy during family get togethers. Kids were as involved as the adults, with the exception of those gold colored drinks they had when Rummy was played. Eventually games like Taboo were also introduced,  which doesn't directly use big vocabulary words, but having a large vocabulary helps you cheat the system.) Also look at things for like SAT or GRE prep for vocabulary.  Those will focus in on less frequently used words that are very relevant. 

I also encourage practicing blending in definitions with your language for two reasons (1) training your understanding of the word. And (2) bridging the gap when you do end up having a larger vocabulary. It doesn't have to come off condescending or academic, and can be as simple as throwing in a synonym.  For example, if I said ""I feel like such a plebeian."" Many people are unfamiliar with the plebeians/bourgeois terms, and will not nessisarily understand the meaning. I could be super condescending and assume that the person on the other side does not know and say ""I feel like such a plebeian- that is, a person of lower economic and social status who suffers under the weight of the upper class.""  ... and I am likely to get a giant eye roll. I could also say (and I am sure there are people who can say this better than me, if you haven't noticed I tend to talk too much) ""Ugh, I have been spoiled by having fast internet. This dial up is making me feel like such a plebeian! First world problems I guess."" So there are context clues for people to follow, even if they don't have the vocabulary range. In relation to that, watch for eyes glazing over. If you are being stared at like the professor of calculus, it may be time to chill out, and let someone else talk for awhile.  ... chances are if you are looking to expand your vocabulary,  you are the type of person who already has an above average one and just want to push it further, so learning to relate while utilizing that skill is important.  (Of course, it also requires you realizing when you are using obscure words... which is not a skill I always have. Longanimity [Balderdash-style definition: Patiently suffering while plotting revenge.] was a word I was using in elementary - how difficult can that be? Oh, autocorrect doesnt know it, probably obsucre.)

A lot of people seem to go with feminism means that women can be ""the man"" and the goal is to erradicate the female gender roles. Often it looses view of the value of the ""female role"". The ideal feminism isnt just about women. It's about men too, and people who dont align with traditional gender roles. The ideal world - men don't get ridiculed when the best answer is them to stay home with the kids. It is a valued role, that is needed whether mom does it, the dad does it, Grandma does it, uncle Joe does it, or you pay a nanny/daycare/babysitter.  Same with going out and ""bringing home the bacon"". Different setup work better for different individuals and limiting it on sex alone is not helpful. ... but devaluing the ""traditional female role"" is just as dangerous as saying that all women ""should"" be in those roles.  
 
... just because your choices seem to currently align with historical roles doesn't mean you are betraying anything. Your attitude, your words, your view, and the way you live your life will have a far greater impact on that.

[Anecdotal insert: in reverse, going the opposite direction isn't nessisarily feminism.  My mom has a well paying career, that my dad couldn't match her part time income even working 60 hrs a week. The result was he worked around her schedule,  and was a lot more involved in child rearing than his dad was. He came from a household where his mom also had a full time job. My mom came from a household where her mom was the most consistent income.  You would think all 3 would show great feminism?  Yes and no. The most traditional marriage I have ever seen was my dad's parents, inspite of my Grandmother's career. My dad constantly grades himself as a ""lesser"" man because he wasnt the breadwinner. My mother's parents have so many of those classic ""locked into marriage"" type stories, you know they were ruled by the social structures around men and women. Each generation it gets a bit better. My little sister's husband is a stay at home dad, and she defends his choices regularly  (against many, but one of note is my more traditional parents- who think the roles should be reversed or they at least both should be working). I am in a relationship that is extraordinarily free/open on those kind of roles, and we talk about them. Yet in both, we still have our own playing to it. My husband occassionally has felt guilty for not making more money, even though he recently has been making more than me, and we are very comfortable. My sister often will play a more submissive role to her husband than I ever expected of her, mostly when protecting his ego and letting him ""be the man"".  ... even if you insisted on working, we all have this culture ingrained that we would be working around. Learn, grow, and do what is right for you.]"

They are talking about going online for a few weeks, but he mentions 30% of his students dont have internet at home (maybe cellular internet but not full workstation computers). He is frustrated,  because those 30%, on average, are also the ones who struggle the most, and they will be the most hurt by that decision.

konmari,fk6d51t,t3_fgkaod,1583899009.0,"There is a cost of owning things.

Some are obvious - a car needs to be licensed, insured, gas, repairs... these costs can mean buying a new (er) car saves you money, and letting go of an old frustrating one a budget-friendly choice.

But even smaller things have that....

When you move, it costs money to move everything. Even one across down where you throw things in garbage bags and drive it over yourself.  More trips, more gas. More trips, more time. Time is money. Is the $1 tape worth moving?

Storage costs money, this is obvious if you need a storage unit, or a bigger home... but even without that. Too much food in the fridge makes it harder to keep food from perishing.  Too much in a junk drawer makes it more likely that you go out and buy a second of what you ""need"" because you cannot find it. Things cost money to repair. Difficulty accessing things increases the likelyhood of them getting grimy, and maybe unusable.

My example on this is extreme. My dad is a hoarder. He loves to buy clearance items, pick up things on the side of the road, auctions, etc. He gets many incredible deals for pennies on the dollar. Yet he often spends more at the end of the day at his DIY budget solution than I did when I just called a professional, and had it done at a fair price. He hoards because he ""might need it"" for his next project. 

Some things I keep because I know I will need them. But if I haven't used it in years... If it requires work and money to make it useful again... often it is better to let it go even from a budget POV.

Maybe a ""I am going to America"" breaking of news. ... or maybe she has a burst of honesty. ""Ren, I like you, but I cannot go there. I cannot be that person."". I dont expect a full confession,  but she isnt a liar, she is honest to a fault. I dont think she will tell him she doesn't like him.

Paparazzi catching them as the door opens. Second scandal for Ren, potentially ruining for Kyoko, they are forced apart without her saying much and have to wait until it dies down.

So many people associate them with being constrained or uncomfortable formal situations... but I cannot tell you how often people have commented one being so dressed up (say for an early AM meeting) and my honest response (which I will say depending on the situation) ""Thanks! It was as close to wearing my pajamas as I could get""

... a cotton dress, some soft cute flats or sandals - pair with a sweater, and you can feel like you are in your pajamas with your comfort blanket and look like you really wanted to make an impression. 

Now I still wear a bra, and I am likely to put on heels. Instead of a sweater I will usually do a blazer or otherwise more structured jacket (but my most coY option is a shawl)... but if you have the build to get away with it, a sweater could conceal a ... lack of support ... and some flats are almost slippers but can still look professional/dressy.

Tips: leg shaving is annoying, but less annoying than tights. Having some structure in the dress does make it look more professional,  but in our culture wearing a dress at all tends to be ""dreased up"" so you can get away with a bit more unconstructed. If it is looking too casual, bump up the jacket (some blazers are really soft) and throw on some accessories (long necklaces can instantly take a shift dress from pajamas to dressy). Having good undergarments make everything better. I would rather have a $85 bra that fits, supports well, and makes everything look better with a $5 shirt. It honestly looks better than the reverse when I spend $20 on a bra (that sucks and I feel uncomfortable in) then $70 on a ""nice shirt"" but I look frumpy because things aren't supported right. Same with underwear,  I look nicer and feel more comfortable in very ""supportive"" $30 underwear and $25 jeans than I did in my  $2 underwear and my $53 jeans. You said you wouldn't wear a bra, so I am assuming you have the figure to get away with it, but you may find an under tank (the stretchy kind that has a bit of ""make sure everything stays where it is supposed to"" type structure) to make a difference in the final look without feeling horrible, but also getting a bra that is well fitted is a million times more comfortable and most women don't wear the right size.. finally, the one I hate ... hair and makeup.  It is impossible to look put together with bed head and tired eyes even in the best attire- but a sleek finish can make ""street fashion"" (which honestly is often horrible clothing) look put together."
Career,fk3mtu3,t3_fg01rz,1583840076.0,"You are not alone.

MOST people figure it out by making mistake and ending up somewhere they didnt really plan. (Example: my computer engineering degree ended up with me pursing management. Never what I expected of myself even a few years ago, and I never expected me to say ... I really enjoy it.)  My advice: worry less about getting it perfect, and just go with what is working. Maybe teaching is a bad move, or maybe being inexperienced is painful and you just need practice to love it. (Teaching is @&$(king scary) if you love working with kids - early education may not be a bad degree, but maybe it turns into something else down the line. Maybe you end up working for different emphasis that results in less traditional teaching? 

I know I HATE being incompetent or put on the spot. But some of the best rewards have been when I pushed through until they weren't bad anymore. ... and often it got way worse before it got better. I started out with zero stage fright. I could perform in front of anyone. Then I had a small talent show go slightly wrong. Then a solo (cello) judging go slightly wrong. I had an audition fail, but without bravado. Then a solo judging going moderately wrong. Then in a third attempt it went horrendously wrong. Each time it got worse, eventually I got sick and couldn't get on stage at all. I swore off performing. A decade later I am slowly stepping back into spotlight situations (like teaching) and it is starting to get better. The anxiety is lessening. The weight of the past mistakes don't feel as heavy. I actually recorded myself playing the cello, and played in front of my husband without shaking or feeling nauseous. I needed a break from the spotlight to do it again - but it didnt mean I couldn't do it.

... what I don't recomend- allowing yourself to change majors every 2 years. Sometimes it is better to push through and have something to show for your work and come back later if needed. So many jobs now will take a ""good argument for why your degree qualifies."" My biggest regret in education is how many times I switched, time and money wasted. (There ARE benefits, but it came are a big cost.) If I could do it again, I would have picked a major that I enjoyed learning and just do the 4 years, worry about ""the job"" later.

For example... my husband has used his anthropology degree to teach (currently is the chemistry teach in a highscool), work at museums,  and do forensics. He has also considered using it to work at a mortuary- and of course, traditional Anthropology.  [He is a prime example of a liberal arts degree getting put to use... but he also fights for it every job - proving his experience,  proving his value. He took extra opportunities too that he can really talk to, like doing an internship in Romania. It isn't easy for him to put it to use, but he does, and it has worked well for him.]

Since leaving school I have used my degree more for getting into jobs that want tech-competency more than any of the skills I learned in school. The biggest value from my college education was the ""college education"" (meaning enculturing into the corporate world and how ""the system"" works.) And there is real value there. My dad used his degree in accounting as a hobby and pursued jobs in manufacturing. My list of people who used their degree for what the intended is very, very short. (And most are highly specialized and mostly medical. Like my mother who is a pharmacist. )

Don't worry about getting it perfect now. You will get it. It sometimes just takes experience and putting yourself out there. If you like learning education it sounds like you are well into your degree. Something is right - push forward!"

Any job isnt just looking for a qualified candidate, but also one that will mesh well with the team (a huge part of hidden discriminations, but that is another topic.) Also depending on what you are looking at doing, expressing enthusiasm can make a huge difference in your actual execution. This is where that ""could it be an excuse"" comes in. It may be read as a ""We doubt your ability to mesh with the team"" - but that is one scenario. 

My job is in customer service. Not everyone hired is a bubbly big personality love-people kind of person... but we have a higher percentage of them.than the average population for sure. There is actual job-skill related.  Who is going to hop in front of the counter and help the customers first - we want them. Who is going to look for solutions when a customer is being a Karen and turn their attitude around - we want them. Who is going to be able to be on their feet for 8+ hrs and still smiling and laughing - we want them. Someone who comes into the interview and has some technical skill and experience might not be selected if they seem too withdrawn or low energy. It takes 3 months before you even start being useful, and ingesting in someone who doesn't click is a risky move. Someone who seems like they need a job, is willing to work, but doesn't want to fight for a career - they often quit before those 3 months are over. (My job looks entry level, but the people who stay are people who want to move up into management or make a career out of it - people looking for a ""job"" can find an easier one for the same pay and usually do.)  

I almost didn't get my job when I first started for that reason. My efforts to be professional came across as withdrawn. My awkwardness at the interview made them doubt my longevity, and to be fair - I didn't know what I was applying for, so bad on me.  But my technical skills caused the assistant manager to push for me against the other candidates and they gave me a chance. I learned a lot and now come across with much more passion - but even then, my lack of ""hunger"" holds me back a lot. Do I want a promotion? ""Well yes, but I am not 100% so I'm not fighting for it."" - Means I don't get it. The moment I am ready to fight for it, I will get it, and I know it. The fight is exactly the skill they are waiting for me to develop.

Tip: Practice arrogance. Most of us are awkward with self-promotion.  It feels yucky, and we know our weaknesses too well. If you go in with ""integrity"" (translation: being honest about your flaws and providing them without prompting) you will often come across as not really wanting the job, and convincing them they don't want you. If you go in with ""modesty"" (translation: not bragging up little things) then you will come across as lacking enthusiasm. Pretend you are in 3rd grade and you get an award for everything. Brag about every ""award"". Play up team efforts as something you had a big part in. They are bigger than you think, what is easy for you and ""not a big deal"" are often the things that make you good at your job. If it seems silly to brag about them, brag anyway.

Fantasizing obsessively,  definitely should seek help.

A passing ""dark side of the brain"" thought - normal, inspite of what the above people said. https://www.headspace.com/blog/2015/07/17/should-i-fear-the-dark-side-of-the-mind/

We all have dark thoughts, but judging how real we actually engage with them is another matter. For myself?  I have thought about it. Something about the ""perfect crime"" serial killer thing can be strangely fascinating.  Look how many TV shows we have on that. But if it came down to it, I couldn't pick someone to do it to. The reality lurches my emotions. I am one of the least violent people I know (never owned a gun, am not prone to physical responses - a sarcastic jab is my most likely weapon) 

Please, if you are seriously engaging with these thoughts,  get help. For your sake and others."
TooAfraidToAsk,fin3097,t1_fim5pec,1582554518.0,"That could easily happen at my job, which is a very large company. We have one of the better insurances, and part timers get it too. The lower paid people I have seen recently are around $15/hr. So at 20 hrs a week that is roughly $1,300/month. Make a few dollars less, work a few hrs less, and you are definitely able to have good insurance and make that much. (Note: I live in an area with a higher cost of living. I am willing to bet many areas pay rate is much less also.)"
TooAfraidToAsk,fin2knb,t3_f8ibt1,1582554205.0,".... sort-of ...

I have insurance that pays for some mental health.

I can do an online therapist 100% covered through one program. But it has to be online.

I can get 6 visits a year within a narrow network (not many will take my insurance) that brings it down to about $25 a visit. Most therapists want to see you more often than once every 2 months though. I think my insurance will cover a percentage of ones after that, but it is something like 20%

... so with insurance I could, but I have to fight through the bureaucracy,  and it took me 30+ phone calls to confirm a doctor (mostly a cycle of calling my insurance, getting a list of doctors, calling the doctors, each saying they won't take my insurance, then calling back my insurance. Rinse and repeat.) I could go to. Is can only imagine a therapist would be harder. I know a coworker who struggled through it, and it was a giant mess."

Foodforthought,fi7jzf6,t1_fi7d5sa,1582222825.0,"This is very true, and I have to admit I have been at that advantage from my own family. ... my family isnt ""rich"" as in long international vacations and beach homes and sports cars. But my parents saved lots, invested a little, and made good enough income to not have to worry about paying rent.

When I got to college, my parents were able to hand me a saving fund that lasted me 4 years ... I worked during that time and had scholarships,  but that money was a huge deal.

When I got into a financial struggle in my mid 20s, my parents dropped $2,000 so I could pay my bills, buy food, and have a bit of a buffer to catch up.

When my sister got married and had a kid, but lives dramatically under the poverty  line... her baby still has a safe carseat, medical bills are paid, food is managed. They don't have enough to pull her out of poverty,  but they have enough to shield their granddaughter from some of the impacts.

In the case of genes, my sister has Asperger's- her life will always be a little harder because she struggles to play social games. My family was able to get her early treatment, and most people see her as quirky/odd and she can hold down a job. It is rare to see her get so overwhelmed that she reverts into the rocking or self-injury to soothe, because she has had the opportunity to have support from early on. In another family she may have never got the support she needed to be able to do what she has done. 

I always get to have that security blanket. ""Yes I am going to work hard. Yes I will do this myself and be independent. ... but ... if it all falls apart ... things will be okay."" It has allowed me to take risks I wouldn't have otherwise been able to take. It has reduced stress when crisis hit.

I compare this to my husband. He grew up very poor, and fought his way out. He doesn't trust when money is low - he stops eating which puts his health at risks and lowers his ability to manage it. He isn't willing to take risks. I am struggling with encouraging him to do house shopping with me - it is timez we are settled in one place, a mortgage would be cheaper than rent, and we can afford a good down payment. ... but he is terrified of getting a loan and having the worst hit. He lost his house as a kid.

We had very parallel lives in many ways. (We grew up in the same area, had the same education - many of the same teachers, were viewed by our peers similarly,  our parents were from similar education levels)... I had a financially stable home, he had a financially hectic home. They way it sets us up to make money as adults is astounding. By all accounts he should make more money than me. He works harder, has a master's, provides a critical skill,  and is a white male. I am female,  have an associate's,  work a retail job. All statistics say I should make less... but I have always made significantly more than him. I play the money game better, it is less scary. I see investment where he sees risks. ... and a lot of that is the glass floor. If I am wrong, we wont starve, we won't die we wont be homeless. He sees homelessness as a real fear, those risks aren't worth that."

I was about 7 (so forgivable for some stupidity) and my parents were gone on the first no-kid trip since my little sister was born. (... you know already I still hear about this every Christmas...)

I was told: no playing in the truck.

The babysitter was told: no playing in the truck.

So I was playing in the truck.

I was inside the bed, and I decided to open the back side to get out easier instead of climbing over the side. 

Flipping over the back as it opened, headfirst into the pavement was definitely faster. Success!

DMAcademy,fhpds8g,t3_f40udv,1581787302.0,"It really depends on the DM. It sounds like you handle it well, but it is all how you olay them.

If they are getting killing blows or major damage on enemies... you might be overdoing it.

If they are saving your player's characters on a regular basis you may need to tone down the monsters. The DMPC shouldn't be the fail safe (often... I am not opposed to the rare saving).

If they are trying to be center of attention in everything, it will be hard for.other players to shine. You already play all the monsters and regular NPCs... having a DMPC can turn into ""DM universe""

The DMPC is a bad way to railroad/direct players, if you need to do it try other methods. Players will look to the DMPC for that, so making them extra clueless or worthless at metagaming might be important.

.... but I have seen it turn out super well too. Someone who adds a bit of lore, or would make sense to come along. 

One example of DMPC in the dungeon crawl is my DM is doing Dungeon of the Mad Mage, which is a heavy dungeon crawl (even with interesting lore) he is implementing Halaster at higher levels to torture us, mess with us, play with us ... ""help"" us. I am 98% sure he is much heavier handed on Halaster than the module suggests (I have not read it to be sure, for obvious reasons). He isnt there 100% of the time, popping in and out, but he is using it to break up the drudgery and add extra RP - and we have been having a ton of fun with it. Halaster is our favorite. Right until he kills us probably."

....

""I want to make sure I honor your best experience in this game. There are some unintended conflicts between some of the character designs and I want to make sure no one is shorted. Please tell me more about what is important to you about your character. ""


This phrase gives no direct hint about what the conflict is. Based on how they answer you can have relevant follow up questions...

""What if the resolution to your identity ended up being more comical rather than dramatic, would that hurt your experience?""

""How important is originality vs exploring the idea of having to hide your race?""

... then mix in some things that are relevant to the characters but maybe not relevant to this conflict for some misdirection (but also great as a DM to help build character backstory)

""So what part of this sentimental memory is important? Is it the loss or how the character grew?"" 

.... .... ....

Not only does this help characters develop, it also helps you decide what works best for the players.
