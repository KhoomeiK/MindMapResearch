She knows sheâ€™s in a corner and doesnâ€™t want to lose her job. Sheâ€™s taking advantage of your kindness. I have Generalized Anxiety
Disorder. Iâ€™m familiar with anxiety and what it can do to you. I have zero sympathy for her. She humiliated you twice in that meeting. First for bringing up your chest in a work setting in front of multiple coworkers. That alone should have resulted in bringing HR in. Secondly, (I get the impression your a normally composed person) she made you lose your shit in front of your coworkers.   I say leave your complaint with HR and let them decide. If this isnâ€™t handled properly, whoâ€™s to say sheâ€™s not going to be trouble in the future."
TrueOffMyChest,fmwbqv9,t3_fxhj0h,1586443623.0,"We had a similar situation when I was in High School.  The Fall of our Junior year, a very popular kid in my class (super nice to everyone) was tragically killed in a car accident. It floored the entire school. His Memorial was in one of our biggest churches. It was packed. There were so many people from our community there. I remember there being a ton of news coverage on the accident. There were two pages dedicated to him in our year book that year. Fast forward to our Senior year, a guy that I went all the way through school with, committed suicide. He was not one of the popular kids, so there was barely a blip about it. His friends were the only ones that seemed effected by it. So for our yearbook that year, they were nice enough to put a page dedicated to him, but they also chose to put an additional dedication to the guy that died the year before. The guy that committed suicide wasnâ€™t worthy enough to get the whole 2 pages."
AmItheAsshole,flnmhxe,t3_fpv21h,1585321677.0,NTA  I have a variety of mental health issues and I lost my job over it. I was a teacher in my third (tenure year).  I confided my health issues to the wrong people. I was in no way a danger to my kids and I had an exemplary record. That didnâ€™t matter. My principal and superintendent worked together and found a weak ass reason to force me to resign. The Union couldnâ€™t do anything because I wasnâ€™t tenured. I donâ€™t recommend anyone revealing any medical information unless itâ€™s absolutely necessary (ie cancer). I highly recommend he take his diagnosis out of his resume.

PMDD,evtg7wf,t1_evqrhtc,1564769722.0,"Sorry for the delayed response. Iâ€™ve been feeling pretty shitty. So I have a long list of meds Iâ€™ve been on. So back in 2015 I was admitted to a psych unit twice in one summer for out of control PMDD. I was suicidal til I got my period and then it went away. I was also suffering postpartum really bad. I also have bipolar disorder, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, ocpd, adhd and the list goes on. Anyway my gyno put me on mononessa (a generic for Ortho-Cyclen). I took it continuously for about a year and a half. It kept my period and PMDD away. Eventually when I was feeling better mentally I stopped taking it. Also for the psych meds Iâ€™m on quite a bit. After the first hospitalization in â€˜15 they put me on lithium.   Now I only have PMDD symptoms when my mental health has taken a dive."

PMDD,evp06s6,t3_cki7id,1564662913.0,"It sounds like PMDD to me. In addition to psych meds, I was also on a continual birth control pill for a long time to keep me from getting my period. When itâ€™s really out of control I get suicidal with my periods. Now, as long as my other mental health issues are under control, I just have normal pms. Iâ€™ve actually had two PMDD episodes since Spring.  These are the first ones Iâ€™ve had since 2015.  I agree with the above poster. Iâ€™d get with some medical professionals that know about PMDD and how to properly treat it. Being mindful about it alone isnâ€™t much help."

Iâ€™ve learned that if you catch the episode in the first few days and fight like hell the episode may not get as bad. Iâ€™ve found the longer you spiral, the longer and deeper the depression can be. The longest stretch I went was about 2 years. It was one of the darkest periods of my life. I should also mention that I have other mental health issues. Once one is triggered, if not managed, the others will follow suit. I wish you the best. Keep fighting the good fight!"
