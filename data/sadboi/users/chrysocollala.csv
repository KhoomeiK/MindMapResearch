I can be as depressed as I want and he doesn’t judge or take it personally. I think the biggest thing that’s changed is that I stopped feeling guilty. *I feel how I feel and they feel how they feel.* If I want to help them I can but I don’t let myself do it at the expense of my own needs and sense of safety. If you want to be alone, turn your phone off and block everyone and just take time to be alone. They will forgive you. If they’re putting pressure on you hurry up and stop being depressed so they can feel better it’s manipulation and it’s not healthy, if they care about you feeling better then do what you need to do to feel better, tell them you are alive and safe, but don’t feel guilty and don’t let anyone make you feel guilty."

AskAstrologers,fltu4a5,t3_fqyx4l,1585487280.0,So I looked up your noon chart and you do have lots of scorpio but you also have a square with your saturn in aquarius. What can happen with squares is that people can favor one side. Especially since you have jupiter trine your saturn I think you are favoring your libra/aquarius side and either neglecting or projecting your scorpio side. Maybe you have some intense family members or some other aspect of your life where you live out your scorpio parts. It could also come up as occasional bad luck or a hidden part of your subconscious. It would depend what house it’s in. Based on your description of yourself I would guess that you’re an aquarius rising or maybe libra.

Moon in the ninth house, your emotional side may live on the opposite side of life from your sexuality and you may find happiness and understanding through higher learning, philosophy, travel and foreign cultures. The moon also represents the mother so your mother might come from a foreign country or know foreign languages or be a college professor.

Saturn in the second house, you may struggle to make ends meet especially before the age of thirty. Saturn will return to aquarius within the next few years which will be a particularly hard time in regards to money and, since it’s in aquarius, you will probably feel alone, like you don’t have a friend to turn to.
