selfharm,fqdm5ah,t1_fqcmd0k,1589292498.0,"Please don't be alarmed, it depends on a few things really. Obviously people use ice for a number of different reasons, including to treat injuries. When using Ice instead of sh, many times the temperature change is enough to satisfy the urge. But ice can and does cause pain if applied directly to the skin, especially for an extended length of time. And it can cause tissue damage if left on for too long (I've gotten mild frostbite before). In that instance, yes, it would be considered self harm by many because you are causing yourself pain. If it's not causing you pain, which it seems like it doesn't, then I (personally) wouldn't consider it any different than icing an injury. However, it's totally possible that your definition of sh is different than mine, which is totally okay!!!!!"
selfharm,fqa7c9c,t1_fqa0zph,1589214106.0,"Ice is technically self harm. BUT it's a form of risk/harm reduction. If you've gotta do something, it's way better to use ice than to draw blood."
selfharm,fp22twz,t3_gaj0n9,1588253990.0,"I am so sorry to hear about the loss of your cat. That's always difficult, but especially now. I am so happy that you found some relief from exercising!! It's a good burn, and while you won't see immediate results you will if you play the long game. Hang in there!"

selfharm,fon5q5e,t1_fon2lgl,1587912818.0,Yes the holding ice is one of the DBT crisis skills!! I use it all the time. It's a great distraction and there aren't lasting consequences since it's very hard to hold ice long enough that you'll get frostbite.
selfharm,fon5jzh,t3_g878j2,1587912711.0,"A year is amazing!! Don't discount all of that effort because you started again at a time when the world is going to shit.

As my therapist explained to me, basically every contract ever has an ""act of God"" clause where in the case of disease, natural disasters, or uprising against the government they are allowed to not honor the contract. You made a contract with yourself to not SH and stuck to it for a year (A YEAR!!!!) - that's 365 days clean. Allow yourself an ""act of God clause"" in your recovery where you forgive yourself for slipping right now!! It might take awhile to find that forgiveness for yourself, but if you can be clean for a year I know you can do it."

selfharm,fk1kzdh,t3_fftl3h,1583781785.0,"Hi! While self harm is never good, it's important to realize how much stigma there is around it. I am forever grateful to my therapist for her ""harm reduction"" mentality. I've been self harming on and off for years, and she never once shamed me for it or told me it was wrong. It was always a coping mechanism to deal with a bigger issue that I was working through.  To be perfectly honest, self harm kept me alive. My therapist and I worked on ways to reduce the risk of infection like using a fresh blade each time, sanitizing the area before and after, and what areas it was safer to SH in than others."

CPTSD,f8fxyp0,t3_e0oeg4,1574551095.0,"There is no invalid reason to have CPTSD. People perceive things differently, and if it was traumatic for you then it's valid, full stop.

Hoarding in particular comes with its own set of mental challenges both for the hoarder and those who live with them. My mom is a hoarder and I'm still (literally and figuratively) digging out from all the shit."

ptsd,f80nr8p,t1_f80lb8b,1574133518.0,"cPTSD stands for complex PTSD, which usually occurs from many ""smaller"" traumas (like being raised by a narcissistic parent, or being in an abusive relationship) which occur over a period of time and is not from one defined ""event"". I say ""smaller"" not to minimize their effect but rather to help differentiate. Traditional PTSD is usually caused by a major event like a military battle, car accident, or rape. Both can have the same symptoms, but since the causes are different the treatments can differ wildly. cPTSD is a relatively new concept. All of that being said, I've personally found both subs to be helpful."
selfharm,f7mnrhc,t3_dwn8aj,1573868439.0,"I'm so glad you have someone like that in your life!! The not (outwardly) showing shock or anger or anything but support is so important. This summer I called a close friend one evening to ask him to help me throw away my blades. This was the first time I had ever told him about my SH and he just talked to me about random things while he was driving over to my place. He stayed for almost three hours and even though I know I scared the ever-loving shit out of him he never once during that time showed it or made me feel anything but loved. That is in stark contrast to when I first told my now ex husband and he freaked out and said I was disgusting - I never confided in him again.

It sounds like you are already a pretty solid listener but hopefully you can pay it forward if another friend confides in you about their SH one day."

selfharm,f4c5n78,t3_dk8oio,1571524216.0,My mom said the same to me. 15 years later I am still dealing with the same emotional issues I was then. Your feelings and emotions are valid.
