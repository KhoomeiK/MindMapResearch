selfharm,fjhlimf,t3_fdgi3d,1583350444.0,"the biggest positive thing to come out of it was just getting it off my chest after so long. the therapists i’ve had in the past always knew about it from my hospital records, and when they asked i always told them that i used to, but don’t anymore (total lie). when i started seeing the therapist i have now, i told him the same thing, but he didn’t believe me. even though he knew i was lying, he never pushed it. he let me talk about it in my own time, when i felt like i was ready to. when i finally did, it was so freeing. knowing that i have someone that i can talk to about it now, who doesn’t get angry or upset or disappointed with me, has to be the other biggest positive. 

as for negatives, it is still really difficult to admit when i relapse. i’m always scared that i’m going to let him down or disappoint him, even though he never reacts that way. he asks how much, how bad, and if i’m okay, and if i want to talk about it further we do, if not, we move on. having a therapist that doesn’t pry, and doesn’t make you talk about things you’re not ready to talk about is such a blessing. this is kind of off topic but to anyone who is struggling to find a therapist they feel comfortable with, it may take time but you will find someone. i’ve seen so many therapists, and up until the one i have now, they were all female (as am i) but i went out of a whim and decided to try a male therapist, and it was the best decision for me to make because i’ve never felt more comfortable with a therapist before. don’t give up💙"

It seems impossible for them to understand that honestly, i just don’t have the energy or desire to do so. a relationship sounds nice, but when it comes down to it, i just don’t know if i’m capable of it right now, and i kind of don’t care at the same time. i have my whole life to be in relationships so i’m fine with not being in one right now."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ev13qpn,t3_chvwud,1564151745.0,"something similar happened to me recently! i was talking to a co-worker and she was talking about how no one ever remembers when her birthday is. without thinking i blurted out a date, and sure enough, it was her birthday. i thought she was just messing with me but she pulled out her license to show me and i was spot on.

this co-worker is relatively new and the only time i’ve talked to her was when she asked if i could cover her shift, so there’s no way i would’ve known it."
AmItheAsshole,esk4hul,t3_c7ugvf,1562051066.0,"UPDATE***

i ended up going to get a car wash and paying for it myself. it had already been on my car overnight and i wasn’t going to try and wait to win an argument to go get it cleaned. 

people have suggested to tell her i won’t be giving her anymore rides. although i can see where that would be fair,  personally that makes me feel guilty and i don’t want her to drive or get in someone’s car that she doesn’t know because i’m upset by things from the past. 


i texted her afterwards telling her that i was paying for it myself, but an apology for doing it in the first place would be nice. i ended it with saying - “if you really need a ride and no one else is answering, call me. but unless i’m like the last option and you can’t call anyone else, please don’t ask for rides. 

...she sent me back an “ok” 

also, people have mentioned that this is a weird hill to die on, and although that’s true, this isn’t the only thing that’s happened. there are many other things leading up to now where she’s been rude/inconsiderate/blaming others for her problems/wrongdoings"
AmItheAsshole,eshp5ej,t1_eshp0p7,1561998202.0,"Exactly. I don’t care about the car wash, i care about my car being clean and i don’t think i should have to clean her puke off myself"

AskReddit,ernvq9w,t3_c2v84d,1561062168.0,"psychiatric hospitals... i’ve been in several. they’re not scary in the ways that movies make them out to be, (at least not the ones i’ve been at) in fact, i’ve met some of the kindest people while being inpatient. 

what makes the nighttime scary is that people will scream bloody murder in their sleep from having nightmares about their trauma. waking up to screams almost every night is super unsettling and scary."
