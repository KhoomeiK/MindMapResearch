Rivenmains,fkchrw9,t3_fhg9b4,1584053349.0,I was having some troubles choosing my items but now I think that I have found my go to build every game. Although my wr isn't that great is because of my teammates. I most of the times win my lane but the fed mid and fed adc just completely obliterate my advantage and I don't know what to do. Maybe my macro game is lacking some fundamentals

But I don't understand riot, they were really mad because you coul run X champ in the jungle arguing that ""it's not the role we want for the champ"" ex. Camille, Sylas they got completely gutted but now they are like ""look we are making a lot of useless picks viable junglers (play my game pls)"""

Yoshihiro Togashi, mangaka of Hunter x Hunter, said that he used Egyptian gods for reference to name the three royal guards of Meruem.

You should watch an interview of some of them, I recommend you to watch the interview of Hiroyuki Takei.

In addition to Hunter x Hunter you can say that is the manga with the longest hiatus in history"
