WritingPrompts,fl3wq87,t3_fm3ezl,1584800371.0,"I took the my last breath of air and jumped. It felt like a roller coaster, except I was going straight down. Strangely enough, i did not feel anything when my head hit the pavement floor.

What was more strange was that I am now just a soul detached from my body. I took some time standing beside my body, surveying the scene around me. People were screaming and horrified at the sight of my now inhuman body. An ambulance came and the nurses cleaned up the mess. Policemen scurried to cordon the area off. I then proceeded to climb the staircase which appeared in front of me. 

After what felt like hours, I finally reached the top. The words 'St. Peter's Gate' was etched boldly on the golden gate before me, and the man, which I assumed was St. Peter, seemed to be awaiting me.

'Hurry up lad! I've got other things to do!' Said the old man. He looked exactly what a holy old man would look like. He seemed impatient so i hurried over to him. He stared at me for a while and brought up this scanner like thing in a sci-fi movie.

He looked at the screen and cursed under his breath, 'Shit, looks like you have spent the same time doing good things as bad things. Ah fuck it, Jesus won't find out. Take the road to the left.' 

And that's about it, I'm in heaven now."
