PinkpillFeminism,fpzllw9,t3_ggc5jk,1589019917.0,The worst part about this is some of them describe their experiences with their boyfriends and I'm assuming they're still with them if they're not referring to their boyfriends as exes. This is not love but domination and abuse. I'm disgusted

BlackPillFeminism,fpr5a8f,t3_gf2aka,1588842903.0,I'm so sorry for your pain but I'm glad you found out before you got married. I only have a few years of dating experience but I'm slowly realizing men don't have the capacity for love on the same level women do. They're just void of empathy and I'm slowly learning to be strong on my own. My dream is just to be single for life and date men on a short term basis if I feel like it (but I'm slowly feeling more and more disgust for them.)

GenderCritical,fp5sxpm,t3_gbd6m5,1588339174.0,"I'm going through the same issue and I'm angry myself and SO MANY women have to harbour these fears because of the behaviour of men. I'm not gonna tell you to stop being angry or hating men like other people will because I'm in the same boat. 

But what my therapist said put things into perspective- She told me what I feel is valid and it's true that violence is gendered (just looking at the stats) but what is important is asking yourself if being in a constant state of anger or fear is good for you. (That energy can go into loving yoursf/finding hobbies) I'm in therapy for recovery- you might find that useful to process sexual assault while dealing with a new environment. What has helped me most is letting myself seek women-centric environments and finding a practice that lets me grow stronger surrounded by other women. Sending  love and I hope you find support ‚ù§Ô∏è"

In a world where men are often more powerful, they often don't do anything to protect women and often are the main perpetrators of violence."
ptsd,f9p7wqf,t3_e6c40x,1575524574.0,"For me, anything sensory that distracts me form the trigger often provides an immediate, temporary relief and distracts me for a while, which helps calm me down a bit.

For example, wrapping myself up in a soft blanket or smelling essential oils or drinking a hot drink.

My therapist also recommended deep breathing, which helps but I find that when I'm triggered, I need to do something that doesn't require thinking to counting."
relationship_advice,f99ecyt,t3_e40enz,1575190346.0,"Your feelings are entirely valid. As a fellow survivor, don't discount them. - This is the best way your brain knows how to protect yourself considering what you've been through.

It takes time and therapy to shift these thoughts but know that in your current state, it is ok to feel this way. I told my therapist about how I constantly think ""all men are out to hurt me"" and I feel slighted when people say ""not all men"". In reality, violence like rape or abuse is a gendered phenomenon. I knew I found the right therapist when she said she completely agreed violence is gendered. Instead of telling me not all men are out to get me, she taught me to shift my thinking to ""Some men are bad. Some are good. I trust my intuition and boundaries in helping me navigate who to trust."" So grateful to her for this!"
ptsd,f6ofd0d,t3_ds8aof,1573015941.0,"I've felt this for the longest time and still do but my therapist said something this week that I keep reminding myself. The fact that I show up for therapy and my medical appointments with the intention of trying to get better shows that 'I am in control of my life.' 

Keep reminding yourself that you are no longer in those situations and your awareness of how toxic those experiences are show that you're already growing. PTSD makes you feel helpless but know that you are in control as long as you're striving to make positive changes."

ptsd,f2ia5vs,t3_ddelml,1570254344.0,"Aimless sex/promiscuity can be a form of self-harm, albeit it being a more 'acceptable' form of self-harm compared to excessive drinking etc. Sex positivity is cool and all but I think it's important to be aware of your motivations behind your actions. I've done the whole casual sex thing and in hindsight, I think most of it was self-harm at times and a way to distract myself by having some form of company even if my partners added no value to my life."
ptsd,f22zpcu,t3_dbmdl6,1569901302.0,Trauma makes your brain work in weird ways. It's hard to explain to people who've never been through it but do not invalidate your pain. I had a doctor who just couldn't fathom how I could not remember the traumatic act till 6 months later (when I was in a different environment that was more safe and familiar to me). He kept insisting I must have been drunk etc. Block those people out and believe your bodily symptoms

blackladies,ex1w2sv,t3_cr51bf,1565957310.0,"I understand the feeling! I just graduated in July too from a UK uni. Honestly, I'm in the same boat except I'm on a student visa. The good thing about UK grad schemes is that you can apply for grad schemes even a year after you graduated and your degree does not necessarily determine your role (so you can be a major in psychology and still apply for a finance grad scheme etc). I would recommend talking to other people who are now working like alumni and doing more research on roles to make an informed decision. This will help you narrow your choices and focus on doing the applications well. If you need the money, take a part time job while applying for grad schemes. Also don't be hesitant to use your uni career services! They can help you get through the process and do it well"
Feminism,ewo1i5o,t3_co4dr3,1565601119.0,I did a paper on women's rights activism and shariah law in my undergraduate studies. Most people forget or are ignorant of the fact that shariah law was not practised as a rigid code of rules as it is in some countries today. (Shariah law in the past was often highly based on specific contexts and varied depending on judicial judgement)The institutions that enforce shariah law in a rigid and patriarchal manner today often use arguments of religion and 'tradition' to justify oppressive customs. I believe both can be complementary but it is hard to do so in today's context considering male figures dominate as key figures in leadership and academic positions.
