Edit: plus, that’s only desktop traffic that you’re showing desktop traffic, when stats show in 2016 40% of content views are driven by mobile."

UnsentLetters,fajomev,t1_faiolnu,1576148603.0,"YES. GO OP!!!

I was in an emotionally abusive relationship... and gosh it took me so long to name it. His friends and family were accusing me of being this and that, but once i named it “abuse”, I felt liberated! I know it’s not wise to compare experiences and suffering, and that’s not my intention here. 

Just know that I’m sitting on a bus reading your post and silently cheering for you like crazy inside my head as I read it!"

Explain why you still asked me out after getting with her, and the gruesome hour-long conversation you made me sit through when you talked enthusiastically about your sex life with her.

Explain showing your face to a place you’re sure I’d be at when you promised not to show up in front of me ever again. 

Explain talking abt this new girl to our mutual friends literally 1 foot behind me right after the breakup.

All I did was be nice to you with more than I could ever give.  To you, to your family, your mother, your sister.  Explain the emotional abuse you caused me.

You’re lucky I’m still living to comment. You cannot count how many times I was half an inch away from jumping out the building because of you.

P.s. wish you all the karma you deserve."
