Ultimately, I think it was either murder (which to me makes more sense after looking into it all) or unintentional suicide...so an accident I guess?

No there is no way to react, but after studying true crime for years, you pick up on things like people's behaviour. If you're interested in the case I highly recommend Stephanie Harlowe's videos, I'll link it below. I do plan to cover the case one day but it's a big one. I guess I'm also bitter because no other missing child in history has had as much media attention or money given to them. Yet the parents don't seem too thankful for it compared to others. They left her alone, as did the other parents. If that was in the UK, wouldn't they have faced child endangerment charges or something? They also left the apartment unlocked! It's a mistake they have to deal with.

I think she's dead and I think the father knows more than he lets on. I honestly hate him. His body language, his argumentative personality. He doesn't seem thankful at all that we are giving him millions to look for a kid then went missing because they left her unattended in another country. I'm so suppried they haven't been charged with anything just for leaving them alone. A stupid mistake that we are paying for. 

And as for the mother, she talks about Maddie's perfect genitals in her book wtf is all that about? She's just s stubborn as her husband. If they had bugged their house like they did Mick Philpott, I'm pretty sure some questionable stuff would have been said. 

But anyway, it's about Maddie. An innocent little girl who was left unsupervised with her siblings. She's never going to be found and we will never know what happened, unless a death bed confession comes out."
