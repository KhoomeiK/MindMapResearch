 Take it in guys, don't fight it. Let it exist. It wants to tell you something. You already said it, you need purpose. Stay positive. About yourself, about people, about future.

They clearly have some issues too, i wouldn't say they are bad people on purpose but they handled some situations pretty wrong and scared you emotionally to the point you don't know how you feel about certain situations. Nothing you did is embarrassing, it's ok to have feelings and needs. Don't think you aren't supposed to have those. They clearly don't understand that but i don't think they do it on purpose. Don't hold a grudge, it will only eat you from inside."
mentalhealth,fqbjyqk,t3_ghwhld,1589238395.0,"Why sad? i did it too when i was a kid and as a teenager. I think it only has to do with you not feeling secure as a kid. You had to build security for yourself and that's hard. You have been a father and mother to yourself for a long time. By becoming an actor you can do all those roles that you didn't have. Do you have a father and a mother figure? Which people you met in your life looked and felt like mother and father the most?

But i think a great wisdom comes from that. The situation maybe makes you sad but your life or you aren't sad. You can be happy and content with yourself too. It's not something that only the priviledged can have. 

Regarding the question about a personality disorder, there is no one here who is a doctor. I doubt you would benefit if someone answers that question. It could only make you worry more. I would recommend going to a psychiatrist and slowly talk about yourself and learn from them, they know what's happening in people's heads when they have traumas in their childhood. They see your mechanisms and know how you could get out of the loop. That's at least my opinion regarding doctors. They helped me immensely."

In last post you said that your girlfriend isn't going to kill herself, at least she said it like that. I think you should believe her. With all this worry you are doing way more damage to you. You said she doesn't want to talk about it since you brought it up a couple of times. Maybe try talking about your and her emotions and thoughts. That could calm her down, bond you two and that way she could feel more positive. 

You father wants good for you. He is harsh because fathers have to be like that. He wants to teach you how to be responsible. 

Focus on your work and do it as good as you can. That's what men do. Stand their ground and stand behind what they say. You picked this job, you said you are up for it. Do it till end now (if you can of course, if you can't then give up).

It's hard to look it that way but everyone wants to help, it's just in their own way and sometimes they get lost in a certain situation, they sidetrack and it seems like they wanted to hurt you on purpose.

What do you mean? Here on this subreddit? Well i think they don't listen because they are lost and scared. It's easy to get into that vortex.

What people should actually do is think about traumatic situations, think about your childhood and why are you today the way you are.

It's possibly really frustrating for a doctor to listen to that kind of stuff.

It's not details of your life that tell him something it's the mechanisms you use in your life. All mechanism are the same, in every person. They can try and guide you, advise behaviours that could be positive for you. 

I think it can be a trigger for people when you say i think you have that and he didn't even ask. Even if he did ask hey, what do you think is wrong with you. People should say, you want to know? Go to a psychiatrist!"

 What do you think how high is the probability that someone who is sharing a post on reddit subreddit goes to a psychiatrist?

I think people who are here are really desperate. Rarely do i see something thought provoking and out of heart. 

I saw yesterday a guy giving 5 ""solutions"" for which disorders it could be. If you have the illness you could spot some similarities and say, i do this thing too and i think it has to do with my disorder. I would approve that 100%. 

I think it happens a lot like saying too much, triggering people."

Insensitive? If i really am i can't do much about it. Maybe if you told me a little more. To some people i maybe am, for some just the contrary. I know i make some people very happy too. 

Why do you talk about abuse all the time? Why do you think about abuse so much? Since you said ""if you were an abuse victim..."", i concluded you aren't one. Why are you resonating so much with it? 

I just had a thought. Some people are really abused by people, physically and the suffer ptsd and or more problems and some people  think as an abused person even thought they weren't abused physically, but only psychologically. 

I would say i can resonate with that."

mentalhealth,fq6m9rv,t1_fq6dlrx,1589134260.0,"Finally i got a better reaction out of you. See, you did stand up for yourself when someone is abusive. Thank you for being honest.

What do you mean by confronting the situations that lead to negative thoughts? Would that for an abuse victim be fighting back? 

Ego dissolution? Detachment? I don't know if i'm saying that those are the solution.  I didn't use those words, i don't know what those mean actually. I'm talking about philosophy, being able to look at a situation through lots of perspectives, of course back those perspectives with something practical and finally getting to know yourself through all that. Learning what is good for you. Using everything around you as information and putting it together to learn about how you see the world. Blend that information into a vision of your world and learn how to bend that vision if necessary. 

What i'm saying, in your case. It's not about your abuse, it's about how you see that situation. You see it as abuse and nothing else. But try to find a perspective where for instance you are the abuser or it's just an attempt ob abuse, in the end you are the one who builds his own reality. Could you picture yourself a situation which could be seen as abusive towards your abuser? So, talking purely hypothetical, could he/she/they be abusing you because you abused them too? I'm not taking sides, i don't even know what kind of abuse we are talking about. To be completely fair, i don't even care haha. I'm just doing stuff...

People are not just one thing the are both. Me too, i'm the one abusing and the one being abused. Depending the situation. Why is abuse even a bad word? People are weird, they function in different ways. Some even like to be abused..."

I do that too. By copying others you bond with them and they trust you more. By taking their emotions in you, you can get to know people really well (but lose yourself if you do it too much). I can finish other people's sentences and sometimes guess what they are thinking. But you have to learn not to overdo it. For me the solution is keep your mouth shut and don't react on other people's stuff. Do as you are told and answer the questions. When asking or telling something i'm trying to be as methodical as i can. I play out the situations in my head and pick the one i think will go the best and without problems.

One good thing about being able to pick on other people's emotions is that you learn more about yourself. You awake your parts of yourself through them. It's not that they became you or the other way around, your mind maybe just works in that way. You become aware of yourself when you see it on other people."
