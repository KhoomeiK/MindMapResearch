I see you call yourself an incel. I know there is (was ?) kind of a trend mostly in dark places such as twitter calling every guy who doesn't fit in the classic boyfriend/girlfriend relationship an incel (in the common sense ; a women hater / potential mass shooter) but to be  honnest i think it's bullshit.

If A - you don't spread hate toward women and B - You have not commited any crime toward anybody for her gender - Then you are not an incel, period.

Those who use it to call out someone for other reasons are just straight up stupids and their opinion should be treated in consequence, meaning it has no value at all.

I had a friend who had one testicle as well, he told me that to be frank he has had several partners and nobody cares at all.

Seems like you feel guitly for multiple things, i think you should keep in mind you're the victime here. Having a normal life when you lived such an experience is not easy, and i think your main focus should be to recover (not to improve).

May i ask ? Have you tried to see a psychologist ? I mean a liberal one, outside a clinic.

If your parents are willing to help you with it, i suggest you give it a try. Try multiple ones if you don't feel confortable with the first one, the patient/psychologist relationship is important. If you are willing to do so, look for cognitive behavioral therapists, it's effective."

I'm sorry but from my point of view this is a manner of saying men are wired weird. I'm not saying that you have no reason to say it. If you are being stalked by other shitty men this is a totally understandable and coherent point of view.

I don't possess the absolute truth on this matter, i'm just giving my point of view

I think i've reasons to question the statement that says a majority of men are trash though (not telling that i'm sure this concerns only a minority).

I'm not saying that this matter is of the small kind, i do think this is a realy serious matter on the internet that concerns a lot of women. However i think internet represents attrition and sample bias in itself.

Shitty behaviors can be spread by a minority (not negligible) part of men. They, being particularly active can give a false representation of men bahaviors in general. Moreover the threads of women calling out these behaviors are real but cannot give a true representation of men behaviors in general because it is not counterbalanced by threads pointing out all the times where men showed basic human decency because such behavior is normal and have not to be particularly emphasized.

In short i think the matter you are pointing out has legitimacy to be adressed, i'm just questionning the generalization i seem to see particularly in the comment section. If studies show that this behavior concerns a majority of men i'm willing to change my point of view, but i think that it's better to address such problems precisly rather than saying this apply to men by default.

In a more personnal way, i do see the damage that these behaviors cause, but i cannot help to be saddened by the fact other people would be fearful discussing with me because of these behaviors. After all we agree on the fact that these men are trash and we would be all better without them, particularly women.

Sometimes i feel like i'm guilty by default, that i'm an offender by nature because i'm a man and that's what men do.

I think this is a good thing that our society is taking gender problems like sexual harassment seriously, however due to the way information spreads in our current society (through social medias like twitter and its ecomy of the indignation and news channels and their propensity to  sensationalism), i think it can be misleading and give a false image of our social interactions in day to day life.

I can't give you a solution because that's something i spotted not so long ago and i'm currently working on it.

Podcasts are good companions for when you are exhausted but can't sleep.

The most important thing is not to sleep but to listen to yourself, relax and do what you realy want to do. This is a moment for you, not for performance.

OCD,etm76ae,t3_ccbpik,1562953519.0,"I can relate to what you say about having a better understanding about sexual responses like groinal response and how understanding that such a reaction is not relevant concerning your sexual orientation and values is important.

That helped me a lot too. But i think when psychologists say searching for that kind of information is a compulsion and counter-productive is because they know people suffering from ocd won't stop on such information and after a while they will start questionning themselves again and dig deeper and deeper to find the proof they are an horrible person and to try to find the counter-proof to it.

I think you can't win against ocd if you continue to engage in that fool circle. Each time you engage in a reassuring compulsion you put fuel in the infernal engine of the ocd.

What they say is that you have to try to accept the uncertainty you are facing and ignore the uneasyness your ocd puts you in.

Before i was focusing on sexuality matters like you i was suffering from body dismorphic disorder. BDD is a sick condition that makes you think you are absolutely ugly and nobody will like you because of it. It has roots in childhood trauma like the lack of love and consideration from your family and is not realy related to how good or bad looking a person is.

When i was facing this i would run in my bathroom every 10 minutes to verify something on my face and to reassure myself on my appearance. It's a slippery slop. I was focusing on very little details of my face and i examined them on the glass for hours through the day. Whether i could reassure myself on one detail or whether i couldn't was not relevant. If i could reassure myself on one part of my face i would look for and always find an other part to worry on.

And round and round i would go focusing on one part of my face to an other untill my face was only a collection of ugly details having no connection between them and i would not consider myself even human.

That's the same process with pocd. You were focusing on one behavior like groinal response. You looked for reassurance and you found explanation to what you were facing. That reassured you and at that moment you could recognize that you were not such an horrible person just as i could reassured me and recognize i wasn't so ugly when i looked for one part of my face.

But as you are not focusing on that behavior anymore you are looking for other evidence you are an horrible person and you are testing that evidence to fight the feeling and find counter-proof against it just as i was looking for other defaults on my face and tried to fight the feeling i was not lovable.

I couldn't win against body dismorphic disorder by looking in the mirror and seeking for reassurance. What i did to kill it is the exact opposite. I looked at my face only twice a day for pratical things only like washing. I would not let a single inch of ground for my disorder to play with. No matter how urgent the compulsion was, no matter how tiny the compromise seemed, i had a simple rule wich was to not go to the bathroom and to not look at my face to seek reassurance. And after a while the disorder died from lack of fuel, that was a total win against this piece of shit of obsession.

I'm not saying that's easy to avoid compulsion. I know it's very hard and i'm actually facing the same obsession that you and i find it more difficult to avoid because you have no such simple binary rule to counter the compulsion like not going to the bathroom. Sometimes you just can't stop thinking about it and testing it. I heard that avoiding children for example is counter-productive and will only make you feel there's a real problem with you.

But i would suggest you to try to accept the uncertainty your ocd puts you in no matter how real it feels and how hard it is and to avoid as much as possible reassuring compulsions. You can start by the simplest things like going on your browser and looking for reassuring information.

Once again i'm not saying that it's easy. Actually i can tell you this because i'm in a good day and i would look for reassuring information too once in while.

But keep in mind that the problem is not what your ocd makes you think you are but the problem is your ocd, and that you can't win by engagind in reassuring compulsions.

That's why i will not react on the question you asked at the end of your message. Because that's not relevant.

You are not your thoughts.

I hope you'll find a therapist that fits you soon.

Take care."

Anxiety,erqzw8n,t3_c3ay8j,1561156389.0,"I'm in the the same kind of place. I've been torturing myself with anxiety, negative thoughts and fear of judgement for months now and it got worse some weeks ago. 

I'm so tired of this state of mind, depression can be alluring.

 I dream about those ""melancholic meditations"" i used to have when i was on depression some years ago where i would sit for hours in the shower just feeling and hearing the water droping.

For a moment the anxiety would shut down and i would be just floating away. 

I feel like i want depression completely envelops me just so my anxiety would go away, just so i wouldn't think about the judgement of others and would be focusing on my own feelings.

But I know for a certainty that depression can be a dark place and negative thoughts can be exagerated by it. I think i may regret making such a wish if that comes true.

Anyway, i think having such thoughts about depression says something about your current state of mind and that you should talk to your therapist about that, i know i will.

Take care."

ChernobylTV,eqdzl55,t3_bxvdog,1559997275.0,"Think that behind this ""Russia hates Chernobyl"" statement is the expression of some basic childish and confused russian bashing. I saw a lot more of ""lololol russians hate it"" than russians acually hating it. In fact the only reactions of ex soviet people I saw were positives. Although those same people were saying that yes, some older USSR nostalgics may dislike the show."
