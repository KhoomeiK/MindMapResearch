That’s putting a lot of pressure on yourself and not accurate. 

Sometimes counselors and patients aren’t a good fit, like any relationship. They won’t take it personally if you aren’t meshing. You say you’ve been going for a few months and maybe it made you realize you and he don’t work. Tell him and he will be GLAD to find someone who can help you. The point is to help you and if you feel like it’s not helping then reach out to those professionals about your concerns. Your opinion on your recovery is important too.

Even if you really are a piece of shit, you don’t deserve to be horrible to yourself. Dealing with the parts you don’t like about yourself is about growing up. It hurts a lot but you get through it as a stronger person. 

I know you feel like you can’t reach out to those in your life, and you may be right about a lot of them, but you’d be surprised who will step up."

depression,ez2b8xi,t1_ez28zz7,1567654185.0,"For now. Sometimes it takes years! I was in counseling for 5 years for depression and anxiety and it never really felt like it was helping. It wasn’t until I was diagnosed with the right thing that I actually started benefiting from the therapy. It took a long time to be diagnosed properly and even then it’s still going to be a constant in my life. 

It’s time to reach out to someone. You sound like you’re stuck, depression is no joke. There is also hope, humans are incredible and can tolerate and grow from the worst circumstances. It’s all up to you. Sometimes it takes something drastic to course correct, but taking your own life won’t solve anything, it just ends everything. 

It seems gratuitous now, but it may not always feel like that. Also it’s possible your counselor isn’t a good fit.

Don’t give up on yourself. You have to learn to retrain that part of your brain that makes you feel like a piece of shit"

It was ... offputting at first, I walked into a room with 3 people who were over 65 talking about their struggles, which is fine but made me a little overwhelmed because I think I need to talk to people my age (35f) to feel more comfortable.  Thats on me, not them. 

to my relief, about half an hour later, two young(er) people show up and the whole room lightens.  

There was a moderator, but i think the point is that it's everyone is in the same boat and we meet up to talk about it.  Some are bipolar but there were diagnosis that people had.

It was in a building that looked like a lot of different types of groups , next to a gym and some other things I wasn't paying attention to. 

&#x200B;

I don't know how anyone else is, but I tend not to trust people at all.  I've had a very complicated relationships my whole life and I couldn't figure out why.  Everything I learned from this group was that I have to rely on a very few amount of friends.  People who can't handle how unpredictable you are, can't be in your life.

I think it'll help me because at the very least its a weekly checkup"
