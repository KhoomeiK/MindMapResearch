They may ""section"" you, which legally means you will be held there for a few days. It sounds so scary, but clearly you know you need help with this, so just remind yourself this is what you need to heal. Once they make the decision to keep you, you will be transferred to a psych unit, where doctors will make med adjustments and there are precautions to make sure you stay safe.
