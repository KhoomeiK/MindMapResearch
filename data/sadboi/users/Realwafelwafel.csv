Minecraft Java, is only for pc, but has a lot more things you can do with it, mods, better multiplayer servers, better controls, better redstone mechanics (of you are into that). The only downside is that it is hard to create your own server.

Note: you can get bedrock for every device, but Java only for pc if I'm right."

As the age of people having a phone becomes younger, games don't have to be complicated.
Kids see an ad, just simply download it (without knowing that there are way better games) play it for a while and then go on to the next game.

A couple of years ago these stupid games weren't dominating the top 25 of the app store e.g.
Now they are and I don't like it."
