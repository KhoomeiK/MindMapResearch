Next day she sees the lady waiting in the yard to give the ball back and bada bing bada boom they become the best of friends.

A dream road trip has to be somewhere with a lot of nature. Funnily enough, an old friend I met off of reddit did a whole road trip out to visit me. I think that was two years back? They lived in Colorado with some beautiful mountains for hiking. What I would love to do is the opposite, where I road trip to visit someone and then we go hiking together."

AMA,fnxw5fg,t1_fnxv57y,1587347627.0,"I'd love to get a tattoo if I stop. I mean, I play to get smaller ones either way. My sister is a big fan of getting small tattoos in discreet places: a quote that runs along her hip that is perfectly covered by bathing suit bottoms, a tattoo that runs on the inside of her finger. I love her approach.
Besides tattoos, I don't using drawing to cope because I use to be an artist of sorts. However with depression, I fell out of loving art and into a perfectionist attitude that none of my drawings would be good enough. Art ended up making me want to hurt myself more because I didn't feel good at it."

Although it isn't cheap I think it's still worth it to make one cause you get the satisfaction of making it yourself, and it will still be somewhat cheaper than buying.

I learned to knit at first because my dad's mother gave me a pair of knitting needles. I went on YouTube, watched a video or two, bada bing bada boom. Never actually knitting something in full, but it was fun to do.
A few years later my other grandma told me about crocheting, to which I learned was actually different from knitting. She has a crochet club with a group of older ladies (and one man that just comes to talk about drama). She invited me to it and taught me to crochet. If there's anything I miss from being in quarantine it's that group."

The worst part of it all is not being to tell anyone. I tried to twice. As I said in another comment, the school's idea of help is calling your parents to put you in therapy. Which we can't afford because a lack of healthcare."
