I always share information with my therapist and psychiatrist, and I can only recommend you do the same. Also, if anything, you  acknowledge your behavior (even before it happens), which is better than 99% of people. 

Balancing friends, family, school,  and relationships is incredibly stressful. Because you’re a normal person, you get overwhelmed. I guess my recommendation is to step back and try to see yourself in the position you’re in and be conscious of it. You’re a human who can’t handle everything perfectly and that’s just fine."

I’d definitely try it if you have questions and have no idea how to answer them. 

Also, letting people around you know you need help is always good. You might even be surprised by who really does care. 

Sometimes depression comes in waves and you have to ride the damn thing out. Keep looking for whatever makes you happy and it will be worth it when you find it."

You’d be depriving yourself of this  opportunity if you did things differently. If they jumped into a relationship quickly, then it’s likely because they cannot handle being alone and facing what you’re going through now. You have to embrace the fact that you will suffer, but also you will get stronger. 

A mentor of mine who once said, “So you feel pain? That’s a good thing.” When you get through this, all the pain will make you so much stronger. That quote has often helped me."

BreakUps,fcq2q7w,t3_eigng6,1577877446.0,"You’re only human if you have obsessive thoughts over someone who broke your heart. You don’t have to embrace the idea that you’re going to think about them all the time, but acknowledging that it’s going to happen—merely as a consequence of being human—gives you a perspective that helps you access yourself and your breakup, which is helpful. Sometimes it’s hard to know how to move forward and know where you are unless you have a full understanding of where you’ve been. 
I wouldn’t dwell on the missed opportunities because it seems like you’re giving yourself time to actually move on instead of looking for a quick escape emotionally and physically.

If you run into her, she’s going to assume it’s deliberate and think you’re pathetic and desperate.

Try to find and create stability in your life. Also, remember that if they’ve moved on, then they don’t care like you do, and you deserve better than that. There may be things you like about this person, but you cannot separate the good from the bad and they’ve caused you lots of pain.

As an example, at the gym, I ran into a guy I’d met once and hadn’t seen in a while. I told him if he ever wanted to grab a lift, then hit me up. I was the one reaching out to him making the first moves. Now we get drinks and stuff. I’ve tried to find more hobbies in common with people I’m trying to befriend (video games, music, sports). At school I went up to some people I kinda knew and pretended we were good pals. Eventually we started hanging out, and I workout like every day with one friend from school. They basically adopted me into their group and now I’m meeting even more people through them. 

Medication helped me chill out and do all of this. If you’re not comfortable around other people, they can sense it and not want to be around you. Also, I downloaded some audio books on making friends, charisma, and conversations which helped too."

Don’t be negative. When she does something you like be very positive though. 

Also, she might be losing feelings for you, whether it be time, distance, etc. if you’re not afraid to let her go, then she will probably stick around a lot longer. Consider meeting new people yourself and show her that you could move on from her if things did fall apart.

Tbh, your friend seems kind of toxic. It seems like he’s expecting you to drop everything for him whenever he wants, which is immature and selfish. I’m not saying totally dissolve the friendship, but if things aren’t going well with you guys, you shouldn’t beat yourself up about it because he might just be a difficult person. Given these facts, it seems like you guys can fix this though. Have you hit him up since the text? And why did he drop out?
