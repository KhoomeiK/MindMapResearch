I am terrified but also hoping it will just be a talk. but it is all i can think about. I just need to see her and figure this out. Maybe give him a little space and he will come around and be willing to have an adult conversation soon?

I am really sorry you are going through this and stressed about it. I hope it all is settled soon. This is such a crazy time for everyone, no one is acting themselves"

I so wish I could give advice but it seems like my relationship is on the verge of ending and maybe if my partner can‚Äôt deal with my anxiety, especially when it‚Äôs improving, it‚Äôs for the best.

AnxietyDepression,fo9a8mv,t3_g66yux,1587614223.0,"I have been having terrible nights too, I am so sorry that you are having such a hard time! I am definitely letting my anxiety get the better of me. Have you talked to your husband about how bad it has been getting for you? It helps to have the person you're with know that you are struggling and have them there to help and understand what you are going through. I know it doesn't feel it now, but you will come out the other side of this. Do you have access to remote counseling? I started seeing my therapist via facetime when we had to start sheltering in place. Having her to talk to, and my meds adjusted have made a difference."
AnxietyDepression,fo99k0f,t3_g6f2v0,1587613745.0,"I just made a post for the same reason - I've been struggling and needed to get it out to people who don't actually know me or have a stake in it. I am sorry you are having a hard time and struggling at the moment. With everything going on, it makes sense that things are feeling worse, I don't know if that is validating at this point , but it is something I have to keep telling myself. My meds were adjusted a few weeks ago and that helped a lot and we upped my (now) facetime therapy sessions to two times a week and that has helped too. Even if it just makes me get up and ready for a session.

&#x200B;

I really hope you start to feel at least a little better so soon. Hang in there!"
AskWomenOver30,fnrev7t,t3_g3487f,1587186862.0,Her determination and empathy are two of her best qualities. She puts her mind to something and she gets it done. Her empathy goes so far beyond what she even realizes. She always considers herself hard or cold but she is one of the kindest people I know. I really value having her in my life.
AskWomenOver30,fnrep8j,t3_g36x6m,1587186726.0,I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your day! Sometimes when I feel that way I take a super long bath and even just get back into bed for a while. Chatting with a friend helps. Even replying to posts on here can help me feel more connected (thus my comment-hi!). But again it‚Äôs a shitty feeling and I hope your day turned around!

AskWomenOver30,fnchina,t3_g0om59,1586836892.0,"I still struggle with this at times but it has gotten much better. My partner and I are very different in some ways and things I think should be common sense she doesn‚Äôt think much of and vice versa. So I have learned that just because I think, or would like, something done differently doesn‚Äôt mean she realizes that (unfortunately she can‚Äôt read my mind) so it is something I‚Äôve been getting better at. But it can take time, especially if it was difficult in previous relationships. 

I hope you get to the point where you feel comfortable communicating openly with him, because it could be as simple as that for you both."

I‚Äôve been having anxiety and panic attacks a lot and my partner is experiencing a lot of anxiety as well. It‚Äôs been hard to feel connected fully, but I‚Äôm telling myself in the end we will come out stronger. They closed the parks here so that is really making it worse this week too.

It‚Äôs hard, but I really hope we can all get through it - a lot of face timing with my therapist!"

Anxiety,flmjwm7,t1_flksbqc,1585285854.0,That does sound really difficult. I have friends that sought couples counseling to combat one partners reaction to the others anxiety. Your mental health is super important -- make sure you're advocating for yourself! <3

In person and over the phone we do really well, and we are going to talk tonight, so I‚Äôm hoping it will help resolve it. I rarely have anxiety or panic attacks and more generalized anxiety which I think makes it worse for her. Having said that we are usually great at communicating, I just like to talk about things instantly because of my anxieties and she likes to wait and think things over for a day (which really helps with my anxiety haha)"
