depression,eqgt7i8,t3_bycijd,1560042197.0,"I think it’s just this idea what EVERYONE is special. And as we’re raised with this idea we slowly lose touch with what makes us happy and we begin to focus on proving to others that we are special or “gifted”. I, myself went from being a honors student to fuck it mode. I’m a lot happier honestly, I don’t force myself to be perfect. I think you should focus on doing things that work for you instead of replaying others comments in your head."
