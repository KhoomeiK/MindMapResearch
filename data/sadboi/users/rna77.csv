BPD,fr3k7ua,t1_fr3f8gp,1589859212.0,"Empathy is about imagining possibilities and then testing out how that would feel for us.

I think the confusion comes when someone with this condition negatively imagines what the other person may think (which is typically a projection of fear) and isn't open to hearing the real story. They say deciding something is true without investigating is called making conclusions.  The problem with conclusions is that no more information can get in. The decision to feel bad has already been made.

If I were your friend or partner I would ask you if you were willing to write down a cheat sheet for yourself for what to do if you feel disrespected or invalidate or nobody understands you and read it after you come back to the resting state.

It could be something as simple as ""remember your boyfriend has said if you say some mean stuff when you're dysregulated to say this when you gain your composure..."" 

I think most partners of someone with bpd just wanna hear that their partner admits that they were dysregulated. It doesn't matter why. No blame needs to be assigned. Mature partners can handle this but they have needs to.

Also sometimes our bpd loved ones want us to understand their behaviors when they don't even understand. It feels like a double standard.  To avoid this conflict and to co-regulate Stan Tatkin- says ""lead with relief""
Ex.  ""Honey I totally lost it and raged and I don't expect you to understand why bc I am trying to understand myself. I just want you to know that I'm sad it happened and I'm afraid I hurt you with things I said.""

It worked for me. I could've totally dealt with this.  What the non bpd people can't understand is not being given reasons why there cute gizmo turned into a gremlin (movie gremlins- if gizmo made contact with water their evil twin came out.)

There's a study that showed when people cut in line with no explanation, people would get mad. But if a reason was given people were ok with that.  Conclusion? People's minds need reasons why something is happening.

Just give them reasons ""I was feeling scared that you would leave me and so my brain went to fight mode again.."" etc etc.

I don't think bpd people lack empathy bc empathy uses imagination. I think their brains are afraid of vulnerability- to say or own ""I'm scared. I'm insecure"". It's really just taking on the same energy that boys are taught and it's the reason why there are bad behaving men out there. Their fear of being vulnerable makes them angry at whoever they're afraid to be vulnerable with."

How is that person supposed to dialogue. Do you think it would help to leave a to do list?

For both yourself and the other person.

For example, in the movie 50 1st dates, she lost her short term memory so Adam Sandler has to play a wake up video everyday to remind her who she is.

Those that don't have bpd can't understand why we get pushed away but maybe it's temporary memory loss of who we really are or who they themselves are like Drew Barrymore would get angry bc she didn't recognize him the next day."
BPD,fr2mlbt,t1_fr2hm61,1589839955.0,"The thing is you can step outside of yourself.  I learned this by default and taking on the negative projections and by having to get abandoned I realized my ex partner subconsciously (not intentionally) wanted me to experience her feelings of abandonment.
And I did. And it hurt like hell but it taught me how to search for solutions. I Wanted to get out of pain.  But during my ride I also could see my pain pathways were imagining pain. I was imagining her with new lovers etc and I couldn't stop.  It was only when I stopped trying to push those negative imaginations away and gave them permission to just exist that they didn't need to revolt anymore.  Now I know the process and hope to teach others."
BPD,fr2dbi1,t3_gm46lo,1589835323.0,"I have a daughter with these symptoms (which are better now (fingers crossed) and my last partner had bpd traits.  From the other side it's heartbreaking. We see so much love mixed with internalized hate and then in case with my ex projected out on their loved ones (I think it's a little worse with romantic partners bc sex complicates love).

The hardest part is fighting the enmeshment and trying to help the partner can ignite or trigger more anger. We can start to lose ourselves (speaking from other nons that I've interacted with).  

I wish people suffering with bpd could step out of their bodies (like a near death experience) and see what it looks like for their partner or close family.  What they would see is how much love most healthy partners have for them. We are the ones that get pushed away the most (the healthy partners) bc I think as one of my bpd friends used to say ""I like hanging out with dysfunctional people bc it makes me feel good about myself""
That's too bad-i bet most healthy neurotypical s just want their partners to feel safe, trust them etc.  When they don't it can be so hard on the non bpd partner bc they want those qualities that create happy relationships.

I have said this before in other threads. The brain can be rewired to create different responses. It just needs practice."
BPD,fr2ax8i,t1_fr1bzbj,1589834152.0,"There are several books I can recommend:
Wired for love Stan Tatkin-
Cupid's poison arrow- Marnia Robertson

The first talks about Co-regulating. 
Co-regulating in relationships is a skill that is developed just like anything else.  Babies aren't born knowing how to dribble a basketball. Some may have more physical abilities like Michael Jordan but he still needed to practice.

We don't know relationship skills when we are a baby. We just know how to be cute little creatures and get love.  If we don't get love when we are little (see still facing with babies) the baby can grow up looking for that constant feedback (this is just one example , not saying it's yours).

So learning to build a healthy relationship is a skill.  Of course after learning how to shoot baskets successfully then the player may learn to love the game. Nobody loves the game of love if they don't learn communication skills and co-regulating skills. It's like not knowing how to play b-ball and then thinking every gym you go to sucks.  

So I submit that going through all those life events hoping to ""fall in love"" is like going to all the stadiums to play b-ball without ever learning the skill of playing. Every stadium might trigger negative experiences.

I heard someone say "" we do not fall in love, we share love, and we partake in sex to celebrate or appreciate our love for each other.""

The second book explains how sex without bonding exercises actually can cause couples who have high dopamine levels to break apart.
Participants in the study noticed their threshold for tolerating neg emotion went down for up to 10 days after sex. In other words the participants ""crashed"" hormonally and saw there partners resentfully bc they became each other's ""drug"".  Very interesting stuff. They should teach this in school instead of wasting our time on trigonometry but they don't."

So the first step in healing his clients was to get their ""main personality"" (the voice that says I can't take this anymore) to stop judging itself.
The second step is to talk with these rogue parts and ask specific questions (read the book).

I've practiced hypnosis and just like you can teach the mind to shut off pain you can train the mind the opposite.

Many people labeled with no empathy have nervous systems that learn to tolerate pain.

A therapist that worked with returning war prisoners observed that in order to survive, their brains got conditioned to ""like pain"".  So not just numbing pain but linking it to pleasure centers in the brain. Why? To survive. The ones that didn't died.

So the wiring or self protective mechanisms can be ""tuned"" or reconditioned.  The tricky thing is we can develop competing programs (parts) in our mindscape that try to counteract this process.

You have taken the first step to getting evidence that it can be done. The brain can be rewired. 

Congratulations again."

BPD,fquewc8,t1_fqu3e88,1589657679.0,"People think they have fear of rejection but in fact they have a fear of happiness bc there is danger and pressure in being happy. No danger in feeling bad if someone is used to it. Fear of public speaking is NOT about fear of being rejected; it's fear of not being good enough, or being what's perceived as perfect.

Skilled Speakers report still having fear when they get up initially on stage but they learn the fear is just adrenaline pumping through them.

So they overcome this by practicing what they are going to say or do.  If speakers can be trained then we train ourselves on what to do if adrenaline kicks in (fear response) or voices from ""parts"" surprise us.  Learning new dialogue is really the key"
BPD,fque37b,t3_gkxwcc,1589657212.0,"The thing about preparing for the worse is that it conditions the neurons in the brain to easily go to that thought pattern or memory.  One way to handle this is to pay attention to: is it a picture you see or an auditory statement? Or a question?

So if it's: he's probably gonna dump me.
That's a statement looking for a bid. A bid is when the mind is testing or looking for data (is. Does he live me). But the question gets dissociated and a part of the mind gives an answer.  Now you can train your mind to ask is that true? Is it absolutely true?  Or could this be my fear talking (protector part)?

If it's a question: I wonder if he hates me? The fear is really based on a dissociated statement that already is running quietly in the background (I hate myself. Or I hate myself bc xyz).  In this scenario, forgiveness with admission calms the nervous system or fear response down. Ie. I forgive any part of me that is running a program that says ""I hate myself"".  

This forgiveness actually taps into or trains the mind to learn how to state change back the other direction.  Once you learn to pendulum your positive voices back then it conditions the neurons to wire together more easily in that direction"

With that said remember non of us are perfect so when you put pressure on yourself to be the best you can be, that pressure can lead to expectations. Expectations (especially if unchecked) can be relationship killers.

There's two words that can totally transform our tendency to think black and white: ""cutting slack"".  Cutting slack looks like this: if I know I've put somebody through stuff bc of my situation, pain , depression etc and they forgive me then when they faulter , make a weird face, say something that triggers me etc , instead of reacting I take a time out and remember all the times they put it with my stuff.

If I'm comparing too much I take a break. Honestly we can do it in any category. 

I think the way out is too use our imagination consciously.  When we use reactively we get stressed but actively try to imagine being without a partner. Imagine all the energy it takes to find a trusting partner. Imagine all the steps needed for that.  Notice if any stress pops up about that.  Now go back and visually write down all the things you like about your boyfriend.  Not about whether he's doing this for you or doing that but just as a person.
Is he a nice guy?
Is he kind to children and animals?
Does he respect people? (They always say watch how your partner treats min wage workers)
Does he remember your birthday?
Etc etc.

Then look at your value list in partnership:
The things you value in a partner.

Also a value list is about character not specific things like does he shower me with praises etc.  Women do like this but lots of players use the knowledge of this to manipulate women.
Average guys in relationships probably won't compliment all the time.  It's like having children. If a parent over compliments it makes a child self conscious.  

Healthy relationships are about mutual respect and mutual love and mutual values.  I look for the likeable factor. Do we like each other? Do we respect each other? Are we compassion ate with each other?"

Imagine having a fatty liver due to being alcoholic, stopping drinking for one day won't be enough time. But 90 days changes will happen.  It takes 30 days to form a new habit. So having one conversation isn't going to fix a wiring pattern that took years. One needs to have a plan and maybe you did try this for 90 days? I'm not sure. The above is more about what it takes.

But to get out of Fight or flight
You think about the thought of running, then rate on a scale 1-10, 10 being worst where you are at emotionally. 

Allow yourself to feel all the emotions.
Then acknowledge any part or parts that might be feeling this way and ask them if they are willing to join your new healing team. Wait for yes or stand up and do the away test. Forward yes. Backwards no.

When you forward now you have your answer.

Then ask the healing squad to heal any Part that is running from relationships in order to feel safe and ask them to change all the programing that was trying to keep you protected in this way. 

Then check to see what your rating is now.

Repeat several times. You can also take deep breaths and hold while touching the temples. Close eyes, another breath. Keep repeating."
BPD,fqk5dhx,t1_fqikzfs,1589420473.0,"Ok I'll try. 

So in learning about how the brain gets wired for neuron pathways, one thing kept showing up:. Our nervous system will search for things that are familiar and also things the give pleasure and relief.  The mind can also develop a team called Parts that have different roles.  

If there is a unconscious belief that relationships aren't safe, the mind will flag healthy , stable and normal as dangerous and look for excitement as a way to validate that. 

It's a defense mechanism just like prisoners of war developed (Garry Flints work) to stay alive.
Their nervous system had to convert pain into familiarity (sometimes pleasure) in order to survive.  The ones that didn't died, reality was too harsh.

So because one of the hallmarks of bpd is fear of abandonment, the wiring gets reversed. What's stable seems painful bc to lose this is a big risk (to the nervous system (limbic)) but searching for an escape is like a prisoner when they first get confined; they want out.  After a while they (their NS) gets comfortable with confinement so they don't try to escape even if you opened the gates.

So with attachment issues and bpd, leaving or escaping is the familiar feeling. The wiring gets reversed.

Solution? Parts therapy showed me (and Garry's Flints book) how to talk to the Parts of the mind that sabotage, the parts that overprotect etc.  All of them have 1 thing in common:
They want to MATTER.  They're afraid if they don't operate like this that they won't be needed. There are ways to talk with them but just know the brain can be rewired (ebbs law).

So most people with bpd have sortve an allergy to hope. But it's really just A Part of them that is pushing that message.  This causes internal fighting (sibling rivalry) which is why some believe real tough cases cut or get suicidal.  They are trying to push the voice away instead of making friends with it.

So much to say but just know that part that feels attractive when some new hotty is around or hits on you needs to know it matters. That part will actually project itself onto the cute guy and by you making him feel like he matters you're nervous system thinks it's getting help and that part of you then feels it's fulfilled it's mission.  When anybody (not just bpd folks) can find that part and internally nourish vs looking for external nourishment, everything changes.

You have the biggest opportunity to heal the planet by healing this wound.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, those that have bpd traits and heal them have the most potential to help others and thus the world. You Matter but you have to be the one to tell that part not me or anyone else."
BPD,fqk1l5a,t3_gjbr9n,1589418595.0,Nobody has asked but does she know she has bpd? Or are you going by her behavior? If she knows that's a completely different scenario then if she doesn't.
BPD,fqifqcw,t3_gj4eck,1589395392.0,"There is a body of work /therapy that is focused on competing parts of the mind.
The brain is physical but the mind is malliable.

When a person grows up with stress the brain can develop maladaptive patterns such as linking relationships in general as ""unsafe"".

Once there is a part that has that program it's like the nervous system goes on alert just by being in a relationship.  

So I learned how to identify these as separate ""parts"" to my main personality.  I did this after I situationally took on bpd traits after a breakup with someone with bpd traits.  

So you can rewire your brain.
I found 2 books that helped me : 1. To heal from being raised by a narcissistic mother.
2. To understand how hormones were affecting perception and basically ruining lots of dopamine driven relationships.

Garry Flint- treating your personality
Cupid's poison arrow- (hormones)

BPD,fqamaeo,t3_ghnjc1,1589221479.0,"Ok here's another perspective. I was on the other side of this so let me explain how I felt.
I actually went to a counselor who talked to me about boundaries. He said if you ask for a recovery time and she paints you black then you will have to decide if you can handle this RS moving forward. The idea here I guess was that he wanted me to test whether my partner was stable.

I can't speak for your bf but I cried many days and missed her more then she will ever know. But I had been through a rough situation like this before and the counselor was trying to help me confront my codependent ways.

So here's what I know. If you speak to the part of the mind that is triggering fear and telling you assumptions and ask it if it is willing to heal. Ask it a question : Part, what would happen if your wrong and I do something that will regret and prove to my bf I'm unstable? 

You see perhaps play a game of opposites. If the part is saying ""he probably doesn't love you"" then do something loving. Work on yourself. Read a book like Wired For Love by Stan Tatkin-. When he talks to you and sees you are interested in taking responsibility he will melt.  (If he's in the 90%). Most nons would do anything to be with their partner if they just own their problem.  People with bpd ARE very loving when they are not in fear mode. 

Show him how you can have trust and faith.
Again I don't know him and maybe there's a possibility that he isn't like me but I can tell you 90% of the partners I survey that don't have bpd love their bpd partners unconditionally. They just are scared you won't get help. Prove them wrong! You have the greatest ability to be a leader right now.  Be who you want to be not what the rogue part or voice is feeding you.  You got this. Time to prove the part wrong about you. Time to show your bf how mature you. You MATTER!!! 
Stand up for yourself by talking to the part that's making you afraid. Tell it if it behaves it won't die. In fact it will get more satisfaction and less pain.

Ie. Treat people how we want to be treated.

Not necessarily a bad thing unless you take it that way and ramp up bad behavior as a way to get your vulnerable side to come out.   

Rather then hate our vulnerability we need to learn to make friends with it.  The way I healed myself from taking on bpd symptoms from my partner was to become aware that my empathy was attracting more trauma bc my ex hadn't healed this yet and had reverse associations between what's healthy and unhealthy.  So at first I hated that I was caring and had tons of empathy bc it's what got me into pain bc the nicer I was to my ex the more she hated me.  (Reversal linkage patterns).

So I learned that under stress our mind can create Parts. Parts or like subprograms of the mind. So when your originally formed personality shines through your bf is seeing that.

So there is a way to break this excitement cycle. 

You take the thought that says (this is boring, he's so boring) and you focus very strongly on this feeling of boring. Typically what will surface is a judging part of you that is afraid of being boring so it creates an association with the person or object and applies negative feeling (called linking).  To break this cycle, one you have to agree that you want to break the cycle.  2. You remember a time when you did something (non sexual) where you felt really good about yourself or in the action of doing it (like going for a run etc). 3. You find a memory of something that you accomplished and see yourself doing it as if it were over and you won. Bring up all those feelings.

Bpds transfer their negative projections to us. They feel broken and by cheating, lying and dumping, they transfer their persona onto the other person.  Conversely, the other person (us) may have not been appreciated in childhood and instead of growing up by dumping our wounds on others those that encounter bpds actually have a core similarity.
We wanted to feel like we ""mattered"".  So what do we do? We project that onto them and they mirror it back temporarily.  But they do it for different reasons: they are afraid of being alone so they'll try anything.  When they break up we don't feel appreciated (old wound) and to fix our wound we want them to feel even more like they matter!

It's like Yin and Yang. They are projecting aweful stuff into us to prove their belief that they are aweful and the nons project their belief of ""you matter"" onto them by putting up with whatever they do to prove they are loved (which is really us trying to prove to ourselves we are loved or that we matter)

Projections of beliefs are fascinating.

Part 2 was learning how to heal this."
BPDlovedones,fq5go4i,t1_fq57utu,1589104699.0,"This is transference.  They can't handle their own feelings of abandonment so they project it onto someone else by pushing you away and replacing you. Now we get to feel their pain. It's like they're carrying a load that's too heavy and rather then dealing with it they give it to you.  

So I finally found some ways of healing this. 
First the transference of the feeling ""I'm bnot good enough"": I've done what's called parts therapy. Basically we can take on this part from them and the strategy is to ask the mind to heal all parts including those taken on from another person.  Then imagine that part changing or healing and sending it back to it home. Kindve like the dog whisperer when he integrates a bad behaving dog into his pack of trained and healed dogs (I wish we had this for humans instead of putting all the bad dogs (humans) together).  Then ask your mind to tell teach this part that they matter and then show it how by the other parts of you leading by example.  So when you have a thought that creates an unreal memory, freeze the memory, see yourself moving around the frozen memory and bring in positive examples of feeling good, safe and respected. Infuse with the feeling of ""I matter"" and also see yourself doing something that is achievable or that you're good at.  After doing this several times open your eyes and see if that thought that was being created has gotten weaker.

It works but takes practice. It's totally opposite of what most people say to do (get over them blah blah blah).  The brain then only associates them coming back with relief. Where with internally taking their negative persona into your healthy dog pound and reabilitating it gives the mind relief bc your not waiting for the bad dog part to go away you are showing it how other good dogs behave by bringing in your good feelings and accomplishment into that painful frozen memory."
BPD,fq52lfm,t3_ggu9cy,1589090566.0,"First may I say. I acknowledge your bravery for confronting yourself.  You must fist know what a big step this is!!
To admit we have a problem is a sign of true strength. Vulnerability is actually very close to the frequency of love.  

Now, you asked what can you do to stop the projections?

Here's a trick I learned. If you have pain and you try to avoid it, it gets worse.  The way to change pain and transform it is to rename it.
Think of your pain. The pain of projecting onto your bf and then say internally ""allowing the pain receptors to get colder. Feeling colder. Only feeling pressure, no pain.  Pressure no pain.  Allowing myself to feel the pressure.

Keep saying this and then ask any part that wants attention, know that you matter. You are important. You are valuable (whisper, pressure, no pain).  Keep this self talk going.

Read the book by Garry Flint about changing your personality.  He had tons of success with DID (multiple personality).  

You got this!  Tell your partner you're wanting to vulnerable and share this awareness of projecting and give him instructions on what to do if it happens again (but first do this exercise).

Well wishes"
BPD,fq51q4c,t3_ggv3wn,1589089827.0,"When I took on my ex's behavior I would do this. I found my mind would imagine thoughts that then created memories. Almost like I would create images of her that weren't real. 
John Diamond calls this negative fanticizing.

But since I learned about Parts therapy I realized a part of me was self harming by creating these thoughts bc I didn't believe I mattered. Once I told that part that it mattered then it slowed down creating those images.
The part was like a child who wants attention and behaves badly to get it.  Once I gave it attention vs running from the pain it calmed down.

BPD,fq4pjhc,t3_ggix38,1589081198.0,"Ok I'm going to take an empathetic viewpoint for the OP.

In a healthy relationship intimacy runs the show versus sexual addiction.  

Here's the difference. Many men and now women are getting addicted to porn. Masturbating itself is not toxic unless it takes over the person and the relationship.

Please read Cupid's Poison Arrow and look up other sources but over orgasming creates massive hormone fluctuations in the brain. Objectifying is one of them.  

Intimacy or warm sex is much different and stimulates bonding. Hot sex or too much orgasm makes us resentful of our partners (they start to feel like a drug to us) and it makes the person less empathetic.

My last relationship was lost due to minor bpd traits that were exacerbated by excessive masturbating and orgasming.  

She would masterbate and shift into paranoia and act like a totally different person to me. One month she didn't MB for 30 days and I thought we had won and was willing to marry her. Then poof- once she did it again she blamed me for everything was cold etc.

The night she broke up she confessed that she had done it 3 days in a row again. She dumped me through text. We haven't spoken since. She was married to her addiction and like an addict she cared more about that then us.  

You unfortunately can't tell people to get help. They'll resent you.  I hope she heals her addiction. I will always love her but needed to self preserve.

For example, if someone is angry, another person can pick up on that energy of anger and mirror it.   That does not mean they can put themselves in the other person's place and understand.  True empathy requires imagination.  So if someone is imaging that someone will leave them then that's not empathy. Empathy would be ""he's probably frustrated bc ....."". If a person is in their limbic or reptilian brain, they can't have empathy bc fight or flight or freeze responses from the sympathetic nervous stem are triggered.

He said that what happens are different parts of the personality form. Maybe a sad part, an angry part, a controller or protector part (which can be where the jealousy comes from).

He taught patients to question the subconscious to find out if the parts were willing to want to get healed. Many times a part would not want treatment or to get better bc this threatened it's existence (the part thought relinquishing it's role would mean death).  This is particularly true in jealousy.

So he would tell the part if they joined the healing team they would not die but would receive more satisfaction and less pain.

I have learned that this part of our personality is trying to protect us but it can be overbearing. Ever see the movies where the overprotective father or brother scares all the boyfriends away? How's a girl to date?
Difficult right?

So if that PC is strong in you it can play the ""stubborn role"".  But what if you could look at that part as an overprotective dad or brother and say ""hey, I understand your concern but let me make my own mistakes."". The PC can take over and force the part of your personality that loved that person to take a back seat.  What if that person still loved you ? The fear of them not taking you back or rejection could also be showing up for you.  Just something to think about.  By the way my ex is very stubborn too but I fantasize about her healing that and the truth is that if I reached out to her it would reenforce a power struggle bc I can't fight her demons for her.  I'm rooting for you."
BPD,fpxwi9e,t1_fpwd686,1588991009.0,"You have a right to be upset.  Imagine being a bystander and looking at a bf and gf arguing.
See everything that happened and take turns imaging how disempowered both must have.
And notice that nobody teaches anything about how to communicate when we get dysregulated (growing up). No class in middle school. No class in highschool.  And now we have to learn on our own.  Imagine these two people never learned how to take a math test and each one was subjected to a calculus test and told if they failed then they suck.  

Isn't that how it feels when two people are both being tested at something they don't understand.  Notice the compassion you have for them. You can begin to indentify. 
You wish they would cut each other some slack but they are both so embarrassed. One shuts down perhaps due to shame and the other doesn't know what to do with that.

You see right now in relationshipland there is a big struggle. Many don't have the skills to deal with emotional pain and there's alot of it going around.

So first step I have been taught: focus on what you can change. For me, if I say shitty things to a partner I cut them tons of slack for their retreat. I honor that but I accept that I lost it.  Second. Give time for repair and recovery.
When they do come back reduce conflict by admitting ones faults and co-regulating (Stan tatkin- wired for love).  Stan says when there's a fight, the repair should start with compassion (leading with relief) and respect and to put ourselves in the other person's shoes. (I find it easier to look at a fictitious couple like above).

What happens if both stick to this plan is acceptance and forgiveness.

Highly sensitive people are tasked with learning how to shift from pain to forgiveness.
It not easy. But it can be learned. We can rewire our brains."
BPD,fpxujb6,t1_fpxb4en,1588989855.0,You're welcome. We all get disappointed bpd or no bpd.  It's an opportunity to practice talking to the part or parts that feel any negative emotions and asking your higher consciousness to heal that part.  It really works.  When my gf pushed me away and broke over text I could feel the abandonment transfer from her to me. So when a feeling of disempowerment and sadness would come up I asked my healing team to heal any feelings of abondinment and change any history associated with it.  It worked so well but there was still sadness that she wasn't ready to be like you and confront this.  I think bpd is just false programs picked up from stress in the womb and early childhood.  You have no idea how well you're doing do you?  But that's okay bc I see it. Cheering for your new healing team.
BPD,fpvq52j,t3_gfkdax,1588949764.0,"I'm an empath and when my relationship ended with my expwbpd gf I took on her symptoms. It's actually a common phenomenon.  But in taking on her projections I got to experience what it's like to have bpd. And then I went into massive research mode to heal myself.  I found a book by a psychologist who worked on multiple personality disorder and torture victims from prisoner of war.

What he says is that trauma can fragment the brain. I hadn't heard this before. He discovered a way to talk to the mind to get the fragmented parts on what he called the ""treatment team"". Then he would ask the treatment team if they could repair this fragmented part or parts and restore normal or healthy thoughts, memories and functions?  So I started doing that with my own mind and I felt so much better.  

So in his model if you say ""I'm selth loathing or hating myself"" he would say to talk to the part that is doing the hating (usually our protector/controller part) and ask it to join your inner healing team. Then ask the healing team to treat any negative thoughts or personalities that this part may have learned or empathetically taken on from others.

I did this and discovered why I was hating being empathetic- because I was easily taking on others negative thoughts and beliefs!

So I could now totally understand why people with bpd block or dissociate their ability to have empathy. It's terrifying to them bc they don't realize they are just taking on other people's crap and personality aspects.  

After I tested out his procedure I had memories of all the good things I've done flash before me.  I was so appreciative of myself and stopped hating myself for being empathetic and loving someone who wasn't aware of this and was tearing herself apart.

I did go into sadness because I wish people with bpd could know this and then stop hating the rogue part or voice that they really picked up from someone else anyway! 

And yes it can start in the womb - the baby picking up on a stressed out mom.a mom who didn't want the pregnancy etc.

Once people with bpd learn this they WILL change the world.  Those that feel broken have the greatest power to heal.

YOU ARE LOVED!!!"
BPD,fpvnl4s,t3_gfo8o7,1588948325.0,"I wish the stigma of bpd would go away so that people could feel better about getting help. I've been wondering if there were/examples of people diagnosed with bpd learning how to have healthy relationship interactions.  Do you believe admitting that you had a problem was key to fighting this?

I have a friend who admitted he was an addict and his gf took him back bc he finally got real with his affliction. I wonder how many bpd /non bpd partners could have made it if the person with bpd admitted to their partner that they need help?

I wish those who pushed us away would understand that we love them and just want them to take responsibility for their part.  

I think people with bpd have the biggest potential to heal the world by fighting the neurofragments that were created in their minds. 

Thank you for sharing your win. Filled my heart with joy and love. So happy and proud of you for this. You are changing the world by believing you're important and that you matter!"
