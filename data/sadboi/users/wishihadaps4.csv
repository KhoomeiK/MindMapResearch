lonely,fr3t09o,t3_gmfhcv,1589865444.0,"Yeah a little but at the same time happy for them as I don't want them to be like me. Same when I find out if it's a girl and she mentions a bf. If she's cute I've definitely fantasized what it would be like to date her but I'm glad to hear someone isn't as lonely as me.

As much as I hate my life and loneliness I try to take solace that the less people who feel or think like me the better the world will be right? Being alone is one thing, being lonely is another. If it's a long time it's not good and becomes sort of a disease, at least for me whether my own doing or Destiny I can't solve.

Try to be cool when other people mention friends or if they are on the fence about doing something with something, tell them to go for it, it's good to get out I say."
PS3,fr2zakl,t1_fr2py67,1589846803.0,"Ps4 will be out in the wild just like PS3 was and still is. Right now all the ps1,2,3 games are lost because of lack of compatibility. PS3 is losing connectivity to PS4 this year. Sony is sitting on a way to make money and bring more users to their platform. Not only would they make more money but they would be able to resurrect old franchises, see the status of what games have a following and for us it would be damn convenient. If you could play the old cod games like on xbox on ps5, it would keep and resurrect the player bases. Publishers could promote old game sales. We're at a point where you want a service or box to play an immense catalog. Like steam has always done, Xbox followed and PlayStation should too with it's insanely huge and awesome catalog. The ps2 remasters still sell will it's a sign people want those games."

Was skinnier before but works out a lot and got some more muscle but still way too Skinner for almost 6ft. With everything closed my exercising disappeared as too me eating as much. Already lost a couple pounds from before very irritating. Eating likr1500-2000 calories when I should be eating closer to 3000. When I was exercising I did want to maintain a good body so I did worry about getting fat even when I was skinny I worried about getting a beer belly. Neevr been happy with how I look so I have no idea. Hard to bulk easy to eat very little especially when I drink coffee. But men who are skinny or have eating disorders generally no one cares.
