AA is a good place as we all understand as we have been there, I promise. Get a sponsor quickly and start the Steps and at Step 9 you will can will make amends for all of the chaos and harm you caused, which is a huge relief.

Our primary purpose is to help the alcoholic who still suffers, so helping this chap is the right thing to do, no matter how daunting it seems.  Talk to him about your experience, strength and hope and offer to take him to a meeting. I thing you should ask God to take away your fears and to give you the words to help him before you meet. 

Not everyone is ready when they think they are, so if he decides no to check AA out then that is his decision and so you should not carry this load. He knows you are there when he is ready.

alcoholicsanonymous,fjve7k5,t3_ff12wt,1583626207.0,"It would be great for you to go to AA as you have the desire to stop drinking.  
Regarding socializing, being of service is a good way to do that. I love phone shifts. Some times they are cosy with three of us shooting the breeze over pizza and on busy days it can be six or seven with more of a party atmosphere. I am a GSR and go away for weekends with folk in the same district. We have a blast. I have an all girls 12 step convention that I go too for a weekend in April. 
I think what I am trying to say is that there is a huge social environment within AA, and you will see this when you go. Have fun!!

Meetings are informal affairs with a Chairperson who keeps order and a Secretary who does the admin. These guys sit at the front. When you walk in it is usual to have Greeters and these folk will show you where to sit, where the coffee is and explain what will happen. Usually the Chairperson will ask if any newcomers are present and you can raise your hand. This will be really beneficial to you as lots of folk will then chat to you and give you there numbers."

Get every thing ready for bed ( do teeth, see alarm, get PJs on for example).  No electronics from this point on. 

Grab a book and read for around 30 minutes or until you feel sleepy, but don‚Äôt do it in bed.   Bed is for sleep. 

Go to bed to sleep. 

When you wake get out of bed as soon as you can. No electronics or reading in bed. 

Go to bed and wake at the same time. A late night or sleep in is OK once in a while. 

I do this and it really works. Good luck."

alcoholicsanonymous,fi25oml,t3_f616a0,1582072053.0,"Excellent question.  My thoughts.  

We give our will over to our Higher Power and the desire for alcohol is removed. But if we revert back into self will then we may drink as our own will is usually not strong enough to stop us.   So if we knowingly cease attending meetings and doing other activities that keep us close to a Higher Power then I would say that any drinking becomes a choice we make. 

A second perspective is that before coming to AA we drank because we had to, the allergy was too strong for us and we also needed to make our feeling stop.  In this case we had no choice, even if it was killing us."

alcoholicsanonymous,fhc1p2u,t3_f2eb6j,1581454426.0,"Hello. It is lovely that you think so much of you friend to post.  I am 6 years sober and an an active member of AA. 
People feel how they feel, remember you can‚Äôt change or control that. You can just be there.  You could find an ‚Äúopen‚Äù meeting and go with your friend as, Normies are allowed to attend you will see the joy in the rooms. 
AA aims to empower people to get and stay sober and works on an attraction rather than promotion basis. That said, it isn‚Äôt for everyone and although no official figures exist, around 1 in 10 people stay. So it isn‚Äôt for everyone and the call of drink can easily take someone out. 
I am wondering if your friend has an AA Sponsor (like a teacher) yet and has started the Steps. Both of these are very important in early sobriety. Crucial even.  I would say that this is the biggest reason for people going out. 
If I can help further, just let me know."

You have a recognized terminal disease, so please stop feeling guilty. 

You need a sponsor ASAP. I am assuming that you are female and I am sorry if this is wrong.  If you are then the guy you asked was wise to turn you down. Get a female sponsor today. You can‚Äôt do the steps properly without one.

I am 49 and got my PhD at 27.  Things went well, with me gaining more specialized qualifications over time, but I did have what was then diagnosed as depression.  Then at 42 I had a huge depressive episode and my brain turned to mush.  I couldn‚Äôt sort items, no reading books any more or doing simple maths.  I didn‚Äôt know I was BP at that time. 
At this time I also admitted that I was an alcoholic and stopped drinking. 
When back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù I was at about 95% of brain function. I was diagnosed as BP2 in 2017 and have had 2 major episodes since. I am losing a bit of my IQ each time. I am currently off work as I can‚Äôt always understand the technical aspects of my role anymore, concentrating sends me to sleep (not good in meetings or at my desk) and I failed two of five exams I sat which were very straightforward.   I was told by the psychiatric social worker that I may recover my IQ but may not. I am seeing the psychiatrist this week and hope a change in pills may help.

I miss a couple of weeks of work per year with the illness. 

Other folk struggle to get out of bed with severe depression and it is tough for them to look after themselves. It is really tough for them and very debilitating.

Get a sponsor and do the steps
