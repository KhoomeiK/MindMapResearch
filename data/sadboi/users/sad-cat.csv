[This paper gives a lot of numbers taken from the FAO ](https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/hsus-report-agriculture-global-warming-and-climate-change.pdf)

I’ve pasted the part just about fossil fuels, but please read the whole paper because you must also consider: 
“The farm animal production sector is the single largest anthropogenic user of land, contributing to soil degradation, dwindling water supplies, and air pollution.” 
and 
“the animal agriculture sector is responsible for approximately 18%, or nearly one-fifth, of human-induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In nearly every step of meat, egg, and milk production, climate-changing gases are released into the atmosphere”

Fossil Fuels:

“Fertilizer and Feed Production

Burning fossil fuel to produce fertilizers used in feed production releases significant amounts of CO2. Indeed, a main input in modern farm animal production is artificial nitrogenous fertilizer, vast amounts of which are used in the cultivation of farm animal feed.89 This fertilizer is primarily applied to corn, but also to other feedcrops like soybeans, barley, and sorghum.90 Worldwide, more than 97% of soymeal and over 60% of barley and corn go to feed farm animals.91
Most of that fertilizer is produced in factories dependent on fossil-fuel energy.92 Manufacturing nitrogenous fertilizer requires around 1% of the global energy supply,93 and an estimated 41 million tonnes of CO2 is emitted each year from fertilizer production exclusively for feed crops.94
China, the world‘s largest producer of grain,95 emits the greatest amount of CO2 from this process, releasing nearly 14.3 million tonnes annually. The United States, the world‘s second-largest grain producer,25 emits just under 12 million tonnes, while Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom each emits 2.2-3.3 million tonnes of CO2 per year as a result of fertilizer production for feed crops.96

Energy Use

Maintaining intensive animal production facilities, as well as growing the associated animal feed, may emit 90 million tonnes of CO2 per year due to requirements such as electricity and diesel fuel.97 This is in contrast to extensive systems that have low or negligible comparative on-farm fossil fuel use.98 The FAO estimates that on- farm fossil fuel consumption in intensive systems likely produces more CO2 emissions than does the manufacturing of chemical fertilizer for feed production. The fossil fuel needed varies by animal: A typical U.S. factory farm in the 1980s used approximately 35 megajoules (MJ) of energy per kg of a chicken, 46 MJ per kg of a pig, and 51 MJ per kg of cattle.99
Electricity use in intensive farms makes up a large part of this energy expenditure, especially for ventilating, heating, and cooling monogastric operations, such as pig or chicken meat production facilities.100 But, according to the FAO, feed production accounts for over half of the energy used for animal agriculture systems.101 This does not include the energy used to make fertilizer (discussed above), but the energy used for seed, herbicides, and pesticides, as well as the fossil fuel needed for farm machinery used to produce feed.102

Transportation and Processing

As agriculture becomes increasingly globalized, meat, eggs, milk, and live animals are transported farther than ever before. Approximately 45 million cattle, pigs, and sheep are traded around the world each year,103 and millions more are transported over long distances within a country‘s own borders.104 In addition to the human health and animal welfare implications of transporting live animals between different cities and countries, and
An HSI Report: The Impact of Animal Agriculture on Global Warming and Climate Change 5
the potential for spreading animal disease,105 live animal transport likely consumes large quantities of fossil fuels and contributes to climate change.
Transporting feed, and processing and transporting animal products, may emit tens of millions of tonnes of CO2 per year.106 While the FAO did not include consideration of live animal transport in its calculations, its report did find that transporting feed and animal products to the destinations where they will be consumed emits approximately 0.8 million tonnes of CO2 per year.107
Soybeans and soybean cakes used for feed are shipped from Brazil to Europe, and estimated annual emissions of CO2 from just this single trade route are some 32,000 tonnes. The annual trade of meat between countries results in 500,000-850,000 tonnes of CO2.108
The FAO estimates that CO2 emissions from animal processing total several tens of millions of tonnes per year.109 Processed animal products typically come from intensive systems,110 although energy costs vary widely depending on the product.111 Processing meat from sheep, according to one study, is very energy costly, with 10.4 megajoules (MJ) used per kg of carcass compared to the energy required for processing beef, which uses 4.37 MJ per kg.112 Processing eggs, too, is energy intensive, with more than 6 MJ used per dozen eggs.”

Notice that transport for live animals isn’t even included in those numbers. 

[Found a cheeky article but I can’t check the sources so idk how accurate](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/environment/how-fossil-fuels-are-used-to-produce-meat/)

Avoiding animal products is one thing you can do that would make the biggest impact. 

We should boycott the fashion industry too, though. I do try my best to research and buy ethical clothing whenever I can. 

>	Locally raised, holistically raised meat, isnt the problem. Hunting a deer or turkey in season or fishing with a pole at a local lake, isn’t the problem.

Nobody said that is the problem. You are an outlier, my friend. What percentage of meat eaters raise their own livestock? Less than 3% of pigs in the UK spend their lives outside. 

“‘The world is consuming more animal protein than it needs and this is having a devastating effect on wildlife,' says WWF”

“The new report, Appetite for Destruction, launched at the Extinction and Livestock Conference, says the consumption of animal products is leading to a vast and increasing amount of land being used for crops.”

“Excessive animal product consumption is responsible for 60 per cent of all biodiversity loss, according to WWF, with the UK food industry alone directly linked to the extinction of an estimated 33 species.”

“A staggering 60 per cent of global biodiversity loss is down to the food we eat. We know a lot of people are aware that a meat-based diet has an impact on water and land, as well as causing greenhouse gas emissions, but few know the biggest issue of all comes from the crop-based feed the animals eat.”

“Soy is produced in such large quantities that in 2010, the British livestock industry needed an area the size of Yorkshire to produce soy used for animal feed, the report said. To keep up with rising meat consumption, soy production is expected to rise 80 per cent by 2050.”


There are plenty of old vegans in the world. There was that one 98 year-old dude that died like last year that had been vegan for 30 years.  Problems with plant based diets come from people not eating a healthy diet, but it is easy to eat a healthy plant based diet you just have to pay attention. It’s getting easier every day to eat a plant-based diet. The more people adopt a more plant-based the more accessible it will be for all. These studies aren’t threatening you to go vegan overnight, they’re pleading with you to think about your consumption and try to limit it as best you can. The western culture is built around excess and it’s time to change that. You don’t change anything by playing the victim of getting a finger pointed at you. You just fucking do it. The world needs it."
