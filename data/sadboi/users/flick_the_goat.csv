amazonecho,fp0r4g9,t1_fozt0q4,1588215079.0,"Great! Just to confirm: You can add Apple Music (which you’ve obviously done), but then it’s a second step to set it as the default. It’s described here: 

https://9to5mac.com/2018/12/13/set-up-apple-music-echo-speakers/

Once you do that, you won’t have to say “from Apple Music” anymore. That being said, Alexa should tell YOU that it’s playing from Apple Music before the song starts playing. 

Good luck!"

Once I did get it though, it works great. All songs, play lists and radio stations work as they should. 

I will say - if you add a new station or playlist, it takes a while for it to become available via Alexa. That could be your problem.

BipolarReddit,fjt4yg3,t1_fjr5lwt,1583604137.0,"Thanks for the reply. First - you did absolutely nothing wrong. I’m very proud of you for making a very hard decision that will hopefully result in improved mental health. 

That being said - I honestly believe you are in a position of risk now. I would pay attention to how other managers and execs treat you. Some may treat you like a child. Overly sensitive, etc. Others might be unusually harsh. If you see this, then you’ll know your manager told others about your BP. 

That’s not a great place to be. You can start getting passed over for promotions (“I’m not sure he could handle a promotion”). Or, God forbid, if the company has lay-offs, you *might be* an easy target. 

Please don’t take these comments to mean that I think you made a mistake...because I don’t think that at all. 

I just want you to be smart and protect yourself. These companies can be absolutely ruthless. 

My mom got cancer, so my dad asked to step down into a “lower role” from his director level position so he had the time to take her to doctor’s appointments, etc. He was always one of the company’s top performers. He was laid off 9 months after he stepped down. He wasn’t fired—the company had to lay-off a bunch of people to save money, and he was just a really easy target. Needless to say - that woke me up to the brutality of corporate America really quickly. 

I wish you nothing but the best, OP!! Keep us posted!"

There is medication that can lessen / stop manic episodes from occurring, but (big disclaimer) TO MY KNOWLEDGE there is not a medication that will stop an ongoing episode. It isn’t like you can take 2 Tylenol when you get a headache.

My wife will gently point out when she see’s me becoming hypomanic. At that point I can say “Ok, I’m hypomanic, so I need to chill with the online purchases.” This generally works when I’m hypomanic. 

Sometimes, she will just list in great detail my packages that have arrived. She doesn’t pass judgment, she’s just “politely” letting me know about all of the packages. Once I see her text with the list, I’m like “oh shit.” 

When I get truly manic (rare for me), I generally believe my wife and others are out to get me, so obviously this approach won’t work. 

I honestly haven’t found much that helps me when I’m truly manic. Just gotta wait for it to end. 

I will say though, just generally (gently) being reminded from time to time that I’m manic helps. A few months ago, I was going through a full manic episode and I was absolutely convinced my wife was cheating on me and was bad mouthing me to her friends. (Neither were true)

My wife asked “I don’t know, but could it be you’re manic? Maybe that’s why you think this?” 

It totally snapped me out of it. I was still manic, but I was able to let go of that “battle.”

F-society, 5/9, Deus Group, White Rose, etc. was all real — it was just MM that was participating. Not “real” Elliott. 

When MM blew up WR’s machine, that somehow sent Elliott deep into his own mind (as you put it). He wound up in the fantasy world that he previously created. In the “real world,” Elliott’s body is laying in a hospital bed in a coma (or asleep), while the entire “fantasy” sequence plays out. 

Given that Elliott isn’t the most stable individual - MM somehow forgot about his “fantasy world” creation. Somewhere along the line, he started to believe he was actually Elliott. 

What you see in the fantasy world is Mr. Robot, Angela...and eventually Krista breaking the truth to MM.
