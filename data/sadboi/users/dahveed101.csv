Lmaoo yeah bruh I‚Äôm good out here, just putting some old feelings in the music! I appreciate it man 

Feedback, well first, dope asf looks like you got a fire melody man, I fuck with the 808s lowkey wanna hop on this beat man, it‚Äôs really good. Feels like an r&b/lofi/chill vibe type beat which I personally fuck with. I subscribed to you bro, I might use some of of your beats man good shittt 

Only thing is at 1:20 the little scratch thing, it‚Äôs good, but for the part with just the melody/instrument i think it would sound better without it, but it still sounds great!"

Thank you again, I developed this sort of style listening to Korean rappers lmao, but I don‚Äôt listen to much of young thug but imma listen to him more and see how he does it

I was thinking of taking voice lessons this summer so I will probably go through with it, I appreciate the feedback man really helps a lot ! 

Feedback on your beat, well first, overall I really got into it at 1:48 I really like that vibe. I like the jazzy feel and really upbeat but still a good chill vibe. 

I think it could be better by doing a little less, I feel like the instruments are going against each other at times, mostly the drums, the ‚Äúchorus‚Äù parts are absolutely amazing, with less drums and a simple pattern it could be a bit better, atleast In a rappers stand point. But keep it up man! I‚Äôve tried producing before and it was hard asf, so keep working at it, you can always dm me if you need feedback on any beat !"

Understandable! I also speak two languages and I usually operate in English as it is better then my Spanish. 

Yes, clarity and also generally with English, just improving on that will help you tremendously in my opinion. Your rhymes and the flow will improve the more you do it, I think. 

Try free styling more often like an half an hour each day or so, I believe that can improve your flow and overall pretty fun in my opinion, keep it up bro!"

makinghiphop,f3dztcd,t3_dgpor5,1570852164.0,"What‚Äôs up bro, I‚Äôve been rapping for about a year, I was in the same boat you are. Honestly freestyle, but tell a story don‚Äôt try to rhyme, once you get comfortable with talking on a beat or something try and rhyme, freestyle a lot though, I freestyled 40 minutes going to school and 40  min going home, mostly everyday. Once you get good start writing. To me this was the toughest part. But just keep doing it lol practice makes perfect, I didn‚Äôt get truly ‚Äúgood‚Äù until I started writing tbh.  

Freestyling helps with flow in my opinion, writing makes your ideas come to life. 

I made music On My iPhone then on audacity and now fl studio, you can do a lot with just an iPhone and garage band no lie.  When you get a proper DAW learn to do basic mixing and mastering.

In all just freestyle first try to tell stories not rhyme, learn to write, poetry might help, don‚Äôt be afraid to use thesaurus or a dictionary although you should be fine without em. Practice practice practice, make songs, I‚Äôve made about 50 unreleased songs, I only have 3 out. 

Last but not least, make music you want to hear. One of my recent songs is a funny one and I love it, and other people do too so it makes me more proud of it!
