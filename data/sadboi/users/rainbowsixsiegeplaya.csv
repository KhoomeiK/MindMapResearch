ChickFilA,exd5lbe,t3_crqhag,1566167808.0,Yea we had someone from up front training in BOH he trained for a few days then never saw another day back there. It didn’t help he wasn’t very good but they just didn’t need him back there they already had everything set up how they wanted it but if you hear about a person leaving / taking a vacation/ going to school ask them then and you might catch them at the right time and you’ll begin you’re hellish back of house training.
ChickFilA,exd4yia,t3_cru9s9,1566167351.0,Be thankful you don’t have to smell it or see the thick layer of cheese that sits on top after it’s been in the oven for 35 mins!
ChickFilA,ex8z309,t1_ex87fd3,1566080933.0,My store doesn’t have them but i get that on my break a lot . Just drop a spicy filet on the grill
ChickFilAWorkers,ex40ld4,t3_cpyq2p,1565995444.0,"Dude that thick layer of baked cheese that sits on top after it’s been cooking in the oven for 35 mins is really stomach turning . Coupled with 4,000$ hours everyday at lunchtime is just really getting me sick of this stuff."
ChickFilA,ex3ylyj,t3_cqvzi4,1565994528.0,"This Mac N Cheese has literally caused us to call a few extra people in everyday for lunch. We normally have one person on the secondary line (nuggets , grilled nuggets, and soup.) but since the Mac N Cheese dropped we have to have one person doing the nuggets and one on Mac N Cheese and 4 pans of it in the oven at the minimum at all times . Prep can barely prepare enough of it before we run out ."

USPS,eqgtgsy,t1_eqgmft6,1560042350.0,"🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️. This is stressful 😂. There has been some torrential downpour aka thunderstorms in my area not sure why it would affect the distribution center in Phoenix. It says : Your package will arrive later than expected, but is still on its way. It is currently in transit to the next facility.: have to call usps customer support tomorrow within business hours."
USPS,eqgisal,t3_bydozo,1560037050.0,Right sorry. 9405510298370997338594
