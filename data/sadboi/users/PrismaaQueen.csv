My favorite cartoon, that's so hard. But I'm gonna have to go with currently Steven Universe. It's just so cute and I love it. Can't wait for the movie!"

You paid for this, it was kind of you to invite the family, and wouldn't be fair to his family if you gave it to yours. It sounds like you'd have a better vacation if they left, anyway."

Thorn: Been feeling like lately my immediate family doesnt wanna have much to do with me. They none really wanna talk to me, and it's weighing pretty heavy on my heart.

Bud: I have another dentist trip, it's gonna be a lot of future trips, but I'm finally getting work done on my mouth that's been neglected for years!

Welcome to the community! I'm pretty new too, but everyone is so nice and fun to talk to. It feels like one big family and I absolutely love it!"
