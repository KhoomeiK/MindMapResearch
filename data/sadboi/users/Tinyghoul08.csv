Lolita,fq7xhhy,t3_gh9r55,1589154214.0,"I feel like the wine red would look cute in some wrist cuffs or smaller head pieces or even in some printed socks! I just bought an A-Line petticoat today and from what I‚Äôve been seeing, they are a LOT smaller at the waistline than the cupcake shaped petticoats, they don‚Äôt come out as far. There‚Äôs also different styles of a-line, poofier and some that aren‚Äôt as poofy. That kind of petticoat is probably the best kind you could use for that dress due to the high waist"

SuicideWatch,f2n6s2c,t1_f2n65jc,1570312711.0,"I‚Äôm asking because I need help but I‚Äôm too scared to ask. Attempting suicide without intent to die seems to be the only thing I can do right now. My parents don‚Äôt realize how much I am going through inside of my head. I moved back in due to the fact that my roommates would always tell me to die, to slit my wrists or hang myself, and it‚Äôs more or less the same cycle here with my father. I‚Äôm hopeless."
