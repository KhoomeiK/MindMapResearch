Have you tried anything to soothe it? My thinking is that knowing you were “helping” it, as much as you can help a flare up, might help lessen your anxiety. I accidentally ate some potato on Saturday which made me SO stressed as it’s my biggest trigger, but I felt a little calmer after I drank some turmeric powder mixed with water - perhaps you could try this too? A hot compress could help as well!"

I’m racking my brain to think of something else you can try but I’m sleepy, I’ll update this if I can think of something!
