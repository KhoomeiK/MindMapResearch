It might’ve been Beane or another GM, but they talked about how they look for guys that don’t know anything but football and can’t live without it- either it’s their only potential way of making money or the only thing they’ve ever really been around, when scouting. It’s gotta be hard for a world class athlete at the highest stage to be externally motivated when they know they can do the bare minimum and still be good enough. Finding guys with that fire and maturity to be internally motivated is definitely a consistency among our players. It’s why Josh is a perfect fit. The guy got rejected by every school, coach, and coordinator outside of Wyoming and I think Eastern Michigan.
