I was constantly afraid I was getting sick, like I had a fever, or chills, or something.

Took me until around late December to finally ""get over"" it and start feeling like my normal self again. I finally got to a place where I said, ""Getting sick is no big deal. You'll feel nasty for a couple weeks and then be better. It's ok.""

Anxiety,fl0mt3b,t3_eupik4,1584710873.0,"Man, really rough night for me last night. Felt a little cold and convinced myself I was getting the chills. Went into a full blown panic attack and had trouble sleeping. Eventually I dozed off and while I'm still feeling a bit off this morning, I do feel better. This thing is just wrecking me mentally. 

Glad Animal Crossing is out today. Going to do my best to use the weekend and recharge."
Anxiety,fkubltc,t3_fkayil,1584546294.0,"Ha, literally just came to this sub to check this exact thing. That's funny.

The tickle in my throat/slight cough/tightness in breath comes and goes for me over the past 2 weeks. No fever and no ""actual"" cough - just enough of a tickle where I think I have one coming on. Lately the shortness of breath thing is happening, but when I lay down and try and relax it goes away.

Definitely anxiety related. Stay strong everyone!"

nyc,fkbbo2n,t3_fhib22,1584029984.0,"No cold here, but definitely dealing with ""anxiety"" based symptoms. My hypochondria acts up and I keep thinking I have a cough developing. Every time I feel warm I freak out thinking I have a fever.

Rough times."

It’s crazy how wide ranging this thing seems to be."
