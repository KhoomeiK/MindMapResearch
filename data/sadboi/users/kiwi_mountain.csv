2. What I learned from love// The Tower
3. What holds me back from love// Five of Wands
4. Readiness of heart// Two of Swords
5. Readiness of mind// Death
6. Readiness of spirit// Six of Wands

Am I ready for a new relationship?

I desire a strong, solid relationship. I've learned in the past that love can be a heartbreaking and tumultuous thing; it can bring destruction of self. I'm held back by my own issues with creating conflict from seemingly mundane differences between my partner and I. It is up to me whether or not my heart will be open to new love. Mentally I'm ready for new beginnings. My spirit is ready for accomplishing and maintaining a happy and healthy relationship.

Deck is the Radiant Rider-Waite tarot.
