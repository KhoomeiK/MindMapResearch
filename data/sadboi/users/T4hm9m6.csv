Comparing myself to others elevating them in my head above myself is the issue I have and recently have been able to find the roots of why this is and has relaxed me as my dominant thought is able to question the secondary one."

I have since learned to be easy on myself and the anxiety has lessened so much. I am able to make it through the day without shitting on myself for no reason now. If you can find out the reason with truly being honest with yourself you will hopefully get to the root of your personal anxiety."
