After you get an idea of each customer persona, figure out how your marketing would address their needs. How do you present this device?

Instead, buy mortar from your big box hardware store. Mortar comes in big bags as a powder, and you mix it with water until it has a pretty stiff consistency. At the right consistency, it will stick to your trowel just a little bit but slide off with a tiny bit of force. Here's your list of materials for the project. You won't need to build a form.

* 50 lb bag of mortar mix $5
* Wide plastic mortar mixing bin (a wheelbarrow works well too) $15
* Trowel $10-15
* 5-gallon bucket with 1 gallon clean water $3
* Large sponge $2
* Kneepads or cushion $10

Virtually everything will be available in the concrete section at the blue or orange hardware store.

Add a little bit of mortar mix to the bin. Squeeze just one sponge worth of water into the mix. Stir well with the trowel. It requires surprisingly little water to get the right consistency. You want the mortar to feel a bit stiff but moldable, like playdough. Apply with the trowel."
