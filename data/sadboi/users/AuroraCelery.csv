it's very hard to understand depression though, I'm sure he cares about you and thinks he's doing the right thing

you should try to seek out other sources of support if you can, I find that having someone who I can talk to about depression who doesn't feel obligated to ""fix"" it for me, who will just listen, can help tons. and therapists, of course. therapists are nice cause you're essentially paying them not to judge you.

your depression is not your fault. I wish you the best."

people tend to be quite unfair about it, seeing babies lives as inherently more valuable than adult lives because of their age

elders, celebrities, babies, children

 lots of people tend to be idolized for arbitrary reasons which can lead to dehumanization, isolation, and also devaluation of everyone that *isn't* them"
