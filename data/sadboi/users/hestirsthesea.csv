politics,ex68s75,t1_ex5fjcv,1566041405.0,"Wouldn‚Äôt you say that with a better understanding of historical trends and sociological data that you could make a more informed decision? This knowledge gives me greater context to choose the candidate that suits my needs and the needs of other Americans. My education exposed me to alternate ways of thinking and different cultures. It taught me how to think critically and how to examine an article or study for validity. Many students are taught logic and how to see classic fallacies in arguments (ad hominem, slippery slope, band wagon, etc.) This is important when listening to what politicians have to say. 

Knowledge from centuries of discoveries made by philosophers and scientists are available to us; and students get to learn that information from doctors who have specialized in their subjects.

I have two bachelors in English and Nursing. While vastly different in content, they both taught me how to think critically and exposed me to realities I wouldn‚Äôt otherwise see.

Third episode: I‚Äôm thrilled to finally see the culmination of what the entire series was building up to...but it was done in a single episode?!  We never learned the night King‚Äôs motives, we never learned what the hell Bran was doing.
