So I’ve been ‘fully recovered’ for 2 years now and I’m still the same weight (a bit heavier) when I was classified as ‘weight restored’, but I still have a huge fear of food. I’m always trying to eat less when I can, but it’s hard because I’m a competitive athlete and I have to fit into a weight category. 
I don’t really know if I can give you any advice, because I’m having the same problem. I just want you to know that you’re not alone in this. I still don’t think I’m fully recovered, and still classify myself as anorexic. 
I’m getting therapy soon and I have an amazing family and boyfriend who support me. I hope one day I won’t have a fear of food anymore.
Stay strong x"
