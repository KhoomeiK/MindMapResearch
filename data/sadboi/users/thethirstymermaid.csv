Then they buy the trusted cup. Personally, I think it's probably still safer to do this than use a tampon, but I'd still probably not leave it in that long...just long enough to see how it feels.

You'll be okay...I don't advise it, but some women leave their cups in much longer than 12 hours. So if you need to take a moment and relax watch some TV or something, and then try again you totally can. Sometimes just taking a few minutes to relax really helps."

The more nervous you are the more your body is going to clench up and that's going to make it almost impossible to get it in there. I inserted mine for the first time today. I layed in the bed to do it because it was easier to relax myself that way. I also used a good amount of lube and took it pretty slow. The punch down fold also makes it a lot smaller than the other folds which should help too.
