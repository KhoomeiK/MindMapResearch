The issue isn’t what Lenin said, the issue is how one interprets it. The way the imperialism/national question is interpreted *in the present* is through a capitulation to common terms. Marxism has regressed into “anti imperialism” in increasingly tenuous forms because there are not sufficient conditions for a real socialist movement to form and what is left of what once was is scattered and ineffectual. This is why supposed Marxists are so dedicated to the defense of arguably anti-democratic, illiberal, and highly regimented states if not for strict dogmatic adherence to “Marxism Leninism”. This is disregarding the position socialists used to hold on liberal society. Marxists, in the place of no existing socialist movement, should *promote* the proletarianization of workers and the development of liberal civil rights where there are none as a historical prerequisite for socialism. My whole point is that the origin of the (usually) miscalculated critique of Trotskyists you were going for develops from a misrepresentation of the imperialist/national question and relies on idealist, essentialist, and moralistic terms. Instead of following Lenin in his steadfast (when Lenin says national struggle he means national proletarian struggle) dedication to anti imperialism, the global and transnational proletarian struggle becomes a purely national one. It is one of the most subtle and damaging issues in Marxism now."

For instance, [Lenin expresses this well when discussing Bolshevik opposition to the Jewish Bund in the RSDLP.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1905/may/31.htm) The point isn’t that national liberation/anti-imperialism is unimportant, it’s that the question since the heyday of socialism has been significantly butchered, complicated, and developed enough to make the original message and purpose unclear.

That’s actually one of the most significant and contested questions in sociology. How does a discipline based on self assessment and in hopes of normative/procedural undertakings make any progress in a society which seems to operate unconsciously and free from conscious action? I would say some sociologists, although very few critical ones, argue sociology still has a weigh in on politics. Many may find that a lot of the discipline itself has devolved into a reaffirmation of the current economic order’s ideological status quo which is politically correct liberalism and a turn towards essentialism and identity. If anything, I think this necessitates a return to interpretivist measures and critical theory — which is the only branch of sociology that goes ahead already  presupposing the issues sociology finds itself in in the present."

Schizoid,fnevo7u,t3_g0rcmr,1586896724.0,"Yes. I don’t know the background besides Laing’s study into existentialist philosophy as to why he chose to frame the schizoid condition and psychosis in terms of the phenomenology of the schizoid experience, but there’s no other way to fully grasp SPD otherwise in my opinion. 

He makes a point about the nature of the schizoid condition being so difficult to understand for non schizoids because the insecurity in the schizoid’s being is tied up in the precarity of the rudimentary parts of their own self concept unlike the more ontologically secure person’s so that simple experiences take much different meaning and importance for schizoids."

sociology,fn0ymfq,t1_fn02wk0,1586551300.0,"That’s an interesting assertion on the regard of sociologists in society. Sociology was really only first formalized, say, around 1900 and developed until the middle of the decade in increasing importance only to rapidly decline in the latter half of the century and the turn towards post modernism in the humanities and stricter quantitative methods in the sciences."

You use a lot of chord fragments to stay melodic for your lead parts and your solos are tasty pentatonics.  I’d like to know who you mostly pull from and what records you learned the most from."
