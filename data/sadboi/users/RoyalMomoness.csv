BipolarReddit,fr465e2,t1_fr34hxo,1589877163.0,"This is my first time reading this sort of thread and I‚Äôm surprised that people are so evangelical about jumping on the anti-weed bandwagon. Weed has a lot of potentially bad side effects and needs to be used with caution, but so does most psychiatric meds. It also has a lot of potential benefits. Seroquel was a shitshow for me and there are plenty studies outlining harsh side effects, especially for off-label use, but people would get pushback for enthusiastically shouting that it‚Äôs the devil‚Äôs drug (and rightly so). Weed has never made me suicidal; plenty psychiatric drugs have, as per the possible side effects. Weed has never made me psychotic, but it‚Äôs triggered psychosis in others, as per the possible side effects. All these drugs mess with us, we individually have to figure out which ones are most beneficial. A lot of the studies people are citing about weed and depression refer to correlations that could be attributed to other factors - we should still take the info from those studies into consideration, but it‚Äôs not gospel. I‚Äôve found similarly negative info in studies on anti-psychotics and ssri‚Äôs. Writing off weed as a terrible drug for everybody is as shitty as writing off Abilify or Wellbutrin or Seroquel, imo. If it doesn‚Äôt work for you, don‚Äôt use it and share your experiences, but don‚Äôt get on a high horse about what works for other people. I also think all drugs can be used in different ways. If you‚Äôre popping ativan all day every day, you‚Äôre probably going to run into some issues. Same with weed. That doesn‚Äôt mean it should be written off as a possible therapy. My pdoc knows about my weed use, I keep careful track of my moods and the strains I use, and it works for me. If it doesn‚Äôt work for other people, cool, don‚Äôt use it."

Before that, I‚Äôd dropped out of college twice, somehow managed to scrape through a bachelors even though I had what I retrospectively recognize as an episode in my third year, attempted suicide when I was younger, and just been an all-round mess. The diagnosis changed my life. Not immediately though, it took about a year of meds and therapy before I felt stable. I‚Äôve been mostly functional since. Got a masters degree with a really good average (with accommodations), worked at jobs and even though I changed jobs frequently, I didn‚Äôt burn any bridges. I‚Äôve been married for 10 years and since the diagnosis, our relationship has reached new depths. We‚Äôre happy. I‚Äôve been happy. I‚Äôve had ups and downs, too, and I think the hardest thing is that in the middle of a down period, it feels like all I‚Äôve ever experienced is tainted by the darkness I feel in that moment. Like I will always feel unhappy and be unworthy and ‚Äúsick.‚Äù But my moments of stability have far outweighed the moments of depression and agitation, I haven‚Äôt had a full-blown manic episode in 5 years, and I think if I were to quantify the shitty vs happy days, the happy days win by far. And some days I actually feel like all the years of therapy and self-reflection needed to cope with bipolar has actually helped me deal better than other people with some challenges. In the beginning, it felt like the  diagnosis/illness defined me and would always define me, now it‚Äôs just something that‚Äôs there that I need to take care of, like asthma or eczema, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs my whole life.

I don‚Äôt think off-label psychotics should be a long-term solution. For insomnia I also tried and didn‚Äôt agree with tranzadone and later a psych prescribed an antihistamine called phenergan, which was one of the better options for me but made me groggy.

I prefer focusing on the behavior and trying to address that. And I think these things aren't black and white. I recently saw a doc that diagnosed me with OCD.

So I'm looking at those patterns and working to address them, even though I'm pretty sure I don't have OCD. If my doc says I'm BP1 with OCD, ok, cool, whatever. A good doctor is going to be learning about my history and symptoms from me and treating according to that, not according to the label.
