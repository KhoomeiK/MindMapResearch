nyc,fqe8sjw,t1_fqe3srn,1589303609.0,"You just illustrated exactly why the states need help from the federal government and should not, as Mitch McConnell suggests, 'go bankrupt'. That only means layoffs for firefighters and teachers etc. later on. Furthermore, NYS generates a lot of  tax revenue that ends up subsidizing states like Kentucky. We deserve to get some of that money back considering we're a densely populated hot spot. Send the funds where they're most needed. I wasn't a huge fan of Cuomo before this happened but I think he's handled this crisis well considering how inconsistent our federal government has been when providing aid.

Edit: Thought of something else. NY leads the nation in testing and our numbers are declining due to social distancing and mitigation measures. Other states are already lifting restrictions even though their numbers are rising. This was never going to be easy but had they done things differently it could've been a lot worse and I expect it will be for states that open up too soon."
