It is about a man who is stuck.  The people around him think he can do better.  He is burdened by his family name.  He decides to give into the voices of the people around him and make his financial life better by hook and crook.  The book shows the consequences of these actions.

I will say this re-watching there are a lot of bad episodes but just when you feel like giving up or doubting yourself an amazing episode shows up again.

You should feel very blessed for growing up in such a High School environment.  When I went to High School it was radically different.

I had no friends and did not fit in because I did not belong to a single subset.  You were either a stoner / computer / nerd / jock / etc.

I really feel like everyone was lost.  No one had a real identity and they were all just pretending to be someone.  

Also no one cared about anyone.  The teachers / administration / other students.  It really was still a 1950's mentality of you will figure life out.  Your parents are supposed to teach you everything.  

How you discovered culture was based on who your parents where or if you had older siblings.  There had to be an in because other than monolithic culture you sure as hell were not going to find it on your own.

I think that is the biggest change; the disappearance of monolithic culture.  You no longer have a single entity like MTV telling kids what is cool.  In my day if you did not watch MTV, I did not, you were out to sea in your own world.

westworld,fosqnwk,t3_g7esol,1588036053.0,"This whole season is beyond dumb and uncreative.  Here is why.

Rehoboam's point is to protect humanity.  Ok so that brings up the main issue of what does it mean to be human?  I mean that is the whole point of Westworld.

So how does Rehobam know what a human being is?  This is one of the biggest philosophical questions ever.  How do we know what something is?  How do we define it?

So there are two options:  1) Serac creates a definition of what a human being is.  But what can that definition be?  At the heart of it it has to be free will.  So by destroying free will Rehoboam is killing humanity so as an AI it would not take away people's free will because that would be illogical.

Even if all Serac said was create a program in which the most life forms live, there still would have to be a way to tell the computer who a human being is.  The point of a sentient AI is so you don't have to do this.  It can figure it out for itself.

So would the machine figure out who all of the human beings are?  how?  what are its criteria?

Finally, why wouldn't Rehoboam think of Dolores as a human being? Why wouldn't it conclude that Dolores is actually the perfect human being and kill all of the real people and replace them with hosts?

There are so many interesting philosophical issues and questions they could have covered and it has not touched any of this.  The way Rehoboam works makes no sense to me."

For example they try and build suspense by having Rey climbing a structure and oh my G-d she is going to fall.  Except a minute later she can fly.  

The final empire has ships that can blow up entire planets.  And they have like a million of them.  So why didn't they just blow up all of the planets?

In everything in this movie it is simultaneously the most deadly / destructive / all powerful thing in the universe and five seconds later it is defeated in the most idiotic way possible.

A damn spaceship was blown up by an arrow.

The acting is terrible.  I have no idea how or why anyone would care about any of these characters they are so one dimensional and wooden.

**Tennant** brings a different take on it.  He is an alien playing a human.  So there are just subtle things about his human behavior that are odd.

**Matt Smith** is an alien.  If a child were to draw or describe Doctor Who Matt Smith is what they would come up with.  

You never get the alien feel with Capaldi.  But at least with him he do get the time traveler feel.

The less I say about Whittaker the better.  What is missing from her acting is the subtle part.  She is terrible because she is trying to hard to be an alien.  You also do not get the Time Traveler vibe."

IAmA,fm8pmy9,t1_fm8mfde,1585853686.0,Wow what a rigid methodology.  So this entire thing is subjective.  You are not finding weirdos you are finding people who you think are weird and weird on the outside not the inside.  Do you have any objective classification at all?  How do you control for confirmation bias?  How do you know they are actually different?
IAmA,fm8bzbb,t3_fto06v,1585846609.0,"How do you differentiate between someone being ""weird"" and someone having genuine, pathological / psychological problems?  I find the biggest problem is that society just lumps both categories together.  Also what is your methodology for finding someone weird since someone can fake that.  (A lot of people pretend to be weird because it is cool)."

Music,flwdh5f,t3_fre1jf,1585546917.0,Who else cannot go to sleep and is just listening to his first album John Prine?  Everytime I see the tracklist for that album I am still blown away.   If all he ever wrote was that album he would still be one of the greatest songwriters ever. To me he is the greatest songwriter ever.  In 4 minutes he creates an entire universe.  I just wish more people knew about him.  Come on John I don't want to play Souvenirs tomorrow.

I think the Grapes of Wrath is really difficult for a modern audience because we just cannot relate to it.   

I think the best way to get introduced to Steinbeck is to fall in love with his language.  Get a copy of East of Eden, randomly turn to any page, and read it.  Ignore the plot and just inhale the words."

All three Doctors before him there was something Alien about them.  Capaldi never had that for me. 

But I will say Capaldi was 100% necessary.  He represents growing up.  I think that is why I do not like him, I just do not want to grow up.

I also was not a fan of Bill Pots."

But I dont know if I would ascribe Denial to the 9th Doctor.  He is fully aware of the danger.  His Dalek's are the most dangerous and he never sugar coats it.  I think what I associate most with him is Justice."
doctorwho,fl8dpif,t1_fl7m5bi,1584921341.0,Have fun.  I would say slow down and cherish each episode.  The end of Matt Smith for most is the end of Doctor Who.
doctorwho,fl7gp5z,t1_fl6jlj2,1584901363.0,Capaldi is who the Doctor inevitably would become and I hate him for that.  I want the Doctor to stay like the goofball Matt Smith was or with the hope and optimism of Tennant.  The nonchalance of Eccleston.
doctorwho,fl7gi79,t1_fl6julr,1584901248.0,Yes the range of emotions.  The secret to playing the Doctor as an actor is you have to do the opposite emotion a normal person would do- laugh when you should cry.  Smile when you should be scared.  But it needs to be subtle.  There needs to be something just off.
doctorwho,fl7gamb,t1_fl6k5jl,1584901125.0,Smith is the most alien of them all.  He is the best representation of Doctor Who as your imaginary friend.
doctorwho,fl7g7zu,t1_fl6l1gm,1584901081.0,"Exactly.  First the problem is the change from Matt Smith to Capaldi is so shocking.  They are so radically different.  They really needed a transitional Doctor.  

They just went way too much on the anger side and lost the fun of the Doctor.  But I think they started to figure it out.  

One of the main problems with Capaldi is his connection to his companions.  The age difference between him and Clara was just too much / their relationship was just too weird.  I could not relate at all to Bill she was just annoying.

But there are some amazing episodes in the Capaldi seasons.  He is an amazing actor though."

doctorwho,fl638uj,t1_fl62wkz,1584853031.0,"Well then they got it correct because that is what you are supposed to feel but us adults imaginations are kind of broken.  

What I wouldn't give to see Doctor Who from a child's perspective.  Doctor Who at its heart is a children's story.  It is a story about Childhood.  The stories are like what would happen you let a child's imagination go free and let them create a universe.  That is why the monsters look so amateur.  

That is why there are so many stories about childhood fears.  

That is also what is missing from Capaldi and the new Doctor.  They forgot or never understood everything I previously said."
doctorwho,fl62uib,t1_fl5oyms,1584852673.0,True. But I think there is also a benefit to having so many possibilities already eliminated.  It gives you something to laser focus on.  But the new doctor is just terrible.  Like Chris Chibnall could have a lifetime and he still could never write a single episode as good as any in Eccleston's run.
doctorwho,fl62kd3,t1_fl5p31r,1584852428.0,"Vincent and the Doctor makes me cry everytime.  If you want to really cry listen to **Vincent by** Don McLean and watch the episode.

It's funny because what I love most about Eccleston's run is how dated it is.  I love the public access feel of his doctor.  For me Doctor who is a children's story.  It is about Childhood.  About the imagination of children.  And children's art is always rough and weird but that is why it is so wonderful.  

I hate the new Doctor Who because all they focus on is special effects and graphics."
doctorwho,fl626p0,t1_fl5pd4x,1584852100.0,Yeah.  He is the most childlike.  He was a perfect casting decision.
