I'm blessed to say, I'm the youngest in my family (28 going on to 29 in 2 months) with no kids. I have never been married but I'm also very skeptical about it due to my fair share of experiences of others. The divorce rate is all time high! as well as single parents and split house holds. Seen my Bestfriend dodge a bullet and waste $30k in a wedding that was called off few months before. 10 Year relationship of my cousin that left him homeless. Worst of all, a couple that stayed together because of ""the kids"", which I think that is so horrible mentally. I'm happy to say, I might want kids or have that marriage status but only the future can tell.
