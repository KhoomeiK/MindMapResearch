Okay so I just watched the Gabriel Hernandez series..  I know your situation isn‚Äôt as bad..but I really feel like you should reach out and at least get a paper trail going.

Not saying your father would do such a thing, but the slightest accident is all it takes for you to stop breathing. Think about you and your siblings safety as well. 

Has your mother ever been abused by your father? I only ask since she may be afraid as well. And if she has, try talking to her when your father isn‚Äôt around to see if she could help get out of an environment like that. It‚Äôs scary.. I just really don‚Äôt want you or anyone else to get hurt.

I guess everyone is irresponsible at this point."
soundcloud,fg80ss8,t1_fg7cnt0,1580606483.0,May have to do w/ the algorithm or data they get from listeners and decided to monetize it. Do you know the artist? And have you tried checking if another page made a separate upload of the songs for free?

soundcloud,fg77cig,t3_examz6,1580585702.0,A lot of mainstream artists have this. You need one of the subscriptions to stream the songs that have the Go+ icon I think.

Castlecrush,fg76t0q,t1_fg759ri,1580585344.0,"Let me try again. For example. If you:

1). Start a match spamming ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù or ‚Äúgood game‚Äù - I spam just before the win and leave. 

2). If you almost won and started spamming toward end game.. and I turn the game around? I‚Äôm definitely spamming until they leave the match.

All I do is match their actions. Most games I win, I don‚Äôt even say anything if you don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs always mutual."
Castlecrush,fg73olu,t1_fg6ttlq,1580583253.0,"Tell that to the people who start the match spamming ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù and the Genie/Jester sticker every time I throw a card.

Plus, I never do it until I win.  That, or if they stop spamming after they realize the play was a setup lol."
badroommates,fg6a4yf,t1_fg69kql,1580561039.0,Yeah I‚Äôm trying to find the same style and size that‚Äôs cheaper and still authentic. They were gifted by my mom when they first released. I‚Äôm not materialistic so these are my only pair. Wish these weren‚Äôt so expensive! I don‚Äôt get it lol.
badroommates,fg69b8d,t3_ex57e7,1580560022.0,"The details are a bit too lengthy. So feel free to ask questions! Some basic info is:

-Air Jordan 1 mid

-Can‚Äôt find a pair cheaper than $188.82 (that‚Äôs w/ tax and shipping) in the same size and style. 

-Nike support team said they have my pair. And size. And style..... in Barcelona for 165‚Ç¨

How would I even calculate the cost to replace them?"
