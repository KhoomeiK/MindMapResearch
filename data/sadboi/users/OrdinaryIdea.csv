mentalhealth,fpl162k,t3_ge1dz0,1588704554.0,"This show came out during a time I was suicidal, dealing with my anxiety disorder, and battling severe depression. I was having panic attacks everyday. I knew that it showed a suicide and I refused to watch it because a lot of my anxiety revolved around me having suicidal thoughts. Everyday at school people would talk about it and it triggered a panic attack every time. FUCK this show."
AskWomen,foma29j,t3_g81fjr,1587882872.0,"Strap in, this is a rollercoaster. I met my now husband my freshman year of high school. He was my (then) boyfriend‚Äôs best friend, my husband was also dating another girl at the time. We were all friends, but when my boyfriend cheated on me and left me for someone else I stayed close friends with my husband and the girl he was dating at the time. 
        So here I am, best friends with my ex-boyfriends ex-best friend and his girlfriend. I had always thought my husband was handsome but since he was in a relationship I never acted on it and respected them together. Then they asked me to have a threesome with them. I‚Äôm bisexual and so was his gf. We were young and horny. It was every young mans dream. So we did it, multiple times over the course of a few months.
         Eventually, their relationship became toxic. They broke up, and 2 weeks later my husband asked me out on a date. We dated for a month, the other girl threatened to kill her self if they didn‚Äôt get back together and he left me for her. I didn‚Äôt speak to either of them after that, but they only lasted a month or two more. A year later I run into him and he asked me out again. The rest is history. Apparently he always had a thing for me but thought I wasn‚Äôt interested and never said a word."
mentalhealth,fnrqvwl,t1_fnrphlf,1587198175.0,"I would start off with asking how she‚Äôs actually feeling. This sounds cliche, but it‚Äôs better than asking ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù. If she keeps persistently denying that nothing is wrong, keep ‚Äúpushing‚Äù but very lightly. Reassure her you‚Äôre trying to understand her to be able to help her. If she does open up remember she most likely doesn‚Äôt want advice on how to feel better rather than you just being there to listen to her feelings. It‚Äôs also okay to ask her questions when you feel it‚Äôs appropriate or you genuinely want to know more about what she‚Äôs talking about. As far as talking points: Ask her what you can do that day to help her out. Ask her what you can do in general to help her. Ask her if she wants to go on a walk to clear her head or anything where she is being productive. It‚Äôs important to remember it‚Äôs the small things that can make a huge difference. My husband has done so well with comforting me when I‚Äôm down. A lot of my advice is from the things he has done that made me feel a lot better. If you need anything else feel free to message me, I hope this helped."
mentalhealth,fnrmata,t3_g3i7v5,1587193567.0,"As a person who struggles with both anxiety and depression, I 100% understand what she is going through. First I want to say thank you, thank you for caring so much about her and wanting to seek help on how to help her. She may be denying that something is wrong, but you need to try to get her to open up very carefully. Second, you have to understand that only she can drag herself out of the hole she is in. The good news is you can be the steps on the latter she climbs out of that hole with. Never stop showing her how much you love her no matter how tired and sad she is feeling at that moment. A simple I love you, a simple kiss on the forehead can be the best part of her day whether she shows it or not. I would tell her you know she isn‚Äôt feeling well, and that she can talk to you about anything. Sometimes depressed people won‚Äôt talk about what they are feeling because they feel isolated. Let her know you know how she is feeling and that you do want to help her and ask her what you can do to help her."

What you have said gives me a place to start, so thank you again. And thank you for your wisdom."
