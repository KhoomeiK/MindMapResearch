datingoverthirty,fmefy3e,t1_fmed1qu,1586002567.0,"Thank you for the advice! Being self aware is the starting point for me!! I am going to start working more on myself and what makes me happy! I feel like overtime outside things can make us have these thoughts, I.e., others cruel and unwarranted comments; but we have to be bigger than them and be vulnerable to life. The ebbs and flows. And have our ‚Äútoolbox‚Äù to adapt accordingly."
datingoverthirty,fmda23b,t1_fmcv6oq,1585962760.0,I think the fact people can be vulnerable is rare thing in itself.
datingoverthirty,fmd9ymb,t1_fmcjc6w,1585962694.0,"Being self aware is so key. I started to notice the feelings I have for someone aren‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúme‚Äù or invalid, they are just there. Over time, if you notice that the person doesn‚Äôt make you feel what you‚Äôre giving is being reciprocated, then you should expect it‚Äôs going to be that way in the long-term. I think it presents evidence how heartless some are - to keep stringing you along, with constant judgement because you are emotional. It is ok to be emotional and express yourself. The right person will understand."
