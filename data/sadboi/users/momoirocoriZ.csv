tumblr,fqxcyfr,t3_gl82z3,1589730174.0,"I work the front desk and phones at a hospital surgery clinic with an aging, hard-of-hearing patient population. My managers refuse to modify our tasks for the current situation, so my day is a constant tug of war between hearing ""hUH?? I can't HEAR you???"" in my ear, moving my mask so phone patient can understand me, and then fielding (justified) dirty looks from immunocompromised patients in my waiting room.

These patients then complain to my boss about me moving my mask. Or about me shouting into the phone when I don't move my mask. 

Then my managers reprimand me for moving my mask PLUS not answering the phones enough (we're down front desk staff bc they tested positive üòê).

terracehouse,fjy3cs5,t1_fjxpxiv,1583689004.0,"WHEW ok,  this. Thank you - I was feeling outnumbered for a while based on the podcasts I listen to LMAO. 

My two cents is that Emika seems cool and socially savvy (teach me your ways, queen!!), so I'm willing to bet she could absolutely tell that her actions were grating on Hana. Hana is not subtle. I'm reading two possible situations here:

1) *Emi fancies Ryo and is simply pursuing him in her own way, Hana's feelings be damned*. Honestly, this is fine - all's fair in love and war and all that - but this means that Hana's low blows are also fair game.

2) *Emi doesn't fancy Ryo like that but enjoys attention from him, Hana's feelings be damned*. I have a hard time imagining that Emika wouldn't know how her actions might come across to someone like Hana, so this possibility tracks closer to deliberate ""I just don't like or care about you"" dismissal. Again, this is FINE, and again, Hana's low blows still seem in-bounds to me.

Basically, Emika's ""I-thought-we-were-friends-and-now-I'm-being-attacked-for-no-reason"" attitude just comes across as manipulative to me rather than sympathetic in this case.

(Edited for clarity and spelling)"
