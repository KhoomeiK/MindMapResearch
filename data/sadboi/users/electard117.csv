I never have much to say that others haven’t already said. Still, I wish you some peace and good fortune. Dealing with intense pain that is non visible to others is uniquely tough. 

I’m not going to approve your husbands behavior but it sounds like he may be responding to it in his own super unhealthy manner. Perhaps a true honest discussion would be helpful. You two are after all supposed to love and support one another. If you can come together as a team, I would be you both find more happiness 

Best wishes"
