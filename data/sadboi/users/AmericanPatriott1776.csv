Fucking dumbass, it took the US 3 weeks to complete the same amount of tests that S.Korea had done in just the first week of the virus. Maybe we'd be able to do that if Trump took the virus more seriously. You cannot seriously sit here and tell me that the U.S has had a sufficient response when we have the most amount of deaths and cases in the ENTIRE WORLD.

Also have you considered that the reason a majority of the population isn’t into raiding, is because raiding is actually *difficult* in Retail? Everybody and their mom raids in classic because raiding is extremely accessible and easy, the same can’t be said for retail. Just a thought though. Oh and btw, you’re kind of implying that retail is somehow *lesser* than classic because it’s “a mount collecting sim” while it’s only really a mount collecting sim if your bad and can’t get into higher level  raids/keys or push rating in arena. 

Don’t act like you weren’t being a passive aggressive ledditor by digging through my post history and accusing me of being a “retail player just trying to find reasons to get butthurt” for disagreeing with you.

If you’d like, we can talk more about some of these cognitive biases so you don’t come onto reddit looking like a complete fucking moron who thinks spamming frostbolt is somehow more difficult than the average retail class.
