first thing, I'm trying to offer an effective way to avoid those conflicts with their parents. So I'm just offering suggestions so that they can avoid said ""treatment"".

second, sometimes you can't and you shouldn't try to control how people think of you or react to what you do.

it's hard to help you figure out why your parents are so critical of you without knowing more about you and them, etc but they probably don't know how much it bothers you that they react like that. you can try asking them to be less critical of how you do things and let them know how it makes you feel about yourself

In fact, they're probably much worse. Even if we're talking about forests that are exploited.

IMO, it comes down to the huge demand in trees. You can't just tell people in the industry not to cut those trees. They're just providing other companies that require the ressources. If Canada doesn't, it's going to be another country. And there's a huge demand, because there's an even bigger population.

And you can't just cut those trees without destroying the ecosystem of those forests. People aren't going to revert back to just using axes and small trucks or horses. And even that damages the ecosystem (just not as much or as fast)

The gas, which traps heat in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, has been increasing since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood for energy and is continuing to reach concentrations not seen in at least 500,000 years. The impacts of climate change include global warming, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and sea ice as well as more severe weather events.

If people wanted to make a real difference, we would have to take more radical actions. Real, serious and honest change isn't going to happen quickly just by organising protests. Those protests also would need to be more disruptive.

Also, there's no doubt researching and offering better and greener technology as an attractive alternative to the more polluting and widespread  technologies is essential to resolving this crisis.

However, there are other factors getting in the way of either reducing pollution by changing habits or legislation (to force and speed up the phasing out of polluting technology). The former could be solved with education, partly through protests I imagine. But, as long as our politicians still don't take a more common and serious stance on climate change, I believe a lot of the people will remain skeptical. I suspect that politician's opinions are still swayed by powerful, wealthy influential companies. Not all countries face the same hurdles when trying to achieve policies to fight climate change."

congrats on not doing it for a week. believe in yourself. if you can do a day without, you can do a week without. if you can do a week without, you can do a month. etc

things don't always need to make sense. that's just how you feel

 if it's something you use specifically for that then you should really throw it."

SuicideWatch,f1opaal,t3_dabwxi,1569655706.0,"dude, I have a friend who never had a gf and he's 30 year old. he hasn't killed himself and I'm 100% sure he never thought of it.

honestly, an escort is not necessarily a bad idea if you've never had any experience (if you're old enough for that). it'll give you some experience and fun. be picky if you do that with the woman ofc.

you can always work on yourself and get better with women. and your own state of mind makes a huge difference on how well you do."

why do you want more than one Gundam tattoo tho"

 get rid of rasors and anything you'd use to cut yourself."

linux,f1n5979,t1_f1mrz26,1569609286.0,"well... when I say: ""I don't agree"" I mean: I do not agree with them doing it. üôÑ

I wasn't skeptical that they ""spy on people""."
linux,f1m9zf8,t1_f1m3o0h,1569588776.0,I hope eventually I'll try a Linux distro that suits me so that I can pretty much ditch Windows. it's not really an easy transfer to do.
linux,f1m9oic,t1_f1m7392,1569588534.0,"well, nice to know you have a good attitude. 

while I don't agree with them ""spying"" on people or doing shady things behind the doors, I've been using Windows since forever and it's been serving me well. It also offers many more things than any Linux OS does.

You still can't deny  that Mac OS and Windows are doing certain things better and Linux OS isn't just superior in every way.

I would like to migrate to some Linux OS but it is sadly not so simple."
linux,f1lm6ss,t1_f1llhr4,1569559002.0,"""good enough""? Windows is pretty amazing in general. I guess one could argue Apple kind of does it better but at a steep price.

also .. did you vote me down? lol üòí"
linux,f1ljz4r,t1_f1liaqx,1569556882.0,"I thought the philosophy behind it was open source and free?

Also, I'm not sure what purpose that serves other than programmers/computer scientists/etc

I guess it's good if you specifically want to build a Linux for a specific machine, for a specific purpose and deploy it on several copies of those machines."
linux,f1lhl2w,t1_f1lh2md,1569555022.0,it definitely has a ton of flexibility which is awesome. you can basically do what you want with it right?

linux,f1lf88n,t3_d9u8ym,1569553201.0,"that's one of the things I dislike about Linux. 

Like it's something bad to want an OS that just works ""out of the box"" and allows you to use your computer without any hassle.

might be a stereotype, but seems like a lot of people enjoy the fact that it's harder to use, like it's a good thing. I'm probably wrong in thinking that though."

idk what it is about you guys on this damn subreddit!"
