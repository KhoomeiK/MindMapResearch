At the moment we can only have our three member of kitchen staff on very low hours to fulfil any take away orders (very little). Our building is privately owned (not by us), so the government cannot help in our rent. It doesn't look like we are in line for any benifits. I've been with the family run business for 3years, almost since it opened, but, I know I won't be getting paid, unless I ask for holiday pay. What is worse, it that I don't know if our little female owned and run, plant-based, culture hub is going to survive."
AskReddit,fkwrmqy,t3_fksy04,1584602866.0,"Okay, this isn't scary. But it's weird and a little creepy I guess. So, a couple of years ago Im working in a bar, I finished my shift around midnight and start walking home, I see a taxi at the taxi stand and decide to use it, as I'd been paid that night. Its summer, so I've got the window open (it opens horizontally, the taxis like a mini van) and I'm sitting right next to it. Next thing I know, there is movement in the back, I look to the seats behind me, thinking that one of the head rests had fallen, but, I can't see that anything's changed. I look down to the seat next to me, and there is an egg. An egg had just appeared next to me. I picked it up and asked the driver if he knew anything about the egg. Ofcourse, he was confused as to what the heck I was saying about an egg. I told him it had just appeared and must have come through the window. He proceeded to take it from me and smash it in his hand, it wasn't fake or boiled, so he got raw egg all over himself. We pulled up to a petrol station and I went and got him tissues. It was the weirdest thing ever, I'm sure the taxi driver thought it was me and that I had tried to prank him or something. But, it wasn't my egg, and I still wonder how it got in the car. It must have been thrown, come through the window and somehow survived the impact."

When I was little, around Christmas time, a santa clause would drive a float around the town and neighboring towns, with his elves, who would knock on the doors and collect money for a children's charity. When I was older, I was working in a coffee shop, and I met santa! The man who was dressing up and visiting all the children in all the neighborhood every Christmas...he told me that far far more donations came from the poorer areas."
depression,f9jgvm9,t3_dzrccf,1575373769.0,"I (25F) am in such a dull position with this right now. I've been seeing a guy (33M) for 7 months, who is emotionally intelligent and who hears me when I speak about my depression. He is patient and supportive, but he is emotionally unavailable himself. He doesn't have time or space in this life to invest in me emotionally, which leaves an unbalanced and confusing exchange. So, we have decided we are going to have to stop seeing eachother, at least, romantically. Its really fucking with me, because, even though I'm the person who has decided to end it, I still feel as though Im the one who's been rejected, because, I've exposed myself emotionally and it's not been reciprocated. Its not his fault, it's not my fault. Either way, I've spend the last two days on the sofa or in bed."
