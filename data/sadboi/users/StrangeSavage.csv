datingoverthirty,evqwqit,t1_evqs4ww,1564698432.0,">	I think it's also worthwhile to ask yourself the question of why you want to be in a relationship. If your primary motivation is ""not looking like a loser"" then you're going to have a bad time. I know this, because that was my motivation for many years and I had a very bad time.

I want a family of my own, I have a decent job, my carreer is going alright, I own a home, a car, my social circle is decent for an introvert like me, but like I said, almost everyone decided to move away when they found their significant other. I used to have platonic friendships with girls but I feel I've always been treated like the gay friend/confident we see in tv shows, girls feel at ease around me, just not romantically interested at all. I got invitations from them but never as a date. 

I want to have someone who shares my hobbies, who loves me for the soft hearted guy i am, someone to support and vice-versa, a teammate to go on my daily life, having kids would be cherry on top. Loneliness is also killing me, I've seen 4 different psychiatrist and all agreed that seeing someone would bring a dynamic that would help a ton in my daily routine, especially for motivation. Im not asking for a girl to save me, i crave connections and I'll be honest on the fact that never getting to experience a relationship is a terrifying idea. 

I really don't want to hear ""you don't need a gf to be happy! go be a monk!"" 

The few dates i had made me more alive and excited than anyone could imagine, just traveling to her town made me feel like my heart was beating again, no hobby no matter how fun manage to make me feel this much happiness. 

I feel behind the line, the statistics show 98% of mens lose their virginity before 21, which means they at least dated, made mistakes (or not), managed to find out what they look for in a partner, etc. I'm 28 and the most intimate ive ever been with a woman was with a hug, which understandably makes me look socially retarded (autism, social anxiety, which im not afflicted with) and I dont struggle at eyes contact.

The talks and activities go fine... but like I've said a lot earlier, I can't catch their attention if I want to go beyond platonic friendship, im not particularly manly or have interest in sports, cars, repairing everything with my own hands, etc. It made me feel extremely uncomfortable about my body and everyone reassures me im not a bad looker at all.

I've been losing hair for years, my sex drive went to zero as i started antidepressants and im not sure when ill be able to stop taking them. 

Went on longer than expected, thx for the support."

I have two but they're both living 4+ hours away from my city, I keep contact through facebook.

One of them only gets friendly with mens (tomboy who had it extremely rough at school) and the other is married to another one of my friend (lucky one :/ ) They never found someone to match me with... and I've asked often.

I could send you a PM later, I have a fb account so you can see how far i am behind the competition. 

thanks for your help :)"

This so much.

Anytime I would post in /r/lonely, /r/depression or /r/foreveralone 

The only reason im still single to this day is because I'm a terrible human being and should be condemned to an eternity of suffering. Yeah, people on reddit go straight to assume the worst about everyone."

patientgamers,eu2znj7,t1_ettragu,1563401826.0,"I remember having the same issue and quitting after losing a very large amount of the currency we need for essential items, upgrades, etc.

In Dark Souls, its pretty easy to farm if you want to make the challenge less intimidating, which isn't the same unfortunately in Hollow Knight.

The difficulty in Celeste spoiled me, there are some very rough parts but the game has multiple custom options to adapt the challenge. 

I wished I loved Hollow Knight but I ended up moving to another game."
