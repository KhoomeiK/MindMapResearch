Anxiety,fqyrnj0,t1_fqwaeos,1589753421.0,"Yea, no worries. I had been seeing a psychiatrist for a few years. I told him at one point I wanted to taper off. I have been taking 1mg in the morning, .5mg in the afternoon, and 1mg at night. So, 2.5mg a day. He only prescribed me 2 week refills.

I have a history of addiction issues with pharmaceuticals (my late mother, and late uncle). This is why I wanted to limit my refills to 1x every 2 weeks. He never tried to completely weed me off the drug. He left the practice, so I'm seeing someone else there. She gave me a full months supply for the first time in a year. 

Benzos relax the heck out of me. They are the miracle drug for me. Here or there throughout the prescription cycle, I would increase my dosage by a bit. I was several days away from my next refill, and I ran out several days early. I started feeling some standard withdrawal symptoms, but last night, I was having some weird nervous system issues. It's hard to explain what I was feeling, but it was like a dull headache and the feeling of a potential seizure. I just feel weird - hard to explain. I was looking at withdrawal symptoms and I saw seizures and death. 

TL;DR I ran out early because I am addicted to the feeling of complete calmness. I increased my dosage, but didn't have enough pills to keep up, so I ran out early.

/u/chitownkidd23 seems like you're doing it the right way. Klonopins are fine, so are xanaxes, but I take them every day and not as needed."

If Conor, DC, JBJ, Nunes, Feg, Izzy, Bobby, etc. etc. etc. It works well in other sports. The NBA has a great player's association, for example.

As a side note, I think the UFC can do a much better job marketing themselves and the fighters. If they can't market the fighters better, then the fighters should be able to market themselves. I'm sure they do, but I'd imagine they can only do so much.

I don't know, but if I owned the UFC I'd definitely have a much more refined product by now. The UFC right now isn't much different from the 1st true iteration of the sport (I'm not talking UFC 1 here). The presentation hasn't really evolved much. The skills and strategies of the fighters have which I think is why the UFC is as popular as it is. It's the most interesting sport in my opinion."
