seduction,fr1am8p,t3_gm38v9,1589816345.0,I think you are just worrying a bit. If u think you’ve put on weight have u weighed yourself? Did u know what u was before. I know what it feels like to obsess over things. But DO NOT overthink. If she wants to see u again go with the flow. Be the same person u was before. That’s what she liked. It’s not like you have changed completely and she’s gonna be like wtf. She won’t even notice. I can barely see any difference. If u do wanna lose weight maybe try switching over to only drinking water if u don’t already I lost a lot of weight like that
seduction,fr1a8e7,t3_glunf6,1589816146.0,What app was connected to snap?
Dreadlocks,fquqgbp,t1_fquq6dy,1589663010.0,Ok. So does a deep clean depend on how much mature they are? Or will it effect the maturing process
Dreadlocks,fqukvfn,t1_fqujygv,1589660547.0,Why does hair type matter with deep clean anyway? Just wondering
Dreadlocks,fqugcu5,t1_fqortle,1589658524.0,Nobody cares really. Not doing anyone any harm to get more opinionated replies
Dreadlocks,fqug0dd,t3_gknxa3,1589658327.0,If u want brush them out. Don’t cut them so u still get as much length as possible.
Dreadlocks,fquftwb,t3_gku0xy,1589658222.0,Durag?
Dreadlocks,fqtd76u,t1_fqtb7zn,1589636523.0,Yeah I’ve got a kit thing I’ve brought I just don’t know if there’s a good or bad time to use it
seduction,fqt904r,t3_gksw65,1589633495.0,Thank you so much
Dreadlocks,fqt6uyi,t1_fqt5uwj,1589631780.0,Umm tbh I don’t know the exact number and stuff but I’m white so it’s straight but I have thick kinda wirey and fairly curly hair

dating_advice,fqiz6ym,t3_gj7f01,1589402879.0,*i have gave her a few opportunities to fully let me know and tell me if it’s more. I’ve asked her if she still wants to see me and still likes me and she says yes so. I don’t know how everything can be thrown away within a day. The last time we hung out she was taking pics of me calling me “my boy” sending it to her friend. When I went home saying how she wishes I was still there and I can stay over after all this lockdown. And now she needs to think? I hope it’s just everything pilling on top of her with her mom etc. She hasn’t deleted any chats or comments or anything. I’m literally so confused.

Anxiety,fq9c43b,t1_fq87eur,1589193202.0,Thanks man. I’ve always been shy and anxious so find a lot of it awkward but. Also dw like atleast you’ve done it.
Anxiety,fq9bz64,t1_fq7wapd,1589193056.0,Woww thank you so much I already know that next time I’ll be a lot more relaxed and hope it can go further. Thanks for your experience
Anxiety,fq6veef,t1_fq6niji,1589138341.0,Thank you very much. Appreciate it
Anxiety,fq6jjgf,t1_fq6ii6q,1589132749.0,Ahhhh. Ok thank you. Genuinely thanks for your insight
Anxiety,fq6dwtg,t1_fq685gh,1589129640.0,Haha thanks. That’s what I was thinking. So great to hear it. I kinda can’t wait till it just gets easier and easier and more comfortable
Anxiety,fq6dttw,t1_fq65pkj,1589129597.0,"What do you mean by the last bit. Character pretty static? Lol
But yeah thanks so much. I guess if it’s totally normal I’m happy with that. And it will just get easier"
Anxiety,fq6do4f,t1_fq64lts,1589129511.0,Thank you so much. Again I think it was just nerves. But then because I felt kinda embarrassed just wanted some opinions. Again thanks a lot for ur insight
Anxiety,fq5zrsd,t1_fq5zlwc,1589121439.0,Thanks man. Tbh the girl is very supportive made me feel very comfortable and assured me it’s actually normal and people she’s been with has happened before. She was glad that I overcame the first steps. I think it was just all nerves but Yh.
dating_advice,fq4jghr,t1_fq4bcx7,1589078541.0,Sorry thought this was on a different question haha
dating_advice,fq4jai4,t3_ggs92y,1589078479.0,Meant not get an erection
dating_advice,fq4cay3,t1_fq4bzi1,1589075955.0,Beta as in alpha and beta. Alpha would be like that strong “man” you know that typical figure. Beta would be more like pussy or baby ish. And yeah u can she made me really comfortable when I had no idea what I was doing really
dating_advice,fq4c2s9,t1_fq4bcx7,1589075878.0,Nah she’s not. I’m 20 she’s 18. We made out and I fingered her. Just couldn’t get hard. Was just nerves I think. She said she enjoyed it and stuff so. And like I said she’s really supportive so that’s great. She didn’t touch me or anything and the position I struggled to even get down to her. Like I had to kinda lift her legs which was just more trouble added on
dating_advice,fq4br7r,t1_fq4avss,1589075772.0,Ok thanks.
dating_advice,fq4bpdq,t1_fq4awm3,1589075756.0,Yh she does. I think maybe it might help me by her touching me. And Yh she was nervous. She said she enjoyed it. But Yh I just don’t wanna feel like a “beta” as everyone goes on about lmao
dating_advice,fq4a7e0,t1_fq48e63,1589075233.0,20. My first time literally doing anything. We kissed and I fingered her. Tried to do more but just couldn’t. She could tell and is really supportive. She was enjoying it but then yeah we sort of just stopped and then chilled it wasn’t particularly awkward I just felt weird
dating_advice,fq28i0z,t3_ggkwel,1589053784.0,Tbh I’m not 100% but maybe just bring stuff up in the movie? Or maybe if anything in the movie reminds you of something. I noticed that when I was overthinking what to say it actually blocked my mind from thoughts. Just say whatever comes to your mind (obviously if it seems interesting or something to actually talk about) and try not to think “this or that”
dating_advice,fpzvwdq,t1_fpzusbt,1589024457.0,Ok thanks a lot. It’s weird cus I’ve never really been in that situation before. And I just kinda didn’t feel ready but like we were hanging out and I had my hand on her thigh and she was like that’s a turn on spot. I felt kinda ready but also a bit unsure and I’m very protective over myself and stuff so won’t do things unless I’m certain. Now I kinda regret it tho and wish I just went through with it lmao.
Anxiety,fpw94yo,t1_fpw78bo,1588959383.0,Yesss thank you man 💙
Anxiety,fpw6lhr,t1_fpw6783,1588958148.0,Yh I get what u saying. Dw tho I’m defo not over my head or anything I’m very protective of my self. Just tryna clear my head. I like her and we’ve been speaking for like 2 months. I’m not gonna back down but neither go any faster. Cus that’s what I’ve been doing just chilling. She not alll over me either it’s just she does say she really likes me. I think she just has had a lot of shit so clings onto slight happiness etc. I’ll just carry on chilling and see how it goes
Anxiety,fpw3twz,t1_fpw3745,1588956780.0,What do you mean by projecting? Sorry lol I’m just tryna get a view and stuff and tryna clear my head. I reallly fucking like her and she been so understanding in situations.
Anxiety,fpw1e9e,t1_fpw0uy6,1588955567.0,Hmm Yh she’s told me a lot about her life. Literally apparently everyone guy she’s had has fucked her over and her dad and shit. But also like she’s being slow at replying which makes sense if terms of she’s at hospital so can’t text back quick. So that’s making me think if she wanted attention she would be replying quick but then again she could be wanted me to be craving her so
Anxiety,fpw0amq,t3_gfw343,1588955018.0,Like also I seen her snapchat list of friends. and I was that number 1 friend thing the other ones were just her girl friends and stuff so
Dreadlocks,fpvgyac,t3_gfcbxh,1588944538.0,I don’t see how they would be too far off his. In terms of style just have short dreads and side bun some and leave the others. But the texture will just be different
Dreadlocks,fpojvhm,t1_fpocw4c,1588785729.0,Ay your dreads sick tho anyway
Dreadlocks,fpo6af9,t3_ge6j74,1588779120.0,Swear there’s something up with my dreads. Had them about 9 months and still don’t look as floppy as yours and others. I do have thick hair and slightly wavy but
Dreadlocks,fpo64om,t3_gejmsy,1588779039.0,Yh my roots are loooooose and it’s annoying asf. I’ve noticed after my last wash however a lot of them have twisted and almost started coming into the dread themselves. I have one thin dread tho and the root is now obviously loose and like splitting of that makes sense and it gives me anxiety that it’s gonna break even tho the same amount of hairs are still in it. It just feels thinner
Dreadlocks,fpo5hu7,t3_gekub1,1588778725.0,Remind me of Carti a bit. Fire bro
Dreadlocks,fph7k8p,t1_fpd5f2z,1588616360.0,Just ordered some aswell as a deep clean set. Thanks for the recommendation
Dreadlocks,fpg4jik,t1_fpg3ucl,1588594027.0,Ok cool thanks. I use dreads Ik shampoo atm which is good imo
Dreadlocks,fpdku5r,t1_fpd5f2z,1588528970.0,Great thanks very much
Dreadlocks,fpd4aad,t1_fpd13qy,1588519529.0,Ooo ok thanks. Yh I’m really looking for something to help with moisture and dry itchy scalp.

Anxiety,fpb5ql8,t1_fpb3ku0,1588462676.0,Damnnn hope you okay and dealing okay. I defo don’t get it that bad. I do like little things like overthink and obsess. And then Yh a few other things and that shaky thing. I just find it weird I’m like wait I’m shaking and just can’t stop it
Dreadlocks,fpaq3av,t1_fpanyxm,1588453357.0,Ok thanks for the insight. I’ll take more of a look around. And decide. Thanks again
Anxiety,fpam4zb,t1_fpalzs7,1588451005.0,Yh I get sweaty aswell but I swear my skin or anything doesn’t actually feel cold it’s so weird and I never even thought about it being anxiety before
Anxiety,fpaktta,t1_fpaj8ez,1588450235.0,Do you get it like in your arms and literally like your body? My legs or anything are fine just around my chest muscles and stomach and arms

piercing,fp316sm,t1_fp30khm,1588271334.0,"Shit I’ve been twisting it like hell. Yes first piercing 
Stud and titanium"
Dreadlocks,fp2j388,t3_gaxd6m,1588262624.0,I don’t even get how two strand twists can form dreads or whatever. Sorry I’m not help. I need educating on this aswell
Dreadlocks,fp2iy69,t3_gavghb,1588262554.0,You just need to make sure you don’t crochet or retwist too often I believe. And not braid them or anything too often or tight. It’s just the tightness and pulling can cause it
Dreadlocks,fp2ixa9,t3_gavghb,1588262541.0,You just need to make sure you don’t crochet or retwist too often I believe. And not braid them or anything too often or tight. It’s just the tightness and pulling can cause it
AskScienceFiction,fp2h2vq,t1_fp2ajc9,1588261640.0,Ohh ok. Thanks
Dreadlocks,fp27fua,t1_fp26w20,1588256649.0,Mine were crocheted and I wash them weekly. My hair is like always been thick and like I couldn’t twist it up and rough it up and it would make knots easy. Like kinda wirey. Does maturing and stuff also help. I see some people with the same method and straight hair maybe straighter than mine and they’re dreads almost seem heavy and when they move their head they will “whip” back and forth and not just sort of move at the root.
Dreadlocks,fp25tz6,t1_fp247s8,1588255745.0,Yh I think I should get a silk pillowcase too
family,fp1vcvd,t1_fp1ul44,1588248854.0,Yh I get that. I can’t move out yet. That’s not normal. I’ve not got enough for that or earning enough atm
family,fp1u5xo,t1_fp1ts9h,1588247885.0,Wait I’m not actually a minor lmao. I’m just kinda stuck like I know it’s my choice. But I don’t wanna split the family or anything. We all get along. And I feel he’d be upset angry or smthn
Dreadlocks,fp1tcjf,t3_gah5p5,1588247205.0,Don’t worry about your hairline man. We notice it ourself more. Other people literally don’t look twice. I’ve seen loads of pics of people with similar hairlines. Have a look on insta if u wanna check. Should be all good.
family,fp1oo9t,t1_fp0t1iz,1588242837.0,Ohh. Idk if I could or would like a full week at my dads tho

AskScienceFiction,fp0bw2p,t1_fp05e2e,1588206295.0,Did jack only have 1 bullet for 10 years or is that line just kinda misleading and I’ve misunderstood
Taxidermy,fp0brud,t1_fp0bgj6,1588206229.0,Ok thank you how many times have u done it just out of interest? And with what animals?
Taxidermy,fp0ars2,t1_fp0a2oh,1588205685.0,Damnn man thank you. Also just wondering cus idk anything about this. How or what would I do with the body. Like we as a family have buried cats and also cremated. But like how would I go around like after she dies. (Pray it’s not for a lonngggg time yet) get her from the vets take her home cut of her paw like That’s the thing I’d feel grossed out by. It would be like my baby then I’m mutilated it. And then what just bury her I guess?
AskScienceFiction,fp09813,t1_fp083xj,1588204860.0,Ok yeah thank you. Also does jack live on that island?
Anxiety,fp08yfv,t1_foozv8u,1588204715.0,Would you have any idea what this type of anxiety is called. If it has a name. Cus I also do it with things like. I thought my hairline was receding and I have dreads and the one is thin and because the root is lose and needs tightening it feels really flimsy. And I literally keep touching it and thinking it could break and just fall off. Even tho there’s hundreds of hairs their and all my family say it’s fine I look in mirror and see it’s fine but I still keep obsessing over it

dating_advice,fp04hsz,t1_fp03sz1,1588202324.0,Lol u seem chill. I always see different responses to stuff like this. Like some say just don’t even bother. So I always ask and am always kinda confused on what’s best even tho I guess it’s a personal choice
AskScienceFiction,fp03qki,t1_fp03h70,1588201921.0,"Ohhh shit. Idk if I’m dumb for not understanding that.

Dreadlocks,foz02j7,t1_foyza70,1588182339.0,I’m using dreads Ik shampoo. Used to use dr organic. And haven’t used any other product or anything. The last wash I started using some tea tree oil and can feel in my dread it’s a little oily but it’s defo no that cus they’ve been tight like that for a while
Taxidermy,foyyt1h,t1_foyy9y2,1588181692.0,So like would I still be able to have the fur still all in contact and everything?
family,foyv7ew,t1_foyur7e,1588179780.0,My problem is idk if he would be ok. I don’t wanna upset him or anger him type thing.
dating_advice,foxx4ro,t1_foxwutv,1588159253.0,Yh that’s what I thought lmao. Good talking to u anyway
dating_advice,foxwrvr,t1_foxwmbn,1588158917.0,Noice. I was always unsure wether to tel her partner. But I thought maybe she just had a slip of judgement and messed up. Don’t wanna ruin it if they are actually happy
dating_advice,foxwerx,t1_foxw5s5,1588158575.0,Damnn :(. I kinda just feel maybe a bit sorry for her partner like I swear they we’re together. And still are so if she don’t that with me. Has she done it with others? While still being “in love” with him. Hope your doing well now anyway
dating_advice,foxvw9i,t1_foxvmbj,1588158086.0,Yhh defo. I do get what ur saying. And sort of agree more. Like they can’t all be bunched up. I do think I have trust issues aswell especially since the last girl I was talking to  went back to her ex then months later talking to me again but her partner had valentines pics on his insta from a few days before. I ended up kinda asking her and she removed me off snap. So maybe I’m just reflecting on personal experiences but overall I would be a little sus of it all
