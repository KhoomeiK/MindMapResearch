ptsd,fr0ce0y,t3_gltfer,1589790674.0,"You should practice CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy. It’ll help you to be self aware of your negative thoughts and how to change them. I think the first step would be to realize that you’re not thinking rationally. To figure out what stresses are causing your paranoia? Are they negative thoughts? Situational? Is it something in your environment that triggered you? Once you establish what’s causing it then you can work from there. From changing your thought process to something that won’t keep you in a spiral. I notice sometimes when I get paranoid it’s because I’m stressed. Or I didn’t sleep well the night before. I’ve been trying a lot of hypnosis videos that help tremendously with relaxation."

Lime zest (1 tsp), 2 tsp of fresh squeezed lime juice, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, cilantro, parsley, half of a small jalapeño pepper (throw in blender). For the shrimp put 2 tsp of extra olive oil, 1 tsp of organic chili powder, 1/8 salt in large frying pan. Mix together over medium heat and add your peeled shrimp for five minutes or until opaque. Dice up mango and avocados. Mix dressing, salad, mango, and avocado together. Put on plate and serve shrimp over top. This is so amazingly delicious and fresh!

So certain people may go to you if you’re more laid back and easy to talk to for advice. Verse being the friend who they would take to a party or something. It doesn’t necessarily mean they like that friend more. Even if it appears that way and they’re spending much more time with them. I was always second in a lot of relationships. Sometimes even third to be honest and it did not feel good at all. I was rejected a million times. Yet, I found people who put me first and who want me in their life. Verse people who don’t. I’ve come to a much more peaceful place accepting that not everyone will understand me or get me. Or love me the way I  wish they would or as I do them. Some people flat out hate me and I’ve accepted that and come to peace with it. We cannot make everyone like or even love us. I will not be everyone’s cup of tea. The best thing to do is to let all that go and accept it. Try to find the right people who appreciate you exactly as you are. We cannot change anyone accept ourselves. Don’t give up!"

Irritability on and off. Sometimes trouble concentrating. It helps a lot with agoraphobia, ocd, depression, anxiety. I take it for those reasons. PTSD is something I have but a pill won’t fix that. It’ll help but you really have to do mindfulness, CBT, DBT, or whatever therapy that helps you for it. I wish you the best of luck though and I hope you’ll find the right one to help you."

I read that it’s associated with the sleep disorder narcolepsy. When you have them your oxygen to your brain gets cut off more. Stress, jet lag, sleep deprivation and panic disorder may trigger it. My problem is when I have an episode and finally can move and get out of it. I’ll feel extremely sedated (when I did not take anything) that I cannot wake up. I’ll pass back out to have another one and then another. That’s how I know its for sure a form of narcolepsy. My other siblings suffer from this as well so I’m wondering if it’s genetic?"

Particularly at night and suicidal thoughts. Like hanging myself on my staircase as it would be a sure death since the drop is so far down. Which I know is not normal to have these types of obsessive thoughts. I also have rage and anger inside from people who have hurt me and treated me like I did not matter for many years, who I have not forgiven. A lot of my depression and suicidal thoughts comes from the hurt they caused me. I know God would want me to give it to Him. To let it go and forgive. Yet, I can’t bring myself to do so because I’m just so angry. Which, I can take it out on others at times. I carry the weight of that pain. At times I even feel hatred towards the people who hurt me and I don’t want that. It’s not the person I am at heart. I’ve prayed to God that the people who hurt me can experience the same pain they caused me. I hate that I’m like this and have these thoughts. I have no peace inside when I think of these people. I almost wish I could wipe my memory of them because it’s just too painful and they don’t know how much I loved them. They just shitted on me over and over again until I finally had enough and walked away. I wish this pain would go away. I’ve prayed for God to take it away. This is not a healthy way to live with these thoughts festering inside. Living a daily normal life on the outside but on the inside is this darkness."

Christianity,fo32gwq,t1_fo12ldt,1587479281.0,"Haha, thanks and I loved what you wrote as well. I too have a dark sense of humor. God and Jesus has a sense of humor as well. My favorite is when he appeared to his disciples as a ghost. Also, when he was on the boat with his disciples in a massive storm. They were panicking and He was asleep, haha. Then when he walked out on the water and told Peter to walk towards Him. Only to let him sink and recover him due to his lack of faith. There’s many things in the Bible that show God’s funny humor and through His son, our Lord and Savior. We also have to think that He made us in His perfect image. Even to think about the creation of life has humor to it. He made these funny looking creatures (animals) to be with Adam so he was not lonely. Then He made women out of a mans rib and named us wo-men. After Jesus resurrection. He keeps appearing with wit. 

On the roadway, Jesus approached and began walking with them, but “their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.” He said to them, “What are you debating between yourselves as you walk along?” They paused sadly. Cleopas asked “Don’t you know all the things that have occurred?” Jesus answered, “What things?” They said to him, “The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who became a prophet powerful in work and word before God and all the people; and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over to the sentence of death and crucified him. We were hoping He was the one destined to deliver Israel."" And Jesus answered them, “O how can you be so slow in heart to believe on all the things the prophets spoke! Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?” Then Jesus gave them a history lesson, starting with Moses and all the Prophets as “he interpreted to them things pertaining to Himself in all the Scriptures.” Finally they got close to the village where they were journeying, and He made as if He was journeying on farther. But they urged Him, saying, “Stay with us, because it is toward evening and the day has already passed.” And so, He went inside to stay with them. But as they sat down to eat, He took the loaf, blessed it, broke it and began to hand it to them. At that, the Bible says, “their eyes were fully opened and they recognized him.” And He disappeared. Amazed, they said to each other, “Were not our hearts burning as He was speaking to us on the road?”

Meanwhile the doors were locked since the disciples were afraid that they might be crucified next. But suddenly, Jesus stood in their midst and said, “May you have peace.” And they were terrified, thinking He was a ghost. So He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why is it that doubts come up in your hearts? See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; feel me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones just as you behold that I have.”"
Christianity,fo0c9sh,t1_fnz04ws,1587410170.0,"I agree with everything you said. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and beliefs. I became a Christian very late in life, on my own accord at the age of 30. Nobody influenced me or forced me. In fact my family did not support my decision at all at first. Especially being Jewish. My father was not too happy. Now some of my family supports it and even have gone to church a few times with me. I am no way near perfect which is an assumption people mistake about Christians. If a Christian commits a sin, people judge and say “How can you call yourself a Christian if you’re doing such and such. One person went on my Reddit account and posted how many times I cussed on here. I curse like a sailor and it’s one I’ve always struggled with. As well as anger and being humble. I try to explain to people that our sins don’t define us as Christians. We are all human and sin. It does not take away from our love with God or our walk. Whether we falter a lot along the way. I believe God is waiting for you to open that door to invite him in. A lot of people are fearful of Christians and other religions. Some people thought I joined a cult or something when I became Christian."

Perhaps having him sleep in your bed every night and hugging him. Letting him know you’re here and not going anywhere. Can you try music therapy at night? I downloaded this free app in the app store on my phone called Relax Sound (blue background with palm trees “logo”). It has a bunch of free nature sounds that have helped me to at least relax. Youtube has free videos as well. Just type in bedtime music and you’ll find deep sleep music. Some will play for eight hours long. I plug in my phone and flip it down so I don’t see any light and just play it all night. I’ve read that by exposing the brain to beats that create low-frequency tones in the brain. The sound waves create shifts in brainwaves themselves, generating slower frequency brainwaves that promote deeper states of relaxation. Perhaps trying it for two weeks to see if it helps him at all. You can also buy a Himalayan salt lamp and keep it by you alls bed for relaxing. 

Grief is the worst pain anyone can go through. When I lost my aunt who was like my mother who I lived with. Nothing could possibly prepare me for that day. I felt her go and nothing will ever explain that feeling and shock. I cried every night to sleep for an entire year. Even after that year it was extremely painful. I used to dream I was chasing her and trying to find her. For years I’d see her car on the road and I’d speed up to see if she was in it. Knowing she was gone. It’s like I couldn’t accept it. The weirdest thing is I would smell her from time to time. I think that was her saying hi. It’s been thirteen years and I still cry from time to time but it’s gotten easier. They live on inside us and we carry their memories on. The love you have for them is just as deep as if they were here yesterday. I will be praying for you all tonight that things will get easier with time. That you two will be even more bonded and closer then ever before. That light will enter through all this darkness."

I’ve been in the grieving process for more then a year now. It’s shitty... I’ll be talking to a therapist over the phone since I cannot go in person now. I’d suggest finding one if you can afford it or have health insurance. Perhaps even buying a cognitive behavioral therapy book that has great reviews. Looking up positive YouTube videos on how to get over anger. Or how to forgive. Even finding some spiritual or religious outlook can help. I wish you luck as I struggle with the same thing."

It’s a safe place where you can unwind or have all the imagination in the world. Anyways, you should rest and drink tons of water. Thank you for replying back and I’m glad it’s negative!"

The morning after I killed myself, I woke up. I made myself breakfast in bed. I added salt and pepper to my eggs and used my toast for a cheese and bacon sandwich. I squeezed a grapefruit into a juice glass. I scraped the ashes from the frying pan and rinsed the butter off the counter. I washed the dishes and folded the towels. The morning after I killed myself, I fell in love. Not with the boy down the street or the middle school principal. Not with the everyday jogger or the grocer who always left the avocados out of the bag. I fell in love with my mother and the way she sat on the floor of my room holding each rock from my collection in her palms until they grew dark with sweat. I fell in love with my father down at the river as he placed my note into a bottle and sent it into the current. With my brother who once believed in unicorns but who now sat in his desk at school trying desperately to believe I still existed. The morning after I killed myself, I walked the dog. I watched the way her tail twitched when a bird flew by or how her pace quickened at the sight of a cat. I saw the empty space in her eyes when she reached a stick and turned around to greet me so we could play catch but saw nothing but sky in my place. I stood by as strangers stroked her muzzle and she wilted beneath their touch like she did once for mine. The morning after I killed myself, I went back to the neighbors’ yard where I left my footprints in concrete as a two year old and examined how they were already fading. I picked a few daylilies and pulled a few weeds and watched the elderly woman through her window as she read the paper with the news of my death. I saw her husband spit tobacco into the kitchen sink and bring her her daily medication. The morning after I killed myself, I watched the sun come up. Each orange tree opened like a hand and the kid down the street pointed out a single red cloud to his mother. The morning after I killed myself, I went back to that body in the morgue and tried to talk some sense into her. I told her about the avocados and the stepping stones, the river and her parents. I told her about the sunsets and the dog and the beach. The morning after I killed myself, I tried to unkill myself, but couldn’t finish what I started.

Today it’s been killing me from the time I woke up to now. It feels tight and like someone punched me hard in it. Not sure if it’s indigestion. Let me know what your results are when it comes back.

I’ve been playing a lot of Destiny 2 on my PS4. I bought the newest season. Played for four hours yesterday so my head was spinning by the time I turned it off. Today I’ll play some more and then I have to clean my place again. Been trying to mop and vacuum every three days. My kids also have so much homework. I’m actually enjoying it more then being so overwhelmed by  all of it in the beginning. I’m literally now a teacher in every subject. Luckily art is on my side, since I’m an artist. Anyways, what games do you play on the switch. I played Animal Crossing with my sister online. She plays that game for five hours everyday with her boyfriend. Her museum was super cool if you’ve played that game? I love how it teaches you about all the artifacts and stuff. So you’re actually learning as you’re playing."

ptsd,fm8qr5a,t1_fm8gww4,1585854270.0,"Thank you, I’m happy you are very self aware and that you don’t do any of that stuff I explained. I hope you didn’t think I was saying you were emotionally abusing her. I was saying it’s only emotional abuse if you put it into action which didn’t seem to be the case from your post. You sound like a great partner and care very much about her happiness. I can tell you love her a lot. I’m sorry you have those thoughts that come up from time to time. I myself get triggered here and there but like you I know the reason why. Plus, it’s all a work in progress. I’m seeing a couples counselor. Also, a counselor for myself but since this virus hit it kind of has messed everything up."
ptsd,fm782ac,t1_fm6zglm,1585816675.0,"I agree with what this person said. Even if she distances herself from everyone to make you happy. It’ll make her unhappy inside that you do not trust her and that she cannot even have friends. This is emotional abuse. Even if she did distance herself off. You still probably will never trust her. Which has to maybe do with your self esteem or perhaps something horrible you experienced with another female from the past. If that’s the case then you never got over that ex and are carrying your baggage into your relationship. Which will only make your girlfriend suffer. One of my friends is my ex. We’ve been friends for seventeen years. Some people make better friends then lovers. I don’t ever see him but text him here and there. My boyfriend that I’m with now has no problem at all with it because he trusts me. However, my previous ex was not okay with me talking to any guys or going to certain places. He threatened to leave me if I did so I never did to keep him around. He never ever trusted me and I tried to do everything to please him. Even when I tried to do everything to show him I love him and put him first. It got me completely alone in the end. It even makes me feel pathetic writing this. I stopped talking to a lot of people and isolated myself. Still it was never was enough. Don’t do the same thing and push a good girl away unless you have proof. I’m also not saying your emotionally abusing her because it sounds like you’re keeping this stuff inside which isn’t good either. It becomes emotional abuse if you start to control her. It sucks because it’s a double edge sword. If you tell her you don’t want her being friends with guys. She will no you do not trust her and chances are it’ll make her uncomfortable inside and it’ll always be in the back of her mind whenever she does talk to her friends or ex. Unless she gives you a reason to not trust her then I’d trust that she is being genuine. Even though I know this is hard to do."
