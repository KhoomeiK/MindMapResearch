depression,fhwsee2,t3_f51oky,1581927928.0,"In my experience my depression would come and go. When it hits it's pretty bad but I talked to my therapist and I told her that i don't want to live knowing it'll be back and she told me that if I know it'll be back then I know it'll pass. And since then it has not come back. It makes me sad to se all these people saying they will end it all once they lose that person that they love. PLEASE love yourself, do what YOU love without guilt. You should want to live for yourselves because each and every one of you make the world more unique. Please people if I can see that all of you are special and that the world would be worse off without you, surely you can see it too."
