nfl,fqsqe34,t3_gkqnv9,1589615195.0," ""If a team hires a minority head coach, that team, in the draft preceding the coach's second season, would move up six spots from where it is slotted to pick in the third round. A team would jump 10 spots under the same scenario for hiring a person of color as its primary football executive, a position more commonly known as general manager.

* If a team were to fill both positions with diverse candidates in the same year, that club could jump 16 spots -- six for the coach, 10 for the GM -- and potentially move from the top of the third round to the middle of the second round. Another incentive: a team's fourth-round pick would climb five spots in the draft preceding the coach's or GM's third year if he is still with the team. That is considered significant because Steve Wilks and Vance Joseph, two of the four African-American head coaches hired since 2017, were fired after one and two seasons, respectively."""
nfl,fqspza3,t3_gkk8jg,1589614798.0,"Born and raised in Tampa.

NFL - Jacksonville Jaguars - I was taught to hate the Glazers. They were seen as cheap owners who were essentially stealing tax dollars from fans.  My dad was a Phins fan but I wanted to do my own thing. Heard about a new team called the Jacksonville Jaguars and found out they played close to the Gators.  Liked their uniforms and that was all I needed at 5 years old.  

College - Wisconsin Badgers - I grew up a Florida Gator fan for the longest time.  As I got closer to college age I started interacting with people who either went there or were going to go there.  They're all a bunch of pretentious fucks who know nothing about football.  Abandoned them and went with the Badgers who had always been my 2nd team because my family is from Wisco.  

MLB - Toronto Blue Jays - Started getting into baseball before the Rays existed.  Blue Jays were one of my favorite birds and I loved the logo when I saw it.

NHL - Tampa Bay Lightning - The only local team I support.  I didn't care about hockey much but I used to work in radio.  Ended up producing their radio broadcasts for three seasons and got to learn a lot from the play by play guys."
