BipolarReddit,ffmep0t,t3_eu62o5,1580053486.0,"I was first diagnosed with ADHD at 7. Anxiety and depression at 12. 

Continue to be treated for those issues throughout my teens and into my 20‚Äôs.

Got a degree in psychology. And then another in clinical social work. (In order to achieve this, I had to pass a graduate-level class on how to diagnose properly using the DSM 5). 

Despite years of treatment, something never felt quite right. I was impulsive. Couldn‚Äôt handle money. I‚Äôd have periods of functioning very well on little sleep. Bursts of creative energy. My therapist suggested BPD, but I couldn‚Äôt agree with her. I never had the ‚Äúdysfunction in relationships‚Äù that is hallmark of BPD. I wondered if I was somewhere on the bipolar spectrum.

At 27, I was going through a rough time at work. Went to a new psych doc. Got prescribed lexapro. Went straight into a severe mania/mixed episode. Tried to kill myself 3 times in 6 weeks. During that time, I tried to convince my new doc to give me a mood stabilizer, as I felt I was bipolar. (And I have the education and license to diagnose this in others). She just thought I was another crazy young mental health professional and just kept switching my antidepressant, instead of letting me try a mood stabilizer. 

Thankfully, that doc quit the practice 6 weeks into my mixed suicidal mania. The practitioner who took over for her actually agreed with me. After several trials of different meds, he put me on lithium and it‚Äôs been amazing. I‚Äôve been stable for years now.

I cannot properly convey the relief it felt to have a doctor listen to me!"

High achiever - perfect grad school GPA, dream job out of school. Then almost the exact same symptoms - suddenly wanting to kill myself and then I got manic. I was diagnosed with BP1 at age 27. 

As far as the lamictal goes, I was on it for over a year and felt it only sort of kind of worked. I felt very depressed and not much else. Eventually my pdoc discovered there is a drug interaction between lamictal and my birth control (nexplanon), making the lamictal less effective. He swapped me to lithium and it was been absolutely life changing. 

I‚Äôd say just give it some more time (maybe like 2 weeks to a month), then let your doc know it‚Äôs not working for you. There are lots of mood stabilizers out there.

From another perspective, to answer your last question, I also work in the mental health field. Most people that I‚Äôve seen over the last 5 years with a bipolar diagnosis DO have to stay on some sort of maintenance medication dose. There are of course exceptions, but most people stay on medication long term. This is also true for many people with depression and anxiety. 

It may seem like a big deal at first, but it really isn‚Äôt. Working in healthcare in general, I‚Äôd say the vast majority of adults (in US) are on some sort of daily medication. You will adjust to the diagnosis and find a regimen that works and life will be so much better!"

I work as a licensed therapist on a psychiatric unit for adults at a hospital. In my part of the country, counselors (LPCs, can be MA or MEd) and masters level social workers essentially do the same thing when it comes to mental health/therapy. The main difference is the schooling/licensure. Most counseling programs are 3 years and my social work programs are about 2. Also the licensure process is more complicated for counselors rather than social workers. But I have friends who are school ‚Äúcounselors‚Äù and some are LPCs and some are LMSWs!
