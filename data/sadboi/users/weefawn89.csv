I'm simplifying but I hope you get the picture. For some reason one of our most prestigious colleges in the country (Trinity) had a jam making course with exceptionally low points needed to get in.

dogs,fqjwik7,t3_gj6rwc,1589416218.0,"It's a difficult one for me because my country is the puppy mill CAPITAL of Europe. Enormous amounts of puppies are churned out day in, day out in some of the most appalling, unspeakable conditions. The government does fuck all to prevent it. There has in response been a huge number of small rescues, home based rescues, dogs shelters run through donations. Those rescues are struggling. They are inundated day in, day out, year in, year out, by hundreds and hundreds of dogs. We also still have a poor culture of responsibility for our dogs. Irresponsible breeding is a HUGE thing. Free roaming dogs are STILL a thing. The situation is completely dire in my country. It is GRIM. And then there is our greyhound racing industry which is FUNDED by our government. Unspeakable evils are committed to racers day in, day out, year in, year out and the perpetrators continue to get off scot-free. Ex racing dogs are euthanized or sold to dog meat markets abroad, often those dogs are only 1 or 2 years old. 


So I understand and respect that reputable breeders are a thing in the world. There are even some in Ireland.


But I also fully sympathise with those in my country who are fully anti-breeders. Because I understand where they are coming from. Because the situation is dire and the rescues in this country are floundering.

Edit: for clarification I don't agree with those in my country who are antibreeder I just understand their hurt and frustration and exhaustion. A lot of change needs to happen for dog welfare here and things are going to continue being very divisive here for a long time"
