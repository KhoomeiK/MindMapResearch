BPD,fiyj89v,t3_faibwv,1582840459.0,"I'm recommending weed over Bezos.
I'm recommending good porn and a good vibrator. 
Orgasms feel good without a doubt, but casual sex usually isnt as fulfilling and leaves room for emotional consequences. Chin up and have a good wank x"

BPD,fdrvn4y,t1_fdrq6dq,1578690383.0,Hey that's what this sub is all about hope you feel support from us fellow BPDers at least :)
BPD,fdrc307,t1_fdra5qq,1578682395.0,"I understand, sorry if it came across like I was trying to deny your very real response to it. I was trying to say that I went through what you're going through for a long time and a lot of pent up anger, frustration, shame, resentment, self loathing and intense lonliness alongside it. There is a light at the end of the tunnel though. If you work on yourself I promise that feeling for acceptance from others can dwindle! Honestly ((hugs))"
BPD,fdr506a,t3_emtpd9,1578679625.0,"I can't relate to being a Male with a  BPD diagnosis but have experienced the ""haha no"" response enough times to not bother to tell people anymore unless mental health comes up naturally in conversations. After getting my diagnosis I felt like I was reading a detailed list of my experiences and feelings so to have others read it themselves and deny it to have relevance to their experience of me was very unvaildating for a long while. It wasn't until I realised that it didn't really matter what other people thought and that maybe I would prefer them to have that view rather than a very negative stigmatised view where they just stop any and all contact based on a diagnosis after years of friendship. Try and see it as ignorance and live in hope things will change and better in the future & continue on your path to your own healing :)"
BPD,f7ku9mt,t3_dwox4x,1573826049.0,I love this. So affirming.
BPD,f4oagh5,t3_dl682b,1571698587.0,"I completely relate. Part of myself says ""I don't want to be people pleaser"" and the other part of me says ""I want every person to like me"" it's an insane tread of a tight rope that I just can't seem to handle."
BPD,f4b7ax0,t1_f4b70zi,1571507919.0,Same to you hope you have a nice weekend.
BPD,f4b57zl,t1_f4b1365,1571506989.0,"Wow we have quite a bit in common here I could have written that myself. It's comforting actually, makes me feel not so alone in it all so glad I found this group. I bought the dialectical behaviour therapy workbook by Matthew Mckay from Amazon, it's good because you can write in it and it works through it all with you. I also got a book called The Disbelief Habit: How to Use Doubt to Make Peace with Your Inner Critic Yong Kang Chan very good read. There's a lot of books on mindfulness but it's covered in DBT too!"
BPD,f4avaen,t1_f4att9l,1571502119.0,"Oh I have patterns of dark periods. It's almost yearly really, I'll slip into some sort of depression and have suicidal ideation but it's usually triggered by something not spontaneous but I'm always in denial about feeling down until I realise it's too late and then I have to start the slow crawl out of the hole again. 
I haven't been on antidepressants for over 5 years but i did some self medicating with weed, I thought it was my cure to be honest but in the end I realised I needed to really deal with my issues and feelings rather than numbing them out. It's my mood swings that I find the hardest to deal with, how I can feel hopeful and positive, fun and carefree one day and then anxious, neurotic, rigid and aggressive the next.  I'm getting a lot better at handling my feelings but I know I can't get better just willing it away. My childhood still effects me a lot and it's the one thing I want to get over and put to bed. I'm going to try private too, I just can't wait for referral times anymore. I've tried CBT twice and it didn't suit me at all. DBT is the only thing that seems to resonate with me but that's because it was specifically designed for BPD. You should look into it. I've bought books to work on myself while I find a therapist I trust/have a rapport with."
BPD,f4am45d,t1_f4alaa7,1571497398.0,"Yes definitely. Have you heard of maladaptive day dreaming? I only heard that term on a thread in here recently but I never knew it was a thing. I can get lost in imagining different realities I could be living or fantasing what if's. I've always been a day dreamer and always had a vivid imagination since I was little and it's still there but I'm trying to not do it because as much as I can enjoy indulging those ideas it also makes me feel sad when i realise that it's not actually feasible. I'm just coming out of a really dark patch where I felt like if given up, everything seemed so hopeless, life seemed to just be so full of suffering. Now I'm forcing myself to live in the present and practicing mindfulness. It's really helping! Have you tried any DBT?"
BPD,f4aj10w,t1_f4afzg9,1571495990.0,"Yes I really relate to being outside. I feel most at peace in nature, I go for walks every day, more so when I'm stressed out. Loving your job is a brilliant thing! I understand what you mean about residual regrets. I'm trying to hard to live by the notion of ""every choice I have made in the past was made because at that time it was the decision I thought was right"" and just trusting in my present self to make the right choices and not dwell in the past, it's impossible to time travel and do it all over. Now when I get those feelings of regret or shame I repeat that to myself, it's helping but I know it will take time."
BPD,f49vnof,t1_f49ui3u,1571484780.0,"Just to mention i am very lucky, the people around me accept me for my different facets same as you, I think it's more an internal guilt thinking I'm bothering people/annoying them.
It comes and goes. I did finish my degree, I was on antidepressants they never helped much but that was it but I was treating the wrong illness.
I finished with a 2:1 with honours, I'm still proud of myself for everything I achieved during that degree I guess I just have residual frustration at myself for not learning to love and accept myself sooner and going for it! I'm getting a lot better now that I'm working DBT and accepting who i am and not letting the BPD define me. 
Chemistry is a much heftier degree and work load I can imagine the pressure would be high in sciences. My brother did biochemistry and ended up having to switch over to human biology after the first year as it was sending him over the edge. My dad's a carpenter, it's a creative job, something you can immerse yourself in too. Are you enjoying it?"
BPD,f49s3in,t1_f49qjfw,1571482047.0,"Yes I know what you mean some characteristics I have are very contradictory which is confusing for me but it must be hell for people around me sometimes. 
As long as I can remember I've always wanted to be a actress and a performer (makes sense doesn't it?) I pursued acting through education, even did my degree in Theatre, it was my happiest time. But during university I started getting ill and got my first diagnosis of major depression and anxiety. It took ten years of trying to battle the depression and just working in restaurants and hotels before I got my BPD diagnosis which finally made sense. I guess my fragile self esteem just got the better of me when it came to actually putting myself out there properly. Now i just enjoy writing mostly for my creative fix. What about you?"
BPD,f49qc6h,t1_f49q3zc,1571479909.0,"Yes! Its so frustrating aswell because I desperately want to find who I am or carve a defined path but it just doesn't seem to happen, I'd love to just be able to say ""I'm a (nurse/lawyer/teacher)"" just something that grounds me."
BPD,f49p7lm,t1_f3vfnck,1571478161.0,"Yes this. Also applies to careers, like I almost think of them as roles or characters rather than actual jobs. I'll go through phases of wanting to pursue different avenues, waste loads of time on them learning everything I can then I get bored or scared and don't fully commit. Just feel like I don't even know who I am most of the time. It's crippling especially when everyone else seems so normal and adjusted."
leaves,f49p57l,t3_djz2z9,1571478060.0,"Well done! I'm on day 6 now. I smoked just like you and same reasons for anxiety too but realised I couldn't even leave the house without having a smoke, it was just holding me back and once I realised that, I just deleted all my numbers and contacts and threw out my shit. Haven't wanted a smoke since, I actually feel free like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. And I can feel my emotions again. I've laughed, cried, it's been amazing to not be numb. I've done  periods of sobriety from weed on and off since I started at 18 but at 31 now I know it just needs to be over. I would love to be one of those people that can just have a few tokes every blue moon but I just can't. I'm way to greedy with it! Keep going you can do it!"
BPD,f3xuvw4,t3_diek67,1571244212.0,"So much yes. I repeat songs over and over again I have a passion for learning lyrics especially rap music and get so involved in it I almost can lose myself in it. Same with shows I watched friends religiously when it came on Netflix and I was in a depressed patch but Gilmore girls was another one. Nostalgic things make me feel safe and comforted too, old films and shows that take you away from how your feeling. Never knew it was a BPD thing."
BPD,f15e9bu,t3_d7uevm,1569188819.0,"I don't have any advice specifically but I can empathise with the feelings completely. I feel really uncomfortable when I know people don't like me or aren't accepting me, even more so if it's been confirmed by a mutual person which it sounds like yours has by your bf. To me it sounds like you've tried above and beyond to prove yourself to your bfs friends. Not to be judgemental but it sounds like they have a superficial friendship group to feel so threatened by someone having an anxiety attack during a gathering. People have issues, everyone does, friendships should prove a safe space where you can openly discuss your life without being judged. 
Personally at this point I would expect my bf to have stepped up and vouched for me, explained that he loved me and my good qualities with examples of times I've tired to be a good friend/host etc. Of course you can't make people like you and sometimes we can just not click with people. But at least he would be setting a boundary that it wasn't okay for them to be disrespectful about you or towards you.
I don't advise you giving your bf an ultimatum regarding his friendship group (them or me type deal) it'll only worsen tension and make you seem like the unreasonable party. Give him space with his friends, explain you feel hurt by the rejection and it's part of the BPD. Be kind to yourself."
BPD,f00rtbn,t1_f00cijg,1568305627.0,Thank you for this. I'm going through a shame spiral at the moment and even though I know beating myself up about all the bad things I've done doesn't make me any better I also feel like o don't even deserve to be happy right now. It's a terrible cycle to get into.
AskReddit,ezz5vnf,t3_d32f12,1568281139.0,"When I'm struggling it's my perception of what people's expectations are of me that make me withdraw socially. 
So i think it helps to give the option of company & conversation to someone rather than it be forced or peppered with guilt if they decline.

It's just about showing understanding, compassion and patience to someone who can't provide that to themselves at that time."
raisedbynarcissists,eybsmxi,t3_cwdb8o,1566991073.0,"I completely relate, when I've been put down, ridiculed or minimised by older male figures at work or at events, I feel automatically defensive as if transported back to all the times my Ndad made or makes me feel that way. With women I have always gravitated towards loving and  empowered female figures because my mum was so distant and emotionally unstable when I was growing up and still is now. I still find it difficult to talk about anything of importance with people like my dreams and goals because if I get a dismissive response it just stamps on my confidence to pursue anything so I keep things close to my chest and only talk about the things that matter to me to people that love me and respect me."
