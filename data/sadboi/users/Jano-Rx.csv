facepalm,fbjj754,t1_fbitfon,1576934554.0,"Your points are valid and I agree with you on needing better ways to ID those who really need these medications. 

I have heard the water and peroxide being compared to meth and Adderall, I agree that the meth to Adderall comparison does place an unfair stigma in the eyes of some. I do not agree with the stigma but I also do not like the comparison saying H2O is to H2O2 what meth is to Adderall. There is a huge difference between, an O-O bond in peroxide which can cause it to form free radicals and, water's stable chemical structure. The radical formation is why we use it for wound cleaning and to prevent infections, but it is also why it is toxic when ingested. This makes changing one thing (completely different functional group) in the structure of water completely different from going, from a secondary amine to a primary amine (similar functional groups), which is the case in the  methamphetamine to Adderall comparison. Meth and Adderall cause an increase in dopamine release through the same receptors, the only difference is that Adderall is less lipophilic and does not cross the blood brain barrier as easily as meth does. This difference is the reason Adderall has a higher benefit to risk ratio and less risk of addiction than meth does even though they act on the same receptors. This is the reason that one has a medical purpose and the other is a DEA schedule 1 drug (like cocaine and heroin).

So in short meth and Adderall are much more alike than water and hydrogen peroxide but Adderall has a medical purpose. I know that this may make it seem like I am saying meth and Adderall are the same but that is not my point, and I believe I have pointed out the major difference in this comment. I do disagree with people who try to use this comparison to place a stigma on Adderall because it does have a huge benefit when taken by someone who needs it. 

If there is a comparison to be made its that heroin is to morphine what meth is to Adderall. So again, I agree with what you are saying and we are both on the right side of this. 

You are correct in that I needed to be corrected because I did not explain myself very well (or at all really) when I compared meth and Adderall in my previous comment. I sometimes say things that make more sense in my head without regard to the difference of interpretation that exists when others with different frames of reference read or hear my words. (My frame of reference is a chemistry and pharmacy background if it isn't clear from above lol)"
facepalm,fbiqfzf,t1_fbhzo9y,1576909813.0,"Agreed. That's actually the point I am making, people who need them should take them, but many who do, especially little kids, don't really need them. They are just on them because Karens want drugs that will make their children more docile. These drugs are essentially methamphetamine and they do have long term permanent cardiovascular risks. 

The blood thinner analogy holds water but is not completely applicable because most people will not ask to be put on a blood thinner, like they will ask to be prescribed Vyvanse or Adderall. There is plenty of objective evidence based guidelines for when to put someone on a blood thinner, and I have never heard of a healthy person wanting to take Xarelto for no reason. ADHD is a clinical diagnosis and the criteria is rather subjective and changes from provider to provider, and all you have to say is ""I am having trouble focusing/paying attention"" to get diagnosed by many. I would make an argument for restricting prescribing authority to specialists because too many ADHD med prescriptions are written to appease parents who are trying to medicate their children to change their behavior."
