confessions,fdc375i,t3_ekjwke,1578266189.0,"Psh I get it. But my normal excuse is that I’m sleeping (have a bad sleep schedule and everyone knows I like to sleep when I can) and I’ve been doing it for years with A LOT of people so it works in my favor. Sometimes I wanna be by myself just relaxing and getting my mind off of life, doing things I wanna do by myself just to distract myself from everything & basically have “me” time. Sucks lying, but if it’s for your best interest and peace of mind I sorta don’t see anything wrong with it so it’s completely understandable."
CPTSD,f5e851u,t3_dnowcl,1572166417.0,"I’ve never seen anything that truly represents or relates to how I was as a kid.
I was constantly sick or “sick”. I always had a stomachache but never knew why & it also happened a lot before school. I was constantly physically drained almost everyday. Didn’t want to participate in school, school activities or any activities actually. I was separated from friends and family. 
I was diagnosed with depression around the age of 8 because of a traumatic experience I had with the way my grandmother died, and that was also around the same time my mother became a alcoholic. I was never fully diagnosed with anxiety til around 15-16. I always wondered why. Why I was different, why I was always sick or in pain, why I was always scared, why it would  always come out of nowhere during certain times.
Not until my adult years did I actually realize that it also had something to do with anxiety. It was just my body’s way of expressing it and I never knew how to communicate it because I didn’t even know what it was at that time.
I thank you for posting this article, it truly speaks wonders and puts things into a new perspective for those who always wondered “why” and for parents to think outside the box at times when their child says “I have a stomachache” for the last couple weeks even after going to the doctors."

I feel like nothing is my home even when I’m home. I moved to Florida after being in jersey my whole life & that’s what I thought I meant. But even when I’m in jersey I feel the same exact way. I thought it meant being with my grandmother who passed but it still didn’t make sense. You saying mentally homeless makes perfect sense & hits close to home. Thank you for saying those words, just know your not alone and make complete sense."

Anxiety,ewashur,t3_cn74pu,1565250830.0,"Trust me I completely understand. Me being 25 I thought my life would be completely different from what it is now. The way society is, they make you think you should have things put together by a certain time or age. I think it puts more pressure on us to try to exceed those expectations but in reality sometimes it isn’t even possible. I completely understand and feel the exact same way as you do. Know your not alone. Everything will fall into place eventually..at least that’s what I keep telling myself. And I hope for it to be true."

But if you want this to stop I highly suggest you do something about it. Long story short maybe google a couple of things to help the situation. But by what you’ve said this is a very very serious situation. Especially the bruises. You have something attached to you & it may very well be attached to you for A WHILE and won’t leave you alone until it hurts you or gets what it wants or more. Seek help, I sincerely hope everything turns out well. Good luck."
