Thanks for commenting, by the way."
depression,fcu2kip,t3_eit53m,1577970549.0,"I kind of agree. I, differing from you, don't want to die. I want to keep living. But, thoughta that could be considered suicidal come to my mind at the times. I want to live, but not like this. A new game, or reset button would be quite helpful for most of us... Still, I'm afraid that if I don't appreciate what I have, things may get worse."

We watch the series because it matters to us, we also want to learn the details about the characters because they matter to us. Gender is a part of a character, and the characters are a huge part of the series, like it or not. If you don't care, you don't need to read the comments nor join the discussion about it. You are, in my opinion, unnecessarily rude. There are many shows with no ambiguous characters, and fanbases with very little to no discussion of gender. If you are so bothered by it, you can always spend more time on those that makes you feel more comfortable.
There are some people who insist on their opinnion regardless of there is something to prove it correct or not, and there are others to correct who they believe is mistaken. And, there is nothing wrong with that. That's what a discussion is, it's a harmless way of communication, until one or more parties start responding aggressively. Having some about gender shouldn't, if you ask me, be an issue.


I'm sorry. This is kind of messy, and maybe unnecessary. I feel like I should defend what I agree with when there is someone to be rude against those with the same thoughts."
depression,fbgf7ei,t3_eczhm3,1576847553.0,"I don't want to tell a stranger to choose their friend over family, but I think you should. You probably have spent many Christmases with your family, and are likely to have some, if not many, opportunities to do so in the future. However, your friend sounds to be in a very sensitive and critical state, obviously, and I think your support could really help her. More than helping, she probably needs you, and her other loved ones to be with her. Your parents don't seem to be the most understanding people, if I am to judge. Of course, family cannot be replaced, but this one day would, I believe, be a lot more important to your friend, than it would be to tour family.


I don't know any of you, so I cannot say something certain, but in my opinnion, you should most definitely be with your friend."
