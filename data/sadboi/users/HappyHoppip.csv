BPD,fdasmzu,t3_ekasdi,1578249584.0,I feel this so hard :/
BPD,fd4y9ev,t1_fd3q6zt,1578172316.0,"yeah my bad, I don't think I worded what I meant very clearly. A lot of the times when I'm feeling down I don't really express it in any way (especially to the people who I don't want the attention from) because it usually isn't impossible to hide it for the most part (hit them with that ""yeah I'm okay I'm just feeling tired"" lmao).

when I'm around my FPs though, I will deliberately not try as hard to hide my feelings whenever I'm down, and instead give subtle hints that there's something wrong (like not eating, not sleeping, sounding lethargic, etc). It's honestly really stupid because I still tell them that I'm fine if they ask, so unless they can read my mind it's not even actually guaranteeing anything.

but I guess in a way it is still manipulative though, because I'm doing this knowing that there's a chance it'll make them worry about me. I do feel pretty pathetic whenever this happens and I wish I would stop because it ends up spiraling me into a hole of shame and deprication :/ but it's definitely a work in progress."

BPD,fd0vmzt,t1_fd0tdfj,1578124370.0,"wow that analogy makes way more sense than I wish it did.

also I relate to you regarding your FPs, it's almost as if I have a FFP lmao. I don't even text either of my two current FPs, they're just people I meet a couple times a week. So I just end having to replay our past interactions of them comforting me over and over again, and I feel like an obsessive creep but it's the only way I can cope when I'm upset :("
BPD,fd0u4hb,t1_fd0rfga,1578123786.0,"I actually just realized that the ""certain people"" I mentioned in the post were probably just all of the FPs I've had in my life (I just recently got diagnosed with BPD so I've been making all of these connections and it's all making sense now 😅)

thank you for your input though, it was helpful :) I should keep a list I can look back on with a bunch of activities to distract myself from my wallowing lmao"

SuicideWatch,f35wx6i,t3_dfrbbo,1570695203.0,"The idea in Christianity is we were all created under the image of God. So it's the murder of a creation under God's image. Many people actually have different opinions about whether someone actually goes to Hell if they choose suicide. 

Some believe that because God is a loving God, He takes mental illness into consideration and sees your heart instead of your actions. Others are more strict on what the bible says, and believe that because God is a fair and just God, He still judges based on what we do with our free will in the end.

I can't tell you which is correct. I do believe in God even though I've been slowly slipping away. It's honestly one of the few reasons why I'm still hanging on. We weren't created to be depressed, this is an illness like any other. The bible says we will face a whole bunch of trials and tribulations but that we're supposed to overcome it through God.

I'm not trying to convert you or deem this the absolute truth or whatever btw lmao. Just giving insight on what I was taught to further help you understand what you wanted to know.

Honestly, my plan for a really long time was to try and kill myself with a really slow method (overdosing, slitting wrists, etc) and then start repenting like crazy with the time I had left. Lmao it's fucking ridiculous, I know. Not only would the ""repentance"" be disingenuous, but with all the time I had left I'd probably start wanting to live again and get help as my survical instincts kick in. 

Anyways, hope that gave you whatever answers you wanted. Peace to you sister/brother"
Christianity,f2zh8ip,t3_dew3od,1570521667.0,"Hey! Firstly, do you go to church? If not, I would say that's a great way to start. Maybe you can go with your mom if she goes to one, or you can just find a local one with people around your age. Or you can even join a Christian club at your school if there are any, which can then lead to you finding a good chrch. That's how I started. Haven't looked back since.

Having other people around you to look towards when you can't see God really helps in bringing you back if you ever do stray. There were many times I wanted to run from God, but the amazing friends (and especially my Pastor) that I met there were great help in finding my faith and passion again.

If you do go about wanting to join a church, I would also suggest attending a more smaller church than a mega church. This is purely anecdotal, but I found that I had a much stronger connection to those I met in smaller churches, and in turn had a stronger connection to God. We really felt like brothers and sisters, all in a house under our Father in heaven.

Good luck to you! I'm 19 right now, but I started my spiritual journey when I was 15. Don't worry about your age :)"
