Looking at a few items from different categories, nothing is sticking out as higher mark up.. they all come out to around 14-16%."

Also, yes it does show the shopper's picture and name when it asks me to rate them. I'm guessing that helps to humanize the shopper so maybe people are less likely to leave a bad review/tip for no reason."
