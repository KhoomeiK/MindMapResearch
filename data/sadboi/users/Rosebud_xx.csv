AskReddit,fpwqczt,t3_gg081m,1588968042.0,"I am a CNA. I covered an overnight shift,so i did not have this man as a regular client. i arrive, and his son that lives with him tells me he is dying tonight (he’d been on hospice for a long time) so they basically just want me to stay in the room with him and then text the family (who will all be upstairs....) when he dies so they can come down. When i get to his room the tv is playing a movie but i am not watching it as i was reading a book and holding his hand. He ends up passing around 1 am so i text his family. they all come down and are in the room praying and crying and it was upsetting. one daughter is on my shoulder just sobbing and holding onto me. the movie is still playing and the credits start rolling.... and you know what song is in the credits. Pony by genuwine. i couldn’t like rush out of this woman’s grasp to get the remote to turn it off, just tried to ignore it. after a minute of hearing this while the family is just sobbing around their dead dad, i had to reach for the remote and mute it. i get chills basically thinking about how uncomfortable it was. i am released early from the shift but stay as long as they wanted to help clean up and talk. when i leave eventually i just cry/laugh the whole way home."

rapecounseling,fl0x01e,t3_flwaxp,1584717538.0,"i understand your rape damaging your self worth, it isn’t for forever though. you are worthy and beautiful and capable. The power it currently seems to have over you is not forever and i promise that. 

I did tell my partners i was in a serious relationship with. Which was 2. and they were really good about it. A few times here and there i would have flashbacks in the middle of sex and it felt embarrassing but they were so caring they made me feel so much better and safer, rather than more vulnerable. i felt exposed but they both immediately made me feel safe and loved in that vulnerable moment. so if your guy is anywhere near decent he will do the same for you, as you deserve. 

maybe just let him know you have something important to talk to him about. take some deep breaths. maybe even write down some points to reference to , to make it easier. Something to read off of. Sounds cheesy but might help.Tell him as little or as much as you like. I know it’s scary to feel vulnerable after such trauma, because you were vulnerable around a very bad person and they took advantage of that. but being vulnerable around the right person who cares about you, should make you feel safe and reassure you. 

If there is any particular way your rapist touched you, maybe let him know about that too so he can avoid it. I have done this with partners. establish a safe word maybe?

I am so sorry this happened to you. you are so deserving of the very very best. This is what you deserved all along, nothing less. nothing what you were given. It’s not your fault. You are so beautiful and strong and deserving of the very best. lots of love and healing energy your way, take care."

It’ll likely change over time and constantly be growing as he grows, what he needs etc. I’m not saying it doesn’t suck for you or effect you but frankly it doesn’t matter. My ex went to meetings and was all about it and i just chose to participate and was down for whatever was included to keep him on track. I enjoyed going to the meetings with him and all. Throughout my ex’s struggles i had to realize it’s not about me and never was. We broke up for other reasons though. I would say voice your feelings but he has to put himself first before a relationship. He can’t compromise on what he needs to stay sober. It’s up to you what you’re willing to put up with or if you can’t compromise and deal with this. I am not at all meaning to sound harsh! good luck"
