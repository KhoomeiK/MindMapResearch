I don't get sped up on meth, just focused and...boring really. Get way crazier during regular hypomanias. And if used during hypomania, it just doesn't have an effect really..(as perceived, of course it still has effects).  
Stephen Fry is a famous actor with bipolar and he used cocaine during acting to calm down while manic, or go up while depressed. Weird mechanisms.

But it was not really an argument rooted in science from his part, so to say.

intj,ewwguud,t3_cqd29p,1565827929.0,"Yeah I (INTJ) got cheated on by my (INFP) now-ex-girlfriend! She was laying in my bed cuddling with me when a friend called and told me about it. She said ""no"" and was drunk (I come from an alcoholic family) so I started to dissociate and couldn't understand anything. It all went loopy for me...eventually she admitted but treated it like nothing, it broke me in half. For the first time I trusted someone and that happens, it added to my complex-PTSD from extensive trauma. When I met her, I had just started to get better (perhaps the reason she chased me).

Anyways: I got mad and told her to leave in a stern voice, she looked very shameful and walked out. I screamed and cried and still looped very much (my stomach still churns just from recalling it). I still can't comprehend that it happened. It hit soooo strongly. Then she started to get crazy and called me 100 times, while I sat and deteriorated into nothingness. She made a friend of mine call me and they tried to convince me that it was okay, ""she was poly and didnt know"" blahblahblah. I said NO, many times. But still she persisted and even came back to my apartment and screamed her lungs out in despair (she really loved me and the cheating was some reflex of ""feeling wanted"" while drunk). Foolishly I went down after hours, because I really loved her and wanted to be with her, but I couldn't any more, she disgusted me and the knife in my heart killed me.

It turned into a ""maybe"" until I retreated and said ""no."" And she screamed her lungs out again for a long time while I sat in my room and dissociated. Nothing was ever the same after that.

Days later she messaged me and we texted further, until I agreed to at least meet her up in a sober state.  
That was my biggest mistake...it killed me, the knife in the heart still producing emotional gashes.  
She convinced me to get back together, on the premise that she doesn't drink ever again (I don't drink either).  
I said NO 1000 times, but she turned it into a yes. It feels like a kind of rape in hindsight. I'm disgusted.

What followed was 5 years of relationship, moved in with her after just a few weeks. It was some of the most wonderful and horrible thing I've experienced. She was the One, or so I thought..  
The knife never left, sliced and diced me, leaving immense pain in my chest.  
I'm pretty sure she never cheated on me again, it was a kind of goal of hers, to show me and win me over.  
But it never worked and it all turned toxic. For a period I couldn't touch her or see her since it triggered my PTSD constantly...and she came from an abusive relationship, which showed when she started to beat me (slaps that turned into fists and kicks, while screaming profanities). I could never understand how or why she could do it to me. Neither could she. And always excuses, making up, ""never again."" Then got thrown out into the cold for hours until she came to senses and cried for me to come back... Two times I feared for my life, one of them she had a knife and walked towards me as she swung it slightly beside me and played it off as ""whaat, noo, I didn't do that"" (gaslight much?).

After 4.5 years it was so fucking sour, but I had started to turn my hate into love for her, and she reversed.  
She hated herself for treating me like that. And a severe random fight later, getting punched and told horrible things, she ended it. Boom. My world broke, and I'm still broken 5 months later. Can't understand it, any of it, on an emotional level. Just days earlier she told me such beautiful things about how awesome I am and that she could never live without me, we would be together forever. Fucked me up good..

My analysis on the INFP's I know, they all have cheated on all their partners. Without telling. And a friend cheated in immoral ways like her friends sisters pregnant girlfriend (they all know each other and none told anyone).  
Fucking alcohol, and possibly that ""poly""-thing (not against it per se, if all parts are in on it etc.).

I think we INTJ's have a very hard time ridding ourselves from deep connections (this was a deep connection on another level which I or her had never ever experienced before). She seems fine and it kills me. She removed everything that had to do with me, without saying anything. Even though she told me ""I love you!"" while moving out my stuff. What the fuck?! She obviously also got deep-rooted problems, but I don't understand anything about it...

I haven't forgiven and never will. That knife is stuck. I will try to remove it with psychedelics, it has worked wonders before, just have to continue on the journey.  
But got some life-lessons out of it at least!

Hope this was interesting or informative and somewhat answered you questions.

Have some new stuff saved for later to explore (ALD-52, Eth-lad etc.).

And out of all of these my favourites are: psilocybin, LSD, DMT, mescaline, ketamine and MDMA (honorary mention 2C-B). And this is considering both how fun they are and how much healing they can induce or growth to spurt. I don't think there is a need to do anything else other than the ""classical psychedelics"" as they are called (the first 4 I mentioned) and ket + MD. Every chemical we put in our body matters, especially with the more neurotoxic ones. They can alter our genes expressions and at the worst cause illness (which I'm starting to worry about with my new-found will to live).

So take my word here and don't walk the path I did, it is seldom worth it compared to the other paths one can explore. Keeping to the well studied classics can enhance most peoples lives beyond imagination, and that is what I want to see happen before I die. A mass-scale positive transformation.

I stopped using everything (even caffeine, weed and headache medication) after recovering from my benzo abuse (7 different pills in high doses every day for 2 years). Then mescaline found me and treated me sooo, so very gently which convinced me I could go on.

And now here I am and actually just starting up my continuation of the psychedelic journey! It is fascinating and scary in the best way possible but I trust in these substances and now I also trust more in myself. I do them when I feel like it, since I don't know how bad the day is going to be. Haven't had a ""bad trip"" so far in my life, but plenty of extremely tough ones. But I seem to always take it for what it is: lessons. We get what we need and not what we want.

So in YOUR case, I'd say it depends on who you are (your whole life's collected experiences/thoughts/emotions), what you want to achieve and where you are in life.  
I think they are best saved for at least 20 years of age in our culture (other cultures have an easier time lowering this age since use of rituals and different contexts).  
But if you check out the boxes physically and psychologically I'd say go for it, as often as your mind/body tells you to do it. It is important to listen and differentiate between anxiety/jitters and ""something's wrong and I shouldn't do it today""

Standard is as often as once every 2 weeks, but if it leads to much integration you could need a much longer time between. A rule of thumb is to not trip if you haven't resolved your last trip (figured out ""the message"" it had and tried to implement it in your life). But it can also be helpful to continue a recent past trip. It all depends on so many variables.

Which is why we need some kind of spiritual growth-center for this shit. :D  
So someone could help guide people in self-empowering themselves enough to learn their own unique physical and mental functions and limits.

Holy fuck this turned into my highest wall of text ever, I think. Hope you or someone finds it useful or at least entertaining. Cheeers, one love <3"
DMT,ew2cjlp,t1_ew23fu5,1565043359.0,"Aw thanks, glad to hear you enjoyed it. :)

But not as much as everyone has their own unique type of intelligence (since there are a fixed number we all share!) but definitely that most people don't know \*which type\* of intelligence their unique selves have! You feel me? I promise I'm not trying to be nitpicking or anything, they just have wholly different implication.  
The saddest part is how it reminds of a friend I had who was intelligent in a reaaally different way, still don't know how..but I'm sure he was intelligent even though he did and said some ""stupid"" shit without any idea why) and failed in classes, relationships etc. But he thought he was retarded, he said it to me several times and it broke my heart since I knew what I saw and we could have such deep philosophical discussions. He hated himself and was abused since an early age, I think this was in the way of him seeing his true self and finding out what kind of intelligence he possessed. One day he just sold everything he had and started living in a car, even though he didn't have to. And suddenly he was gone. So this goes out to you Jonas my brother, wherever you are..

Thought it might be an interesting anecdote since this is part of what fuels my passion in spreading the word about self-empowerment, such as earlier to you!

Anyway... I'm from Northern Europe (Scandinavia) and at the moment recovering from past and recent trauma (amongst various diagnoses) so no work for me. But the rare occasions I am feeling better I have studied psychology and philosophy, was going for a Bachelor's degree in psychology when depression kicked the hell out of me and been recovering since (plus an abusive relationship which hindered my healing, all over now though).

My life has been total chaos, with all the drugs as a calm ""eye of the storm."" And when I say ""all the drugs,"" I mean ALL the drugs lol.. (75 to be exact, without counting non-recreational like SSRI's or paracetamol).  
I did not give a fuck about anything and just lived to die. Extreme alcoholism during school years, which turned into a rare alcoholic psychosis called Alcoholic Hallucinosis (0.6-0.7%% of chronic alcoholists get it). The only ""real"" psychosis I've had so far as I know, funny since it's legal. Eventually I stopped drinking around age 20-21 since it started to give me horrible migraines from just a sip (6 years without alcohol now). Buuuuut instead fell down the rabbit hole of illegal drugs (had only done alcohol, nicotine and some weed at this point).

Benzo's, opiates, stimulants..all the feel-goodchemicals for great-happy-fun-times. But it wasn't really fun times, I just fell deeper without realizing it and depression worsened by the month. I did something everyday, all day. Often mixing various substances. Then came....psychedelics (thank god) and I just still did not give a flying fuck about anything and just said ""bring it on.""  
That first mushroom trip was so weird and funny, I could not believe it. And I loved it instantly.  
Sadly it got to the level of abuse as everything else. A new chemical every week. Like me and a mate getting 500mg of 2C-B one week, doing lines and eating the shit out of it as often as possible. Then 2C-I the week after. And then mixing with other things. Such as dissociatives (another level of wonkiness haha).

I think it went on like that for 1.5-2 years since the first shroom trip. Then my GF-at-the-time went out of town for a week, so I decided that going to town on my supply of 2C-B and PCP would be a great idea!  
So me and a friend did 35mg's of 2C-B nasally and around 10 mg's of PCP under the tongue, both considered to be ""strong"" doses. Oh boy... I blacked out! Which just never happens, not even when black-out-drunk lol (always remember everything the morning after).  
And it gets worse: we both blacked out for the WHOLE WEEK. I remember doing the line, sitting in my sofa watching TV and then it's suddenly a week later with the GF coming home.... No one knows what we did, if we ate, showered or anything. So creepy! All the weed was gone though haha (think it was 10 grams which should have lasted me 1 month back then).

This is a cornerstone in turning me off of my super destructive ways and at least stopping to mix wildly. But I still deeply hated myself (just like aforementioned friend) even on days I couldn't feel the hate, y'know.  


Everything in my life is a bit hazy but still totally clear on recall. I can't pinpoint any exact point where one specific trip healed me. It was more like the whole journey. I had to do all of this and see all that which I saw, in order to be ready for what psychedelics had to show me about myself and the world.  
Now that I think of it...there was one time when I  and one friend ate 4.8g's of shrooms each, with the intention of just getting high and seeing cool visuals (not something I recommend but eh, worked for me). We had only done 1, 2, 3.5g before of this potent batch.  
My friend went on a loop, he said I something which seemed to explain everything with the universe and caused him to loop. I can't remember speaking a word, just laughing and moaning to Shpongle's ""Museums of Consciousness"" and after what felt like hours I popped a Xanax since I thought he broke and we were gonna have to sort it out. Today I regret it only slightly because all the spiritual sides stopped but visuals continued. It was the most beautiful thing I have seen. Everything swirled, moved, crawled and oscillated. The white patterns on my black blanket went like insects dancing all around but there was no fear, I felt safe. Then I moved to a mirror and watched myself (usually not recommended) and it was so funny. Everything was so fucking funny. All the years of childhood abuse just melted off and I stood there, for the first time, in my full nakedness and could accept myself. I too was beautiful. It changed me over one night, and to this day I have a lasting benefit from it in seeing my value.  
MDMA also did the same thing for me and allowed me to adress deep-rooted trauma and expel it through emotional energy (crying, screaming, shaking like an epileptic). I can't even fathom how important it is for our human race globally.

This is why I'm dedicating my life to the psychedelic path and helping others find healing. Because I've tried everything and nothing have worked except psychedelics (although I had pretty severe symptoms)."
DMT,ew20r2r,t1_ew1wkw7,1565035673.0,"Haha thanks I'll take that as a compliment :D

First of all I would like to debunk the whole IQ-business. It is severely overrated and partially started out as a way to differentiate between races, where tests were given to people who hadn't been to school and then told they were dumb etcetera. Nasty as fuck.

I'm instead a firm believer in Gardner's model of ""8 types of intelligence"" such as musical, verbal, emotional, mathematical (where IQ mostly falls under). Even adaptability to one's environment can be seen as a type of intelligence. Although I believe there to be more than 8 types, but it is definitely a good starting point!

It all comes down to how you process and store information, what you do with said information and how you reflect on past and future successes & failures (to hone and perfect skills and intellect).  
As you have stated I consider myself verbally intelligent but I can't for the life of me do more than simple maths, or play an instrument. And am deeply fascinated with especially musical intelligence, since it is something so different from my own but I can still see the work/science behind it.

With that said: You can't raise you IQ (sure some minor differences may occur but generally not possible). But you don't need to do that in order to find and strengthen your personal type of intelligence.

And to be more clever, I would boil it down to: reflect, explore, learn, practice. Find your true self and be all that you can be in this short span of a lifetime. We both need to isolate ourselves for that deep introspection and also immerse ourselves in social groups to gain perspective, all of which are means to the same ends: evolution. We are always evolving at a steady pace and even our genes can take twists & turns depending on our environment and what we do to our bodies.

Persistence and resilience makes perfect, especially in combination with purpose (but never forget to enjoy and have fun since it both makes for the best learning AND completes us as human beings).

Aaaaaand of course psychedelics! They can't ""raise intelligence"" but they can make what you already have more pronounced. Remove clutter in the brain, which can \*feel\* like getting smarter since you can process information better and with more clarity. On top of broadening perspective (like traveling, but more effective). They are the most amazing thing so far in this universe, aside from existence itself I guess.

Hope it was stimulating and the answer (or droids) you were searching for, wish you all the best. :)"
DMT,ew1w6jz,t1_ew1ulnc,1565032809.0,"It could be a clumsy expression in this context, sorry about that.
But I meant the amount of receptors in your brain and body varies greatly between people. And the more receptors = more binding sites for drugs & neurotransmitters in general.

Which is why cannabis can be bad after longterm use since it upregulates serotonin receptors, which gives you too many receptors and depression follows since there are too many receptors for serotonin to bind to and they are left ""unfulfilled"" so to speak (doesn't happen to everyone though, just a documented possibility)."
DMT,ew1s0q0,t1_ew1k37j,1565030152.0,"Sounds like something to do with receptor density or metabolism which differs between every individual. This is why I can't stand having standardized dosing advice given left and right. Myself am extremely sensitive to psychedelics and have friends whom both are sensitive and not. I think it was something like 1 in 100 who are several hundred percent more sensitive (from studies before it went illegal).

Other than that: environment influences and the most introspective journeys are gotten in silent darkness, as already pointed out. Just wanted to chime in with this angle since it is often overlooked. :)"

BPD,euswwv7,t3_ch8umt,1564015212.0,"Here's one more in a similar predicament. Sucks. It has gotten a bit better in periods but lately I've felt it again, that nagging sensation of being a fraudulent adult or something. But I feel both young and old and everything in between at the same time and separately depending on daily mood. Although this kind-of-multiple-personalities-feeling could be related to my very likely bipolarity and other issues (which I've spent the last 2 years in trying to get to see a psychiatrist about but my country's psychiatry is broken) .

Saddening and relieving that we're not alone with this. Having to grow up too fast and missing out of...everything.. it eats me up most days and can easily become soul-crushing. No childhood, no merry christmas, no glorious teenage or early adulthood. Just rampant self-destructive madness (except the odd occasions of ""normality"" which was spent in dissociation anyways so it's all a bit blurry). Family means pain, shame and guilt. Love means war, malice and hate. Everything bleeds, seethes and tears itself off of my insides to float around and randomly connect with day-to-day life and cause severe distress.

I had never thought about what to do now, after coming this far and still being alive... Like..do I regain my composure enough to try and get a job for performing unfulfilling tasks on hours of the day already ruined by insomnia from traumatic replays at night and nightmares as soon as sleep occurs. Then the whole picture surrounding all of it with bills, cleaning, socializing, doing ""what I like"" (whatever that is), de-stressing, exercise, The Future ™  of my Life ™  in preparation for Death ™ 

I can't do any of it and I've never been this alone since my only confidante in life left 4 months ago. Like I have an identity comprised of crushed up personality-shards, a collection of Me's, while being an empty vessel, a Void. Not even ""what I like"" is something I particularly relate to and ain't that a mindfuck. All I want is to get back into my first self-chosen toxic abusive family where I had to cut daily to survive. I can't understand it but there it is, I'm stuck in that family, being that person. Partly because I rejected anything related to ""family"" all of my life until She ™  came along and eventually made me reconsider. But while I grew deeper and deeper into our toxicity she pushed further and further. Even when thrown out into the icy cold and told not to return, I eventually returned. I loved her. And then it hit me. Literally. Repeatedly. Increasingly aggressively. Even as I laid there taking physical and verbal punches alike...shaking and turning dead inside, gone..even then, it was ""love"" just like when I was a child and told ""I love you"" but where actions confirmed opposites.. One time when she slapped me it sent me straight back into a flashback of my mother furiously slapping 7-year old me for trying to help out my sister (whom abused me severely through all early life). I haven't been the same since and that was the moment she ceased to be my mother emotionally, just logically and through blood. I still have a hard time connecting with her and interacting with any of these people and I think it stunts my growth to be around my abusers. But I have nowhere to go, I can't stand to live even when I don't have to work and to be even MORE isolated would surely nail my coffin. Fuck, this was enlightening for myself even as I'm typing this shit, fuck my life and the irresponsible bastards who should have protected me (bullied daily for years by both students and teachers but had no one to confide in and apparently I was ""worthless"" and didn't think it was wrong, even though knew deep down it was).

All I am, and what feels like all I ever will be, is that Void which apparently can't be treated properly. That perpetual fear slithering through my intestines. That THAT is ""love."" Which I only know logically to not be true..

Can't wrap my head around what the fuck she did to me or we did to us.

And Love/Hate remain to be inseparably intertwined like a twisted turn of fate. Continually morbid in its displays of emotional equity. Contrasted only by grey shades of dissociation, that bleak brief escape from reailty."

I hope things are figured out before joining the ""27 Club"" which has retained a sort of accomplishment-status. There's just too much suffering going on both inside and outside of my skin.

But! I am writing up a contract to hold on to which states that I may not die before age 30 is reached and multiple criteria are met (like trying out various experimental pharmacological measures I apparently can't discuss on this sub lest get warnings). And if all else fails I may again resort to disappearing into inebriation, which trumps death IMO (when it is too painful to live, that is). But until then I shall try my utmost to live a sober life and reset myself, treat past traumas and see if it IS possible to live a worthy life.

Thanks. :) I like this ""boundless love"" idea and really believe in it, but would not go as far as confirming any such ""God"" in any translatable way. Whatever God-figure there is (if any at all) I believe is beyond comprehension since the complexity of it. So the Bible reads to me more like a hymn inspired by psychedelic Scribes and continued  by believers in the psychedelic idea, which then got misinterpreted over and over through the years, and more people stop partaking in psychedelics. Then here we are, with a dead-soul society trying to awaken. It has nothing to do with any kind of based religion, not even buddhism or hinduism. But they all very likely started from a psychedelic spring.

I wonder what will happen when it it mainstreamed. Perhaps we will finally ascend unto heaven on earth, as prophesied by early psychonauts who spread the word (of their percieved far-sight) and turned it into mainstream junk since it not is something to be understood by thought alone, but by feeling and ""spirit!"" As you experience with various psychedelics in the right conditions (preferrably ritualistically/ceremonially).

So imagine a future culture with a mainstream of safe and intentional psychedelic usage. What wonders that can come out of it. Psychedelics are our key to true spirituality (although of course some can attain some level of it thorugh other practices and means but not the general public and it's sufficiently safe)."
