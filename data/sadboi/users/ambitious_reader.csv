shadowhunters,fqyipim,t3_g3pkhv,1589749222.0,"When I firs read this post (despite being flagged as a spoiler) I hadn't reached qoaad. I came back now that I k ow more about him. I haven't finished the book yet (Emma and Jules just returned from Thule). 
When we first met Ash I was really excited. I have to admit that i liked him at the beginning (mostly because of the fact that he smiled at Dru). I truly hope that spending all that time with his father did not corrupt him.

Now to the point of the post: I believe it would be quite clich√©. We had two evil Morgensterns, why would we not expect this one to be evil as well?

 I think this would be a better place for Cassie to reinforce the idea that blood doesn't make you who you are, your actions do. (We had something like this in the last TMI book when Clary picked up a Morgenstern blade at Diana's weapon shop, although I believe it would mean a lot more if Ash was a good character despite his fey and demon blood.) It would be so cool if Ash became part of Team Good."
