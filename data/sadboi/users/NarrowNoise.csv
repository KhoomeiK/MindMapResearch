From what I see, NoFap seems to have more people breaking free from porn addiction, but I don't resonate with their experiences (spending hours on end on porn) because I only spend 5 minutes on porn everyday or every other day. I don't feel like porn is negatively impacting my life, as it keeps sexual urges in check and I'm capable to take intiative in other sectors of my live. It could very much be a different mindset, environment, or brain makeup like you mentioned."

Advice,f3vlkei,t3_dif327,1571178884.0,"I don't think there's a way to stop panic attacks. SSRI's haven't helped me, so take them at your own risk. Drugs like Ativan take 15 minutes to take effect, and it's easy to OD when you're panicked. Makes sense, right?

Try and spend the least amount of time alone possible (ex. go to the library or the gym) in an attempt to restrict the timing of your panic attacks. Try to go out with loved ones or people you feel comfortable with whenever you can.

Additionally, when you do panic, rush to a bathroom or isolated area as you might be a little more comfortable there. 

It may not help, and I have NO medical experience, but unisolating yourself is an effective way, albeit not an easy one. By controlling your location based on when panic attacks are coming, you will become more aware of the condition you're in, and this knowledge and understanding of your anxiety may turn into control.

I used to be obsessed with this girl last year (couldn't get her off my mind), told her how I felt and she said she wasn't ready for something like a relationship. I sought out a guidance counselor and she helped me so much with organising my thoughts and getting me to see the obsession has a normal human being. Even to this day, it doesn't feel normal talking to my friend. One thing I can tell you is time can help you heal, but one day or another your ex will cross your mind. And it'll hurt. When it does, be there for yourself.

I hope you pull through with work and school. I'm sure you're a great person since your sales are through the roof."
