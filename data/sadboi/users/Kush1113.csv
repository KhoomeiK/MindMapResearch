My levels have been all over the place, and I’m getting ferritin shots.  What a relief to know that it can be corrected."

Today I yold him enough is enough--get on the damn phone right now, put it on speaker, and stop being a damn coward.  He did it, but I guarantee that the walk he took right after that conversation was spent telling them that I'm the problem.  Never trust a coward."

It's never enough and they will try to tear you down because they feel bad about themselves.  What changed for me is that I realized they are a big part of the problem.  I have gone out of my way to act ""normal"" and pretend everything is okay when it's not.  They do not deserve to have you in their lives and if you ever need to talk, feel free to message me. My advice is to ignore them, disconnect, and do something good for yourself that makes you feel better."

I had everything else--and I had a serious case that sent me to the hospital four times.  My lungs were fine, but my oxygen saturation levels were only around 84%. My heart was beating so fast  (130 resting) and I literally had no idea what was going on.  I'd come to and everyone would clap, and I was like ""where the hell am I?""

I have a hematologist now who is monitoring all of my levels, and by the end of it, I was severely nutrient deficient.  He has me on a special multivitamin and I'm getting ferritin shots on a weekly basis.  But, I wasn't eating.  It literally never crossed my mind.  It's really just a long blur and I can't believe it's May already!  My doctor told me I will have to take a high quality multivitamin for the rest of my life.  I'm okay with that.  I'd much rather load up on vitamins in hopes that my immune system can fight off illnesses.  I had influenza A right before, which did not help things.  It's scary, but rest as much as you can, do what your doctor says...based on what I've seen, recovery takes a few weeks for most people.  Diabetes, heart disease, and any underlying condition can impact your recovery time.  Drink a lot of electrolyte replacement fluids like Gatorade."
Assistance,fqoj6pk,t3_gk0zlm,1589516462.0,"It's different for everyone, but most people are able to recover at home.  I have an underlying health condition (type 1 diabetes) and it lasted months.  I had some extremely strange symptoms, too, like peeling skin.  I went to the hospital four times because my husband couldn't get me to wake up.  The shortness of breath was not that bad at all.  No one in my family got it.  I was the only one.  I don't remember most of it.  My husband would find me in random places in the house passed out.  It was scary, especially for them.  I know about twenty people now who have had it and they all had mild, flu-like symptoms that lasted just a few weeks.  They are totally back to normal now.  My parents both had it and they are in their seventies.  Both of them are doing fine now, too.  It's a very strange illness and affects everyone differently.  Most people get a mild version.  If you have immune issues, it might linger or cause other issues.  What medicine did you get for it?  Of all things they tried, vitamin d and zinc helped me the most."

I'll see if it's still up on FB and get the link.
