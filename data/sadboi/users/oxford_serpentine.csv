Cymbalta withdrawal hell is a thing. It can't be compounded because it's too unstable. Ironic eh? 

I took it for depression and had the worst withdrawal symptoms that my psych Dr had ever seen. I had a plan and everything and was crying because of it. I lost time while withdrawing from and had to be medically excused from work due to the symptoms especially the rage part. There was no in between you just went straight to rage. 

The hardest part of the withdrawal is that it has a short half life. My dr offered me to taper down by using Prozac but I have had a bad reaction to ssris. BTW the half life of Prozac is 2 weeks.

Seek out a psych Dr."

Bring old underwear that you don't care for anymore. Instead of using the special post surgery underwear the hospital used mine.

As for anxiety, I have it too and the painkillers treated it nicely without using my prescribed meds.

Make sure that your clothing is easy to to put on and comfy. Legging and sweatpants are your new best friends. 

Bring hygiene items with you. 

Also Check with the hospital in what to bring. You don't need tons of stuff just the immediate stuff."
