I seriously value my friendships so, when they do ‘confess’ to me, I feel betrayed. It’s caused trust issues over time. I’ve always thought it must be something I’m doing wrong, maybe I’m too open? My boundaries not defined?? 
When I have found strength/patience to have conversation past ‘the confession’, I’m told it’s my personality, my passion when I speak so ??? How do I make friends (especially guy friends) without showing who I am ? Idk I’m stumped here :/"
