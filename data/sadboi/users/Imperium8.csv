Superman admitted that that even though he knew what was at stake, every time he hit Shazam he couldn't shake the image of Billy in his head, and Superman was afraid to hurt him. Because of this Superman held back even if didn't want to. I think this shows us that there can't be a fair fight between the two because the morals that Superman stands for will always get in the way. You might argue that he wouldn't hold back under mind control, but by controlling Superman's mind you rob him of his values, thereby stripping him of his biggest strengths. It kind of becomes a sort of paradox. I would still consider Superman more powerful individually, but head to head I think Shazam will almost always come out on top except for cases where the story demands Superman to win."

But in all seriousness I also feel the same way. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2017 but never heard about this game until this summer. I bought it immediately but then put off playing it because I got nervous that playing it would make my symptoms worse. When I finally did play it I immediately fell in love with it. I had been trying for so long to find a way to describe to people what I felt like to have schizophrenia but nothing really worked. Books and movies can't really portray the experience so the best thing I had were YouTube video simulations, but even those weren't the same because you're watching things happen in first person, but they're not really happening to you. The fact that you control Senua and that the voices respond to your actions made this so real. I foundcomfort seeing this portrayed in Senua. As she came to accept her psychosis, I felt like she was showing me the way to accept my own. I haven't actually shown this game to anybody as a way of demonstrating what my experiences are like, but if anyone ever asked me what it is like I'd definitely show them this game."
PCOS,faoyz5q,t3_ea8tmt,1576275828.0,"Hi, I'm a guy on this subreddit so I can learn how to best support my girlfriend. She first told me about her diagnosis shortly after we started dating. She was showing me old photos of herself in highschool and mentioned that she hated them because of the extra hair she used to have on her sideburns. From there she told me about going to the doctor and about her diagnosis. I had never heard about it but she told me how devastated she was as a junior in high school to hear her doctor say that she couldn't get pregnant. I could tell that it still bothered her so I tried to reassure her that as much as I would like kids sometime in the future, I was dating her for who she is, not so that she can bear me children. Besides, it's still a possibility with hormone treatments, and if not we can adopt. I've learned more about her other symptoms over time and I've tried to help her cope with them the best I can. It can be challenging when she misses her period for over a month and we start to wonder if she's pregnant and whether we're ready for that or whether we should be happy and see it as a miracle. But I love her, and this diagnosis isn't going to scare me away. I'm confident that if you find someone who cares for you, they'll stick around too."

AskReddit,f8eg9om,t3_e0jotr,1574527020.0,"Unpopular opinion here but I was born in Mexico and immigrated to the United States as a child. I think I am lucky to have been born in an other less fortunate country because it gives me a different perspective to America's political turmoil. Americans always report the news like what ever is happening at the moment is the absolute worst thing that could happen. From Bush being an incompetent idiot, to Obama being Big Brother, to Trump being a dictator. What Americans don't realize is how tame their politics really are. While congress is considering to impeach Trump over quid pro quo with Ukraine, Mexico's previous president Ernesto Peña Nieto is widely believed to have been involved in ""disappearance"" of 43 student protestors in Ayotzinapa in 2014 who were arrested by local police and handed over to the cartel to be tortured and executed. In Venezuela the current (?) president Nicolás Maduro dissolved congress when they wouldn't agree with him and replaced it with a congress composed soley of his political allies. These things make whatever Trump has or hasn't done seem tame in comparison. 
As for the con, the violence in some parts of Mexico has gotten so bad, that when an aunt passed away last year my family was unable to attend her funeral because our family told us that the local cartel had a heavy presence and would probably kidnap us since we're ""Americans"".
