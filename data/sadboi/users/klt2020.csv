I tend to sing a lot or quote Disney lines without thinking sometimes so I couldn’t be quite that long. Plus I wouldn’t do well in darkness for so long without being able to relieve my boredom. And I would hate not eating real. This would be absolute torture for and I’m a self proclaimed introvert so that’s really saying something."
CasualConversation,fmdprmk,t3_fuk8qf,1585974269.0,Hopefully this will open up the conversation that internet should be more accessible and affordable to the masses especially since schools and universities had to shift to being strictly online in the US.

CasualConversation,fmcjqy3,t1_fmbks8f,1585947010.0,- In the same kind of boat and have definitely had those same thoughts of why aren’t people reaching out even more during this time. I hope people reach out soon to you and that you’re able to make fiends somehow during all of this.
CasualConversation,fmceup3,t3_fu1jcs,1585944315.0,I’m so glad I’m not the only one that feels like this. My current best friends have closer best friends. I really miss having someone be my person especially when tough stuff happens.
