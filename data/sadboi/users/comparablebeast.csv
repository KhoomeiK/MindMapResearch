Meditation at the end that’s a bit more than 1 minute is nice for me, I like themes because it gives my mind something else to focus on and revert back to....

But what’s made a class worthwhile for me is an instructor who makes eye contact. I’ve noticed that some instructors slide into their routine of being instructor, starting class and it feels like we’re just getting the whole yoga-as-an-exercise-of-mental-and-spiritual-calm (among other things) started so we can end it and it takes me out of the moment.

So please fuck off to the furthest corner of the Internet and WAKE UP....civic duty or not, it’s not everyone’s priority. It wasn’t mine even in light of how I was 6,5,4,3,2,1 year(s) ago and it’s honestly not mine now. I’ll leave it at that."

And it was only after a convo with my mom about primaries (on 2/24) that I realized I needed to register but by then it was too late for my state (needed to register before 2/10). So I missed it by a whole two weeks and at that point, I didn’t give a single fuck anymore about what happened in the presidential election anymore. I was ignorant before (though leaning towards Sanders because I followed him *the most* without actually following the presidential race) and ill stay ignorant. Apathy runs deep dude and I have zero hope for our future, even with Bernie and that’s kind of independent of my own failing to register to vote in time.

If you’re unsure, you could try an indica-dominant hybrid if you want to mellow yourself out or a sativas-dom hybrid if you want a more middle-ground experience.

vegan,fiv22y3,t1_fiuom56,1582752421.0,"How is that false hope though? If animals don’t know any better, how is that false hope? I’d argue that we are in the same predicament, many people who exist in this world today are living in a sense of false hope and have no reason to believe anything concrete about their lives until it happens to them and they’re experiencing it in the flesh. I don’t think anyone brainwashed us to believe eating flesh was right or wrong, governments didn’t exist the way they do now at the start of the era meat consumption in Homo sapiens and it’s a trend that’s been ever evolving, although I can admit that there is heavy influence on what we eat because of government entities...but I don’t think it’s as cut and dry as the government specifically and unilaterally deciding for our ancestors that we should kill other animals for sustenance. 

I am definitely for the argument that the practice of animal agriculture is something worth amending, a practice that isn’t the most balanced it could be but I do not think it’s inherently wrong to kill other beings. Call me crazy but I think since death is naturally occurring, the opposite side of the coin of life, there is validity to it and when it comes to eating “our own kind”, I’m not gonna be mad at a moose or hyena or whatever kind of animal that kills me or anyone else for whatever reason, the same reason I’m not mad at a human killing another animal.

I certainly don’t see anything not normal with the death of anything or anyone...but that’s where we differ. 

I say this as a fallen-off-the-wagon vegan but plant based person for 10+ years now.

I have this sick joke going with myself where I repeat this ""mantra"" that goes ""there's fun to be found in doing things just for the fun of it--just because"" and I have yet to find fun in doing things just because. Going to a park no longer does shit for me. Going outside fucking sucks. Yoga fucking sucks. Making a whole ass meal fucking sucks...calling my friends suck ass. Seeing my family sucks ass. 

If it's me that is making everything seem terrible, I can handle that and I can accept that as truth and say sayonara to everything, while accepting that I'm to blame for the bullshit way I see things and give up trying to find a loophole through my misery. If the way I see things is actually because everything is so depressing and I don't have rose-colored glasses for life, then I'll accept that too...but like, universe...kill me off at least. Why make me miserable with you? And if you can't kill me off then give me the strength to do it myself. 

I hate asking. Maybe it's futile to ask you of anything. Been asking you for some relief, some peace, some contentment....some guidance....something that means something to me. A gift isn't a gift if it's an actual detriment to the receiver...and you keep giving me shit. Give me what I ask for maybe? To never wake up again, to check out of this hotel room in hell forever?

I should expect nothing more from you. You can't give me greatness and you also seem to not be able to give me death. Why even try to reason with you anymore....

My plan is to overdose. I've been stockpiling drugs of all kinds from some people I know and my plan is to get so wasted out of my mind that there is no second-guessing...that I get so belligerently reckless that I don't stop to think about anything that could keep me here, that it takes away any inclination towards self-preservation. I want to stop feeling, I want to feel my body and soul break away from each other and know I never have to consider a single thing that I ever once experienced in this life. I want to do it but I just haven’t been able to and it fucking sucks...

I want bile to consume me, pain to swallow me and the perception of consciousness to subside. 

SO FUCKING DONE."

ThriftStoreHauls,fiiftku,t1_fiiepg6,1582420993.0,Thanks for the excitement! I definitely feel like this was my best find to date and it’s a 2012 edition. Night and day difference using a textbook (familiar format) than second-guessing which online tools were the best and not understanding the concepts because it felt either too deep or not deep enough. Really excited to learn this. Good luck to you finding your Python book! I found this at a thrift close to a nearby college in my area. You may have better luck going to one near a campus...

So whether you’re trying to find relationships or looking to vet a potential one, a massively helpful tool is the Internet and since so many people are on it, it makes sense why so many ppl recommend it..."

Yo, I feel you on that. It doesn’t happen regularly enough but on heavier days of discharge, I don’t even want to leave the house because I hate feeling like I’m sitting in it. Makes me uncomfortable...

But I use liners. Toilet paper makes me feel uncomfortable due to it bunching up and constantly shifting. You aren’t alone though! Keep doing you, if TP works for you more power to you"

depression,fi4lwcr,t3_exo6f1,1582143826.0,"Called out of work again for today....probably going to get fired. Can’t hold a job, can’t do anything right and everything is so hard...I fucking can’t stand the reality of life and no amount of inner-searching is going to help change the fact that it’s going to suck to wake up everyday knowing that you have to get out of bed for money...

Not family or inner growth, spirituality...or ramen noodles or your friend’s dinner party...that it all has to come second to a job.

Reason to off myself now. Then I’ll never have to complain about something I can’t change."

I hate this shit. In theory, the idea of having 3 days off totally rocks but when you realize you have zero energy by the time your off-days come, it gets old real quick"
