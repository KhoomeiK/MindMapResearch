onlyfansadvice,fqvk7p7,t3_gl5zyr,1589679046.0,"I have a couple thoughts here.

1. You are absolutely entitled to charge whatever you want for whatever content you want. I know some people who charge 30/month and don't even do nudes.
2. I would try to be clear in your bio/promos what you DO get with your subscription. Saying, for example, ""nude content"" and then not providing nude content with a subscription is a bit scammy to me. (Not accusing you of this but as I can't see your content, I'm just providing an example). There will always be assholes who complain so being as transparent as you can about what they get for their price (not any additional charge) is important.
3. Big picture, 16 is probably higher than average cost to include a lot of upselling. Again, it's totally appropriate to do whatever you can and whatever you feel is right, but most accounts will charge 2-7 for a monthly subscription and then do mostly upselling. Some, on the otherhand, charge more and do less upselling (I do 10/month and make everything accessible for all of my subscribers). So, you are probably a bit of an outlier if you're doing a lot of upselling. Again, I don't know your content and you are definitely allowed to do whatever you want, just some thoughts. I say if people are paying, keep it up!"

AskRedditAfterDark,fqv8pt7,t1_fqv30le,1589672141.0,"Thanks for your thoughtful questions.

&#x200B;

1. Do you mean what made me want to start doing sex work in general? (I used other plaftforms before onlyfans). I have been fairly popular on social media for some time and saw there was a demand for it. I really started because I thought it would be a fun way to get to know myself sexually and be more confident sexually.
2. Nope! Sometimes it was hard to deal with some of the nasty degrading things people can say or do, and that's one of the hazards of the job, but it's something I've learned to navigate over the past several years.
3. I don't disagree with prostitution, so I wouldn't try to argue against it. People supply services that are in demand and get paid for those services. (Like a masseuse, for example). It can be emotionally complicated for some people because sex is involved, but it's still just a service (or in my case, a product). Women will send nudes regardless. They're often pressured into it and many of them do it for validation (which is unhealthy). Many times these men will then ditch them or use them or send the nudes around (not always obviously, but it happens to everyone at least once or twice). So, to me, it feels better to know I am being paid for my time and effort and not just being used with no compensation. (Obv. if I'm really sexually interested in someone I don't want them to pay, but tbh, most girls who send nudes do it because they get worn down by begging). I'm really feminist, and I see how the sex work industry can be perceived as objectifying women. However, I don't see that as an issue inherent in the industry and more of an issue of how it's being run. This is why it's super important to me to have women voices in the industry. There are some 'feminists' who are just anti-sex in general and I just don't agree with that. 
4. I enjoy it! But I enjoy it like a fun job. I wouldn't do it if I didn't get paid."

AskRedditAfterDark,fqv0gsa,t3_gl3gea,1589667414.0,"Hi. I'm an onlyfans creator and have a couple of thoughts.

1. Totally agree that spam has gotten way out of hand. It's really obnoxious and mods are working hard to get rid of a lot of it. However, it'll probably die down and newbie content creators get bored of it and quarantine ends, so don't worry.
2. I don't think you should feel negatively about the platform as a whole just because some of the creators spam ads. There's a large percentage of us that don't (obviously you don't see us because we're quiet..I know it's easier to see the more obnoxious people). With death threats, dox threats, etc. toward us every day, it hurts to see some people say that hate the platform just because of spam (just something to think about). I think it's important to be nuanced here.
3. It is a cry for money; onlyfans is literally a selling platform.
4. I think everyone is entitled to post what they want on their onlyfans, whether that's full length pornos or just suggestive/lewd pictures. However, some creators imply to potential subscribers that they post nudes, etc. (or straight up tell them they do) and it turns out they don't. This is why it's super important to me that I'm transparent about what I post and how much I post, so no one is disappointed. More communication is always better and some people aren't great at that. This is also why it's good to subscribe to longstanding accounts or people who have done online sex work for a while (more reliable).
5. Most of my subscribers are older businessmen who want something more personal than porn but don't have the time for a full blown relationship (that's where our niche lies and why people are willing to pay). Additionally, some people really like amateur porn!

Anyway, hope these thoughts help!"
