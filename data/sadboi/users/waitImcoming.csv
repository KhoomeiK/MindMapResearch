almosthomeless,fpcnp3l,t3_gcp2x2,1588507225.0,God that sounds so rough. I am sorry you are in such a bad situation. It's totally normal to feel exhausted and hopeless. Anyone would. Don't be hard on yourself for it. We all go through hard spots in life and at those times it's almost impossible to remember the good times. Like literally your brain focuses in on only the bad and Can Not remember the good. So ride it out. Don't let depression win. You are worth it. Take one moment at a time and tell the voice inside you telling you all thr lies and tearing you down to fucking shut up. Because there are good times waiting for you and you are a beautiful worthy soul with much to give.

I am returning back after 3 years once I find a flight and have secured a part time job. Can't really imagine returning to full time work nor do I want to return for good. More like a stopover for some months up to a year or two. The roof started leaking. 

If you do try and pull something like this off be prepared also for needing the money to fix things of they break. So you always need am emergency house fund. Also I recommend having a good friend who knows hoe to fix things willing to do work on an hourly wage whenever it is needed. Like handing over keys to a new tenant, fixing minor things etc."
TinyHouses,fos7mxf,t1_flk29le,1588025442.0,"I bought a very old and badly maintained small house in a place where there is always demand for apartments. I fixed it up as 2 apartments and lived in one of them till I left my safe government job to go see the world.

When I left I had one apartment paying the mortgage and the other was my monthly salary. Not much money but enough to survive in cheaper countries. 

Alternatively if you could build 2 tiny houses and live in one you could do this. Depends on where in the world you are and if you can find land where it's reliable to rent out. 

But I was also just lucky. I got the house for little money considering location, was lucky enough to be able to get a mortgage. Lucky enough to have low student loan payments etc. 

So I wouldn't say I was rich at all (making about $40k per year with the mortgage about $160k and student loans around $60k) but it really depends on what you compare me to.

A friend told me that in Moscow it's all on2 although I would reconfirm it if its relevant to you. Maybe reach out to one of the schools in the region.

I dance the sensual kind and it's funny, I don't feel it's intimate at all anymore. Just like salsa I am just on my toes trying to follow the cues and what looks like grinding is the most challenging for me to follow as it requires me to slow down and really listen and move either upper or lower body instead of just stepping to the beat. 

But despite my deep love for bachata y really missed salsa when I went to bachata congresses. My preferred mix is 50-50.

But I think you will fit in just fine wearing leggings and a crop or loose top.

Salsa,fj1qjij,t1_fj1o9k5,1582925580.0,"I am also a follow. I have unfortunately never danced in the US (yet) so I cannot really do a comparison but I can describe what I do and have seen. As for what to wear it of course depends on what you normally wear. I usually dance wearing all black to hide sweat.. jeans and top and prefer buying 2 of the same tops so if I need to change once one is soaked I have an exact same one in my bag. But that's a personal preference and I don't know anyone else who does! I often wear dresses too with leggings. If I had the body for it I would def wear crop tops. 

In Germany I found the follows dressed less flashy than for example in Eastern Europe. It reflects the culture.. Eastern European women are much more prone to going all out with makeup, shoes, hair, nails than their mainland European counterparts.

As for the crowds, most anywhere people are friendly but unless you are super good looking and or super talented you might not be asked non stop to dance. It was a bit of a shock the first times I danced outside my local group where I knew everyone and could dance without a stop the whole night. I have found it much easier to get dances in a new location where I don't have any leader friends in the crowd if I join a class. Many places will have a drop in class at the beginning of the night. In my experience I am asked more often to dance at local social nights than at congress socials. But anywhere that you are an outsider you will often need to ask rather than wait to be asked. 

To get a better idea of the typical dance outfits and dance style search for the fb groups for the congress or club for the socials. Might also find pics etc if you find a fb page for the salsa school hosting the nights. 

Another thing to consider is that different places have different concentrations of on1, cuban vs la style etc."

Families take care of each other and that's what you have done. Your sisters untreated mental health problems have become your responsibility, which you naturally don't really want.

If you continue to take care of her eating she has no reason to face her problem. Your parents should probably have dealt with this when she was younger.

I used to work with high functioning teens with Aspergers. Your sister reminds me a bit of them, but more info is needed. Another possibility is OCD focused on eating and food. 

You might want to read a bit about the above mentioned disorders, googling it as OCD + picky eating or Aspergers + eating disorder etc. 

You seem like a caring sister who has taken a bit too much responsibility for your sister and that only leads to resentment. You need to set clear boundaries, become very clear with what you are willing to do; which is what you know is sustainable and will not get you tired and pissed off with your sis.
