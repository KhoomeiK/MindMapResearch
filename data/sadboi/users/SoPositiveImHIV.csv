How many hots?"
BPD,fkgaf23,t1_fkei5kv,1584154095.0,I’d like to give you one internet hug. I can relate so hard right now that it’s making me rethink my habits.
amiugly,fk2fcn3,t3_fg1lui,1583799806.0,"Not ugly whatsoever. Cute smile. Once you break more and more out of your shell it would be nice to see some of those pearly whites :D

I’m proud of you for being so brave! I, for one, am too afraid to see what people think of me lol."
toastme,fk2f6i4,t3_ffxn07,1583799695.0,"You’re killing it, dude! Plus, you’re hella handsome so you have that and so much more going for you!"

I hope less tears and more laughs are in your future :D"

You deserve to be happy in life. Remember that."

Diablo,ffjntcz,t3_etyybv,1580002552.0,"Unfortunately, no. Running GRs are the best way to level up, as the XP raises exponentially the higher you go. 

Given that I don’t know the specifics of your build, I’d encourage you to continue running GRs, as high as your build allows, to level your three primary gems. If you’re struggling with dealing more damage and/or survivability, I’d also encourage you to check out websites like [Icy-Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/d3/). I hope this helps! I’m happy to answer any other questions you may have. 

Back to the grind! :3"
Diablo3Wizards,ffelp5c,t3_epoiey,1579853391.0,As close to 60% as you can get is a good rule of thumb. You’ll notice just how useful it is when you can go from 50-52 to 54-56 (or higher). Really makes a big difference when trying to get back into archon when you have little wiggle room to dodge around with.
