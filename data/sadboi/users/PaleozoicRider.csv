Planting incriminating evidence on myself and others, telling them I want to die, telling them I want them to die, real scum of the earth shit. 

All in the pursuit of getting people to actually *want* me dead, or at least not mourn my passing.

2-3 years I kept that up. Unfortunately I seem to have a talent for picking clever friends and, having family members of the same sort, everyone consistently saw through the veil of lies I had created. They knew it wasn't me, and I was the only one that believed it.

Long story short, just because you're the only one who has these thoughts doesn't make them who you are. Ergo, you're not a bad person, you're depressed like the rest of us. And banking on the earlier point of ""you are not your thoughts"", you can be only certain of one thing: You're the only one who has verifiable thoughts about your suicide. Others might imply it in behaviour and words, but you have no way of knowing to what extent this is.

I'm getting therapy to sort it so it's not like I'm just playing the victim card every chance I get. But here's an example of where it wouldn't be my responsibility to avoid certain scenarios:

I'm epileptic (this is relevant). I'm sure you know what this condition is. Photosensitivity, the works. Any bright flashing light has a good chance of giving me a seizure. I take meds for it which controls it somewhat, but I can still get them. Is it too much to ask, that people be considerate, and turn off the flash on their cameras? Or not take hundreds of selfies at the movie theater (where the whole room is dark)? So what are my options? Am I just supposed to not go to the movies or have my picture taken? Ever? No, I politely ask people to be considerate, and they cooperate.

None of my conditions are my own conscious fault, especially the epilepsy, and although this doesn't absolve me of responsibility, it doesn't absolve the people around me either. Everyone has to make a sacrifice to accommodate. It's not everyone *else's* job sure, but it is *everyone's* job.
