BipolarReddit,f20yt7r,t1_f1yu4o8,1569865715.0,thank you! i’m still doubting my diagnosis a lot and it’s almost like i want proof one way or the other. but i’m on bipolar meds and they seem to be helping. i’m also getting started up with a regular pdoc in november. maybe i’ll figure it out then. i was also under immense stress when the episode happened so you’re right about that lmao

BipolarReddit,f1yro70,t1_ey4n8cb,1569822930.0,was that the first time you experienced mania? and did you begin to have more episodes as time went on?

i’ve also looked into BPD but i don’t think i have that as i don’t match any of the symptoms except for mood swings. so it’s been a little hard to understand.

thank you for your response :)"
bipolar,euux0y5,t1_euu80ss,1564052056.0,The thing that bothers me is that I probably wouldn’t have recognized it if it’s happened before. I only really noticed this time because it was a dramatic shift from deep depression.
