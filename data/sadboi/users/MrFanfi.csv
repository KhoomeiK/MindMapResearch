bipolar,fi6p62t,t3_f6rqu3,1582203568.0,During this last month I’ve heard a couple of really uninformed comments regarding Bipolar Disorder.

It seems as if people want to seem quirky and special with something that is a living hell to others. I just hope in the future people would understand what they are actually talking about.
