As an adult you really have to advocate for yourself and your needs. For example, ask your GP where they referred you to and if you dont hear from that office, call ask ask about the status of your referral. Or if you dont need a referral, contact offices on your own. And keep calling back (not like stalking ... Just friendly and businesslike). 

I personally HATE doing this but working inside the system I know that I have to. (I'm not a psychiatrist or therapist - I work in an administrative field.) If you have questions I can try to answer them. Don't give up on yourself!"

He is fine with that. I am NOT handling it well, splitting multiple times a day, getting very angry at him, wanting him to just go away. I know this is wrong and unfair to him. I'm not only hurting his feelings, im also very ashamed of myself,  which makes my emotions more intense and negative.

Changed careers - began working a (now I know) very fucked-up place.

Boss 1: after 3 months she begins bullying me, criticizing me over everything. Not my work, but my personality traits and behaviors. I hate myself more than ever.

A year or so later, coworker 1 (who i've confided to) uses me to help overthrow the Boss 1. She becomes Boss 2. 

Boss 2 (who I now know is a narcissist and possibly worse) uses the info she knows about me and my mental health disorders to start abusing me. Criticising my lack of social skills and behavior. Tries to get me fired. I believe all the shit she says about me and enter a dark time - barely left the house other than work for two years because I was so ashamed of myself. Couldn't look for a new job because I believed what she said about me was true and thought no one would ever hire me again.

After five years of this, I get a new supervisor who is fucking normal. She compliments me all the time and just gave me an excellent annual review.

I know now I'm not the hopeless fuckup bosses 1 and 2 made me think I was. Boss 2 is still my department head and making work life miserable for me, but I have enough self-worth now that I've started my new job search and hope to be out of there asap.

Things that are helping me now:
Realizing these people do not get to define me
Knowing they're fucked up too
Taking pride in myself that I would never treat an employee like that
Realizing it's my life and I don't have to put up with this shit anymore
Trying to remember that work does not define who I am
Knowing they do this in part because they're miserable themselves
Trying to forgive myself for being ""willing"" to be abused
Despite what they told me, I am a strong person

The most fucked up part in my story is that my employer is a mental health agency.

Not sure if this helps but thanks for letting me vent. Best luck to you!"
