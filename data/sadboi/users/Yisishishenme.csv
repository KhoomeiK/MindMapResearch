We might do it to feel a sense that when we die, part of us will live on through our children. We might have children for purely personal self-interested reasons, too, because we think having a family will make us happy and fulfilled, which it does for many people. The argument loses its force, I think, given that it tries to attack a domain of human life which is always going to exist and which is by nature not based on logical reasoning. I think Benatar acknowledges that his philosophy will not stop people from having children, but just to point out that it’s not morally defensible."

Buddhism,fd2fj2o,t1_fctmvwz,1578146478.0,"I think you’re right that my experience with western philosophy definitely influences my interpretation. I took a class on metaphysics which was mostly contemporary analytic philosophy. I got the idea from reading philosophers like Hilary Putnam that there is no reality beyond our concepts, or any pre-cognitive encounter with “suchness” as Buddha might say. But perhaps a direct experiential understanding would say otherwise. 

I just find it strange that the fact we are talking about emptiness shows that it is in some sense a concept, or it can at least be made into a concept for purposes of discussion. Having a non-conceptual encounter or understanding of emptiness seems difficult to grasp for me. But maybe it’s something that meant to arise naturally in a meditative state."
Buddhism,fct4vt7,t1_fct2edw,1577932944.0,"Hmm, yeah that makes sense. Buddhism is interesting because it does on its surface have the perennial appearance/reality distinction that you see in a lot of western philosophy like Plato and Kant, but it does away with the ultimate reality entirely. From what you’re saying, the apprehension of “ultimate reality” is  brought down to the level of conventional appearance. Although is it still a more privileged appearance because it results in less delusion and ignorance, and therefore less suffering? 

I guess I struggle with that infinite regression that you brought up, which to me is almost more logically counterintuitive than positing emptiness as existing. Doesn’t the chain have to stop somewhere, at some base level emptiness? If it doesn’t stop then does the infinite chain exist? I guess it’s meant to be paradoxical; and Buddha himself advised against pondering and debating metaphysics, as it detracts from eliminating suffering and maybe even adds to it! Haha."

Buddhism,fcsyaby,t1_fcpck2u,1577928149.0,"How are they not the same emptiness? If the statement “everything is empty” is true, then it seems like “emptiness is everything” is also true.

It’s not an emptiness that “pervades” everything, but both the chair and the book are alike in being empty; they are both participating in the reality of “emptiness,” I guess.

Although Parfit doesn’t talk about this, the logical consequence of the bundle theory is that there is no subject/object distinction, no “you”and “me.” This is like the no-self idea in Buddhism, and in Hinduism there’s also an idea that the “inner self” or Atman is identical with Brahman, which is “the one” or all of existence (aka God)."

Neuropsychology,f7kmbus,t3_dwh0ew,1573817925.0,"The fundamental questions will probably be answered with philosophy in conjunction with neuroscience. The problems you might be referring to: the nature of consciousness, and whether or not we have free will, for example, might be able to be informed by neuroscientific findings but they probably involve some philosophical speculation, as well. There are two competing views of the mind-brain relation: the identity theory, which says that every mental event, every thought, emotion, etc, is identical to an exact physical event in the brain. Then there is the neural correlate view, which says that mental events may have varying physical instantiations; they might not have a one-to- one correspondence with physical events. This view seems more plausible. 

As of now, though, we can’t locate the “content” of specific mental events in the brain. For example, we can’t tell if someone believes that Trump is a good president by looking at their brain chemistry. The content of beliefs and emotions has yet to be correlated with neural firing in the brain. Which isn’t to say we can’t accomplish this eventually; I think our technology and measurements aren’t precise enough yet."

Let’s say: 1) in order for an agent to be responsible for an action x, he must be responsible for the cause of x.
2) The causal history of x will always predate the agent’s existence.
3) Therefore, the agent can not be responsible for any action.”  
How is that based on a modal fallacy? Seems like a simple observation that nothing can be causa sui— the cause of itself.

But if the hard determinist claims that we can exercise control and causally influence future events, isn’t he also implying that we could choose not to (in the earthquake example, I could choose to sit and do nothing). So isn’t the hard determinist slipping into compatibilism here in admitting that we can freely choose to exercise control over our actions? Is there really a difference between this kind of free will and the metaphysical free will that the hard determinist claims we lack? To me it seems like if we take the absence of free will seriously it would logically entail that we accept fatalism."
askphilosophy,f59hy9m,t1_f58uh5i,1572089570.0,"Yeah, absurdities like that kind of make it hard to accept total panpsychism (it’s hard enough to imagine a rock or an electron as being conscious).  I like the idea of a Spinozistic monism in that “mind” and “matter” are two ways of describing or conceptualizing the same thing. Spinoza might not be right that consciousness and matter are two metaphysical “attributes” of a single substance, each with two distinct causal streams, but they might be two equally accurate conceptualizations of reality. In other words once a system reaches a certain level of complexity, it is correct to call it “conscious,” but consciousness itself might not be a mysterious epiphenomenon. To say a being has consciousness is just a way of describing a certain complex physical system; the physical and mental are actually identical. I hope that makes sense."

This is simply because nothing can be empirically verified to be definitively “wrong” or “right” in philosophy.

Chalmers calls the “easy problem” the task of explaining how phenomenal experience arises from physical processes (although he acknowledges that the easy problem is quite hard!) The “hard” problem, on the other hand, is why should consciousness accompany physical processes at all? Given all the physical facts about my brain and nervous system, there’s nothing about these facts that logically entail the phenomenal properties that accompany them. In other words, answering the easy problems will not answer the question of why I am conscious in the first place."

We can find is no unified field of experience when we observe the neural activity actually happening in the brain. 

His view seems contradictory though; if my subjective experience really didn’t exist at all, wouldn’t the lights be off for me completely? Wouldn’t I be a zombie with no real internal perceptions or emotions?

askphilosophy,f12vgco,t1_f0ytuyd,1569147463.0,"Thanks for your reply. My confusion also comes from the difference in Spinoza’s system between an attribute and a mode, I think. When he talks about “the mind” am I correct in saying that he thinks of “the mind” as a distinct mode which falls under the attribute of thought? And that “the body” is also a mode under the attribute of extension? If this is so, then we can have a clear and distinct idea of the mind as a mode within the infinite attribute of thought, or the body as a mode within the attribute of extension, despite the fact that actual experience tends to blur the two? 

I guess I’m having trouble seeing how our ideas of mind and body as they arise from experience can at once be inadequate and yet through reason we can separate ourselves from our own experience and form a true conception of mind and body as distinct modes. How is Spinoza sure that mind and body are distinct modes if they seem to interact to such an extent in empirical experience? As you pointed out, he has a monist metaphysics; mind and body are both aspects of the same substance. But when he makes claims about THE mind or THE body, he seems to be saying that these are distinct objects, or modes, that have their own individual essences, almost as if they are  distinct after all, so that’s why I’m a bit confused. I might have to go back and reread some of part one to clarify what a “mode” is."

We don’t think that he had an random brain impulse that spurred his body to move toward the vending machine; we assume he had a clear intention to purchase the candy.
