Here's the thing that helped me:

**You are wanted! Don't let anxiety tell you otherwise.**

&#x200B;

You should look for groups of people with similar interests on Discord or where ever. I also found that work massively helped me! Try and keep your mind preoccupied with something that you love doing!"

They are fully aware of this being a trigger.

I totally respect and understand that people can be busy, I don't feel that I'm being a nuisance to the person as I'd hate for them to be glued to the phone. I'm respectful in this regard and give people time. (Something that I've learnt) However, it's certain things that worry me. They do certain things and have had a history of doing it and also admitted to running ""Social experiments on people"". 

&#x200B;

I've never met anyone who is like it. It more than upsets me it rips me apart. I love everyone that I know and I don't like to push people away but I feel that the person is doing it purposefully."

Anxiety is the reason that I stopped playing League of Legends people can be really toxic and can be really unforgiving. I'd feel really bad If I set back the team. That game would throw me into a massive spiral. I realised it was best if I didn't play as the anxiety really wasn't worth it for me.

&#x200B;

Thing that helped me is just remembering that it's a game that it's supposed to be fun! I found that when I was playing with the right people made a massive difference. Really genuine people understand and it's a game at the end of the day it's supposed to be fun!"

For 5 years I left my house at 7am without fail. If I didn't leave at 7am I'd have a full blown anxiety attack.
