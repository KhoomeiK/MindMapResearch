BPD,exfwnnh,t3_csjt4t,1566250073.0,DAE find cbd helpful for their symptoms? I used a 600 mg tincture for a short time but I'm not sure if it actually helped or was just a placebo effect.
Schizotypal,ewkgs7i,t3_copfb3,1565483996.0,I haven't had this since I was in elementary school but I totally relate and honestly sort of forgot about it. For me it was only one or two songs that would alternate but they would be on repeat for what felt like ages. It was insanely hard to focus on much when there was literal music playing in my mind.
Schizoid,etxaruz,t3_cdxne2,1563295297.0,"I relate to the poor posture thing so bad it hurts. I've had that issue ever since I was a kid. Like fuck, I just want to be able to walk without my posture being questioned."
Schizotypal,etvmzb1,t3_cdoorl,1563239584.0,I'm not really sure how to respond to this other than with the fact that I get it. There is so much I relate to it's awful and I'm sorry you have to deal with this shit. I'm undiagnosed but suspect all three of those. Pm me if you ever wanna chat about anything. <3
BPD,etsthn4,t3_cdankp,1563155092.0,Congrats! I'm so happy for you. You definitely deserve to celebrate :)
TameImpala,etbqp6g,t1_etbqcfc,1562657289.0,Haha that's great. That's dope that you listened to Floyd as a kid. I wasn't exposed to it until I was a teen.
TameImpala,etbpyoo,t1_etbjxbb,1562656299.0,"That is super cool! I wish I could share it with mine, I'm slightly envious haha. My whole fam even hates Pink Floyd 🙄 One of them called Led Zeppelin's Going to California ""crack head music""."
TameImpala,etba5a3,t1_etaskse,1562640933.0,Haha right on
TameImpala,etba4w3,t1_etb8fgp,1562640925.0,Their loss I suppose :)
TameImpala,etb67ci,t1_etb2yvi,1562638044.0,Absolutely. It's weird. They don't want to think too deep or anything like that.
TameImpala,etb5nna,t1_etarucx,1562637647.0,"I definitely agree that it can be too much for a lot of people but damn, if they would just open their minds shit would be so much different. I love losing myself in his music, headphones are the best. 

They used to give me so much shit for being reserved and quiet (unless I had something that I really wanted to say) and now it's like ""you listen to this music and smoke weed? You're going to be a druggy burnout someday."" That's the vibe they give me so it's really hard to want to share things with them because I know how close minded they are. 

To be fair I'm not a fan of country at all but idc what people listen to,really. I just know that when they say shit about Tame or any other music with depth (imo), I think to myself about how shallow the music that appeals to most people is. Again, that's just my opinion and I could care less what others like. 

Yes! I didn't get it at first either but now it is one of my favorite albums. Mind Mischief and Beverly Laurel are absolute braingasims for me haha"
BPD,et7ms5f,t1_et7cq4u,1562533999.0,This makes a lot sense. It's crazy how some neurotypicals deal with similar issues but it's not severe enough to warrant a diagnosis. Thank you for your response.
vandwellers,ern7vxh,t1_ern7l68,1561046622.0,"I will definitely do that, thank you for that"
vandwellers,ern7igh,t1_ern7aq2,1561046378.0,✌ That's what's up. Love your spot homie

shittyfoodporn,epulmia,t1_epucp8w,1559511613.0,This post is definitely appreciated and gives a plausible backstory
BPD4BPD,epet9bf,t1_epe2g1h,1559186778.0,"You could definitely be onto something,I'm in the process of visiting a therapist that will hopefully set me up with a psychiatrist. It has gotten a little better as I've matured and gotten older but many problems are still there. 

Whenever I'm experiencing mania it feels like I'm on a sort of stimulant (I don't use them ever,just an analogy). I feel reckless,though I've gotten better at self control through self awareness. This entails reckless spending, social behavior, and me being somebody that I'm not. When I come down from the mania I'm often ashamed of myself and this usually leads to the emptiness that comes along with bpd. I find no pleasure in the daily things that I usually enjoy during this phase. Something as simple as sitting down and watching a movie or playing video games gives me zero pleasure.

 It is chronic emptiness at it's worst. The only thing that is enjoyable is sleep (usually 15 hours average). This isn't often but when it hits,it's nearly unbearable. I've tried so hard to find different hobbies but it seems to be me attempting to fill a gap in my life. Friends have definitely helped me find enjoyment in simple activites again,so it's not all negative."
BPD4BPD,epdzgmh,t1_epdwrnt,1559176772.0,"I have. Idk what to think anymore. Everyday life is so fucking confusing,especially when I experience the intense mania that comes along with bpd. It's hard to care about life most days."
BPD4BPD,epdclzv,t3_bude8e,1559164473.0,"I have always felt like something was ""off"" about myself but only found out about bpd not long ago. When I was around 7 years old I noticed that I would be attached to different people (now I know those were my FP) and I would copy or include various things they did into my life. For example,I would sit exactly how my FP sat, changing my position according to theirs. I would also use their lingo, get super into their interests,etc. Like I said,I knew everyone else most likely wasn't doing this but I had an almost nonexistent self image so that was how I coped as a child. After a few weeks or so I would drop everything I picked up from them and move on to my next FP. 

Another sign as a kid was explosive anger. I would be at lunch with my ""friends"" (manipulative,condescending scum fucks) minding my own business and I could almost feel them all gang up on me all of a sudden,it felt like an intense wave of betrayal. I would ask them to please stop and of course,they never did, so I would go absolutely mad and lose it. Eventually I got tired of feeling like a fool even though it seemed like they were going out of their way to make me feel like shit, so I became very numb and reserved. I would sit by myself or with random people,always feeling excluded. This only added to the already awful abandonment issues that I faced. 


I also dealt with depersonalization/derealization as a child. I always felt like I was an extra on a movie set that neurotypicals call life. Not like an actual movie though, I just felt like I didn't belong in this body or this society. I wished many times that I either didn't exist or that I could be an animal,a tree,etc. When somebody would speak to me it felt like they were talking to somebody else and I was just an observer. I would stare at myself in the mirror and not recognize the person I saw. 


I could talk about this for ages but those are just a few of the things I dealt with as a child (and still do). This disorder is so misunderstood and a lot of the time, those with it are victims of abuse,both mentally and physically. If anyone needs to talk or just wants acknowledgement that you're a human being and you matter,please do not hesitate to message me. ❤"
