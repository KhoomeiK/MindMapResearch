It’s definitely interesting, I remember in one of my jobs as a teenager (working as a cashier) that one lady would come in, buy a cake, almost like clock work, come to the register and proceed to whine about how bad she is for doing this.

Naturally this pissed me off because I couldn’t give a fuck, just pay and fuck off, but I decided to go along with it, I told her “yes, you are. I see you in here every week buying the same cake” this is when I learned that people’s true selves come out in emotion. She broke down, told me a little bit about how she’d divorced her husband a month ago and how she’s now in financial hardship. While this doesn’t actually mean anything, I found it interesting how easy it was to open someone up.
