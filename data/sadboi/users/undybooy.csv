BPD,fmcf8lx,t3_fucv6e,1585944526.0,"I took seroquel which is the same drug( I believe that is a generic). Anyways I took it for 6 years of my life since 14.I‚Äôve been off of it for almost 2 years and I‚Äôve been the most unstable in my entire life. Probably the worst mental health state I‚Äôve had so far. And I‚Äôm bpd as fuck as well with anxiety and depression to top it off.
It helped with my sleep and it helped with my emotions. I didn‚Äôt realize until I was off. No one can force you to take drugs you don‚Äôt want but there may be a reason they are giving it to you. Drugs aren‚Äôt permanent btw. You have all the power to stop taking them (of course do not do that yourself without intervention from professionals). If you have a harsh line to not take anti psychotics then you have you answer . Not sure what answer you‚Äôre looking for on here.
I do know that I personally wish I had the opportunity to be put on medicine again. What one doctor says another hates. It‚Äôs different perspective that unfortunately leaves the decision in your hands.
If you‚Äôre wanting more info message me. Not sure if I had helped in anyway."

You‚Äôre just a number that will be counted. Please think about yourselves y‚Äôall. The government ain‚Äôt gonna do it for you and not your friends. And definitely NOT you job.

BDSMAdvice,fl402km,t1_fl3z9k6,1584802748.0,"Just because she didn‚Äôt accept it doesn‚Äôt mean it wasn‚Äôt needed. If someone is upset during an argument and the other says sorry, even tho that person may not be able to fully take in their sorry, it still matters in that moment, that they apologize, that they tried to console even if you didn‚Äôt want it. Aftercare still matters and you should‚Äôve been a dom and given it to her or tried. 
You even said in your own damn post you should‚Äôve negotiated it better so you do feel guilt about your actions. If you‚Äôre 100% in the right why tf are you coming here for advice? Because you don‚Äôt feel like you are. Everyone so far has told you that you‚Äôre in the wrong so take the L man. You didn‚Äôt discuss enough with her before this even happened because you‚Äôre here left unsure and I can‚Äôt even imagine her.
Humans are weird, women are weirder. Just because someone doesn‚Äôt accept a kind action of aftercare doesn‚Äôt revoke your responsibility to care for her as a dom. You fail as a dom and I hope to god you don‚Äôt have sessions with anyone else. Disgusting."
BPD,fl3zeg8,t1_fl3yzf0,1584802279.0,"Get better at choosing your friends then . Sounds like high school to me. He was your ex tho? So not together. Yet here you are angry about it for years. You can be 22, 30, hell even 40 and still act like you‚Äôre in high school"

Don‚Äôt paint everyone the same color just because you experienced one single color of the BPD rainbow so to speak."

A ‚Äúbad‚Äù night for y‚Äôall just means you get paid minimum wage like me and everyone else. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt feel bad about the tripping thing. It‚Äôs so Americanized and as someone who was brought up in Portuguese family, it makes no sense. Tips are earned  and not mandatory. If servers wanna complain about tips, then go get another job. It isn‚Äôt the consumers job to supply the worker with their pay;thats your employer.

GenderCritical,fiu4pt0,t1_fis5cbq,1582735105.0,Exactly. People only give a shit about Kobe because he‚Äôafamous and profitable. But that still doesn‚Äôt make his life worth more than his own damn daughter and the others who perished. What about them? I don‚Äôt even know their names at all! All I see is a bunch of crap about Kobe and how Kobe got his wife the dress from The Notebook. WHO THE FUCK CARES??
