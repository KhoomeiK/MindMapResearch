Basically just calling up the lender and be like ""yea, Covid, it's a bitch"" And then they wouldn't have to make payments for a few months and just tack it on at the end of their mortgage...The manager/landlord at my complex didn't reduce rent at all. She actually raised it for some people, and one of the neighbors overheard her on the phone in the office bragging about how she's bringing in wads of money thanks to the pandemic. It may or may not be related to the deferred payments, there are probably other elements put in place to protect landlords that we don't know about.

People are going to end up taking out loans they shouldn't be just to try and break-even that's going to do even more damage. There will be a significant increase in welfare applicants across all 83 income-based programs, and so on.
