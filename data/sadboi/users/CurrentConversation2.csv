OCD,fgic3k7,t3_eylcy1,1580816235.0,"Ugh yeeees. or if i say something like “jesus fuck” in my head and i’m not religious and don’t really believe in god, but start to panic that someone was listening and i’ll be killed or punished."
OCD,fgiby4h,t3_ey0ind,1580816043.0,"that’s rly rough, ocd doesn’t get enough credit for tearing people apart. i hope things get better for you, here if you need to talk."
OCD,fggkxqi,t1_fgfmd9v,1580764020.0,thanks i rly appreciate that
OCD,fgfbzsw,t3_exzp5z,1580733917.0,"i didn’t rly understand this, but i’m somehow convinced that there one hair in my eyebrow that the follicle is going the wrong way and if i can find it and pull it out it will fix everything?"
OCD,fgfbvit,t3_ey1o0h,1580733796.0,"yes, i have this ocd paranoia intrusive thought type thing where i’m convinced that there is a nest of spiders somewhere in whatever building i’m in. i can’t ever stop picture then rushing out of every crevice and just filling up the room, to the point that when someone touches me i flinch because i think there’s a spider on me. i had a dream about this memory of my friends and i crossing a river by jumping in the stones in the water, but in my dream the water was spiders instead, crawling up us until we literally drowned in them. i have those kinds of dreams a lot and they rly ruin the memories by tainting them with all of my fear and intrusive thoughts."
OCD,fgfbj9t,t3_ey0ind,1580733448.0,"I haven’t lost a partner to ocd, but my mothers ocd rly ruined our relationship. ever since i was born she has episodes every few weeks where she just cleans and cleans and screams at me to start cleaning too because i made everything too messy. she was medicated for a while after my brother was born but hasn’t been since. these periods have resulted in pretty bad trust issues and we honestly hardly talk anymore even tho we still live in the same house. what’s your story?"
OCD,fgfb8dx,t3_ey5ybx,1580733137.0,"it’s obviously best to go to a professional for a diagnoses, but i can definitely relate to intrusive thoughts about stepping into traffic or jumping off of trains. here if you need to talk, good luck"
OCD,fgd721m,t3_exuukf,1580679585.0,"Yes! i do this a lot but more with people i don’t know... like someone at a supermarket whose name tag says “kate” or smth i spend some long just thinking about all the times they’ve been called kate, where they went to school, what their family is like, their best and worst experience, the thing their most afraid of... there r so many angles of a person that we don’t get to see and it’s hard not to think about that all the time."
mentalillness,fgcxq5f,t3_exccvf,1580677145.0,"sure, i’m so glad i could help! feel free to message me whenever."
mentalillness,fgaguh6,t3_exccvf,1580651045.0,"hey, i’m all too farmiliar with these rough patches and ik it feels like it’s never going to end, but i promise you it gets easier. don’t expect any miracles or anything, i don’t think that level of hopelessness ever truly leaves us alone. but you’ll get stronger. just take it day by day, anxiety is crippling, i understand that. just try. if you can barely make it out of your house, that’s still an achievement because you tried. haven’t failed till u stop trying. all the best, here if u need to talk."
mentalillness,fgafj81,t3_exf0xn,1580650662.0,"hey, it seems possible you may be suffering from harm ocd, might be worth looking into. i suffer from it too, here if you need to chat."
mentalillness,fgaf8a6,t3_exj5vj,1580650545.0,"hey, i’m 15 too and i totally understand where you’re coming from. any problem i have is teenage drama or hormones or MY PHONE. YES MY PHONE IS THE CAUSE OF MY OCD WHY DIDNT WE THING OF THIS BEFORE!? it’s stressful and confusing to not being able to settle on who you want to be, but it’s also okay to change day to day. people don’t have to be the same all the time. and looking at literally any happy person makes me so mad as well, like why is it so easy for them? also people are generally around 30% more attractive than they think, just so you know. I get it. here if u wanna talk."
mentalillness,fgadpo8,t3_exmli6,1580650079.0,"honestly it took me so long to acknowledge that anything was wrong because i was in denial and trying to beat my brain into submission. my ocd was so bad that i was constantly paranoid and shaking and jumping and couldn’t sleep, all the while trying to convince myself that i was fine and not crazy. i started beating my head against walls when it got to loud in my head and even then i would say “ i’m just fixing it it’s fine, nothings wrong.” then my mother (who is a doctor) picked up on one of what i consider to be one of my most harmless and benign compulsions and said that it was pretty strange, ocd-ish type behaviour and that i needed to get a handle on it or see a psychologist. i almost laughed because she had no idea how much worse the rest of it is. i looked at all the things i do with the mindset that the least distressing one was still rly bad, and realised that i needed help. no problem is too small to seek help! also ik that eating disorders r super tricky, i hope you’re doing okay now:)"
OCD,fg51uiv,t3_ewru2f,1580516225.0,"so great that you’re reaching out and seeking help, you should be rly proud of that. psychiatrists are the best people for things like ocd, depression and bipolar (if you think that might be a problem for you), but i get that it’s tricky if they’re two hours away. seeing a gp is probably a good place to start, but if things don’t get better, maybe consider online counselling?
good luck."
OCD,fg51jd9,t3_ewvwj9,1580516009.0,"honestly no remotely healthy coping mechanisms to speak of, but i do understand. playing out the implications of literally ever thing you do like ordering food a a restaurant is fucking exhausting. i hope things get better for u tho, here if u need to talk."
OCD,fg51d5z,t3_eww5p7,1580515890.0,"i’m so sorry you’re going through that, and i do understand. it’s just kills to things about how much THINGS are in the world, all i want it a perfectly clean, empty, plain white room with nothing in it, sad that that’s literally my happy place. it’s terrible that you’re parents aren’t on your side here, does your school have a therapist you can talk to? idk where you are but there are lots of initiatives in australia that offer free therapy, especially for young adults, might be worth doing some research. hang in there, i really hope things get better for you. here if you need to talk."
OCD,fg50jz4,t3_ewusmm,1580515337.0,"yes, i get this weird pressure headache at the back of my head then have this intrusive thought of stabbing a pencil into the back of my neck to relieve it. also hyperventilate and feel sick to my stomach."
OCD,fg50b3v,t3_ewuce8,1580515175.0,"so relate to this, i have this rly weird fear of throwing up for some reason so anyone that has been or is feeling sick in the stomach i literally cannot be within 6 feet of, and have to wash my body if i get closer than that. my brother got sick in vietnam and i kept hyperventilating and almost passing out every time i thought about it."
OCD,fg5026x,t3_ewucvc,1580515009.0,"yes, literally worrying about when it will come back instead of enjoying having a break from it. this is so weird and i realise that, but does anyone else worry that their ocd won’t come back? like i view it as a part of me as unhealthy as that probably is, and don’t want to know what my life would be without it."
OCD,fg3df4z,t3_ewkhvj,1580478599.0,YES waves and then i think i’m just being ocd by thinking i have ocd? so glad other people understand this.
OCD,fg3d1hv,t3_ewo2wn,1580478302.0,"unfortunately don’t have any tips, but i definitely understand what you’re going thru. having so many obsessions and telling myself constantly that they’re not real and that what i’m doing is crazy makes you really question everything you do and check that you got it right in your head. it’s hard to live with, exhausting sometimes. here if you need to chat."
confessions,fg30za0,t3_ewiber,1580465206.0,Good on you. Too many people feel guilty for hating those society obliviously dictates they should love
OCD,fft7ftp,t1_ffrpl4b,1580210890.0,Every time somebody replays one of my snaps i start panicking and think that i accidentally sent a nude or smth even if i know i was dressed? so i have to check with everyone to make sure the photo was normal.
OCD,fft6wst,t3_ev0tz6,1580210195.0,"yes, all the time. i do something so harmless like stack a plate incorrectly then my head tells me i’m a “fucking psycho”, i don’t get it. here if u need to chat."
OCD,ffq7c2n,t3_eumlxs,1580124333.0,"ik, i feel like it annoys everyone."
OCD,ffq6p84,t3_eujbcx,1580123423.0,"I’m in a similar position to you, experiencing a lot of ocd-ish things since i was a kid without ever being diagnosed. it’s honestly so good to know someone else does the car thing, when i’m just sitting in a car i have to clench my toes on the foot on the side of any large tree, car or electricity pole i pass. like i said,  i understand and i’m here if u need to talk."
OCD,ffq6gkz,t3_eujiy1,1580123061.0,"idk if i’m completely wrong here, but are these thoughts that are too horrible to speak of about harming yourself or other people? I get these, its called harm ocd, where you get these incredible violent and graphic thoughts and ideas of harming people and animals. I still grapple with the idea that im a murderer and a monster and a psychopath even tho iv never hurt anyone. Here to talk if you can relate, or just need to vent."
OCD,ffq60v3,t3_euk6up,1580122401.0,"Honestly relate to this so much. I zone out all the time, startle back to reality and get confused about whether i’m dreaming or if things i think about have happened or not. I feel so unstable and like i should srly be admitted, and the only thing that helps is banging my head against a hard surface three times. My mind  isn’t clear and i scare myself."
OCD,ff4mp0x,t3_er2ieb,1579567338.0,here if u need to talk.
OCD,ff2x0nr,t3_er2ieb,1579527292.0,"hey i really understand this, i love my dogs so much but sometimes i just want to kick them or strangle them for no reason even though i’m not a violent person and then i feel so guilty for it and think i must be really fucked up."

lonely,ff1znfi,t3_er5l6v,1579489930.0,"I really get what you’re saying. Every day seems so repetitive and if it never amounts to anything then what’s the point of any of it? I don’t really have any advice, but know you’re not the only one feeling this."
lonely,fey5uuk,t3_eqvrrw,1579441231.0,"I have this issue with most of my friends as well, and the rest of the time I feel like my problems are a burden to them even though I know they would listen. My mother is chaotic and unpredictable and I'm not close to my family, and therapy isn't an option so I think I know how you feel. It's hard to feel that alone, just know that you're not the only one feeling it."
lonely,fey46rr,t3_eqtgwq,1579440625.0,"So understand this, you start to feel like you're an actor playing out your life because you're pretending so hard to other people."

sad,fey12o6,t3_eqtfn0,1579439390.0,Can anyone relate to this being about parents not relationships?
depression,fexzh42,t3_enrs4c,1579438771.0,"This is honestly so relatable. Any brief moment that I'm actually doing okay just gets me into that headspace of ""you are honestly so rediculous for thinking that you have real problems"" or ""you're like every typical dramatic teenager, just doing it for attention."" Since no one is dying and nothing tragic is happening to me, the only conclusion I can draw is that I'm doing this to myself on purpose for pity from other people. I know that's not true but I can't even trust myself anymore."
