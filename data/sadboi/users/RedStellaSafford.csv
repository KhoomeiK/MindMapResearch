And at the same time, while fewer women overall are having children, the increase in female childlessness is less than male childlessness. 

Why? Well, it's easy: There are more men having children by multiple mothers.

You know how the Japanese have terms for the phenomena they're experiencing in courtship and sexuality – terms like hikikomori, herbivore men, parasite singles, etc.?
