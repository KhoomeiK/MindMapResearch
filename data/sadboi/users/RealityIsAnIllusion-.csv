1) You ask him to wake you if you fall asleep. You fall asleep. He doesn’t wake you. 

2) Your phone dies and won’t turn on. Instead of saying “I’M SORRY for not waking you” or just going “oh well” and moving on (because you know, MISTAKES HAPPEN), he instead gets furious at you and blames you for not plugging it in, refusing to take fault for not waking you like you asked. 

3) When you stand your ground, he cusses at you and leaves, then comes back later acting “withdrawn” in an attempt to gaslight you into thinking you’re at fault over everything. 

4) When that doesn’t seem to work, he says he will get you a new phone. You say ok thank you. This is not what he was expecting (I assume he wanted you to feel bad that he had to buy you a new phone) so he brings your DEAD MOTHER into the picture and how you’ll never hear her voice again in an attempt to get a rise out of you. 

5) You ask him why he acts so cruelly and he tells you that you deserve it and everyone will understand why. 

Guess what buddy, you’re an asshole of the highest level. You’re not fooling any of us. 

OP, this is narcissism and emotional abuse and you don’t “deserve” any of the shit he did. There is no reason to go this off the handle and act that childish over a stupid phone, no matter WHO is at fault. Mistakes happen. At this point I would seriously start thinking about your children and their future too, because if he starts doing this shit to them later down the road (he will), it could really mess them up.

Still killed the boss in like 30 seconds and no one died, but afterwards I was bombarded with “WTF TANK BAD TANK TRASH TANK KYS” etc etc lol.

relationship_advice,fjp21cb,t3_fef04y,1583539930.0,">I am not looking for a divorce. I take my marriage very seriously. **I feel I've sacrificed a shit ton to ensure this marriage stays successful**. Divorce is not something I entertain. That's why, when push comes to shove, **I know I'll be the one to give up my opportunity.** For the sake of keeping my family together. **That's how it's always gone.** I know that that's where this is headed.

I hate to be one of those people who say that maybe you should entertain divorce...but maybe you should entertain divorce. I have done nothing most of my life except sacrifice it for others and let me tell you now... it's *not* the way to go. You even said yourself how upsetting it is that your husband is choosing his family over his wife and children. And you *should* be upset, because that's pretty fucked up. Also real freaking shit of him to not even attempt to try and make a plan or compromise with you over something this important to you. What has HE sacrificed for YOU? IMO it looks like this guy knows/feels that you will fold eventually, which is why he's immediately shutting you down every time you try and talk about it. He's just waiting it out. That's not a two-way loving, respectful relationship and you don't have to be OK with it or sacrifice alone for it.

Like others have said here, I would take the job. I would love to see an update on this in the future, where you put your foot down and told him you're going, with or without him. Maybe then he would change his tune when he realized you weren't going to be pushed around this time.

Either way, I really hope for the best for you, and I hope you manage to stand your ground some. At the very least, I would not stop until he was respectful enough to have a real conversation about this, because it's important to you and if he truly cared about you, he would have the decency to at least do that.

You deserve happiness too."

I really don't understand why some are saying otherwise.

According to OP's post, this guy practically committed wage theft, then tried to gaslight OP by saying they had a 'disrespectful tone' instead of just giving an explanation when OP asked for one. As a boss or a manager, it is your job to give proper information in situations like this. Why is it acceptable for this guy to refuse to do his job, but not OP? Is it because he makes more money? Is it because he's higher on the totem pole? They both put their pants on the same way every morning, and they ***both*** should be held responsible for their specific job requirements, nevertheless.

IMO, the boss got a well-deserved taste of their own medicine, and now, OP shouldn't be worrying about whether or not they will lose their job over it - they should be asking themselves if they want to continue putting up with this unprofessional, disrespectful environment. More and more these days I see people sacrifice their self-respect by continuously sucking up to some dick head, just to keep a job that they could have another of tomorrow. That mentality is a big reason why disrespect like this is an ongoing problem in many work places. If more people didn't put up with it, more companies would have to do some serious re-evaluating. 

PS: Boss is definitely trying to micromanage you as well. If he had time to send you thirteen texts, on your day off, over a schedule that doesn't change for you, he had time to give you an explanation, and he clearly knows this."

You are 100% right. They’ve completely stepped over the line. What the fuck is wrong with people? You don’t say or do shit like that to ANYONE let alone your damn kid. 

These people are some severely fucked up narcissists. Like others have said: no wonder they hate you, they can’t abuse the shit out you and beat you down emotionally like they’ve easily been able to do to their son since day 1. 

I’m hopeful that you and your husband will mutually agree to kick them to the curb permanently, this way maybe your husband can start to see how things truly should and can be in a loving home, and your kid won’t end up getting caught in anything."

AskAstrologers,fdgckn2,t1_fdfb1m7,1578390193.0,"Thank you too. I try so hard to stay true to myself, and to live my life as much as I can in the creative and passionate way you describe, but sometimes I still find myself getting lost due to the pressuring demands of our conformed society and messed up economy. It’s nice to get that reminder from time to time that I’m still right on track.

I was in a situation similar to yours once, except when I woke up my portion of the food was still there. Your friends know they’re in the wrong and they don’t care. Just trying to sucker you. They suck."
Seaofthieves,fddbgug,t3_ekk27z,1578304047.0,This happened to me the other night. Was my first day back from like an 8 month break. Want the kind soul who left the crate to know that the first thing I did was use like 20 fire bombs on my boat since they were new to me...for science of course. Worth it.

I know I’m late to the party and you’ll probably never see this, but truly you did the right thing. I saw your edits where you said that some people called you TA, and honestly, I have no idea why they would. I see so many people come here and speak about lies that have completely fucked up their life, when if they had just been given the truth in the beginning, things wouldn’t have been anywhere near as bad. You’re a great dad and you’re 100% doing it right. Your son will appreciate it so much more than you know as he gets older."
