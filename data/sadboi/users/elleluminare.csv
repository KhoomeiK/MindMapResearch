BPD,fbs5ws8,t1_fbs57ra,1577050696.0,"yeah I have aaaaaaaaaallllllllllll the books lol that was the first thing I did when I was diagnosed. Every time I see a new therapist they're always shook that I know so much about it all already, I think that might be part of the reason why my last therapist wanted to take a break, because she couldn't help me with anything cuz I already knew all the stuff. Not sure tho, kinda salty about it lol but ya I have more workbooks than any one person should have."
BPD,fbkf2bt,t3_edji7x,1576949320.0,It's never too late and you should take as much time as you feel you need to accomplish whatever you want to accomplish. I've struggled with this for a long time and I've always felt like everything is just easier for other people who don't have BPD and it took me 5 years of therapy to finally understand that it's okay to take your time. People are judgmental and will always criticize others for not reaching the same milestones at the same time as them and that judgment rubs off on you and these strong negative feelings will impact progress in your life. It's counterproductive to judge yourself for taking more time than neurotypicals.
BPD,f0wx9vt,t3_d6ssry,1569015871.0,"People don't realize that this is something a lot of us carry every day. My mother was telling me that ""life is what you make it and you choose to be happy"" and this just validates how much she doesnt understand bpd or suicidal ideation. It's not that I am ungrateful for the things that I do have, it's that my brain doesnt respond to things in a ""normal"" way. This is not a choice and it's not my fault. Of course I want to be happy, as does literally everyone. I never thought I'd make it past 16 but at 18 I sought out help and I like to think im getting better at coping; however, I'm not necisarily in a better place now at 25 than I was before treatment. Every day my mind is flooded with suicidal thoughts. It's just something that I know I'm going to carry with me until the day I die. My last breath will be a sigh of relief."
BPD,f0wtsr3,t3_d6esmt,1569013906.0,"my ""crazy"" me is never out when im in therapy and my therapist kicked me out because she thinks im doing well but im 25 unemployed ed, self harm, anxiety &  BPD the whole 9 yards man and  i cant maintain a job or friends and i barely leave my bedroom like lol ok ? I guess im not bad enough for treatment anymore????? \*rolls eyes forever\* the mental health system is horrendous"
BPD,eztbrrq,t3_d22z6e,1568126530.0,"This post makes me happy. I was diagnosed with BPD many many years ago and I have always had it in my head, whether it be with a negative connotation or positive, that no one is coming to save me. At the end of the day, you do have to be the one to love yourself or even attempt to be the person you've always been hoping for. it's been over a year of no SH or attempts and as someone who is about a decade into treatment, I know that it doesn't get better, you just get better at coping and understanding your own thinking/feeling processes. Every day I feel like I shouldn't be here; however, every day I remind myself that I AM here anyway so I might as well see how it plays out. I'm not sure if that's a good strategy, but I'm still here so I'll take it lol I'm so proud of you for understanding that you have to be there for yourself the way you want your fp or family members to. It's okay to be sort of alone in all this, I know I am and it's hard, really fucking hard, but I know now I am smarter, kinder and more understanding of a person because of it all. Stay strong guys, take it one step at a time. You can do this."
