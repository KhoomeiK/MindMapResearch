funny,f7g1s3x,t1_f7fzuvt,1573692336.0,If you look up 'car rug' or similar on Amazon it should come up. I got one for my kid a little while ago.
Frugal,f0xgt98,t3_d6z4cq,1569032192.0,You can shop at both Sam's and Costco without a membership if you get a gift card. I think Sam's has a slight upcharge but I doubt it's anything compared to Instacart fees. And you can usually find gift cards being sold online for a little under retail value.
namenerds,ezl40gi,t1_ezjv2pa,1567971583.0,"I really like Slyvia Renae Shields. But I'm a big fan of unique/less common first names paired with a more traditional middle name, to sort of make the first name stand out a bit without it sounding like too much is going on."
AmItheAsshole,exl2z87,t1_exky3oy,1566404846.0,"DSW has some really nice shoes in larger sizes. Above a certain size they only sell them online but it's a nice selection, definitely on the more expensive side though. I wear a size women's 13. It's a pain but I get most of my shoes from there. I have seen alot of online shops that go up to an 11 though."
ExpectationVsReality,ex3crbi,t1_ex30y4b,1565983544.0,"That's definitely a thing but it depends on alot. Dyes like manic panic and most ""temporary"" dyes are semi permanent. Manic panic is one of the more ""temporary"" semi permanent dyes but it's still very common for your base hair color to change slightly and hold onto a little bit of the color for awhile. Depending on the color you choose, the brand and your hair color/type, they can last a long time. Reds and pinks are known for not fading completely out more often. Also if you've ever bleached or processed your hair they are more likely to last longer. They're also ways to try to strip the color out but aren't always completely effective. I wouldn't ever go into semi-permanent dye with the expectation that it will 100% always completely fade out in a couple months and look like it did in the beginning.

If you do dye your hair it's important to know if you're getting semi permanent or Demi permanent dye. Demi permanent dyes will last considerably longer.

Colored hair wax or chalk is cool to try out colors and it stays until you wash your hair."
Aliexpress,ewdyb1m,t1_ewabaie,1565310276.0,"I was planning on just waiting to mark not received. I'm not worried about getting my money back. Just confused as to why they would do that. Since it's not tracked wouldn't they be in the same situation if they just didn't sent anything. Plus the other person's shipping address on the other said, was strange to me."

AskRedditAfterDark,etpffvl,t1_etpaidn,1563054002.0,"It's extremely rare for it not to resolve itself in adolescents. It's also pretty easily treated in most cases. Only a extremely small percentage of cases would require circumcision. So circumcision would be more painful, more expensive and the healing process would be longer than any other treatment used to treat it."

StopSelfHarm,etkec1b,t3_cbmkrf,1562895794.0,I self harmed for 6 years I think. Stopped a few years ago. I no longer have any urges to cut or self harm for the most part. However I wasn't actively trying to quit self harming. I just slowly started losing that desire to do it and one day I just stopped. So having an urge to selfharm has only happened a couple times the first year or so and they were pretty easily ignorable for me. Everyone has different experiences.

It was a boy, she named him Dean."

StopSelfHarm,ermbmym,t3_c2phcw,1561014155.0,I reported them when the showed up on my feed. I haven't self harmed in over 2 years and that was still upsetting and triggering. It popping up on my feed without warning honestly threw a wrench in my day. I couldn't imagine what seeing those would have made me feel a couple months into recovery. I wished they would have at the very least added a NSFW filter and a TW.
AmItheAsshole,eptn40e,t1_ept7l4w,1559493607.0,"Don't know about other babies, but at 2 months old my kid only slept while I was holding/ rocking him. It wasn't like I could lay him down and take some me time. Having a newborn isnt even comparable to most full time jobs imo. I would get a max of 5 hours of sleep a day. Typically less than that. You don't get weekends off, or nights. I would of worked a 9-5 anyday of the week over caring for a newborn full time, without help."
