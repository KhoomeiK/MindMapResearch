More than Krista did, in my opinion. Vera did more in one night than Krista in so many sessions. Just like psychedelics :D 

Vera was a real shaman!

Too bad he was also a crackhead psycho killer :-/"

SuicideWatch,feb13uk,t3_eo9o49,1578954397.0,"Hey. Please don't do anything in that state of mind! When we are like that we cannot evaluate, judge,weigh, calculate and value anything right! 
I have tried to look up your Reddit profile and saw some of your posts in other subreddits.. I can see you're really going through some very hard times.. and I am really sorry.

I would rather say that in this life, we cannot escape what we fear.. we can only delay it's happening. 
So my best advice is to just face your fears right away! 
Things cannot go worse than this.. you have to believe that! Believe that you need to get better, so please accept any help you're receiving!!

You are lucky to can go to a hospital or any other cure house.. it doesn't matter what it is, as long as you are trying to get help. 

You are the master of yourself! So no any place will ever be really able to put you down or to change your core.. if you keep to be true to yourself.

Accept change also! Change is natural. These are times of changing more than ever! We all are going through this process. Don't give up! 

We are evolving I think. I feel. So, no matter how weird, this is somehow natural! 
Don't give up the fight, because you are needed into this big change! Work with it as much as you can, do not give up..!!

Life will also reward you! You have the control... The rest will do the universe. Work and collaborate with it. 

I'm also struggling with different stuff... Its not easy, but we can all help each other. 

Big hug from Romania, Europe."

Krista the most .. uh mama, she's hot!"
MrRobot,f7c1wts,t3_dv33jk,1573582601.0,"The scene Leon passed the oxy to Elliot under the table was spectacular, it made me crack in laughter. Lol"
MrRobot,f7c119w,t1_f7bar5i,1573582047.0,"After what he did, the way he did it, an immediate excuse wouldn't do anything else than bad results. The only thing can do something is time and small other actions that could talk to Olivia's heart.It's  just that Elliot has too much on his head right now.

I felt so sad for how things ended between them... She is so damn beautiful and seems the best thing could happen to Elliot in this point of his life.

But life is hard and pushes you to cross fucking lines..!"
MrRobot,f7bi9uv,t1_f7b4fnk,1573569609.0,You're right. But then she went straight in the bathroom to cut her veins........
MrRobot,f7bi4n2,t1_f7b8zsi,1573569500.0,That scene that Leon passes the stuff to Elliot under the table cracked me up in laughter !! So good :D !
