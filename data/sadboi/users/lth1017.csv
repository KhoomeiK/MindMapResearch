I actually once had a women with her whole family on Easter come In late with her infant after the rest of the 8 top had already ordered drinks. She was clearly pissed at her husband as I came up to grab her Drink order. she‚Äôs telling me what kind of Chardonnay she wants while literally, I shit you not, unbuttoning her shirt and flopped her breast out to breast feed her child which is fine and all (all the while making dead ass eye contact with me, and believe me I have NEVER held better eye contact in my life) As soon as she was done ordering her husband immediately ordered another drink. I‚Äôm all for breast feeding in public as it‚Äôs natural but she clearly did it out of malice towards her husband.
