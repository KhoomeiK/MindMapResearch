Also bringing up an era that existed hundreds of years ago has no weight in current time. Tribal differences were a territorial factor mixed with xenophobia. A majority did not believe they were better, they only became aggressive once infringed on their believed territorial rights. 

Least racially tolerant yet the author of that paper quotes, “Third, the survey question is a way of judging racial tolerance but, like many social science metrics, is indirect and imperfect.” He also gives a couple other reasons like, the fact that it is not Indians that are racially intolerant, it’s the people living in India. There are 2000 different ethnic groups in India. But nice try! 

You’re enforcing a definition onto me so are you racist? I hate that fucking point. It’s ridiculous. 

Although you are right that whites people aren’t powerful everywhere, they do have extreme sway on all governments of the world. Take America’s military power as an example. They’ve proven themselves very, selective; when destroying evil organizations around the world. Thanks for citing one PHILISOPHICAL book to back all your shit up. 

Good job believing NBC BBC and fucking RebelNews discussing how POTENTIALLY in ONE city, they’re being removed due to racism. You believe everything you read don’t you. Cite a fact or two rather than the hypothesis of some bullshit news article. Literally the only “fact” check any of those hold, is of a biased Facebook video you fucking imbecile. You’ve proved nothing. 

Lately racism is a word based on perspective,(nowadays) I will say that in North America, that has the most weight. Xenophobia is not racism, I’ll say it again. Have an awful day sir!"
