teenagers,fmo642d,t3_fwgiz6,1586246771.0,"My best explanation-

Basically, say you have three characters. Two are bi and one is pan. The pan character doesn’t care what gender you are, they can still feel attracted to you. Then bi character 1 says they are attracted to both men and women, but they don’t feel attracted to trans and non-binary. Bi character 2 feels attracted to only men and women, yet they don’t care if you are trans or not, they don’t feel attracted to non-binary.

I hope this helps. People can also only be attracted to non-binary and a binary gender. It’s really just a matter of preference though. I’m pan, so I can’t speak for everyone in the bi community."
