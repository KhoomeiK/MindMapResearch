ADHD,fqlqju7,t3_gjex1b,1589464148.0,"That particular conversation sounds like they just don't know how to be inclusive of other people, and it's pretty rude. I have the same dynamic with a group of friends where I've only known them for a couple of years, and they've all known each other for almost a decade, but they're great with being inclusive and when they share memories or inside jokes, they always explain it to me and let me in on the context. It's a sign of maturity.

I do also get overstimulated in good conversations too, but its a lot more bearable when I'm enjoying myself. I have understanding friends and family, so they know it's not personal when I say I need a break from talking, and most of my close friends have adhd or are neurodiverse in some way, so we usually end up having long conversations for a bit and then chill out on our phones in silence."

Of course I'm more considerate of other people as an adult, and I actually let the other person speak now lol, but if someone has an issue with me being passionate about something and talking about it in depth just because they're not interested, I just don't see it as my problem anymore.

I recently had that happen in a zoom meet up with some buddies and was talking about animal crossing. Other people were joining in on the conversation too (even friends who don't have it yet), but one of my mates got pissy and said ""can we have a conversation that everyone's apart of?""
It's annoying because she's allowed to talk about her hobbies that I'm not particularly interested in, but I still participate because I like to learn more about my friends' passions.

Oh well, I got no shame for my animal crossing obsession! And you shouldn't be ashamed about being super passionate and fixated on something either!"

A really dangerous misconception about therapy is that you have to be really traumatised and dysfunctional to need it. That is simply not true. That's like saying you need to wait until you're almost septic to get an infection treated. Or that you actually have to be ill to go in for a medical check up. Prevention and early intervention is **always** better than waiting til the problem is severe.

My personal experience with mental health sounds similar to your daughter's except I didn't get help until I was 19. I seemed high functioning to others, and I was constantly told what I was feeling was normal, but I was struggling so much. Then my mental health just spiraled out of control on it's own and I ended up getting diagnosed with adhd and bipolar, among other things.

I don't go to therapy nearly as much as I used to, but that's because I personally feel I'm in a very good place and I feel healthy, but I still have occasional appointments to check in and offload to a professional.

Therapy and medication has literally saved my life. Don't risk that, and don't risk your relationship with your daughter.

I feel that a lot of people miss being manic either to compensate for the depressive episodes or because it's like an addiction. I stopped missing it because I had healthy things to replace my mania addiction and boredom.

Idk that's just from my experience and observations, so other people might have other insights."

AskReddit,et642g3,t1_et5r4x1,1562503190.0,"That just baffles me. As someone who is on multiple medications with multiple doses daily, I've always been vigilant on memorizing and researching the medications that I'm on. I've always been able to tell my doctors what medications and dosages I'm on off the top of my head, I thought was normal."

BreakUps,es8rcnn,t3_c616hz,1561710542.0,"I didn't, but that was for multiple reasons. Not on Facebook because we volunteer in the same group, and the group uses it to communicate. Not on Snapchat because I only really used it with her, so I just left it. And then not on Instagram because it just didn't feel right or necessary. I was sick of seeing her username pop up in my notifications on IG though, so I just turned then off completely and I also don't look at her stories anymore, because I realised that was making it harder to move on.

I generally started to limit my time on social media post-breakup because it was making my depression worse and was making me waste more time, instead of working on my life like I wanted to."
BreakUps,es8r0v9,t3_c5yeg2,1561710042.0,"I'm really feeling that today. 2 steps forward and 3 steps back. We can and will get through this, even if we don't always feel like it... and just because the other shit you've gone through doesn't compare, doesn't mean you won't also conquer this!"
BreakUps,es8quwq,t3_c5s1b5,1561709794.0,"Oof, some of these points really resonated with me. I really hope at least one thing I said to my ex sinks in one day, because she wasn't a bad person, she'd just been through some shit and hadn't dealt with it yet."
BreakUps,es8qjvp,t1_es40unu,1561709338.0,Sorry to hear about that shittiness. Definitely focus on those 2 good friends (and pets if you have any!) My buddies have been the main reason why I'm even functioning at the moment.

Remedy it with some angry breakup songs in your spare time, if that's your thing. That's what I've been doing to combat shitty love songs when I've had to listen to the radio"
BreakUps,es8m41s,t3_c6fbh2,1561703268.0,"I feel that. Even though I have a crap ton of hobbies, I still find myself with more time than what I know what to do with. Funny thing is that I struggled to keep up when in the relationship, now I just can't do enough."
getting_over_it,eruh4ja,t3_c3so4i,1561279495.0,"I personally find talking about my issues when I'm trying to move past them incredibly unhelpful, and it can actually make me upset all over again. Sometimes it helps, like when I feel overwhelmed and alone. I've always been this way for some reason, don't know why.

I still express my feelings through my art and music though and that makes me feel better and helps me work through things. Maybe talking just isn't your thing specifically and there's other methods that work better for you."
productivity,erpa5wx,t3_c1wvwf,1561107518.0,Personally I find sitting on my couch with my laptop helps me get into work mode better. That's probably because my brain's associated my desk and desktop with gaming and hobbies though.
BreakUps,ere8f9n,t3_c1fvt2,1560777085.0,"6 weeks ago my ex girlfriend broke up with me and I also lost my job (redundancy, so at least I can still get a good reference lol). It really does get better, but I've hit a bit of a rough patch and really needed to read this. I feel really understood, so thank you for this :)"
bipolar,ercqof5,t3_c1cmva,1560719337.0,"That makes total sense to me. I don't get this with mania, but I get loads of fatigue and brain fog and all the other physical symptoms when I'm getting depressed again. Unless it's very severe, it usually takes a while to clue onto needing antidepressants because I just chalk it up to not sleeping well or getting sick."
bipolar,ercq0qc,t3_c19g0n,1560718832.0,"I've never fully lost the ability to speak, but when the depression gets so severe to impact my speech it makes talking feel like a tremendous effort. I tend to sound drunk when super depressed."
ADHD,erbaspj,t1_er7sfsb,1560669593.0,"Agreed! All of my diagnoses started as self-diagnosing, but I always had the intention of getting professional care as well. So far I've been accurate every time, and treatment has worked out just fine."
AskReddit,eq7vzgq,t1_eq6zk5w,1559854191.0,"Oh my god, I relate with this so much. When my ex had a few car problems and had to take it to the mechanic (multiple times in the span of a few months) it was such a foreign concept to me. Growing up my mum rarely could afford to get her car serviced and even ended up having to get the engine replaced recentlyish because of how neglected it was."
