 My supervisor ended up going around asking people if they have internet at home, so clearly they are thinking about work from home options but nothing has been made official yet."
talesfromcallcenters,fknyuzl,t3_fjmisz,1584376731.0,"In my center if you’ve been in contact with some who tested positive they just said to contact your supervisor, so I don’t know what they’ll do. The only time you are not allowed to come in is if you have tested positive, and you need to send them the official paperwork saying so. They stated to apply for SDI at that point. Which takes a little while so you’d go without pay for a bit."

askwomenadvice,evzd9yg,t1_evzb164,1564954772.0,"When you have a job where you see someone almost every day for 8+ hours, you do everything you can to make those relationships as not awkward or damaged as possible. This is especially true if that person could end up in a leadership role. Tbh I think the only real solution is to just tell her you’re busy, she’ll eventually get the idea instead of you just saying flat out “no, I don’t want to hang out with you.” That creates drama in the office and I know that I couldn’t bring myself to damage a work relationship like that, unless I knew the person was going to be let go."

exmormon,eqho1t0,t3_byhf6m,1560065486.0,"My reasons for leaving the church were very very different than my reasons for deciding to not go back. I had a very unique experience with leaving and could probably spend hours telling my story. But here are my reasons for staying out:

1) Joseph Smith and the early leaders of the church. Their actions (polygamy, ordering their followers to murder sinners, etc) state a lot about how TSCC started out and was based upon. 

2) All the micromanaging rules. 

3) Sheltering children to the point where they are socially alienated in the real world. I won’t raise my children like that, and it still affects me as a young adult.

4) I can’t afford to pay tithing even if I wanted to. 

5) The guilt, shaming, and pity from members when you aren’t following the standard which has been set for you. 

As a recovered addict, I know to this day that a lot of my addiction was based in trying to remove the feeling of guilt brought on by being raised in the church and being looked down upon by my family for not adhering to the standards I was told I needed to adhere by."
