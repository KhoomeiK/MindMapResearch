depression,fpr52nz,t1_fpr4qoq,1588842678.0,"Perhaps people with depression and anxiety just aren't as keen at reaching out and making positive connections. Many people's traumas revolve around a sense of abandonment from those they trusted or looked to for support. People may come off as cold because they're scared of the prospect of being abandoned once again. I don't mean to sound like an armchair psychologist but I think people who have been hurt before are just generally slower to really open up; and that reluctance throws people off, it's a self fulfilling cycle."

depression,fpr3342,t3_gf291f,1588840643.0,"In terms of reddit, it really depends on the sub what kind of people you'll come across.

People who've experienced true sadness do not wish to inflict more pain upon others unjustly."
depression,fpr2vyf,t3_gf2a2d,1588840445.0,"I've coped with depression by finding humor in it for so long that I don't know how to tell someone seriously that I have really considered suicide. The thought of my own death doesn't scare me at all but I still have a sense of preservation in terms of injury. 

I don't self harm and have never considered it but if you handed me a loaded gun, I might just use it."

There's no point in climbing because no one ever really makes it to the top, some people just stand on other's backs to keep their head up while knocking everyone else in their wake down. No one knows why we all climb this mountain of shit, we just do."
