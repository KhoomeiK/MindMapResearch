Everyday I wish that I could just.. not be here, but I am afraid of dying, even though I know it will happen someday.  

Mainly I just want my life to change, but I feel trapped. I'm 50 with no job because I was stupid enough to marry a man who wanted a housewife, so I never had a career, and now I want out of my marriage so bad I have thought about ending my life to get out, but i can't support myself and alimony isn't an option, so here I sit, wanting to live, but also wanting to die.

I play on Sentinals, horde and alliance. I PvP mostly. I used to raid back in MoP, but got burned out on it and found I love healing BG's. 

And yeah, it was awesome meeting him in person, we had a lot of fun together, or at least I had fun. 

I've met several people back in the day when I played Final Fantasy 11.
Dated a few guys on the game that spilled over to real life. Ah the good old days!

hey drawing and writing are great gifts to have! I can't draw anything.
I used to write a lot (really naughty stuff), but haven't written anything in a long time outside of ""how to"" guides for new ball python owners."

Heck I have female friends I give back rubs to (completely non-sexual), and they love me for it.  

I guess my three gifts in life were I'm easy to talk to, and I give massages that are just the best. I also don't judge."

depression,fclemdh,t3_egzqgq,1577746016.0,"I understand completely how you feel! I met someone last year who made a huge impact on my life, and I stopped self harming (cutting, pulling my own hair out), because I wanted to make a good impression on him. Everything was going well until he told me he is planning on killing himself soon, set a date, has a plan, ect. It hurt me so bad I started cutting again.. ugh it sucks feeling so helpless! What has helped me, was i started volunteering at a rescue for abused snakes. No one ever thinks about a snake being abused, but they are very often gotten as pets, and not given proper care and they starve  or get hurt. Helping another living creature to rehabilitate and find a loving home has helped me immensely.  I took in a rescue ball python, and helping him recover has stopped me from cutting. I am now 2 weeks of no self harm. Maybe you could find a local animal shelter and volunteer? I am telling you, helping abused animals really puts things into perspective, and really makes a difference in their lives! Maybe give it a try? Good luck to you and it will be alright!"

depression,fb3k8xu,t1_fb3jipe,1576476057.0,"Yes I will certainly encourage him to seek treatment, but I'm trying not to nag at him like I am sure 30 other people probably have lately. It's hard to be in this position where I WANT him to live and get help, but I want to be as supportive and non-judgemental as possible.

I understand depression all to well. I too have considered ending it all, and have made half hearted attempts in the past.  I was a pretty bad self harmer until I met him, but I stopped when we became friends for a couple of different reasons.

For one, I was trying to make a good impression on him because he happens to be drop dead gorgeous, and two, his opinion of me is important. I generally could care less what people think of me, but his opinion matters because I value him as a person.

I've tried to be as good of a friend as possible and show him the value I see in him.

I know the holidays are hard for him, (hell, they are hard for anyone), and I don't want to bring him down, but I do enjoy sending him gifts, and had something picked out to send him that he once mentioned wanting, but I don't know if I should carry on business as usual and not talk about it, as I am sure he has likely been bombarded with people wanting to talk to him about it lately, since it's my understanding from him that his family figured out he had something planned and I figure they likely crawled up his ass over it.

I got that one brief message from him saying he was giving it more time, to which I responded as gently as I could that I love him, and that i am here for him, and whatever he's going through, I will stick by him.

I know me telling him I love him makes him feel uncomfortable since the feeling isn't really mutual, but for some reason, I think sometimes hearing that we are loved (and without strings or conditions) is just nice to hear."
depression,fb3ivln,t1_faybttb,1576474638.0,"I don't know if I made any kind of a difference in his life, but I did get 1 brief message from him saying he was going to give it awhile longer. 

He had his suicide all planned out, and it was supposed to be this weekend, so maybe it helped him at least a little? 

 If he has delayed it, would it be in bad taste to go ahead and send him a Christmas present?"

depression,fa8853v,t3_e7qvet,1575842631.0,"You are NOT a pussy! There is nothing wrong with being depressed and wanting it to end. No judgement here, I feel that way every day.

I'm not going to get cliche and tell you ""you have everything to live for"" or something like that. But I will suggest maybe you can do like I did, and find reasons to go on?

For me, what I did, of all things to save myself was I started rescuing animals in need to rehab and rehome and give them a second chance.

In my case, I rescue pet snakes that people can no longer care for. I love snakes, I can relate to them. They are misunderstood (a lot like me).

It makes me feel like I have a purpose. They NEED me. Anytime I feel like I can't go on, (which is a LOT lately with my friend wanting to kill himself), I remind myself that i have lives depending on me to be the best me I can be that day.

I wrote this poem for a friend of mine who wants to kill himself. I hope it helps someone.

I have been trying my hardest to be there and to let him know I certainly do understand his depression, I go through it every single day. I ask myself all the time what i have to live for, answer myself ""nothing"", but I can't cash out because I have probably way too many pets that depend solely on me.

I rescue snakes from bad situations, and there is no one but me to take care of them since my family except 1 daughter in Texas who likes snakes, so I kind of have obligations that tether me to this life.

He has kids, and they should be his tether, but he hasn't seen them in awhile and it's tearing him up inside. I get it, I do, I went a year without seeing my kids thanks to a nasty ex. I feel like he is being cruel to his kids by doing this. I want to yell at him, I want to hold him, I want to kiss him, I want to slap him.

I have all these feelings and it's tearing me apart to where I can barely eat, and have to down a handful of sleeping pills just to sleep for a few hours because this has me so torn up.

I love him that much. I know he doesn't love me, probably doesn't even like me that much, but I love love love him and I see so much value in him as a person.

I just don't know what to do. I feel so lost."
