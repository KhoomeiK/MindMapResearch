You can find reasonable price restaurant/finger food bar and stay there after work or school .

Slowly sooner or later you wont feel uncomfortable .

But for the self conscious side is another matter but atlest you solve one problem."
depression,exe0vlp,t1_exe0myy,1566193543.0,"go pub somewhere,drink alone and look around so sooner or later you will know someone there. sometime this little money has to spend and its much better then home.

now i am alone also but most of the time i am at pub drinking alone it feels better then staying home.

&#x200B;

you don't have to drink alot,just chill using handphone surfing that is how i spend my day,better then facing the wall at home.

&#x200B;

if depression exist don't stay at home. always chill outside drink tea,coffee or beer"
