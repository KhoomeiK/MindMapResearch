I have heard that memory can be affected but even when I was manic I can recollect most everything. I thought I was in the CIA and I was getting messages through codes that they were presenting to me while I was in the hospital and basically on the run from my family. Thank you for sharing your story. You‚Äôve given me a lot to think about. I think I can deal with memory loss if I can just get the depression to break and get back to a happier version of myself.
