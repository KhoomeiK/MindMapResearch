-Firstly establish safety. Make sure that you set a plan or she has a way of being safe. This can mean several things, but again safety safety safety.

-Not all women are ready to leave their abusers, and most suffer from something called battered women syndrome.

-Try to hear her out, and actually listen. Empathize and try to make her feel comfortable.

-Reference the nearest center near you and call them. See what services they offer and how they can apply to your situation. Talk to her and see if she might be interested. 

-The key take away is to establish safety, listen closely, try communicate your concerns, and reach a near by abuse center.

TwoXChromosomes,fqkgsj3,t1_fqi7n6w,1589426973.0,"I like to think that this applies to other things other  than porn as well. Replicating what you see on a media, is generally a poor thing to do. Imagine if you tried to replicate the emotional connectivity of two characters, replicate the career of someone from a tv show, or try to imitate other people’s relationship. Generally speaking when it comes to intimacy, connection, and relationships repeating what you see will only end up poorly because it’s unnatural. It’s not in the moment, or real; just a falsified knock off. That’s why I think it’s really healthy to stop porn all together. It just sets such a bad way to form a bond with someone. “You kids’ problem is you over communicate everything to everyone that’s why you can’t feel intimacy”—Georgina, The Politician.

AskMen,fq5xne8,t3_ggwh7k,1589120063.0,"Hi I’m currently training in crisis counseling and intervention here are some tips for you.

First and for most, if you have had depression, or are prone to it; I strongly recommend seeking a therapist. Those of use who have been depressed in the past are likely to develop something called complicated grief, which is grief that is more difficult and dehabilitaing. 

Secondly I noticed that you said best friend. Since this is someone that you were close to and had an immediate bond with, grief will not be short and simple, and I’m so sorry to tell you this. 

Thirdly it’s key to have people with you, especially those who may have also been beavered as well.

I’ll also let you in on a little secret. Counselors are strongly discouraged to diagnose those who are grieving with depression. It’s because losing someone causes you to go into a state of emotions that replicate many of depressive emotions. But like I said if you are prone to depression it’s a little different and you should seek therapy.. My absolute recommendation is to give it the time it needs, be with loved ones, and seek counseling if possible."

unpopularopinion,fq4p55j,t1_fq1r44k,1589080934.0,"Beyond true. Just because society is all accepting and fine now, doesn’t mean it’s actually okay to show emotion. Let’s be realistic and not reddit fantasy world here; when men show emotion they are reduced. People don’t understand men with emotions, and the world doesn’t want to. Ever seen a dude cry? Probably were weirded out and looked the other way. For men to deal with their emotions there are three distinct paths that worked for me, but I’m sure theres many more methods. The first is a true and actual guy friend. One that you don’t consider just your boy, but someone you take comfort in seeing. If you guys have that type of connection they likely won’t judge when you talk to them about certain things. For me my friend was still very unsure of how to deal with it, but he was just there. He listened, and nodded and tried to make me laugh. Don’t think that talking about your problems will solve them no, it will simply allow you to understand them a bit more, it also makes you feel less lonely in dealing with them. Have low expectations when it comes to these friends; but they are still amazing ones. The second is to seek therapy. Good counselors can do absolute wonders, and can make you see your life and issues in a new light. Say you take the same road to school everyday, a counselor lets you see that there has been a shorter more greener road that one can take. They help the most in my personal opinion, their trained for this; but the caveat is that you, and only you can resolve your issues you still do 95% of the work. The third is yourself and this might be the most important one. People are unreliable, and so is the world there won’t always be someone to help, and there won’t always be an answer that can help. You really need to find ways to comfort yourself, and make yourself feel better. You have to act like you are your own friend. Take a jog, maybe read an audible, anything that you value. This is the most effective and permanent way to deal with your emotions. It’s so recognize them, and intervene with them in a healthy way. Emotions are temporary and change in the state of a day. But emotional states like depression, or prolonged anger need some form of intervention; and these three methods helped me the most."
