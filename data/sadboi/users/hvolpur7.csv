CPTSD,fqleifs,t1_fqlcytn,1589455769.0,"ok I think I see what you mean now..it's hard for me to understand because while I was trying to get out, a lot of the behaviors that I would now consider ""symptoms"" are what made staying alive and eventually escaping a possibility. I think certain techniques like the TIPP skill that are meant to get you through in the short-term would be useful for people in this situation...knowing about that probably would've helped me at least"
CPTSD,fql3lzy,t3_gja9l0,1589445065.0,"The thing is I don't think you \*can\* heal until you're in a safe place. Your symptoms developed to protect you, then treatment is meant to help you move away from them when they are no longer needed.. not when you're still in survival mode. I don't think there are going to be any decent resources for healing for someone in this situation because the focus should be on getting to a better place first..."
