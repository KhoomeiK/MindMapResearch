Aan de andere kant, het voelt zo beschadigt en pijnlijk. Het raakte me gewoon enorm. Het doet me echt pijn dat die dingen zonder toestemming bestaan. En het raakt me enorm om te lezen wat het met bepaalde slachtoffers doet (die van dat subreddit). De wereld is vaak zo complex en er zitten zoveel kanten aan dingen, zo vreemd hoe mensen hun opwinding eruit kunnen halen nadat het ze overkomen is. het zal vast een overlevingsmechanisme zijn ofzo, maarja is dat dan erg?

IRLEasterEggs,fqdmuft,t3_ghxde6,1589292878.0,is it the sound of them funding colombian right wing paramilitary death squads?
homeautomation,fqdlrl4,t3_giaatv,1589292286.0,"usb 2.0 spec is 5 meters, but its often shorter when using adapters. it entirely depends on the cable's used. 5v isn't exactly efficient for long distance transmissions especially since its DC. but if there is no data transmission it can probably be stretched a bit. if i where you i'd just use POE for power delivery here, easy enough to do and components and parts rated for this application are easy to come by. or a small solar panel and a battery, zigbee is low power enough for that."
tifu,fqcwy32,t1_fqah9fw,1589271769.0,"that doesnt explain why it doesn't make sense. They believed their contribution mattered forever, that they enacted real change forever. That notion got destroyed."
tifu,fqcwsi9,t1_fqapsjd,1589271615.0,"Yes, but what i mean with all life ending is that their influence stops there. Yes eventually life would restart. But the chance of our lives still influencing that in any meaningfull way is basically 0"

tifu,fqaa7rk,t1_fq9zssa,1589215568.0,"it doesn't matter if beings are selfreplicating or not. If you have infinite time, you have infinate posibilities and thus the chance of all life ending is 100%"
Coronavirus,fqa9x73,t1_fqa0nmk,1589215419.0,ah thanks for the explanation!
Coronavirus,fqa9u7w,t1_fqa37jc,1589215377.0,Are they not checked by journalists and such?
tifu,fqa9r58,t1_fqa8sto,1589215333.0,Do you know the butterfly theory?
tifu,fq9rrd7,t1_fq9p3sx,1589205687.0,it will only cause starving because of a lack of energy and thus kill them. that somehow just sounds like killing them but with more steps.
Coronavirus,fq9rlto,t1_fq9qou2,1589205593.0,Why would it be more sloppy if its public sector lol. its still a hospital with people who talk and journalists who investigate. as if the private sector would not want to silence people bad mouthing just as badly.
Coronavirus,fq9mz0n,t1_fq9mi07,1589202605.0,"yea to me that just indicates further that there is a very very bad culture in that hospital. honestly the whole hospital should be under investigation. the doctor and the wardboy are just the result of pisspoor management, prosecuting them is like only prosecuting low level criminals instead of the mob bosses."
tifu,fq9mnsc,t1_fq95m7h,1589202389.0,"because people like to think that what they do matters on the grand scale. that they are helping mankind or something. if we are always doomed to fail, why do anything? that is why people panic about this. do you genuinely not get that?"
tifu,fq9mcms,t1_fq9gexi,1589202173.0,yea no one is saying that except 23% of the US population who still doubts climate change is mostly caused by mankind. 28% say that climate change in general is not that important to them.
tifu,fq9lxl4,t1_fq9h6cx,1589201877.0,"even if there are other ones, if there is no end then that means that the likelihood of life in general stopping is 100%. just like the chance of a car breaking down is 100% no matter how well you maintain it. and even if there is no heat death, why would it matter? if there is infinite time, all we do is beyond miniscule on the grand scale of things. and if there is finite time, all we do doesn't matter in the end anyways. in conclusion, it doesn't matter. so why not be the best person you can be? you have nothing to loose anyways."
tifu,fq9lkj0,t1_fq9hbu3,1589201621.0,"i mean its nonsense but regardless, entropy will highly likely kill everything. so her realization, which is what the panic attack is about, is still true."
Coronavirus,fq9lacp,t1_fq9f911,1589201417.0,so you could show this symbol to anyone and they'd know what it means and know just how strong the magnet is in an MRI machine regardless of their knowledge of MRI machines?
Coronavirus,fq9l5hy,t1_fq9gt4t,1589201318.0,"well than that employee probably had no training is my guess, if the magnet is never off why would they say that? how did they even have access to the area without supervision or training? sounds like an pretty dangerous environment."
worldnews,fq9kkxp,t1_fq9fjn0,1589200896.0,"lmao great counter argument there. what's next, calling me smartpants?"
Coronavirus,fq9eqei,t1_fq9bxcu,1589195853.0,"if that is clearly stated at the location, and they still ignored all warning signs saying that its not allowed then yea, it is criminal neglect i agree. but it can also point to a broader problem of how the culture is in that hospital. i see this way too often around me. rules are there but nobody follows them. is it then the blame of the first person that gets an accident with it? no its the collective problem the hospital has with its work culture. the culture in that hospital learned the workers that the rules are not to be followed very strictly, and that is where the danger really comes from."
Coronavirus,fq9elxz,t1_fq9cz3b,1589195734.0,how where they clearly in the wrong? could they not simply have mistaken the MRI machine as off? this could've been prevented with a simple warning light above the door stating if the mri is active or not.
