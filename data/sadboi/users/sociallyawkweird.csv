I pick up my handlebars to lift the front wheel off the ground. My BF pulls out the goat head and immediately spins the wheel. We heard air escape for like a second and then it was done. Literally took less than 30 seconds and we were off. I will never not run tubeless."

They emailed me a return label and I sent it back. Second bike was too small (I‚Äôm on the border of small and XS) and went for the XS (an endurace CF). Same thing as above, called told them it‚Äôs too small, got a returned label, sent it back. Third time was a charm.
