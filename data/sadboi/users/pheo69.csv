depression,fofqlfk,t1_fo8sleo,1587741062.0,LOTS of good advise there. I did the same Tue-Thursday thing and it was very helpful as you mentioned. Long days but I could work a little more and my attendance was way better as well.
depression,foee8ar,t3_g679c0,1587701644.0,"Ha ha.  You are NOT a weirdo.  There is a book called “What Color is your Parachute” by Richard Bolles.  http://www.parachutebook.com/   It is a really good book on getting a job but also on finding out what you want to do with your life. It is written by an Episcopal priest so it is very positive and easy to read. I think there are some different versions for different aged people. The way I finally came up with a major took WAY too long but when I went back and read the latest edition of “Parachute” and it was kind of the same process I went through, but better.  You kind of take an inventory of interests and go from there. I was looking at some of the things I wrote and what I “should” have done and was like, “well duh.”UNFORTUNATELY when you have depression, doing that can be challenging so you have to wait for a day when you feel good then read as fast as you can!  Ha ha.  If you want to hear a short, funny story... my Major is Psychology, minor in Chemistry and I work in Computer databases and raising money for a non-profit. 😂😂😂  so hey, you just never know!
I think... if you like this counselor, I would stay on that path. Sometimes people not only have to try different medications, they have to try different therapists. If you have one you connect with, consider yourself lucky. I found a good one off the bat that is good but I have read stories of people who went to ones who don’t fully understand or relate to people with depression.  And hey, if you have a messy background, do one of those zoom calls where you can change the background to look like Hogwarts. 😉  Or move the camera to point at your wall and sit in front of that. Stay strong and take care of yourself! In my prayers!"
depression,fo7xau2,t3_g679c0,1587586136.0,"Oh man!  Have I ever been in your shoes. The depression also made me so afraid and my self esteem so low I couldn’t just make goals and find a major.  I tried but was so lost. I worked and still took a class or two so when I saved up some money and became more mature, I made some decisions and stuck to them. It was long hours and hard work but finally found my niche in the world. You also have to realize.. meds and therapy take TIME. I KNOW you want this junk out of your head but stay with it.  I waited way too long to seek help (you are smart and brave to seek help now. I’m NOT just saying that. It is so much harder when you are older because you become set in your ways a little. If that makes sense).  The meds also take time to find the right balance. I’m sure it took me over a year to find what worked. Hang in there. You might be surprised at what you end up doing. Take care!"

depression,fo0kqst,t1_fnzfo2n,1587414895.0,"I’m sorry you are in that situation. You might be surprised though.. they may have the same issues and relate better that you think. I was in your shoes a long time ago and now have my own kids. I found a note my youngest wrote about not wanting to be alive. My heart hurt for him because I remember being in that same place when I was 9yrs old. We talked and it was really good... probably need to talk again to “check in”. He and my sister are close so I think they talk from time to time about these feelings, which is great if that is more comfortable for him. Parents worry about everything,especially the unknown. If it is known, it is SO MUCH easier to deal with. I wish I had gotten help earlier because the longer you wait, the harder it is to feel better."

I had the same issues you mentioned and it took me quite awhile to finally find my way but I didn’t seek help when I should have.  I thought I could do things on my own and did more harm to myself than good even though I did finally graduate. Someone else said not to sit around too much, and that is great advise. At the time, I had a job so I just worked more hours but I had some employment issues later in life so I did volunteer work.  Best. Decision. Ever.  You never know who you will run into..I talked to someone who directed me to the job I have now and I couldn’t be happier.  It took me WAY too long to get help and it get more difficult the older you get so know that what you are doing.. might feel like it a step back or even failure, but it isn’t. Accept this as a learning experience and just regroup. Praying for ya and you can do it."

depression,fgetwkb,t3_exwoqx,1580709848.0,"Sorry your brain is doing this to you. I used to get SO mad at myself, question why I am here and what kind of higher power would be “ok” with this creation that is me.  Even thinking this pissed me off because I even blamed myself for being selfish and self centered.  It sounds like you have some of the same internal conversations. It took YEARS of self hatred, depression, couple of attempts, two other times.. actually 3, times I was going to cross that line where there was no going back. Guess God may have stepped in but I still have such a hard time knowing why I am here because I still feel worthless and “unnecessary”.   I think you are young. See a counselor.  I waited WAY too long and my thoughts and life kind of became a “rut”.  Like a wheel making a rut on a pathway. Going the same way over and over keeping us in this mindset. A counselor can help you take a better path by seeing your issues from a different perspective then give you tools and advise to do so.  I hope you can find a way to feel better and find some peace without harming yourself.  Take care!
