depression,fod4k8i,t3_g6jgq0,1587679785.0,"It's nice to see other people feel this way too. I always think i'm playing up my depression because I don't fit the ""normal depression"" standards of not being able to do anything/being in bed all day/crying etc. I actively make an effort to take showers, brush my teeth and clean my room but to everyone else that just seems normal. It's genuinely exhausting using so much energy to do basic things. I think i'm slowly improving and what takes effort will just become routine at some point but coming out of that winter slump is always rough. When it's at it's worst I feel absolutely nothing and put my music as loud as it'll go to drown out anything my heads trying to come up with.

I keep trying to give myself breaks from work but when I'm not working on anything I just feel like I have nothing to do and I can't even enjoy videogames or just watch a movie without feeling awful. At least with work I have some kind of purpose, something to keep my hands and mind busy even if it does exhaust me. It might not be the healthiest thing but it's keeping me going, I hope everyone here has something similar or finds something."

leagueoflegends,fg5zia8,t1_fg4jl5d,1580545867.0,"if 1 piece of gay media makes people feel like it's being shoved down their throats chances are they were probably homophobic to begin with, thing is, people would have been absolutely fine if the video featured a man and a woman because thats socially and acceptably the ""norm"". for example, there was no community outrage over xayah and rakan apart from maybe how fucking strong they were on release and that was it. if it was two female or male champions who behave the same way xayah and rakan do, you already know the angry threads and comments people would be making here on reddit about how it's being shoved down their throats and the sjw agenda is out to get them!

i do agree that most sjw culture is too much though, there are so many people who think they're doing something good when in fact they're going too far and make the rest of us look bad. as a lesbian myself, i feel the way they behave is counterprodutive, we just want to fit in but sjw culture goes as far as to make themselves stand out on purpose, makes a spectacle out of something which you should just brush off because who should truly care about your orientation? my point here is that, i think the way the video and varus' lore was done was a great way for representation to be a part of the league, it was subtle and isn't the characters entire personality AND it allowed people to relate to the character/find acceptance with themselves. even neeko, she makes a few comments/has interactions with some of the other female league champs and you probably wouldn't even know she was gay unless she outright yelled ""i love pussy"" at you every time she disguised as nidalee. the people who are mad about that kinda subtle representation are homophobes, through and through. if she did yell that she loved pussy and varus' character somehow mentioned he's technically two gay men fused together with some haunted library paste every 5 minutes then i would understand their anger"
leagueoflegends,fg14zz2,t3_ew6d9s,1580420862.0,"I remember when that video was released, the amount of homophobes made me so ashamed to be a part of the league community, they were asking ""why does this need to be gay, why this, why that.""
this!! this is exactly why.
