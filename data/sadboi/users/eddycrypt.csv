Setting KPIs is very tricky as people would find ways to meet them which might not necessarily deliver the originally intended outcome. Other reasons to fail to set the right KPIs, management lack of understanding of the business they work in, lack of communication from lower ranks to senior teams due to disengaged work force, low morale, fear, disingenuous middle management, etc."

If I had such a product today I think I would dislike it, as it would be too sweet for me. I do still consume sugar thought as it naturally occurs in fruit, vegetables, milk, etc."

sailing,f7c9mlu,t1_f7bgjyl,1573587450.0,"Is there a reddit for those planning or already living aboard?

My view, I have been thinking about it since 2014, and I would suggest you have a plan and put it in place, there are so many questions to deal with.

Getting necessary sailing experience, will I like living on a boat? Will I be prepared for all conditions? Do i know what boat I want? What the boat should have? Do i know how to read weather forecasts?

Sorting out your financials. How much would it cost per month? Can I afford to leave my job? What will I do with funding retirement? If I have to return to the work place, will having a gap have a negative impact?

Sorting ‚Äúhome‚Äù before leaving. Need to sell the car? How often will I be able to see family? What about my belongings? What about bank accounts forwarding addresses?

What are the legalities? Which visas do I need? Where will I live when too old to sail? Medical insurance to cover anywhere? Internet access abroad?"

It does not support validation of smart contract transactions or sharding (split of chain into multiple parallel validation threads for performance). That would come in phase 1 and 2."
