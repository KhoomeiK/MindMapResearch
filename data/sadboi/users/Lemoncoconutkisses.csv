AmItheAsshole,fj8p64s,t3_fbypxn,1583118702.0,"WTF? NTA. I have dealt with a number of EDs over the years, ranging from restrictive in my teenage years to binging now. In general, I’ve found that people who are healthy, and in tune with their bodies, following hunger and fullness cues tend to eat more slowly and take breaks. In contrast, I tend to in quite fast, even if I’m not necessarily binging. 

I suppose some people with restrictive EDs do eat slowly, cut up their food very small, etc in an attempt to hide that they’re not eating much, among other things. However, that is HER problem, not yours. As someone else stated if she can’t handle being around someone eating in what honestly sounds like a fairly normal way, just slower and with smaller bites- she is not at the point in her recovery where she should be going out to eat. ESPECIALLY considering you offered to take the food home instead! Ughhh."

I can get over haircuts, weight (up to the point of being morbidly obese and clearly unhealthy), and height, though I have have preferences for those. 

But a lumberjack, chest hitting beard makes it so that I physically don’t want to kiss someone- scratchy, uncomfortable, etc. Like I said in another comment, I can see a more well maintained chest hitting beard as good looking in some circumstances- or at least not a turn off in a “looks alone” type way. But just the physical reality of kissing what’s essentially a full head of scratchy hair on someone’s face doesn’t appeal to me, full stop.

hardofhearing,ffvjcbq,t3_eveltq,1580265476.0,"I feel like hard of hearing/deaf (little d to denote physically, but not part of Deaf culture) always sticks you in the middle. I’ve been deaf (ranging moderate to profound; hearing aids, then on ti cochlear implants) since I was 2. I’m 30 now, and while I’ve dipped my toes in Deaf culture it’s not something I keep up with- I can sign the alphabet and that’s about it. Rather, I exist in what is by default a hearing world, using aids (CIs, mic’s) and coping strategies (quieter restaurants, lip reading). It’s not perfect, but it’s gotten to the point where I bring out my coping strategies, and those who know/care about me (primarily my coworkers and family) have adapted too- facing me to speak, etc. 

So I guess my answer is, I’ve carved out my own little space! Since you’re newer to this loss, it may take you some time to figure out what situations work best for you and which ones don’t, but after awhile you might find yourself saying things like “oh, I can go to brunch at a noisy place with my sister because she knows how to repeat/enunciate etc, but for this more stressful work meeting I want to be sure to book a quiet room, in the morning when my ears are “fresh””"

Not sure if I should encourage this but I have seen some shoppers go rogue- that is, start delivering on the side to customers they met via IC. If you get a good shopper, you could always offer them this option!"
BeautyBoxes,f682dbl,t1_f680aih,1572724937.0,"You do not need this! Join some Facebook or local swap groups and see what they have after- I guarantee people will be selling afterwards. I still see stuff being sold from 2018 boxes! 

Honestly though I too was weakening- I liked the blanket and the glow drops. But then I realized I also liked the shower speaker and I’m actually deaf and can’t hear anything, so that proved to me that I definitely just have a huge box addiction and FOMO lol 😂"
BeautyBoxes,f681m80,t1_f680vfh,1572724717.0,Thanks! I’ll be stalking them on Nov 6 lol. If you pre order do you see what’s in the box upon purchase or no?
BeautyBoxes,f67itbz,t1_f67cczg,1572719949.0,"Oh!! That explains it, I very rarely wear eyeshadow and never use brushes so I’m not versed in the ways haha. I was like wtf why is FFF selling what appears to be a kids game?"
BeautyBoxes,f678urz,t3_dqjwy2,1572717512.0,"Have the Causebox spoilers been released yet, or does anyone know what’s going to be in the winter box? I don’t know what their timelines are but I was obsessed with the fall one!!"
BeautyBoxes,f6756hh,t1_f66njk5,1572716566.0,What is a colour switch? I googled and it looks like a game but I don’t understand how a game could be duped with a hair donut!
PlusSize,f66vvta,t1_f65tkgo,1572714384.0,Seriously! I’m curious how old you guys are and what his profession is- I can’t imagine anyone in any office or professional environment actually saying something like this! I’m picturing a bunch of 22 year old bro types...
instacart,f66r5bn,t1_f65y9qr,1572713292.0,"One other thing you can do- if you don’t want replacements (eg you want x brand of granola bar or none at all), mark refund instead of replacements when you choose the item. You can also choose a specific replacement (eg. X or Y), or include a note. Don’t be that person who leaves a note on every item, but for example I have had people specify ripe avocados before in that way. 

Unfortunately there’s no way to indicate a why to the shopper that I know of. People choosing mouldy fruit are lazy in the first place- I never buy  produce for a customer I wouldn’t eat myself!"
instacart,f60ws3m,t3_dq576s,1572627815.0,"Shopper here. I’m noticing that you have some terrible replacements, which is obviously not fair- however in the app, there is only “missing” and “damaged” from what I know. If they are replacing badly, but following protocol (scanning the replaces item so you can see it) I would call them out as they shop (hey dude onions aren’t apples, pls get apples or refund). If they’re marking as purchased regular burgers but you end up with veggie burgers (eg. You don’t know til delivery), I would contact IC directly.

There are lazy shoppers for sure and I’m sorry to hear you’ve encountered so many of them. However there are also terrible customers, for example the one that marked their burgers as missing on me- when I KNOW I purchased, paid for and delivered those burgers. In that case, they got free burgers and I got a bad rating. How is that fair?"
BeautyBoxes,f5zs7go,t1_f5zs44r,1572585415.0,She’s so cute!! 😭
BeautyBoxes,f5zrz7z,t3_dpzhwz,1572585201.0,"Hold on, never mind the box- did you get another mouse-creature? I thought there was only one!"
ethicalfashion,f5rifdm,t1_f5rhjcg,1572395106.0,Oh they have such nice looking reasonably priced stuff! But there’s no robes online right now that I can find :(
ethicalfashion,f5qxr3j,t1_f5qx3hu,1572384838.0,TY! I’ll check these out :)
instacart,f5pv73p,t3_doqrlc,1572368424.0,Lol they do not all look like this. And while I hope it’s not it could be a tip baiter as they have up to three days to go back and change/remove the tip.
Makeup,f5jr94r,t3_do30ft,1572237526.0,Stupid q- how do you kow whats oil andvwhsrs wster based? I feel like all would have water and most would ALSO have some type of oil?
BeautyBoxes,f5cotkf,t3_dndn22,1572138420.0,"I’ve heard that Ipsy has a gift subscription during the holidays (eg. someone else could purchase you x amount of months and pay up front). Does anyone know the general details? (When it becomes available, how many months it’s for and price?) Or am I imagining things?"
