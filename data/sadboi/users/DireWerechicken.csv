The dice are there to let you know what happened and it's up to the players and DM to figure out the flavor of the roll. That same campaign I was just talking about ended with my character getting corrupted by the power of the artifacts he was using, chopping off his hand and using both the hand and eye of Vecna. As a cleric of Vecna, he had to sacrifice himself to revive Vecna by removing an artifact that he only used in the first place to be closer to his god. Failed a saving throw and more or less died of shock."
