Cows produce milk because they are mothers, their babies are called calves not veal. They wouldn’t produce milk if they weren’t constantly artificially inseminated to keep up said milk production until it comes to a point where they’re not producing enough milk for it to be profitable enough. Then they’re put down at a fraction of their natural lifespan. Ps. They often develop infections in their udders from constantly lactating and being attached to machines, and that puss end up in the milk you buy. (In the US the FDA allows 750 million pus cells in every litre of milk.)

Bees produce honey as a food storage to survive off during the winter. That’s their food!

The fact that she’s so flippant with the life of another living creature that is fully dependent on you guys for it’s survivals is a bad sign for things to come. If she’s so overwhelmed now when she’s only pregnant and also not contributing anything to the household then how is she going to cope once the baby is here? A baby is going to be much more work than a puppy! Is she going to bail on that responsibility as well?

But OP you really need to stop enabling her behavior by putting your foot down. What you’re doing isn’t compromising, it’s giving into what she wants and letting her walk all over you. You need to start growing that spine and learn how to stand up for yourself because I can already see that resentment towards her shining through in your post and that doesn’t bode well for the future.

Nespresso also has a free recycling program where you can either drop off the used pods at their stores or have them picked up when you have new cups delivered.

I used to have a Nespresso machine many years ago before I started drinking coffee myself for when I had guests over that drank coffee.

The first phase is called love bombing, this is where the abuser makes the victim feel like the most special and beautiful person in the world. The abuser will make themselves seem like the perfect and attentive partner and make the victim feel so loved! 

But the abuser can’t keep this up forever, and once the victim is hooked they’ll slowly flip the script and now instead of love and praise there will be little snide comments about the victims body, clothes, make up, intellect, etc. This is phase two. They do this because they’re inherently deeply insecure people and they believe that by breaking down their victim, they won’t leave them once the real abuse starts.

They’ll also slowly start isolating the victim from friends and family because they don’t want anyone that could go against what the abuser say. Some other forms of isolation could be convincing the victim to quit their job and be a stay at home parent, insisting they drive the victim everywhere, etc.

Now the victim is completely broken down and feel like they have nobody to talk to and nowhere to turn. They’re completely under the control of the abuser and they start to believe that they deserve the abuse they’re getting. This is where the abuse may begin to turn physical.

Can you recognize yourself in any of this? Because I think you can... so please, get out now! It might seem bad now but it will only get much much worse. Trust me, regardless of what he says you aren’t going to be alone if you leave him. That’s just his insecurities projected on you!

A lot of asexuals have a lower low interest in sex because of it, and studies have shown that people who do identify as asexual usually have a lower sex drive than those who don’t, but that alone is not what makes someone asexual.

Sexuality can be somewhat fluid, yes, but not this much and not this sudden. So the fact that you have felt a strong degree of sexual attraction in the past and describe a fairly recent sudden loss of interest in sex and attraction make me feel like it’s most likely something medical and/or mental so I’d advice you to speak to your doctor to perhaps see if there’s an underlying medical reason.

Do I personally get why people miss meat so much? No, because I was never a huge fan. But you don’t need to understand it yourself in order to respect the fact that some people do. 

Ps. You can easily get pasta without wheat. There’s pasta made out of things like chickpeas, lentils and even just other kinds of grains."
environment,flmswsf,t1_flmfyq6,1585295270.0,"No I’m downvoting you because you’re being very condescending and rude in your comments. 

I don’t like Beyond Burgers myself, but that doesn’t mean they’re an inherently bad product. People like you are the kind of people who make the threshold to sustainable and cruelty free living seem so unreasonably high for most ordinary people and give us all a bad name! I know a lot of people really enjoy the taste of meat, and if an alternative like this will be the difference between them keeping a plant based diet and going back to eating meat, then how is that a bad thing? Should they be consumed on the daily? No. But that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be consumed at all! Just because something is processed doesn’t make it automatically evil or toxic, most of our food is processed to some degree or another. Again, moderation is key!

It’s also kind of ironic how your sitting up on your high horse preaching about how processed and unhealthy Beyond Burgers are when you yourself just a few comments ago talked about eating cheese, which in itself is nightly processed, full of saturated fats and trans fats and 100% supports factory farming. There would be no veal industry if there was no dairy industry, dairy cows also produced the same methane."

Maybe instead of sacrificing the old people, the country could just pull itself up by it’s bootstrap and get a second job? Or at least start with sacrificing the old fucks in charge that tanked the economy in the first place by starting these fucking wars and giving tax cuts to themselves and their buddies."

truechildfree,fl7iip2,t1_fl7ailh,1584902442.0,"The moment my water broke, I told my partner to text my best friend. “I need my person there. Tell her to start driving now,” I said, haphazardly throwing clothes into a hospital go-bag I should have packed weeks prior and before waddling out our front door. “I thought I was ‘your person?’ ” my partner quipped, knowing full well where he stands in the hierarchy of my personal relationships. “Yeah, just make sure she’s there. I can’t do this without her.”
I met my person in 2007, the beginning of my junior year of college. I had accepted a job at a local beer distributor to help pay my way through college, and she was teaching me the ins and outs of her previous position. I remember asking her a hypothetical question — something about a romantic relationship I was trying to navigate as best as an irresponsible college student could — when she responded, “Oh, absolutely. More than happy to help. Also, what does ‘hypothetical’ mean?” In that moment — when a relative stranger was ready and willing to help me, and regardless of whether or not she even knew what kind of “help” she was volunteering to provide — I realized I was forging a special, long-lasting relationship.
I knew I had met my best friend.


When being a mom is the equivalent of holding down 2½ full-time jobs, and when more and more moms are working outside the home and still shouldering the majority of the child-rearing responsibilities and household chores, it’s difficult to find, and make, “mom friends.” Yes, I’ve met some fantastic women who are moms — lifeboats, to be sure. But it’s been difficult to turn those acquaintances into enduring friendships. We’re rushing to drop our kids off at school before we’re late and subject to the ire of our child’s kindergarten teacher. We’re sharing details of our lives while chasing our toddlers around the playground, splitting our attention between a life update and questionable playground equipment.
Which is why I have essentially given up “trying.” Am I shunning all potential friendships with a woman who happens to be a mom? Absolutely not. Having someone who knows what I’m going through, even if their life experiences vary exponentially, is invaluable. But when push comes to shove, I need and crave someone in my life who truly “gets me.” And that person happens to not be a mom.

My child-free friend sees past my ability and choice to reproduce. She asks me questions that expand far beyond school schedules, playdates, extracurricular activities and whatever milestone my toddler is supposed to be achieving at the moment. When motherhood threatens to envelope my entire existence, it’s my friend who isn’t a mom who sees the entirety of my worth. She gives me a perspective that surpasses parenthood, a perspective that grounds me when I feel like the trials and tribulations of caring for another human being are more than any one person — or even a couple — could possibly maintain.


She lets me know that I matter more than my ability to get my kid to school on time, to breast-feed for however long that overzealous online moms group believes I should to prove I’m a “good parent,” and that my intellectual prowess surpasses the ABCs and 123s.
Of course, I have plenty of mom friends who provide that level of mental stimulation. Some of the most articulate, smart and influential women I know are moms. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is a mother and a grandmother. Moms ran for, and won, political office in 2018 at historic rates. Choosing to bear children doesn’t automatically diminish your capability to make a difference, and it certainly doesn’t mean you’re a bad friend.
But it’s easy to lose yourself in motherhood and its expectations. Which is why my non-mom friend is so vital; she reminds me of a time when I wasn’t a mom — a time that I sometimes crave, especially when my 5-year-old is telling me he no longer loves me and my 1-year-old is throwing an unmitigated tantrum. When society tells me the most important thing I could do with my body is become pregnant and birth a child, my best friend reminds me that isn’t true; the most important thing I could do is be myself, in whatever form, whatever capacity, and in whatever way feels most authentic and beneficial to me.


My best friend lives on the opposite side of the country. I’m in New York City, and she’s in Bellingham, Wash. And it’s easy to feel isolated when you’re a mom. You’re touched out, courtesy of tiny humans who demand your love, affection and, in many cases, body as a means of sustenance for a significant period of time. But although there are thousands of miles between us, it takes nothing more than a quick phone call to my best friend to bring me back to myself.
When I brought my son into the world, and his 6-pound, 14-ounce body was laid on my chest, I looked for the face of the woman who knew me way before that moment, the moment I became a mom. And when I feel like I’m losing sight of who I am, all I have to do is hear her voice and feel at home."
