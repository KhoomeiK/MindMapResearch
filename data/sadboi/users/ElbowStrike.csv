Without those two things the battery and engine would surely freeze up and not start without a strong boost. I forgot to install my battery warmer this year and when it dipped below -40 even though I had my block heater plugged in my battery froze and needed to be replaced.

It’s a good Idea to start up and idle your vehicle for ~3-10 minutes before actually going anywhere so that your engine oil has had time to warm up to a decent viscosity.

Most people buy special snow and ice tires for winter that are made of a different rubber that is only good below -7 C and then swap back to summer tires sometime in April or May.

Once your engine has warmed up things basically run the same except even at max heat settings on your internal air circulation system you might find that the air inside your car never truly gets warm. Modern features like electrically heated steering wheels and seats help make it more comfortable."
