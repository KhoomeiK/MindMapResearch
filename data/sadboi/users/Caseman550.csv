gamecollecting,fqq91dp,t3_gk9jta,1589561463.0,The app gameeye is good for keeping track if collection. All you have do is scan the bar code on the game and it will enter all the info for you. I would say with collecting Wii or WiuU because most titles are cheap. Im currently building my WiiU collection up right now because the game are so cheap. Out of my 80* games i paid less $15 for most of them. Also 3ds gales are cheap right now so that wouls great choice also.

I’m trying to find a decent priced Melee but thats seemingly impossible since GC games skyrocketed in price. Some copies are being sold for $60+ for Melee atm. Not a big Mario Party fan and I don’t really have any friends who would want to play the GC one since are enamored with the Switch Version lol. I appreciate you taking the time to suggest/comment thank you!
amiibo,fq536st,t1_fpyg526,1589091084.0,"Silver Mario isn’t that rare anymore since that dude extra production runs, he’s only valued on $25 in box. I didn’t open Gold Mario and Boo since he is more rare than Gold Mario tho"

amiibo,fpqfhq5,t1_fpol6m1,1588821615.0,I definitely think they look better displayed out of the box. Started to realize how stupid/tacky a bunch boxed toys on display looks. That was the driving force behind my initial inclination to open them. I was actually starting to feel slightly embarassed. I dont feel that with them on display oob.
amiibo,fpqf0g5,t1_fpopyxx,1588821310.0,Boxes are stored away in a big plastic tote. I used the open from the bottom method.

Gamecube,fpqasw1,t1_fppb8uo,1588818706.0,I havent even looked at what Eternal is getting right now. It was expensive before COVID
amiibo,fpqanzz,t1_fppfx11,1588818622.0,Im not gonna open Boo and Gold Mario for the time being. I couldnt bring myself to do them lol
Shittygamecollecting,fppufbz,t1_fpps3s2,1588809366.0,Right?? I would like to think they got mixed up with Fight for NY but with how high Gamecube prices are right now i wouldnt be surprised if the are aware. I sweat half of eBay’s Gamecube listings currently could be mistaken for this sub.
amiibo,fppu6gj,t1_fpptxa9,1588809226.0,There areva few on eBay for $60 which considering how many people seem covet Boo that isnt a massive hit to the wallet
amiibo,fpps9vu,t1_fppm4ry,1588808164.0,"I didn’t open Gold Mario and Boo. Silver isn’t really rare anymore, its only worth about $25. I will concede i should not have opened Goomba, Wario and probably Rosalina sincehas decent value unopened also."

amiibo,fpop4x2,t1_fpomygx,1588788251.0,They are permanent fixtures in my shrine to all that is Mario so i figured might as well have some fun with them and be able to display them easier
amiibo,fpokoeh,t1_fpok7kn,1588786110.0,"I was just saying if Boo is your biggest regret, $60 isnt all that much to redeem yourself. I never saw Boo in the Wild for retail a few years ago when started collectingvso it was eBay or no Boo for me either way"

amiibo,fpoiu4j,t1_fpohz18,1588785227.0,I already am lol. You can feel they are high quality figure on the first touch
amiibo,fpoi3ll,t1_fpogu3h,1588784877.0,"Thats what I did I have all the boxes
packed away. The difference between Regular Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi Toad, Bowser Koopa, Goomba, Waluigi, Donkey and Diddy are all $11 and under. The most expensive one out of all of them is Boo ($55) and Gold Mario ($40) and didnt open those. I admit i probably shouldn’t  have opened Wario and Rosalina. Either way wouldnt be buying new house or anything if i sold them off"
amiibo,fpogdl7,t1_fpofd1i,1588784040.0,Its a done deal besides Boo and Gold Mario. They arent worth insane amounts or anything and for many the difference in value between loose and in box is only $5-10. Like Koopa Troopa its around $23 loose $30 in box.
amiibo,fpod9iz,t1_fpoayni,1588782540.0,They are running wild and free now (besides Boo and Gold Mario) and I regret not doing it ages ago
amiibo,fpo6hgo,t1_fpo4xlf,1588779218.0,Its reakly not worth a ton anymore is it? Pricecharting has it $40
amiibo,fpo33qk,t1_fpo18ef,1588777508.0,I gotcha i saw a video youtube video of a girl showing a way to open the boxes without damaging them so I was sure. Fuck it you only live once
amiibo,fpo1jze,t1_fpo08mq,1588776705.0,Im doing right now. I have Toad and Diddy open!
amiibo,fpo0p29,t1_fpnznwx,1588776263.0,Is it a good idea to carefully open the boxes and keep them?
amiibo,fpo08zf,t1_fpnzwdg,1588776026.0,I don’t own Smash yet and I’ll admit it’s kind intimidating how good some players at this point. I feel like i missed the boat a bit lol
Ebay,fpnzskk,t1_fpnxjaq,1588775786.0,I sell games I don’t need from lots I pick up but if I’m personally unable to test I still allow a return or I just wont sell it but that’s just me. I do see where you’re coming see where youre coming from tho. Idk what to do now it’s crazy how much the games have increased in value to the point they have since COVID hit. It could be some time before I find the game complete at this price again.
amiibo,fpnyhnm,t1_fpny98a,1588775090.0,Im heavily leaning toward “hell yes!”
amiibo,fpnyfqa,t1_fpnxk1o,1588775060.0,At this point I don’t think I’m going split them up and I’ve honestly never really gotten a chance to use any Amiibo other than green yarn Yoshi. Im also starting to think they don’t look that great in boxes/plastic on a bunch of shelves. I might as well use and enjoy them ya know?
amiibo,fpnxwnf,t1_fpnxq57,1588774772.0,Is $40 and $55 considered a lot for an Amiibo? I dont really know since I only collected the Super Mario waves.
amiibo,fpnxqna,t1_fpnx4pd,1588774681.0,"Silver Mario is currently only valued around $25, gold Mario is $40 and Boo is less than $60"
amiibo,fpnxbyn,t1_fpnwvh4,1588774458.0,"Why just Waluigi? I currently have a shrine to all of them, I’m just starting to think it looks kind of tacky displaying all these in the box and plus I haven’t gotten a chance to actually use any Amiibo yet."
Ebay,fpnwpx8,t1_fpnuqua,1588774120.0,The seller took pics of back of the discs and they  look to be scratch free and in otherwise good shape and they include the original case/manual.  I know I’m taking a leap of faith and I definitely won’t be surprised if the discs don’t work. The reason I’m willing to take a chance right now is it’s a somewhat rare game for a console that is currently skyrocketing in value (prices are 2-3x more expensive than a month ago) and this seller’s price is much closer to pre-COVID prices compared to the few other listings that are posted. Im definitely more willing to try if I know I’m most likely going to be able to return them for a refund.
Ebay,fpnuv2j,t1_fpntrvf,1588773069.0,I didnt think so because I sell on eBay too but I’ve never thought about not accepting returns so I wasn’t completely sure. If the game doesn’t work and I request a return I’m sure I’ll have to wait until I’m able to ask eBay to step in.

Gamecube,fpmtyfu,t1_fpmslum,1588741656.0,"I had a players choice Windwaker and but I sold it recently for a nice profit since I own it on Wii U. I know its not quite the same as on a big screen but I also own Luigis Mansion and Ocarina of Time for the 3DS. I totally forgot to include my Sonic Mega Collection since it’s disc only. I agree on Smash and it was next up on my list but I doubt ill be picking that up anytime soon with the recent increase in GC values, unless I get lucky out in the wild somewhere lol. I honestly haven’t had the chance to play or even watch Billy H multiplayer. What does the multiplayer gameplay consist of? Thank for your input btw I appreciate you taking the time to comment!"
Gamecube,fpmsr8e,t1_fpmlrjy,1588740737.0,What would you add? I had a player choice Windwaker but I sold it about a week ago after i saw how much prices were skyrocketing. I’m not huge fan of yellow player’s choice cover for some reason. I also thsnkfully have Windwaker HD for the Wii U.
