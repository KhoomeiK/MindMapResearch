BPD,fn97ndj,t3_g0322y,1586762305.0,"I'm currently in relationship and there is no way I will give up so much time for another person ever again. This one is okay for now, there are flaws (not only from my side). I didn't want to be in relationship, this came randomly and we've been together ever since. Just saying, never again will I put so much effort into something."
IndoorGarden,fmixfhw,t3_fvjuwp,1586118856.0,"I have the same one! But it's combined with two more cacti. This is my only 'flower' among all the plants I have and it was very special gift. I talk to it everyday, it is so pretty."
ADHD,fmix7wz,t3_fvk4uq,1586118736.0,"Those two in combination are hell. One tells you to stop acting like a retard in front of people and stay calm and quiet and the other one makes you move your feet, hands or whatever like crazy. I have no medication nor I wish to have any. But the combination of those two disorders is really, really bad."
BPD,fmeizkl,t3_fusezc,1586005435.0,"I'm not sure what to recommend to you but if you need to talk you can message me. I suppose you already tried reading, watching films and music. Do you have any plants at your place? Do you write letters and/or poetry or novels? Do you study any languages? Do you take photographs and edit them? Have you cleaned your house lately? It feels like I'm a police officer asking you questions but please don't take it the bad way. I'm trying to help."
BPD,fm7i2nd,t3_fthjrn,1585827758.0,For me that is the worst part of it.
BPD,fm7ai8s,t3_fthjrn,1585819410.0,I wanted the same and now when I have it I feel like it wasn't as important as I thought it'd be. The worst thing is I like this person (I'd say I love this person) but even though he's not a liar I can't find myself trusting him. Is that a thing with BPD? Is it just me? For everyone's sake I hope it's just me because it kills me. And it will kill the relationship as well. That is what I'm most afraid of.

BPD,fkn4bh0,t3_fjb7sf,1584352856.0,"Scars, of course. And then the anxiety that makes
me weird around people and difficulty to be 'normal' around everyone. But what is normal anyway."
BPD,fjtm1xf,t1_fjs9xnl,1583608921.0,"damn, so this is it. yeah, these are the worst days. i have to work with people daily (but leaving this month) and it is tiring me so much, after 2 days of work i can't even move the next day.

what I'm trying to say is, I understand. this is why I love reddit because people here actually understand each other and it makes me a bit calmer."
BPD,fjrze4t,t1_fjq55se,1583591808.0,I meant in what way you collapsep. Mentally?
BPD,fjomjlg,t3_feigw8,1583530776.0,"I love him

He is the worst thing that has ever happened to me


Damn, I felt that. I love him so much maybe too much and yet I always push him away and tell him that us together was a huge mistake."
BPD,fjom8ls,t1_fjolp2j,1583530598.0,in what way if i may ask?
BPD,fjom5ce,t3_feki58,1583530545.0,I guess it's difficult to say my opinion because we don't know his version but I guess it's understandable that you're jealous after what you've been through with your ex partner. It gets really hard with jealousy at times and now I don't remember what I wanted to say but I believe you have to communicate with him (I personally hate the word 'communication' because it's always used against me) and then you will decide if he is trustworthy regarding this matter or not. I hope he is. Fingers crossed for the two of you.
BPD,fjolcdp,t1_fjokyj5,1583530072.0,"Thank you, I'll read some more about it and then I'll give it a try. I really appreciate your help."
BPD,fjokqkx,t3_fega0t,1583529720.0,Sorry for asking such a stupid question but does anyone know if it's possible to learn to do that with one's emotions? I kinda need it to survive now.
BPD,fjkwh83,t3_fdz8uo,1583435272.0,I feel you. I feel like I'm being the toxic one in our relationship with this shit (bpd). I hope the person who is with you is not that toxic. From my own experience I can say I made up different scenarios in my head and lose the notion of which scenario is real or closest to being real. So maybe (and it's no offense) it can be made better.
BPD,fjktn5c,t1_fjkt2i5,1583433669.0,"The uncertainty is the worst part of it. I hate changes in general and I know that change is going to come but this is really difficult for my head. I can't trust him even though he may be trustworthy, it's just that my trust has always been disappointed and it became so scary. My parents haven't made it easier at all. The trust thing probably started with them. Anyway I tried to talk to him, he always says that communication is the key but it didn't help. I thought of going to therapist again but I know that they will guve me medication again and I won't be eating that."
BPD,fjksdgp,t1_fjkpl3x,1583432953.0,There is definitely fesr of trust and I suppose it might be the fear of uncertainty. I find it hard to tolerate myself and it gets even worse when I'm supposed to rely on someone or be dependent on someone. The worst thing is I don't know what to do with it.
