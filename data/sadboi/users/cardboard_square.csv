running,fptjxgc,t3_gfat3y,1588892639.0,"Hey! First of all, heck yeah! I also never did sports in high school or college and am trying to run more., and I totally feel that frustration you can get when you're ""slower"" some days and ""faster"" others. It's all part of the game. And TOTALLY. NORMAL. 


Yeah, I agree with others here - doing 2 miles slowly makes doing 1 mile faster so. Much. Easier. 

Think of it like this. Before you get fancy with it (going FAST) you want to be a little stronger than the challenge. Adding a little bit of length to a run does wonders for making a short and fast run more achievable."

wearables,foatuh4,t3_g1o42o,1587652410.0,"How about a hybrid watch? Excellent battery life, beautiful styles, and they have analog screens that vibrate when you receive a call or text. Fossil makes some great ones, and the hands move to user- programmed positions to subtly tell you who is trying to contact you. An elegant solution, in my opinion, for those who want the fluidity of a smart watch without the distractions or detractions of aesthetic."

\- If you like to be creative with your bujo, make your weekly spreads one week in advance. Too many times have I been given due dates that happen 1 week in the future and I have been without a spread. I would end up scratching down a super down and dirty spread and I wouldn't be happy with it.   


\- Zebra mildliners aren't all they're cracked up to be, honestly

UMD,eu2f8lx,t3_cecvpi,1563388828.0,"I applied to be a candidate. From what I could tell, whatever they tell you, it's a social engineering sorority with some professional events peppered in. I'm too much of a recluse to have enjoyed the culture, but the girls there are hella smart, outgoing, and go-getters. They're also kind."
fuckeatingdisorders,ep5g3xq,t3_bu0sfe,1559055418.0,"I struggled with something similar. The thing is, your partner notices your body changing. If you're worried about it, I suggest stating it outright.  I found for me the best course of action was to be really open with my partner. Say ""I was really struggling, and now I'm getting better and eating safer, and my body is changing because of it as I adjust. I am nervous because I want you to find me attractive and that is important to me that you are happy with me"".  To this your significant other should respond that they want you to be healthy and that you're attractive and their love is stronger than an inch here or there.  


Another thought; competence is the single most attractive trait anyone can have. If they feel like you don't notice your body changing, it seems negligent. Making this recovery a stated, purposeful thing is to take control of the situation, to say ""I am doing this, and I am changing to be stronger and healthier"" and \*that\* my friend, is sexy.   


best of luck, love. I'm really happy for you and your recovery."
