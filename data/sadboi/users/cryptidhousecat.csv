i started drinking when i was 11.
you think i told my parents? no.
i was getting hammered in parks at 5am with people i shouldn't have been with.

you're incredibly lucky your son even waited this long AND came to you first. 
when i did tell my parents (14 maybe) they were just accepted it and offered me a drink if they were having some. 
i quit drinking and partying when i hit 15
literally was more happy sitting at home with my mom having a few drinks rather than lying to her and making myself feel like shit
