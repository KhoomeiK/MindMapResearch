depression,fr3m20e,t3_gmdh67,1589860414.0,"It feels like every day that I wake up, I‚Äôm being pushed more and more to the edge; the more time I spend awake, the more stress claws at my brain that‚Äòs already weighed down by constant melancholy."
depression,fr3glgh,t3_gmb5g8,1589856980.0,"I just cleaned my room a bit after 1-2 months? I didn‚Äôt do it spotlessly, but damn it‚Äôs something- now I can see my floor haha. Congrats to us! ü•Ç"
depression,foysbvv,t1_foxk3h6,1588178266.0,"It sucks doesn‚Äôt it? I always feel like my youth is slowly slipping away from me. I should be having fun, making friends, making memories, dating, but instead I‚Äôm stuck and feeling the time pass while everyone else is making the most of their lives. I lost my teens, and now it looks like I‚Äôm going to lose my 20s as well. It hurts a lot. But I wish the best for you too ‚ù§Ô∏è"
depression,fow06kt,t1_fouxlgj,1588110610.0,"I starting developing depression at 12. I was looking through the comments to see if anyone else was super young too when it happened to them. It‚Äôs good to know someone can relate, but I‚Äôm sorry we both have had to deal with it for so long now :( much love to you."
MakeupAddiction,fj2fojz,t3_fb3h7g,1582942480.0,Omg you look so good! The colors really compliment your complexion and hair color.
MakeupAddiction,fiysck5,t1_fiyryxp,1582845852.0,Do you have any tips on picking colors to blend together? Because I feel like maybe I might pick ones that don‚Äôt match well. Or do you just kinda pick randomly and have fun with it?
MakeupAddiction,fiyr0fk,t3_fagd8y,1582845008.0,You look so beautiful! I‚Äôve just started learning how to do makeup so bold eye looks like that scare me haha- but you do it well!
mixedrace,fe9ese3,t1_fe7hnx2,1578936975.0,"Yeah I grew up in a town with a lot of black people many having ties to Jamaica too, so many of my friends were black when I was in school. But I still think I felt out of place ya know? But I get what you‚Äôre trying to say, besides meeting other poc, just kinda try to embrace being black more/ learn about the history etc, and make an identity outside of a cultural/racial context."
mixedrace,fe9e3q2,t1_fe76uch,1578936725.0,"Thank you for this, I‚Äôll try to love me for me better."
mixedrace,fe9dl77,t1_fe72f74,1578936630.0,Hi! Thank you so much. I‚Äôd love to talk with you. Having someone who can relate is always a plus.
mixedrace,fe9cd2k,t1_fe6qw5o,1578936327.0,Wow 5... I really hope that we both can figure this out then haha. Maybe some people‚Äôs advice will benefit you as well.
mixedrace,fe9c044,t1_fe6pkh2,1578936204.0,Just knowing that other people here can relate really helps too in all honesty. There‚Äôs definitely comfort in shared experience.
mixedrace,fe9bqfa,t1_fe6zgd4,1578936124.0,Thank you for sharing your story. I totally understand trying to almost force yourself to have a connection like you did when you first heard music from Jamaica. I‚Äôll try to just be myself as best as I can and treat those around me honestly.
mixedrace,fe9ahgc,t1_fe6mfx9,1578935857.0,"Yes, I think I keep/kept trying to hold on to any ounce of family connection I‚Äôd get from my father‚Äôs side because I feel so desperate for it. But if it‚Äôs clear they aren‚Äôt interested in keeping ties then I should probably just let it go. Thank you for your advice."
mixedrace,fe99vdd,t1_fe6cidx,1578935671.0,"Thank you for this. I think sometimes it‚Äôs easy to get caught up in my racial identity as an indicator of who I am because that‚Äôs how many people define themselves- through culture, language, etc. But I think it will help me if I try to look past that into the deeper more complex parts that make up who I am. I‚Äôll try to take your advice and work on bettering myself."
