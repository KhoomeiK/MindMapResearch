The series has never been this popular and good. I legit believe some people just go with a negative mind in the game just to find negative stuff and bash on it. Others say “i will never play that shit because it’s not an AC” how do you know if it’s good or bad then? It’s a difficult fanbase. I just advice everyone to get the game but stay away from the main sub."

It has parry, block and abilities. Some boss fights are actually pretty hard. I’ve been replaying the franchise and it really feels like a huge upgrade. I went from wanting to fight anything in Odyssey to “please don’t detect me, I don’t want to go through this again.”

I actually don’t care about the reviews either but it’s just weird how the AC community (some, not all) sees this as a flop. Different opinions I guess.  

Maybe watch some videos on youtube if you’re still not convinced about the combat though."

PS4,ew0cq9v,t1_ew07mrb,1564983464.0,"I mean, that’s your opinion. If the game had flopped, then you would probably be right but the game has amazing reviews and many people love it. It was a success wether the AC fanbase likes it or not. Another year could’ve been good but not necessary.

“I don’t understand why everybody was foaming at the mouth over it.” 
Why are people still impressed when others have a different opinion?

The Witcher 3 is my favorite game of all time, played it about 3 times already and although it is true they took some stuff from it, Odyssey doesn’t “try so hard to be the Witcher 3.” 

Also you seem to be complaining about stuff mercenaries would do or are hired to do. Oh wait, maybe because you are indeed playing a mercenary?

Don’t get me wrong, you can dislike the game and I can understand people that do (some have better arguments than others) but it’s not just “hurr durr Maláka”."

Type on google “ac odyssey reviews” and there will be none below a 9/10. It was even nominated for GOTY last year which is a great achievement and stood besides powerful games such as RDR2 and GOW.

I do not care about reviews myself but most people do, these scores attract lots of people.

I’m not attacking those who want the old school AC back (personally I wouldn’t mind, I loved them and would be up for it) but they have absolutely no control. Doesn’t matter how many videos they make, comments they make and posts against Odyssey they make, it won’t change the fact that AC Odyssey is what it is and will probably continue on being what it is until, eventually, they flop again."

Like man, I get it, they changed the course and you don’t like it. But play something you do like. For example, I was a huge fan of Battlefield series and COD. They both changed completely and now I don’t even look at them. Mass Effect trilogy was absolutely fantastic, Andromeda disappointed me and now I don’t even think about that game.

What I hate about this “old school fans” is the fact that they think their opinion has more value than others.

I’m so, SO tired of every post in social media containing some negative comment about this game. It has been almost a year and people still feel like they need to bash the game as if it was some Anthem 2.0. I even left the subreddit because any love shown to the game isn’t well recieved. 

Like man, just let it go. Not your thing? Then just ignore it. I used to be a huge fan of Call Of Duty Battlefield but both have changed so much that I just stay away from them. I do not go on the subreddit, on their youtube videos or whatever to tell them how trash it is according to my opinion. If people like it then I let people enjoy it.

People that say this game was made with no effort are completely ignorant on how game developing works. In the contrary, they worked a lot to make this masterpiece possible. 

I’m a day one fan. I loved the older ones and specially the Ezio trilogy. The series was dying until they released Origins. Odyssey made many things better. For the love of God, it’s been 9 months, just let it go and just accept the fact thet the game has changed and is what it is."

I’ve played lots of RPG’s (the witcher, skyrim, kingdome come, divinity and many more) and tbh the grind on Odyssey isn’t that heavy (except from 50 to 99 can indeed take twice the time). The game is absolutely worth it. At first I was afraid I wasted 40 bucks on DLC’s but they are amazing. 170 hours in and still counting. The game has great reviews and has sold well.

It’s incredibly ridiculous saying AC Odyssey is as different from the other AC games as Watch Dogs is. You’re just reaching out to proof a point you don’t have. There’s much more to AC than just a hidden blade and a cap. Yes, the Isu part but also the spear of Leonidas, the blood of the marked ones, the cult of Kosmos. Can you really call yourself an AC fan if you only like less than half of them? It’s as if AC “fans” rather see the series die than take another direction. Origins is how it all started and Odyssey is basically the ideology. You get the idea when you return to the pyramid and see the visions. I’m gonna leave it at that."
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,etwc9sd,t1_etwa6yt,1563263021.0,"“Shoving a spear down someone’s head is not assassination”

An assassination is an assassination, wether it be with a gun, knife, spear or spoon, it stays an assassination. Don’t be gatekeeping on what may  or may not be concidered as an assassination.

Definition: Assassination is the act of killing a prominent person for either political, religious or monetary reasons. - Wikipedia

Even though the ones before were more stealth centered, you could still fight 5v1. 

The ones before were not well recieved but concidered AC games and the last two are great games that pretty much saved the series, yet people hate them because they’re not an AC game. Conclusion: people are never happy.

The Ezio trilogy is pretty much the one that stand out the most. Black Flag and the first one were good. The rest is okay-ish. To me there are much, much weaker games in the franchise. But I’ll assume 70% of the people who cry about not being an AC game haven’t played it yet or played it but quit before exiting Kefallonia."

cyberpunkgame,epobuzz,t1_epo95vw,1559341709.0,Wait is the mod joking or you’ll really get banned just for saying that?

cyberpunkgame,ep74wuf,t1_eoyr4uv,1559077371.0,"Definitely. Got kicked from their Discord server because Someone posted a question on the wrong channel (was unrelated) and I answered. Got off with a warning but I didn’t join back in because it really threw me off and felt like I was back in school (as you said). There are great moderators too, but some go around swinging the Mjölnir just because they feel good “working” for one of (if not the) most anticipated game. It kind of disappoints me because I love CDPR and their games. They’re supposed to be very chill and (customer) friendly. Then you join this sub or the Discord server and get treated like a kid."
cyberpunkgame,ep7474x,t3_btf812,1559077110.0,"I kind of feel like Cyberpunk 2077 moderators here and on Discord are over all too tough. Besides being too strict here, their discord server is very strict too. I remember getting kicked because someone asked a question on the wrong channel and I answered. They kicked me with a warning but I didn’t join again because it kinda threw me off. Also, they didn’t want people discussing speculations because it was getting repetitive for them even though there were newcomers with a lot of hype that wanted to talk about it. Don’t get me wrong, rules are necessary to keep things smooth and there were some great moderators too, but others feel powerful because they’re “working” for the most anticipated game."
