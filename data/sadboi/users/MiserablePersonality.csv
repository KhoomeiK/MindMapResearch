Stress hormones are a bitch, but there's both a rare disease, Cushing's disease, and Cushing's Syndrome- which, no matter what Google thinks, aren't the same thing. Cushing's disease is caused by a pituitary tumor (have had twice, as mine were caused by a rare genetic disease called MEN1, for short, which I could develop again completely randomly. 0/10, do not recommend) and Cushing's Syndrome is caused by steroids (not the ones used for muscles, ones used for medical treatment). Every heard of people who struggle with their weight, and other unpleasant symptoms such as mood swings, when they talk about medical steroid treatment? It's like that, though the side effects don't always elevate it towards Cushing's Syndrome levels.


And sadly, Cushing's disease frequently does undiagnosed, especially in girls and women, because doctors just say they're not exercising enough and are eating too much. They'll say you're lying if you say it's not true, even if you have actual witnesses to attest to the truthfulness. (Such as, say, the single mother of a 13 year old. When said 13 year old has no access to money to secretly buy junk food and no place within many miles that actually sells food. And no friends nearby to secretly give them junk food. I can't even tell you how many doctors said that to my face.) The other symptoms are brushed off as in their head. It tends to go undiagnosed for years, sometimes even upwards of 10 years. Being sick with a lack of diagnosis can ruin marriages and cause other family to act as if they're lying, crazy or both. With doctors and your (alleged) support system telling you that, many people come to believe that. And sadly, even with testing showing abnormalities (""It's just a *little* outside the range!"" Outside is outside), many doctors will not tell you about it or continue to pursue a diagnosis. Not just with Cushing's but with just about *anyone* that's, in their eyes, overweight. Actually medically obese? It's far worse.


I started to get sick when I was 9 and I'm now 35. Testing has gotten better over the years, which is fantastic. *If* the testing is done, if abnormalities are paid attention to, especially in combination with listening to what a person's symptoms are. Sadly, the attitude and treatment (especially of girls and women) has not changed much at all since I was 9, at least not inside the U.S or Canada.


If you're either overweight, female or a person of color, most doctors don't treat any of those very well- and that's been proven through research and studies. I know from personal experience being 2 of 3 is bad enough but I cannot even imagine being all 3. There are many things that can cause weight problems (and other symptoms) that are so often brushed off due to fatphobia. At worst, there's horrible vitriol- even people who will tell you to kill yourself or send death threats- if you even dare talk about that, especially online.

I had some flashbacks at the part where they mentioned our gut bacteria being disrupted towards antibiotics. First, I got c diff infection from antibiotics but literally no one mentioned it's infectious- think about how many fecal particles, normal ones, are basically everywhere. So my mom caught it from me while I was still in the hospital for it *and* something else (that's a long story which isn't entirely relevant to what happened next). Unfortunately, my mom's infection resisted all the then-current treatment. She lost so much weight over the next year she was on death's door when she was offered a still experimental (barely) treatment for free, by the doc that pioneered it. Fecal transplant! It saved her life and is now an actual treatment for treatment resistant c diff. So that shows just how important that bacteria really is. (And unfortunately, once you've had c diff once, you're much more likely to get it again. They do NOT tell you about c diff or that little factoid when they give out antibiotics. I think that should be criminal.)"

People are changing literally every minute of their lives. Every moment, every experience, every thought shifts us. Some people don't move as much, especially if they aren't terribly introspective- that isn't an insult, some people just aren't. (Amd some people *can't be, but I'll get to that in a moment.) But that doesn't mean they're entirely static, either. So why on earth would it be it be different for sexuality? In so many places, we constrain people's exploration of their sexuality and romantic attraction, sometimes from birth. Take a religion that condemns same sex attraction and then enforce it by raising children to believe that. Even if that's not enough to convince them to *not* explore it, the social consequences can be enough to discourage it for a long time. How many gay or bisexual minors have been kicked out onto the street when their family finds out? Far, far too many. If they don't find out, the fear of losing their entire family if they *are* found out has kept many an adult silent for a very, very long time. Some people explore it in secret, some never do at all.


That isn't the only way people can be constrained. I'll use myself as an example: my ability to explore has been hampered by chronic illness and disability since I was 14 years old (I started getting sick when I was 9 and was nearly entirely debilitated by 15, when I had to drop out of school). I knew I liked boys both romantically by age 8, even if romance isn't a word I knew intellectually, I knew. Not that I could explore it at that age anyway, because I clearly had cooties. But it didn't help I moved all around the world quite often until I was a teenager due to a parent who was a government contractor. (So there's another possible limitation- different and cross cultures. Because if you think, say, Americans and Italians come at it the same, do I have some shocking news for you.) I knew I was sexually attracted to men by 15 because *hello* Hugh Jackson as Wolverine. I figured it made me straight, as society seemed to deem it that way. As I noted, though, I was sick and dating was not on the menu. Hard to be when you only leave your home for doctors appointments. I had a 1997 IBM computer, shitty dial-up and no idea how to use anything other than basic chat rooms. Not exactly conductive for me to explore anything (though it may well have worked for others). At 18, I was still sick and trapped at home. But ah, I had a PS2 and discovered MMORPGs were a thing! Quite different from chatrooms, for me. It gave me a way to explore romantic feelings, which I thought was tied to the sexual. So I was then really damn confused at 19 when I developed romantic feelings for a girl (yes, yes, we know people can lie about gender online, catfishing and all that, but I knew her as a girl). It didn't work out, but it was ok. At 20, a friendship with a guy who'd I'd known since I first joined developed into a romance, which turned into an offline, proper relationship. It was long distance, but that was ok. And the  he sexually assaulted me shortly before I turned 21. I couldn't admit that for over a decade, but I did still break up with the dickhead. I wasn't really keen to try anything after that, which worked out fine because my health tanked even more and I couldn't (thankfully it killed my sex drive for a few years so that didn't really bother me). I still ached for a romantic relationship but I didn't have the energy to even try.


I had romantic feelings for a few women over the years, which continued to confuse the living daylights out of me. When I was 28 I discovered through various conversations that it entirely possible to be romantically attracted to the opposite sex but not *sexually* attracted to them. I don't know if that's me or not, because I still haven't been able to explore anything with any gender. I want to, very much so. But I'm disabled, bedbound and hardly able to sustain a few online friendships. So romance and sexuality? Ha. No. That's not uncommon for people with chronic illness and disability (but that absolutely doesn't mean many of us want and sustain sexual and romantic relationships, of course). My reddit account basically eats up what little energy I do have now and it's… really not much at all. Writing *this* was fucking exhausting and I habe a headache now, so yay.


I normally wouldn't have written this but last night I was struck by both romantic and sexually attraction by a very popular female singer and songwriter. I'm under no delusion of any kind of relationship, of course, but it made me realize the *potential* and that there are parts of me I still don't know. I do know I'm still romantically attracted to men and *staggeringly* sexually attracted to men. But who knows where things could lead with a woman? I don't but I definitely know that *no one else* does either. Certainly not someone who has never met me and knows nothing about me. (And who knows, maybe I'm kinky too!) Human beings are fucking complex, dude! Don't pretend you've got a fucking manual because of *your* personal experiences.


And just as a bonus, something that can and absolutely DOES fuck up development and exploration? Sexually assault. Rape. Child molestation and rape. Child molestation, rape that's perpetrated by a relative. Blaming *yourself* for those things- yes, even a child can be made to think that. Then let's add families protecting and defending the rapist and silencing and/or blaming the child. Or society doing the *exact* same thing (three guesses who the latest famous person it's happening with). Top it off with zero counseling or therapy. Are you so sure you can definitively tell those people where their sexuality will end up?

There *can't* be equality in this situation because men obviously can't get pregnant. Pregnant women face higher levels of domestic violence, are less likely to get hired for jobs and sometimes get fired for being pregnant (yeah, yeah, it's illegal, but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen). They may well not get to take maternity leave, or only a small amount, because they can't afford to not work- some women have to go back while they're still healing *from giving birth* (and even longer if it was a c-section). So until men face those issues or women face none of them, the situations cannot be treated the exact same way. They just can't.
