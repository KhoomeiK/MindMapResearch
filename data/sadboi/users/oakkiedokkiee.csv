I’m sure DBT in combination or on its own (with medication or without) will allow you to regain control of these ideas.

BPD,f0pvp2n,t3_d64iru,1568848580.0,"I used to get them as a child, I’d see gravestones on the side of the road and imagine if it was me who had died and if anyone would care enough to leave me flowers. I’d also get other ones that made me terrified of the dark and windows, because i had convinced myself they were real and the only way I’d be safe was if I ran away. 

After a year or two of therapy I was able to overcome them. Now I only get them if I’ve been really stressed or missed my meds.

Hope you are able to overcome this, it’s a great relief when you do."

mentalillness,exwc9tc,t1_exwbfcn,1566617312.0,"What is your stance on mental illness, if you don’t mind me asking? Because frankly it doesn’t look to positive from my standpoint. 

Honestly, he’s just different to your normal, it doesn’t necessarily mean he’s mentally or physically ill and too assume so and try to label him when he’s happy and content, seems a little out of line. 

I can bounce from a to be and yes I may have a mental illness but the two don’t coincide with one another, just depends on what other factors are going on. 

I think that if he’s happy and unfazed by what others think of him, then it may be time to just move on from this, because frankly it isn’t your business really. 

If it was something both of you were concerned for then I’d say differently but by the sounds of what you have said he doesn’t seem bothered by the fact that he’s different or what people think of him, and that’s something really rare in today’s society and he should be proud to embrace who he is no matter what."
mentalillness,exw4u5q,t3_cun8bz,1566612770.0,"Look, first of all, it’s probably best you don’t try to diagnose or label your friend. 

Kids are indifferent, peculiar and outgoing, as they are trying to discover themselves and thief interests and boundaries. So there are bound to be some moments where they may seem a little confused with who they are, or the way they present themselves. 

About his potential sexuality, just let him be. If it’s something that makes you uncomfortable or you don’t accept him, then it’s best you let him go. If he is apart of the LGBT+ community then he’s already possibly been through a lot. It’s hard for some to realise and come to accept things like being gay, queer, trans etc and can take a while to fully come to terms with.

The best thing you can do is be there and support them, as long as they aren’t promoting violence towards themselves or others. 

If you are really concerned, maybe speak to a school counsellor. They have a client confidentiality agreement, so your friend won’t know it was you."
mentalillness,exw3rzd,t1_exw3igh,1566611924.0,"That’s true, however some people ( like myself ) prefer not to rely on other people I live with my responsibilities. So the limited medication worked better for me."

mentalillness,exvm4m8,t1_exvljhc,1566602043.0,"Thats more likely due to the legislature in your area and depending on how regularly you see your doctor, if they still believe that you may be at risk of attempting. 

It took my doctors almost a year to believe me when I said I didn’t want to hurt myself anymore. But I’m glad they waited, because I wouldn’t be here if they hadn’t.

Recovery at times can be daunting, with new things being prescribed, new therapies being suggested, it can be overwhelming. But believe me when I say that taking that first step to a healthier self, is the best thing you can do for you. You’ll wish you had done it sooner."
mentalillness,exvlnrq,t1_exvl5zw,1566601729.0,"Just make sure to make your doctor aware of your condition and any other medications, as adding or increasing a certain hormone into your body, can take a little bit, and can have varying effects. So please be transparent with your doctor, and if you think it’s time to seize using said contraceptive, even before the trial period is over, don’t let your doctor push that.

In saying that, I wish you all the best in your recovery!"
mentalillness,exvl6o9,t3_cujns7,1566601406.0,"If you have a history of self harm via medication, it’s most likely that they will only provide you with a small enough amount ( usually enough for a week) to prevent you from being able to attempt. If they don’t do this right away you can ask if you don’t trust yourself. 

It can be scary at first, because they are legally required to disclose and ensure you understand the potential side effects. But as long as you follow the usage instructions, are transparent with your doctor about any side effects, you’ll be okay.

Just go in believing that they will work and that you’ll be okay and I’m sure you’ll find they aren’t as bad as they are made out to be."

I haven't gotten bad since. Nothing I couldn't overcome.

If you are feeling unsafe or think you may need to admit yourself, please do. It's always better to be safe.

Write down a list of some small things that you can do when you feel like harming, that make you feel better, whether it's being productive by making your bed, peaceful by reading your favourite book, or just changing your situation to be a bit closer to where you want it.

My psychologist told me, that you are never going to get out from this sadness if you allow yourself to sit in the same place that's making you unhappy. For me, my life wasn't bringing me joy, there were aspects I wanted and needed to change to allow myself to be okay, but I never bothered. The moment I worked on my situation, I immediately noticed the change in my outlook.

You're going to be okay. You're not alone. Just take things one step at a time and you'll be just fine."
