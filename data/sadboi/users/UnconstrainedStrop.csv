I firmly believe diabetics and those with multiple underlying health conditions* should be shielded.

Office for National Statistics data released this week has shown children were as likely to catch coronavirus as adults.

Azeem Majeed, a professor of primary care at Imperial College London said the data suggests that previous studies, based on hospital admissions, may have underestimated the rates of infection in children.

An Imperial College study found that school closures had reduced the death rate by between 2 and 4 percent, but the impact on peak intensive care unit bed demand is much higher—between 12 and 23 percent.



I disagree with the end, where he suggests individual schools should do their own risk assessments and decide how to proceed, given that our headteacher and the entire trust have shown that they are extreme outliers in their attitude towards the pandemic. They insist they can enforce social distancing for the youngest children, meanwhile the leader of the headteacher’s union all the way down to teaching assistants and parents have said its impossible.

Their attitude seems to be get them in school at 2 because clearly parents are useless pieces of shit who can’t do anything to educate a child and education is above all priorities in life, and don’t let them go no matter what. Unless of course your child becomes a danger to himself or others, then continue to blame the parent, don’t put services in place, and cut his time in school down to 2-3 hours and send him home instantly if he misbehaves.

I have a child (from a previous marriage) living in a different city, 2.5 hours away. She’s already socially isolated before lockdown. I’d want to prioritise my kid, obviously. 

I can see it becoming a total mess."
CoronavirusUK,fqmc2qb,t1_fqm00ws,1589474978.0,Meanwhile our school is saying it will be safe as houses. Our headteacher seems to have this magical ability no one else does to keep the kids social distancing.
AskReddit,fqm7alc,t1_fqkw0fh,1589472717.0,"This happened to my kid. He slipped into the pool while I was on the other side, and it really doesn’t look like there’s anything wrong. He was fine, under water less than 10 seconds, but it was scary af all the same."
todayilearned,fqld3h3,t3_gj80qd,1589454481.0,"We went to one, it wasn’t quite what I expected. It was a huge field of dirt, and it was soooo hot outside. We didn’t find anything but it was a fun experience we’d never had before. We also went to Magic Mountain."
AskReddit,fqkx1bz,t3_gj3f98,1589438842.0,School is temporary.
oddlysatisfying,fqktd2h,t1_fqjbabc,1589435728.0,Thanks. I hate that fucking song. Now it’s going to be stuck in my head.
Coronavirus,fqi5lr6,t1_fqi0zk1,1589390566.0,"Sadly judging by what the pm in England has been up to, and the way people involved in my life act, they will not learn a damn thing here."
CoronavirusUK,fqi2y0f,t1_fqhvlne,1589388978.0,"I agree, unfortunately. I think it will be full steam ahead regardless. Them saying schools ‘may not’ open IF there’s a rise again just barely gives time to see if the easing will cause a spike, so they will just continue on and open schools because it will be ‘too late’ to stop it all."
aww,fqhr33i,t1_fqh6flp,1589382697.0,Ah so bob the builder really did need to build that bridge for the family of hedgehogs. I’ve never seen one in the wild before!
DiWHY,fqh2ogo,t3_giqq4y,1589365747.0,It depresses me that there are people out there with money to burn on resin and they do crap like this.
CoronavirusUK,fqgz3m2,t3_gissxy,1589362171.0,I am one of those people the government has just completely ignored. So I got yelled at yesterday for trying to protect myself and my family by saying my year 1child won’t be returning to school in June. His teacher (assistant headteacher) and headteacher tried to strongarm me into agreeing to let him go in. They basically told me to get over it and take the risk. I’ll be showing them this article.

Minecraft,fqfau31,t1_fqdbfrs,1589321637.0,"This isn’t totally related, but I was playing the latest snapshot today and the smithing table has a use now, I wonder if the fletching table does as well. I’ve come across fletchers before, but not in the latest snapshot world. Will be interesting to find out!"
Coronavirus,fqf9p2y,t1_fqesood,1589321071.0,"The first article says at the end there is no evidence that the antibodies lend any immunity. And a 6 week old recently died from COVID-19. I don’t think the news that babies don’t get it in uterine is surprising, but it’s not looking promising that mothers who are infected will pass on any immunity to their newborns."
AskReddit,fqf7jc1,t1_fqduz64,1589320025.0,"I wouldn’t rush to any conclusions, babies often make progress, then seem to stop for awhile out of nowhere, but what they are actually doing is concentrating on learning a new, different skill. 

I’d keep an eye on it, obviously, and talk to her doctor if it continues, and if she doesn’t seem to be making progress in her development. But chances are she’s fine!"
CoronavirusUK,fqf51ob,t3_gi5xdl,1589318845.0,"I had to talk to my two younger kids’ headteacher and assistant head today. They’ve bought Bojo’s bullshit hook, line, and sinker. They doubled down when we asked how they expect kids to social distance, in spite of so, so many people who know what they’re talking about saying it’s not possible. Their own union leaders are saying it’s reckless to reopen schools. The head said ‘But India is reopening their schools!’ I wanted to bang my head on my desk. 

And they sent out an email saying the government are NOT recommending PPE use in schools, unless a child has symptoms of COVID-19 (wtf?! Why would they be in school then?!), or has special care requirements. 

Let that sink in a moment. They are specifically saying to NOT use masks. Even now. And in schools. Where kids like mine, who just earlier this evening full on sneezed all over me, would be attending."

Damnthatsinteresting,fqeqe1l,t3_gi56pu,1589311870.0,It’s precious and hilarious at the same time how some of them step directly on the wire while high-stepping to get away from said wire. 😂

oddlysatisfying,fqauy11,t1_fqaec66,1589225723.0,"Definitely agree. I didn’t get a chance to get addicted, or even squire a taste for it. It really did taste like sweet beans. It wasn’t awful by any means, just definitely not something I was accustomed to, and trying to wrap my mind around the taste was difficult, for the reasons you said."
