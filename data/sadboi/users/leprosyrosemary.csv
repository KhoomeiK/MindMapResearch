AskWomen,f3iqbyl,t1_f3f6jy4,1570940634.0,"I had to sleep with a dude (he's now my husband) so he would teach me how to drive when I was 21. Two of my parents greatest fears rolled up into one: me having sex and me driving. I have been a licensed driver for 5 years and have never been in an accident.

Meanwhile, my brother took and failed the test several times. He was allowed to drive throughout, regardless of the legality. They taught him to drive and over the past 8ish years, he has totalled 4 cars and a motor scooter.

Despite them keeping that milestone out of reach for me for so long, I definitely won out in the end."

For this situation, perhaps asking her permission in the moment would suffice? It even gives her the opportunity to manuever the situation to something she's okay with in a sexy way. Like, hey honey can I cum on her face? And she responds no, but cover her chest so I can lick it up."
