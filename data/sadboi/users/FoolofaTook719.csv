AskReddit,fqn9gwn,t1_fqn93ym,1589490934.0,"No. (Feel free to shout, ""Isildur."" If you get the reference, I love you.)"
AskReddit,fqn8zcg,t3_gjn5vc,1589490695.0,"""Calm down."" I can calm down all on my own with some TIME. Telling me to calm down isn't going to magically make me feel better. 

""Some people have it worse,"" followed by talking about starving children or homeless people. So because I'm not homeless or starving, I shouldn't have any other problems? 

""If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best."" Excuse me, WHAT? So if I can't handle you pushing me around and you being an asshole, I don't deserve you when you start acting decent? Sounds like I shouldn't be with you at all. 

""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger."" But it can also make you wish it did. 

""Men are trash."" Honey, you're trash. Gender has nothing to do with it, stop justifying your hate. 

""Boys will be boys."" Do I need to explain this one? I sure hope not. 

Just the word ""bitch"" in general can be so condescending. For example, my brother referred to his friend's girlfriend as his friend's ""bitch."" Excuse me, WTF? I shouldn't have to explain why this is so obviously wrong. 

""You're too sensitive"" or ""you're just mad because I'm right."" Yes, I am absolutely angry because you're right. /s On another note, I'm sorry you don't have any empathy. 

""That's gay/retarded."" And? You have anything else to say? This is so much worse when it's something most people do (Like when my dad said that a guy who likes to be clean is gay. Yes, because men love germs.) As for ""retarded,"" that as an insult should've died a long time ago. 

""Toxic."" When used incorrectly, this can become very irritating. 

""You don't know anything about parenting because you don't have kids."" Heard it in a movie once, it automatically made me hate the character who said it. I don't have kids so my opinion isn't valid? I have a younger brother and sister. I know enough to know that parenting is hard and what you're doing is obviously wrong. 

""Like this or [insert giant spider or Samara from The Ring] will appear in your room/bed at 3 am."" I'm not afraid of spiders, I'm going to be asleep, and I have different ways I can try to get rid of spirits. 

""You don't have an opinion because you listen to KPop/watch anime/play a certain video game."" And neither do you, you Candy Crush playing, documentary watching, classical music listening asshole. (I actually do enjoy documentaries and classical music, I'm just making a point.) 

""Roblox/Minecraft/other game is for children."" Perhaps children are the main audience, but people will do what they want. Go play Candy Crush. 

""Eat healthy/sleep well/go outside."" Mate, that's not a magical cure for depression. 

""Pray."" I have. But sometimes, maybe God wants us to act. Stop being lazy and do something, y'know? 

""You're not a true Christian because you [insert something ludicrous]."" Nope, I'm definitely not Christian because I listen to rock music. /s You aren't either, Karen. I see you over there listening to Tupac. Keep being a hypocrite. 

""Stop being sexist/racist,"" and then proceeds to say something sexist/racist.

And finally, I've seen this plenty of times. ""I shouldn't have to capitalise God's name because I don't believe in him."" And I don't believe Frodo Baggins exists, and I still capitalise his name. No excuses for poor grammar. I don't believe in Poseidon and I still capitalise his name. This isn't a theological issue, it's a language issue. 

Sorry this was sooo long. So many things I've heard have made me angry upon hearing them."

writing,fkdg9od,t3_fhr17m,1584077685.0,"I usually just create stories for these characters where they're just living their lives. Screw things up a bit, but make sure to balance out the bad with some good. Write a character with a mental illness. Write a character with a physical injury that affects them for life. Write a strange character with a strange personality. Give some characters some strange fears. An example of what I stated at first: I have a story of a lovely couple. They have a child, the wife has had a stillbirth, and the husband has been a victim of two violent crimes (attempted murder) before and survived. However, the two still love each other, enjoy having their daughter, and other good things happen. I don't have a particular goal for this story, and I don't know how or when I'll end it.

writing,fkdf16v,t3_fho9rg,1584076492.0,"From my experience, it's kind of like this: I usually feel cringe when writing scenes like that. I'd say that it's very possibly a natural feeling just about every writer gets when it comes to this. You don't have to write it in full detail. Just suggest that it happened. For example, I have written two characters that had a very romantic night. A lovely dinner, followed up by going to the bedroom. Just the two of them. I did choose to go a bit further with detail, but nothing too much. If you want to write details, don't detail it too much. If you do it too much, it will come out like a horrible fanfiction. Show how the characters feel. Are they happy? Nervous? Sometimes adding a small bit of awkwardness can make it seem so much more realistic. Use it to your advantage, but again, not too much. I suppose at this point, I'd just say that most of the time, less is more and more is too much. At least in my own experience."

For example, if I don't keep the bathroom mirrors closed, a ghost might appear in them if they're left too long. Shower door/curtain can not be closed if I'm not taking a shower, and always have some sort of electronic device if I'm in the bathroom at night. Don't shower at night unless necessary, and if I do, don't close my eyes. Look under bed, keep windows closed at night. Keep window curtains closed, too. Don't turn my back on open doorways (because of this, I have to sleep with my door closed). Also stay in bed all night, and if I have to use the bathroom, I must be fast, and must use light to navigate through the house. I'm not usually superstitious, I'm just really afraid that a ghost will kill me if I'm not careful. Or worse. I don't know what worse is, but I don't want to know. I'm also very afraid of mirrors. If I feel uneasy around a mirror, I simply won't use it. I don't like to be alone in public restrooms, either. Afraid that the lights might go out and something may go very, very wrong. Oh, and for some weird reason I'm afraid of cremation. I'm afraid that I might wake up half burned alive. Man, the thoughts that run through my head. 😅"
