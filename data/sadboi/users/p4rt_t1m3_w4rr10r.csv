Also, the human mind distorts and alters memories so it’s possible she wasn’t as bad as you remember or she doesn’t remember being as bad as you say.

asheville,fiz7lpg,t1_fiz6382,1582856047.0,"Ayyyy, thanks for being a good sport man. Pretty rare on reddit. Cheers!"
asheville,fiz7e0a,t1_fiz5mo8,1582855905.0,"Here’s the best way I can explain it: when I was a child I was notorious for not socializing with people my age. Being 9 years old I was having complex conversations with people triple my age. And that trend has continued throughout my life. Hell, the first girl I fell in love with was 3 years older than me. I have always been more mature than my peers.

A) I have experienced far more than I care to admit on here, good and bad. You may be right about other people my age wanting to live wild and free but those days are already behind me. I have a car, a good paying job and my own place. I do really want kids and (in case you aren’t aware) any age past late 20s your chances of having children with disabilities increases exponentially. I refuse to risk having children when I’m older because honest to God that is a fucking cruel thing to do knowing that. My energy is spent; I’m not a partying 20 year old any more, I’m a grown ass adult.

B) You could label me as desperate as it seems fair. However I’m only desperate because everyone these days is hooked on drugs and loves mindless partying and sex. All I want is my significant other that I can lean on as I continue on through this journey and I can boost them too.

C) I’m sure being single would rock if you’ve already been through a few solid relationships but as someone who doesn’t want to just have sex with strangers I do not find it quite so awesome.

I mean no offense towards you, I’m sure you’re a wonderful person (hell, you took the time respond and I appreciate that) but this is the same type of spiel I’d heard from the girls I’ve talked to who don’t understand why I wasn’t okay with a just a quick fuck. I guess the world has just changed and I was left behind mentally with the older crowds traditions. Honestly,  it tears me apart to hear people say things like this. What is so wrong about wanting something real before you start growing wrinkles and forgetting what you did last Saturday?"

asheville,fiz3ssb,t1_fiz3emq,1582853475.0,"Thank you for your reply but I’m 25 and I’ve yet to have anything real. I feel like I’m getting too old. I see friends around me getting married and having kids (though sadly I know some of them are being cheated on), yet here I sit still alone. I can’t seem to find these women my friends do. Any recommendations on where I might look? Should I in all honestly just move somewhere else if that’s what I’m looking for?"
asheville,fiz2swy,t1_fiz2q61,1582852802.0,"Okay, I must ask: who are you so wise in the wisdom?"
asheville,fiz15h5,t1_fiz0khu,1582851677.0,"I’m assuming you don’t live in Asheville. Honest to God walking around like that might get me some attention but I’m not that kind of person. People around here aren’t really interested in let’s say “traditional” things. No I haven’t tried that, and no I will not.

As to the second, to me a date is a precursor to a potential relationship. Going on dates to find out the person is into polyamory or hookups or is actually currently sleeping with one of my friends on the side is a turn off for me. I know reddit is all about bashing other people that post stuff but I’m honestly just a guy who believes in a wholesome old fashioned values. It would be mind blowing to meet someone around here who is interested in being with just one person."

If both people are childless, they first work on themselves as couple, then the children come and it’s no longer about that intimacy. Perfectly normal with no kids prior, but you start seeing a woman with a child and you’re always gonna be put in the background. I honestly don’t see how with her raising a kid the couple could go through that intimate stage where the partner bonding occurs. On top of that, men (or at least me) have a certain pride about raising their own flesh and blood. Having a bastard, even if I came to love them, would always nag at me saying she’d been with and created another human with a completely different guy and now I’m raising HIS child. I dunno.

unpopularopinion,f8dkcfc,t1_f8dj6l8,1574495051.0,"A) Because catholicism has controlled the hearts of more people and for longer. B) I’m not sure what your argument for the rest is. Yeah, you’re right, most religions including the few you mentioned are zealous about keeping the moral law. Yes, they don’t account for human mental variables. When it persists too long the people call for an end or relaxation of religion or their particular religion. Eventually it happens usually through violent revolution. Fastfoward many years and what is generally considered sin by all the aforementioned religions (murder, sexual leniency, homosexuality, greed, etc) runs rampant and then many start calling for a reformation to “bring them back to God”. This has happened hundreds of times throughout history and a great many times with the catholics in particular which is why I chose them and it’s well documented that nihilism dominates the mind of these disillusioned ancestors same as it is for us today. While God’s around via religion, people are on a short leash but at least they have security in the afterlife.
   Why are we going off on this one little tangent that is only s fragment of my original argument? Like I said, morality is complex and the stability of civilization is also hinged on moral code. A city of murderers and thieves won’t be a city for long, with or without religion. Remove the boundaries and mental conditioning of religion, government and society (all man-made creations) and I do believe that humanity would regress into tribalistic territories."

However, I’ve noticed throughout history civilizations revolve between cycles of reformation, enlightenment and barbarism. It’s surely not the first time we’ve attacked the idea of god and destroyed our moral boundaries but history repeats itself and every time this has happened nations fell apart or became to weak to defend themselves because everyone lost their sense of morality. Catholic bishops openly hiring prostitutes, murder on the streets completely disregarded, etc. When this has happened in the past, catholicism always came back to reinforce the people’s original morality.

Now that Christianity is declining due to scientific successes, more people, especially of the younger generations are experiencing existential and moral nihilism. This idea of not knowing (without a god to tell us) of what’s right and wrong, how we should live, how we should treat each other, why we’re even here in the first place, what our purpose is and where we go when we die drops a huge weight (even if only subconsciously) on our shoulders. Without a god, what’s point in even existing? I’ve been depressed and anxious since I was a child, and I believe my agnostic/borderline atheism is a big part of that. Not just for me, for everybody.
