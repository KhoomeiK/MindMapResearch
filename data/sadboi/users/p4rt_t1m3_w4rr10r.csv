asheville,fiz7lpg,t1_fiz6382,1582856047.0,"Ayyyy, thanks for being a good sport man. Pretty rare on reddit. Cheers!"
asheville,fiz7e0a,t1_fiz5mo8,1582855905.0,"Here‚Äôs the best way I can explain it: when I was a child I was notorious for not socializing with people my age. Being 9 years old I was having complex conversations with people triple my age. And that trend has continued throughout my life. Hell, the first girl I fell in love with was 3 years older than me. I have always been more mature than my peers.

A) I have experienced far more than I care to admit on here, good and bad. You may be right about other people my age wanting to live wild and free but those days are already behind me. I have a car, a good paying job and my own place. I do really want kids and (in case you aren‚Äôt aware) any age past late 20s your chances of having children with disabilities increases exponentially. I refuse to risk having children when I‚Äôm older because honest to God that is a fucking cruel thing to do knowing that. My energy is spent; I‚Äôm not a partying 20 year old any more, I‚Äôm a grown ass adult.

B) You could label me as desperate as it seems fair. However I‚Äôm only desperate because everyone these days is hooked on drugs and loves mindless partying and sex. All I want is my significant other that I can lean on as I continue on through this journey and I can boost them too.

C) I‚Äôm sure being single would rock if you‚Äôve already been through a few solid relationships but as someone who doesn‚Äôt want to just have sex with strangers I do not find it quite so awesome.

I mean no offense towards you, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a wonderful person (hell, you took the time respond and I appreciate that) but this is the same type of spiel I‚Äôd heard from the girls I‚Äôve talked to who don‚Äôt understand why I wasn‚Äôt okay with a just a quick fuck. I guess the world has just changed and I was left behind mentally with the older crowds traditions. Honestly,  it tears me apart to hear people say things like this.

I see friends around me getting married and having kids (though sadly I know some of them are being cheated on), yet here I sit still alone. I can‚Äôt seem to find these women my friends do. Any recommendations on where I might look? Should I in all honestly just move somewhere else if that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for?"
asheville,fiz2swy,t1_fiz2q61,1582852802.0,"Okay, I must ask: who are you so wise in the wisdom?"
asheville,fiz15h5,t1_fiz0khu,1582851677.0,"I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt live in Asheville. Honest to God walking around like that might get me some attention but I‚Äôm not that kind of person. People around here aren‚Äôt really interested in let‚Äôs say ‚Äútraditional‚Äù things. No I haven‚Äôt tried that, and no I will not.

As to the second, to me a date is a precursor to a potential relationship. Going on dates to find out the person is into polyamory or hookups or is actually currently sleeping with one of my friends on the side is a turn off for me. I know reddit is all about bashing other people that post stuff but I‚Äôm honestly just a guy who believes in a wholesome old fashioned values. It would be mind blowing to meet someone around here who is interested in being with just one person."

Perfectly normal with no kids prior, but you start seeing a woman with a child and you‚Äôre always gonna be put in the background.

On top of that, men (or at least me) have a certain pride about raising their own flesh and blood.

unpopularopinion,f8dkcfc,t1_f8dj6l8,1574495051.0,"A) Because catholicism has controlled the hearts of more people and for longer. B) I‚Äôm not sure what your argument for the rest is. Yeah, you‚Äôre right, most religions including the few you mentioned are zealous about keeping the moral law. Yes, they don‚Äôt account for human mental variables. When it persists too long the people call for an end or relaxation of religion or their particular religion. Eventually it happens usually through violent revolution. Fastfoward many years and what is generally considered sin by all the aforementioned religions (murder, sexual leniency, homosexuality, greed, etc) runs rampant and then many start calling for a reformation to ‚Äúbring them back to God‚Äù. This has happened hundreds of times throughout history and a great many times with the catholics in particular which is why I chose them and it‚Äôs well documented that nihilism dominates the mind of these disillusioned ancestors same as it is for us today. While God‚Äôs around via religion, people are on a short leash but at least they have security in the afterlife.
   Why are we going off on this one little tangent that is only s fragment of my original argument? Like I said, morality is complex and the stability of civilization is also hinged on moral code. A city of murderers and thieves won‚Äôt be a city for long, with or without religion. Remove the boundaries and mental conditioning of religion, government and society (all man-made creations) and I do believe that humanity would regress into tribalistic territories."

Catholic bishops openly hiring prostitutes, murder on the streets completely disregarded, etc. When this has happened in the past, catholicism always came back to reinforce the people‚Äôs original morality.

This idea of not knowing (without a god to tell us) of what‚Äôs right and wrong, how we should live, how we should treat each other, why we‚Äôre even here in the first place, what our purpose is and where we go when we die drops a huge weight (even if only subconsciously) on our shoulders.
