BipolarReddit,fqn52il,t3_gjtev8,1589488806.0,"I‚Äôm going to speak bluntly back to you. 

I‚Äôm not suicidal because if I was suicidal I‚Äôd kill myself. It would be over. It‚Äôs not physically hard to kill, be it murder or suicide. If I wanted to die, I would. 

Instead, I‚Äôve realized that I am extremely depressed at times, resentful that I‚Äôm living at my darkest, and saying I‚Äôm suicidal is a burden to others and not the whole truth. I don‚Äôt want to be a burden to others. I don‚Äôt want others to worry about me. 

At times I wish I didn‚Äôt exist, but I am not suicidal.
