One of symptoms of BPD is substance abuse, I'm in AA for over 3 years but just over 5 months sober, stopping drinking and 12 step program helps.
Going back to my BPD, I know I have it, I booked an appointment with my doc to confirm but gave up on it, with my borderline I sometimes think I have it and sometimes opposite.
Question - should I think and be fully convinced all the time that I have BPD or what, because I just don't know."

So this morning I experienced extreme craving for smoke but it was little bit different. 

Being aware that my emotional reactions to situations are not necessary nicotine cravings gives me chance to identify the cause and recognize the fact that easy thing as deep breath and simply taking step back helps. I didn't smoke today."

stopsmoking,ese74yf,t3_c70ycu,1561885000.0,"So when it comes to depression and anxiety it is little bit different with smokers, we don't actually know what came first the *chicken or the egg.* My own personal experience shows that my depressive thoughts are reduced by let's say 95% since after 7th day of not smoking. I wouldn't write this stuff here if it wasn't for real, the problem was I was always in fear of facing life without cigarette, the fear had to be mastered first before I smoked my last cigarette. It is never perfect but I found that my emotions and sensations are not always or maybe never a *nicotine cravings.* 

Do you know the difference between **nicotine craving** and let's say **sugar/oxygen imbalance**, **anxeity attack, panic attack ?** Many times I was confused, can you tell what is a nicotine craving ? How does it manifest in you ?"

stopsmoking,es0ez0a,t3_c58w77,1561473712.0,"Hi, you are fantastic, intelligent and determined person, cigarette addiction is very tricky and it causes different reactions to every smoker.
You asked what helped, well I tried almost everything and I quit many times but couldn't stay stopped, the problem is that we are being told that smoking is nicotine addiction and in our society there is massive value put on word nicotine and this is bad. Real quit should start with reflection why we smoke, why we want to quit and what other mental health issues we may have. Try to recognise what is the difference between craving and anxiety or depressive emotions because maybe this is why you smoke.
You see when inhaling highly toxic and poisonous substance our body produces cocktail of endorphins and hormones to defend us and to survive we tricked our brains with smoke so it thinks problem is solved just for short period of time.
Stay strong, support is important and is hard to quit on your own."
