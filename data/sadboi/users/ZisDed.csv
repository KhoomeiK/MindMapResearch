Being anxious and self critical can be a huge advantage at times; it gives you the ability to reflect and evaluate how you have done something in a way more self assured individuals naturally don't. 

I had a task to prioritise characteristics which make a good teacher. I told the interviewer that I had changed my mind about the order I had put them in, during the interview. He said this showed my ability to to be reflective and improve my own thinking.

Don't feel like you have to be perfect in the interview. Like others have said, it's about potential. If you are a nervous or unconfident person, you will still be a great role model to some children, and that's important."

VS Is a poorly understood symptom of another condition or conditions. Unfortunately we are waiting for more research into the cause.

The most useful thing a doctor can do for you is put on file that you have symptoms which are real, so that you can have them for reference.
