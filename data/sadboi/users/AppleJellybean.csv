Comments said the cake was too sweet. I only added 3/4 cups of white sugar.

I also added an entire teabag of earl grey tea into the cake batter, closer to one tablespoon.

Instead of the Earl grey syrup, i mixed equal parts sweetened condensed milk and whole milk. Using a brush, I deliberately soaked the cakes

The layers + topping is a whipped cream frosting. I added one teaspoon of earl grey tea https://www.food.com/recipe/whipped-cream-frosting-39013

askwomenadvice,fm3plbw,t3_fstkui,1585732210.0,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with not having sex at 20, 21, 30, 40, whatever age.

What matters is that you do it when you‚Äôre ready, when you‚Äôre comfortable. What matters most is that there is consent from all parties. 

What counts as sex anyway? the line is so blurred. Does sex only count if it‚Äôs PIV? what about non-hetero intimate relationships? how about oral?

I used to feel the same way. I just turned 21 and I have considered multiple times throughout college to sleep with a guy because he was offering but I couldn‚Äôt make myself do it. I even made my ex-boyfriend wait until i was comfortable. And I don‚Äôt regret it. I had a guy ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù (we weren‚Äôt even exclusive) with me when I was 18 because I told him I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with hooking up with him after going on one date. I sure as hell don‚Äôt regret it to this day. I said the same thing to my first boyfriend and he immediately got off me and told me I was beautiful. It made me feel butterflies and made me want to jump him more than ever.

I absolutely hate the label ‚Äúvirgin‚Äù. I feel like it has a negative connotation associated with it, and makes people feel bad for not experiencing what they would define as ‚Äúsex‚Äù, and pressures people into doing something they may not be ready for. My opinion - it glorifies sex. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, sex is great but it shouldn‚Äôt be determining someones entire identity/value.

My advice - Accept that you are someone who needs to build comfort before you can engage in sex, and learn that you have more value as a person than just someone to have sex with. 
Know that your sexual history does not define who you are as a person. It‚Äôs a miniscule part of the bigger picture. It‚Äôs literally just an activity people do. 

As much as society blows it up - it **really** isn‚Äôt a big deal. And it‚Äôs so much better when you do it when you‚Äôre with a partner you‚Äôre comfortable with and consenting. 

Self-love is so underrated. Feeling horny without a partner doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt get off. If you haven‚Äôt explored your own body yet, I recommend learning what you like. Explore your body, learn how to make yourself orgasm. It‚Äôll be empowering to know that you don‚Äôt need a partner to get yourself off, and when you do finally decide to have sex you‚Äôll know what you need - it‚Äôll be less awkward, less fumbling and more enjoyable for both parties

As for that guy needless to say he sounds insecure as fuck. You do you !"

If you ever need resources/someone to talk to I recommend checking out your local crisis centre. You can call in anonymously."
mentalhealth,fm08gdc,t1_flyroji,1585648826.0,"This breaks my heart. I‚Äôm not sure what city you live in but speaking on behalf of someone that works at a Canadian Crisis centre that is accredited by the American Association of Suicidology, we will NEVER hang up on a a caller. Only when we are being verbally threatened or abused, and even then we will state the reason why we are disengaging. Definitely not because someone is asking if they were calling the suicide hotline. 

I am heartbroken this happened during a time when you felt unsafe, and glad that you weren‚Äôt left alone and was thankfully supported by your wife. Please, please report this incident to your local crisis centre about this incident. There should be a public business phone number/e-mail online. If you remember the date and time they could also most likely pinpoint the volunteer that answered your call, as we document everything.

They should have answered, especially the second time you called. My guess is negligence on the volunteer‚Äôs part, which could have resulted in a life being taken that day. Thankfully that was not the case. Please report this. Negligence should never be the reason why somebody who needs help ends up losing their life."
mentalhealth,fly0frz,t3_frs1lc,1585593251.0,"Hey there! I‚Äôm a fellow volunteer suicide hotline responder. I am so sorry that you did not get the help you needed in that frightening time when you really needed someone to be there with you. 

It really sounds like you felt dismissed by her response. Please know that 90% of the time, people working at the crisis/mental health/suicide lines are not mental health professionals. They are volunteers who have undergone hundreds of hours of crisis training. This does not make us mental health professionals. Sometimes there are licensed counselors volunteering there as well, but they are provided the exact same training. They are told to forget their own counselling training and to follow crisis guidelines because we are a **short term service**. Counselors create a **long term relationship** with you, crisis call centres do not.

We are trained to stop engaging in verbally abusive calls as it is a misuse of our service. Repeated offenders become blocked and banned from calling us.
It is likely that Rachel did not understand that it was a tic, even if it was clear to you, because it‚Äôs likely that she **is not a mental health professional** and is **not aware** of what tourette symdrome is. Next time if you decide to call a line, which I encourage you to do, please immediately start the call with a warning that you have tourettes and you cannot control tics that may be misinterpreted as verbal abuse so that you don‚Äôt get disengaged with the line!

That being said, it is understandable from your perspective why you would feel misunderstood. Feelings of psychosis during a time like this is incredibly frightening, and you needed some one to be there for you. 

Please don‚Äôt let this experience stop you from reaching out for help from lines! We genuinely want to be there to listen and support you the best way we can. **You weren‚Äôt dismissed for having tourettes and being a man. You were dismissed because Rachel misunderstood a tic as verbal abuse.**"

Breaking up is like recovering from an addiction. All those memories of her company, especially the most intimate moments (which has the strongest feelings attached) is your brain trying to get that dopamine fix again. 

It is really hard. What made is easier for me was treating it like an addiction. Accepting that I am just adjusting to a new routine without my daily dopamine fix. Focusing on recovering, working on myself, staying busy. Trust me as someone who is also 2 months into NC: one day you‚Äôll wake up and you just don‚Äôt care anymore.

Perhaps the purpose is to try and soften the blow? for you? for them?

I don‚Äôt doubt that they didn‚Äôt truly love you. But just know that love wasn‚Äôt enough for them to stick by you. They have made their decision. Even if they truly loved you, truly believed you were perfect for each other, for whatever reason they still believed the best choice was to let you go. 

The right person WILL come along and feel all those same things. But it will also be shown in their actions. They won‚Äôt let you go.

Head up. Actions speak louder than words. Don‚Äôt be swayed by just sweet words. Stay strong."

dating_advice,fj2m856,t3_fawg9i,1582947339.0,"Closure is something you give yourself. Ask yourself WHY you want to say these words to her. What is the need you‚Äôre fulfilling by doing this? Do you hope she‚Äôll magically turn around and think she made a mistake and want to get back together? It‚Äôs tough. I‚Äôve been on this side before. But you have to know that sometimes, them choosing not to be with you is knowing enough. That is your closure. 

You‚Äôre probably having a hard time moving on because you believe this relationship could be salvaged if you had the chance to communicate. Especially since it ended so abruptly. A relationship cannot be one sided, she already communicated that she doesn‚Äôt want to work it out from her actions. I say this from my own experience. Over time you‚Äôll see that actions really do speak more than words.

I hope you surround yourself with self love, friends, and family. Allow yourself to grieve the loss of a relationship and give yourself the love you once gave to your ex."

dating_advice,fidfjbt,t3_f7phrl,1582366444.0,"Addressing the initiating a move part - if you‚Äôre not comfortable with being forward and asking if you can give your date a kiss, a slower method could be seeing how she reacts with going on more dates. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty safe to lean in slowly (see if she also comes in closer) for a kiss by the third-ish date. Every situation is different though. My ex didn‚Äôt kiss me until 1.5 months later, and we ended up dating for a short while. I kept seeing him cause I knew we both liked each other and he was really shy & needed time to come out of his shell.

Also, I really hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as rude but from your post it sounds like you want to be in a relationship because you‚Äôre lonely - which I‚Äôve also experienced before. It‚Äôs human nature to want companionship but please make sure you‚Äôre going into a relationship for all the right reasons - not to just fill a void. That‚Äôs going to set you up with a relationship of unhealthy co-dependency and a heavy burden on your future partner.

You‚Äôre so young. And from what you said, attractive. Perhaps a shift in perspective might help? instead of dating to get into a serious relationship, maybe think of it as more just putting yourself out there and seeing whats out there. Take this time to learn about yourself. Learn how to be single and have fun doing it. Cause no one is going to be able to fill that void in the long run except yourself. People may come and go but you‚Äôll always have yourself.

You‚Äôre young, attractive, go fuck around (with consent), meet people!"
AskMen,fid6t46,t3_f7f03b,1582363369.0,"Easier said than done, but if you‚Äôre interested in somebody you gotta shoot your shot - that‚Äôs how you‚Äôll get dates. Nothing wrong with starting off with a platonic interaction in the beginning - you can take small risks (body language/physical touch such as touching her arm, etc.) and see how she reacts. If she isn‚Äôt visibly retracting, consider shooting your shot - it can be as simple as ‚ÄúI‚Äôd really like to get to know you better! Are you up for (generic first date activity) sometime?‚Äù - super safe, doesn‚Äôt come off as aggressive IMO, and most of the time the answer will either be 1. sure! or 2. I can‚Äôt because _______ (which almost is never directed at you). 
Pretty much every date I‚Äôve gone on the guy was super honest about his feelings and his intentions which I really liked because I didn‚Äôt have to play any guessing games! and I also did the same with a few guys and so far they all gave me a chance. Even if it ended after one date.

Rejection might happen but the more you put yourself out there the easier it gets! it‚Äôs nerve racking for sure but at the end of the day you‚Äôll (almost) always feel better about putting yourself out there :-) good luck !

dating_advice,fgy83ce,t3_f0sxqg,1581180480.0,"He might be shy tbh. My ex was really shy, when we first started seeing each other he stayed over and slept with me on the same bed and didn‚Äôt kiss me or make more of a move besides hold me. It took him 1.5 months of dating to kiss me. I could have kissed him but I am also a bit shy. Turned out he was horny as hell. Shy guys are sly.

If you know he likes you back you could wait for him to build up the confidence to kiss you. You might be waiting awhile. Or you could make it easier on him and just kiss him. The guys don‚Äôt always have to kiss first :-)"
dating_advice,fgsyrv8,t3_f0b0cs,1581095457.0,"Be clear with your boundaries. If he does try to make a move you should communicate if you‚Äôre uncomfortable and you only want to do it when you‚Äôre exclusive/married/whatever your boundary is. Never be scared or ashamed with communicating your own personal boundary. If he doesn‚Äôt respect it you probably don‚Äôt want to be dating him anyway.

There‚Äôs unfortunately no way you can guarantee knowing what someone‚Äôs true intentions are, but from my experience if the guy is genuinely interested in you and not just wanting sex, he‚Äôll respect your boundary and stick around until you are comfortable.

Keep in mind every situation is different and a really shitty situation would be he tries to make things different to meet your boundary in order to sleep with you (ex. asks to make things official then asks for sex right away) and then could possibly ditch you after which would possibly make you feel ‚Äúused‚Äù.

Trust your gut and look at the big picture. If you feel like he genuinely likes you for you, then chances are he does. If you‚Äôre feeling used, chances are he probably is using you.
