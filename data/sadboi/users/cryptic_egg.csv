You can have 0/10 humor and a meh personality but if you're hot it's 'endearing' and you're always funny and cool. Same traits coupled with ugliness are seen as a boring or creepy personality.

People are shallow and only care about looks and social circles. Most laughing is only going to be for validation from someone you think is hot or cool anyway. Females especially will stare with disgust if you dare speak when you're not a 9+/10 chad. Putting in effort here is pointless, if you've got a bad face nobody cares."
ForeverAlone,flk42fq,t1_flk23zj,1585233489.0,"Putting aside that some guys can make up for their looks with personality, many people see dating as a part of life rather than just a thing you sometimes get. People will settle (as I said before) for relationships that meet maybe 50% of their needs with people that aren't that attractive or likable if it means having a relationship in their life.

Society naturally favors chads and the females that drool over them. People with below 6 looks and difficult personalities are doomed to be lonely or forced to settle with a meh relationship just for the social validation it brings. getting anything meaningful is impossible.

If you are cursed with bad looks and a boring personality, the best you'll ever get is forced validation after perusing an uninteresting female for months, probably wasting lots of money and effort in the process."
ForeverAlone,fljrm10,t1_fljqwtu,1585224396.0,"You're missing the elephant in the room; some people are plain ugly and unlikable. If people with difficult personalities could just develop new personalities nobody would every have problems with socializing. You can't just get traits people will like. Your personality is a combination of genetics and random factors that influence you through your life. You get very little say in who you are and developing an authentic fun personality from a totally unlikable one is near impossible.

As for looks, you have them or you don't assuming you're in good physical shape, females are shallow and want a nice face and good body shape. If you don't have those, no luck.

Working to give things to females can get their affection, but if you don't have other attractive traits you just become a simp. There is no point in slaving away to buy a female's happiness when realistically she'll end up fixing her attention on chads who don't put in effort anyway."
ForeverAlone,fljr2jj,t1_fljq7an,1585223875.0,"The fact that they even get in a situation where they can talk long enough for it to be considered flirting without looking creepy means they've won the genetic lottery and aren't ugly or socially inept. You're describing average people having an average success rate. Of course a normal person will have plenty of times where they feel attraction to someone but nothing develops from it, but the important part is they actually do get the chance to interact with people long enough to try.

Those of us that are unable to act well in social situations and aren't attractive are hopeless. You may have 100 conversations where only 1 gets somewhere, but some of us won't even get 1 real conversation because our natural disadvantages are knocking us down before we've even tried.

Even if we did keep trying, we'd be nothing more than simps shooting endless shots with women we have no chance with. It's pointless."
ForeverAlone,fljqa09,t1_fljps6k,1585223094.0,"There was nothing wrong with that guy. He was very shy which made it hard for him to meet girls as he wasn't putting himself out there. There's a difference between shy and awkward, although people use them interchangeably. When I say awkward I mean regularly creating uncomfortable social situations due to an inability to act and react in a way most people do.

Ultimately the woman was attracted to him physically and emotionally because he looked and acted like enough of a normal person to get a relationship. Some of us can't even get that far."
ForeverAlone,fljo3iy,t1_fljnnmi,1585220755.0,"The fact that there weren't any relationship-ending issues with you is a genetic win on your part.

ForeverAlone,fljnp0l,t1_fliwi29,1585220306.0,"What you're missing is that those things are part of normal life for most people. Flirting isn't something we generally try to do. Most guys will be around a girl randomly, and during normal conversation will just subtly try to get a little closer with her because they like her. It may be a little awkward, but it's not a huge effort. If you're not being a total recluse and your casual efforts are met with no success, it's genetics."
ForeverAlone,fljnj8a,t1_fljfsyj,1585220125.0,"I made a small edit to clarify this since it was vague. I'm talking with the assumption that you are living a 'normal' life where you meet new people as part of other things you do, such as work, clubs or groups you spend time with. That's what most normal people consider the effort to be. Once you're out in public and in a situation where people are meeting new people, if none of those interactions go well you're probably genetically doomed.

Of course being an obese shut-in isn't going to get you anywhere, but many FAs aren't that kind of person. They've lived life in a pretty typical way and are only unsuccessful because they're ugly or have natural social issues."
ForeverAlone,fljn71s,t1_flip26g,1585219736.0,"That's the best way I could put it. People just coincidentally meet through some event, and coincidentally get along well, and coincidentally spend more time together which suddenly creates a relationship.

SuicideWatch,fjxzf6i,t3_ffcy1q,1583686773.0,"From my experience (although I've not made multiple serious attempts), this is the result of people not knowing what to do or say. People quickly get tired of you for being suicidal, not because they're intolerant, but because they feel like any time they invest won't fix or help the problem. It really does hurt seeing how your mental state exhausts people around you, but at the same time, what more can we expect of them? Even though in an ideal world people would just be there to listen, which helps, just having to acknowledge your mental state can get tiring for people fast, and people quickly take the attitude of ""either fix yourself or stop complaining to others.""

Unfortunately I don't have a solid solution. I personally try to just not mention it to others too often, but if it reaches a point where you struggle to live normal life due to how you feel, it can be hard to hide."

You need to give yourself time to properly process this. It will be hard, but given time you can learn to live with it. When someone who you saw as part of your life leaves, it is going to be difficult to imagine continued living without them. You'll probably miss simple routines that used to involve them as well as bigger things. The important thing here is that you need to give yourself a chance to adjust your view on your own life, which no longer includes that person.

As for right now, try to take steps to make sure that you're safe. It will help to talk to others as much as possible so that you don't obsess too much over your own negative thoughts. Try to make sure someone knows how you feel so you can get some support in the short term. If nobody like that is there for you, talking on positive online communities can be the next best thing.

Since they don't seem like problems that will go away, I'm pretty happy to say I'm FA, even though I'm just approaching 18.

You let it get to a point where the girl is convinced that you're not making any moves, and establish yourself as a good long-term friend. of course that isn't going to make a relationship, it's a different dynamic. The fact that you were continuously talking for a year with no real attempt at romantic progression was the problem here.

In future I think you'd benefit from being a little more assertive about the kind of relationship you actually want. Yes this means the friendship might not work if the girl isn't interested, but it also means that if she is open to you you might actually get somewhere.

Your personality is something that exists between you and other people, so unless you already have good social circles, developing it is hard. You can't just decide to be a fun person.

The only easy time in your life to start with social circles is when you're young, when the dynamic between people really is random strangers talking to each other other.

In what world is that realistic? If I was having a shitty sex life because of my partner and couldn't fix it I would probably leave too (though I'm the likely cause of bad sex in reality).
