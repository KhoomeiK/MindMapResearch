There are some songs that need some lyrics to understand though.

I'm going to predict that many will give negative feedback to the album since Idol already molded the viewer's of seeing him as a solo act (meaning acoustic or unplugged). It's like giving a different product to the customers.

As for me, I love the album. I love hard music and wasn't really into Idol since he came along. I just wish he had re-recorded Out Loud."
