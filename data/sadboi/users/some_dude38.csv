I know it is quarantine time and all, but some people are intense man. One example

I was delivering food and the instruction on the app said ring the bell. So I approach the door and ring the bell.

Noting happens for a few seconds, and then a loud female voice abruply  startles me out of nowhere ""put it on top of the mailbox!"". I almost dropped the food. No idea where that voice came from

I was really startled so somehow I didn't catch the ""mailbox"" part, so I just placed the food by the door like 99.9% of all deliveries and start making my way to my car.

""I said, on top of the mailbox!!!"" repeats the lady super loud and angry. Honest to god I still have no idea where that voice is coming from. She is either somewhere behind the door or behind the plants. I walk back, put the food on top of the mailbox and at this point I am darting to my car. I want no part of crazy invisible lady

Then I hear a faint  ""thanks very much..."".  I am honestly just pacing to my car thinking ""... just don't call the cops on me"". That's just where my head went, sorry. Then I hear a loud and angry ""You are welcome!!!!!!!!"" ... I guess I was supposed to say ""you are welcome"" . When I am nervous, my brain shuts down
