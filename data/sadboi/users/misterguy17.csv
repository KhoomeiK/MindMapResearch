depression,f0uln33,t3_d6dxpl,1568944032.0,"Hey , currently in a very happy and loving relationship, I am also diagnosed depression and anxiety. It’s hard but if you make it clear to your partner what you’re going through and what you have to deal with day to day, they will understand. If they don’t fuck em. They don’t deserve you. One key thing that’s always helped me when times get tough with my girlfriend is to know boundaries. I’ve gotten into fights with my girlfriend and it really can be heartbreaking some of the things that go through my head in the aftermath. What makes me feel better though is calling her up, and talking like normal people and discuss what happened . Communication is the most important in a relationship."
