bipolar,fihkj4u,t3_f7uudl,1582411408.0,"Know that we have a complexity to our minds that many others don't. 

Refuse to be a slave to it.

Learn all you can. Read. Listen. Books! Take in all you can about managing the condition.

The waves don't stop. We just get better at surfing them.  Even the biggest of tsunamis, we can survive and not drown. 

I know full well that this sounds easier said than done but if we don't stock our mental wellness toolbox with the right tools, we cannot expect to fix the problems when they arrive... and they will arrive.

Respect, kindness and love to you!"

Thanks the Grandfather who drank himself to death. Thanks the Grandma who popped her head in an oven.

bipolar,eug1fdr,t1_eug19rj,1563797626.0,Try resting. Just start by finding yourself a comfy spot somewhere quiet and take some deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth.  Rest your eyes if you need to.  Look after yourself :)
bipolar,eug02p8,t1_eufzzzq,1563796494.0,"I should add... anything you can do to get regular good nights sleep is good for your wellbeing.  I know it's tough sometimes but if you can get regular decent nights rest, you'll be better for it."
bipolar,eufzzzq,t3_cgbys1,1563796430.0,"Depending on your dose, you may get drowsy.  I take it at night to help with sleeping.  I don't recommend trying to stay awake after having taken them... you may just eat yourself out of house and home."
bipolar,etkzzhf,t1_etkzx7f,1562915056.0,It's missing the waves. ðŸ˜‚
bipolar,etkzx7f,t3_cc5nr1,1562914981.0,Wow. I can relate. That's a pretty good depiction.
bipolar,es2q1a4,t3_by8g73,1561534403.0,My next concept has been determined.  Artist asked & loves the idea. Looking forward to the next one :)  26th September.  Watch this space.
bipolar,eqtrmxg,t1_eqsxjg1,1560317938.0,"I've started doing the very same. Started with Facebook. Deleted account. I feel compelled sometimes to help people through sharing my own experiences. I know life can be excruciating at times. There's a way through it... even for the most tragic of us. It's hard to manage oversharing when you're in that state of hypomania. I feel everything so fucking intensely. Anyway. Woffling on probably just emphasized it even more. 
Trying to say less is easier um... said than done."
bipolar,eqk5xf8,t3_bykx67,1560116659.0,Thank you.
bipolar,eqgqrwx,t1_eqgqdp4,1560040935.0,Someone did ;)  That someone was me.

bipolar,eqggkg1,t1_eqfy1xy,1560036056.0,It was made for me. It was conceptulised by me and realised through an incredible artist.
bipolar,eqerdnt,t1_eqeqyd5,1560008387.0,Thanks. This has been a labour of love.  The concept... design... updates... and finally ink.  Finding the right artist was key.
bipolar,eqeleh4,t1_eqeks64,1560005654.0,"I am quite fond of it, too.  It's mine.

Credit where credit is due. The artist is a visionary. He was able to put my concept, the story, the meaning behind it all... the planning... design and ink."
