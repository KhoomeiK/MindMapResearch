Stop feeling sorry for yourself. You keep rambling about judgment but its a self fulfilling prophecy at this point.  The more you tell people to stop judging you,  they are forced to because your toxic personality and self pity makes people look at you more. That's what you want though. You want attention.

Just like you i felt bad for having suicidal thoughts and being depressed because i was told that i didn't have a reason to be depressed and that there are people who have it worse than me. Well off i went to a psych hospital for teens. Friendly people and no judgements so i felt somewhat comfortable. They had a lot of group sessions where the kids would sort of lead the session. I shared my story and got more and more comfortable until i was leading the sessions more frequently. One day we get a guy who is no stranger to the hospital. Dude had about 6 attempts under his belt including this latest one. He had his wrists bandaged heavily, but acted like nothing even happened.  He wasn't distressed because for him this was just normal.  A continuation of the cycle of suicide attempt, go to psych ward,  try it again. Well I asked him why he tried to kill himself and he looked at me with almost sad unknowing eyes and just said ""i don't know. "" So me and the other kids asked him a bunch of questions like about his life. He had great parents who were always there for him. He had a gf and was pretty popular in school.  He was also a track and field star at his high school. I was shook. This dude had a pretty good life,  and yet he just wanted to fucking die and had no clue why. I learned a huge lesson that day. We don't need a reason to be depressed. Depression is a disease that we cannot make sense of or control. If you are feeling the way you are feeling you dont need to try to validate it.
