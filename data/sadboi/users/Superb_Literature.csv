Alright, I'm gettin' tired of your shit
You don't never buy me nothin'
See every time you come around
You got to bring Jim, James, Paul, and Tyrone
See why can't we be by ourselves, sometimes
See I've been having this on my mind for a long time
I just want it to be, you and me, like It used to be, Baby
But ya don't know how to act
So matter of fact, I think ya better call Tyrone (call him)
And Tell him come on, help you get your shit (come on, come on, come on)
You need to call Tyrone (call him)
And tell him I said come on‚Äù"
