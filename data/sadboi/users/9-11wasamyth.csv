offmychest,fqls5l9,t1_fqh3fsa,1589465041.0,The post wasn't about honesty it was about thinking before you say anything. What good does it do to call someone fat or ugly if they are only just singing or playing music.

raisedbynarcissists,fmjzcsz,t3_fvopln,1586140881.0,"The best thing is that you are aware of it. That way you can consciously make the decision to NOT act like her. I have been doing this for over ten years. Now that I am older and have so much other stuff to do I tend to loose my thoughts. I have my fianc√© tell me if I seem to be irrational that way i can take a step back, take a breath, and really think through the person I want to be."

That's when she started using the ""my house my rules obey or get out"" so I moved out first chance I got."

I realize that it's dangerous but I'm just trying to get through this because I do still have to work through this and my job is fairly complicated meaning I need to be able to think and not sick with migraines!!! 

I've tried walking outside, working out but nothing seems to work every app I open, every website I open, every conversation I start ..... I just want to relax."

Anxiety,fk4uyq6,t1_fk3vday,1583868103.0,"I can't tell you how many times I've done that 

One time I went to a fancy mall with my grandma and brother and I started to have an anxiety attack that quickly turned to a migraine as soon as we got seated I had to run to the bathroom and I was dry heaving but not actually throwing up. 

After that I was a mess. Shaking, terrified, embarrassed. And my mom kept telling me to stop being a baby."

ShitNsSay,fj1ntet,t1_fj1h8mp,1582923934.0,I developed a fun game to deal with it where I wouldn't eat at all. My mom thought it was AWESOME. I told her everyday I didn't feel well and the first night I went and laid on the couch my brother said come and eat -because he was concerned- her response shush she can stand to miss a couple meals
ShitNsSay,fiywq3l,t1_fiyvqy9,1582848707.0,"Thank you for the advice. I think I actually used this technique without realizing coming out of my teenage years. I first became aware of it because she is all I would talk about in my therapy sessions. I went to the therapist about a year and then unfortunately couldn't afford to go there anymore but my therapist help me realize that it wasn't me that was bad. So I started to hide my emotions. To this day I try my hardest not to cry, or show any weakness when I'm around her even though my now fianc√© knows I'm freaking out inside.

Edit: spelling errors"

insaneparents,fiuiw7r,t3_f9xqw8,1582742252.0,"!explanation 

I have social anxiety and I was going to talk to her over the phone but I'm better at the written word. I was too busy that week to practice a speech to her. We had gone on a trip it was the first time my bf was actually meeting my entire family. He was nervous and I wasn't watching how much alcohol was in our glasses. After we got so drunk to the point where we needed help to walk. She said let's play truth or dare. My grandmother even asked her if we had to play this and she kept on. We were too drunk to get up by ourselves so we couldn't leave. 

We may have been drunk but we remembered everything she asked him about religion (which is a touchy topic granted by family is very religious and I am not), his family, his intentions, whether he was going to marry me....

I sent the text about a couple days after this happened. 
The reason it looks like it's in an Excel sheet is because it is. I tend to block out things that upset me so it's gotten to the point where I need to have a journal of everything so I can remember it when I need to."
tifu,fiskk8e,t3_f9fmd2,1582686629.0,"I think it's kinda rediculous that your parents took one line at the end of the song to mean that you were coming out as trans. If I were you I'd be hurt. They think you're a ton boy because you are trans not because you are just not into all the girly crap. 

That's the only way I can see a parent jumping to that conclusion. Any person I know would conclude that he sings ""I'm a man..."" Because the singer is male....

Edit: imo you didn't fuck up here. The parents jumping to conclusions did. Besides what they say shouldn't matter. If your trans be proud. Who TF cares what others think?"
