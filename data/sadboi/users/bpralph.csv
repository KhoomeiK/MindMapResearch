I'd recommend learning how to use bullet journals for actual planning and organizing.  There are plenty of good youtube tutorials.  They're great for disorganized minds, have a flexible format, and you carry them around.

I used to think my depression, social anxiety, social isolation, ADHD symptoms, etc, were varied complex psychological issues.  The stimulant helps with all of these mood/personality disorders.  Maybe they're all rooted in ADHD.  Amazing.

Good luck."
ChronicPain,fdhow6m,t3_elfzj9,1578427215.0,"I've had similar experience with a fissure that was a problem for years.  Eventually healed it through achieving small soft bowel movements consistently.  A low or zero-fiber diet may help reduce size and frequency of bowel movements, but be sure to prevent hard stools with magnesium oxide or something.  Restoralax/Miralax is a great mild stool softener but is not appropriate for chronic use.  Magnesium oxide is better for long term use, and cheaper.

There are prescription ointments that can help with pain as well as relaxing the muscles.  Hot baths may help.  

If it's a fissure, a botox injection can help with healing if the above methods don't work.  Surgery is available as a last resort but there are risks."
depression,fdh6g68,t1_fdh2xoq,1578416395.0,"You want to avoid sugar and even complex carbs as they start breaking down to sugar immediately in the mouth.  It's best not to snack on these foods often, not get them stuck in your teeth, and brush or even just rinse or swish some water in your mouth after these meals.

The mouth is pretty good at keeping itself clean and healthy without brushing and flossing if you're not eating sugar and carbs all day.  Hunter gatherer humans had pretty good dental health with rudimentary hygiene practices due to good diets and low meal frequency.

Edit:  Dont eat spinach often.  It's extremely high in oxalate.  Broccoli and kale are better."

Since getting diagnosed with ADHD and starting Dextroamphetamine, I now last quite a bit longer than before.  It's a very welcome side effect that pretty much restored my sexual function back to normal.  Drugs have different sexual effects for different people, so if your ADHD meds have negative side effects, maybe try another.  If you're not on any drugs at all, maybe ask your doctor about dextroamphetamine or others."

As far as the software being able to recognize the fault, I'm sure there's no shortage of sensors, like accelerometers, that could help determine if the current timer value is within a reasonable range."

antinatalism,fb8nwkk,t1_fb8ga98,1576617966.0,"That was from a 2003 study (Davis).  Here's a more recent study that talks about that study and others:

[Field Deaths in Plant Agriculture](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1007/s10806-018-9733-8)

I haven't read all the studies, and there is a lack of data, but IMHO, if you're going to eat animals, grass-fed pastured beef is probably among the best.  You're only going to be eating one animal every few years and if the animals are treated well, it's arguably not unethical.  Definitely avoid factory-farmed chicken and pork.

Veggies grown in greenhouses, and plants grown personally in gardens are probably not bad for animal welfare.  Grains, legumes and seed oils (and the livestock that eat them) are probably pretty bad for animal welfare."

If a man tells me he's in pain, I assume he's probably in more pain than he's letting on, and I might take his claims more seriously than if a woman tells me the same.  I'm not saying it's right to do this, but I believe this may be the reason why there's this prejudice against women by doctors in regards to the treatment of pain."

In fact, since you have diagnoses, he probably is right.  Getting to a healthier weight is a low cost treatment with virtually no risk of negative side effects, and will improve your health even if it doesn't help with the pain, so it's reasonable that your doctor sees this as the best first course of treatment.  You're lucky to have diagnoses and a treatment path that is likely to improve your pain issues.  You owe it to yourself to lose the weight."
ChronicPain,f9sswkh,t1_f9sqqzj,1575599772.0,"One thing that can cause gout and arthritis symptoms is oxalosis, which is where calcium oxalate crystals get deposited around the body, especially in joints.  The symptoms of urate crystal gout and calcium oxalate crystal gout are basically identical.  Calcium oxalate is the same compound that forms kidney stones.

Some fruits, nuts, vegetables, and grains are very high in oxalate, and eating a lot of these foods can contribute to oxalosis and hyperoxaluria (high levels of oxalate in the urine).  Some oxalate is also produced by the body as a waste product, and some people have conditions where this causes hyperoxaluria.  I would recommend asking your doctor about getting a 24-hour urine oxalate test, along with standard kidney function tests.  If you have normal urine oxalate levels and normal kidney function, oxalosis is probably not the issue.  Go to your doctor appointment armed with some information, as in my experience most GP's are not that familiar with oxalate issues.

Foods high in oxalate include potatoes, chocolate, almost all nuts, bran, some vegetables, and some berries.  Foods with extremely high oxalate content include spinach, swiss chard, and rhubarb.  The more of these foods that are in your diet, the higher the chance of oxalate issues.  If you do indeed have oxalate issues, replacing these foods with meat, eggs, fish, white rice, low oxalate fruits & veggies (broccoli, peas, blueberries) will help.  (Edit: Tea is also high in oxalate)  Your symptoms may get temporarily worse while detoxing, especially if you do it abruptly.

FWIW, I had hyperoxaluria recently, as confirmed by urine oxalate tests, and also gout symptoms in my ankle and toe.  After lowering my oxalate levels, the symptoms disappeared.  If you do decide to try this treatment route, feel free to PM me.  I have a lot of knowledge and resources on this subject.  I'm not a doctor though, so I suggest you consult one to discuss treatment."
