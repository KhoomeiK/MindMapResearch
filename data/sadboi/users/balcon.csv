The delivery driver is aware of the uneven power dynamic that the man in green's shirt has over him. He makes a remark about it. And there's a fourth person outside of the frame that the man in green tells to ""call 911"".

It's the ones that have stuff for kids to do -- Ted's Montana Grill comes to mind with its pipe cleaners and crayons -- that tend to attract families, imho.

On edit: maybe the key is to make the restaurant ultra boring for kids... no coloring sheets or kids menu. That way, they won't want to accompany their parents there after one visit. They'll pull them to McDonalds or places with something fun to do instead."

Advice,fq9yxrh,t3_gh8ufw,1589209754.0,"Who to invite to a wedding and who to not seems to be a common issue with weddings. Someone is bound to feel left out or offended.

Here’s the thing: you do not owe anyone an explanation. Someone is either invited or they are not. You are inviting your parents and not your brother. This will not be the first time that a sibling has not been invited. Your parents are adults and can decide for themselves about whether to come or not, and if they do come, find temporary care for your brother. How they figure this out is none of your business.

You believe that your brother’s behavior will be toxic to the environment in which you wish to create. Because he has special needs does not matter. Just as a raging alcoholic would be disruptive in a reception and so you don’t invite him or her, either. Personally, I wouldn’t want a crying baby at my wedding, though it’s not the baby’s fault that he cries.

In short, invite your parents. Tell them your brother is not invited. And let them figure out what to do. You can not control them or their behavior or moderate their feelings. They may not come. They may throw a fit and guilt trip you. Or they may surprise you and find care for your brother on their own. Just be up front about it and not try to manipulate their emotions just so you don’t feel bad."

Advice,fq3dqf3,t3_gge7uc,1589065437.0,"It’s challenging to recommend how to change when you already have a prevailing idea of what normal people do. The thing is, normal is a relative term. Normal is in the eye of the beholder. There are norms in business and other spheres of life that can make you fit in with a group that is governed by norms, expectations and social mores. Bowling leagues and churches have their own norms.

What would “not boring” look like for you? How would you know that you have overcome boring?

Does it mean you get invited to more group events? Or perhaps it could mean that you are active on different social networks? You have to figure this out for yourself. Maybe it could be finding like-minded people that share your background or interests. 

As for your op, the majority of people don’t subscribe to Netflix or watch Tik Tok videos. That doesn’t make them abnormal or boring, it just means their interests lie elsewhere. You have skills and talents that make you unique. There are others who would find those things interesting."
