[Wayback Machine, helpful as always, didn't archive the flash.](https://web.archive.org/web/20120713065413/http://www.bethsoft.com/jpn/fo/fo_quest/) But if you were just searching for the ""enable flash"" screen archived here, today is your lucky day! /s

I really hope somebody has archived this.

EDIT: Looks like [someone nearly found it](http://swfchan.com/43/214277/?fonv_quest.swf) but it turned out just to be the game's preloader, which isn't the full game. But, hey, it's something. ~~Crossposting to their subreddit now.~~  Looks like their subreddit only allows posts from their website. shame."
