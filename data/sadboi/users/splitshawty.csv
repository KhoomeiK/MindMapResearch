BPD,fqfqh9q,t1_fqfp1kc,1589329717.0,"Primarily emotional abuse. 

There was one isolated incident of hitting, but we DEARMAN'ed to each other after a good week of no contact and determined we had both been vulnerable and ineffective in that conflict. We both have individual therapists who helped us make that assessment. Since then, no physical incidents whatsoever, and it's never a point of tension or fear for her/us. 

The trauma that sticks with her, the things that she brings up, are walking on eggshells, sleepless nights where I split on her or gaslit her down one of my paranoid spirals, threatening self-injury, and all the friendships I ruined for her because of my controlling behavior.  That's the shit I'm working on in DBT, and it's gotten SO much better with time -- she always says it -- but I see she gets triggered very easily now, and when she thinks I'm going to engage in old patterns, she explodes or storms out.

BPD,fluodp0,t3_fr458k,1585506683.0,"Yes! This is classic splitting. The goal is to learn to live with the splitting by finding a way to ground yourself and seek the ""middle path"". For example, you can use DBT skills like STOP, check the facts, ride the wave, mindfulness, and distraction to help get you through a split. I also encourage Journaling or writing small reminders to yourself on your phone for when you're confused.

I promise that it's possible to manage splitting  with skills, commitment, and willingness. Having a supportive partner helps too, but remember that they can only give us so much guidance, attention, and reassurance in a given day. The more we can pull our own weight, the more room we have to allow our relationships to flourish.

Sending you love."

The entire project felt like filler. It sounds poorly harmonized, tired, and uninspired at best. Some of the beats were decent, and there were a few hard-hitting lines, but any potential was overpowered by sloppy vocals/mixing and worn out verses. You mean to tell me this is their self-proclaimed magnum opus? No way. No fuckin way. 

I get the sense the boys know they have a working formula and solid fanbase, so they're producing new music simply to generate guaranteed income. IMO, this album matches the quality of their most recent performances: stiff, scripted, and corny. I can't tell you how sad I was to be at barricade for Grey Day, seeing each of the openers provide more energy and passion than they boys. Meanwhile, Scrim and Ruby stood planted on marked spots on the stage, checking the setlist every song, making cringey puns and jokes to fill up the space between songs.

serialkillers,etrug79,t1_etrtrbb,1563129353.0,"The rides go well, but there's always very lax safety and security measures. There's small stuff, like the ability to evade identification and searches. But then there's more egregious stuff that creates a generally sketchy vibe. I remember on a ride from Chciago to Los Angeles, for example, the staff received multiple complaints about an adult making sexually predatory comments to young children in our car. Rather than handle the issue directly and stir up press, the staff preferred to handle it ""quietly"" by moving the man to a neighboring car full of other, smaller kids. This was a multi-day ride, and the parents were sick with worry."

Btw, great job for mentioning that it may be a good idea to check both passenger and crew lists for potential commonalities.  

Thanks for sharing!"

I've been sitting on all my old band memorabilia for the duration of college and grad school. Recently moved back home, saw my student loan sum, and decided to dig up anything I could let go of. Bittersweet!"

They started to lose me when my library was renamed  ""liked songs"". Such a bizarre, unnecessary decision. With this new update, I'm tempted to jump ship.  But I want to give them at least one or two updates to fix their fuck up."

I've been in DBT for a minute now, and while learning basic skills has been so important for my survival, I have a long way to go. I still can't tell what's me, what's my trauma-brain, or whether those things are inextricably linked.

A common question I ask myself is ""Am I splitting, or is this really what I believe?"" In the moment, it's so fucking hard to tell."
