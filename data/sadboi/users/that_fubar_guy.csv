SuicideWatch,eykr7wx,t1_eykpry0,1567165414.0,"My marriage is in a very difficult place right now and feels like its falling apart. My job deals with death on a daily basis and my management belittles and treats its staff like idiots. It's a very well paying job and I cant find anything else available at my pay scale. So between work and home, I don't want to be either place.

I'm having dental issues at the moment but work so often I'm having a hard time eating solid food right now (I've had these worked on multiple times it's just difficult to fix because I didn't use to take care of my teeth,  my own fault I know). Just having to deal with all of this at once is very taxing."

gaybros,ewvjn1x,t1_ewp0nv4,1565807627.0,Actually that's not true. For Females it asks if you have had sex with a Male who had sex with another Male. The problem is mostly stigmas. I work in a field that uses similar forms and I dont agree with it but it is regulated by the government. I've always said safe sex is safe sex regardless of who it is with. Dont judge the agencies themselves or the people working there. It's mostly a few select people writing the guidelines that everyone has to follow and we have no control over.

gaybros,evf3fo1,t3_chry8c,1564487491.0,Talk to the dad first. Be upfront with him and treat him like and adult. Confront him about it and make him talk to the mom. If he doesn't talk to her in a timely manner then OP can talk to her about it. His dad needs to man up about it and talk to her himself. Just going straight to his mom leads down all kinds of different roads for assumptions and other unnecessary issues where if his dad talks to her it's coming straight from the horses mouth. OP's dad just needs to man up and confess himself.

raisedbynarcissists,ev16ow9,t3_ci2msu,1564153196.0,"I recently filed for a protective order against my mother and was granted the preliminary but denied the permanent because there was no threat of physical violence or damage to property. After she walked out of the courtroom after stating in front of the judge that she would no longer attempt to contact me, she waited outside. My wife and I had left the court room and were discussing what to do next when she pointed out to me that my mother had stopped, turned around and was waiting for us. She literally followed us step for step out of the building but I didn't see her after she left. We sat there worryingly the rest of the day waiting for her to fly off the handle and we did not feel at all comfortable in our own home. She violated the preliminary order twice and I reported that to the judge but she did not seem to care. I had not reported it to the police at the time of the incidents because i wrongly assumed she would not be stupid enough to violate it and did not check my blocked messages. After leaving that courtroom I definitely feel uneasy now. Do I have grounds for an appeal? I'm really not sure what to do next."
