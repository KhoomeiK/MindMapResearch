If it was the organization, it basically means they know where he's at already and has found him out. They would have easily gotten him without needing to forge a letter and use all those details from him and his wife.  Another theory is that, mary has travelled from a different dimension and she has found her way back idk lol sorry. Thank you so much or sharing this story OP! It was a thrill of a ride.
