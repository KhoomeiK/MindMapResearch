norsk,ffs0jrl,t3_euuc8d,1580170196.0,"The NTNU, Norwegian on the Web course is phenomenal. Finishing it fully she'd likely be able to have decent conversational abilities, but it won't get her fluent at all. I know a lot of language learners don't care much for it but I would personally recommend Duolingo as well. I can't vouch much for the Norwegian course itself but I have quite enjoyed the French course so far. If you have any used bookstores nearby she can likely find a language section there, and while books on Norwegian will be much harder to find than Mandarin or Spanish (at least if you live in the United States) there could still be some there. Listening to Norwegian music can help with some pronunciation as well, and submerging yourself in the culture of the language you're trying to learn is the best way to make the most progress. Don't stick to just one or two methods to learn either. It's important to take in information from a lot of different sources because while NTNU and the Duolingo course could definitely help her along the way, they are finite resources and I know Duolingo at least can be prone to mistakes occasionally and doesn't do the best job with teaching grammar for some languages. Having a multitude of sources is key to how well you pick up the language."

It was more so pointing out that (which I assume was bad information at this point) Auschwitz was such a hell-hole without being one of the primary camps involved in the actual extermination, it made me think of what the camps built for the express purpose of executions would have been like, though I didn't know the actual numbers behind it which definitely points to that being very wrong.

""I told him that I was busy considering our conduct of the war against Japan and I told him how I was trying to hold the Air Force down to precision bombing [of military/industrial targets, rather than civilians] but that with the Japanese method of scattering its manufacture it was rather difficult to prevent area bombing. I told him I was anxious about this feature of the war for two reasons: first, because I did not want to have the United States get the reputation of outdoing Hitler in atrocities; and second, I was a little fearful that before we could get ready the Air Force might have Japan so thoroughly bombed out that the new weapon [the atomic bomb] would not have a fair background to show its strength. He laughed and said he understood. Owing to the shortness of time I did not get through any further matters on my agenda.""
