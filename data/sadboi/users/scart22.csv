politics,fmsqjhc,t1_fmrgr5y,1586360387.0,"Potential for contamination? 

Let me explain something. No... there is too much. Let me sum up:

We have been told that we can use ONE yellow surgical mask per shift for theoretically non-Covid patients and ONE N95 mask per shift for our Covid rule-out patients. One. Per. Shift. When we're NOT using these masks (or swap one or the other), they are to be stored in a paper bag - a regular ol' paper bag like you'd bring your sandwich to school in. We get one of those per day too. 

And those yellow masks? There have already been days where they were not available. That means ONE N95 mask for every single patient all day. 

So the masks we're already using? They ARE contaminated. I wear the same mask into a Covid room and then into a room with someone with kidney stones. They cannot be wiped down or sprayed clean between uses. There is no question that my one mask is contaminated within a few hours of starting my shift, that the bag that I store them in is then contaminated, and that any other mask I store in that bag becomes contaminated as well.

But my P100 is a 3M, OHSA certified mask that I can WIPE DOWN COMPLETELY and 100% sanitize between patients. It fits me (because I've been trained on how to fit masks), it fits ONLY me (as opposed to the N95 masks that we have already started to RECYCLE), and wearing it would reduce the amount of PPE that I would have to otherwise burn through. 

I'm sorry... I get that there are other people ""in the organization that want\[s\] to protect you, your patients, and peers."", but if you don't work in direct patient care, I'm not inclined to give your opinion on this much weight."
politics,fmrb183,t1_fmr8ddo,1586318228.0,But what if I want to wear the OSHA certified P100 mask that’s currently sitting in my locker?

liberalgunowners,fkpts46,t1_fkpgzrz,1584419172.0,Thanks for the summary. It looks like this is where my education really needs to go next if I really want to understand this. Cheers.
liberalgunowners,fkpj6e5,t1_fkparqo,1584411410.0,"I'll give you that they're pushing for more regulation / restrictions. That's true. I've never heard anyone claim that 150 million people have died from gun violence... Not to say it's not possible that someone has, but it's certainly not a common talking point. 

Where I have an issue with this particular stand against the ""dishonest Dems"" is the idea that it's this monolithic and essentially dishonest movement. It's not. And I'm not a Democrat. I've moved so far to the left of Dems that Karl Marx sends my Christmas cards. This is not my party. But A) this is a two party system and we gotta work within that framework for now, and if we don't like that, then bust your ass to change it - but for now, it is what it is, and B) I genuinely believe that most of the people that are proposing these changes are doing it from a place of good faith. They may be misguided and uneducated, but they believe in their heart(s) of hearts that banning ""assault weapons"" and ""military grade"" hardware is the best thing they can do to keep the next Sandy Hook or Charleston or Vegas (or or or or) from occurring. They don't *specifically* want to limit your constitutional rights... they just don't see another way. 

So I pretty strongly believe that using the right-wing tactic of demonizing and generalizing the ""dishonest Dems"" is the quickest way to alienate them and make them think that this conversation is not worth having. 

And I believe it is. So how do we do that?"

liberalgunowners,fko8we7,t1_fko72wp,1584382409.0,"Thanks for the response. I have mixed thoughts about the slippery-slope argument as a logical construct.

Stop hamstringing industry!!"" are slippery-slope arguments as well, however nonsensical. 

With the coronavirus thing going on, I've been thinking a lot about ""social contracts"" lately... and I feel like simple, common sense gun regulation can fall into a perfectly reasonable category of a social contract. The obvious problem is when it comes from a place lacking common sense and legislated by the undereducated. 

And I couldn't agree more with the idea that the executive should not have as much executive power as they do. Regardless of party."

I guess a question for me, then, is *should* it be possible to fire pretty much *any* firearm at full-auto rates? This is obviously a big philosophical point, but I can tell you where many of my friends who are progressives but also 2A supporters (granted, with some reservations) are coming from... When there is a mass shooting (movie theaters, concerts, nightclubs, etc.) there can be a dozen dead people before anyone realizes what's happening. Even if you subscribe to the idea that ""only a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun"", isn't the thought of someone being able to discharge 8 rounds (12? 20?) before anyone really understands that there's a shooter something that we might give some though to? 

Even if we decided that we DID want to ban full-automatic weapons or modifications, is there any *practical* way to accomplish this? (Theoretical question)"

Do a quick google search if you don't know what this means... basically, it's an extension of your photo that tells anyone who looks the time and date it was captured, what device, what the camera settings are - and, if you have location services turned on on your phone, the GPS coordinates that it was taken in. And if it was taken in, say, your kitchen, this could be a problem.

Many image sharing services turn off the exif data on pics by default, so randos who look at your pics won't be able to access the data... but some don't. And we all know that the end user agreements for these services change constantly. Don't take the chance.
