My brother is obsessed with memes from several years ago. He is also obsessed with Bloons TD (tbh this was my fault lol I introduced him to it). He constantly sends me gameplays on youtube or excitedly talks about new game strategies he read online. Do I find it annoying? Of course I do. I like the game, but not as much as he does. Would I tell him to stop talking about it? Hell no. It's something he's interested in, and the feeling of being shut down when talking about an interest really sucks. It feels like shit. I don't want to put him through that. 

And he's 13. Your 'brother' is 8, which is way younger, so the damage would be worse. Just let people talk about their interests. Maybe find some ways to compromise, like tell him you're busy and will talk later. But if you say that, make sure you follow through on your promise to talk later."

I'm always too slow to catch up with what everyone else is doing, and they think I'm lazy or don't know my shit well enough to work with them.
