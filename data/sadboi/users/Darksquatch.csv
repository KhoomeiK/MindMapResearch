SNHU,fjevm09,t1_fjeuvis,1583279045.0,"I already had a job, I went back to school just to have a bachelor's degree. It was more a point of pride than anything else. With that being said I WAS able to get into a Master's program with my degree and a 3.8 GPA. But it was another online school (ASU). I think it depends on your field. Honestly, in some ways I feel like SNHU WAS a joke. Especially after learning more about how they pay and hire their instructors. I'm not sure the success rate of getting a doctorate with a bachelor's from SNHU but I can tell you that if you're looking for mentorship and developing connections in your field SNHU is probably not your best choice. But everything I say is from experience in my own program. It's possible that it is different in other programs and I'm definitely not trying to scare you out of school. I'm just trying to give some advice that I wish I had known."
SNHU,fje83b6,t1_fjdu0zx,1583266857.0,"I'm an SNHU graduate with a BA in History. I don't want to pop your excitement bubble but a lot of instructors honestly don't care. As long as you are posting and responding you get full points on discussion boards. If there are readings you should reference them. As far as ""your awesomeness"" goes you are probably going to hit a wall of discouragement at some point because again, instructors are going to basically just make sure you did it and met the rubric and avoided obvious grammar or basic issues. I had the same professor for 2 classes in my major classes. This is a rarity as far as I know. Most people don't have the same professor more than once, almost every professor is an adjunct.

Again. I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer but I feel like with the money you spend to go to SNHU you should have realistic expectations of what you are going to run into. There is very little actual engagement at least within my experience. Others may have had a different experience but for me SNHU was more or less a way for me to get my degree pretty much independently and with very little direction. 

TL;DR Good luck, prepare to be mildly disappointed"

It's easy to take things for granted but I do have an incredible family and am lucky enough to have married into a second incredible family ;). Things get better. If this has taught me anything it is that people in the world really do love and care about other people. There is good in the world sometimes it's just hard to see.

Tacoma,fchq78k,t1_fchnmaw,1577652973.0,"I think the economic benefit can be a good thing and the city can use it to reinvest but it won't solve the problem that Tacoma and Pierce county as a whole have a large population of people living near or below the poverty line (myself included). Inevitably rent and housing costs are going to increase. I know in many ways this is unavoidable, but there needs to be a plan in place other than forcing these people out of the community because they can no longer afford to live here. That's my 2 cents anyways."
Tacoma,fchih8z,t3_ehaehq,1577650748.0,"Could be an unpopular opinion but Seattle and the East Side can have the tech boom. High paying jobs are good for a few but drive everyone else out of the market. Tacoma is already at a point where low income people are being priced out. Bring the tech boom only if Tacoma can figure out how to have it and still provide support for it's low income residents, because Seattle certainly hasn't been able to."

cars,fb10tan,t3_eakosk,1576431164.0,"I have owned a 2007 GXP for 3 years. I could probably write a novel about the things that make me scratch my head about it to this day. Why the belt tensioner requires a special tool that no one knows exists and costs 400 dollars online (if you need a tensioner hack take off the splash guard on the passenger side and put a hose clamp around the tensioner spring and slip the belt off). Why I have to argue with every tire shop I go to that yes this is maybe the only vehicle in existence where the staggered wheels go in front and no I didn't put my wheels in the wrong spot. Why a full size sedan can have a smaller interior than my 2000 Toyota Corolla and have literally no comfortable seating position (you just get used to it after a while). Why I've replaced the power steering pump three times with genuine AC Delco pumps and it still sounds like it has a supercharger. My dream was to own one of these or the Impala SS, and now that I've owned one I can honestly say whoever decided to cram these motors into these cars was an absolute madman. If you buy one and plan to work on it yourself, nothing they did will make sense. Overall rating 10/10 until you open the hood, you magnificent, cruel bastards. Also unless you want to do it yourself save about 5 grand for when your tranny blows up. Have a shop do it and get a warranty, you're gonna need it."

Tacoma,f8yxin2,t1_f8xdfzn,1574954206.0,"I live in Lakewood, in the Woodbrook neighborhood about a mile from the JBLM logistics gate. This neighborhood is pretty bad, but very cheap. Lakewood really falls into a whole bunch of different neighborhoods some are very nice and some are not. In the Woodbrook/Tillicum neighborhood area we have seen a lot of violent crime in the 2 years since we moved here including a few homicides very close by. And yes people refer to as Lakewood as Lakehood, and to Woodbrook as Hoodbrook. I would suggest doing some research and looking into the different neighborhoods in Lakewood. I have heard very good things about Oakbrook so maybe start there?"

You are not ugly, friends come and go but what has helped me is learning to be my own friend. Self love is so important even if you're just lying to yourself at first. Tell yourself your smart, your attractive, and you're good enough and hopefully eventually you can convince yourself it's true. I won't give you any lines about killing yourself hurting those around you, it will more than you could possibly know. But what I think is more important is you will lose the opportunity to have better days. And I promise you you will. I know I'm an internet stranger but I am here for you. You will get through this. I believe in you. There will be good and bad days but eventually you will feel better. You are strong and you can do this. You have faced the demon this far, keep fighting."
