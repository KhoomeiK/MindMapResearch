gaybros,fqbc8l6,t3_ghvrko,1589234338.0,You're just weird. Lol
gaybros,fpwyjcs,t3_gft4j2,1588972318.0,"I know how that feeling goes. Its rare to find a guy that shares my interests or style. I'm going to probably being single for life but its that's my fate, so be it.."
BPDmemes,fptc0w3,t3_gfa6r6,1588888501.0,"Go ahead. I'm worthless and unwanted so you're doing the world a favor. I bet we could of been great friends too. I think we probably have a lot in common but I'm sure you'd get bored of me eventually and move on to better people. I'm pretty fucking useless and deserve to die. Actually give me the knife I'll do it myself, fuck this exsistance. Good luck out there.. I hope you dont get caught."
yaoi,fkavoyn,t3_fgxtfs,1584020560.0,I would love to adopt this cute kitty.  :P
BPD,ff0bi6y,t1_fezesf2,1579467246.0,Well that actually give me some hope if that's the case..  Guess I'll have to actually read my DBT book instead of rolling my eyes at it like I usually do.
BPD,feyhwvb,t1_fewm6o3,1579445811.0,"That's what I keep hearing, but I've been think way for so long and had this thought process for so long that I wonder if I'll ever change it because it's so ingrained into my being. It's kind of a part of who I am now. :("
BPD,feuodvr,t1_feqlh5z,1579388441.0,"I'm trying.  I really am trying, it's just so hard."
BPD,fel6ze7,t3_eph5dd,1579215402.0,"OMG, this is exactly how I feel about this girl I'm dating.  She doesn't know about my BPD and I'm terrified to tell her.. Regardless she'll see it eventually if we last that long. I really really want it to work out cause shes my type. I'm use to us constantly talking and I get to see her tommorow too so that will help I think.

But I've noticed the harder I fall the worse my insecurities get..  If there is a long pause in us talking I start thinking the worst.  It's a nasty cycle of thinking that I wish I could break. It's really hard.."
BPD,fekkn3b,t3_epldwt,1579202026.0,Congrats!  I hope it lasts for a while.  Mine usually last a couple hours then I'll switch to some thing else.
BPD,fehefqa,t3_ep4is6,1579114849.0,Proud of you! Remember not to rush. :)
BPDmemes,feakm9y,t3_eo5jo0,1578949913.0,"Yes, yes, and yes!"
BPD,fe0e6ts,t3_enjbuu,1578811610.0,"I'm sorry your relationship got ruined. I can only imagine how that must of made you feel given what having BPD does in situations like that(I'm assuming you have it).   I have a journal I've had since I was 16 and its filled with lots of depressing and dark thoughts I've had... some even venture into the realm of disturbing, but I digress...  

If I had girlfriend who left me later reading my journal it would probably push me further towards the edge. I'd hate myself even more then I already and reinforce the idea that I'm irreparably broken and no one will ever want me.

I'm sorry you had to go through that.. -hug-"
BPDmemes,fe0c7st,t3_enj2i8,1578809457.0,I cant sleep at all when I think about that kind of stuff. I have to take a sleep aide just to fall asleep. Otherwise I'll be up all night thinking about really bad stuff.
BPD,fe0bzr2,t3_enjbuu,1578809230.0,"Damn.. that's pretty intense and does make you stop and think what some one else was possibly going through. 

I wrote out a suicide note a long time ago explaining in detail what goes on in my head and why I felt the only escape from the pain was ending my life. Just in case people are curious. Obviously I'm still here but I never threw it away. I keep it in my drawer just in case it's ever needed for some....reason"

BPD,fdz3em4,t3_eneo5f,1578786288.0,"That fee is insane! So glad mine doesn't charge that cause I'd had to cancel on short notice a couple times in the past.

Today is a pretty awful day though. Worse than usual."
BPD,fdymf9u,t3_en8kc5,1578781320.0,I really hope so cause I'd like to try life over again..
BPDmemes,fdyl930,t3_endecf,1578781007.0,Lmao.  That's basically what goes through my head after I tell my date what my issues are..
selfcare,fdyeqsh,t3_cuyzb3,1578778963.0,I let my battery on my phone die all the time so I guess that means I'm really fucked.  Lol

BPD,fdsputy,t3_emyry4,1578706395.0,You made it through and still breathing. Be proud of yourself!
BPD,fdsle69,t1_fdskrwl,1578704686.0,It's pretty stupid isn't it?
BPD,fdrwh1j,t3_emse40,1578690759.0,Heya and welcome.  I remember I had my own struggle with being Hypo. I thought I had all sorts of horrible stuff going on and that I would be dead soon. I finally got out of that way of thinking with some mindfulness and after a couple of years of not dying from all the stuff I thought I had. lol
BPD,fdrvmss,t3_emrmqz,1578690378.0,"I know that feeling all too well. I just end up making people hate me or think I'm a psycho.  I have a strong urge/need to be loved and wanted by any one, but I just punish myself by forcing myself to isolate and tell myself no one will like you or want you in their life because I'll just end up hurting people's feelings and I'll have to suffer losing yet another person I wanted a connection with."
BPD,fdrr01q,t1_fdrjsj6,1578688330.0,"I've heard a variation of that line before too..   I considering myself and others who can see that their behavior isn't the norm and attempt to take steps to change for the better as lucky. We are lucky that we have enough self awareness to see our words and our actions, and the end result of them. After about the 10th time of losing a friend and being called a psycho by some one I started to see a pattern.  Sadly, others aren't so lucky."
BPD,fdrq6dq,t1_fdrc307,1578688097.0,"You're fine, don't worry. I know what you were trying to say and I am very thankful for it.  -hug-"
BPD,fdra5qq,t1_fdr506a,1578681590.0,"I don't think I'm at that point yet where I can just say oh well I don't care what people think, cause I still very much do care what others think...to an almost crippling degree. I've lost close friends and girlfriends because I was honest about myself.  I have started learning to just keep my mouth shut about my personal issues and try to seem as ""normal"" as possible.  They'll always get to see me at my worst at some point.  Why spoil the surprise right?"
BorderlinePDisorder,fdm1ygr,t3_eluzu5,1578537882.0,"When I get extremely stressed out and upset I some times punch myself on my thighs, so I guess it's common to hit yourself, maybe?"
BorderlinePDisorder,fdm1lga,t3_em1h9x,1578537639.0,"I'm in a similar situation myself.  My ex gf broke up with me just recently and every day all I can think of is her and wanting to talk to her.  I  told myself to not go overboard and text her all day yet I find myself doing that which is probably pissing her off.   

I'm just lonely and miss her so much. Every day is a struggle cause all I can think about is her.

Like xosvain said just distract yourself with other things. I'm trying to do that myself."
BPD,fdlgaor,t3_eluild,1578523394.0,"I would love to have a jealous girlfriend. At least then I would know she love me very much and the risk of them leaving me would be lower than one who just would say,  ""Oh have fun tonight!"" ...then my mind would start thinking, ""hmmm.. she doesnt seem too bothered by me just up and leaving so obvious she doesn't care about me... OMG she's getting ready to dump me..."""
BPD,fdkcsbh,t3_elm39b,1578501142.0,I try to avoid the mirror as much as possible because once I do I will spend more time there than I should looking at every flaw I have and wishing I could fix it. It'll send me into a depression spin and make me feel ugly and worthless. It's a nasty cycle..
