I had to close the post after seeing the video cause I could already hear the gnar raging at kayn and the comments were truly something. I was a jungle main and I still play it from time to time (despite always being a fairly noob player).

Some things I always knew about jungle is that Jungler is not a babysitter, it's not his work to win you the lane but to help you push the enemy to burn resources and make you stuff easier, not instant win; and the most important, you don't go to lost lands, people really miss this one, rate at you for not going where someone already died 2 Or 3 times, sure, depends on the enemy top laner too, but if there is a Darius with already 2 kills and lvl 6 while your too it's lvl 4, going top will only make things worse.
But hey, if you don't go, you get reported, if you go and you don't kill, you get reported, if you go and die, you get reported."

My issue with fortnite is that I don't really see room for actual skill, every ""top play"" I see is just the same building madness followed by jumping in circles with a shot gun. Yeah, whatever.
That isn't fun.

In other platforms, specially PC, people are more oriented to play that way and only that way, if you go and try to fight mid range or sniper range you just get crushed by some idiot rushing you with a building that not only will go above yours, will end you killing you with one cheap head shot.

But... I have my input here, while I don't usually rage at normals, they are normals, you still play to try to win and above all have fun. I 99% of the time play ranked, where you play to win and, still, above that, have fun. The thing is, a few years back i used to have all the time in the world to play and play and play, but recently I am unable to play more than 2 to 4 games (4 in a good day without work/classes - the Quarantine helped, of course), so when I go play ranked (normals I don't mind that much, just giving my opinion here to somehow justify some of the toxic people out there) if someone is playing really badly or trolling, I rage for the simple reason that I had a long day or finally the time to play and I want to enjoy myself.
Often I see how people denies to surrender 99% lost games in normals or ranked, make fun of the situation and so on, but the ones doing this don't understand how valuable time is, I don't have the time to go and play 10 games a day to make up for the messed up 2 I got, I have the time just to play maybe 3 or 4 tops, if I don't get the best of it because someone picks X champ for the first time (in ranked) or is unable to read or strickly trolls, I am going to get furious cause my time is being thrown away.

Just that, my 2 cents here.

I am sorry for your situation, I don't really have an advice more than use the Mute button, specially now that you are willing to learn outside the fame and the second thing, try to get people to play with you so you can go to normals with a more chill experience where you will learn.

And for what I said, I wanted to get it out there, so people could realize that time is valuable and maybe you have all day to play your favorite game (for now), but someday you'll be able to just play an hour, two hours, so you will see how being stubborn and voting no in a surrender vote or trolling is not worth it at all, specially for you."

Her strongest talent went from 20 to 10%, despite the overall complains, PC players always adviced the same, aim for the feet, which is harder on console where she remains permabanned. She is hated all across the board, ironic since I see Vivians with 100+ level that can barely aim.

Apparently (I am not deeply aware of the meta, competitive paladins is a whole another world for me), in ""soloq"", the usual bans are Terminus, Vivian (on console its mandatory, since cross play its almost a must), Bomb king (just learning him, he can be really lethal), Talus and Maeve, a good Maeve always is a pain since he can execute. Oh, and also Evie is a hot pick in higher elos but only for PC. 

The overall comp in ""soloq"" is 1 support, 1 damage, 1 flak and 2 tanks (one for point and other as off tank to go front line). It can vary, maybe you have flanks that are really sure of dealing the damage, or a tank that can hold the zone while everyone pushes, etc.

I recommend watching competitive paladins, it's really something, but as you should know, like lol, the competitive environment doesn't translate well into ""soloq"".

Some most contested picks are Barik + Jenos, Tyra depending on the other team tanks, Inara, Ash, Khan, Furia, Koga and Buck (he seems weak, but a good buck is so versatile with his talents that can deal with any comp).

I had my issues for years now, I didn't take them seriously enough until suicidal thoughts started approaching me. Won't go deeper into that since I will write pages about that.

The thing is, i hit rock bottom, I went to look for help and the therapist told me on the first session ""I don't wanna scare you and I don't wanna rush into things, but you might have a condition, we will look into that in the next sessions"".

That took me into searching by my own (not really healthy or recomendable BTW), and turns out that I check every symptom box for borderline (and 75% of DID, but that's another whole story).

While I am not completely sure that I have that cause I have not been diagnosed by a professional, all the research I did points out that I do. I think the most important thing to think about is equilibrium.

Every time I get my equilibrium tainted, my emotions go into a rampage and I tend to ruin any kind of relationship I have, go into a self destructive behavior or I just can't hold myself together to do simple things. It requieres me way more effort to stay focused into simple things like reading for homework or even don't get insanely depressed while working and leave all together.

I swear, they have like 4 or 5 episodes, and if you show that to anyone they will hate Boruto to the end of times."

The manga it is awesome, don't get me wrong, but the anime took its time to build up the characters and make me care about everyone... Except namida and her team, those episodes were just the worst of the worst."

I actually get bored playing normals, the competitive environment is what makes it fun for me, but long ago I stopped trying the whole and solely mentality of just playing to win.

I want and I like to win, but that's just part of the fun. I don't mind losing a close/intense game, but I won't lose my mind raging over obsessing with the only porpuse of winning.

I said what I said cause it seems lacking the fact that winning and improving are not an actual part of having fun."

For the little I know I just can say that I used to be really annoying and stubborn, don't get me wrong, I still am getting pissed at certain little stuff or attitudes I don't approve.

But one of the first points that I had to work on when I went to therapy was to realize that everyone is stupid so I shouldn't bother... NAH, KIDDING, sorry.
That everyone is different and no one is going to fit with *my* high standards. I have to be flexible and accept that others just do things differently.

For example, I play card games, or well, before Quarantine I did. I like to have my deck, hand and table clean and in order to do so, but most of the time people that I play with have their cards dirty as hell, put their cards in the table making an unreadable mess and so on. It pisses me off but I had to fully accept that I have my ways, others have theirs.


One exercise that my therapist made me do was to bake something, she didn't really care about the taste, but she wanted me to check the process. The meaning of the exercise was to understand that even if I don't know how to cook (or even if I did), I had an idea of what I was going to do before starting, then the end result is not the same, this should make me realize that nothing is exactly as planned and that I don't have to be so down or pissed about the end result, I can and I have the chance to improve for next time instead of being pissed and frustrated all over.

Little things that you don't realize no matter how smart you are until you either hit rock bottom or start therapy"

Don't download it again, discover and play other games.


Ok, in a serious note, if you are using a SD card, could be that it is not functioning well, that you need to clean your switch as a whole or that your net connection is just really bad the moment the game loads."

In Bolivia is such a sad thing the punctual thing, that if you say 5pm,you can expect stuff to start at 7. No joke here. Concert venues, conventions, gatherings are like that and it's beyond usual and pisses me off to oblivion.

mentalhealth,fp636fb,t3_gbgaq2,1588345197.0,"This is a tricky one, tbh.

I have to ways for this, an intervention, like the ones seen on TV where you get the love ones around and try to convince the person in trouble. No idea if that works, I watch a lot of TV.. So...

The second thing is to let the person hit rock bottom and then offer your hand to help and make the person to get professional help.

People that are troubled are usually getting more and more arrogant as time passes since the mind starts defending itself by rejecting others and denying any advice. Even if they want help, the habit of being closed in themselves makes them just rely solely in others and hurt everyone around just to remain ""OK"" by their means.

But seriously, I've seen this game in action, 85% of the time the ball just won't go in and he would get players kicked out with a red cards for no reason.

Just the other day he got paired with a troll that let him do whatever he wanted, the troll even took the goal keeper away the goal. In a free kick, he did exactly that, moved the keeper away to let the ball go in. He kicked the ball, scored... But he didn't score at all, the game took it like the ball miss the mark. The replay was there to see the ball go in, and still he didn't score. Despite all that, he won that match, obviously with total discomfort. If that happens with a troll, I can't imagine the matches I don't watch and he has to deal with all that bullshit and a player that isn't giving away the game."
