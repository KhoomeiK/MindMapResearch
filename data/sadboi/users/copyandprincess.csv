AskReddit,fgcn924,t3_extt40,1580674336.0,"As far as hair care goes, it pays to stay away from any brand you can get for under $10 (so basically any drugstore brand) - especially stay away from Suave and Pantene. These products essentially coat your hair in a waxy plastic residue, which can make it appear as if it‚Äôs acting right at first but overtime will build up and might lead to hella damage. If you‚Äôre gonna go cheap on your hair care products, stick to more ‚Äúnatural brands‚Äù like Love Beauty and Planet, Shea Moisture, OGX, brands like that. 

Or, at the very least, get a clarifying treatment when you have your hair cut and before you get it colored. 

Stay wary of box dyes (Garnier, L‚ÄôOr√©al) because there is no way of knowing what volume developer is used in their formulation/how much ammonia goes into it. That can lead to hair loss or horrid color turnout.
