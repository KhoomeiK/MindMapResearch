If a parent really loved their child, would they have brought them into this world? A world where you work for most of your life, sell your body to a corporation, pay a corrupt government, break bones occasionally, get badly sick occasionally, have a chance of being raped, beaten, robbed, the list goes on. It is inhumane to give life to a child in this world; it is the opposite of the loving thing to do--and yet it is done as an act of love.

1. If killing (and I'll assume you also mean harm/suffering-creation) is done unnecessarily, it is immoral.
2. The consumption of animal products causes killing and suffering
3. Eating meat/dairy/eggs is not necessary if you have access to a vegan diet
4. Therefore, if you can eat vegan, then eating animal products causes unnecessary killing/suffering.

I'm very curious as to why you are so pro-circumcision, if you see it as so minimal in either benefit or harm. Why do you not value the consent of the individual? Again, in Europe only religious people have this done. It's clearly unnecessary and violates bodily-autonomy. 

I never claimed it was worse than FGM. I likened the two. They are very similar. Male circumcision is closer to the removal of the clitoral hood.

So what, I'll ask again, is your justification for doing it? We've been debating the medical side, but what is your actual logical reason for it being ok to force this unnecessary procedure on a baby?

And by the way, considering that 13% of circumcised men resent that it was done to them, it's quite clear that this is not benign to the psychology of those who feel traumatize and violated.

One good example is media often cite a particular statistic, saying circumcision reduces your chance of HIV by 60%. This refers to a study done in which the circumcised group had approx 1.6% chance and the uncut group had approx 2.8% chance; technically, 1.6 is approx 60% of 2.8, but to say that you're 60% less likely is a complete perversion of honest reporting. Not only that but in that study, the circumcised group was shown how to use condoms! (obviously making the study much less precise and even laughable as evidence).

Now, their is ample evidence of the ptsd and trauma caused, as well as counterevidence relating to hygiene myths, but misinformation is insidious, as we vegans know.

A foreskin has the most nerve endings of anywhere in the penis.

Circumcised guys think that the head of the dick is the most sensitive part, but they don't realize that the foreskin has 5 separate parts that are more sensitive. The movement from the inner to outer prepuce is the most sexually-stimulating area. It is removed during circumcision. The foreskin also plays an important role in sexual functioning, since it acts as a natural lubricant and reduced friction (it actually moves in a gliding motion, going back and forth on the glans).

Circumcised guys think that the head of the dick is the most sensitive part, but they don't realize that the foreskin has 5 separate parts that are more sensitive. The movement from the inner to outer prepuce is the most sexually-stimulating area. It is removed during circumcision. The foreskin also plays an important role in sexual functioning, since it acts as a natural lubricant and reduced friction (it actually moves in a gliding motion, going back and forth on the glans).

Simply, you are wrong, and you are clearly doing a lot to deny facts and empiricism."""
CircumcisionGrief,fmx3wqj,t1_fmx3610,1586458014.0,Yes! The more we talk the more minds we change. Honestly just being a bit forward and saying it can help spark discussion. I do the same thing with animal rights issues.
blursedimages,fmx3s22,t1_fmx360u,1586457949.0,"You aren't tougher. You are just less sensitive to pleasure and pain. There's nothing superior about your mind. If you mutilated your fingers and couldn't feel without your fingers, you wouldn't be tougher.

The fact is that even if you don't experience conscious trauma, the body remembers something like that, especially the period of desensitization as a baby, and regardless your sexual satisfaction and functioning are tremendously lowered. Cut guys have more erectile dysfunction and prejaculation issues. I hope you can see reason."
blursedimages,fmx325b,t1_fmx2tm3,1586457584.0,"Fuck yeah! I've been getting a lot of replies to the contrary, all by circumcised guys who have tok much cognitive dissonance to admit it. I'd feel bad for them, but it's clear that they will mutilate their own boys if they have the chance. Trauma breeds trauma, viscious cycle."
blursedimages,fmx2se5,t1_fmx1g75,1586457444.0,"...your dick doesn't hurt because it has lost so much sensitivity. I'm actually baffled at how obtuse you are being. Uncut guys are highly sensitive. They have fine-touch receptors. Check for yourself. Can you feel fine-touch or is it just a sensation of pressure? In any case, what you have just said proves you have lost a tremendous amount of sensitivity. If an intact guy rubbed his glans against a fabric, he's scream in pain. The whole point of the glans is to be sensitive. It's essentially a male outer clitoris, and the foreskin is like a clitoral hood."
blursedimages,fmx1643,t1_fmx0vsv,1586456622.0,Look into foreskin restoration. It changes lives.

blursedimages,fmx01bw,t1_fmwzqyv,1586456047.0,"You don't care because you don't know what was lost. This is a ridiculous statement. I'll say it again, if you realized what the foreskin actually did, you'd be overcome with anger."

CircumcisionGrief,fmwz9ot,t1_fmwxznb,1586455657.0,Yeah but u can still see the comments and all. Sort by controversial and mine should come up
blursedimages,fmwz7hu,t1_fmwycor,1586455626.0,"A lot of people don't talk about trauma. If you're really interested in this and not just some half-wit troll, go ask people. I've already provided empirical evidence of it, but if that isn't enough and you rely on stories to make decisions (you shouldn't, but I guess that's what you're like), then go read some stories. Go to r/foreskinrestoration and ask people who are restoring their foreskins why they are doing it.

Again, if you won't take empirical evidence, you're just not going to be able to be convinced. You can also ask yourself if you support female circumcision. If you do, then that's crazy, and if you don't, then you're just a biased sexist who thinks guys should man up and not be upset about mutilation like women are."
blursedimages,fmwsg8r,t1_fmwrnic,1586452220.0,"It's also not SJW to point out that mutilating a penis will cause harm. You have done a lot to convince yourself it's OK, and that's understandable considering the situation. It's hard to admit that your parents could allow and support something so awful. I hope you come around to reason. The rest of the world except for states dominated by religion already have..."
blursedimages,fmws7a2,t1_fmwrnic,1586452095.0,"not a woman, but again if I were it wouldn't change science. You clearly didn't learn too much in school did u? More of a sports guy? Lol"

Assuming I'm a woman doesn't make me a woman, and even if I were, it wouldn't change science.

You should look up the difference between anecdotal evidence and empirical evidence. Sayin ""I'm fine with it and know people who are fine with it"" is not only anecdotal, but is a fallacious counterexample, because it uses the logic of:
If A then B
Not A
Therefore, not B

This is not how logic works. Learn some stuff before defending monstrous acts. If you want to see pseudoscience, look at the the AAP, which is the reason it's so popular in the US, and which almost every other national pediatric association calls an embarrassment to scientific research."
blursedimages,fmwjumv,t1_fmuxrse,1586447876.0,"Additionally, you are evidently suffering from denial of loss, and it reflects in your poor attempts at defending your own mutilation.

By poor attempts, I mean that you are using only anecdotal evidence rather than science. 

Here is some actual science. I think you'll find the portion on denial particularly relevant:

There are operations that are less destructive and less intrusive than circumcision. Dorsal slits, for example, and there is another I am forgetting that is like a dorsal slit but has the incision repaired. I'd recommend talking to ppl on r/foreskinrestoration."

Here is a general article which cites many papers:

I'd like you to say what you've said on such forums as r/circumcisiongrief, r/foreskinrestoration, r/foregen, and other support groups not on reddit.

Additionally, it's not just about trauma. It's also about losing feeling and losing the ability to have full orgasms. People who restore their foreskin report better sex in function and feeling. Your views are not only anti-scientific, but normalize barbaric religious practices."
blursedimages,fmwhhcn,t1_fmuxrse,1586446665.0,"Ok? This is meaningless. You're just saying you don't care. The fact that more ppl complain is irrelevant. It's about trauma, not complaining, you equivocating moron.

Why don't you care about having been circumcised? Are you unaware of the consequences?"
blursedimages,fmuc2yc,t1_fmu64b1,1586388476.0,"Totally agree. But also be warned. Many urologists suggest circumcision as a first solution to issues like phimosis, when phimosis can be cured in many not-intrusive ways, and if needed can be fixed with a small incision in the foreskin. I think it's called a dorsal slit, but there's a version which reattaches the cut."

Saying you are amoral is not the same as being it, and I'm concerned with all forms of hypocrisy. But hey keep living in your world of pretended freedom from neurosis. We all know where you really stand."
Libertarian,fmtiq8o,t1_fmti5yo,1586373412.0,"Once again, I question the intellectual honesty here. This implies that if it were great (ie felt very good), you would do it. Is that really your reason for not raping a kid? Because it would be that enjoyable? Do you not see an issue with the act itself, regardless of pleasure utility?"
Libertarian,fmtc4nh,t1_fmtayhl,1586370255.0,So why wouldn't you rape a baby? You seemed to skip over that answer quickly.
