Takes a team and strong leadership to make it all come together. Then sustainability at that level is incredibly difficult which only adds to the amount of small teams that never seem to get a chance to grow. It takes years of work if you don‚Äôt raise a ton to spend on marketing."

The company (just as every other company) can leverage its user-base, aka captive audience to expand revenue streams in the future via partnerships and advertising. This is more of a business principal rather than a unique to Jumper revenue stream. 

For example this is how esports teams generate much of their income, they gain sponsors because they have a captive audience. (Aka their fan base)"

Lessons don‚Äôt come for free. Failure is not free. It can come with the loss of status, self-worth, friendships, and immense emotional, physical, and financial distress, and it can lead to self-doubt. That is why many people fear failure.

But when you can change perspective, identify your weaknesses, strengthening them by being an active participant in your brains and spirits growth with a quest for knowledge and maturation. You not only get to digest but your brain and soul get to metabolize all nutrients available in these most valuable lessons.

And that‚Äôs what makes the associated pain that stems from failure worth it. Making every decision & experience truly ‚Äúrisk free‚Äù (Within reason). Because no matter what, when you have perspective and practice self-reflection you will always be able to take away valuable lessons even from your most disastrous defeats.

Tip for Self-Reflection: Take a step out of your own shoes. Reflect on past decisions with an open mind, do not overly critique or look down upon negative things. Rather with an open mind see the mistakes only as they are, extract the lesson from them and move on. You are not a finished product, you‚Äôre a work in progress growing stronger after each extraction of a hard earned lesson.

Learn from your mistakes, stay fast in your morals, values, principles, and always have integrity."

Never forgot your why, as long as your why is intact you will succeed. Your why will give you the motivation to push forward.

All human adults fear the unknown

Just as a small child is not afraid of the monsters in the closest, but truly afraid of what they really don‚Äôt know yet.  
Modern human adults are scared of the dark. The dark that comes at the ending of each of our Lives (biological clocks).  
When I finally grew up I learned to not be afraid of the dark, for monsters do not exist. & that gives me hope, for in the future we can find out what truly lies beyond the scope of our current imagination. Life is beautiful.¬†
