SuicideWatch,fol8x7b,t3_g6qx7q,1587857217.0,"I'm really sorry you had to go through that and I hope you feel better. Being in anime communities, I stumble across a lot of simulated CSEM (also called lolicon and shotacon), which is generally deemed as acceptable as no real children are presumably being harmed, but still disturbing to look at in my opinion. one time I was looking through the ""realism"" tag on Pixiv and saw a very explicit drawing of a man raping a little girl. I felt sick to my stomach and wanted to cry. 
Although it's fictional, it was enough to ruin my vision of children and their media, and I oftentimes get scared I might be a predator even though it never crossed my mind before I saw these images. Whenever I see a cute character, I can't help but think about how people want to fuck them, and it used to be enough to ruin my entire day. 

I can't even begin to imagine what you had to go through especially with CSEM of real kids.
I believe you did the right thing. Take care of yourself and remember that you're a better person than you think you are."

Anxiety,f0mxkzz,t3_d5he1h,1568755429.0,"I'm undergoing through therapy while on medication. I was set on my way by a neurologist, who prescribed me both a psychologist and an antidepressant... It's been less than a year and I'm not feeling much change in myself besides my thoughts patterns and the fact that I'm more enclined to have fun than before. But hey, recovery doesn't happen overnight, does it ? 

I hope everything will be alright for you, OP."

Oh, and it accelerates transit so that's a plus, I guess."
