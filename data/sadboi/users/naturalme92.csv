It got to a point that versa started being late and couldn't sync to show proper time. i had to reinstall everything - the app, factory reset watch and set up it all again after 9 months of usage. Seems to be workings now (however, it's been 24h since reinstallation.)
Edit: oh nvm. Last synced 6h ago and can't sync again."

If you don't feel like talking with your close ones, talk with doctor. I hope that you'll take time to make the very hard step and talk with your SO. They may think that it's less than it's actually is... 
So much good luck❤️"

I hope for both you that your husband comes to terms and accepts his trigger - i hope then it will be possible to try to fight it more.
The idea of unique birthday songs is so so adorable ❤️
Best of luck for both of you!"

IMHO, take some rest and let the situation rest too.(i know it's easier said than done). Your boyfriend was probably doing his best to calm you down and he understands that it wasn't you- that was the panic attack. 

I hope that you'll manage to get a good night of sleep ♥️"

I do rice with baked chicken, baked broccoli heads and ketjap sauce. I also do tomato sauce (just be careful which tomatoes you buy, i do the cheapest box from Dirk) with some fried minced meat and shredded carrot. With that i do some GF pasta and saladmix. 
And i looove GF pasta with lactose-free sour creme with some hard cheese (grand pananamo etc.) With chicken in it, a bit of sundired tomatoes or air dried ham... Surely least healthy option.
Another one is salmon baked with a bit of butter and potatoes in a pocket made of parchment paper. 
For all amounts of stuff i always check Monash university app. I'm not sure if it's all appropriate for fodmap elimination phase, but it does work for me :)"

AnxietyDepression,fcwo5vk,t3_ej6ehk,1578031328.0,"You're not alone in it. Last years weren't the easiest for me, but still, overall, i am one very lucky human being. And i know that i have so much to live for. And at the same time, i hate myself, i hate the state im in, i hate this disease that i can't see and that makes me feel so unwilling to do anything. It's a struggle. I had therapy, wasn't the best, now i have to wait... Approximately half a year for new one. 

So, my point is, you're not alone and like comments before me said- this disease doesn't choose only the unlucky in life ones. It's real, it hits everybody. First step is realising it, second is seeking help (and changing it, if needed), third is accepting and working on it.
I know you can do it ❤️ it's just gonna be a long and bumpy ride."

AnxietyDepression,fcva8uj,t3_ej13vo,1577997889.0,"I think i sort of understand what you mean. I have a similar thoughts sometimes- i can't imagine hurting myself (well, apart from episode of two) but very often i think house life would go if i just disappeared. How would my fiancé live without me, how my parent's life would go on... It's almost like a wish of never existing...
My life is good and I'm blessed to have what i have, and I'm very aware of that. But there's always that thought of disappearing is almost always there...

On the other hand, almost year ago i heard the diagnosis of combination of heavy deppresion, being overworked and anxiety. It was at a point they had no idea what to treat first - ended up with anxiety. Can't say it helped much, I'm switching doctors, so i hope it will help.

I really wish i could help you in any way. I hope that at least those words, that you're not alone with it will help. Perhaps just talk (without the need to diagnose or medicine), just pure talk with a stranger could help? 
All the best for you and your baby ♥️"

unpopularopinion,fcpsc7q,t3_eidn1l,1577871079.0,"Puppy mills are. Thoughtless breeding for a quick buck is awful and immoral.
Wise breading that is based on parent's health and personality traits is what should be continued. But unfortunately, only people who truly care about certain breeds, have enough understanding and knowledge (about breed, biology and genetics), have cash flow to support it really do it that way. 

I waited for my dog for many months. Before that, i researched for months breeders in my country. Father of my dog is from completly different country. It today's society it can be hard for some people to wait for so long for sth..."

For example, in my country of origin there's a massive group of people who lives off only child benefits introduced few years ago. Their goal is to pop as many kids as they can to get more money.

unpopularopinion,f9kv3wt,t3_e5je1m,1575408473.0,"Omg no. 
What should be banned is irresponsible breeding of dogs with health issues! It's so easy to test for most common problems... 
Unfortunately, pugs are very fashionable breed and many people breed them purely for money, not for the well being of the dog. And what's even worse, it's not just problem with pugs, but also with so many other breeds...

And yes, i have a pug. I've spend half year researching different breeders and after that waited another half a year for a litter. He has no breathing problems, is active and happy doggo without any health problems."

The way i try to remember it is (natives, please correct me if I'm wrong!)
- het woord + een -> zonder 'e' 
- end of sentence? -> zonder 'e'
In other cases i add 'e' to the descriptive words.

So much good luck!"
