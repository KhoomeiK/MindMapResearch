SuicideWatch,f8d2pnd,t3_e09a1h,1574476513.0,At least you have someone by your side that genuinely cares about you. I have nothing. You don’t realise how lucky you are it’s not worth it
BreakUp,f7z54fu,t1_f7z3h4r,1574105450.0,I know and at the end of the day you can’t make someone love you. I just wish they would say things earlier so you could at least see if it’s something you can work on together. Life can be the worst sometimes especially when you feel like they’re the one. Idk about your relationship but mine was perfect like it just always felt so right and we never fought and then her depression came in and out of nowhere just called the whole thing off and moved on like it was nothing. I just wish she told me earlier rather than put me through that because she always says how it’s not me but idk what to believe anymore. I hate that she’s also suffering. Life can be so cruel :’(
BreakUp,f7yxsm9,t3_dy3ual,1574102310.0,I’ve had that so many times and it’s not fair. It leaves you questioning for the rest of your life. Was everything just a lie? Did they ever love you? How can you do that to someone. Make them feel so worthless and unloved. After everything you’ve been through together. How can you just throw away something like that?
BreakUps,f7s43kt,t1_f7s1kxi,1573990745.0,Thank you. It’s just the fact that she said she doesn’t want to string me along and that it’s very one sided which isn’t fair as it might not ever happen between us and it hurt because it made it seem like she had already given up on a future. As far as I am aware we are just friends now but I know she goes out a lot and she’s really vulnerable and I don’t want her to do anything stupid which considering she has 0 feelings for me it’s a lot easier to. It just feels like she’s throwing everything away. Even though it’s not her fault. Sorry if it sounds controlling but I just want the truth and I saw something that looked like a hickey on her. Otherwise I wouldn’t feel this way at all.
BreakUps,f61v5jx,t1_f5z54fd,1572647850.0,Thanks I’ll defo take that advice

BreakUp,euxgmd0,t3_chs244,1564087298.0,Being replaced is one of the worst feelings ever. There is no good reason for it. Feelings change people meet other people. Clearly he’s just not worth it and you’ll find someone better. But there’s a way to go about these things to at least make it as easy as possible for the other person but people care more about themselves and he should at least consider that you really cared about him. It also means he never really cared if it’s so easy for him which you don’t deserve. I’m so sorry.

Psychedelics,euc1js5,t3_cfr0k9,1563662533.0,How is that even a thing. It’s literally impossible for DMT to be a “drug problem” maybe psychogically addictive but even still
BreakUp,eubx4tr,t3_cfqta1,1563659229.0,One thing I learnt the hard way is that feelings change. It doesn’t make any sense but it happens like that it’s happened to me so many times from one day “you’re my whole world” and the next complete strangers. You can’t force feelings so if its meant to be it will be. There isn’t really much you can do but work on yourself and hope it works out because it seems like he’s going through some personal problems of his own. If he said he still loves and misses you it’s defo a good sign but no promises. All I can say is defo keep yourself open and never be too attached to anyone even if you think they’re the one. There’s always gonna be someone else out there that you might even have more of a connection with so either way it’s a win win. If you have to change yourself for someone it’s not worth it so like only convert to Judaism if you really want to. But the most important thing is you do your thing and what makes you happy and everything will fall into place.
ForeverAlone,eub4kbu,t3_cfllh6,1563639516.0,I know exactly how that feels especially since I had an opportunity again after 2 years of being lonely which ended so quickly. Then another opportunity which just went to shit and now I’m lonely again and probably gonna be lonely for another 2 years. Least you had the courage to go to a bar by yourself. I could never do that.
BreakUp,eub441s,t3_cfff6c,1563639214.0,It’s the worst thing when someone just switches on you like that. But tbh count yourself lucky because you deserve better than a toxic piece of shit like that. Just know your own worth when it’s hard and be with someone who sees your worth. He’ll be sorry when you meet someone 10x better.

BreakUp,etqt3x8,t3_ccnf8e,1563101082.0,I think there’s nothing worse. It’s like getting 1 Million Pounds one day and then it gets taken away from the very next day.
BreakUp,etfhvt3,t1_etfgtao,1562770032.0,I know. Things like that can shatter your whole reality. It’s like when someone you known your whole life just dies. I’ve had that problem myself and I saw a YouTube video about a guy loosing a lot of stuff that made me feel less alone. I’ve had friends I’ve known for years turn their back on me. I lost all my creative work which was my career. I lost my confidence. The final peace of that puzzle  was losing my girl. What hurt me the most was loosing myself. Sometimes without our control things like that happen and maybe leaving you was the only option for her. But it goes to show what type of person you are and what type of person she is when it comes down to it. You deserve someone who’d stick by you no matter what. At the end of the day if she cheated she was always gonna cheat. She never planned on staying. Making friends is a lot easier but friends don’t cut it for me. I need someone to cuddle and shit.
SuicideWatch,etfgpjl,t3_cbbowo,1562769271.0,I feel that. But I hope or at least feel like it’s when you have a blissful dream. Where you just feel so free and light and like you’re just jumping from place to place going with the flow of it all and anything you desire just comes to you. I don’t believe the consciousness dies but sometimes it can feel like whatever’s on the other side can’t be anything as bad as being alive or sometimes even worse...
BreakUp,etfg42c,t1_etffg6h,1562768878.0,I see. I’m the same I really struggle as well and it feels like it’s a miracle when a girl even talks to me again (I went 2 years without getting with a girl and recently after that gap 3 months) so things can get better. I forgot to mention that all you can do is accept what you’ve done wrong and least you know because you won’t make that mistake again. Please do me a favour and  try to cut her out because looking at her social media always backfires believe me on that one and it’s just gonna make you come up with even worse scenarios. If you love someone you let them be. Everyone’s free until they choose themselves to be with you. I’ve done stupid things too and blame myself for it but the fact you can realise your own mistakes and own it shows you have a good heart.
BreakUp,etf8r6k,t3_cbcp7z,1562763564.0,I was in a similar situation in the fact that she lied to my face. Slept with someone else behind my back. Left me for them and never ever gave me a reason why. It would play in my head everyday to the point where I wanted to take my own life. I felt humiliated and worthless and like a cuck. There’s nothing I could do literally the only thing getting me through it is by talking to other girls and having my revenge by realising she was never worth it and that someone’s gonna come along and treat you how you deserved to be treated. You just won’t care anymore and you’ll find someone who likes you more than you like them for once and you’ll have all the power so you don’t have to feel so helpless all the time. Fuck getting hurt again. Don’t trust anyone so easily and always have your guard up. You got out luckily and honestly I know you can’t help the feelings at the moment but forget about this girl you don’t deserve any of that bullshit and she doesn’t deserve you. I hope she comes crawling back to you when you meet someone better off. Then she’ll be sorry. Also the fact you said the spark had died shows that obviously she wasn’t the one for you. Get someone who makes you happy. Honestly not worth being with someone who will just selfishly drop you like that and instead of leaving you would rather immaturely cheat and destroy and scar you emotionally just for their own sake shows she never cared or respected you because I don’t know about you but if you’re like me I’d never throw something away like that especially if I cared about someone and thought they cared about me too. The fact she knows you care about her is even worse. People like that make me sick and I hope it happens back to them tenfold.
BreakUp,etf83wh,t1_etehbg2,1562763037.0,That’s just toxic and manipulative behaviour fuck that. You literally can’t make someone feel a certain way. They’ve gotta want to otherwise it’s just sad and pathetic and not worth it

BreakUp,et507op,t1_et3g9jr,1562461271.0,I don’t believe in that tbh you can’t change how a person feels I’ve said all I needed to say and she’s told me how she feels. I’m just gonna leave her be and live her own life. Literally pestering her and being clingy only gonna make things worse. Believe me I tried fighting because I couldn’t accept it the first time and it just made things 100% worse. If she really wants me she will message me again. If she doesn’t then it’s her loss and sadly mine too. Nothing changes the fact it hurts so much and there’s nothing I can do. Just try and keep the will to live even tho things are hopeless. Thanks anyways

BreakUp,et2fxt0,t3_c9oko9,1562416244.0,You can’t help the way you feel it’s the worst. Maybe he genuinely isn’t ready for a relationship. But idk the situation like is he saying that but then also talking to other girls because if he’s not gonna wait for you then you should never wait for him. All I can say is if you want a relationship now then all you can do is move on and meet someone else that is also ready for a relationship. What’s meant to be will be. If you really feel like he’s the one then you would have to wait but that doesn’t mean to turn down any other opportunities you get. At the end of the day weather he means to or not he’s playing with your feelings and emotions and it’s not worth the torture. So do what’s best for you.
