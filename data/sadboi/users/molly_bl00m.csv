If, say, you put too much on the foil and there‚Äôs a little ‚Äúbeetle‚Äù leftover but no more room to smoke it (I love that word for it from the other user who replied to you!), I go ahead and just pluck the little guy off and smoke that on a new square of foil. 

And if by run-off you are referring to the trail left behind on the foil, that is just waste and no longer smokeable (unlike what you‚Äôd find at the bottom of a well-used bowl for weed - fuck, it‚Äôs been so long I totally forgot what that‚Äôs called...) 

RESIN - so no, the trail left behind (at least from smoking tar) is NOT like weed resin and should be tossed out with the used foil.

Edit: There are instances where the run-off hasn‚Äôt been entirely smoked, actually. In my case w BTH, if it‚Äôs still shiny/maybe even a bit bubbly, there‚Äôs still something there for me to smoke and I run over it one last time. But if the trail is entirely matte black/ashy-looking, then it‚Äôs done all it can for me.

Edit 2: I usually don‚Äôt worry about going over the trail again because I tend to save my used foils for when I‚Äôm in a bind and need to stretch what little dope I have left until I‚Äôm able to pick up again - those little spots of half-smoked dope are potential lifesavers (the irony of that statement is not lost on me). BUT if you live with others/don‚Äôt have a super secure hiding spot for them, I do NOT recommend keeping that evidence around. You might be able to spin a lie to a more naive/willfully ignorant person that you were smoking hash off the foil, but why run the risk of needing to cover a lie with more lies?

opiates,fhh16aq,t3_f37maj,1581588893.0,"I‚Äôve always preferred smoking for a number of reasons, and I just use foil, a trusty Bic lighter, and a piece of straw with just the right diameter (both too small and too big won‚Äôt allow for the necessary suction). 

Cut a square of foil, flatten it out completely so the dope can freely run across it (I use the lighter to aid in this step), then put a small amount in one corner of the foil. 

I‚Äôve seen a variety of ways to actually do it, but I personally stick the straw in my mouth, have the lighter in my left (non-dominant) hand and hold the foil with my right (dominant) at an angle so that the dope runs down as it ‚Äúmelts‚Äù or however you wanna put that. 

Hold the flame close enough to the foil to light the dope but do not let the flame actually touch it (this will make it burn unnecessarily fast + possibly ignite/burn it and your straw). I find it easiest to keep the lighter stable/steady and move the foil along the flame as you inhale (again, keep the straw close enough to capture the smoke but not so close as to possibly melt it). I like to move along the edges from the outside-inward, making a squared spiral of sorts. 

It will take some trial-and-error to find what works best for you, and despite everyone who will cry over the waste it‚Äôs still a better alternative to the needle (health-wise, that is).

Edit: ONE LAST THING - you place the dope on the dull side of the foil and hold the lighter to the shiny side!"

Lowering the birth rates of poorer nations thru family planning and better healthcare/education, however, is definitely an issue of immediate concern, both beyond and definitely because of climate change.

My best friend and I were always considered the two most gifted students in grade school, but my motivation started dwindling around 6th grade (beginnings of mental illness with puberty now brewing). However, I had always loved reading and writing and was a HUGE Harry Potter fan. 

We had to write a book report, so I spent hours upon hours at the family computer writing an 11 page book report on The Chamber of Secrets. I always got A‚Äôs on essays, but when this came back I received a B-. I was fucking PISSED because I actually poured my heart n soul into the assignment and went above n beyond the requirements, so I took it to our 7th grade English teacher demanding an explanation. 

That‚Äôs when she told me there was no way in hell someone my age wrote something that long and that well thought-out by myself. I threatened to bring my mom in to complain because she witnessed me slaving away at the computer all week (and this was a private Catholic school so that actually meant something), so to avoid that she grabbed my paper, quickly crossed the - to turn it into a B+, and told me to go sit down. Instead of getting my mom involved, I just gave up on that class for good. Later in the year I wasn‚Äôt paying attention and she patronizingly tried getting me to participate by using Harry Potter-related examples to illustrate the concepts. 

The next year I won some money and was published in the LA Times for winning a kids environmental writing contest I had entered, had some poetry published in a kids‚Äô collection, and was also kept in during one recess where all the teachers ganged up on me to tell me I needed more God in my life and was going nowhere fast. Fuck that school.
