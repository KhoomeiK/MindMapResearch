cocaine,fqky8yy,t1_fqkxxj6,1589439920.0,"That’s fuckin awesome I spend 100$ like 30mins ago and I got what we call a party pack in my area (idk if that’s a universal term) which is supposed to be 1.5g but it looks pretty much equal to that, maybe just a little bit more. I can’t complain tho cuz i got some new shit they just got and it’s like double or triple the strength it was last time I picked up from them so it doesn’t take nearly as much to get me zoomin :)"
cocaine,fqkxvys,t3_gjezwl,1589439593.0,"I wish the dealers in my area had weights like this to me this looks like way more than a gram, I must have shitty dealers, either that or yours are hooking you up."
cocaine,fq5bamy,t1_fpm4ei0,1589098899.0,"So not that much less still a decent amount, I think it might maybe be that I’m expecting too much out of the snow like possibly it doesn’t always have to be an absolutely intense euphoric rush of ecstasy and bliss."
bipolar,fp8tozn,t1_fncmv9n,1588402645.0,"Thats pretty hectic, I had a girl come into the dining hall and say there’s gonna be a mass suicide this is the last supper and another guy told me Donald trump paid for bone implants in his legs so he could be taller."
bipolar,fp8thet,t1_fndznic,1588402447.0,I take 15mg of Dexedrine in the morning and 15mg Olanzapine at night.
bipolar,fnbq27q,t3_g0ozuc,1586820082.0,"I have the same irrational paranoia and it used to be way worse medication helps me keep it somewhat manageable but without the meds I lived in colossal paranoia 24/7 and 10/10 would not recommend that, it’s no way to live IMO trying meds is something I’m very happy I did it made life manageable once I found the right things, it’s not perfect but it definitely helps. Getting the right meds can take a while for some but I would definitely say that trying meds and sticking it out to find something that works helped me a lot and I hope other people find solutions to help them cuz symptoms of bipolar can be debilitating and the only help I can vouch for is meds in my experience anyway.
Paranoia has made me do lots of things I regret and made me miserable for many years in the past and I can’t repair some of the things I’ve done completely but luckily I’ve found a way to help prevent issues, I hope you find something that works."
bipolar,fnbo9v2,t3_g0sppe,1586819114.0,"I had hypo escalate to full blown mania, then my family sent me to the hospital this was all on Thursday. The nurse assessed me and gave me olanzapine and two ativans I fell alseep in a normal hospital room and woke up in the psych ward now it’s been four days and I should be getting out tomorrow my psychiatrist is here 9am tmmrw so I get re assessed and provided my current state I should be discharged. My nurse told my mom I would’ve been out on Friday but it was a long weekend so I had to wait for the psychiatrist that assessed me initially so that’s why I’m still here.

Update: I did get out the day after and then later had a video call with a psychiatrist they connected me with. He diagnosed me bipolar type 1 and recommended I continue the meds I was given there like and its been helping tremendously I feel content and calm and my symptoms of bipolar are very minimal :)"
bipolar,fmqopjf,t1_fkzx0ir,1586303828.0,I wholeheartedly agree! my mania has been escalating the longer I’m inside and it’s getting pretty odd being isolated to such a small space and practically alone but manic af!
bipolar,fmqnyjh,t1_fmkswag,1586303391.0,"I am on cipralex 20mg when I started that i was just on Dexedrine XR 15mg for adhd and then they gave me that for depression, after that I had more manic episodes until I realized that I had issues and saw a dr and I was diagnosed bipolar 1 and put on risperidone 1mg daily which helped a little then , dr added seroquel 75mg daily and finally added topiramate 100mg daily then to quit smoking I was also put on Bupropion XL 150mg daily all of these combined kept me from severe mania and depression as well as keeping my adhd under control and helping me cut down on smoking and I functioned quite nicely with some manageable  side effects that did not bother me or effect my quality of life too much until this quarantine. Now I’ve been inside for weeks, haven’t changed any medication but feel like they aren’t enough right now under the circumstances of isolation and lack of usual behaviours critical to my mental health like socializing and going outside. I feel myself rapidly escalating towards what feels like my first manic episode in months maybe a year, anyhow I plan to see my dr or psychiatrist about this issue soon. If I were you I’d seek the advice of a medical professional, I try to remind myself that they usually have a clearer picture of the solution due to them usually being a medically trained person and typically not suffering from possibly altered states consciousness. (I say that with my situation and experiences in mind and in no way mean any disrespect or to assume anything about you or your experiences)"
ChildrenofAddicts,fmn517c,t3_e21a4y,1586218350.0,"While reading your post I come to realize there are other people who deal with the same kind of issues as me. While it is comforting to know that others struggle like me and I’m not just uniquely weak, it’s unfortunate that you’ve have had difficult experiences because of a mother addict too. My mom has been a heroin addict since I was 6. I had the same problem with mom always sleeping, it left me responsible for the feeding and caring of my brothers. I eventually realized why things were the way they were and what her paraphernalia was and when my dad was in town for a few days I told him mom was on drugs and where she hid them. She was outed and my childhood collapsed as my mother went to a rehab for a day then she left the program, my dad, my brothers, and me. I was so lost, for a long time I believed that I had fallen and hit my head before mom began drugs and I’d been in a coma living out this nightmarish reality since then. I hoped that to be real and actually believed legitimately it could be the logical explanation for my life until I was 15. Presently I’m 18 and I have the new issue of my mom asking for money every so often. If I didn’t know without a shred of a doubt that it was going to heroin and/or crack I’d be more than happy to help her, but if I give her the 20$ 80$ 100$ etc. (the amount depends on how much she thinks I have) I hear her call the dealer, see her buy it, and see her do it she doesn’t hide what she does from me or my brothers and family. So I don’t like to give her money and when I get the courage to say no I have maybe a little different but kinda similar problems: she guilts me, makes me feel like she does everything for me and I’ve never repaid her, assigns $ values to things she’s done for me like I’m in Financial debt for the times she’s acted like a mother towards me, if I say no she says never to ask for anything again because I’m ungrateful and never do anything for her which isn’t true. And I also worry about my relationship with her and worry that if I don’t help her or do the right things I may have guilt or regret if something were to happen to her because of drugs like an overdose. You get the idea I’m sure, it all hurts and it’s easier to give in sometimes to all the manipulative behaviours and justifications and everything but I try to stay strong and realize that making myself and my wellbeing a priority is not wrong or selfish no matter what she may say because if I make her addiction and self interest priority then I won’t be taking care my life and my wellbeing and my issues will get worse and I won’t be able to succeed and achieve my goals and I can’t be held responsible for her actions because I have no control over them and so I must let go and stop trying to fix her because only she can do that and it will only bring me great stress and negativity to actively try and watch her suffer and fail. So I take care of my health, happiness, and sobriety above all else, and i detach from stressing about issues if I’m powerless over because my reaction won’t change the outcome so my time is better spent changing the things I can in my life. I’ve struggled with my vices and mental health, but I’ve improved a lot and it’s getting better and I hope you too can find relief from the difficulties that come with what you are going through cuz you and I both deserve to be successful in life we have had to work hard and be strong. In the wild the parents of animals defend their vulnerable young from the dangers and predators of volatile animal kingdom and humans are the most intelligent animal alive. It’s lonely scary road to walk when you’re young and left to face the reality and dangers of the world yourself while you’re still vulnerable and you become old enough to deal with reality by necessity prematurely and suffer the consequences later on as you age."
cocaine,flf1f32,t3_fof2ba,1585095907.0,"IMO, If you’ve never done coke ? Half a gram’ll get you buzzing pretty nice you’ll feel something for sure, unless you’ve got absolutely terrible coke.
If you HAVE done coke? Half a gram just reminds you that coke feels great but half a gram is nothing and it’s already gone and you’re left wondering if you have enough money for more."
cocaine,flf0bst,t1_flezd0n,1585095228.0,I second that
cocaine,flerfp6,t3_fnv2a5,1585090024.0,Yeah it’d been a while since I’d even done some blow then quarantine comes around and boredom sets in and all of the sudden I’ve already almost finished a .5 of the 1.5g I just picked up and I’m already thinking I might as well grab an 8ball later tonight to stock up before my area is on lockdown
