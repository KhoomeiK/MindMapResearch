AskWomenOver30,fr13k7f,t3_gm2fzk,1589812574.0,"I think gender has very little to do with. If you spend enough time reading about dead bedrooms, you‚Äôll see that it impacts women just as much as men. For me, my dead bedroom boiled down to key differences in attachment styles. My husband is avoidant and I‚Äôm anxious. I need sex to feel close and reassured, all the while it can make an avoidant person feel smothered. In my opinion, a dead bedroom is a symptom of a problem but isn‚Äôt the real problem."

Eugene,fj456z9,t1_fj3xl9f,1583000542.0,"My sows and boars are much older than that. And they live a great life. I respect people that choose not to eat meat, but I wish you would direct your efforts more towards the inhumane factory farmed animals. Not hear to argue fundamental beliefs with anyone, just trying to give people who eat meat a local option for responsibly raised meat. 

My sows have one liter of piglets a year and get to roam around the farm to their hearts content. They naturally wean their piglets, and aren‚Äôt separated at 3 weeks like most commercially raised animals. They give birth in a nest that they build, not restricted in a farrow cage. My piglets don‚Äôt get the tails docked or needle teeth removed. All of my animals live on pasture,  not on concrete."
Eugene,fj44qdf,t1_fj0grwa,1583000240.0,"I notice a taste difference between my pork and store bought. My pigs are fed a corn and soy free ration and that is primarily what store bought pigs are fed. The taste of pork is influenced by the breed of the pig, what it is fed, and how it is raised. My pigs move around and exercise all day compared to commercially raised pigs that are raised in massive barns filled with thousands of other pigs. I‚Äôve never had Vietnam pork, so I don‚Äôt have any additional insight there."

Farmers Helper is the best option there is in the area IMO. Extremely clean set up and my customers think they have the best bacon, ham, and sausage. 

If real ingredients instead of spice packets matter to you, Revel Meats/Marks Meat in Canby offers the most options. I find their sausages to be a bit dry for my liking."

Portland,f9uxmwx,t3_e72ien,1575659531.0,"I bought goats to clear my 80 acres. They work great for land clearing but can be hard to contain. After they finish munching all the edible stuff, it usually requires some human labor to finish the job. Many ornamental landscaping plants like azaleas and rhododendrons are extremely poisonous to goats, but the company should be aware of those and be able to discuss a mitigation plan. 

Westside Goat Girl and Healing Hooves both offer goat grazing services locally. I‚Äôve never used either of them but have heard good things about both. 

Good luck and enjoy the adorable lil‚Äô workers if you follow through with it."
