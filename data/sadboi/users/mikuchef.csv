learnprogramming,ewa5yq5,t3_cnbgqu,1565237196.0,"To be honest just learn it with commitment, learn it with the thought that you are going to be good at it soon and that you will be able to make or develop whatever it is that you want soon. Self belief and consistency play a big roll here. To be honest, yea its a good way to learn with something that will engage you, but in coding and programming you literally need patience and practice. People literally quit when something is not engaging them at some point, and I get that, we all want something that will keep us on our tippy toes but to he honest being good at the “boring” stuff and really understanding why something is the way it is, thats what will make you a good programmer. You will be able to solve problems then. We all hate when we don’t understand something, Its just the human nature, thats why a lot of people say they hate math. But when you understand it, its fun and it makes you feel good. You just have to work to understand it. Thats whats important. Working to understand stuff. And also Just working with the thought of “when I understand this, I will be able to do this.” And for the hundredth time, ANYONE CAN BE A PROGRAMER, CODER! ITS ALL UP TO YOU IF YOU WANT TO LEARN A NEW SKILL AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE PATIENCE AND IF YOU’RE GONNA GIVE IT YOUR ALL, AND IF YOU ARE AT ALL INTERESTED IN COMPUTERS OR CREATING STUFF WITH YOUR CREATIVE MIND. EVERYONE HAS THE ABILITY TO LEARN! AND PROGRAMMING IS LITERALLY LEARNING SOMETHING NEW.  just know that if there is a will there is a way."
depression,evwcdpj,t3_clhszv,1564860564.0,"It depends what you are working hard on. If its your passion, lets say you want to be a dancer, and if you believe in yourself enough to think that you will be a professional one day then hard work plays a part in this. There is a lot of sacrifice and a lot of work you need to do in order to achieve it.  Same goes for school, if you want to get a 4.0 gpa or higher and get scholarships, that doesn’t come with luck, it comes with hard work. But when it comes to certain hardships in life like going through depression, hard work is not the right way or word to describe how to overcome it. There are spectrums in depression and depending on what spectrum you are in, all that matters is that you take baby steps and going on step at a time. Its your pace."
