Anxiety,fkwlzoe,t3_fl4ohb,1584596767.0,"Hey hey, you, relax. Sit down. Take a deep breath. Breathe in counting to 4. Hold it for 4. Exhale for four. I have been having anxiety about the whole thing too. You are not the only one. I promise you. Even people I know who do not have the disorder we have and are more resilient are under a high amount of stress. It’s gonna be okay. I have a friend of a friend who knows an epidemiologist and he said that as long as people follows the social isolation, the spread should slow radically and we will be okay. The sooner they slow it down the sooner we can all go back to our normal lives. What are some things you like to do inside your home when you’re not being told to quarantine? I think the word itself, or the phrase social isolation, scares people more than then quarantine. If you think about it, it’s what most people have been asking, time with family, a break from work, etc. we have to look at the positive side of it. Stay away from social media and the news. Think about what you enjoy to do. You can even start getting your mental health in order by journaling, reflecting, do a mindfulness worksheet and perhaps meditate. I know it’s hard. I go back and forth too but I try to just focus on my kids. You can still go outside, just not around people. If it’s sunny, just sit outside. Or in your backyard."

Anxiety,ettxdef,t3_cdhppr,1563198787.0,"I’ve gone on a road trip that was 16 hours away. The first time I did it, I was having major anxiety for the first two hours. I learned to just let the adrenaline come and go. It was uncomfortable for sure, but after it burned, the rest of the trip was much easier. Is there anything you like to do that can distract you? A good book?"
Anxiety,etqldo4,t1_etqkvvh,1563090318.0,"Read it over and over until the adrenaline burns, I promise, the more you accept the thoughts with acceptance, the faster they leave. Don’t worry about the sleep you’re getting, that will cause your brain to keep stressing. I tend to read stuff about space, or look at funny subreddits until I feel the tiredness."
Anxiety,etqkbwq,t3_cd01wu,1563088888.0,"Let the thoughts come and stay. As intense as they are, as scary as they seem, they are nothing but thoughts. It’s your brain’s way of being anxious just like the heart racing, fingers tingling, vision tunneling, intrusive thoughts are your brain’s way. Let them come with no judgment. Sit with the thoughts. You’ll find your slumber eventually."
