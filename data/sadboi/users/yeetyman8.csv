And it's really weird because the sound changes slightly (getting lower or higher) depending on what's on screen. It's a really high pitch sound so it isnt always noticable and I'm not sure if it's from the fans or from the gpu itself. If I get any more info on this I'll post it here to help, and if you get any more info it would help MILES to know."

I can undervollt and underclock higher end hardware and get better temps and longer battery at the downside of slightly worse performance. On the other hand if you try to overclock an i5 9300h to higher speeds you'll get worse thermal  performance, and thermal throttling, as it is on 14nm."

I'm looking for something I could easily take around and doesnt get me odd looks with the cringey gaming laptop black and red look. I'm alright with spending the extra bit to for a better looking device. And I already have had bad experiences with Msi's customers support. So I may just take U/NoctisFs's advice as the ga 502du does check all these boxes so Im thinking I may go with that.
