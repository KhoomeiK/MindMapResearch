AskReddit,foj0nlh,t3_g7id84,1587803729.0,"Gore is often easy, cheap, it doesn't make me *scared*, just disgusted. I'm not watching a horror movie to feel disgusted, I want to be scared, creeped out. I love psychological horrors, or those who build on atmosphere, that get under your skin... Of course, there can be some body horror and when done well, it only adds to the movie. But I really don't need excessive gore or movies that are solely built on the physical. Also, now that I'm at it, jumpscares can be done incredibly well and really really work to enhance the experience, but sadly way too often it's just a cheap way to startle you. If I jump up because you suddenly blasted the sound effects/music and something jumped out at me on the screen, that's not an achievement, it's a natural physical response and it doesn't mean I'm scared. There's such a big difference between getting startled and being genuinly scared/uneasy. Making a good psychological horror is much more difficult, but damn, those movies are great.

Most recent example of a perfectly unsetlling film (so much so that I almost turned it off halfway through) with really amazing work with atmosphere and the viewer's psychology, with some very effective body horror and virtually no jumpscares: Midsommar."

I'm sorry you're going through that. Physical health doesn't always have to be connected to mental health, and the fact that you aren't feeling tired *physically* doesn't in any way invalidate the mental fatigue you're experiencing. It can be connected to all kinds of mental health issues (some that I have at least some second-hand experience with are depression and various kinds of (social) anxiety, but I'm definitely not saying it has to be one of those things...). I don't know you nor am I a professional in any way, so I'm not going to try and diagnose you, but just know that you're not alone in feeling that way. If you can, I recommend trying to talk to a professional about how you feel. They could help you in figuring out what's going on and in dealing with it going forward. I know that's kind of challenging right now, but maybe you can at least find some form of online therapy or something like that... Obviously that's up to what options you have and what you feel comfortable with.

In any case, I hope you figure it out and find your peace. Try to be kind to yourself and don't push yourself too hard... sometimes some things just become really difficult to near impossible, and it doesn't mean that we've lost our talents or that we're incapable. Don't beat yourself up for feeling a certain way or not being able to do something you used to be able to do, give yourself space and time. I wish I could be of more help..

His style will not appeal to everyone, maybe it takes a few listens sometimes (also definitely try multiple songs, the style kind of varies; some are more serious, some are just silly, lot of it is about finding joy in the little things of everyday life... but there's a bit of everything), but it's the most uplifting, wholesome, comforting music I know. It feels like a hug, like everything is gonna be okay. There are songs that always make me smile. It always makes me feel better and helps me through the day.

I can't possibly pick a representative sample, so let me try to make some categories... if something captures your attention, go for it :)

*Silly/fun:* Away With The Fairies, Watermelon, P.A.S.T.A., Hey Louis Don't Bite Me (it's about Suarez haha), Phone Battery Dead (this song was an April Fools joke, it's a mess lol), The Only Good Thing About Bad Bob (wasn't sure where to put this one but wanted to put it somewhere...)...

*Uplifting/reassuring:* Soon Soon, Don't Die Curious, Take Your Guess, Big Pot of Hummus, Love Loosens Limbs, Fenn, Little Big Mistakes, Don't You Know How Busy and Important I Am, If We All Die Tomorrow (I know the title sounds incredibly inappropriate now lol, I swear the song is very positive; if, however, you don't feel like listening to something with that subject matter, that's totally valid!! ...I should also mention that the song was written before all this madness and has nothing to do with it... heh)...

*Sweet/comforting/love/closeness:* Cos Love, Middle of My Mind, Hugging You (both versions), Keep Me Warm, Forests, Future Holds, Us, For You to Be Here, It's Been a Year, It's Ok, Go Solo, You Only Need You (both versions), Gone Gone, Just As, Lead Me to You, Panda in the Chandellier (such a sweet lighthearted song.. hard to classify), Let It Out...

Also I really recommend checking it out on YouTube. He works with many amazing artists and his music/lyric videos are always beautiful. He does have most songs on Spotify too though.

tipofmytongue,flcx4ky,t3_fnvktg,1585049980.0,"Man! I have a memory of this music video that would fit your description perfectly! Some more I can remember: I think it was like a ""brutal anti-love/falling out of love/getting over someone therapy"" - a guy was forced to watch someone (I think they were also trying to make him do it himself, which he did by the end) destroy things connected to his (former) love (I suppose?) and stuff like that, like ripping apart a teddy bear and other things... maybe stabbing smething, some hearts (not like actual hearts, I mean heart-shaped... things)...? There might have been some punching (like a teddy bear with a picture of the ex's face on it or sth? But I might be making that up). I remember it feeling kind of brutal, because the guy in question was very uncomfortable and like resisting in a way? It was super hard for him. It was played off like getting over an addition or sth, and it was very exaggerated. It was like ""trying to cure love"", in a quite violent way. I'm also pretty sure that the person making him do the things was wearing either a suit or a doctor's clothes. I remember some more imagery that's hard to verbalize (also I'm not sure how authentic it is...). Do you think it could be it?? I can't remember the song and I can't find it, but I feel like it was somewhat popular back then...? I definitely saw it on TV (it was on a Czech music channel tho). I'll definitely keep looking, cos now it's bugging me too lol.

Edit: I'm also pretty sure it was a male singer. I'm thinking the guy in the video could've been like. Adam Levine type? But I might just be mixing it up with Animals. It's blurry.."
mentalhealth,fl49np3,t3_fmek48,1584808932.0,">Not educated others just telling them to not be stigmatizing 

>stigmatizing people who dont understand about mental disorders 

I really agree with these two. I totally understand where it's coming from, but I hate how some people bash others and make them feel stupid or like they're a terrible person for not understanding something. While it is so for some of us, mental health issues are not an everyday reality for many people (and frankly, I'm happy for them). If they have no experience with it, it's no wonder they don't understand and maybe believe some of the stigma/stereotypes... that's when we have to come in. Sometimes we just don't have the mental capacity to do that and that's valid, but it would be so helpful if when someone says something seemingly insensitive or igonrant, if instead of an avalanche of downvotes and derogatory and berating comments they received an actual patient explanation... *That's* the only way to actually make a difference in the world, I believe... Those of us who can, please try to hold back your anger... These situations so often stem from misunderstanding and lack of knowledge. It of course doesn't entitle people to be hateful and insensitive, but maybe we can change that stance, at least for some. It's so important to educate with correct information, not just tell them that they got it wrong."

DissociativeIDisorder,fk6xzu8,t1_fk6jgde,1583921050.0,"I'm sorry, but no, I don't think so. I understand why you're feeling the way you are, it makes perfect sense, it's natural to be confused, scared, angry... But trying to force your alters out, force sensitive information out of them and then shove them away does not sound like a good idea, it's very destructive and will most likely end up backfiring badly on you. It will hurt them as well as you. Of course I can't diagnose you, but if you do have DID/OSDD and these are your alters, they aren't just some figments of your imagination that you can block out. The more you try to block them out, the angrier they will get. It hurts them. I bet they want to be heard. I want to also say that fear is totally understandable, but primarily alters are here to help you. They can each have different methods of doing that, and sometimes it needs to be worked on with a therapist, but bottom line is they exist for a reason, they helped you survive, you're all parts of one whole.

And on a sidenote, I totally understand your desire to know, but let me just say that there is a good reason why those alters exist and why they hold memories you don't remember... It's probably not a good idea to try to pry them out of them. I would personally recommend trying to work on this with a therapist, they can recommend the best course of action a thousand times better than a random person on the internet who's never met you. The trauma memories can come back once your brain decides you're in a safe enough space that you can know them. And it's also perfectly possible to do trauma work with your terapist if you feel that that's what you need/want. Everyone has different needs and a different path to healing. But just as a general rule (and just so you know, I'm not a professional in any way, this is just what I've learned from other DID/OSDD systems), I wouldn't try to force the information out.

Even if you don't have a therapist right now, or are not ready to bring this up with them, there are other things you can do. You can reach out to these alters. Try to open the communication gates. Show them they can trust you and you're willing to listen to them. I know it's scary. But if they feel they can trust you, if they feel heard and welcome and safe, they might come out themselves. They might communicate with you. Maybe you can start a journal, communicate with them through that... Different thing work for everyone. I just really do not recommend trying to block them out. If this is DID, it will not cause them to disappear. They're there. And they're not evil, or bad, they're not your enemies. You're on the same boat.

What you're going through can be terrifying, and I'm sorry. Just know you're not alone, there are people who can relate and hopefully help. If you'd like a safe space to ask any questions you might have and have some guidance on this difficult journey, PM me, I can link you to a great support server. Everyone there is very friendly and supportive. I'm just an ally, so I can't help you all that much, but I hope you find the support you need. Stay safe!

...And, this is a longshot, because I don't really know what kind of music you like, but I want to return the favour, so here: if you like really unique, unusual, talented bands and amazing vocal harmonies, you should really check out Steam Powered Giraffe. I was taken aback by them at first, but they're really great. Honeybee might be a good starting point. I also love Malfunction, Hot on the Trail, Latum Alterum (Ya Ya Ya), Automatic Electronic Harmonics, Starlight Star-shine, or I'll Rust with You. Give it a shot and see if it's something you enjoy!"

ifyoulikeblank,fk3xn8m,t3_ffwav7,1583848815.0,"* Little Talks - Of Monsters and Men (kind of a non-traditional duet...); also almost all of their songs have male as well as female vocals, although they're not exactly duets per se (similar thing with Rogue Valley (song: The Wolves and the Ravens)). Absolutely worth checking out, great band.

I can definitely come up with more if you like this list. These are just off the top of my head.

Also for amazing multi-vocal harmonies you can check out Steam Powered Giraffe. Honeybee might be a good starting point... I personally was introduced to them through Malfunction. A very unique, little-known band, but damn they're good.

mentalhealth,fk10idr,t1_fk0v7zo,1583770022.0,"I love this comment.

I have such a strong ""I need to fix it"" reflex, I struggle really hard to supress it. It's near impossible... Even if everything inside of me is screaming at me not to problem solve, even if I'm fully aware that it's not a great way to go about it, I often don't manage to fully keep it in. If I see someone struggling or suffering, my instinct is to do whatever I can to take that difficulty/pain away, to alleviate it, fix it. I know it's ultimately not helpful. It's just so hard to supress it. I really need to internalize this. I'm working hard on it.."
mentalhealth,fk0zimb,t3_ffribp,1583769481.0,"This was amazingly helpful. You have no idea. Many of these things I really really need to internalize. I'm saving this post and I'll read it many more times. Thank you.

I might have more questions in the future. I have plenty of people in my life with more serious struggles or mental health issues, and I don't always know what to say or do to actually help them (...and on a sidenote, I also feel like I got to a point where I need support for myself too). I tried to schedule an appointment with a therapist, but the clinic just wrote back that they're full and are not accepting any more clients."
AskReddit,fk0oaws,t3_ffrg9d,1583762329.0,"Oh man. All these responses are amazing. I'll add my two cents: The Live Aid concert in 1985 (you guessed it, especially Queen). And a Beatles concert.

These legendary bands came way before my time. It would really be something to hear them live..."
NoStupidQuestions,fjzzpjl,t3_ff9yfo,1583735317.0,"I hate feeling disappointed, and my brain will do whatever it can to evade that feeling (stupidly enough, there's also a portion of shame in it for me, like I spent money on it, I took someone with me to see it, etc., and it sucked, I kind of feel like I fell for something... idk if that makes sense). If I'm excited for the movie, I spent money to see it, etc., I'll be damned if I don't enjoy it. I basically convince myself that I liked it, or at least that it wasn't that bad, and I can only be objectively critical of it some time later, after its not so fresh.

...Obviously then there are movies that are just so bad that not even my brain can prevent me from realizing that. The last awful film exeperience like that was The Nun... but at least as soon as I realized it's not going to get any better after the first 15 or so minutes of painfully awkward dialog, I could sit back and have fun watching that trainwreck. It was hilariously bad.

Also, I think very often you can change your opinion of a film based on what other people and critics say, based on its reviews... sadly, it's a powerful thing, and even if you actually liked the movie, you will likely start seeing fault with it too if it's widely considered ""bad."" Or the reviews will make you aware of faults and mistakes you didn't notice on your own and that you now can't unsee..."

UnsentLetters,fjkgwj5,t1_fjkfmne,1583426609.0,"Yea, of course. You can't push yourself to the point of complete exhaustion or a burnout. It's important to observe your body as well as your mental state and make sure you don't exceed your limits. We all have them and it's okay. It's good to know when to rest too.

But at least for me, and speaking more generally (as in, disregarding special circumstances), I think it's good if you manage to create a schedule or plan for yourself and actually stick to it. Cause I feel that once you start breaking your own rules, it all tends to fall apart quite fast from there. At least in my experience.

UnsentLetters,fjjrcui,t1_fjjjvjs,1583409582.0,">It's ok to skip a day or two of exercise

I mean I surely agree, but I think you gotta know yourself quite well first - in my personal experience, for example, I know that if I allow myself to skip one day, then it's just a little step away from skipping two... and then three, four, until I stop coming altogether. I personally can't really allow myself to slip into the mentality that ""I don't actually have to do this if I don't want to..."" Then I gradually start to lose the resolve and willpower. But I know this is definitely different for everyone.
