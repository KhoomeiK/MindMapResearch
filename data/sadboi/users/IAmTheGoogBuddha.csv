I haven‚Äôt personally tested it, but a few people I know use a thing called Modafinil. Apparently it‚Äôs what truck drivers use to stay awake? 

Could also try something like rittalin or addaral? I‚Äôve used these recreationally a handful of times, and they work pretty well at keeping you awake. 

The only issue with these things is that they are stimulant drugs, so they have the possibility of inducing mania, especially if you‚Äôre sensitive to stimulant products. Probably best to have a chat with your doctor about your options. I suffer from pretty bad sleep apnea, so I feel your pain. A solid 8 hour sleep is really equivalent to less than 1 hour of good REM sleep for me."
