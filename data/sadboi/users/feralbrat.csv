Neither of us have ever played the games before so the mechanics are new to me.

Also it made me wait 6 minutes to reply, so.. thank you to everyone else, as well. 🖤"
AnimalCrossing,fo0fg86,t1_fo0emow,1587412162.0,"Okay, checked with sons profile and now he’s in trouble for lying to me about it. I wouldn’t have minded sharing the island, just the not telling me that he moved stuff around and such is what made me mad. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I spent several hours working on the layout the other day.

Does anyone know if we *have* to live on the same island while using the same Switch? He hasn’t gotten very far but I don’t want to have him start over if he isn’t able to choose his own island."
AnimalCrossing,fo0e6e5,t3_g4s39d,1587411439.0,"My son and I share a Switch, and two days ago he had it in the bedroom with some of his cousins. Someone moved my fences and some items around, leaving them dropped as items rather than placed, and even placed a new yellow tent? 😳🥺

No one wants to own up to it but I can’t seem to get rid of the tent either? I checked with Tom. It isn’t my campsite tent for visitors - I put that elsewhere and it’s still there. I can’t pick up anything from within the tent but I could pick up the items outside the tent. It’s in a really awful place and I want it gone but can’t figure out how. 🤦🏻‍♀️"

relationship_advice,fn7j1p7,t3_g02zqh,1586721311.0,"I think you should sit down, ask her to keep an open mind, and talk to her honestly. You know her better than we do, so this may or may not be an option, but let her know that you feel this way and are worried about how it will affect your relationship going forward. It is better to be open and honest than hide it now. 

Is there a chance she is willing to let you both explore sexually? It’s not for everyone, not even me, but it does work for some people. 🤷🏻‍♀️ And I feel like, it’s easier to try and explore other options than to call it quits and wonder for the rest of your life."
relationship_advice,fn5w3b6,t1_fn5vm0e,1586677945.0,"No, not toxic. 🙄 It mimics douching and can mess up your pH balance, as well as flush out the good bacteria that a vagina needs. It can cause yeast infections, bacterial vaginosis, and infections that may lead to infertility. Especially if you are living with several other people - bacteria can build up on the shower head.

Using water and soap to clean your labia and bikini area isn’t the same as blasting water up your vagina. Please stop pretending you know more about vaginas than people who take care of them. Thanks."
