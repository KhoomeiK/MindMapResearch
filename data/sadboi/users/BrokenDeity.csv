AskReddit,fqzha85,t3_gls61a,1589767356.0,"I sustained an injury while mountain biking that turned out to be worse than I initially thought. Long story short, I found my stolen bike a week after it disappeared, looked  like it was fine and on my way home , I was going down a hill when the back tire  hit something. The seat came off the mount and the bike ended up stabbing me in the lower back. The wound did not bleed for two weeks for one reason or another but ended up getting terribly infected.

Went to the hospital to get it looked at, the doctor introduced herself and told me she would see me in surgery first thing in the morning. So as they're cutting out an infected chunk of muscle tissue and dead skin, I have a bad reaction to the anesthesia and to quote my doctor I ""went all Return of the Living Dead"" making a low growl and attempting to crawl off the operating table.

They ended up getting me stabilized and all went back to normal. I found out after the surgery my mother on the doctor tried not to send me into a panic, but when they looked into the wound , they could see the tip of my tail bone exposed.

So I imagine that screwed up incident could have gone even worse because, yeah, they were cutting away muscle from a portion of my spine."

AskReddit,fqq2qwc,t3_gk9jew,1589558398.0," Funnily enough, the person I'm about to mention was an old customer when I worked as a cellular representative. Her name is actually Karen, and she is and always has been at least for the time I've known her, a walking variation of the meme.

Now this may get to be a bit long-winded but trust me it's worth it. Anyway, on to the incident.

About 4 months back, I stopped by the Cellular store in which I used to work in order to say hi to some of my old co-workers and upgrade my phone. Now bear in mind the place is mom-and-pop owned and has always been short-staffed, so I expected a little wait.

So there's two people ahead of me, a rather tall and stocky man in average-looking nondescript clothing and the person who met first I thought could have been her, but I wasn't absolutely sure until I heard that all-too-familiar muttering under her breath.


""This is *ridiculous!* ""Do they even know *who I am?*"" ""Always a *fucking wait* with these people!"" You know, the typical pre-entitlement tirade mantra. The guy behind her looks over his shoulder at me and just rolls his eyes. I nodded in agreement.

The representative, an Asian boy in his late teens or early twenties, and by my best estimation a relatively new employee, finished setting up the phone for the older customer he was dealing with, and beckoned her to the counter.  He's barely done asking ""how may I help you?"" Before she starts laying into him.

""I bought this phone here on Saturday and somebody  thought they were being *cute.* I can't even use this goddamn thing because all of the text is *chinky gooky blah blah bullshit!* Fucking. Fix. It. *Now!*

The kid stares at her for a second and to be quite honest, handled that far better than I would have on my best day. ""Ma'am, I'm sorry for this inconvenience. But there's no way we went into the language settings without your request first. That's one of our cardinal rules. But if you give me a second, I'll see what I can -""

""NO WAY? THAT'S COMPLETE *HORSESHIT!* It was probably *you* who set it up that way. You look like you should be able to read that ridiculous mess.""

It was at that point, my friend Lizzy, who happened to be the daytime manager, overheard her tirade. As she stood up she gave the most subtle of eye rolls because she knew who this woman was.

""What seems to be the problem Ms. Leekykunt?"" ( names changed to protect the innocent and not so innocent alike.) She asked as soon as she got over to the representative's desk.

""Yes. I was in here this past Saturday and this *prankster* decided it would be funny to set my phone to some *ching chong shit.* Fix it or give me my money back.""

Lizzy takes the phone from her and looks at it before saying. ""You know. It's pretty easy to just ask for a little help without being an out and out racist. Furthermore, there's no way he could have done anything to your phone on Saturday, because his first day on the job was *yesterday.* I'm going to help you get this phone back to English, but this is the last time this store is going to help you with anything. After today, consider yourself blacklisted.""

Obviously not liking what she heard, the Karen reverts to her other natural instinct and begins to starts screeching like a velociraptor with a hot curling iron up its ass.  

The man behind her urges her to calm down. Those of us in retail know that particular combination of words is akin to jumping into shark infested waters with a gunshot wound.

She snatches the phone out of my friend's hand and precedes to toss it on the ground like a smoke bomb in a ninja film. Glass and parts go flying everywhere.

""Now that was completely unnecessary."" Says the man as she lifts her hand into the air behind her head ala' Freddy Krueger, stretches out her spray-tanned kielbasa like fingers, and swipes her gaudy pink and gold professionally done Nails across this man's face, drawing blood in the process.

Within the blink of an eye, she's on the ground stomach down getting handcuffs slapped on her wrists. He starts reading her Miranda Rights.

Turns out, the guy standing in front of me was a plain-clothed officer who was just coming in to find a pack of screen protectors on his lunch break.

But wait. It gets better. I made it a point to make sure the kid was my sales rep. While I was talking to him about my close a decade working at that shop and informing him which customers were great and which you would have to tread lightly with, Lizzy comes out of the office.

She called the second store 20 miles up the road and spoke to our franchise owner. She went to *his* store that previous Saturday and pulled a lot of the same shit. As he was taking Sunday inventory toward the end of the day he realized one of the higher-end Samsung phones were missing.

He was in the process of reviewing security footage that Monday morning and sure enough, he saw her make her way to the restrooms while watching over her shoulder, take a hard left into the storage room which was only closed off with a curtain by the way, and walk out readjusting her oversized knock-off Gucci purse.

So yeah, ""Ms.Leekykunt"" got charged with theft, concealment, and assaulting a police officer all in the same day.

TL;DR: Karen morphs into racist Freddy Krueger over for phone's language settings, gets arrested for her efforts."

AskReddit,fqafu8l,t3_ghps6x,1589218353.0,"Right over my tailbone - I was 17 or 18 hanging out with a group of friends while hiking through the woods. We ended up going over a hill and sitting next to a tree on the ground was a BMX bike that had been stolen from me a week prior.

At first glance nothing really appear to be wrong with it. The tires are inflated, the chain was good, the brakes worked, but it was just ditched. We first made sure nobody was around, and as soon as the coast was clear, I took my bike back.

We got back to my house and a few minutes before I arrived, I've gotten the bright idea to jump the bike just to make sure it was in fact in good shape. So I set up the ramp, took my bike to the top of the hill in my backyard, got on, and started making my descent towards my makeshift ramp. And that's when it happened, my back tire hit something, I don't know if it was an errant tree root, a rock, I just know it was hard enough because the seat to fall off but leave the bracket still there. My bike bucked and stabs me just below my tailbone, right where my ass crack begins.

The damnedest thing was, it hit me in such a way *I didn't initially bleed.* so here I am, walking around for about 2 weeks not to mention biking back and forth to work on my mountain bike, and right around the 12-day mark I start experiencing this nagging pain. Nothing too bad at first just this occasional pulsating sensation. Right at the two-week Mark, I'm coming in the door from work, getting ready to go out and shoot some pool with a few of my friends when my buddy Sean turns to me and says ""dude your ass is bleeding..""

At first I thought he was screwing with me, but sure enough , I go to the bathroom to change my clothes and my work uniform khakis have a spot on the back of them the size of a small dinner plate.

I immediately go to my mom and drop trou. Without missing a beat she tells me to put on a pair of sweatpants and hop in the van, we're going to the hospital.

We're in the ER maybe a half hour – and that's stretching it. The doctor introduces herself, takes a look at my wound, and says she'll see me in surgery in the morning.

I only found out after the fact, the wound on my lower back was deep enough for my mother to stick her thumb in, horribly infected, and she could see the tip of my tail bone protruding through the muscle.

I was hospitalized post-surgery for about 3 days and pumped full of antibiotics intravenously. A mass of infected tissue and muscle the size of a golf ball had to be cut out from around the wound. The doctor told me my second day and had I let it go any longer, I could have ended up with a massive spinal cord infection. The fact that hadn't happened earlier absolutely amazed her.

So now, I have the ass of a cone head. But at least I'm not confined to a wheelchair. I guess you win some you lose some.

AskReddit,foualb3,t3_g9mmvb,1588080191.0,"OP here.  So, as I'm sure you figured out I too have a story to tell. I'm going to do my best to keep it as short as possible.

When I was 16 years old, I had a friend that was staring down homelessness. Of course, my mother and I did not want to see him living on the streets. Supposedly his parents were drug addicts and they would disappear for weeks at a time while chasing a high. We told him he had to make sure he had a job lined up and he had to take care of half of the electric bill and help with groceries.

Within five days he had a job at our local Arby's and all was well for the first four months. All of this changed when he bought a couple of pet ferrets and would bring his girlfriend around at random.

Now the thing is, he told us he was 17. He looked like he was 17. His girlfriend was 16.

He would let these ferrets run around in my room and anybody who owns ferrets knows they don't give you any warning when they've got to go to the bathroom. They just do it. I had to replace the carpet in my room because they shat everywhere. On top of that, he started locking me out of my room so he and his girlfriend could squink.. one time that I know of on my bed.

After he lost his job for being caught banging A co-worker and the janitorial closet, we kicked him out. What we didn't know was that he had a copy of the house key.

I'm at a summer camp reunion in Philadelphia and when I come home ( nearly three hours away) my back door is slightly ajar. I enter my house to find my boxer locked in the attic ( unhurt, thank God) , my bedroom door kicked in, and all of my CDs, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, games for both systems, Ibanez bass guitar, my brother's Game Boy Color, his game wallet, and some of my grandfather's stuff from his time in the military, all gone.

We file a police report and the next day we got a phone call from a friend of the family who managed a pawn shop in Atlantic City. She came in that afternoon and saw my very distinct guitar sitting at her shop. ( I was a big Type O Negative fan at the time and I painted the base of the guitar to look like the Vinnland Flag.) We told her what was going on, I honestly never thought to call her in all the confusion, and she pulled security footage.

We managed to get my CD booklet back, and the guitar, but everything else her partner took in the previous day sold.

She called the phone number he provided and told him they made a mistake with the amount of money he was paid and they owed him more. The cops were waiting and they arrested him for B&E / Selling stolen property.

It was only then, the floodgates opened up. We found out the name he'd given us was an alias, he was actually 32 years old, and he had a bench warrant in Trenton for evasion of Child Support. The girlfriend found out and went to the cops. They tacked on indecency with a minor to those charges. He ended up that charge twice because that Arby's employee was 15 and the ex-girlfriend went to the manager after going to the cops.

TL;DR help out a friend who was going to be homeless. He ended up getting kicked out of the house for  losing his job and causing hundreds of dollars in property damage. He got arrested after burglarizing and selling the items to a family friends pawn shop. Cops ended up informing us he was an adult / con artist/pedophile."

We both had problems with depression and when I started getting help she started acting like it was a threat. began treating me like crap, neglecting our son, and cheating on me with coworkers. Only found out it was multiple times after the breakup. That happened almost four years ago. I've been on one date since then and truthfully, I'm not sure if I can trust that deeply again.

relationship_advice,fnsk8zx,t3_g3oxif,1587223347.0,"38 year old guy here. I was in a couple of relationships like this in my twenties. Reconciliation is a two-way street and more often than not is a wasted effort.

You will always have that sense of doubt in the back of your mind. Does she trust me? Should I trust her? This is honestly the worst way to go about any relationship. And as far as the ""testing"" thing is concerned - could very well be a manipulation tactic. I'm not saying it is, but having gone through two different relationships in the past with girlfriends that pulled this, it sounds like it.  Just know it will eventually take a toll on you.

My advice is this, as much as it may suck now, and it will hurt, just let her go. From what I've read, I get the impression that you two are not right for each other. You're both young and still trying to figure things out. But I would take a step back and analyze the entire situation from both perspectives , yours and hers. Take the time to work on yourself. Let her do whatever she wants to do and do your best not focus on her.

Am I friends with any of my ex's? Yes, 2 as a matter of fact. But there are extenuating circumstances. The first one continued on as a friendship five years after our breakup. I ran into her, her brother, and her sister-in-law at a board gaming event. We just caught up and talked for about a half an hour. We have casual conversation every now and again and that's about it. The second ex is the mother of my child, we co-parent and being shitty towards one another is completely counter-productive.

It sounds to me like you're in the position to burn this bridge for the time being and rebuild once you two are mature enough to keep it as nothing more than a friendship.

I hope this helps, best wishes."

AskReddit,fnhtsfc,t3_g1thpq,1586968714.0,"At the time I was working in one of those ""jack-of-all-trades"" type stores. We dabbled in Verizon Wireless, sold Dish Network, sold music, and did a bit of video rental. I'm a guy, and at the time I was growing out my hair so I could donate it. For context: my sister is a cancer survivor and before I found out how they truly operated, Locks of love was a cause that was near and dear to my heart.

I've got my back turned the front door because I was running tapes through the rewinder and I had my hair pulled back in a ponytail. In walks this belligerent old man as he starts screaming about his ""*goddamn Jap made phone.*"" I politely told him I'd be with him in a second with my back still turned.

His little outburst didn't exactly make me want to rush over to help him. Not even 5 seconds later he screams at the top of his lungs ""Look LADY, I don't know where the hell your male coworker is, but you're going to turn the f*** around and help me *now.*

I turned around, and looked him dead in the face. "" look pal, *I'M* the guy you just heard and I just said I would be with you momentarily. But if you're going to act like an impudent 3rd grader with a potty mouth I'm not exactly going to rush over there and help you."" I pointed behind me towards the counter at the back of the store. ""Besides, you're in the wrong department. Verizon's in the back.."" 

He muttered something to the effect of fucking homo under his breath. He waited until he was about halfway across the store and while I didn't exactly catch everything he said at that point, the cellular manager did. She told him she wasn't going to help him if he was going to insult the employees and he could figure out how to get his phone out of Korean on his own.

As if the moment couldn't get any better, my girlfriend at the time dropped off lunch. And she never left without giving me a kiss before she went back to work herself. He saw this, and legitimately yelled ""OH, COME ON!"" Before storming out the front door.

He eventually ended up blacklisted at every store in our area. Sometimes Karma works out."

At least not without some form of counseling. There's no shame in looking into couples counseling and seeing if it helps. And if it doesn't, you may have to make a hard decision.

But I'm going to tell you something straight from the heart. I'm 38 years old, a single father, and I ignored a lot of red flags in past relationships. My self-esteem was less than dogshit.

It took losing both of my parents within 2 years of each other, the still birth of my first born son, and the eventual death the 7-year relationship with my son's mother after she began sleeping around with multiple coworkers, to start getting my head straight.

After the death of my mom, I was seeing a counselor two times a month, I literally found about my ex the day after a session. My counselor started seeing me every other week for over a year.

Do what you feel you can to better your mental state and the relationship. If it turns out the relationship isn't in the cards, do what you can to better your mental health regardless. Best of luck to you!"

Clarification: I had a job at my school as a lifeguard on Wednesday and Thursday nights. She was there with a couple of friends when one of her ex boyfriend's acquaintances saw her and threw t-shirt into the shallow end of the pool. I grabbed my spare t-shirt out of my locker and let her borrow it for the night as nothing more than an act of kindness. That was the last time I helped her out. Especially when I found out after the fact she had stalker tendencies. She found out where I lived and it would show up whenever she deemed it necessary, throwing herself at me. My home life basically left me in a state where I didn't want a relationship or intimacy and she couldn't get the clue. I eventually had to get a restraining order because I loaned out a t-shirt out of the kindness of my heart."
