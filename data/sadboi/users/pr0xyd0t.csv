hamsters,fqy02h2,t1_fqxczas,1589740442.0,Brazil. There are better pet stores but not in my city lol and we are missing on rodent stuff tbh. We have a lot more variety for other types of animals.

Walked a bit, stopped. (When it happened I was in my kitchen about to prepare chocolate milk but I couldnt even get the milk because the palpitations started.)

I wasn't sure about something, so I asked about it, and when I got the answer, i was thankful for it. That's not immature nor bad for hamster care, since i was willing to accept the criticism. There's also nothing wrong with feeding your hamsters fruits occasionally.  Also no one wants to shit on anyone here, this sub is for helping others to take better care of their hamsters, we're all learning and trying to help each other. I don't know how old you are so I'm a bit concerned about whether you're feeling nervous or something like that, but no need to take anything here personally."
hamstercare,fhqlsz3,t1_fhqkli9,1581806439.0,"I think you're being a little immature. As I said, it's normal to turn the lights on the room for a few hours during the day. It's not ideal during the night, and also you could just cover his cage if your light is too bright. Overheating can happen even outside the cage if it's glass and especially plastic- if it isnt, then there are more problems to evalue. Anyway I see no problem in using them if they aren't much colored, for a few hours a day, but keep in mind that the light only benefits you since they dont need not want it. So while it has no problem, it also makes no sense to think you're doing it for their own good. It's for you. It's okay to use if you wanna see him or do something while in his company (you'd need light to do almost anything hence why daylight is no prob), or if you wanna play with him. But the point is the light is only for your benefit, but if used correctly it shall not bring prejudice to your hamster.
Ps. Idk how old you are but usually youtubers aren't and shouldn't be taken as a definitive source especially for things as fragile as animals. Consult governmental websites, credible organizations sites, read your fonts and talk to your vet."
hamstercare,fhq9gl1,t1_fhpsfbm,1581801101.0,"It's the closeness of the light that's the problem. 

> light or light at the wrong time of day can seriously affect your hamster's mental and physical health. You should not put a light in your hamster's cage because it can pose a fire hazard, cause overheating and even burn your hamster if he remains in close contact with the light.

>Hamsters are nocturnal, and see better in the dark, so the close light would make it harder to see- and they already have poor eyesight- so sadly it’s probably not the best thing to put a LED light on top of the cage.

>I wouldn't turn the light on at night. I probably wouldn't use it at all actually. Aquarium lights tend to get very hot, and it might make it too hot in the tank. It's not worth the risk of overheating to me.

If you were to use it at night, it might keep your hamster from coming out. They prefer dim or dark homes. Having a bright light on can make them think it's daytime; thus, time for them to sleep.

These are some quotes, you can find more info with a quick search on google.

It can also seriously mess their body clock.
Also they mainly navigate by smell and hearing so it's not an improvement at all for them; and they hate to do their things in an environment with light, so if it's night, when they like to come out, it's always best to keep it dark."
