That sounds like seeing all that was terrifying, and I think most people would be feeling what you are feeling right now because of it.    


Talking to a therapist would be a great idea, I think it's really valuable to get something like this off your chest with someone who is totally outside of your family and trained to help you work through it . You are a brave person, and you deserve some peace of mind. 

Talking to your mom about it would be a great idea, let her know how you have been feeling and maybe copy paste your post and show it to her. You are very articulate.  I've been through lots of therapy, and it's been really helpful for me.
