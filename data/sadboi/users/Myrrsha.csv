I guess this is also the same with internal hallucinations associated with psychosis, but those voices have far less personality than an actual alter, and are rather one-dimensional. I experience both, in addition to racing thoughts and intrusive thoughts. It's extremely hectic.

It's important to note that it is very normal for people to talk to themselves internally, refer to themselves as ""we"" even externally, and to have several thought streams of conversation in their head; none of this is unique to DID, nor mental illness."

It should be noted that OSDD-1 does not fit quite neatly under this, but is still considered secondary. 

However, with DID, it is the tertiary structural dissociation disorder. In DID, there are many ANP and EP (again, this is sometimes present in OSDD-1, just not always, however it is not considered tertiary since it does not meet the full requirements to reach tertiary level dissociation). It can be quite confusing, but the dissociation is inherently different between DID and OSDD. Treatment is still mostly the same, as far as I am aware.

http://did-research.org/origin/structural_dissociation/secondary.html

Haunted self covers this, as do other, more recent studies. There are 3 types of structural dissociation: primary, being PTSD and simple dissociative disorders, secondary being BPD/C-PTSD/OSDD, and tertiary, DID. It goes over the creation of EP (emotional parts) and ANP (apparently normal parts), and very explicitly states that all listed disorders have EPs. All of the studies and Haunted Self are credited at the bottom. From my understanding, Haunted Self is what put this exact theory out there, which is the currently accepted module.

Now, please note that I specified a *dissociative type of PTSD*, not ALL types of ptsd, in my comment.

So, I thought this too, until I found out I was raped on a regular basis ages 8-13, along with HUGE amounts of bad, severe abuse I never remembered (my own mother was issued a communications restraining order to protect me, and that's a small example). I always knew my childhood was bad and so was my mother, but the true magnitude of what happened to me was only unveiled recently. 

I guess the difference here is, I grew up with the knowledge in the back of my head that I was abused and in an unstable home, but couldn't remember exact instances. I never even knew I was sexually abused badly for *5 years by several people.* Sometimes I still doubt it, because *how could I forget something that big?* But, it happened. That's the big thing with DID, is how much amnesia you have. Because sure, all healthy, non traumatized people don't remember their childhoods perfectly, some not at all! But the extent of dissociative amnesia is absolutely *baffling*. There's plenty you most likely don't remember! The brain is powerful.

(sorry this kinda devolved into a personal rant and I kinda forgot what I was saying... But, don't discount your experiences because you've forgotten. It will come slowly. Sorry, I'm dissociating and can't quite remember what I was talking about... But you'll be ok.)"

>have scored pretty high on the quizzes.

Online quizzes won't tell you ANYTHING. You have to be tested by a specialist, therapist, or psychiatrist because they have actual, licensed tests.

>Sometimes I hear voices that don't match up to me or anybody that I know

If it's external voices then that's psychosis. If it's internal voices then it's normal and not attributed to any mental illness.

> I don't remember a lot of my childhood and when my mom talks about me doing something and I say that I don't remember she says that I was probably too young. 

This is also normal. No one remembers their whole childhood. DID is amnesia of *traumatic events*, not childhood; traumatic event amnesia is a diagnostic criteria, not childhood ""amnesia"". Again, what you're going through is normal. 


> I do remember feeling like I wasn't alone and that there was someone else in my body with me. When I thought about those memories I thought it was just an imaginary friend but when I see movies or shows talking about imaginary friends I realised that my ""imaginary friend"" was always in my head. A lot of time, imaginary friends sit in the seat next to the kid or is outside the body. Mine wasn't. They were always with me and not outside of my body. 

Everyone's imaginary friends are in their head. An imaginary friend being ""outside the head"" is not something anyone experiences, it's just the movie's way of showing a character talking. 


>Recently, I tried talking to my alters by talking to myself in my head. I ended up getting a really big headache that was in the front part of my head. As I continued to talk, my headache grew and it felt like someone was pushing the back of my eyes. I closed my eyes and continued to talk and when I was done I felt like I was pulled back. Immediately after it felt like my heart had skipped a beat (probably from me getting scared by the sudden pull) and I took a deep breath. It was night time and I was getting tired so I decided to go to bed.

This doesn't indicate anything either, except that you went inside your imagination and had a headache.

>I had a dream with someone that I've never seen before. They were really nice to me and we were friends instantly. That was the only dream I had that night. Normally, I wake up a lot or have a lot of dreams.

This is normal. It's just dreams.

>I tried to contact my alters again last night and I ended up having a headache in the same areas.

Again, this is you going inside your head. The headaches are from focusing too much and the stress you're putting on your attention.

>I ended up just giving up and I told them that I really wanted to meet them but I won't try to force them out since it doesn't seem to be the right thing. I have no idea if any of them can hear me or how many alters there are. I have a journal that I plan on using and I left a note in it to tell them to write something down to let me know that they had switched out.

You said in the beginning that you don't want to be the type of person that is self diagnosing, *but you already are.*

> I know this because I show many many signs of having ADHD

Why can't you stick with that? DID is *extremely serious, very severe and rare, and so many intricacies make up DID*. Nothing you mentioned here fits the basic criteria, you don't have any signs that point to DID. Everything you've mentioned here is common and normal. You're stressing yourself out over nothing. YouTube videos about DID are not informative at all and are a horrible source for information. Online quizzes are also not a source, and are tentative at best."

From the ISSTD treatment guidelines:

Although the DID patient has the subjective experience of having separate
identities, it is important for clinicians to keep in mind that the patient is
not a collection of separate people sharing the same body. The DID patient
should be seen as a whole adult person, with the identities sharing respon-
sibility for daily life. Clinicians working with DID patients generally must
hold the whole person (i.e., system of alternate identities) responsible for
the behavior of any or all of the constituent identities, even in the presence
of amnesia or the sense of lack of control or agency over behavior (see
Radden, 1996).
Treatment should move the patient toward better integrated functioning
whenever possible. In the service of gradual integration, the therapist may, at
times, acknowledge that the patient experiences the alternate identities as if
they were separate. Nevertheless, a fundamental tenet of the psychotherapy
of patients with DID is to bring about an increased degree of communication
and coordination among the identities.
In most DID patients, each identity seems to have its “own” first-person
perspective and sense of its “own” self, as well as a perspective of other
parts as being “not self.” The identity that is in control usually speaks in the
first person and may disown other parts or be completely unaware of them.
Switches among identities occur in response to changes in emotional state or
to environmental demands, resulting in another identity emerging to assume
control. Because different identities have different roles, experiences, emo-
tions, memories, and beliefs, the therapist is constantly contending with their
competing points of view.
Helping the identities to be aware of one another as legitimate parts
of the self and to negotiate and resolve their conflicts is at the very core of
the therapeutic process. It is countertherapeutic for the therapist to treat any
alternate identity as if it were more “real” or more important than any other.
The therapist should not “play favorites” among the alternate identities or
exclude apparently unlikable or disruptive ones from the therapy (althoughsuch steps may be necessary for a limited period of time at some stages in
the treatment of some patients to provide for the safety and stability of the
patient or the safety of others). The therapist should foster the idea that all
alternate identities represent adaptive attempts to cope or to master prob-
lems that the patient has faced. Thus, it is countertherapeutic to tell patients
to ignore or “get rid” of identities (although it is acceptable to provide strate-
gies for the patient to resist the influence of destructive identities, or to help
control the emergence of certain identities at inappropriate circumstances or
times).
It is countertherapeutic to suggest that the patient create additional alter-
nate identities, to name identities when they have no names (although the
patient may choose names if he or she wishes), or to suggest that identities
function in a more elaborated and autonomous way than they already are
functioning."
