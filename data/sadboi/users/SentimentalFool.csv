Here's the heart of the matter though: when you bring up that you're uncomfortable, he has to give a shit about that. You both have to care more about working together to create a life that's comfortable for both of you, than you do about being right. And right now it sounds like you're the only one on board with that, and it doesn't work unless both people are committed to it.

Feelings aren't rational. Refusing to engage with your partner because you think they're being irrational is actually pretty bogus.

Side note, a lot of what you described sounds like patterns I'm familiar with from /r/nrelationships and /r/raisedbynarcissists. You may want to check out those subs and see if anything resonates.

Regardless, if you can't get him on board with talking in a mutually respectful way about how to approach communicating and organizing your lives that feels mutually respectful, marriage counseling is probably in order. No one should have to feel like they're walking on eggshells all the time in their own home with the person who's supposed to be their partner. The whole thing with the ""when he's good, he's really really good"" pattern is that when you can't trust him to be loving/even-tempered/supportive/etc. consistently, it makes it hard to get the full benefit of it when he IS acting that way, because you don't know when the switch will flip.

Remember, counseling isn't a punishment, it's an act of good faith that you both believe things can get better.

What you describe here sounds pretty toxic, on the whole. Don't gaslight yourself into thinking it's ""not that bad."" Your complaints are totally valid, and you deserve to be treated better. I hope you can find your way to getting it from him."

I used to think the same as you, that crying is always manipulation. Therapy helped me see how this viewpoint had been shaped by the combination of

a. getting backlash from nmom when I was younger for crying, regardless if I was actually hurt (physically or emotionally) she always presumed I was doing it for attention/to manipulate... So I became very good at emotional suppression

And b. seeing her own, highly theatrical crying, which was cringily fake and clearly a ploy for attention/a manipulation tactic.

The actual truth is that crying sometimes is a totally normal and healthy way to relieve some emotional pressure, regardless of age; being able to cry around someone is a sign of vulnerability. Never crying is indicative of trauma history, and never letting anyone see you cry is a result of this lie you learned from fucked up parenting."

If I may make a couple suggestions—

1, Find a MAR (medication administration record) blank form online, print out several copies/pages if you can (but do it digitally if you can't), input both the formal name of each medication and what it does, and be diligent about writing it down every time he gets anything. Takes the pressure off your brain having to keep track of that piece. I know this doesn't directly address accidentally giving him the wrong med, but having as much infrastructure in place as possible to relieve the pressure on your brain is crucial to managing in a situation like this.

2, Lean into calendar scheduling. Again, paper or digital is fine. When you get his meds refilled, immediately mark in your calendar several days BEFORE they run out (or several weeks if it's meds you get in bulk online and you have to factor in shipping time). Again, as much of this process as you can automate to limit how much you personally have to keep track of in your head, anything helps.

Good luck. I'm sorry all this is falling to you. Stay strong, but when you're falling apart, keep coming to the caregiver support subs and reaching out. Being a caregiver can be so isolating (especially when your charge is quick to jump on you for perceived mistakes). We're here for you."

They might just legit have an anxiety disorder, which makes the amusement park option not doable for them, and they feel guilty/ashamed for shooting down two attempts in a row from you, and aren't sure what else to say. Chances are their anxiety has been a barrier to functionality in dating for them already, and they might be taking your approach as a sign that you are not like them and wouldn't want to shift to accommodate their needs. Maybe they're right, maybe not. I briefly snooped your history and saw you said you were an introvert, so you can probably empathize with the part where social interaction is draining even when it's pleasant. Consider trying something like this:

""Sorry to hear that, thank you for telling me. I'm not sure if you mean ""anxiety makes it hard to say no directly so this is my way of saying I'm not interested"" or ""anxiety limits my comfort in many contexts and neither of the options you mentioned so far would be workable for me"". If you're just not interested or it's not a good time, that's fine! I'd appreciate you saying it directly, just for clarity, but if you can't, I'll take silence as a clue to leave you be, no hard feelings. If it's the latter, though, I'm open to suggestions of activities that would be more comfortable for you. I'm an introvert, I don't need to go out and do something big to enjoy someone's company.

RedditForGrownups,fgo011a,t1_fgnbsbq,1580956676.0,"You're quite welcome—thanks for reading it even though it was long, and actually giving it due consideration.

It speaks very well of both your character and your reasoning ability that you're so game to modify your views when faced with new info—and especially so in this case, where you're managing to find compassion for someone who dragged you into her own personal tornado of instability and emotional abuse. You're a good dude. Despite just going through this insane ordeal, your better qualities are still shining through. That, in itself, is an achievement. With all the negative feelings associated with this, you owe yourself a moment of pride, too.

I've got a few more unsolicited thoughts on this; feel free to read or not at your leisure.

Number one, to the extent that it's within your control, don't let yourself feel guilty about what happened. You simply didn't know what you were dealing with. You can regret not having had the knowledge at the time to try to help her better, but you can't crucify yourself for legitimate ignorance.

More importantly, number two, the big unspoken takeaway from all of this is the importance of establishing and enforcing boundaries to protect yourself. It's a delicate line to toe, when dealing with people with such severe mental/emotional struggles, engaging enough empathy to not 100% demonize them, but still maintaining enough emotional distance that you aren't liable to get dragged down and trapped in their shit with them.

Patience is key. Building trust and emotional closeness with future partners will probably be a longer, more intentional process for you from now on, and they will have to do more to earn your trust. This is a good thing. Learning how to offer support and encouragement in measured doses, with realistic expectations (and then sitting back and seeing how the other person responds before taking any further steps) takes practice, and it can be really fucking exasperating when you're in the phase of waiting for the other person to Do The Thing. And then sometimes they don't, and you have to walk away, and talk yourself out of feeling guilty for doing so. But it beats the hell out of endlessly pouring effort into a black hole. Say it with me: No Infinite Support Without Accountability!

Skilled abusers like your ex have a sixth sense for how to leverage your empathy, how to groom you incrementally to make you more susceptible to sunk cost fallacy when shit REALLY starts to go south. To avoid getting caught in a similar situation in the future, part of your due diligence needs to be: being clear with yourself about where your lines are, communicating them clearly to the other person, and being willing to walk away when the occasion calls for it. Traumatic as this experience has been for you, I think it will make the above process more intuitive moving forward, and your relationships will be better for it.

My gut says she probably didn't date you just because of her mental illness. It certainly underwrote how you got together in the first place, but it sounds like the real person in there, trapped in her head with the BPD monster, actually did really like you. Not every mental illness is like this, but for the ones that are, you have to maintain the perspective that you have two relationships—one with the person, and one with their illness. You can have compassion for the person, but if their illness is a legitimate barrier to you getting your needs met, building trust, creating stability together, communicating, etc., then you can't stay in it forever, hoping for things to change. If you feel like you have more of a relationship with the illness than the person and there's no end in sight, it's time to bail. Depending on the relationship, this doesn't mean you have to go nuclear. Like if it's a friend or family member for example, there is a pretty robust bandwidth of middle ground between ""all in"" and ""no contact."" You'll find the optimal balance on a case-by-case basis, as needed.

Ultimately, mental illness is still illness, and it's the person's own responsibility to regard it as such and seek appropriate treatment. Yeah, there's still a bit of a stigma associated with seeking mental healthcare in this country, and she may even have more invisible barriers depending on the values of her heritage culture (you implied her family is in another country). And the illness itself, the way it makes the person think, is a barrier.

BUT: *You are not responsible for her.* Yeah, it sucks that her support system is lacking, but nothing about that obliges you to step in. This isn't on you. She might be a trainwreck, but she's also an adult. The onus is on her to take responsibility for her shit. We all have our own histories and baggage to muddle through. The particular flavor of hers doesn't excuse her from responsibility.

In a way, you got lucky with this one. You could have gotten trapped for years in a serious relationship with someone you felt beholden to stay with. Instead, you got to learn all this by being the side piece, which makes it a lot easier to walk away. Not trying to minimize your suffering here. Just glad circumstances were such that you COULD get out after six months, rather than six years, or sixty.

It's really up to you to decide what, if anything, to do at this point to make peace with the situation. If you decide to try to be in touch with her to some degree, to try to offer support or even just to give her the right terminology about what her issue is, be sure not to get a hero complex that makes you get stupid about it. She doesn't get to define the terms of the relationship anymore, and she definitely doesn't get to pick and choose with you such that she gets all the benefits of your friendship/support/etc. without any accountability for herself. Offhand, for example, I don't think it would be a good idea to low-key stay in touch with her, even just to try to steer her towards better therapy, while she's still hiding all this from her boyfriend. But if you can think of tangible behavioral goalposts you could set for her to try to start earning your trust and support, there might be a way to do that right. You could also just send her a one-off message that doesn't invite further contact. You'd also be well within your rights to tell her to go fuck herself and send a bunch of documentary evidence of your relationship to her boyfriend. Wholesale walking away is also fine. There's really no black-and-white to this, except that your first duty is to yourself.

If you feel like coming back and updating, either this thread or a DM, I'd love to know how this all turns out. No pressure though.

Really, you can speculate all you want about how your friends see you, but unless you ask them, it's just speculation. You will probably need to take the lead on initiating communication about these topics. It's a bit unusual to outright ask someone what they think of you, but sometimes you just have to do it. Here's an example of how you might bring it up with a good friend:

""Hey, I've been feeling some weird emotions lately and just kind of trapped in my head with them. I think I need a reality check. I would really love to get your input if you're comfortable listening.""

Then, if they say yes:

""Okay so I guess I've been sensing some distance between us, and I can't tell if it's all in my head. I know that I have depression and anxiety, and these things can make me think someone is upset with me or pulling away, even if they're not. So I don't feel like I can totally trust my own judgments or perceptions if I feel like something might be wrong, I don't want to bring it up and sound crazy, but I can't shake the feeling that something is off. It really matters to me to be a good friend to my friends, and to have mutual respect and comfort in the friendship. I guess I'm not really sure what your needs are from me as a friend, so I'm not confident I'm being the friend you need, and I'm uncomfortable with that. Also, if there IS something I've done to offend/alienate you or the group, I want to know what it is so I can apologize and try to do better in the future. I've just been stuck in my head thinking about all the possibilities of what might be going on, and realized the smart thing to do is just ask what you actually think rather than keep speculating to myself about it.""

Good communication is difficult and takes practice, but it starts with you taking the first step. It's a skill set that will serve you well in all your personal relationships for the rest of your life. Invest effort in it. If you're confused, speak up and ask for clarification. If you're uncomfortable, speak up and ask for honesty and mutual concern.

There is a concept called ""love languages"" that is usually applied to romantic relationships, but it's relevant to any kind of close personal relationship, including friends and family. Basically the main points are that everyone receives and expresses love differently, and it's important to be aware of the things that make you feel loved and communicate them to other people, and to try to learn what makes the other people feel loved and offer them that, because it might be different from what makes you feel loved, and if you don't talk about it, you'll probably end up both offering each other what you yourself need, and possibly wasting a lot of effort if the other person's needs are different. Maybe you try really hard to tell your friends how much they matter to you, but they never do the same for you, and the inequity is painful. Maybe what they really want from you is less talking and more quality time together, and they don't know how to ask for it. Just look up ""love languages"" and see if there's anything helpful there you can apply to your friendships.

Last two points:

I saw in your post history that you're underage. I don't know what that means exactly, but I'm guessing somewhere in the range of 15-17. Your frontal lobe isn't even fully developed yet at that age, so even at a physical, biological level, never mind life experience, you still have some developing to do before you're a full adult. Things like impulse inhibition, which matter a lot in personal relationships. Give yourself time and space to keep growing. This goes for the rest of your life. Don't ever get fooled into thinking you're done growing up and have nothing left to learn. Finding the healthy middle ground where you're open to constructive criticism and willing to try to change for the better, but still have good baseline self-esteem and aren't bottoming out all the time—this stuff takes a lifetime to learn. Go easy on yourself.

And lastly, keep a journal. Keep track of what you're eating and drinking and when, your sleep, the weather, any events that might affect your mood, etc. And write down how you're feeling throughout the day. There's nothing like solid data to help you sort things out. Maybe you're skipping breakfast, struggling through the first half of the day and then spending the second half trying to catch up. Maybe a million things. Just start writing it all down. Do it for at least a month, and see what patterns emerge. I'm not trying to minimize what you're feeling or suggest it's probably just poorly managed self-care or something—just encouraging you to take a scientific approach to figuring out what all affects how you're feeling, to better set you up to meet the challenges.

Keep fighting for your happiness and the health of your personal relationships. You're still young, but also, life is short, and tomorrow is never guaranteed. Talk with your friends. Ask for the reassurance you need, and the feedback to help you adjust your mentality and behaviors in ways that benefit both you and them.

Now. Wanna give us more detailed examples of the situations that you're describing in your original post?"
depression,fgn3r1e,t1_fgjh1o4,1580937135.0,"[1/2]

All right, this is going to be very long. I'm going to post it in two parts.

I don't know much about Greek culture, but I'm curious whether you/your family is religious. Sometimes the conflict between the values/expectations imposed on us by religion, vs. by influences outside our little bubble (like the diverse international community here on Reddit), vs. by our own intrinsic needs/interests, can be enough to create a lot of constant anxiety. Also, what are your family relationships like?

There are a few basic themes in your post history that I'd like to focus on.

1. Mental health. You've said you deal with pretty constant anxiety, and you've hinted that there may be some traumatic events in your past. I wonder if these two things are related, and whether you've ever had any therapy to help you process whatever you've been through. The cultural values piece might come into play here too, if you come from a culture that discourages addressing mental health needs. Whatever you've been through, it's important to talk about it—with friends, a therapist, a religious leader, strangers on the internet. It's important not to let the experiences further isolate you by avoiding opening up about it. External processing is so crucial for getting past a lot of shit.

2. Physical health. You have various physical conditions, and regardless if you tested negative for Celiac, it sounds like a gluten-free diet still makes a big difference for you. So it's really important to stick with it. Physical and mental health are very tied into each other, as I'm sure you know. Constant physical discomfort would wear on anyone, and the brain fog is a monster. Part of addressing your mental and emotional health, is taking better care of your body. You have to quit smoking for a few weeks and see how that changes things. Nicotine is a stimulant—it can amplify both the physical and mental effects of anxiety, it can mess with your sleep. Weed is complex, because it can certainly have some medicinal effects for anxiety, but it also contributes to the brain fog. So if part of your anxiety is stemming from the effects of the brain fog, the weed might be doing you more harm than good. It's a good idea to develop a more robust set of tools for handling stress and anxiety, anyway. If you want to be scientific about it, quit one at a time, and wait >3 weeks in between so you can more easily isolate the effects of the two substances. Quitting cigarettes will make you irritable for awhile until you get through it. Some of the effects of quitting weed might take several weeks or over a month to become apparent and bounce back, stuff like short term memory ability. Quitting smoking everything will make your senses of smell and taste keener, too. But just in general, you need to take the external pressures off your physical system, and then see what symptoms remain.

3. Identity, sense of self and self-esteem. There are several points to hit here. You describe yourself as smart, and that seems pretty important to your identity. (Side note, as a self-identified ""smart"" person myself who's also had the experience of dealing with brain fog for medical reasons, I really empathize with how threatening and exasperating the experience is. Like when you're feeling foggy, it's not a mild symptom—it comes between you and your sense of self, and you feel like you can't really live your life until the fogginess has passed. It's very disorienting and stressful.) Another thing that sounds both important to your identity, and connected (in your mind) to the concept of being smart, is being a good friend. Being smart might help you come up with good advice when advice is wanted, but in terms of being a good friend, the things that matter more are: knowing how to just listen when someone is upset and NOT jump straight to offering advice/trying to fix things, and in general just showing up (not cancelling plans all the time, being fairly punctual). There is a balance between being a good friend when your friends need help, vs. being fun and easy to hang out with when nothing's wrong, or when friends want a distraction from the hard stuff rather than to talk about the hard stuff. It seems like you sense an imbalance here with your friends, and it's impossible to tell from the outside if it's real. Could it be that your friends just aren't going through anything difficult right now, and that's why they're not trying to open up to you? Do you have reason to believe they're opening up to one another and specifically avoiding interacting with you in these ways? More information needed on this one.

Now for the advice/insights part.

It's clear you value personal growth, and are willing and able to humble yourself to pursue it. That's wonderful—hang onto that.

It's really important to remember that there is always going to be a difference between reality and your perception of it. Part of being a good adult is cultivating the skills necessary to stay aware of this and get reality checks as needed. You can't buy too far into your perceptions and assumptions about what other people are thinking, without trying to communicate with them about it. It sounds like your current experience is that you're trying your best to be a good friend, but you don't feel like your efforts are seen or valued by your friends, so it maybe feels like a waste of your energy, and maybe you're feeling a bit unappreciated and lonely. Am I understanding that right? If not, please clarify.

Basically, I cannot over-emphasize the importance of good, open communication. Without more details about the specific situations that led you to post here in the first place, all I can really do is speculate, but it seems that any of the following might be possible:

- Your friends DO see the effort you put in, and do appreciate it, but they aren't telling you that, and you need to hear it to know it's true.

- Your friends are blissfully unaware of your efforts or the fact that you feel like connection is lacking there, because their needs aren't that big, so they don't have needs you're failing to meet.

- Your friends are avoiding opening up to you, and aren't being proactive about talking to you about it. If so, there are many reasons why this might be. (Maybe they're scared to hurt your feelings by demanding more from you when they know you're already having a hard time. Maybe they already tried and didn't get the response from you they wanted. Maybe they're conflict-avoidant and the idea of bringing it up just stresses them out so they don't do it.)"
MMFB,fgmai94,t3_eyx7bd,1580920946.0,"Hey, it's okay to be a total fucking mess with a bunch of contradicting needs right now. This is a terrifying situation. I'm so glad you're finally being taken seriously by your doctors. You're doing great for just continuing to advocate for yourself and not letting anyone convince you your symptoms are just in your head. I've been through similar, feel free to DM me if you want to chat or vent. Sometimes text-only communication is a good middle ground when you need to connect about what's going on but can't deal with people. No pressure though. Remember to breathe. Rooting for you regardless."
amiwrong,fgm8aed,t3_ez4moh,1580919821.0,"You are not wrong for being upset. You are being cut off from a part of the grieving process you had been counting on having access to, and had no reason to think it would go a different way.

Do you have any idea of where this is coming from? Is your grandma just exhausted from grief and managing logistics, and trying to make things as simple as possible for herself just to get to the other side of it all? Does she have adequate support in managing the logistics? Is it a control thing?

Does all of your communication about it have to go through your mom? Can you call your grandma directly and ask what's up?

Might it be possible to have two services? One that is small to accommodate your grandma's desire, and a bigger one where anyone who wants to come pay their respects can attend? It seems weird to cut all of the rest of his friends and family out of a pretty standard grieving ritual, but I don't know what other factors or obstacles are in play here.

In any case I'm really sorry you're going through this, it definitely makes an already hard situation even more difficult."
internetparents,fgm58vh,t3_ez6enh,1580918222.0,"Shit, that's awful.

From experience—prepare to be very ""not yourself"" for awhile. Big losses leave us pretty emotionally unaccountable for awhile. You may end up doing or saying things you look back on later with confusion. This is normal and okay.

For the next week or two, you'll likely have a lot of logistical stuff to keep you busy. This can be a blessing. To the extent that you're able, though, try to delegate some of it. Don't be the only one calling people to let them know she's gone.

Remember to keep meeting your own basic self-care needs, even if it's difficult and there doesn't seem to be a point to it. Remember to eat and bathe. Stay hydrated. Walk the dog, if you have one. Adherence to routines is really helpful when it's all falling apart.

In a few weeks or a month, after the funeral, after the initial flurry has died down, most people will start going back to their lives, and you'll be left in a new, different kind of lonely grief. The distractions won't be as forthcoming, and people will start leaving you alone more. This is the hardest part for a lot of people. The world generally starts expecting you to get back to normal, but you won't be ready. You'll be exhausted and running at a deficit for awhile.

After a few months, people will say things like ""How are you?"" There's an implicit pressure to say ""I'm fine,"" to not burden others with your endless sadness. Don't give into it. Be honest with yourself and others as much as possible. Grieving is so isolating, anyway; don't help your enemy there by trying to protect others from yourself. If they're asking, it's because they care and want to support you. Take them up on it. You're always allowed to say ""I'm really not fine. It still feels like yesterday. Trying to push it out of my mind and live like normal is disorienting. Thanks for asking.""

Don't be fooled into thinking that talking about it is going to make it better. Nothing is going to make it better. It's just going to suck for a long time. But talking about it does make it less awful, sometimes. That's different from making it better, if you know what I mean.

Try to pay attention to your needs in terms of social contact, and grant yourself the comforts you can. If you don't want to be alone but are so drained you can't handle hanging out, it's okay to ask someone to come just be with you, quietly occupying the same space for awhile, not talking. Ask for what you know you need, and be easy on yourself when you have no idea what you need.

Progress isn't linear. It's going to be awful for a long time, and then, slowly, slightly less so. But it's really not linear. Suddenly you'll realize you were just having a moment when you didn't feel totally broken, and that realization will be enough to throw you right back into it. You'll be somewhere between fine and functional one day, and then the next, can't get out of bed. You'll be in the middle of something mundane and then all of a sudden you'll be totally haunted and losing it. Slowly, the overall trend moves toward functionality.

Firsts are hard. Holidays, birthdays, anniversaries. Tomorrow, when you wake up, it'll be the first time you wake up to a world without her in it. The first time you laugh again might feel like a betrayal.

Knowing what's normal, having good support, etc., isn't going to make it ok. Nothing's going to make it okay. So much of this process is just letting it be not okay, letting yourself be not okay.

Be as compassionate to yourself as you would be to your best friend. You're allowed to be lost and broken. You're allowed to fuck up.

Talk to her. Look for her in your dreams.

RedditForGrownups,fgg3q5h,t3_exvewz,1580753591.0,"Damn dude, I'm sorry you went through all that.

Life experience is something we often get just *after* we needed it—but then the experience informs our future choices, so we don't keep fucking up the same way repeatedly.

Hindsight is 20/20. You didn't know going into it how it would end up. People are naturally inclined to be somewhat trusting; going into everything expecting the worst, is a reaction to having been screwed over, and is not how you want to live the rest of your life. She took advantage of this natural benefit of the doubt, and went to elaborate lengths to deceive you. You're not stupid for falling prey to effective tactics. She's probably had practice.

Part of continuing to grow up is the ""continuing"" part—never getting suckered in by the fallacy that ""I'm X years old, I'm all grown up now with nothing left to learn."" There's no set age by which we are supposed to have learned how to negotiate the healthy middle ground between being naive/innocent/trusting and being jaded/cynical. And even *with* relevant life experience under our belts, every situation is different. Having been through this is no guarantee you're going to be able to 100% successfully avoid anything similar in the future, but that doesn't mean you're failing to learn the lessons. There's just only so much you can know in advance. We do the best we can with the resources we have at the time.

Perhaps one of the lessons here is about learning more about what SPECIFIC red flags are ""worse"" than others—more important to pay attention to—and how to respond in a way that protects yourself while still being compassionate to the other person. May I recommend you do some research on cluster B personality disorders, especially BPD. And also cPTSD. IANAD but her behavior sounds indicative of that type of disorder, and arming yourself with some foreknowledge about specific signs to look out for in the future might help you come out of the fog on this one. (Spoiler alert, while it may be the only true thing she told you, the existence of trauma since her childhood is almost certainly true. Anti-depressants alone aren't enough to address stuff like that; she needs trauma-specific therapy, which is pretty different from regular therapy. If, in the future, you ever have a friend, partner or other with a trauma history, you don't need to immediately run screaming for the hills, but do encourage them to seek the right treatments for what's actually wrong.)

Is part of your difficulty finding closure on this a sense of moral obligation to do something about it? It wouldn't be out of the question to send her a message like ""Hey, if you actually want to get out of the cycle of doing things like what you did to me, you need to get a therapist that specializes in trauma and actually unpack your shit with someone whose job it is to help you figure out how to overcome it. I really hope you do, because despite your weird behavior, it's clear there is a really smart and interesting person under all that who's been miserable and trapped for a long time, and I don't think you want to spend your whole life doing this over and over."" You also wouldn't be out of line to reach out to her boyfriend, especially as her behavior stands to endanger his health, but if you choose to do that, be prepared for an angry, disbelieving response.

Do you have any close friends or family you would feel comfortable opening up to about your experience? It's probably not a bad idea for you to try and find a therapist for yourself, too, at least for a little while, to give you some space to process this out loud a bit. It's a terrible situation that would fuck anyone up, and it really makes a difference talking to someone in person. Don't isolate yourself.

Also, if you haven't already, please get yourself tested for STIs, just on general principle. I know there's potentially a decent amount of embarrassment and shame in this, but getting the piece of paper that says you're clean may really help your peace of mind on all this.

However you chose to proceed, I hope you can find a way through this that lets you rebuild your ability to trust—trusting other people, and trusting your own judgment.

Best of luck to you.

raisedbynarcissists,fg0q6de,t1_fg0gki9,1580412860.0,"My heart goes out to you so much right now. The situation you're in is insanely stressful and scary. You're not nuts for feeling how you do. Things are about to change in ways you can't predict or control. Regardless if things weren't good in the first place, that's still terrifying. Breathe.

You've been sitting on a powder keg you didn't create or choose. Regardless if it was your doing or someone else's, and regardless if you pulled the trigger on purpose or let it slip by accident, try to cut yourself some slack. You've been living in a state of constant crisis. You're doing your best. You're only human. No one is perfect, or perfectly in control of themselves 100% of the time.

The environment you've been living in has forced you to take an adult level of responsibility for things in a way, and to a degree, that's totally unfair. You're missing out on your childhood. The real truth is that you didn't create the situation, it's not actually even _possible_ for you to fix it, and even if it were, it's not your responsibility. I know this flies in the face of your reality, and it'll probably take a hundred times of hearing it before it remotely starts to sink in, but it's true. You did not, and are not, destroying your family. You don't have the power to do that. Guilt is often our brain's way of trying to trick us into believing we had control of the situation in the first place, and we somehow fucked up, so if things aren't great then we should feel bad about it. Because that's still easier to accept than the idea that we never had any control in the first place. I hope, in time, and hopefully with the support of a good trauma therapist, you can start to accept that legitimately NONE of what's going on is your fault. But, give yourself time. Compassion for yourself above all.

Your brothers might blame you initially. They're kids, desperately needing stability, scared of change, and with very naive/undeveloped ability to understand the nuances of a situation as complex and adult as the one you all (including themselves) are in. Think of the difference in how you felt and behaved towards your older brother ~4 years ago, vs. how you think and feel now. Just keep your mind and heart open that regardless of their initial reaction, time can change and heal things. They aren't going to be able to immediately appreciate the ways your actions may be literally saving their lives. That doesn't make it any less true.

Can you talk to your counselor again and impress upon her the importance of DCF talking to YOU first before your parents? Let her know it's a serious safety issue, and see if she'll advocate for that. If not, call DCF yourself and try to track down your case number and talk to your case manager. I have no idea what protocol is, so it might not be possible, but it's worth a try.

Also, please let your friend's mom know things have taken a turn, in a way that might speed up the timeline for you needing to get out. You need your support system more than ever right now.

I know this probably sounds like an empty platitude right now but, it's going to be okay. Frankly it's been really NOT okay for a long time, it can only go up from here.

Breathe."

raisedbynarcissists,ffx8ahz,t3_eq4tjs,1580319833.0,"Hey again, jumping here from the other thread.

It seems to me that getting back in touch with your older brother is a great idea, for many reasons. I'm pretty sure he'll appreciate the apology and validation. And I can't believe this didn't strike me last night but if you do decide to get a PFA, he could also be the person to back you up on that.

As for how to apologize? Be sincere, and make it be more about him than about you, at least for the initial contact. And make sure you let him know that you are not acting on their behalf, that you will not betray him to them. If he responds well, you will have the chance later to try to explain what you were feeling at the time. If he is a reasonable person, he will probably understand that you were just an upset kid.

Here's a rough first draft to get you started, edit and use as you see fit:

Subject: a long-overdue apology

Dear ___,

I am so sorry for how I behaved when you decided to cut contact with our parents. I totally get it now. You were doing what you had to do to save yourself. I'm sure the things I said to you at the time made an already painful situation even worse, and I am deeply sorry for that. You deserved so much better, from them, and from me.

I also wanted to thank you for showing me that it was possible to leave. It took me awhile to figure out that they are really not okay. I am now trying to find the strength to do what you did, and I am seeing how hard it must have been for you. I worry about what will happen to [younger brothers]. But you were right—this is no way to live.

I really hope you're doing better now. I miss you. If you're open to it, I would really love to be back in each other's lives, even just to a small degree. Our concept of family is pretty warped from the one we were born into, but I would be grateful for the chance to do better with each other in the future, on our own terms.

I promise I am speaking from the heart here. I hope you can hear my sincerity. If you are willing to talk to me, you have my word I won't say anything about it to anyone in the family. I will help you uphold the boundaries you have set, I will protect your privacy.

If you could even just write back a ""."" to let me know you read this, I'd appreciate it. But if you're not ready even for that, I understand. Just please know that I will be happy to hear from you anytime, even if it's years from now.

If you're open to further communication, [insert your contact info here]. I would love to talk, but if emailing or texting is more comfortable for you, that's fine. I don't want to pressure you.

Wishing you all the best, no matter what.

Love,
[Etc.]

//

Feel free to personalize it to your satisfaction. If there's a song that makes you think of him, or a happy memory you want to share, etc., go for it, just be sure to phrase it in a way it can't be mistaken for an attempt at manipulation.

Also, I'm realizing I've assumed you'll be sending him an email. If you don't have his email address or would prefer a different way of reaching out, we can rethink the content to fit your terms.

Do you know anything about how his life is now? Much as I don't want to pollute this comment/topic with anxieties, in the interest of you being prepared for anything—it's not unthinkable that he might not yet be in a good place himself. There are many risks for people coming from abusive situations. He may be doing great. He may be wrestling with addiction. Maybe a million things. Just, if he doesn't write back, don't assume it's because you didn't do it right, or he doesn't think you're worth it, or he's still mad at you. It might be that he's embarrassed about not being where HE wants to be yet, and doesn't want you to see him as a fuck-up.

If you have any remote concern about the above, consider adding a small paragraph to the letter along the lines of:

""I have no idea what your life is like now, but I'm not writing because I expect you to be perfect. I don't need you to be a replacement parent/role-model. If you're still struggling too, don't let that keep you from reaching back out to me. I won't judge you, and I'd be grateful for the chance to show you some love and support too, even/especially if you're not at your best. I still want to hear from you.""

I really hope this works out for you. Having someone who's literally been through exactly what you're going through could be an invaluable boost to your support system and your sanity right now. And I'm sure you can see that if he's been through what you have, having you reach out to validate that it's awful and he was right to leave, probably stands to do him more good than harm, and may help him with his own healing.

... All right, I think I've inflicted my verbose ways on you enough for now, it's shutting up time for me.

Let us know how it goes!!"
RedvsBlue,ffwuib1,t1_ffwmgfe,1580311297.0,Holy shit I love you. Thank you magical internet wizard
raisedbynarcissists,ffwsh02,t1_ffwp040,1580309931.0,"Awww. Yeah, you're definitely a survivor lol. I'm just eager to see you graduate to ""thriver"", and doing so successfully requires a lot of structural support. You're doing really well with starting to create it though!! Reaching out here, involving your friend and their mom, your interaction the other week with the school nurse etc., the fact that your work has a clue about your situation and supports you... These are all GREAT.

Thanks so much for writing back in such depth. It means a lot to ME to know you actually read and considered what I wrote. And I'm so sorry for how harsh and scary the CPS stuff I said was, I'm not trying to upset you. I just really want your escape to work and be permanent, and trying to support you in thinking that through thoroughly means leading you into some scary places. Again, I'm really sorry for the discomfort of that, and thank you for reading it anyway. If you want me to steer clear of topics like that, or signal you with a code word so you can know it's coming and choose to read it when you're feeling up to it, I'm open to whatever. The last thing I want to do is overwhelm you even more than you already are.

That's kinda fuckin brilliant that you have your own contact info set with your school. Do you think you could do that for your medical providers too? I forgot to ask about doctors stuff in my previous epic novel.

That Coffee With Cops thing sounds like a PERFECT resource, wow. Yes, definitely take advantage of that. Why don't more places do that?! That's such a good idea.

Not right now, because I think I've already hit you with more than enough for one day (... week.... lifetime) but I'm putting a bookmark in the topic of how to approach leaving, whenever you do, in such a way that leaves your relationship with your little brothers in better shape than your relationship with your older brother. I've got a few thoughts on this but it can wait for right now.

Also I have more thoughts about older brother, but I think I'm going to post them in response to your post about apologizing to him, to help me keep it all organized.

I've gotta run for right now but I'll come back a little while later today. In the meantime, if this wasn't obvious, feel free to DM me anytime if you need to vent. Happy to listen.

Final two thoughts for right now:

1. I have no idea what kinds of music you like, but the past few years [this](https://youtu.be/fsW1z9QThsA) has become one of my personal anthems, so I'm passing it along just in case it speaks to you too. Also the music video for it is gorgeous.

2. I hope you can try to do something nice for yourself today. Even just something little. You deserve it.

You're doing great with all this. Keep hanging in there. It's a long road ahead, but you're not alone.

I'll check back in a bit."

I generally hate feeling cold, but one time a couple winters ago I found myself in the middle of a stress-induced episode when I realized it had just snowed and I had access to a spot of back yard covered in at least a foot of really soft untouched snow. I went out and lied in it, face-down. One of the most amazing experiences of my life to date, tbh. Highly recommended. I stayed there for long enough I started to worry a neighbor would mistake me for a dead body, just lying there motionless, face-down in the snow, and call the cops."

And it'll be well-warranted."
raisedbynarcissists,ffvs1wb,t1_ffvqke1,1580271636.0,"[2/2]

Finally, and this is the hardest one, I want to drill down a little bit on the stuff about CPS. First and foremost, you've said in previous comments that there's more going on than you've disclosed, and some of the stuff in the house could get CPS to remove the kids if they were called. You need to get as much photographic evidence as possible of all of this stuff in question, whatever it is, and store the photos somewhere secure, preferably multiple locations, as insurance for yourself. Take pictures of EVERYTHING, because if shit REALLY hits the fan, those pictures are going to be the only thing making it more than just your word against theirs. Email them to yourself, save them to the cloud. Anything to prevent your parents taking your phone and then you don't have access to them anymore. Even if you never go nuclear, if the time comes that you need to substantiate to anyone—law enforcement, school admins, heaven knows who you might need to really make your case to—why you refuse to go back with your parents and why you don't want them to have access to your information, having ANY documentary evidence to back you up can be the difference that makes it be NOT a ""he said she said"" situation and might be your ticket to freedom. (Side note, also, collect whatever of your own personal documents [birth certificate, SS card etc] you can find before you bail.) If you want your running-away to stick, you have to be willing to call your parents' bluff if they try to come after you. You have to be prepared to say, ""Go ahead, call the cops, I'd be glad to tell them where you keep your drugs."" Or whatever it is. The fact that CPS has already been called before might really work to your favor, in the end.

Here's the thing. I feel your pain and fear about having CPS actually come to their house again, before or after you've gone, because you don't want to break up the family. I know you think you're protecting your family by keeping your mouth shut, but the hard truth is that your family is already in danger every day. You have to hear me when I say that YOU ARE NOT THE PROBLEM. Your parents' addictive and abusive behaviors are at fault for all of this, and there has to be a point where you stop falling on your sword to protect them from the consequences of their own behavior. I know you don't want your little brothers to go through having CPS called and the fallout from that. But think about the situation they're guaranteed to experience if you keep going out of your way to enable them to maintain the status quo. Think really hard about what's going to happen when you leave. You think shit's just magically gonna get better? HELL no. Things will get WORSE for them after you leave, not better. Your parents will be really pissed off, and will probably deal with it by leaning even harder into their addictions and anger, and finding a new scapegoat to replace you—likely one of your brothers. You said this is exactly what happened to you when your older brother left, and it nuked your relationship with him too—what makes you think it would go differently when you leave? Deep down, do you really believe you're protecting your younger brothers by trying to keep the household intact? From the outside, it seems more likely they might be saved by going to live elsewhere. What happens if one of them dies in a car crash because your dad was drunk? You'd feel complicit and guilty forever. ... So as much as you can while you're still there, collect evidence. Even if most or all of it can't be used in court, just collect it anyway. Put a sound recorder app on your phone somewhere easy to get to and start taking recordings on the DL when things heat up. If there's physical abuse, take pictures of the scars/bruises/cigarette burns/whatever. Be as sneaky as you need to. You're not just building a case for fun here, you're fighting for your life, and your brothers' lives as well. Just because your parents are doing a semi-passable job of looking normal to the casual observer, doesn't mean your brothers are going to have a safe, happy childhood after you leave. In reality they may actually have better lives somewhere else. You're not being a bad person or daughter to acknowledge that possibility. Because the environment your parents have created is dangerous and terrifying. You're doing what you have to do to save yourself, and I applaud you for it. But you do have to accept the potential consequences of REALLY committing to this, and part of it is that at some point you may have to choose between being honest with cops/CPS (one may involve the other) or just going back with them, and the latter is simply not an option. When you get out, stay out. CPS may be called at some point by someone else other than you, anyway. You need to be as prepared as possible, just in case.

I'm worried for you, but also hopeful. Sorry this ended up being so long but there's just so much to think about when you're planning a change this big. Ultimately, you have to put your own oxygen mask on first as they say, and if there are negative consequences of that for other people, the best you can do is try to plan ahead for them. I'll be over here rooting for you with the rest of us, sending you lots of luck and hoping that you'll be able to keep us somewhat up to date as things develop.

You are fighting against unimaginable odds, and yet you are still here. That alone is an incredible achievement. Keep going. You have had an incredibly shitty past, and you deserve a better future. I can't wait to see you get it."

You think you're writing too much? Wait til you see what I've got for you lol. It's too long to even fit in one comment, so I'll post part 2 as a reply to part 1.

I know this is a MAJOR wall of text, but I'm asking you to do me the favor of at least reading the paragraph after this one, and the first two (extra-long) ones at the beginning of part 2, and let me know you've read them so I know I'm not shouting into the ether here.

First off, you're not being annoying at all—this is what we're here for. I know I'm not the only one here who worries about you specifically and checks your recent posts to make sure you're still alive. Every thing I read about you getting in the car with your drunk dad makes my heart stop. PLEASE DO keep coming back here and updating us about every damn thing. We're here for you, and we're rooting for you.

Secondly, it's clear you're rapidly approaching your breaking point. I saw you said your friend's mom understands your situation, and it seems like even if that's where your parents would think to look for you, it may be your best option for now. I don't want to overwhelm you, but I want to raise a few points for you to consider before you jump ship.

Your best way to protect yourself through this transition involves getting out ahead of the chaos as much as possible, in ways that don't endanger yourself or your plans—but to make sure that whoever is going to hear about the situation that matters, hears about it from you first.

Your school. Can you talk to the guidance counselor? Are there any teachers, coaches or administrators you have a good relationship with that you feel comfortable opening up to? You don't need to go into a ton of detail, but even just to say ""Hey I want to talk to you real quick about something going on in my life—things aren't good at my house, so I'm planning on going to stay with a friend for awhile. I don't want this to be public knowledge, but I wanted to let you know in advance because things might be a little chaotic for me for a little while and I just want you to know why before I'm in the thick of it. I have every intention of continuing to come to school and do my work as normal, etc."" Make sure you speak frankly about the potential consequences, both positive and negative, of them calling CPS. But if there's even one adult at school you can give the heads-up to, it may help smooth some parts of the transition. (Side note, even if you can't do any of the above, maybe you can just talk to the counselor about the eating disorder stuff? I really want to see you get more support on that. I know it's hard though.)

You may also specifically want to talk to anyone in school administration you trust, about what kind of access your parents may have to your information. Do some research and see if things like filing for emancipation might give you a leg to stand on to ask the school to help protect you in the meantime. I know filing for emancipation 4 months before you turn 18 doesn't make sense for its own sake, but I don't know, for example, if having that documentation might support other efforts of yours.

Which brings me to my next thing. Look up the laws for PFAs in your state/city/county, and see if they cover emotional abuse as well as physical. This is a sticky one because in order for a minor to file a PFA against their own parent, another adult with some kind of legal/filial relationship to you probably needs to back you, and I don't know, for example, if you have a good relationship with an aunt/uncle/etc. who knows what's going on and would be willing to have your back on that. But it's worth a shot.

As for your friend's mom. You say she gets your situation, but you don't want to burden or stress her, which is understandable. I encourage you to have a really open discussion with her ASAP about every piece of what you both can expect if you do start staying there. If you are somehow able to get a PFA in advance, it could protect you both—if your parents show up and start making a scene, is your friend's mom willing to threaten to call the cops, and then actually go through with it? If she refuses to turn you over to your parents, is she committing a crime because you're under 18 and have no legal status or documentation to support not wanting to go home? Is she willing and able to provide you transportation to and from school and extracurricular activities as needed? Can she afford to feed you? Etc. These are all things you need to both have clearly set expectations about BEFORE they come up in real life. Also let her know clearly that you are scared of retaliation, and that confrontation/conflict sometimes makes you freeze up, so you can try to make plans in advance about how she can step up to help/protect you in that situation. All you can do is give her all the information you have and then let her make her own choices. If you've been really up-front with her about all of it and she's STILL comfortable taking it on, then that's her choice.

Are you hoping/planning to go straight to college upon graduation? If so, do you already have a plan in place? If you're cutting your parents off completely, I'm guessing that probably means they won't be paying for school. However, most schools and governmental programs will still base your financial aid eligibility on your parents' income unless you jump through hoops to prove yourself independent, and they all have different criteria for that. So it may behoove you to call ahead to any relevant entities and see what it'll take to get them to evaluate you as an independent, and not have your parents or their info involved in any way.

I can tell you from personal experience that both individual people and institutions tend to not think clearly when parents contact them demanding info on their child. You need to think about how to protect yourself after you bail, both short-term and long-term. Make it clear to any friends of yours whose contact info your parents have, that you're bailing, and that if your parents try to contact them for information on you, to stonewall them. And that anyone who betrays your trust on this can count themselves out of your life. I know it sounds harsh but if you're legit worried for your safety if they find you, desperate times call for desperate measures, and you absolutely must state your expectations clearly beforehand. Moreover, do everything you can to keep your parents from knowing where you go to school or work after you graduate, and to the extent you're able, put administration on notice everywhere you'll be spending a lot of time that if anyone claiming to be your parents tries to contact you or get info on you through them, that they are to play dumb, because your parents are abusive. Regardless of the laws that are supposed to be in place to protect people, without being given a heads-up, most people will just answer the questions without thinking.

It might be in your best interest to go into the local police station for your district—whoever would be sending cops if there were an incident at your friend's place while you were staying there—ask to speak to an officer to get advice. Try to strike up a relationship with the police BEFORE you need them. If you get lucky and can find an officer you feel comfortable with, tell them at least some of what's been going on, the emotional abuse at least, and that you're planning on moving to a friend's house but you expect your parents to fight you. I don't know if you can file a report for emotional abuse, but even if you can form a good rapport with the people at the station, get them to know your face and name and see that you're a reasonable person with a good head on your shoulders, then they'll have that and your story in their head if they get called to a scene between you and your parents.

Stable assessments like the Strong Interest Inventory and the MBTI can be good tools, and while you can also find other certified people to administer them, sometimes you can get them through school for free.

Here are some random examples, I haven't thoroughly vetted them so no promises, but just ideas to get you started:

SameGrassButGreener,ffu69fe,t3_eaozk5,1580235377.0,"Good on you for listening to your gut. I was in a similar situation and toughed it out, then wished I hadn't because it took _years_ to emotionally catch up from the exhaustion of living at the end of my rope for years. Most people told me I was trying to run away from my problems. In hindsight, if I'd just moved somewhere warmer at the time, I still could have gotten therapy in the new location, and been better set up to reap the benefits.

I don't have advice for where to move, but I do want to give you a heads up about a financial thing. If you have government loans, study the repayment terms before deciding how to proceed. Four semesters into college, I took a fall semester off and ended up shooting myself in the foot because my school loans only deferred as long as I was in school, and 6 months out of school was enough to trigger me having to start paying them back, EVEN AFTER I RE-ENROLLED. So spring semester ended in May and I didn't go back until the following January, and even though I was enrolled full-time from then through the end of school, I ended up having to make monthly payments the whole second half of college because of the semester I'd taken off, and it made everything so much more stressful.

Other folks here have alluded to this but for most state schools, you have to prove 1+ years of residency to get in-state tuition. So depending on where you go, if you do want to switch to another school, you may have to choose between paying much higher tuition for the first year if you're transferring directly without taking time off—hopefully through loans you can defer until you graduate—or taking a year off to establish residency to get the lower tuition rate, but starting to pay your existing loans back in the meantime, and possibly also while you're back in school.

Traditional wisdom on this is to not mortgage your future for more convenience in the present, but your mental health is an issue of survival, not convenience. So when you're weighing your options, don't get sucked into thinking that more money out of pocket overall in the long run is automatically the worse idea no matter what. It's a factor, but it's not a trump card. It sounds like you'd be wiser to focus on trying to establish a day-to-day lifestyle that's sustainable, even if it means you end up in more debt that takes longer to pay off.

I realize this is a lot to process, and so much of it depends on your individual situation. If you want an extra brain to help soundboard all the factors and think through different options, PM me.

Also: Mood negatively affected by shitty weather + poor social support = depression. ""No passion for anything"" is also a pretty clear indicator. This isn't a criticism—just want to make sure you're being honest with yourself about this. If you have access to counseling through school, give it a shot, just to make the here-and-now a little easier.

Also, keep in mind that any advisor you speak to through the University is going to be coming from a place of how to design your future _that keeps you in academia_. If you're not sure you want to stay in school/go back to school, they're not the strongest resources for helping you think about other options.

Good luck man. Again, feel free to PM me if you want to go into more depth on any of this.

ETA: Rural PA + never lived away from home before = you've probably absorbed some, ehrm, less than worldly views and habits from your upbringing. You said in your post you want to move somewhere with diverse people, which is great; but your comment history shows casual use of racist and homophobic slurs, and no way to tell if you were trying to be funny/sarcastic or if you actually have problems with people in these groups. I'm hoping it's just mannerisms you've picked up from where you grew up and that you really do want to expose yourself to more diversity, in which case, take this as a gentle nudge in the direction of being more sensitive in the language you use. Continuing to use these types of slurs as casual insults does more harm than it probably seems in the moment, because it contributes to perpetuating habitual oppressive views as a society. Just something to think about."

JUSTNOMIL,ffse5pl,t3_eqnuky,1580179526.0,"Just mentioning this because somehow I don't see it here already but:

Armchair diagnosis: BPD. Like, _classic_ BPD. (MIL I mean, not you.)

Might not be immediately relevant to the situation you posted about, but I figure having the right terminology might help you gain insights that might help with every piece of this, including understanding her case from a clinical perspective, learning tools to help with specific communication and boundaries issues, finding some community for your husband and the shit he has to deal with from being raised by that, etc etc etc.

Maybe gently encourage your husband to check out /r/raisedbyborderlines and/or /r/BPDlovedones.

(Everyone else here already more than covered anything I would have said on the original topic. Good job, team.)

ETA: I see you already think HPD, and maybe so, or maybe both. I'm more familiar with BPD but there's a lot of overlap. Largely I mentioned it because there's also a ton of overlap between BPD and PTSD, and if you can get her a PTSD diagnosis and try to guide her towards DBT, the modules may also help with some of the problem behaviors if she also has BPD. No idea how it maps with HPD. But it might be a way to sidestep having to get the main personality disorder diagnosed (and all the conflict that's likely to cause) while still making a possible path to a smoother future.

Best of luck, in any case."
