Worst part was that i actually thought i was doing the right thing, in my mind, everyone else was trying to ruin me, but I was the one ruining myself. The whole thing lasted 8 months and i felt so happy because i felt like i was doing so good in life, but at the same time, i was so angry and wanted to die. Was so suicidal that I had three near suicide attempts but something stopped me each time, i remember the first time it was my dog who kept me from doing it.
