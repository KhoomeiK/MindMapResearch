depression,fi16v1a,t1_fi14vtx,1582051801.0,"I tend to think mine is fake to because of it being induced from a traumatic event, so in a way it is also PTSD.  But, I've noticed that when I go into those thoughts and get into that mood, it goes away when it decides to go away and I can't get out of it no matter how much I try.  Usually, it only lasts a day or two, but sometimes it can last a whole week.  It takes a strong will to do something that you aren't motivated for, but just going out and doing it anyway is sometimes the best way to overcome it.  Also, talking about your depression really helps alot, even if people don't give advice and they are just there listening, just talking about it helps.  I've noticed that and I used to be ashamed to admit that I have depression, but now I don't because I am not ashamed of it anymore and have accepted that's just a part of me.

The mind is a fragile thing, but doing things out of the norm or helping others can definitely help and eventually (hopefully) you'll come to a point that makes it manageable."

But many times I will speak, even in my family, and no one listens or refuses to answer me because I'm not the ""popular one.""  I'm sick of it, if it wasn't for my love of Jiujitsu and wanting to get a black belt at my gym, I would have moved somewhere else and started a new life because I am invisible to everyone.

depression,ff9q1jn,t1_ff9ooqg,1579718415.0,"I would very much suggest trying Jiujitsu, but that's not for everyone.  If that doesn't work try out boxing.  I can only offer advice that helped me, you might be different and need other things, but I would suggest to give it a try and see if it works out for you.  The feelings will pass eventually, but how fast or slow depends on you.  Like I said, I lingered on my ex until I got fed up with feeling that way and then aggressively tried to get myself out of it and it worked and I think that is definitely a motivator and it works.  Of course, I also progressively moved towards my goal of being free from that feeling for six months.  They were long, but worth it.

Also the thing with Jiujitsu is that it forces you to get out of your comfort zone and you'll meet some amazing people that you will train with (provided that you go to a good gym).  So, do your research on gyms around you if you decide to try it.  I hope you feel better someday, in fact I know you will!  Good luck!"

What did help me was thinking about her until I was tired of feeling that way.  We tend to not really act until it gets tiring, so push through those tears, accept what happened and go out and meet some new people or pick up a new hobby.  Eventually, everything will feel better and you will learn to live with that pain (unfortunately, it never really goes away as you will just become numb to it).

Try out Jiujitsu, or boxing or simply lifting weights, as that helped me also through my pain."

The breakup and fallout happened at the end of 2017, so it's been about two years.

Working out, at least for me, helps alot with my mental state.  I'm not one of those ""gym rats,"" it just feels good to workout and I enjoy it.  With MMA, it's more intense because I'm not just lifting weights or boxing on a bag, but I'm training myself to be better both mentally and physically.  Sparing helps alot because it teaches me to face what I'm afraid of.  A natural reaction to someone throwing a punch is to look away to avoid as much damage as possible, but that's not how you fight as you're supposed to stand your ground, absorb the punch and counter with your attack.  It's intense, and Jiujitsu to me is like taking meds to help with my depression, but it doesn't always help.  You're right as the grass isn't always greener.  As sometimes I am in class, just depressed even after rolling with people."

And I'm sorry that you went through all that, just keep your chin up and continue onward."
depression,fedw01c,t1_fedsqbc,1579021065.0,"This is actually good - reaffirmation that I'm not alone in this is good as it does feel like I'm alone constantly.  It's very interesting because from what I have noticed is that, being a man, no one wants to hear my problems as we are supposed to be tough and can handle anything.  Whenever I open up, people will either roll their eyes at me or tell me that I'm too sensitive and to get over it (insert that Simpson's meme ""I haven't thought of that yet""), yet, girls like men who are honest and sensitive, but they don't want to help carry the baggage of another man.  So what am I supposed  to do?  It's like, when I open up, people are caught of guard and don't know how to act when I become vulnerable.  Also, I believe this is one of the reasons most suicides are from men because no one wants to hear them out.

I have done therapy before, when all that stuff in my past happened because it wasn't just the girl, but close friends of mine as well, and it helped alot.  I was in a messed up place, but I forced myself to get out too and meet other people and now I am part of a great gym (Jiujitsu is basically my meds, as it helps me calm down and not think about this feeling) - that wouldn't have happened if I didn't force myself out and instead decide to just soak in my tears.  You're totally right, take baby steps to achieve what you want to achieve - and I've been doing that ever since I realized that I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life and decided to try out some dating apps.  

It also feels like I'm missing something, I think psychologists have a word for it, but it's like you feel incomplete and you're missing something that you should be in and you're feeling like an oddity in a world of normal people that have what you want/desire - which isn't necessarilly bad.  I also have to try to remember that this is all in my head and that no one really thinks this about me; well, except for those friends I had - haha, but I couldn't care less what they think anymore."

depression,fedq4tw,t1_fedpybn,1579017467.0,"I am, this didn't help and you're an ass.

I thought this was a place I could go to just rant amongst people that are going through similar situations and possibly help each other out, but apparently not."
