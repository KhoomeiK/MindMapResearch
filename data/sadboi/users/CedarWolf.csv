The Appalachian Trail is *nothing* like the Alaskan wilderness, and I can say that as someone who has hiked both. (Admittedly, I still haven't finished the AT, but I've done a few chunks of it and one of my exes has finished it.) The AT has people *everywhere*, and quiet little towns every few miles, with people who are usually happy to give you a lift into town.

The guy you're referring to, Chris McCandless, basically committed an elaborate suicide. He intentionally destroyed his credit cards and resources, he broke ties with his family, friends, and support networks, and he repeatedly turned down help and supplies from more experienced people. Then he walked into the woods, woefully unprepared, during the wrong season to be out, and got himself stuck. He got himself stuck in a situation which would have been salvageable if he had hiked a mile or so the other direction along the river, or if he had known what he was doing, or if he had recognized that he didn't have enough supplies and bailed out earlier.

The firehouse itself is not much more than a two-bay brick garage with a little room off to the side.

It reads as follows:

> On the night of October 16, 1859, Heyward Shepherd, an industrious and respected Colored Freeman, was mortally wounded by John Brown's Raiders. In pursuance of his duties as an employee of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, he became the first victim of this attempted insurrection.

> This boulder is erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of Confederate Veterans, as a memorial to Heyward Shepherd, exemplifying the character and faithfulness of thousands of Negroes, who under many temptations throughout subsequent years of war, so conducted themselves such that no stain was left upon a record which is the peculiar heritage of the American people, and an everlasting tribute to the best of both races.

What they basically mean by that is an attempt to make John Brown and his Raiders look like bad guys, for killing a black Freeman. They don't actually care one whit about Heyward Shepherd; they're just using his memory to slander someone who was notably opposed to slavery, someone who was opposed to the ideals of the Confederacy and white supremacy. They're slandering a famous abolitionist. Similarly, that 'peculiar heritage' they refer to? It's slavery. Slavery is often referred to in period documents as '[that peculiar institution](https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/peculiar-institution)' upon which the Confederacy was based. 

(Heck, [the secession documents of each state](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states) say so directly, and Mississippi's secession document even outright states ""Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world."") 

This stone memorial is little more than a way to say John Brown was bad, that some slaves were good because they were obedient, and there were good people on both sides, you guys, for realsies. Wonder where we've heard *that* in recent memory?"

girlgenius,fr2u9hf,t1_fprddrf,1589844009.0,"I forgot to mention a few. I've also read:

* [Turn Signals on a Land Raider](https://www.warhammer-community.com/tsoalr/) - Possibly *the* most iconic Warhammer 40k webcomic. It features the lives of actual minis on the tabletop as if they *were* minis on a tabletop. It ran for years, died, and was resurrected when the artist was hired by Games Workshop to come run it for them. I haven't found the original archives, yet, but I'm hoping they're out there somewhere. (I've also read almost all of the other [webcomics on the Warhammer Community site](https://www.warhammer-community.com/web-comics/), except NeverChosen - haven't read that one yet; maybe I'll read it this week.)

* [Eagle Ordinary](https://www.smackjeeves.com/discover/detail?titleNo=148679&articleNo=1) - This was a short, but delightful webcomic that's also set in the Warhammer 40k universe. The artist went on to become hired by Games Workshop to make another comic for them. It's a fun, and remarkably *accurate* look at the world of Warhammer 40k, including a lot of little notes that folks who are familiar with the setting would immediately recognize. 

* [Servants of the Imperium](https://www.servantsoftheimperium.com/comic.php) - Now ended, it's a stick figure comic in much the same vein as Order of the Stick. Indeed, it probably owes it's very existence to the Order of the Stick comic. Anyway, it follows an Inquisitor and his ragtag band of loveable misfits and semi-psychopaths towards bringing the Light of the Imperium into the many festering cesspits that lurk beneath the surface. Or something. They go places and fight bad guys. 

* [Gone With The Blastwave](http://www.blastwave-comic.com/) - This one's a post-apocalyptic comic. There's a war going on, but no one *really* seems to know who's fighting who or why. The comic itself *might* be dead, or just on hiatus again. The art is phenomenal.

.... I'm *certain* I've read another webcomic about the Mechanicus, somewhere."
todayilearned,fr2oabm,t1_fr2l4km,1589840812.0,"I just finished [Superman Smashes The Klan](https://www.dccomics.com/graphic-novels/superman-smashes-the-klan-periodical-2019/superman-smashes-the-klan), which just came out in trade paperback version on May 12th. I'm not a huge comic book fan, nor am I a fan of Superman in particular, but that story, it was *excellent*. It's a pretty faithful re-telling of the original radio show that helped bring down the actual Klan. (You can [hear the whole thing on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ol8Gmi57DI))

To my surprise, it *also* features Superman coming to grips with his own origins as an alien and an immigrant, discovering that he's been holding himself back, learning to accept his new powers and what it means to be an alien from another world instead of a super*man*, to be an alien instead of a superhuman. *And that's the B story.* It's woven in among the regular story, and it gives Superman a deeply humanizing element.

He has misgivings. He's worried about his place in the world. He's got questions. He's figuring out where he came from. He's having strange hallucinations and dealing with weakness for the first time. He's at a crossroads. He's unsure about whether he's supposed to be normal or embrace who he knows he is. There are flashbacks to Superman's childhood, moments which make him who he is as an adult. There's even a scene when Superman is getting teased as a child, called a demon, and possessed. His best friend even abandons him.

It's hard to imagine Superman having misgivings, or being teased by bullies, but there it is. Right there. It's so normal and it feels so utterly natural, and they weave that right in with the rest of the story. Even while Superman is saving the day, he's secretly grappling with who he is and how to save himself. I've never felt such empathy for Superman before; he's always seemed like an invulnerable, invincible fantasy character. He's always seemed like a fantasy; nice to have, and nice to wish for, but he's never felt *real* before.

I had no idea they were even going to bring this second story into it. They give the character of Tommy Lee's little sister a lot of agency and they let her drive a lot of the story. Her path towards finding herself and becoming comfortable in her new community helps Superman find himself, too. Each teaches the other, every person in the story has something to contribute; it's *fantastic*.

There's even a kid in the story who is *certain* Superman must smell like cotton candy, and almost every time this kid pops up in the story, he's associated with cotton candy in some way... but towards the end, he sees Superman for the first time, and he discovers that Superman does *not* smell like cotton candy - he smells like *ash*. The *same* ash and rot smell that Superman associates with Kryptonite and the death of Krypton. 

It's a subtle highlight that Superman may *look* like a shiny, saccharine story, but underneath all the fluff and color, there's something solid and real. Superman stands for ideals, for morals and truth; those are things that are nice, and easy to say, and just as easy to dismiss, but they are forged in iron and steel. Superman is driven by his convictions. They are who he is.

The whole book is like that. It's a story about people standing up for what is right and coming together simply because it's the right thing to do. It may be a Superman book, but it's a story about *people*. Flawed, fallible, fighting, forgiving, *wonderful* people.

I've never sat and waited for a comic book to come out before, but since I knew the history of this story, I'd been waiting for this book to drop for months. (I even bought the true story behind this one, the book [Superman versus the Ku Klux Klan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11407829-superman-versus-the-ku-klux-klan), by Rick Bowers. Somehow, I even managed to buy it twice by accident, and it, too, is an excellent read.) Now that I finally have the comic, I couldn't put it down; I read it cover to cover, including the essay at the end. The last few pages of the book are the author's take on history, discrimination, and his own relationship with Superman; what that character means to him.

*It's SO good.* Heck, I've just finished reading it a few minutes ago, and I already want to read it again just because I wrote this comment."

> The cost for these procedures would range from $2.4 million to $8.4 million per year, an increase of 0.4 to 0.13 percent in health care spending. That is, according to the report, ""an amount that will have little impact on and represents an exceedingly small proportion of (Active Component) health care expenditures... and overall DoD health care expenditures.""

Furthermore, the military spends far more on Viagra than it would on trans healthcare. Just on Viagra, by itself, not including other erectile dysfunction treatments.

> *Military Times* analysis of Defense Health Agency data that showed in 2014, the Pentagon spent $84.24 million on 1.18 million prescriptions for eight different erectile dysfunction drugs like Cialis and Levitra. That accounts for the comparison being 10 times higher than the RAND Corp.’s high-end estimate of $8.2 million.

> The tab for Viagra alone, which was prescribed more than 905,000 times, was $41.6 million. Some outlets chose to focus on how the bill for that particular drug was five times higher than the RAND estimate.

Similarly, we've spent more on Trump's trips to Mar-a-Lago than we would spend on transgender healthcare. During his first 80 days in office, Trump went to Mar-a-Lago six times, for a total of 21 days, at a cost in excess of $20 million.

The article I linked goes on to say that the price of transgender soldiers' healthcare would be approximately 1% of what the military spends on military bands, and roughly equivalent to 1/4th mile of the border wall that Trump is trying to build."

And yet, despite all of the above, roughly 20% of trans folks have served in the military. Trans folks enlist at a little over twice the rate that cis folks do."

It's also from the first part of the comment I wrote. I came back later and added more typos to the middle section as I found them. One thing I didn't mention was an 'ability' followed by a space, then a comma, when it should have been 'ability,' without the extra space.

Also, 'Gulliman' only has two Ls, not three.

news,fqsgytg,t1_fqsfq91,1589607002.0,"The white flag of the Confederacy, the 'Stainless Banner' was supposed to represent purity and the white race. 

>On April 23, 1863, the *Savannah Morning News* editor William Tappan Thompson, with assistance from William Ross Postell, a Confederate blockade runner, published an editorial championing a design featuring the battle flag on a white background he referred to later as ""The White Man's Flag."" In explaining the white background, Thompson wrote, ""As a people we are fighting to maintain the Heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race; a white flag would thus be emblematical of our cause.""

It was also supposed to be distinctive and easy to see in battle, but after using it for two years, from 1863 to 1865, it was replaced with the 'Blood Stained Banner,' which was the same flag, except with a big, red stripe down the far side. They had to change it because it got dirty too easily, but also because it looked too much like a white flag of truce or surrender."

The Confederate Army didn't have a standardized battle uniform at first, either, which also caused mix-ups. They had to change both because Confederates were firing on their own men.

Meanwhile, the 'Confederate' flag that people see everywhere was the Battle Flag of Northern Virginia. It had been consigned to the trash heap of history until it suddenly became popular again around the 1950's and 1960's, right around the Civil Rights Era.

It was *never* the flag of the Confederacy."
