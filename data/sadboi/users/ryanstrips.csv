It’s been a few years since then, and I’m still suffering from depression. My counselor has missed sessions with me quite a few times. She hasn’t been coming to sessions for over 3 weeks.. I just want to be better because it’s just miserable. I’m always crying and questioning why I’m alive. I also hyperventilate when I cry, and it’s really stressful.. 😭"

I’m always just so empty and I’ve been feeling really suicidal these past few years. I don’t know why people always yell at me, I don’t know why I cry when people yell at me, even once my sister told me she hates me as a joke, but I went in my room.. and cried for over an hour and I eventually— when they left— went back in the living room, covered up with a blanket, and proceeded to sob. My brother walked in and asked me why I was crying, I said that I wasn’t, and that I was just sick. He told my mom. I don’t remember the rest."

She became friends with a shit head named Abby. She stopped talking to all of her friends and started only hanging out with Abby. Abby always pulled her pants up to her fucking chin and pulled her shirt up so you can see her fucking ass. 
I confronted my friend about it and she gave me the most b.s. excuse in the fucking world. She said, “you just don’t ever ask me to talk to you”. Like, bitch— who the fuck is gonna ask you to talk to them?
Definitely not me. And I don’t think anyone else is either. 😐"
AskReddit,f8vl85v,t3_e2ds1x,1574871963.0,"While there was a flood here where I live, maybe 1 or 2 years ago, I had to go to my sisters’ boyfriends’ house because our house was flooded.
I fell asleep on some oxygen tanks and I don’t know how I fell asleep there because I’m really picky about being comfortable.
But anyways, when I woke up, I saw I was sleeping on oxygen tanks and just got up because it was really awkward but I didn’t care because if I had stayed at my house, I could’ve died— this is because in front of our house we had a house with a big hill for bulldozing and all that, tractors.. etc.
So the rain was really bad and the hill wasn’t professionally shaped if that’s what it’s called. So the hill could easily slide off of the ground onto the road and most likely hit our house into a river."

We’re in 11th grade now.
We’re still dating.
I feel really bad and will never forgive myself... I have eventually developed some feelings for her. Not lovey dovey- just a comfortable feeling around her. I’m really easy to open up to things. 
😓

The first sentence was about me not being able to break up with someone, or reject someone."
