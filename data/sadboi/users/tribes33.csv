I was one of the only male students in my year that had long hair, obviously most of the girls had long hair, one of my teachers that hated me and was the headmaster of our year (I think thats what you call it) pretty much could bully people if he sees fit and I was one of them.

Well pretty much since I was the only guy with really long hair he kept saying that I have to have my hair tied up in every class or else I'd get in trouble for it to which I replied ""I dont know why I have to do it, because all the girls that I see in school dont have to, so unless youre going to make EVERYONE tie their hair then I wont do it"", after about a week or two of nagging me about it, he got way more tense every time and I was willing to play the long game lol, so after giving out to me so much he gave me in-school suspension, the strange thing was that my parents never got notified about it so to me it looks like he was just ashamed to do something so stupid since I put him on the spot and obviously didn't want it backfiring on him.

To me it worked out wonderfully because I had an entire school week of in-school suspension and it happened to be that one of my closer friends was also there for fucking around, so there was just the two of us supervised by a teacher that didn't give a fuck, we didn't really have to do much except fill out a couple pages of ""work"" which was copying stuff down, we had our own schedule so we had lunch on different times,we pretty much had the school to ourselves during lunch and the halls were pretty much empty.

There should be a risk/reward system where you have your own jungle camp marked for a stack but it only is 1/2 of the value, so you have to do two camps to get the same benefits, but at the same time an enemy jungle camp is marked and that will give you a full mark, if you kill one the other mark gets destroyed, that way you can still safely scale, but if you are deciding to risk your life to scale harder, you will stomp the game much more."
