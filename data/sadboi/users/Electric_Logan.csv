so if those guys did it they essentially got away with it. Numerous other suspects as far as I know still alive.. but they're not even going to be investigated. It's awful.

T straight up murdered Drinkwater (he's back to using 'Drinkwater' now)."
thesopranos,foybv83,t3_e8v4v1,1588169638.0,"On my current re-watch, first in years, I'm finding myself thinking this show is a comedy.. even some of the serious moments are funny such as the poison ivy in the Palmice hit, T pulling a gun out of a giant fishes mouth to hit Signore, everything about the Philly hit..

It's still a great show.. but I just love how ridiculous it is at times, how overly dramatic at some times as well.. but these guys, everything about them was funny. 

A proper moronic duo, desperately sucking up to those in a position of power, obsessed with Tony and what he thinks of them like that scene where one of them asks id Tony ""ever talks about us"" hahahahahaaaaaa! 

At the construction site where they walk up to his car ""Yo Tonaaay!"" ..""Am I supposed to be seen here you fucks?""

The bada bing scene ""Oh shit there goes Tony.. we shoulda' at least said hi.. yeah or asked him the time or something'"" hahahahaaaaaa. Yeah he really wants a couple kids he barely knows to randomly ask him the time he'll just shout at you to get a watch you dumb fucks, and then they're checking their hair, spraying something in their mouth or some shit.. and credit to him Matt actually did all right in the bathroom.. made a lil' convo, made a lil' impression, leave it there but then Sean comes up asking about business ..""You ever heard of wire taps you fuck?"" and then Sean tries to blame it on Matt for ""gettin' all quiet.. that's what you always do, you go all quiet an' leave me to do all the talkin'"" hahahaaaaa absolute idiot.

Even just the fact that Matt explicitly states he's ""back to usin' 'Drinkwater' now"" is hilarious to me.. like he can't even make his mind up about what his name should be, and I get maybe Drinkwater is a good alias for doin' dodgy shit but you're talkin' to a Capo, you don't need to use an alias with him.

And then the attempted hit on Chris.. they're driving by slow, in a car park, to do a hit.. and Sean is wearing his seatbelt and then he can't get out 'cause of it and he gets killed ohhhhh man it's freakin' hilarious, and then Matt's like ""Jizz!"" ..'cause that's Sean's nickname (I don't think I ever really got that before.. in the past I either couldn't understand what he was saying or just thought why the hell is he saying ""Jizz""?).. and then Matt just runs off shooting wildly behind him hahahaaaaaa, more likely to hit Sean again than to hit Chris shooting like that..

And then the reasoning for the hit on Chris is hilarious.. Matt excitedly comes to Richie and tells him that he and Sean shot Chris.. as a favour to Richie.. because Richie doesn't like him... ohhhhhhh man soooo freakin' funny. ""Hey I know how to get in with Richie, we should murder the boss's 'nephew' Chris because Richie doesn't like him"" HAAAAAAAAA! ..so he's all like ""you gotta' hide me, I'm with you now!"" ...bloody hell, there's no war between the crews like in season 1 you moron.


I've noticed there seems to be a recurring theme of the younger generation seeming to be such fuck ups because they're born into families, communities where they know loads of connected guys, they're raised in it, but are kinda' spoiled, privileged and given loads of opportunities, but they don't want those opportunities because they're lazy and they want the rich and fabulous lifestyle impressed upon them by the adults they grew up around, and by contemporary popular culture.. and that they seem to be basing their idea about how to make it in the mob on movies (granted this is more an inference of mine than implied by anything seen I think).

But anyway, this show is funnier than most comedies. It's freakin' hilarious, and Drinkwater and Jizz are absolutely comedy gold.. even when Jizz dies.. hilarious. Love it."

An absolute grade A moron. His scrabble words were a joke. He not only wouldn't, but couldn't, have a conversation about anything interesting, anything with even a little depth, anything of merit. I found it hilarious that Meadow somehow thought he was a great guy, saying as much when she was crying over him, because he absolutely was not. His only quality was being handsome.. that is literally it. Complete fucking moron, rude, selfish, narcissistic person, showed no respect or genuine care for anyone else.

thesopranos,fou239w,t1_fou0nzf,1588073968.0,"I just watched 4:1 in current re-watch..

..turns out the cop, Barry Haydu, had no idea what was going on. He kept saying to Chris that whoever has told him this is lying, he has no idea who Dickie Moltisanti is. ..okay so maybe he lied for self-preservation but the thing is if it's true that he was involved and was just lying to Chris, then why would he say ""whoever"" has told you this is lying? If Haydu actually was involved in some way then while trying to talk Chris out of murdering him he would be inclined to talk about what he DOES know, maybe implicate others.

So on re-watch, I think Barry Haydu had no idea whatsoever, about anything to do with Dickie Moltisanti, which only makes Tony more suspect. Despite this though, Chris said to Haydu it makes no difference because ""he (Tony) still wants you (Haydu) dead"".

When is the film set? It's before Tony's first hit then? I just assumed they were young, not necessarily teens, so figured it could be possible."

thesopranos,fosl0qn,t1_foonftp,1588032796.0,"Nice ideas, but I don't know about Junior being directly involved. ..I dunno' it feels like if Junior was DIRECTLY involved (a trigger man), then it's kinda' weird looking at the show where T and Junior never even hinted at this. T would confront people about things he knew about them, dirt he had on them.. so I think if T knew Junior took part in the hit on Dickie, then it's quite contrived that that would have never then come up in the show... even if very subtly.

His dad maybe.. what I do suspect is that much of this film is going to revolve around Dickie (clue is in the awesome title - hope they don't change it), and what happened to him.. That's probably going to be the crisis or climax point in the story.. and I suspect that there will be a major revelation such as yeah that Johnny did it, or ordered it.. or T knew who did it and hid it from Chris his whole life because the truth had the potential to cause immeasurable damage (such as that T and his crew played a part in it themselves. ..maybe even that T did it.. imagine that..). 

..I mean I always thought it seemed like T manipulated Chris to whack that cop and that T seemed to be hiding something.. I personally suspected that T was getting Chris to whack the cop because the cop knew what happened and had the potential to inform Chris.. but if that's the case then why haver the cop taken out then rather than much earlier?"
thesopranos,fosk0qw,t3_g8o470,1588032224.0,"Yeah but Tony S knew Dickie, he was older than a kid when Dickie died, so he wouldn't need Johnny to tell him about him."
thesopranos,fosiyai,t3_fmxc3b,1588031620.0,"I actually completely forgot about this (since it was first announced) until just now, and I'm currently re-watching the show for the first time in years. Exciting.

I gotta' say I really want to see the core crew paid the respect they deserve.. by being included. So yeah T and Sil are in it, but the other guys in their crew were Jackie, Puss, Ralphie kinda' (although I thought T always hated him.. you can hate a guy in your crew but another guy in the crew likes the guy).

It's great that Paulie's in it too.. but yeah man I think this would be a nice opportunity to see more of Jackie as well y'know.. he was one of the core crew so just to leave him out of the film because he was barely in the show would be insulting to the fans I think.

Would also be nice to see Tony B (unless he's all ready gone away), Artie, Feech (because of the infamous card game ting)..

Okay so now to actually talk about the cast..

- Some people seem to have a problem with Nivola as Dickie. The guy's an Italian for starters, he's a decent actor AND he kinda' looks like Michael Imperioli he's got that thing, boney thing goin' on and the long boney nose y'know. I think this appears to be one of the best casting decisions.

- Jon Bernthal - Jon is younger than Joe Siravo was playing Johnny in the '60s.. I think. Definitely looks it anyway. So, if Jon is supposed to be playing Johnny in the '80s (?) then that's bullshit.. if he's playing him in the '60s then yeah that makes sense I guess, and it's a decent fit. He does look more like Paulie than Billy Mag, but as much as I like Jon I don't think he has that great range as an actor.. although he's great within his limited range. I don't think he could play Paulie so well.

- Corey Stoll - Again hopefully he's playing Junior in the '60s otherwise it doesn't work. Would really like Junior to be a fairly significant part though so to see him in the '80s too would be nice.

- Vera Farmiga - Again as long as she's playing her in the '60s. She's decent, definitely looks the part.

- Michela De Rossi - Was Joanne Blundetto born in Italy though? That was mentioned in a video I just watched, that the role this actress is playing is of a girl from the other side who Dickie falls for.. I don't think Joanne B was born in Italy. So this suggests that either plot-twist Joanne B was not Chris's mother (maybe both his parents were killed?).. or that Chris is all ready born (actually this is more likely, considering his age, he wasn't that young) and that this actress plays a goomar.

- Ray Liotta - I could not work out who he might play.. but that makes a lot of sense. And this is actually someone I'd love to see in the film.. because he's very relevant in the first season at least, he's mentioned but we never saw him we never had any sense of who he was. I'd be interested to know why he perhaps favoured Jackie.. y'know presumably Jackie was his favourite of the young crew.. maybe he thought T couldn't handle it because he passes out like his old man?

- I don't think Joey D is playing Puss. He's the age to play a (hypothetical) brother of Puss's in the '90s/noughties.. so for this.. I dunno' maybe he's Feech? or.. I can't think who else..

- It's very cool that Michael G is in to essentially play his dad. It works, I just hope he's half as good at the least. I've not seen him in anything but it's reassuring he's done some decent stuff, another tv show. Looks the part and it's an important role in that way, so that's good.

- I dunno' on IMDb it says he's playing 'Actor'. He looks the part though. Like I said Jackie has to be in this.

- John Magaro is too old.. he's been playing people this age for like 10-15 years and it used to work because he wasn't ageing much but recently he is. He's a decent actor.. he looks the part, not sure if he could do the voice though.. although it's younger Sil so maybe it's fine.

- Billy Magnussen - I like this guy, he's good and he makes me laugh. He doesn't remind me of Paulie in any way though. I saw a photo and they gave him the wings, and a nose piece too. It's good they done that considering Billy looks nothing like the quite unique looking Tony Sirico.. but I hope it comes across well and looks well. I don't think I've ever seen Billy Mag in such a challenging role as this, he's gotta' get Paulie's unique tone, accent, manner of speaking and general mannerisms down.

Hoping for a few little references for the fans as well.. I dunno' things like Febby Petrullio, the guy Jimmy that never recovered.. stuff like that would be cool.. Tony's first hit maybe? Rocco and the jacket.."

It's true that amongst those pro bowlers there are busts, who were at least busts for the team that picked them if not in a complete sense. Prime example being Jameis Winston.. RG3 too. A more in-depth analysis that could really tell us more about the success of these draft classes would probably go into the number of pro bowl selections, or how many of the players were selected for multiple.

In truth I can't really be bothered with that though.. so just thought it'd be interesting to take a more generalised look at number of pro bowlers and how many players have stayed with the team that selected them."

That said.. all things considered I think your parents are the assholes.. so you informed the assholes.. you probably thought it was a bigger deal than it is because of your parents attitude. ..drugs are mostly a big deal because society makes it that way. Prohibition does not work.. I thought the Capone era showed us this.. and actually the legal countries like Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland are shining examples of the positive effect of legalisation. It's true. It's backed by statistics, facts. A lot of people just can't seem to get past their stigma induced bias.

And I know I sound like a hypocrite, because I said it was degenerate. That's my opinion, that doesn't change the fact that legalisation works better than prohibition.

Summary: My opinion is snorting drugs is degenerate.. it's disgusting. Specifically taking it up the nose.. grosses me out it's nasty.

..when he flung the bat behind him it hit this girl right in the face. She screamed and quickly had a waterfall of blood pouring down her face.

That guy was probably pissed because he was probably gonna get a home run."

So that’s one bit of advice is.. laugh at them. They’re idiots. Secondly you should be proud in the knowledge that you are genuinely beautiful whereas they.. well they could be but who can tell? Or maybe they aren’t. Even if they are they’re reducing their own beauty with the fake shit.

Which by the way the thing that I get attracted to, aside from personality and character, yknow in physical appearance, is natural beauty. Freckles.. actually being able to see what your skin looks like, having eye brows that don’t draw attention from the rest of your face so that I notice just how big and black they are.. those waluigi brow girls man they are delusional on an epic scale. And I love frizzy hair.. it’s not my type. I just love healthy, natural hair.. if a girl has frizzy hair and and she owns it, it’s hot man it’s a proper natural kinda peacockin.. I know you didn’t say anything about frizzy hair I’m just saying, that’s how much I love natural beauty.. 

Well I ain’t all that way inclined I do prefer them to shave legs and armpits, I dunno I don’t think that should be too much to ask for. Make-up looks best when used not at all or minimally. People who plaster their face in make-up are using it wrong.. and self sabotaging on an epic scale.

Well so that might make you feel better, that Im this way inclined. Bad news is I’ve always been a massive non-conformist not by choice but by natural inclination. I very rarely think the same as the masses, because I’m high functioning autistic that probably has something to do with that. I don’t really know what most guys prefer.. although a lot of the girls my friends are with have a lot of that awful shit I don’t dig..

I’m really picky, I don’t have any attraction to girls if I can’t tell what they look like.. which seems to be a lot of them.."

It’s rude and intrusive. If you’re a responsible adult don’t go around ordering kids you barely know to smile or patronisingly telling them they look like they’ve seen a ghost. You know very little about that kid and aside from a developmental disability they could maybe be depressed, highly anxious, be recovering from parental split, grieving, could’ve recently witnessed their mum having a nervous breakdown and no one told them what was going on so they thought their mum was dead until she came back from the hospital at which point she was catatonic and unresponsive and still not herself and their mum could have still not fully recovered, spending much time in bed and the child able to sense the suicidal capabilities of their own mother.

This is the same as the Waluigi brow...

However, if they want to be considered a beautiful, feminine, woman, and to attract heterosexual, masculine men.. then Waluiging the brow is counter-productive.
