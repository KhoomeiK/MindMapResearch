I'm convinced it's a bunch of angsty teenagers or something, angry they can't go back to school - because the disconnect from reality (and lack of basic understanding of what policy is to begin with) I have a hard time believe it's anybody adulting.

Note before anybody reading this attacks me:

--policy is always a tradeoff between various factors - in this case, economic damage and people's liberties versus saving lives.  we don't ban cars because 40k people die a year, even though these would be largely preventable.  and if the mortality rate really is only .2%, there are going to be a lot of people who think this entire thing is ridiculous.  This isn't geometry - this is opinionated calculus.

--""science"" doesn't tell you what this compromise should be - that's the realm of politics, and like with anything subjective that's an opinion, it's not determined by any objective measure, but inferred from a person's subjective opinion.  no one is right, and no one is wrong in these circumstances.  

--science, at best tells you ""the mortality rate is .2%, or 2%, or 20%"" - it doesn't tell you ""we should open up, because the mortality rate is .2% and it's not worth destroying the economy of this"" - that's the epidemiologist's opinion of the matter - not what the ""science"" is telling them.

--there are a lot of people who think the protestors are batshit crazy, but who generally think it's also ridiculous things haven't opened up already.  And the more this drags on, the more angry such people are going to get, and the more this will help trump.

--Your ignoring of the economic situation and that this is a great way to change society fundamentally (ubi, for example) demonstrates your ignorance of political change and how the real world works.  again, this leads me to believe most of these people are adolescent aged.  they don't have to worry about paying rent and surviving - because they are living with their parents, etc. 

--politicians are always scheming to gain the ""upper hand"" regardless of the situation, even in situations like this.  This is as much about politics as it is about saving lives, if not more. (does anybody remember 09/11 and the re-election of bush, anybody?)  imo there are many people who want fundamental change, and now coronavirus is their vehicle.  and since they aren't paying much in costs (again, living with parents) they don't give a hoot about the costs.

--rather than denigrating the other side, simply try to understand it.  this sort of unidimensional thinking is why trump was elected in the first place - stop being arrogant and think ""you know better"" than those ""idiots.""  there is a logic, even if you disagree.

edit: for some reason i can't reply back to the posters below, which is fine really - but you are kind of demonstrating how the aforementioned directly applies.  moreover, my mentioning of the vehicle fatalities example merely demonstrates we already engage in a utilitarian calculation to begin with - arguing against the framework used is....to argue against reality. different people have different thresholds, and that's a distinctly political discussion, not really a scientific one.  the whole point of politics is that we all have different preferences, and to come to norms which satisfy the majority.  i don't think the majority will think this is worth it if the death rate is .2%, and anybody who doesn't at least recognize that this is at least an arguable position probably doesn't pay their own bills or live in reality.

as far as ""bad logic,"" my logic is fine.  i'm merely putting this in a basic is/ought framework, the sort you should have learned in high school. which again makes me think most of you haven't graduated yet, this is elementary logic 101.  what's next - a syllogism is illogical as well?

Flatten the curve makes rational sense, to a certain point.  However, stopping the spread does not - this is/will spread, all that we are doing is slowing that down.

(just like whether the 2nd iraq war helped ""fight"" the terrorism war)  Of course certain proponents are stating such, but it'd be the same if the distancing was actually ineffective and the mortality rates are just far lower.  Speaking of which, btw - Most of the initial figures given of millions of people dying were bunk to begin with, ridiculously high with mortality rates of five, ten percent.  Obvious selection bias.

This sums up the opposing view quite well, and still seems relevant today:

https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/

The point being, however - there is debate on whether current measures were / are really necessary, and asking legitimate questions with empirically backed data needn't be shouted down if the conclusions disagree with the current narrative.  The lack of context I've seen on TV as well as internet media on these numbers (and it doesn't take a genius to understand the basics) has been ridiculous.  

Now personally, even if the rates were tripled to 200k at the max, I would still question whether current measures are actually worth the lives involved.  (and even without social distancing i'm not convinced it would reach this number) Considering what we view as acceptable losses to traffic fatalities, normal influenza every year - even suicide and the like I find it difficult to believe that when compared to other deaths 100k additional is that big of a deal.  

Again - the point being anybody bringing up such opposing views is immediately shouted down, which I can't really understand why.
