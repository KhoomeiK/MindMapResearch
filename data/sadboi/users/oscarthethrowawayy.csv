I’m not sure what to say, exactly, but my 85 year old grandfather had a serious stroke two years ago. He was on life support for weeks, and my family was told that we shouldn’t be too hopeful. Because even if he did survive- he would not be able to walk or talk again. Today, he is living independently with my grandmother, giving his dog long walks around the block, and giving me calls a few times a week. The human brain is truly resilient. I am praying for you and her. 

As for now, it’s a horrible period of unknown and waiting. Please please please take care of yourself.

Parenting,fm115vv,t3_fsc7mi,1585670079.0,"One of my closest friends is a mtf trans woman. 
She went through therapy for a long time before she and her doctors mutually decided that transitioning would be the best decision for her happiness. 

I wouldn’t encourage nor discourage transitioning- but please be there to listen and support. Maybe find a therapist before making any decisions on moving forward because a lot of things can be mistaken for gender dysphoria, especially at that age. 

And if it turns out, that transitioning is the best choice, please just be loving and supportive. Having watched my friend go through her transition- she had to deal with so much hate and prejudice, even though she was just trying to live her life and harm nobody. But watching that process was difficult, I wouldn’t wish it on anybody. I secretly wished that she would just wake up one day in the body that she should have had, so she wouldn’t have to struggle anymore. She’s much happier now, though, and it’s an amazing thing to see. 

If your child is expressing these feelings, know that it’s serious. Please just give them as much love and support as you can- and finding a good therapist can help navigate through anything else."
