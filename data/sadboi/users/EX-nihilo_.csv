death,f77i4sf,t3_dmeu95,1573457808.0,Im going to say what a lot of people on here wont. Im still alive because frankly I like most of us am a little bitch.
death,f72tibe,t3_du75tx,1573378760.0,"Im 26 and in the same boat. the scary part is it feels not long ago i was your age. And soon youll be mine. it really does happen that fast. All you can do is spend as much of your time doing what YOU want to do. This is the one life you get and it is far to short to waste a minute of it. The great news is you are still young and have not yet wasted much time. Go out and do that thing you want, go approach that girl/boy you like, stand up to that asshole that holds you back, because all to soon it will be to late."
depression,f72sahn,t3_clue8y,1573376857.0,Im in the same boat. my advise? Do let it worry you. If the right time comes then it comes. until then then try to stay preoccupied. And if it doesnt happen then good for you man. but Its a sad reality that a lot of us were never meant to be part of this world.
