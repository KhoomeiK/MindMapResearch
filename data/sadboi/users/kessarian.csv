bipolar,fqkscxc,t3_gjehv6,1589434928.0,"Personally I'd prioritize that list. They don't all sound like ASAP items to me, and you're entirely right that fixing them all at once is overwhelming. Here's my suggestion. Modify it as you see fit!

Top of my list: teeth brushing (feels good & cardio health), more balanced diet (tastes good & everything health). 

* For teeth, set an alarm on your phone for teeth brushing, same time every day. It's a quick thing to do & you'll feel accomplished. 
* For diet, sounds like there are other people in the household. Maybe have a meeting to figure out what sorts of healthier veggie options would be both easy to make & appealing to everyone. Once you have a menu, just rotate through making those recipes. You can forget about having to try to incorporate veggies, it'll just happen automatically

Middle of my list: picking and sticking to a sleep schedule (improved mood), exercise (feels good & cardio health)

* For sleep, consistently getting 8-9 hours (at the same time each night) is ideal. If you naturally get up later and your job allows you to do that, why not get up later? sleeping from 2am to 10am is still sleeping 8 hours. Aim for a consistent schedule first. Then if you want to, you can inch it up slowly, maybe no faster than half an hour per day as if you were getting over jetlag. It's also useful to have a reason why you're waking up early, like a fun morning thing you'd never do later in the day
* For exercise, you're already doing 10 minutes & that's great! use it! push the walk a little longer, maybe add 5 minutes a week until you're going on 30 minute walks. Don't try to do too much too quickly. Then you can think about adding other stuff. With exercise, there's always more you /could/ be doing, but doing something is sooo much better than doing nothing

Bottom of my list: showering

* Find your ideal frequency. It's probably higher than weekly but it's probably lower than daily (showering too much can dry out skin). Some people say 2 days on/ 1 day off, some say every other. It can also depend on season (more in the summer) or your activity level. Then, figure out why you're not doing it. No time? Tie it to something you already do at a set time, like right after you get in from a walk with the dog (bonus, if the dog just peed, it won't have to while you're in the shower). Something else? knowing what the mental block is can help you find a solution.

tldr, don't do everything at once, prioritizing & building slowly are your friends"

bipolar,fgho5j6,t3_eyg5rk,1580789380.0,"I was on it for 2 wonderful months before mania hit. I felt good and productive and then I had a bunch of unprotected sex and stopped sleeping and started driving really recklessly and couldn't sit still and bought things.... etc. etc. etc... Fortunately I had people to take care of me and who intervened before I did anything truly life ruining/threatening. Weened off it over the course of a week and immediately started depakote which put me to sleep for 14-16 hours a day the next 2 months. Don't really remember much of the period, but something got switched in my brain because I get cravings for cymbalta now, even though it's 2 years later.

Despite wanting it badly, I have every reason to warn people against it and actively do."

SOO hopefully these habits stick around if/when things happen in the future. I might end up having to cancel them someday \*shrug \*"
bipolar,fecev4y,t3_eof8go,1578972250.0,"My budgeting is pretty simple because my life is simple. I have a spread sheet with categories (rent, food, dog care, phone, car insurance, etc) and budget amounts for each. Some are obvious because they're the same every month, some I estimate by looking at a couple months' worth of credit card statements.

The money that is needed for that stuff is money I can't touch except for that stuff. If I'm overspending what I think I should be spending (ie, I budget 200 for food but consistently spend 250), I change the budgeted amount for that category to reflect reality. This lets me have a good idea of what to expect each month and with that info I can make sure I have a positive income.

Of course, it's fun to spend, so I intentionally budget 'mad money.' This is the amount of money I allow myself to spend on whatever I want. Usually what I do to make sure I stay on budget in this category is wait until the end of the month and then go on a mini spree.

EVERYTHING ELSE goes into CDs/ savings accounts/ Roth IRAs at companies OTHER THAN MY MAIN BANK so I don't see that money sitting there when I log in to check balances. It's effectively gone, because I can't access it without dumb penalties, so I don't even let myself see it.

 There are the times when you want to go on a spending spree and it's not the end of the month or you don't want to stay within a budget. For this I actually turn to games like sims. I can make as much money as I want via cheat codes and then spend it as much as I want because it's fake. That trick probably won't work for everyone, but in my case the feeling is similar enough to actually buying things that it's a good way to avoid winding up with a huge bill."
bipolar,fe35v0u,t1_fe2yg1k,1578846212.0,"talk to an adviser? Often the ""rules"" are more flexible than they seem. Also I found it really useful in college to spend some quality time with the course catalogue and chart out my courses for myself, rather than follow the prescribed progression. It gave me more freedom, and I graduated on time with two majors"
bipolar,fe0hyux,t3_enkfm5,1578813723.0,"I feel like you gotta stop thinking of yourself as a scam. Yeah, you've got some baggage, but everyone does to some extent, him included.

For me when I'm sending difficult emails or texts, I just set a timer for myself. I'll write it out, then wait to hit send for a specific amount of time, 1-2 minutes, reread it, then decide whether to send or edit it. That's saved me from sending some very emotionally charged messages in the past.

For the phone calls... idk. Try to take steady breaths and focus on what he's saying rather than all the ideas popping up in your head (if you get that). Listen intentionally so you make sure you know how to respond appropriately. Maybe if he calls you out on it tell him that you've had a bit too much coffee. It's gonna be tricky to keep that up for an hour, but I don't have other ideas. Best of luck!"
bipolar,fe0gczq,t3_eng7aw,1578812993.0,Do you need to take so many classes?
bipolar,fe0g80k,t3_enildy,1578812917.0,"Yeah, I'm like that too. I'm way too sensitive about how others respond to me, often thinking that a slight social misstep on my part will completely ruin the friendship or that some accidental slight against me (like interrupting a story I'm telling because something abruptly caught their attention) means they hate me, or that I should just not talk because it's not important to anyone which sends me spiraling into 'they don't value me, I'm worthless, I hate myself etc."" 

Been talking to my therapist a lot about this one. Seems to be mellowing out as I become more aware of it and as a result become able to calmly let the people around me know that it's bothering me which prompts them to reassure me or promise to be more aware of things like interrupting. Maybe worth a shot?"
bipolar,fe0fb6v,t3_enkb9b,1578812436.0,"looks like such a cozy space, loved looking at your pictures! Kinda doing something similar in my room right now, decided to paint a mural on the wall by my bed"
bipolar,fe0eyqj,t3_enjk1j,1578812229.0,"I know you don't want to hear this answer, but if you're making a plan you need to be in the hospital. It may be different this time, provide you with some much needed stability in this time of upheaval and get you back on meds. 

Also, this may sound trite, but school isn't everything. It took a long time for me to believe that, but I do hardheartedly now. Getting a degree changes how some people perceive you socially, but it isn't an automatic ""get a job"" card. Honest advice, find some stability for yourself, get a job, think about college when you're more okay. College is a stressful environment full of potential depressive and manic triggers, you really only get out of it what you put in, plus a ton of debt. 

Further, I know you probably don't feel young but you're SUPER young. I'm young. I'm 25. I've felt like my life was completely over. I made some changes to my life (in my case leaving graduate school was exactly what I needed to do). It was completely terrifying. It meant discarding a version of myself that I'd built up as the ONLY option, but life is full of options and will take you in so many unanticipated directions that any road map you might conceive for yourself is guidelines at best. You have a future, just gotta give it a chance to show up. Sometimes giving it that chance is really hard, and that's why we need social support.

Finally, on your questions of grief. I'm still learning on this, I lost my grandpa three days ago. I kinda wrote this for myself but maybe it'll help

Step 1) I'm telling literally everyone I interact with, and people immediately offer help. I'm accepting that help. I'm having friends call me and buy ice cream for me and go see movies with me. I even told a stranger I met on facebook marketplace while buying a table, and when I arrived to pick up the table she immediately gave me a box of tissues and a cup of tea. 

Step 2) I'm staying busy with art projects to avoid dwelling, but I'm keeping it balanced, letting myself cry when I feel I need to, trying not to bury anything while also manage it. That sounds tricky and it is, but it boils down to taking care of yourself, getting enough sleep, making myself nap if I don't get enough over night. I'm making myself eat three meals, even though typically I'll skip one. This grief isn't typical, so my routine is slightly off from typical.

Step 3) I'm giving myself time. Immediately after he died I wanted to be okay. I buried a bunch of emotions and then wondered why I wasn't feeling ""upset enough"" (see also, comment history). I need time to be not okay, he's not even in the ground yet. 

So that doesn't really help ""how do you get through it?"" since I'm still in it, but it's a strategy that seems decent enough, maybe it'll help. 

So sorry for your loss, here's to taking the coming days one step at a time"

bipolar,f74ok2y,t3_dub8mh,1573405697.0,"Hey, I'm 25, and my parents have been slowly splitting up over the past 4 years, just finally signed the papers two months ago. It was a really difficult thing for me. I leaned heavily on my therapist during that time. Friends didn't seem to understand why I was upset. Those who did offer something would say ""don't think it's your fault,"" which I guess is something kids think when their parents divorce, but that wasn't what bothered me. I was upset about the feeling that my family was breaking apart completely. My older sister was off living with her husband, I was 12 hours away from home. Mom and dad being together felt like the last thing keeping the four of us together, plus they were selling my childhood home, and I felt like that meant losing my access to many happy memories. I realized I had to really put in the effort to keep those memories alive for myself and to keep the individual relationships up. **It was no longer me and my parents, it was me and mom and me and dad. I also had to put boundaries up;** mom would often try to talk about her problems with dad while I was stuck as a captive audience (ie in the car), which was awful. Dad told me he still loved my mom, which kept a hope alive in me that they'd work things out, and that made things hurt more. Just remember, **you're allowed to grieve something like this.** It hurts just like any other loss. You're also still their child. Whatever their problems, they can still afford some time to listen to your concerns. If you're scared as I was of losing your relationships with them, **talk to them, figure out a way to move forward with the new family structure**.

My heart goes out to you. I know how much this hurts"

bipolar,exjbonr,t3_ct8jap,1566346376.0,"Hey there, the most helpful advice I ever got was to stop looking for a label to put yourself in a box and start looking for a label that gets you help. The reason to get diagnosed is purely to find the right treatment for you. There are certain meds that folks with bipolar should not be on, and the diagnosis gives the doctors a good idea of what classes of meds to try. While a label might help contextualize things for you, there's never going to be a 100% fit. Every bipolar patient experiences things differently. I, for one, really struggle to accept my diagnosis because the only time I've ever been hypomanic was when I was on an SNRI. Outside of that, I just get really depressed, which to me doesn't look like bipolar at all, but I'm not a doctor. All I know is the lamictal sorta helps, so I'm grateful for that and try not to fixate too much on the fact that I really don't think I'm actually bipolar.

That's not to say that doctors are infallible. You should still 100% be an advocate for yourself and make sure your symptoms are entirely understood by your provider so they can provide the best care possible, and if it seems like they're really off, there's no reason not to get a second opinion.

Hope that helps!"
