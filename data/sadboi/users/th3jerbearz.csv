When it comes to housing, while there may be modest increases in prices renters will have more autonomy because they have $1000 extra to spend.

A UBI of, say, $1000 a month would allow many on the streets to room with one or two others, keep yourselves fed and find a job. Not to mention the overall increase in QOL for 94% of citizens AND the major boon to the economy a UBI would be. 

Currently in Canada, for every $1 we spend on the Canada Child Benefit (A UBI for Parents with children under 18) we get $2 back into the economy.
