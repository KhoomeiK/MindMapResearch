SexAddiction,fqqzopl,t3_gkg57y,1589574895.0,"I have pretty much the opposite problem as you lol. My husband asks a lot of questions about my recovery process and I find it overwhelming so we have a communication script we follow that might work for you in reverse. Basically after I go to therapy or a meeting, he will ask “is there anything you talked about in your group that you feel like sharing?” Then I can choose to either share a couple of thoughts or keep it private and he has to accept that. Perhaps you could say to your wife “I had an awesome meeting, is it okay if I share a couple of thoughts I had?” That gives her a choice. She might have had a hard day and hearing details about your addiction could be damaging at that moment. Or she could be in a positive space and hearing about your growth is an opportunity for you guys to connect and strengthen your marriage."
SexAddiction,fqms6f0,t1_fqmn24p,1589482635.0,"Okay, thanks for your reply. Honestly the way you phrased your post it seemed like you were an addict looking for advice on how people act in groups. When I watched your video where you are  doing the whisper share, I felt triggered like you were making fun of sex addicts. Maybe in your post you could mention you are doing research on how to behave in meetings so people don’t get the wrong idea."
SexAddiction,fqmftzj,t3_gjnfj3,1589476745.0,I’m so confused by your post history. Did you make an ASMR whisper video pretending to share in a sex addiction group? Or are you actually a sex addict?
SexAddiction,fq5fh18,t3_ggwsdg,1589103373.0,"Trust your gut, you mentioned that it already feels too intimate to juggle with your recovery sounds like a red flag. In my opinion I would pause the relationship to work on myself trusting that my foundation of friendship with this person will see you guys through when you’re in a better place. I have prior experience with non monogamy and I would warn you that it can be very triggering for a sex addict to be involved with."
SexAddiction,fpszny9,t3_gfdy0a,1588882342.0,I mean if you’re having unprotected sex with strangers this might be true but I feel like then you just end up with porn addiction. Then porn will stop satisfying your urges and you will wind up back where you started. I’ve done the whole trading one addiction for another and it just led me to more unhappiness.
SexAddiction,fppb5jc,t3_gerur9,1588799107.0,"Couple of things I do to stay grounded and avoid the downward spiral. Play the whole tape, basically think about what consequences will happen if you act out. Exercise! I do a set of 30 sit ups and then 15 pushups repeat until I want to vomit or no longer feel like acting out. Call a friend who understands what you are going thru. Clean a room in your house. Write a list of things you are grateful for in your life. Tapping (EFT) is also very helpful for me for stopping negative thought patterns."

SurvivingMyInfidelity,fohjjsr,t1_fohcf94,1587767022.0,"Well I don’t know if I have a succinct answer but here goes. Step one is accepting what I did, I was the one in control of my actions and my choices no one else. Step 2 understanding that I can’t take it those choices back and that I have to live with them. Step 3 understanding that guilt and self pity for my choices does nothing to help my husband get better. Step 4 understanding why I made the choices I did and how to prevent myself from every putting myself in a position where I could possibly make those choices again. Step 5 making real amends for the wrong that I have done to my husband, basically being the best partner I can be for my husband. Step 6 passage of time. My husband and I are 2.5 years out from DD and I would say it took me a year to fully forgive myself."

SexAddiction,foatpdw,t3_g6lctb,1587652343.0,I identify with a lot of what you said and I also felt like I couldn’t stop. I’m sorry your therapy wasn’t helpful. It’s hard when you put yourself out there to find help and not getting the support you need. For me meetings and meeting with a good sex therapist has been what works for me. You are on the right track though! You came here and asked for help and that’s a huge step in the right direction. I know getting healthy is overwhelming but the peace and self satisfaction that comes with recovery is worth it. You deserve to look in the mirror and like who you see.

My husband and I have fought really hard at staying together and sometimes it’s still difficult. I feel like now after all the work and compromises we have put into our relationship we are at that spot that you want to be in when you talk about marriage being a safe space. Focus on figuring yourself out before reaching for a marriage to give you safety. Best of luck sending you good vibes."

SexAddiction,fn2rtu5,t3_fygnp8,1586600751.0,For me I don’t think the end goal of sexual recovery is to become asexual. For me I define it as moving from using sex as a way to make myself feel better to having sex be an expression of an intimate loving connection with my husband. There are kinky elements that he and I do but it’s a consensual balanced experience.  They are circumstances that have to be in place in order for us to have sex so that I don’t become triggered and I’d be happy to discuss privately with you if you would like to DM me. I would talk about it here but it might be triggering for some people to read.

The crazy thing to me is I haven’t spoken to them in over 2 years so they would have had to search me specifically to find it. I think I’m going to block them but I’m nervous.

AsOneAfterInfidelity,fjem62e,t1_fjeici2,1583274185.0,You hit the nail on the head. When I got home from work I had a talk with my husband urging him again to go to therapy for his issues with ptsd which was met with “why are you making me go to therapy?” He feels like I cheated for 2 years so why does he have to be mentally healthy after 2 and a half years. He ended the conversation sooner than I would have liked but we agreed I would go back to therapy and he can continue on as he would like. Basically Im praying that he sees me progress and become healthier and happier and it encourages him to do the same.

AsOneAfterInfidelity,fjdwi91,t1_fjdpwp1,1583260615.0,"I really appreciate your thoughtful response, it really is a tough situation. I have offered countless times to install location trackers on my cell but in his words he doesn’t want to have to track me and I could probably get around it anyway if I wanted to. I do keep my cell unlocked and he has the password to my laptop. I have definitely noticed that he is triggered by the sounds my phone makes so a couple of months ago every time I get a text notification I read out loud who the text is from and what it says. I take pictures on my phone when I’m away from him as protection but since he has a track phone doesn’t like when I send him pics because it uses too many minutes. I don’t want to use an ultimatum on him but I just don’t know how our relationship can survive unless he gets help for his triggers. I feel like when we first reconciled that he was putting a lot of energy into looking at himself and making our marriage work and now it is back to the same energy as before I started cheating."

AsOneAfterInfidelity,fhh6xbt,t1_fhh5me9,1581595994.0,Very true. The first Valentine’s Day after my cheating was revealed I made my husband a card that said “I know I’m not easy to love but I’m so happy that you decide to love me anyway and I will spend everyday proving to you that I’m worth loving”. The thing about reconciliation is it’s the WW responsibility to make amends for the wrongs they’ve done but it’s the BS responsibility to manage their feelings and learn to love the new relationship that is formed after the original vow has been broken. I hope your husband puts in the work on himself and proves that he is deserving of your 2nd chance.
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fhh0jey,t1_fhgjc31,1581587978.0,I completely understand where the you both are coming from but what’s the right move for a WW?

I had kinda a weird last couple of days that has left me feeling a bit disassociated and I’m wondering if that spurred me to act out. It kinda feels similar to my decision to quit drinking, at my workplace free alcohol is readily available and when someone hands me a beer I don’t even think about it I just start drinking. Then I remember I’m trying to stop drinking, feel like shit about myself, go hide in my office and start doing shots by myself. Same with my phone. It’s in my hand and my brain just went on autopilot and went straight to a porn reddit."

SexAddiction,fgyvn7s,t1_fgye4pz,1581187663.0,"I know it seems that way right now but it’s just not true. Your desire to turn yourself in furthers confirms what I said before. Basically if you turn yourself in to police you’re looking at a 2nd degree sexual assault which in the US carries a 9 month minimum sentence but because of your age and the fact that you both were under the influence a judge would probably suspend your sentence and make you go to sexual rehabilitation. I know you want to release yourself from your guilt but do realize that you are dragging your victim back into this. You said she wants to put this behind her and since I’ve been in the position that she is in that’s probably the truth. It’s not so simple that she can just write a statement and be done. The cops will want to interview her probably more than once and will pressure her to press charges which if she does will involve multiple court appearances. If you want to stop living a lie get yourself into an inpatient treatment and get yourself some help! I know that kids of your generation feel like if you’re not finishing high school early and halfway they law school by the time you’re 20 that your life is over but it’s just not true. Please get yourself some help, the little kid in you that got abused by his uncle deserves a second chance."
SexAddiction,fgwdxkn,t1_fgw4yls,1581160079.0,"It is fucking really difficult. I feel stagnant currently and it’s driving me crazy. I can’t go to meetings because I haven’t told my husband yet that I’m seeking help for my sex addiction so I can’t get better. I’m also trying to quit drinking and I’m failing pretty spectacularly at that as well. I think I’m going to write my husband a letter telling him what’s going on because I’m scared if I don’t have something to read I’ll get too nervous and fuck it up. I feel like I can give people good advice but I can’t take it for myself. But anyway today is a new day and a new chance to make a new beginning.

Edit: one more thought for you. When I’m starting over after a run of acting out I do the following. Think about what made me choose to act out and own it, Then I forgive myself, and finally I make a plan for how to avoid acting out in the same way again."
SurvivingMyInfidelity,fgvpydq,t3_f0nk3o,1581151653.0,"Okay I just want to clarify a couple things because I’m confused from your post. You cheated and Dday was 2 months ago? Then in the last 2 months you offered your BS an open relationship? Why did you offer to open the relationship up? Was it for your benefit or your BS? 

Edit: sorry I read through more carefully. So for dealing with your feelings about this woman remind yourself of a couple of things: she was a support to him when you were not an option. You are lucky that your BS had someone he could confide in, my husband did not have that option and it almost killed him. When you feel jealous or uneasy remind yourself that your BS chose to stay with you even after you hurt them. That’s a pretty committed decision. I think it’s normal for a WW to feel uneasy like you do but part of our healing process is to trust that our BS isn’t going to hurt us like we hurt them. I mean we know how easy it is to start cheating which is why she probably makes you feel uncomfortable but remember our BS feel that way all the time. Good luck!"
FoodPorn,fgsj5hc,t3_f02u4i,1581085665.0,Can I give you a couple tips? Once you stretch your croissant pieces let them rest for 5 mins before you roll them up. The way they are unrolling while baking suggests the dough is not properly relaxed so they are trying to pull themselves apart as they bake. Also I would invest in a spray bottle for your egg wash so you get a more even coating.

SexAddiction,fgs9cls,t3_f050bk,1581077335.0,"I just want to say you’re not a monster. Monsters don’t care if they hurt people, they don’t lay in bed at night hating themselves, they don’t want to fix the problems that they know they have. The things your family did to you as a child are terrible and were not your fault in anyway, but now as an adult it’s your job to get the help you need to make sure you correct your behavior before your addiction escalates. I know it feels like your life is over but you really have so much time to become a healthy happy whole person. I first started going to NA meetings when I was 16 years old and I wish I had stuck around would’ve prevented a lot of regret in my life."

If you believe in god then that can be your higher power, if that doesn’t work for you there are other things you can believe in."
SEXAA,fgmpw5l,t3_eyp5a4,1580929636.0,I like this action for today as I struggle with trusting other people. Can you give some more examples of ways that I can practice trust?
BPD,fgmekn1,t1_fgmdkxp,1580922992.0,Ok boss 👍🏼
BPD,fgm5h3d,t1_fgm4h8a,1580918335.0,I never actually argued with them? Reporting someone who has made a throwaway account just for the purpose of trolling does nothing as they probably have several other accounts to troll from. Sorry if you feel like it’s ramping up drama it’s honestly just fun for me.
BPD,fgm2t8v,t1_fgm29go,1580916866.0,I agree totally. I’m just glad I’m feeling happy and on an upswing today so their comments genuinely made me laugh. The only thing that sucks is when trolls come out swinging and I’m already feeling suicidal then things can go down hill quickly.
BPD,fglw4uu,t1_fgltwda,1580912371.0,"Nah no pity party here but thanks for looking at. Since you obviously have been stalking my post history you should see that if nothing else I’m completely honest about who I am on here. What was it about me that’s got you so triggered? 

As for the recipe cheating on your husband is optional but I don’t recommend it."
BPD,fglshpo,t1_fglpkww,1580909840.0,"Oh those are definitely my words,my thoughts, and my feelings. Your actually quite right I’m fucked up dumpster fire of a person and I don’t deserve the love and affection I receive from my husband and my family. I keep wondering what it is they see in me cause I sure don’t. I’m glad to have a healthy outlet for you mental illness otherwise you might be left to lash out at strangers looking for help on the internet. Now on to the recipe! It’s in grams though so you will need a scale to complete 

Preheat oven to 450
Dice 400 grams of rhubarb and toss with 200g sugar, 10g vanilla paste, 5g kosher salt. Bake on a silpat (silicon baking mat) until the rhubarb has some color then set aside to let cool. 

Turn down oven to 350 for baking the cakes
In a stand mixer paddle 

120g butter

200g sugar

Once light and fluffy add 2 eggs and continue to paddle till homogeneous 

Sift together 

245g flour, 2 t baking powder, 1/2t salt, 

Add sifted dries and then fold in 240g sour cream

Pour 1/2 batter into buttered and floured 9 inch cake pan then add the roasted rhubarb followed by 2nd 1/2 of flour. Top with your favorite streusel recipe and bake for approximately30-45 minutes.  Let cool and then enjoy knowing that you are a better person than I will ever be."
BPD,fglouzm,t1_fglnowh,1580906736.0,"Oh hi u/local-rhubarb that’s a good thought. Thank you for your kind words. Just wondering did you make this alt account just for me, makes me feel really special if you did. Your dedication to helping others who are going thru a hard time really warms my heart. Btw rhubarb is one of my favorite summer fruits. Please let me know if you would like the recipe for my rhubarb sour cream crumb cake, it’s delicious =)"
SurvivingMyInfidelity,fglm0dl,t3_ez7p3w,1580903880.0,I think it’s most important to build up your emotional connection first. In the case of my husband no amount of me telling him I preferred him did any good. It was only once we had been in reconciliation for awhile and I continued to demonstrate my love for him non sexually that he began to believe me. But I think some part of him will always believe that I cheated because our sex life wasn’t satisfactory.
