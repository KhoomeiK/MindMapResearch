BorderlinePDisorder,fqqgbzf,t3_gkcxoq,1589565033.0,"Not sure if this is exactly what you‚Äôre looking for, but I saw someone give a really great analogy for BPD and rapid mood swings. It‚Äôs like when you‚Äôre petting a cat and everything is fine, and then without warning the cat bites you. You think ‚Äúwow cats are assholes,‚Äù but in reality, cats are extremely sensitive to touch and can be overstimulated very easily. That‚Äôs why they bite suddenly. We don‚Äôt understand that bc we don‚Äôt ‚Äúspeak cat.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs similar for people with BPD. We are much more hypersensitive than most people, which causes our mood swings to seem so extreme and unwarranted. It‚Äôs not an excuse to continue any bad behaviors, but it‚Äôs a good way to explain how something that‚Äôs not a big deal to someone without BPD can be very triggering to someone with BPD."

Everyone has their own experiences, and if someone was mistreated by someone with BPD then that is horrible, but it's difficult to find somewhere I can point my S/O to for support without fearing she's going to see a bunch of hateful things being said by people who are venting and have been hurt."

If you can, try to imagine your ideal self. What makes you happy? How much does your partner contribute to that happiness? Do their actions make you happy?

But all of the discomfort and pain that penetrative sex does cause me, combined with anxiety, guilt, and shame that have developed surrounding sex still make sex a very emotionally unpleasant experience for me. So while I want to try to find some sort of solution for myself, the typical ""cures"" people talk about don't really seem appealing to me. My issues with sex are caused by vaginismus, but I don't think the typical treatment for it would work for me.

My personal plan for myself is to go the psychological route and seek help in therapy. That could be something to help you get over some of your fears (if that's something youre interested in).

I find it's a little easier now because I'm home all day every day, so my journal is always close by. That way I can write something as soon as I feel it. 

Another problem I know I've had is I will write down some of my very intimate and emotional feelings when I'm super low, especially regarding my relationship. Then when I find that notebook/journal in the future, I tear the pages out because I don't want to see them. Either I don't want to put doubt about my relationship back into my head, or I feel ashamed of ever having thought that way in the first place. Kind of negates the purpose of a journal.

Maybe if you are just looking for a way to get your feelings out, you can record voice memos? That way you can verbally express your feelings and get it all out.

I think you need some time to make yourself a little stronger, and he definitely has some issues to work out. He doesn't seem to treat you with respect. I'm sorry you're stuck with him right now, but I hope that when this is over you are able to safely distance yourself from him."
BPD,fn2bcds,t3_fyx74q,1586583309.0,"I'm okay at Spanish but not fluent and I definitely don't have the vocabulary for this topic so I don't know exactly how great this is, but I found this:  [https://www.dbtselfhelp.com/](https://www.dbtselfhelp.com/)  The website looks kind of old but if you ctrl+f search Spanish it'll take you to a part of the website where you can download a zip file of DBT worksheets in Spanish."
BPD,fn2arly,t1_fn2aekn,1586582793.0,"I know that. I was just talking through my own irrational thoughts about my mental illness, and how I personally sometimes don't feel ""sick"" enough because I haven't hit absolute rock bottom. But everyone who commented gave me a lot of perspective and it's really helping to keep that thought away now."

BPD,fn0x8su,t1_fn0x34k,1586550526.0,That is....so horrible and I can‚Äôt imagine ever saying anything like that to anyone. I‚Äôm glad you said they‚Äôre an ex because wow fuck them.
BPD,fn0negb,t1_fn0l2g2,1586545150.0,"You absolutely hit the nail on the head. That particular therapist was not great at all, and told me on our 3rd session that I wasn't ready for therapy because I ""didn't know what to talk about."" But it was absolutely that defense mechanism that always comes up for me in therapy. And it's something I know about and try to work on. And I tell my therapists upfront about it, and good therapists help me to open up more. 

For me, I have a lot of self hatred and self loathing. Everything I do or say or think prompt a thought about how stupid or annoying or useless that was. And why would I want to talk to someone about the pointless and useless (and very damaging and hurtful) thoughts that I have? So it's hard to be upfront and truly honest about those things. 

I'm really just trying to find the right therapist who will hold me accountable and won't let me brush off my feelings, but also makes me feel comfortable and safe while doing that. Thank you for your advice!!"
BPD,fn05pvo,t1_fn00uhl,1586535910.0,"> Just because you're not having a mental breakdown in their office doesn't mean you aren't struggling immensely. 

Wow I felt that. Whenever I *am* having a breakdown at home I always think, why can't my therapist be here to see this?"
BPD,fmzwyn9,t1_fmzvqa2,1586531228.0,"> Have I ever tried to commit suicide? No. Have I ever made real plans of committing suicide? No. Am I in danger of committing suicide? Yes. **There is a difference, and I don't feel like people understand this.** 

I just really need to highlight what you said here because I think this is exactly what I was trying to get at with my post. This is so important."
BPD,fmzwci8,t1_fmzvqa2,1586530871.0,"First of all, I would so not do well with being able to read my therapists' notes on me. As badly as I want to, I know that would be such a bad idea for me.

And everything else you said......1000000x yes!! My mental state has been extremely bad lately and yesterday there was a period of a few hours where whenever I had an idle moment and wasn't actively thinking about something, the only thought running through my head was ""Kill yourself. You should kill yourself."" Again, I never really felt the urge to actually do it. It felt more like an annoying thought I had to block out. But I know that still can't be healthy and must be dangerous."
BPD,fmzw0uo,t1_fmzv4t7,1586530686.0,"That's a really good point, and I think subconsciously I kind of feel that way too. Especially the part about feeling like it's a symptom I \*should\* be showing. I think this is a really dangerous thought for anyone with any mental illness. ""Well, I'm pretty depressed, but I'm not suicidal, so I guess I'll deal with it on my own."" I think this stops a lot of people from reaching out for help, and it stops a lot of mental health professionals from recognizing the severity of our situations if we DO reach out for help."
Advice,fmtrwmu,t3_fxe6ux,1586377947.0,"find a new therapist. i had a therapist say this to me once and it broke me. i told my next therapist about this and she was appalled. please don‚Äôt let this discourage you. as long as you are willing to TRY to talk
about these topics, your therapist should be there to help you figure out HOW to talk about these things, and make you feel comfortable enough to do so."
BPD,fm9srs3,t1_fm9atfb,1585875748.0,Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful response. A lot of what you said is really insightful and I'm going to keep it in mind moving forward. Thank you so much <3
BPD,fm93s7l,t1_fm934dt,1585861170.0,"Thank you so much for your advice :) I've definitely had the no response problem when contacting therapists in the past. When narrowing down therapists on PT that take my insurance, offer online therapy, and specialize in BPD, the list was kind of small. If I'm not having any luck I guess I can unfilter online therapy and just reach out and ask if they're offering that now, given the circumstances. 

I have used the writing things down method in the past, and it does help! I'll definitely be doing that again this time."
