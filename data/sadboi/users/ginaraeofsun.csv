AskReddit,f20yhck,t1_f1ztiz0,1569865606.0,"I learned how in my GT  kindergarten class. I never had any use for it since I grew up in a small town of fast food burger joints, and steakhouses. But once I went off to college, I was surprised my hand instinctively remembered.  I have never struggled with them. Thank you, kindergarden GT, for making my friends think I was more worldly than them.  Haha"

depression,ezxrunc,t3_d2pnl8,1568248054.0,"I have/had this problem... I thought maybe hanging out with friends I would be forced to find my witty quirky sense of humor once again... but that didnt help.

Really what happened is I just went out, alone, I didnt interact with others, maybe just go to a book store then coffee shop once or twice a week. Then I started just going and sitting outside to do nothing, to drink coffee, to read. Then after doing this for about half a year, i was sitting in a local coffee shop, and I put down the book I was currently reading. And injustbsat there a few minutes... and there most magical, but incredibly subtle thing happened. I felt a hint of something. It was to faint to tell, maybe it was joy, or content, or just peace, who knows... but I could tell that all my effort had not been in vain because after half a month of pushing myself to do things that seemed meaningless... I felt something. So I decided then and there, that  I may not remember who I was or what I liked and disliked, but that doesn't matter. I'm going to figure out who I am now. And I just DID things. Things I used to enjoy, things I never enjoyed, things I always wanted to do, and things I did all the time. And now 6 years later I have maybe half a personality... I know my interest now solidly. As far as the personality, It has it's good and bad days. Some days I have lunch with people and I'm awkward and whitty, and charming. And other times im awkwardly quite and don't remember how to respond to anything. But I at least know now that I'm down there. Somewhere. And if i just keep doing then she will occasionally show herself to myself and or the world.

(As far as things I did to trigger that, they mostly required no one being present so I didnt feel the need to mask my depression. So I often would think, im going to dance alone in my room, I just to do that once. And the first 40+ times I felt stupid and silly, or singing in the shower or car. Or forcing myself to laugh OUT loud at something I think I may have found funny. I just did things till I stopped judging myself for a second, maybe took a few months at one activity before I let my guard down from myself before I could actually see if I liked something or not.)"
depression,ewt0wji,t3_cpvwhh,1565738111.0,"As someone who lived high functioning or 18 years, (and also looked happy as fuck) I eventually got sick of people not listening when i said I was gonna break so one day i just stopped. Stopped work, school, eating,  brushing my teeth. It was fiction awesome for like a month... it's been six years now and I can't hold a job,  I shower once sometimes twice a month, I haven't brushed my teeth in six years my teeth are REALLY loose, and I've forget how to socialize in real life because everyone treats me like i'm diseased or crazy. You can't go on living like that but I suggest you take a day off, or call in sick every once in awhile, because you have to let loose just don't give in.  Because it is A HELLA lot harder to put yourself back together that it is holding together."
