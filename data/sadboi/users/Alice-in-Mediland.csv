What's their effect? 
Again, thank you very much!"

That was pretty straightforward! I didn't know I could die as an avatar. hahaha! I liked the idea! 
If you are in a mood, at anytime, I'd like to know what the abilities are, and how we choose a class, but I think I'm ok with what I understood so far. 
Thanks again fellow habitican ;)"
Anki,f24rjgg,t1_ezbb0mf,1569958769.0,"Well, I tried a different way, I used ""deactivate anki algorithm"" add on, so I studied every single card on my deck. I then put a flag on the cards I wanted to study last minute, again. And then made a special deck with those cards. It actually worked well for me. I still prefer quizlet's software , regarding timelines and due-dates, but oh , well.  
Thank you all, fellows :D"

TooAfraidToAsk,ex8k7x2,t3_crqo7m,1566074303.0,"Hello, I am a med-student particularly interested in evolutionary issues, and I can tell you some answers from an evolutionary point of view. But english is not my naitive language so I will do my best. Hope it makes sense.!So, there are certain inhereted diseases that take place  only if you inherite two mutated  genes, both from mother and father. It is  called autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.  (in  contrast with autosomal dominance pattern where the inheritance of one single mutated gene , either by father or mother, is enough to cause the manifestation of disease after birth) . With that being said, it is obvious that if you reproduce with family members it is much more likely to inherite two defected genes and express a disease, as ihereted diseases often ""run"" in families. It is thus believed from an evolutionary point of view , that people have an instict against incest and impregnation of family members, due to the recissive inheritance phenomenon. However, there are scientists who stand against this belief and claim that it is not an instict that drives people away from incest but a social phenomenon, based on collective, unconsious knowledge of the increased possibility to produce sick children,  that has been built through years of evolution.  
There are also Freudian- and modern psychanalytic theories on this topic. You can google this, in this context. for instance.""freud theories on incest "" Hope that helps!"
