Edit: as much as I love these jokes, I'm gonna have to bring the whole thing to a screeching halt because I just looked it up and while answers are inconsistent, it is atrocious and I'm really hoping the mom didn't know what she was saying/teaching her daughter because if she did, it's pretty fucked up. 

Urban dictionary: 
>Also referred to asÂ stone femme, aÂ high femmeis a femme lesbian who doesn't want to penetrate her partner during sex or touch her partner's genitals. This doesn't necessarily mean she's adverse to pleasuring her partner in other ways, but she doesnt feel the desire or need to. Contrary to belief, high femme doesnt inherently mean extremely feminine, this is a myth spread by theÂ futch scaleÂ which was started by reddit lesbians as a joke. Additionally, high femmes arent selfish or lazy!! High femmes are valid

Some website called card carrying lesbian: 
>a femme lesbian who is ultra feminine in her appearance and behavior. May chose to only date butch women. Plays the passive role in the bedroom i.e., she is the one fucked, never the one doing the fucking.

Card carrying lesbian defined ""stone femme"" as something completely different right after that rather than calling it the exact same thing like urban dictionary, and it's wild, but we're talking about high femme here so I'd rather not make it the focus."
