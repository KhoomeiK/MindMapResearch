If you are diving head first into cptsd therapy or TFNLP then you best be on something to balance you out. 
Microdosing thc indica (Champlain oil) with Microdose of Valium has relaxed me enough to openly speak about my trauma with my therapist. This said - if you are on a regimen of antidepressants, my advice is to proactively engage in therapy to get help and leverage that the best you can while you get legal. 

But choose, literally CHOOSE for the right one where you can. This has made all the world of difference for me after 15 years and more of silence. 

I am legal from CDA Clinics via Telehealth. If you have a confirmed condition and you have gone longer on 3 months on a failed protocol, then request for schedule 4 CBD should be best for opioid reduction, for substance abuse disorder, for panic disorder, for treating trauma like a injury - rather than a completely f’ked disease. 

I hope to reach out to you via DM to help you make contact with the right people - if you wanted to try legal cannabis as part of your regiment,. 

You do not need a specialist approval to get TGA approval. This is in fact, another Australian Myth.

No first time user is ready for the duration of Champlain effects. But the neuroproctant properties are just brilliant. To be honest, first time I crossed a threshold on dose I, as an experienced self medicated cptsd veteran, sat there and thought in local expletives “whoa dude this this so so unreal and cool - how long is this gonna go for (at hour 4.5) is it possible to feel this relaxed an unreal, day to day, forever?

In this video when you make Instagram ACTIVE, the get / pull request and subsequent stream over lte/ip makes the iPhone emit bursts of EMF as part of network IMSI challenge. When your device pulls for up connectivity, the LTE side band antenna emit RFby way of function. 

In your shown example, the signal hits max amplitude momentarily (the flashing, as you turn off wifi) 

The signal amplitude is visible here due to the peak LTE IP ENQUIRY - FULL DUPLEX from the iPhone chassis, at that range. It oscillates the colours because of the dynamic frequency handling of the iPhone LTE signal amplification across the display bus phi. as well as having its own uniqueness in spec.
