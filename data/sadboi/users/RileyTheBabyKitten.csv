I heard my grandpa yell ""look where you're going!"" and less than a second later, the right (my left) side of my face slammed into a tree.

I went to a friend's house with my best friend, and the girl who lived in the house and I decided to climb onto the garage roof. We went behind the trailer, climbed up a ladder, and hopped onto the roof. There were numerous power lines above our heads, so we had to duck. Whenever we wanted to go down, we'd lower ourselves between the roof and the fence and hop down. On the third or fourth time, we heard her dad's car coming. In a panic, we went over to a tree by the garage door and climbed down. The girl went first, and she climbed to a little nook where two branches met and jumped down. I went next. I climbed to the nook, my foot securing me in place, and jumped. However, my foot got stuck, and I ended up falling four feet onto my back on the concrete. I remember seeing white as I fell, and I landed right below my neck. 
Holy fuck, it hurt. I was gasping, groaning, and I couldn't speak. I ended up with only a sore back, but if I had fallen at just a slightly different angle, I could've snapped my neck. I was literally inches from potential death."
