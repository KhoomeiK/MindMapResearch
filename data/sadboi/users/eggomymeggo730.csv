EatingDisorders,fqt6szc,t3_gksnhq,1589631732.0,"Oh look. Disordered eating plus a possible depressive episode. 

My friend, this is absolutely still disordered eating but your circumstances have changed. I recommend reaching out to a person you trust if therapy isn't an option right now. 

Drink some water, take a few deep breaths, and try to calm your mind for now. Meditation and yoga help me greatly when I have disordered thoughts.

ETA: being terrified of calories and not eating for extended periods of time is not ""faking it"". Please don't think that your issues aren't real. It's very possible it could be contributed to with job related stress, but the fact that you've swapped to binging now when a larger stressor has appeared makes me think that there are bigger things at play with your disordered eating. 

I'm not a doctor or a therapist"

harrypotter,fqdn2nn,t3_gi07vp,1589293003.0,OMG! So excited for you!
EatingDisorders,fqaso5p,t3_ghkpng,1589224599.0,"Holy Crap. Ok so that's hella messed up. I recommend getting advice from your therapist #1 and #2, please tell your mom that your weight and nutrition are none of her business. Each time she pushes, hang up, stop talking to her, and/or change the subject entirely."
EatingDisorders,fp9adco,t3_gc2i7i,1588420252.0,"Yo my dude, I feel this. I'm not a tattoo artist, im an engineer but I feel like I have to be thin, smart, on top of everything all the time, but also be cool so people will think I'm alright. It's exhausting and it never ends. 

I honestly recommend finding a confidant, whether it's a human in real life, a therapist, a dog, whatever works. You need to get this stuff off your chest. You're of course, always safe to post here as well. 

I hope you find some peace and happiness."
harrypotter,foc3myr,t3_g6qfzo,1587666732.0,"The thing is - Dumbledore must have known Harry was in the Library as ""Mad Eye"" did they could both detect people under invisibility cloaks.  Considering the fake Mad Eye was trying to off Harry, you'd have thought he'd make sure Potter got to the task to make it to the maze. Seems a bit idiotic that he wasn't actively searching for the kid."
harrypotter,foc2sql,t1_fobvof9,1587666466.0,"Well, Harry's desire changes in the chapter with Quirrel, he sees himself with the stone instead of with his parents.

 I think the mirror is entirely situational and it changes over time. The question on if his main desire changes? -  I think at some times the mirror for Harry will always show him being with his family, as he's always longed for them.  I'm sure it would have changed at some points when he was trying to find horcruxes or when he was wishing he was with Ginny, etc."
harrypotter,foc1pq2,t1_fobxtn9,1587666123.0,That's an interesting take on it. I've never thought of it that way before. I've been so focused on the lie instead of the outcome of said lie.
harrypotter,foc17t0,t3_g6rlyu,1587665977.0,Interesting! I've always gotten Ravenclaw on Pottermore but I try not to answer while thinking about the book series and think as If I'm taking some scientific poll.
harrypotter,foc0nb2,t3_g692do,1587665802.0,"That scene is one of my favorite introductions in the books, it's one of the most detailed and really gives insight into Voldemort's mentality about people."
harrypotter,fobvq0a,t3_g62rx5,1587664192.0,The series has always been a huge part of my life since it first came out. The release date for the books was always the day after my birthday so I could go to midnight release with my Godfather and get a super cool birthday gift. I still re-read the books and watch the movies and I have all the audio books. It's a huge part of my life and I use a lot of life lessons from the series.
politics,fmt6c6w,t3_fx8hga,1586367569.0,ya'll I really just wish in the future we could have a candidate that's not a billion years old.  Someone also with eyes on what's to come.
