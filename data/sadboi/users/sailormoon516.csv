AskMenAdvice,fnpc2qe,t3_g31h4v,1587142875.0,I’m a woman 32. I think you’re using COVID as en excuse to push her away and she is sensing that she is being pushed away and is pushing her way back in because she’s scared to lose you. I think you don’t really want to be with her at this point and you should be more up front and break up with her if this is the case. I think people do surprisingly better respecting one another when they have more of a sense of the truth. But when there is a nagging sense something is wrong people push until they get the truth. It seems like she’s being disrespectful but I think she’s just looking for an answer.

bipolar2,fk3w0kj,t3_erxtjz,1583847692.0,"A little late to the thread. I've been on 3mg a day vraylar for 3 weeks, so far so good. I am nervous about side effects and crossing my fingers (I had a body rash from lamictal). 

It did disrupt sleep at first, but I was sleeping like 15 hours a day, so a disrupted night of 5-6 hours is fine. I do go through insomnia during elevated periods, but haven't had one of those yet. Re: BP2 I tend much more on the depressive or mixed episode side rare if ever pure hypomania; vraylar is definitely elevating me at different times; I disassembled my bed frame out of the blue and gave it away, I found myself talking really fast at work, etc but  I'm thinking it needs more than a few more weeks to level out.

I was on zoloft alone which caused a manic episode (not too severe) and continued zoloft alone but it was increasing mixed episodes and I had a typical meltdown on it. My doctor prescribed vraylar because he felt it had not as many side effects as other mood stabilizers. 

Guess I am just hoping for minimal side effects (I did get the munchies a little bit) and for the mood to stay stable and hopefully at like a 6 (or 7:)) on the mood scale."

Similar story, in the beginning it's great, but then a few weeks/month in, they are frustrated with me/don't understand and they're ready to leave.

I actually saw a doctor today about how to manage this; she reminded me that the trauma is not my fault and not to blame myself. Practice being kind to yourself. I can assume that you have many positive character traits that led you two to enjoy each other's company. I always try to think about what my choices are and what my partner's choices are. I did not choose my past, and I don't choose to have flashbacks, but I can choose to seek professional help and not lean on my partners. My partners can choose to be compassionate and stay or can choose to leave. Men and women alike with all kinds of health issues (from obese, to addicted, to diseases, to mental illnesses) have supportive partners. 

You deserve a supportive partner. Don't worry about what he deserves."

Anny’s in it for life style and there is nothing wrong with that. There are many women AND MEN who prize material things. Considering the language barrier, Robert is just as materialistic as Anny since he wants to tote around this beautiful woman that he has no connection with. Anny comes across as low substance because she doesn’t speak English that well. I’m sure in her native environment she’s probably more charismatic. It’s much harder than it looks for the foreign person  (trust me I’ve been in a similar situation). 

Last, it’s dead obvious that Robert has LIED to her (5 kids) and WAY over promised which is why Anny is upset. He clearly insinuated he had a lot more than what he had and promised to buy her stuff and whatever. Anny just knows what she wants and so what if material things make her happy. 

All these guys trying to subdue these foreign women and half of them are deadbeats or dead disgusting. He wants her looking like a minion in the used clothes while he drives his uber. 

Robert has nothing to offer in terms of looks or emotional intelligence or love and they don’t have a good rapport. What’s left is money. 

He’s crazy if he thinks this is about anything else. And he’s not good looking by any stretch so he needs a serious reality check. I mean get with the program.

FemaleDatingStrategy,f5rx5ta,t3_dorke2,1572405160.0,"My thoughts on this are opposites attract and give em what they’re not expecting. 

I grew up very working class, criminal class tbh and dirt poor but I went to an Ivy League school and at one time was in the FBI hiring process for special agent (I failed security clearance oh well). 

I’m saying all this because many of us are very layered individuals and we can use those layers and interstices between masculinity and femininity to our advantage. 

You’re blue collar? Awesome. That’s sexy as hell. You wanna date white collar? Do you know your audience? Can you talk the talk? Play both sides of the coin. Show you can talk the talk but give em what they’ve never gotten before - a girl who can fix shit and can probably hang harder with the guys than he can. 

Think about what might be refreshing to the guy and without being fake, if you have that component own it. 

I think about the guys I’ve chased or been infatuated by and I ask myself why: I thought I couldn’t have them/their type but it’s a type I’ve always wanted. 

I grew up around super alpha males big gorilla types but I was too intellectual to ever fit in. I get infatuated by this because I could never have it. 

Now someone I’m dating, he’s kind of nerdy and I got a glimpse of girls he’s dated in the past, frumpy. So I give him glam, hoops and he’s constantly complimenting me. 

This is just my strategy"
ptsd,f5nktb0,t3_dodvm2,1572301273.0,"Not sure if this counts but I think the second different traumatic event caused a lot of mental health upheaval that I was previously managing much better. 

**1. Series of similar events (TLDR all abandonment)**
- sudden death of bio-father due to drugs
- intermittent absences of bio-mother due to drugs
- abandonment by bio-mother due to drugs
- sudden and unexpected death of adoptive father
- bio-sister ran away
- adoptive mother hardworking woman but emotionally distant, was emotionally and in other ways neglected
- sudden death of bio mother
- adoptive sister kicked the rest of us out of our house and sold it. Homeless for 3 months
- adoptive mother told me she needed to live on her own for financial reasons when I was a teenager and did so. 
- suicide by a guy I was dating (years later)

**2. One year abusive relationship**
- primarily emotional and psychological but threatened physical violence and didn’t respect some sexual boundaries. 

I’ve always had bad reactions (emotional flashbacks?) to perceptions of abandonment, since always, but it was manageable. 

Since the abusive relationship, I’ve had an escalation of what was a manageable bipolar situation. This relationship changed me. 

I’m also still jumpy and start to feel edgy when guys I’m dating get angry. The person I’m seeing now has noticed me flinch in his presence. I’m still a little paranoid and sometimes think guys I’m dating are coming over to kill me.

FemaleDatingStrategy,f5lk8xg,t3_do7coj,1572279626.0,"Agree with all of this - few extra points:

1. I’ve seen comments about slimming down in various threads. Getting in shape and toning up is technically slimming down but thickfit types are definitely hot. I think good advice here is get in shape AND wear clothes that complement your shape, whatever it is. I agree about being feminine but dresses for me don’t show me off the way I want to, they swallow me up. I slay in tight jeans, heals and a crop top. 

Also read some posts that obviously guys are into different body types of course but the girl not caring about her figure was a turn off, not so much the figure itself.  

2. I think having a healthy mind is important to mention to. Work on your insecurities, remove toxicity from your life etc. Not only will you be better off individually, your vibe will improve and so will your attractability. 

3. One more thing: remove the lens of looking for a relationship. This doesn’t mean lie about or hide what you want. Be clear when necessary that you want a relationship but remember not a relationship with anyone. Once I stopped thinking about getting a boyfriend and started thinking about who do I have fun with the most is when things have become easier, less stressful. 

I am single but actively dating two guys, one for four months and the other for one month, and neither have asked for a commitment yet. Maybe they will maybe they won’t but I only hang out if it’s on my terms and if I’m getting what I want which is literally only having fun getting to know each other. 

Always ask yourself: is this fun? Am I happy? Can I add value to his life? Can he add value to my life? And if the answers are yes to all- then ask yourself **what does it cost me?**

Sometimes we assign value because of what we get but forget what we pay for it. What are we putting up with to get it? What are we compromising to get it? I started seeing the other guy because I do like the first one but the cost is a little high."

I understand some of it was in the beginning of your relationship. Maybe “technically” you weren’t committed yet but still it’s dirty and somewhat deviant. I think people like this lack self control.

Stuff to think about
1. Don’t obsess! If you are not with that person try not to think about them
2. Don’t futurize! If it hasnt happened don’t think about it. 
3. Recognize that you may have a preoccupation with abandonment and you may be looking at dating through a lease of fear masked by excitement. If people leave you or don’t like you, you have to convince yourself this is okay. That abandonment by a guy you hardly know is okay."

One thing I am curious about is that I am from the NorthEast. A lot of working class families that I know experience something similar and when I meet people I can tell right away we’re going to be able to laugh off our fucked up families. 

I don’t find it too uncommon but when I started dating (in NYC) meeting people of all socioeconomic and geographic backgrounds, my story shocked people. 

Then I started realizing there is a common socioeconomic thread. Where I am from many of us are of recent immigrant extraction. As we know, the people immigrating from their home countries left in many cases to seek a better life.

I feel like sometimes guys get over confident like they feel like they won you over because you both enjoy the sex and then they start (sub-consciously) testing how much work you’ll put in to keep it going and let them sit back. At more insecure moments, I’ve definitely fallen into this and don’t want to find myself doing that. 

As far as intellectual interest he did tell me he was fascinated by me but I think that’s that male infatuation phase that happens in the beginning. We’re both well educated I have an interesting life story and other fun qualities but we’re definitely opposites. And guys don’t need to be into your intellect to be physically attracted/interested in sex in many cases.
