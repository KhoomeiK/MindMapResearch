bipolar2,fr1vmjs,t3_gm4v09,1589826697.0,"It started around nine with intense anxiety and not wanting to go to school. Ten is when I became a monster, screaming, breaking things, throwing knives at my sisters, etc. Got diagnosed with bipolar at ten."
socialskills,fr1ukn8,t3_gm4c5n,1589826200.0,"Yep! I had an amazing friend group like you five years ago. We cosplayed, went to conventions, played games, had nightly Skype calls. It was amazing.

Then my depression led me to believe everyone secretly hated me and that this friendship wasn’t good for my growth as a person, so you know I left by slowly distancing myself until they all left 

It has been a crazy hard time getting myself back. I will never be that person again, but there are parts of me now that I like. I am more mature and a bit more careful with who I associate with. 

It’s okay to remember who you were in the past, but it doesn’t mean that the version of you now doesn’t match up to it. It’s rare for people to stay the exact same for more than a couple years."

AskAstrologers,fqxmwiv,t3_glfsyl,1589734771.0,"I have a sixth house stellium with sun, mercury, mars, jupiter and pluto. Mercury mars and pluto are in Scorpio. I also have Saturn in Aquarius in my 10th house!

I definitely feel the pressures of the stellium. My life growing up was plagued with health issues, which kind of dictated who I would become. I actually had a near death experience at a young age because of an allergic reaction to a medication! Interestingly, now that I’m older my health is better than ever. I rarely get sick and haven’t had to see the doctor for anything physical in awhile. 

For the other part of the sixth house, the last five years of my life had me putting all my self-worth in to my job. If I wasn’t good at my job and my peers didn’t respect me, I felt as though I had no meaning as a person. Work became my life and because of that I dealt with a lot of issues with coworkers. I’ve since left that job, and at my current one I took the lessons I learned and have been a lot happier. I keep work at work, and leave it there. 

Routines are still something I struggle with, but I don’t believe it’s because I feel imprisoned by them. Rather I truly enjoy having a schedule and planning my life out. With my mental illness it is detrimental for me to have structure to feel on top of things. Sometimes I think i put too much pressure on myself to be productive, which has the opposite effect and makes me not want to do anything. 

I hope that was insightful a bit!"

Uhm for routine basically what has helped me is I talked to my manager about being the main closing shift, and since then I work about the same shifts/hours every day which has helped my mental health and work stress A LOT because I always know what I’m coming in to.  

Do you have consistency? Or do you have a manager who can help you achieve it? I find it’s hard to set a routine around work when you don’t even know what your gonna be working. It helps my bipolar too.

For getting baristas to listen, what I struggled with sounds similar to what you’re going through. The more I helped the baristas and watched over them, the more the knew that I would always clean up their messes. I had to start leaving them to their own devices, and it helped a lot.

Getting the baristas to listen can be tough, sometimes even if you want to be nice you have to put your food down. If you need to, pull those baristas that aren’t listening aside and say “hey I’ve noticed that every time I try to tell you to do something you don’t listen. I need you to respect that I’m your shift and I am trying to run the floor. If there is a certain position you would like time away from, let me know and I can try to move you.”

And if they still aren’t listening, bring it up to your manager.

But yeah! I hope this is helpful but feel free to pm me if you need anything else :)"
