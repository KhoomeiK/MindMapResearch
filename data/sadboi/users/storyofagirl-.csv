BPD,f27zyfu,t3_dcaoib,1570049662.0,"I have this thought all the time. But, Even if I did my bpd would make feel like I’m not loved and anything they did wouldn’t be enough"
BPD,f1wcjti,t1_f1jnf7l,1569783057.0,"First I just wanna start by saying you’re an amazing guy for not giving up on her. I have Bpd, sometimes if it’s really bad there’s nothing anyone can say too me it just has to fizzle out. Idk how she is but I need to just be able to walk away from the situation and be alone for a few minutes because I’ll realize how I am acting and I’ll snap out of it and come too. But sometimes it does help me if the person I am having a “miscommunication” as I like to call it cause usually it is my fault lol, to say that they hear me and they understand me and if they try to just listen and let me get it out, because not being heard or feeling like I’m not being listened to sets me over the edge as horrible as that sounds. Also understand that all of her worries are coming from a place of fear and she’s really just wanting to feel loved, in her mind it’s literally life threatening to be abandoned or not loved so we go into survival mode, it’s just how our brain is wired... so if you remember that it just needs to be treated back with love maybe that might help. imagine hearing the worst news of your life and the feeling that it brings. That’s what it is like dealing w Bpd with any slight inconvenience or sad event in ones life... But it sounds like you’re on the right track it seems like you’re her rock which I think is great just make sure you also have someone to lean on too this disorder can be a real mother fucker and can really test your faith. I think it’s one of those mental illness that effects everyone including the people around them."
BPD,f1wa3so,t3_d9fpyc,1569782221.0,I am literally going through this right now. I’m destroying this relationship and at the same time it’s like I’m sitting in the passenger seat unable to stop it. This guy I have been dating for two years deserves so much better but he still won’t leave me. He’s amazing and all I’m doing is ruining him. I hate having this disorder. I don’t understand why I have to be this way. I’m exhausted with life and building relationships with people and destroying them.
BorderlinePDisorder,f1w7iu8,t3_dagqf6,1569781269.0,This captured exactly how it feels. I find it hard to explain to people what it’s like to feel everything soooo strongly I feel everything so deep in my heart and soul it cripples me. I wish I could just show people this painting when they can’t understand my feelings.
