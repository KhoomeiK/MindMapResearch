It'll take you a healthy amount of time to get to where you're going though. Like, basically double the low end that most people see as a a ""good jump range,"" which is about where I am now (49.85ly). 

So what COULD happen is once you're running low on fuel, you may not have the ability to get to a fuel star to scoop if you ended up a little ways out from one. That can often just be an oversight in your plotting - look at what your map gives you and if you are hitting fuel stars along the way regularly. Just scoop every chance you get and it'll more than likely be okay - I have been doing 5-10ly jumps doing pure system exploration and I haven't went more than three stars without a fuel star. They're around! 

I think a lot of commentary around absolute jump range is often about getting to the further edges of the galaxy - there are systems people just can't get to, and if they can they can't get back from."
