If it's modern, say a high school setting, you could describe them as wearing a pronoun badge and a trans flag badge?

On other settings you could have a character see them that hasn't seen them in a while ask them about their sibling (because they used to have fun together or something) and have them respond and say they don't have a sibling, that was them (like the scene in barnyard, where Otis confirms that he is trans)"

I think of it in the same way I do when two underage people have sex. Yes, it's technically rape on both ends, but neither of them were in a position to consent as they were underage. You can't charge anyone for it, but it was illegal.

On another note, the laws surrounding r*pe are so fucked up in the UK. They haven't been changed since 2003. According to the UK law, it is only r*pe if there was penetration by a penis (in the mouth, anus or vagina). Objects and fingers don't count."
