AskReddit,f6u13gl,t3_dt31sh,1573156732.0,"Entirely depends on what sort of relationship you have. If you are in a committed and monogamous relationship, I believe that it's not okay to seek attention elsewhere. Sure, you can't help how you're feeling but is it because something is lacking in your relationship? 
If you're in an open relationship, go for your life. 
Maybe this is something that needs to be discussed with your partner or something you need to take a look at as to why you seek these things."

confession,f4x14j7,t3_dm42yg,1571861560.0,"Everyone grows up but you don't have to lose your inner child or fascination with things. I'm still fascinated by alot and have my moments where my inner child comes out, you just have to find what things allow you to do that or things that interest you. 
As far as the ""nothing bad"" goggles. Life is bad sometimes, it's down right trash at points and that's okay. Something you learn to accept but makes the really good moments so much better."
bipolar,f4bth32,t3_dk7gdz,1571518231.0,"I was like this. I would constantly compare myself to those on social media that portray ""the perfect life"". 
Then I started work with an Instagram influencer. Her entire page was about love and happiness blah blah blah. 
In person she was 1000000% the opposite. Rude, entitled, angry. Would often Chuck tantrums. 

Social media is not real. Most of what we see as ""perfect"" is photoshopped or exaggerated. No one is happy all of the time. 

You do you. Live a real life. Social media is deceiving and don't ever feel you must reach the impossible standards it sets. Life is not a competition my dear. You are excellent as you are."

As for her telling your parents, I'm unsure of how she will go about it. This all depends on how she judges the situation and the way she practices. 
Goodluck and I hope you can put this all to rest."
