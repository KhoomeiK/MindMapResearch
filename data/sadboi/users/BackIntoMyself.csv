depressionregimens,f2zd2cc,t3_detqye,1570515485.0,"I have taken many SSRIs, Cymbalta (a SNRI), benzos, remeron, and a few others. The SNRI was effective in diminishing my anxiety and depression symptoms, but also muted my joy, curiosity, love, emotional connectedness. I am a couple months off of Cymbalta now, and it‚Äôs extremely difficult to come off of. The withdrawal is horrendous. The benefits that I had on it were not at all worth the negative aspects of it. If I had to go back on a medication for my anxiety and/or depression I‚Äôd like return to Celexa or Lexapro. 

I‚Äôve recently been prescribed Lamictal and am researching before I choose to take it."
