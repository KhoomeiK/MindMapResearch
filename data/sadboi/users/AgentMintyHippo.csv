She came from wealth and my parents couldnt fathom how a person with her upbringing would be so unhappy as to end her own life. I had to break it down for them that they were making a lot of assumptions about this girl's life. And that having money doesn't mean that you are happy or that rich ppl have some ethical moral high ground (Quite the contrary if I may add) 

There were several times growing up when my mom would ask why my brother and mine's Catholic school classmates were bullies (shes doesn't know how ppl operate) or why my classmates from college were poor despite it being a middle tier private university. (Its called life, mom. Not everyone is privileged.)

I know that doesnt really answer your question, but I could imagine that the offspring of an Asian parent committing suicide would be shameful to the parents to endure bc it's a reflection on them (regardless of whether or not they were ""good or bad"" parents) and they would try to hide behind a wall of blaming the dead person when deep inside they know they are at fault to a certain degree (bc Lord forbid they have accountability)"
