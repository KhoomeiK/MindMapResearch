Advice,f9sgrxj,t1_f9sg3td,1575592130.0,id rather him send me to the office than have him look at me the way he was. i was not pushing the limits and i know that. no other teacher has ever said anything about the way i dress. that tells me something.
Advice,f9sfmm8,t1_f9ses6g,1575591491.0,"the thing is that no teacher has any problem with the way i dress or how other girls dress besides him. i get if it was inappropriate, but i did not dress inappropriately and neither did these other girls."

other male teachers have publicly said they wont comment on girls clothing, but if they think its too inappropriate then they will send them to the office so they can decide. it just seems like this teacher in particular has some issue with how we dress."
