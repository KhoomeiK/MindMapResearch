depression,fo677bm,t3_g5uy2n,1587549109.0,Congratulations buddy! Good for you! Stay healthy and safee
depression,fmz7jby,t1_fmybv9b,1586509492.0,I love this. Damn
depression,fmz7hjj,t3_fyb3q1,1586509436.0,This is ridiculous. I don't understand why people do that. It makes it worse for people who genuinely want to help too. Watch out for people like these. Report them or blatantly ignore.
depression,ev9smzf,t3_ciuo32,1564330233.0,Going to the gym and playing cricket! It may sound cliche but I take out my anger in the gym and cricket's always been my first love so. That's that
depression,ev3tmxq,t3_cicyqz,1564201767.0,I hope you end up in a safe and a peaceful place
depression,euzxwcw,t3_chzfr6,1564128425.0,Here to chat bud
depression,euukyy3,t3_chkmt3,1564046240.0,Here you bud and it's not just you. For me it feels like someone is always pushing me down. That someone doesn't let me get up from bed or doesn't let me do things. I am here with you bud. Here to talk if you want :)
depression,eupf8iv,t3_ch3ljs,1563956189.0,So happy for you man. Keep finding the small things that keep you going
depression,euchw1e,t3_cfptw5,1563675584.0,Now I play the waiting game. Just wait for things to go bad cause I know it will anyway. The good times lasts a second compared to the the normal (the bad ones)
depression,er96n33,t1_er965on,1560618215.0,"Good for you that you worked it out or at least got a solution that works for you!!! Really! It's great! 
I do have list of doctors and therapists that I talk to and take help from. It does take effort and I try to do it but nothing seems to ever work cause I either end up hurting them or get myself in a darker place and hurt myself a lot. But thanks. Means a lot and not just saying it cause it really does"
depression,er93tsm,t3_c0ufmp,1560616744.0,I don't know why but even when I knew all of this I just didn't want it to be true and real. Been fighting depression for 2 years now and I just don't know if anything will ever happen. I have suicidal tendencies and have also attempted. I also believed that it's never gonna get better (unless something drastic happens) but I always hoped it wasn't true somewhere in my head. This hit me pretty hard and I am a young bloke(19-m). I'll just hold on for a lil longer and see where life takes me before taking it
depression,epwu4e5,t3_bwc589,1559584726.0,Hey bud. Read the whole thing without the music so apologises! Also just out of curiosity what did you think would happen after dropping out? Anyway..here if you wanna talk about black ops cause I still play it to this day!!! It's old but gotta do something. But seriously. I don't do anything much all day so here if you wanna talk. Have ideas of how to end a life too so.
depression,ept0kst,t3_bvvqpg,1559476959.0,Huuggssss
depression,epsuct2,t1_epsu8ae,1559466970.0,I do the opposite. I write a lot when I feel down and out than usual and then I don't read them again. It's all there in my laptop but I don't read any of them. It's like a release for me.
depression,epsu0zm,t1_epstx7p,1559466407.0,It's certainly not stupid cause I like watching people smile and have fun in their own small world cause like you said. It gives hope. Even if it's a false hope
depression,epstt8z,t3_bvup45,1559466033.0,Yeahh. Sometimes it's just the smallest of incidents that happen in front of my eye that triggers my brain and makes me think if the past and then it's all shit from there.
depression,epstohv,t1_epstl7d,1559465808.0,"Thank you :) means a lot. 

I'll work on believing the second half but it must be true.."
