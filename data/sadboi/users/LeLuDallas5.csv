It's also bad for environment since it lasts for so short a time, washing synthetics makes ""microplastics"" that go in the ocean, etc. Some efforts for recycling recently for polyester and nylon though (H&M), but the real way to make it better is to stop making so much shit clothing!

I also have smaller hands so the combination of curved screen (functionally wider area I can't put nom active fingers on) and ever larger phones is uncomfortable. Big screens are great for a lot of things but I have a tablet with data so I'd prefer a smaller form factor, not tiny but just high quality in a smaller package.
