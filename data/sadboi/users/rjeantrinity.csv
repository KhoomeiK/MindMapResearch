Menopause,fq61eef,t3_gh1gli,1589122453.0,My husband and I have been together nearly all of our lives (Iâ€™m 52 and he just turned 54 and we have dated off and on since we were kids - 12 and 14 and committed to each other since I was 19). Our sex life was amazing and we learned so much together! We have loved each other practically forever but when peri hit it changed our dynamic big time and Iâ€™ve been in peri menopause a looong time. I donâ€™t really like discussing it either as I feel this loss of intimacy is not only out of my control but also my fault. Itâ€™s terrible to feel this way- and I often worry how it affects how he feels about me now. I know thatâ€™s crazy and heâ€™s a wonderful husband but I know him and how important sex has always been to him and it really breaks my heart to just feel ZERO desire for this man I love and respect so much. Itâ€™s a very confusing time for everyone. Iâ€™ve made an appointment to see my gyn to see if we can get some  help. I donâ€™t have much in the way of â€˜helpâ€™ aside from saying do t push her to discuss it too much. Tell her when sheâ€™s ready to have this convo you are all ears but let it be on her terms. If you push too hard her feelings of guilt may overwhelm her to the point of shutting down any time the conversation sparks. I wish you both the very best of luck and hope you find your way! Lots of women on this subreddit say itâ€™s possible to get to the other side of this with your relationship intact so Iâ€™m keeping hope alive here!

excatholic,fp1vlrl,t1_fosir57,1588249048.0,"This all sounds suspiciously like where I grew up just west of the city of Boston? Father B letâ€™s call him in my city - he shook things up big time and the parents hated him. He did â€˜specialâ€™ meetings for a hard core group of young men - junior high - who were all in trouble all the time. One of them was and is a very good friend of mine for many years. We both worked at the rectory during this time but honestly I never saw anything myself - Iâ€™m female and was 14-15 when working there.  As far as I know, he and one other young man are the only ones still alive (Iâ€™m 50 now and was 12-18 ish when the priest was there) - the rest of these 12 or 13 young men have died of overdose over the years, many of them before we turned 25. My friend has told me point blank this priest was a lover to him and several of the other young men and that much of their conversations were about Satan and sexuality. This priest really did a number on my friends psyche and I still canâ€™t fathom why he didnâ€™t get fired when the stuff hit the fan when the Boston Archdiocese blew up. He was moved to a smaller town - perhaps yours. 
As an aside, the elderly Monsignor of the church was also having sex with this friend and his older brother so there was obviously no place to run or anyone he thought he could tell.
Edit: Doing some quick research this priest was defrocked for sexual misconduct in 2002 (tho another source states  laicization happened in 2005 and Iâ€™m not sure of any nuanced differences) and was in several smaller Massachusetts towns after being in mine but before being fired. He also came to my church (1981) after being accused earlier at a youth counseling center, admitting it, and going to the House of Affirmation in Boston for treatment. This makes me so very angry, I hadnâ€™t thought of this in many years and makes me so sad for what my friend lost to this kind of corruption and sickness."

After that first bottle I think Robin, as a friend, should have given Howard the heads up and discretely sauntered over to  him or gotten his attention somehow when she sent the sommelier over for approval for the next 2 bottles, just to say â€˜hey this stuff is pricey, itâ€™s nice to try but do you want to pay this price all night?â€™ 
Iâ€™d expect my friend to tell me but he did give her carte blanche - so the blame goes to both of them."
