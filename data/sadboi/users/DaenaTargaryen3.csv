Many school schootings have been stopped before (Fun fact, including one at my best friends middle school. Her bf was telling her about bringing guns to school and shooting it up so she reported him and he was arrested). The justice system has to act as if the worst case situation will happen. So yes, if he was let off without any form of repercussion for bringing a weapon on campus, whether you'd like to believe it or not, there's a chance that someone could use it as a loophole. So they're doing what they have to to protect the students in the future. You have no way of telling how a potential sociopath, psychopath, or deranged individual would act in this situation, but taking away any and all loopholes seems smart. Mind you, I'm *not* referring to people bringing weapons on campus to hurt themselves, of course those people are in a different category than actual psychopaths or sociopaths who have planned a school shooting. They normally have a planned back up plan as well, and now they can't use ""I was only going to hurt myself"" as an excuse if they're caught.
