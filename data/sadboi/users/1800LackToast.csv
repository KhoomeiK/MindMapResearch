The police confirmed that Chandler’s description matched photographs collected during the investigation.

Jackson admitted sleeping in the same bed as Chandler 30 days in a row. He said nothing sexual happened. But, why would a middle schooler know what a 34 year old’s penis looked like? Why were children’s finger prints on those books and other pornographic materials?

Also, after reading up on this and seeing the Leaving Neverland documentary, it seems pretty damning that all of the children described almost identical sex acts."

Thankfully, that leads to me feel fairly good when I walk around and go through daily life. That said, feeling good should be enough. But, as soon as I think of my body’s appearance, I cringe. There have been times, all though they’ve been brief, where I’ve felt truly connected with my body and proud of it. I mostly feel disconnected from it.

Today, he said that it’s college students and left wingers who send those letters, begging them to not say certain words like “faggot” or to make jokes about certain people due to sensitivity concerns.

In the former scenario, it was fun and cool to reject the right wingers and religious nuts. In the latter, you can lose your livelihood for disagreeing with social justice warriors.
