sysadmin,fb64qxq,t1_fb642zr,1576541352.0,"A lot of folks here in VA bundle it under right to work, since the at will status includes striking as one of the things an employee is ""free to do"" under at will and an employer is ""free to fire them"" unless there's an employment contract in place (which considering newsrooms are slowly  getting into having unions and don't have negotiated contracts yet, there's unionized workers who can be fired without violating an employment contract under at will).

It's not talked about often outside of therapy or treatment,

Finals on top of everything can really stress you out, so let that get off your plate first. Then talk it out with your therapist, because the wanting to doesn't mean you need to be locked away. It's a starting point for getting better this time. And anyone who mocks you when you need them to listen or help you isn't anyone to waste your time on. They're a problem and not part of the answer, because you're definitely not alone in living with feeling like this."

4 years as an AS400 sysadmin, AD admin, troubleshooting the factory floor software, PC repair, and whatever else that was ""too technical"" for them to understand for less than half what any one of those jobs would have paid fried every last nerve I had.

Then I filed an HR complaint after she screamed at me for refusing and started making me worry about I'd be fired every day I showed up. Two days later she's running in there with an alleged harassment complaint against me, has me immediately suspended (with pay since everyone called me at home for help for the next two weeks), and then in her coup de grâce directs HR to not notify me of the hearing I was supposed to attend by phone to dispute it. Fired after that. 

An allegation that the accounting manager was trying to root around in user accounts and log into their emails would have been a shit show, but getting rid of the IS coordinator who pointed it out was way easier."

Billie is 17. Drake is 33. 16 year age gap. 

That 17 year old he groped and kissed on stage? 15 year age gap.

Secondly, since you're obviously a psychiatric professional you know that grooming someone especially when you have a position of influence over them doesn't really have shit to do with ""common sense"".
