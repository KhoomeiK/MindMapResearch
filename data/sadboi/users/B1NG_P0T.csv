You think...flies, contaminated meat, open containers everywhere, gross, gross, gross. My uncle started doing it; he and my aunt are upper middle class and you'd never look at them and think that a lot of their food was from the dumpster. He works for Habitat for Humanity and was talking to someone who did it, had the same reaction as me, looked into it, looked into it some more, and drove around to all the grocery stores in his area to check out their dumpsters. He was amazed at how much good food was thrown away, still in cans/jars, etc. One thing led to another and now about 60% of their food comes from dumpster diving. He's learned when certain grocery stores tend to get rid of their food and all the patterns. I was kinda horrified/interested when he told me, looked into it too, etc., and did it for a while. It took some trial and error to find the good places - CVS dumpsters are ***insane***; they throw away so much candy, deoderant, shampoo, etc., all unopened, and because their stuff is all in bags and not thrown in loosely, stuff isn't covered in gunk, etc. Pier One dumpsters were pretty good, too, and so were Staples dumpsters. Some dumpsters were just disgusting, but a lot were far, far less gross than I would have thought. Most places bag up all their trash so there's not just ick free floating around. 

I had ***absolutely no idea*** how much good stuff is thrown away - not just food, but rugs, makeup, etc., and all unopened/still sealed. If a customer returns something unopened, a lot of places will just throw it away."

My living room carpet smelled mildly moldy and was bothering my allergies but wasn't considered enough of an emergency to be replaced for a few weeks.

Got roughly 1/3 of it up, took a break for the night, and woke up the next day with COVID19. It was fucking brutal and I was basically bedridden for two months.

I live in the US; when you look at a graph of the suicide rate in the US over several decades, you can see a sharp decline starting in the early 1990s, when SSRIs became much more common.

Suicide is a different kind of loss than car accidents or cancer. When people die from cancer or a car accident, they didn't choose that death. There's no stigma attached to that death. When someone dies by suicide, they *chose* that death. And psychologically grasping that is **so incredibly hard and painful**. It cuts so, so deep. There are so many questions and you just want the answers you'll never have. I can see how blaming someone for the suicide of a loved one would make their death easier to understand. Plus, you feel so *guilty* at feeling angry at the person you've lost to suicide; channeling that anger towards a fiancee means that you don't have to feel that guilt. Again, what they're doing is not okay. At all. In no way. I don't agree with it **at all**, but I can understand it."

You just feel all these emotions, and the one that you feel the guiltiest about is all the anger you have that they took their own life.  Directing that anger at someone else would feel much more comfortable.

What they're doing is not okay. I'm sure his fiancee blames herself for what was ultimately a decision that he 100% made himself. She does not deserve to be treated the way that she has. Does. Not. But I do understand what they're doing. It doesn't make it okay, but I do understand it."

raisedbynarcissists,fp4mhj8,t1_fp2qqtk,1588302292.0,How your parents treated you had *nothing* to do with you and your worth as a person. It had everything to do with *them* and their narcissism. It's so fucking hard to not take it personally and not get bitter. But it helps me to realize that I could have been anyone and my parents would have acted the same.

There's a line in a Florence + the Machine song that goes 'I want you so badly but you could be anyone' that I relate to ***so, so, so*** much. I feel like I start a relationship with at least half of my feelings towards the guy present before I've even met him. Like, it seems like the feelings are because of *him*, but most of them aren't. In a weird way, most of the feelings are because of the fact that I'm in a relationship and not because of how I genuinely feel towards the guy. I fucking hate it and am trying very hard to break the pattern of going from *hi, nice to meet* y*ou* to *we're soulmates and should move in together* within two weeks."

I grew up with parents who never claimed their shadows - I don't want to perpetuate that cycle. Reading about people who have put in the miles and worked tremendously hard and at some point no longer meet criteria for BPD gives me so much hope. I really loved your post; thank you. I never want to maliciously hurt anyone. It's a struggle with some people sometimes. I really wanted to lash out at someone today but instead practiced urge surfing and now I get to go to bed proud of how I handled the situation instead of feeling like shit."

aww,foqs3g5,t1_fopto9h,1587999808.0,"Yay, Mr Odin! My dog Rufus had been at his rescue for 2 years - he was *incredibly* shy, which is my kind of dog. It makes my heart hurt to think of him there for so long; he's the sweetest, goofiest, most loyal dog ever. He always sleeps right by my side at night and some part of his body always has to be touching mine. When I'm working with my laptop on the sofa he jumps right up and curls up beside me with his paw on my leg. Always the paw on my leg - it's adorable. He's still very afraid of strangers but my other dog, Sophie, loves everyone she meets (she'd be an amazing therapy dog and I keep meaning to enroll her in a program so we can go to hospitals once this apocalypse is over) and she's helped him so much by showing him that people aren't scary. As long as they don't try to pet him, his body language is alert and cautious when we see people on our walks, but he no longer pancakes at the sight of strangers like he did before. Watching him come out of his shell in the apartment - his safe place - has been the biggest privilege ever. Biggest. Privilege. Ever. He's so wiggly and goofy - when he gets excited he gets so wiggly that his butt nearly touches his ear. Isn't it insane to think of all the people who walked by your Mr Odin and my Rufus? Little did they know they were walking past the animal equivalent of a million dollars."

UnresolvedMysteries,fobhxb6,t1_fo9ludn,1587659981.0,"Absolutely. There's something called [reactive abuse,](https://breakthesilencedv.org/reactive-abuse-what-it-is-and-why-abusers-rely-on-it/) which abusers rely on to make sure their victims - among others - believe that the victim is really the abuser, when in reality the victim is having a very logical reaction to being abused. Abusers are incredibly sneaky and manipulative.

On a personal note, I really appreciate your comment, u/Dribbleshish. This is a pretty sensitive topic for me and I always really appreciate people speaking up. I was raped on two different occasions a few months apart by men I was dating at the time. I didn't report them to the police and tried desperately to be in denial about what had happened. It was just easier, short term, to blame myself for what happened. If it was my fault, then I'd had some control in the situation, and that was a far easier world to live in (at least initially) than one in which two men could completely shatter my sense of safety and innocence permanently. 

That was twenty years ago, and the impact that those assaults have had on my life, even after years of therapy, is so far beyond anything I could have ever imagined at the time. I think that until it happens to you it's hard to understand the magnitude of the damage that being sexually assaulted can cause. It's been the thing in my life that's affected me the very most and has affected every aspect of my life; I am a different person because they chose to rape me. I've suffered 20 years of consequences (addiction, eating disorder, years of trying to flee the crime scene, which is impossible when the crime scene is your body). And I'm in one of the best case scenarios - my family and friends are supportive and ex-boyfriends have been supportive and understanding. I've been carrying around someone else's shame for years, while the men who raped me probably don't even remember their attacks.  I *know* that what happened wasn't my fault, but telling someone that I was assaulted is still so embarassing and feels so gross. It's such a hard thing to say.

Yes, obviously, whenever anyone is falsely accused of rape, it's awful. Lack of physical proof, however, *does not* mean that an assault didn't occur. If I'd have accused the two men who raped me of assault a few days after it happened, my case would have been dismissed as a false accusation because there was no physical evidence and there were no witnesses. I doubt that anyone who knew/knows my attackers would ever think that they'd be rapists and because I was dating them at the time, people could easily have said that I was just trying to damage their reputations. Because I was trying so desperately to ignore and deny what had happened, it would have been easy for someone to convince me that I was just remembering the situation wrong."
UnresolvedMysteries,fo90xdd,t1_fo8ek5s,1587608065.0,"Agree that making a false accusation is terrible, no doubt. But the % of false accusations are **no higher** for rape than for any other felony. Given the fact that the majority of sexual assault victims do not report the crimes committed against them, the **far, far bigger concern** is that victims don't feel comfortable coming forward because they think they'll be blamed, they were asking for it, no one will believe them, etc.

r/BlueStoneArt, I know that your comment isn't about how most survivors lie about being raped, etc., and my comment is a general one and isn't directed solely towards you."
BPD,fo3no2c,t1_fo31g4t,1587489935.0,"I got sober because my self hatred became too much to handle. I changed my eating habits because my binge eating was making me hate myself. I'm in therapy now (I'm quiet BPD) because I'm tired of living my life this way. Self hatred is such a miserable, miserable, visceral feeling, but for me it's always been the thing that motivates me to make big changes in my life. No one ever changes unless they've got a reason to do so. You are YOU, not your diagnosis. Having a diagnoses is helpful if it points you in a direction to go for healing. Be careful of using it as a cage, though."

Can't really even type this without cringing. It's absolutely insane to me that not everyone has this reaction to that sound.
BPD,fnircv7,t1_fniomzl,1586985011.0,"Completely understand - I'm feeling the same exact way about a former boyfriend of mine.  Just keep in mind that people can't see things that they're not emotionally able to see. When I've tried to force self realization into people who weren't ready it's never gone well and has only made them distance themselves from me. Not saying you'll be this heavy handed at all.

For what it's worth, I'm sober 18 years and didn't get sober until the pain of continuing drinking began to outweigh the pain of not drinking. If people in my life had kept trying to shield me from the consequences of my drinking, I never would have been motivated to get sober. Sometimes things have to fall apart - sometimes people have to feel the full logical consequences of their actions - before they can get better. Again, not at all saying that you're trying to enable him or are being too pushy. As someone who gravitates towards people, especially guys, with a lot of pain in their life because I feel such deep empathy for them and want to 'fix' them, this is just something I've struggled with."
