StonerProTips,fhwb8wr,t3_f529y6,1581911124.0,"Firstly if you’re already feeling scared about it that’s a bad sign I hope you don’t have a negative experience though. Try not being paranoid beforehand because that makes for bad experiences with drugs. I’ve been smoking for six years and edibles put me on my ass. I would suggest to go really slowly because you don’t know the dosage, even if it isn’t working after an hour wait before you take more.  I’m not going to try to scare you or talk you out of it but just to make sure you’re with a trusted friend and remember that even if you do get way too high, you’ll be fine and you’ll be sober eventually. Have some good music ready, or funny tv shows/ movies. Snacks are a must. 

I’m just saying from personal experience, edibles got me way too high and I freaked. I fell asleep and slept for like 15 hours and was perfectly fine tho. And if time seems like it’s moving really slow that’s normal lol

Make sure you update about your experience and good luck!!"

I woke up yesterday morning and I felt a strong urge to do this (I’ve only read about automatic writing once before). So I sat with my notebook and pen, closed my eyes and meditated. I ended up in a trancelike state and felt my hand moving. I asked if something was with me and that is when “yes” on the left page was written. I tried asking other questions like name and what they wanted to say but I can’t understand anything else that was written. Can someone help?"
