Austin,f5pfuyd,t3_dofbmg,1572358335.0,This is long overdue.    I hope it serves the community well.
BPDlovedones,f5pedrm,t3_dooz5w,1572357269.0,"I am really sorry that you are going through this.  I went through a similiar situation with my husband when we moved in together.  

I agree with what everyone has posted above.  The good news for you is that you have seen the warning signs fairly early.  There is hope that relationship can be stabilized.   You didn't mention in your post, but does your wife receive any therapy? Has she been diagnosed with anything? Is this something you could talk to her about? 

I wish you the best of luck with your situation."
BPDlovedones,f5obeax,t1_f5o0poo,1572314095.0,"I am really sorry that you are going through with what you are with your husband.  Especially because there are children involved.   I am not trying to give you false hope.  But if there is any, he needs to get into DBT ASAP.  That's what saved my marriage.  PM if you want any help or resources.   I wish you and your daughter the best of luck."
BPDlovedones,f4w68gv,t3_dlj2yj,1571852277.0,"I am sorry that you are going through this.  This sounds awful.  Unless she is willing to stop this destructive behavior and get help, nothing will change.  

I recommend you follow through with your exit plan now if you can.  You can always wait and see from a distance if this just jars her into getting serious help.  That's what I did.  I wish you the best of luck."
BPDlovedones,f4vswtu,t1_f4vmqbi,1571847330.0,It will not just happen on it's own.  Is your wife willing to make some positive changes? Maybe consider therapy or possibly DBT? DBT saved my marriage.
BPDlovedones,f4sawfs,t3_dlj2yj,1571776067.0,"I never caught him red handed. But I think there were a couple of different inappropriate flirting possibly more situations.  It was murky. 

It took time to move passed things. Part of it was me being willing to start over with him.  But I knew I loved him and I saw a real desire to change in him.  He made good on that too.  I do not regret staying and I am thankful we got another chance."
BPDlovedones,f4rv566,t1_f4rngj5,1571771876.0,"The first two years of our marriage,  there was bad emotional regulation on his part, possible cheating and and some physical abuse.  My husband was a big drinker, but was also very high functioning.  

I left him and filed for divorce.  He spent a few months working on himself and began DBT.  He also curtailed his drinking.  

He isn't perfect but he's a good husband and good dad.  Things are not perfect but his emotional regulation is much better.  There also has been no further abuse or cheating."
BPDlovedones,f4rgysr,t3_dlj2yj,1571767373.0,"I have been married to a man with BPD for 8 years and we have 2 kids.  We had a very rocky start, but he embraced DBT and that has made all the difference.  So there is hope.

The pwBDP has to want to change though.  Our marriage isn't perfect.  None are.  But I am proud of it and my husband and I think we provide a good environment to raise kids in."
BPDlovedones,f4n2zjn,t1_f4ivkb8,1571685155.0,"
I have been married to a man with BPD for 8 years, and I can tell you the DBT was a life changer for him.  That and curtailing his drinking.  I felt like I began to see real changes in him after a couple of months of DBT.  BUT.... This a big BUT he had to be ready and committed to it and he had to want to do it for himself and not for me or our relationship.  

About 6 years ago, we too were on the very brink of splitting up.  I had moved out and filed.  What made me start to see a willingness to change from him was that he respected the boundaries that I laid down when I left (no constant phone calls or emails), he did not fight me on filing for divorce and began too take responsibility for things he had done. Those are very unBPD characteristics.  It was that behavior that convinced me to have one more conversation with him about where his life was going before things were finalized. I guess for some seeing the end of the world is what they need.  

I do not know if your husband is full of baloney or not here. Only he knows.  The one positive I can see in his message (other than he is going to DBT) is that he did not ask you for anything or expect anything.  That too me is a good sign. It shows at least some respect 

I do not know what your husband has been like during the seperation.  Maybe he has continued his bad behavior towards you. No one can tell you what is right for you or if he can really make a big change in DBT.   Those are things you need to decide for yourself. I am sorry that you are in this spot and I wish you luck."
relationship_advice,f4mtf4c,t3_dkz2dw,1571682246.0,"I am sorry you are going through this.  This sounds very suspicious.  Have you had indication that he was cheating before?

I would make one more attempt at a discussion where he must explain his actions to you.  If he cannot, or it seems like he is lying or gaslighting then you should consider getting out of this relationship."
relationship_advice,f4moz33,t3_dl0f1g,1571680897.0,"I am very sorry that you are going through this.   I too am married to an older man, and sometimes this type of thing can be intimidating.  

I would recommend you 100 percent talk to him about this.  Also there are counselors that can help with this type of situation.  This is nothing to be ashamed of.  

Do you think your husband would be receptive to talking about this or possibly seeing a counselor?"
Austin,f4mntn8,t3_dkqwba,1571680569.0,Absolutely.  Vote early and vote BLUE!!!!
BPD,f4m3cvv,t3_dktvds,1571674065.0,"I am sorry that you are going through this.  Give yourself a break and do not beat yourself up too much here. 

I think it is great that you at least have enough introspection to wonder how you can better in relationships.  A lot of folks do not even have that.  If you are struggling in relationships, you may wish to consider seeing a counselor to help you work through these issues.  It may help.

I have been married to man with BPD for 8 years.  So I definitely understand."
relationship_advice,f4lws0w,t3_dkthmr,1571672091.0,"I am sorry to hear that you are going through this.  I have been married to a man with Borderline Personality Disorder for the 8 years.  In the early days, before he got treatment and stopped drinking, we also used to have bad incidents.  Thankfully that is behind us now.  So there is hope.  

I will suggest that you need to set much stiffer boundaries for your wife's behavior and was as expectations for her behavior and treatment of her issues.  

If she is unwilling to own up to her bad behavior and get appropriate treatment, then you need to consider leaving for the good of you and your child.  I wish you luck in dealing with this."
relationship_advice,f4lungm,t3_dkzg8c,1571671439.0,Wow this is not ok and shouldn't put up with it.  Taking money is extremely disrespectful and selfish.  That isn't even getting into his prior issues with drugs.  You really need to set tougher boundaries with him and consider ending the relationship if he keeps violating them.  Just my opinion.  I wish you luck.
BPDlovedones,f4ldwxt,t3_dkxml8,1571665849.0,I am sorry that you went through.  Try and focus on yourself.  Talking with a counselor could definitely help.  I wish you the best of luck.
