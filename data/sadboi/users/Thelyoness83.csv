JustNoSO,fq6hyub,t1_fq6fkvg,1589131881.0,"Yeah, effort would go a long way. I guess I could try one more time. I just didn’t have the energy to put it into this conversation-again. It’s just frustrating and such a turn off to have to tell someone these things. It’s like another child. I totally get he’s not a mind reader, but fuck, I thought he’d know me well enough by now. Especially and most certainly bc I have point blank told him these things. Then tried to lead by example by doing it for him. 



It is a culture thing and it doesn’t help that he had/has a shitty family and he’s never had an example’. Part of my frustration was figuring out that he just literally did not know what to do bc no one has ever shown or told him. But the fact that I have told him, and shown him, repeatedly, and he still doesn’t do anything...doesn’t even SAY anything, is making me angry and sad. 




The thing about my kids though-I want them to have the example that I had with my family life, and that’s probably why I continue to do my best at Father’s Day, birthday, etc. I do it as much for them as him sometimes."
JustNoSO,fq6h933,t1_fq6ep4j,1589131487.0,"Yeah, I don’t post here a lot bc of comments like this. I also didn’t give much of a history either, so that’s my fault. This instance isn’t immediately leading me to divorce him. You’re right though-this is who he is apparently. For some reason, he always does right by my birthday. I don’t see why he can’t show the same care and consideration on Mother’s Day. 



He HAS shown me this through the years and you’re right, why do I accept this. I guess bc these aren’t deal breakers to me. Am I mad, am I hurt, am I upset, am I tired of doing this every year on Mother’s Day-yes. Have I addressed it multiple times-omg yes. At some point I did realize that these are some of his flaws, and had to analyze are the cons outweighing the pros? There are still  so many other things to consider, before I’d go to divorce. Some of things I consider about him is that he didn’t have a dad or father figure, and his mom was a drug addict who was never home, and I’ve come to learn that so many things I expected him to know or do.....he didn’t have the great family home I had so he simply just doesn’t know to do these things. He never had an example.     The part that pisses me off is that I HAVE explained these things to him; I’ve tried to lead by example by doing it for him; I feel like I’ve spelled it out and point blank told/asked him what to do/what I’d like, and he doesn’t reciprocate. THATs the part that’s making me upset. 



But in this forum, on this day, I needed to rant to someone, so here I am to get this off my chest."
JustNoSO,fq6efbz,t1_fq6cu4g,1589129925.0,"Well, it’s nothing over the top, but I at least try to do something for him. For one, I usually purchase a gift for him well in advance and it’s one that I’ve put consideration into. I have the kids make him cards. He sleeps in every weekend regardless of the occasion, so he of course gets to sleep in. Then I try to not ask him for anything all day except what he wants to eat. Then I cook for him (this is also nothing ‘special’; I do all or most of the cooking anyway) then we usually either go out to eat with my parents or order out dinner. And definitely sex is involved at some point during the day/night. 




So the things I do for him.....are the things I wish he’d do for me. I feel like we’ve had this conversation soooo many times that I just can’t anymore. I realize that what I do for him on Father’s Day isn’t spectacular, but I’m not asking for amazing. I’d like just some nice thought into it. Something to show he cares about someone other than himself."
ARFID,foqpl0u,t3_g8wqip,1587998475.0,"This is a good question bc I have done this before. I used to juice and just hold my nose and chug the drink down. Absolutely disgusting but it was one of the only ways I could think of to get fruits and veggies in. At that time, I had read that I would lose some of the benefits of eating, like the fiber from skins, but it wasn’t an unsafe option.      
I also do smoothies sometimes but those take longer to drink, and I never end up finishing them. I also feel like I waste the fruits/veggies that way bc I don’t drink smoothies every day and the produce is ruined. They’re expensive.      
So you’re method to me sounds reasonable and like something I’d try. Although I agree about the possibility of choking. 
I think bananas make sense in this case bc the small pieces would probably be soft and mushy so it’d presumably go down easier?"
AmItheAsshole,folo5nn,t3_g805ko,1587866548.0,"I’m going Nah but only bc shit like that doesn’t mean anything to me. So I really, really think this is dependent of the type of person. I would not care what kind of ring my soon to be husband got me. Also, I don’t wear my engagement ring; I didn’t know people did that?!? I think it would be weird wearing two rings. Maybe I’m super naive or too poor or what, but I didn’t know it was a thing. None of my friends do that so I’m just out of the loop of the rest of the world I guess. Lastly, I just don’t have expensive taste I guess and that’s why I think this really should have been a situation in which you know your partner and know what they expect and want. I personally would not have minded what you said or how much you paid, but apparently your partner did, and that’s where I think the problem is. That you didn’t communicate enough to know this before making such a big decision."

Teachers,fo75o32,t1_fo6hogt,1587572684.0,Me either. I had to unfollow most in Facebook bc I can’t even stand their posts. Or some parents whose kids are crying tears bc they miss school so much. There was a collective cheer from my whole family when school got canceled for the year. My oldest doesn’t ever want to go back. He’s asking to be homeschooled now.

SuicideBereavement,fo1d684,t3_g4smgh,1587430729.0,"I read the note every few months. I pull it out and read it. Sometimes I cry, sometimes not. I’m not sure why I do it. If it’s a way to feel close to her, to the last thing she write? To try to continue to analyze her frame of mind? Even though it’s short, very short, and she basically tries to absolve me of any guilt by repeating ‘it’s not your fault’ and ‘I love you’, among other things she wrote....so maybe I like to read it to hear or see I love you one more time. But I feel extremely guilty, even though it isn’t my fault necessarily but as her older sister I feel like I should have prevented this somehow. Anyway, yes I read the note. But I can’t listen to the last songs we listened to together. Actually, I can’t listen to a lot of music that we used to. Even if the songs are from a happy memory, and most are, but it just still makes me so sad."

Teachers,fntj10y,t3_g3qatr,1587242637.0,"I just went through this. I interviewed at what I thought was my dream job/school. At the middle school in my town. The one I can see from my house, so I could walk there. I didn’t get the job and I was actually relieved. As the interview process went in, I realized I really didn’t want to work there. I just like the IDEA of working there. How convenient; I could walk! My kids go there! But then I started to recognize that I would always be ‘on’. I could never again go anywhere in my town without being recognized and possibly having to speak to parents or students. I live in a more affluent part of my county, and I don’t say that to brag-I mention it bc I realized I’d be held to a higher standard. I’d be judged. Scrutinized. And if I had my friend’s kids, or my kids’ friends, or my neighbors...how awkward. And I decided I’d hate that and would rather commute and remain anonymous."
Teachers,fnti6m2,t3_g3rhve,1587242149.0,"Just don’t make my mistake. I tried to dress like someone I wasn’t, and ended up wasting money on clothes I wasn’t comfortable in. I tried looking like a ‘professional’ and what my idea of a teacher is/was, and I just was so uncomfortable. I now wear the same thing basically every day. Jeans or skinny colored pants, a plain tee or tank, and a cardigan. Sketchers BOBS are my favorite shoes and I have multiple colors and styles. My mornings used to be stressful too, bc I’d just try on all kinds of things and waste time. Even picking out outfits the night before....in the morning I wouldn’t feel like wearing that anymore. In a nutshell, I was trying too hard to meet this weird expectation I put on myself. Literally no one else at my school cared what I wore. I am so much more comfortable and mornings are a breeze."
Teachers,fnmmvj8,t1_fnmkc5v,1587074307.0,They are a part of our Facebook group and have been responding so I know they’re well aware most teachers and parents aren’t wanting to send their kids back. They also sent out a survey and 80% of respondents want to continue online learning and not go back.
Teachers,fnmmdch,t1_fnmkslx,1587074048.0,And maybe this varies state to state and depends on your union leadership. I don’t know that there are opportunities to be involved? Should they advertise that? I guess I’m asking what other states do to get members involved.
Teachers,fnmlzqy,t1_fnmkslx,1587073852.0,"What should I do to be involved? What does being  involved entail? Not being snarky, legitimately wondering. I just don’t even know what I would do with the union besides call and send them emails. Which I have done. And they have responded. I’ve reached out more to state reps and had success doing that. Like, the actual person replied back to me and had an ongoing issue with state insurance. And they actually solved it for me! That felt like a win."

I teach in special ed high school and my kids are just as bad with basic hygiene and personal space as elementary age, so I wouldn’t feel comfortable going to work. The only reason I mention the FMLA is bc I have an approved leave, and most people don’t/wouldn’t. So I feel in this situation I can make this call to stay easier than someone else bc my job would be protected. And I would in fact, be ‘forfeiting pay’ bc I wouldn’t get paid on this leave. I have no sick days left, hence the FMLA."
Teachers,fnlh8ns,t1_fnlexwi,1587053512.0,"I figured I would be, and he would be covered by his dr’s, but my other kids won’t be. Surely they won’t start a truancy process over it. I also can’t imagine I’m the only parent who would not be sending their kids. So they would be chasing a lot of truant students/parents who normally would not be truant. I’m fact, if enough kids stay home, they may not be able to keep school open anyway. I just can’t understand why this is one of the risks they are willing to take. I wish they’d just be affirmative and make a smart choice."

So I’m not sure if the having children part is the cause or the getting close to 40 part. Probably a combo of both. But I have not changed my safe foods for most of my life so that’s why I think it’s the change in my hormones and body from kids and age. In fact, if anything, I have actually dropped a lot of my safe foods that were complete shit, like pop or bread or desserts or candy or chips or junk like that. I definitely eat a healthier diet (well, the healthiest of my safe foods, which is a lot of meat and potatoes)."
Ozark,fn36uqa,t1_fmzx4ew,1586614286.0,In episode 1 they mention that 6 months had gone by. I forget the exact words but it’s in there.

Ozark,fn0x1jp,t3_fygg89,1586550415.0,The only thing I felt explained this was they mentioned the timeline of 6 months...so I assumed the end of 2nd and where 3 started...6 months had gone by. So I just assumed in those 6 months they had the office rebuilt.
StackAdvice,fmv2icj,t1_fmuz3n7,1586404456.0,"Yes, I think it has a name. I’d have to check back through my posts, but I think it was serotonin syndrome or something like that. What happened was I developed a super cocky attitude and inflated confidence. I acted like I was invincible and I did not consider the consequences. These traits are very unlike me and not my usual behavior. During this time I said and did things at work that were so completely out of character for me, and that was the ONLY reason I wasn’t in more trouble. Bc my boss of 10 years  knew this wasn’t like me to say things like I did and to behave that way. Hmm, what else...I also got into it with my kids’ principal, which again was a completely unprofessional and odd thing for me to do. I never in a million years would have said things like that to her face. It was basically like I had no filter. I was kind of manic and acting on impulse. These things were concerning enough for me to stop using it. It took me a while to put the pieces together but I am positive it was from daily use of 5HTP. It took months for these symptoms to show up though. From my research and help from this or maybe another sub, I don’t remember, but anyway they helped me narrow things down. I went back to my normal, level headed persona pretty quickly after I stopped so that was another indication that the 5HTP was the cause."

POTS,fmtqxqb,t3_fxavq9,1586377465.0,"Right now, I guess I should clarify, I’m most concerned in that the symptoms have lingered with the eyes and head rush. When I get up I feel like I have a ‘brain freeze’, like when you eat ice cream or something cold. It goes away pretty quick. But my eyes cannot focus and are blurry, and that’s weird it’s still happening today. It’s hard to type this and read posts or read anything really. It’s also hard to watch TV. And really I posted here to know if these lingering effects have ever happened to anyone, whether it’s from a migraine or not. Maybe the oh episode triggered a migraine or something? Idk"
POTS,fmtqimb,t1_fmtojh2,1586377256.0,Yes I’m waiting for him to call to do a video visit. I’m just weirded out and confused by the cloudy like vision. It just cannot focus and trying to type this and read is really hard. It’s like blurry and I’m trying to force my eyes to focus. -I totally have had headaches like you said though with the eye thing.  Where I’ve also found relief by pressing my eyes in.

POTS,fmtpz65,t1_fmtllhi,1586376992.0,"I’m more concerned about the weird fuzziness in my eyes. I don’t have pain anymore, just the blurred vision. I thought it would be better after I slept it off, but it’s lingering."
POTS,fmtlr4q,t1_fmthh97,1586374907.0,"Well it’s not that I’m unwilling to go, it’s the my dr’s office is not doing any in person visits at all. None are open besides the hospital. I called and still waiting for my doc to call back. He is doing tele visits so I’d be fine doing that. It’s just without physically examining me then it’s going to be hard for him to determine anything. And I doubt he’d send me for labs/tests bc the hospital isn’t doing any unless they’re like life or death situations. So you’re right, I’ll just have to mange. But it was helpful to know if anyone had also experienced this and had any knowledge from their experience."
POTS,fmtdgn3,t1_fmt9eyn,1586370876.0,"Thanks for the response. So did your symptoms last days like this? I am no stranger to this happening, but it only lasts seconds to a minute, tops. I’ve never had these symptoms linger and last until the next day. I did have another ‘episode’ when I got up from the couch a few minutes ago, but the blackness, head cloud, blood rushing thing lasted the normal amount-a few seconds then went away. I’m just concerned and impatient. I want my dr to call now and give me some kind of answers or plan or something. But like you said, I’m not wanting to go to the office or hospital and I doubt they’d even do labs or tests right now anyway bc it’s not an emergency. At least I don’t think it is. Or I hope it’s not. But last night I was convinced I was dying from a blood clot or aneurysm or tumor. And there is no way to know that I don’t have those unless tests are run."

All I know is the reaction I have, the anxiety, the gagging, the immediate need to spit out whatever the unsafe food is, that flight or fight type of panic....all I know is I will do anything to avoid that feeling and therefore stick to my safe foods. I am not sure what’s happened in my young life that started this. I only know that I’ve been like this for as long as I can remember so my whole life basically. Nothing sticks out that was traumatic but clearly something happened for me to have this anxiety and reaction. I too tried a hypnotist before but it did not seem to work on me. I could only go a few times though bc I couldn’t afford it at the time. 
I am now seeing a psychiatrist for a totally separate reason, but I’m hoping as I deal with my PTSD (again completely separate experience and situation) and anxiety that I can get to a place where we can also address the ARFID. I recognize that it is some sort of anxiety, hence the fight or flight panic and completely irrational reaction.

How do I disconnect my console account from my Epic Games account?
Please be aware that disconnecting your console/platform account from your Epic Games account is highly discouraged for the following reasons:
Your game progression and purchases are stored on your Epic account. So, if you disconnect your console/platform from your Epic account, you lose access to that data.
If you sign in to your Epic Games account using a console/platform that was disconnected, you will automatically create a brand new Epic account. This new account will not have any game progression.

If it’s not done, they’re getting a zero. What normally happens (during the ‘normal’ school year) is they or their parents check their grades, freak out, then email or ask why is the grade so low? I fully anticipate this to happen, at which point I will resend or send screenshots of my previous messages and posts. I think at this point, kids are not taking this seriously and this will take a while to sink in that this is how school will be now. I already made a million phone calls and spoke to their parents who assured me they have internet access. All but one of my students has internet access, so they don’t have many excuses."

TooAfraidToAsk,fkrwxvj,t3_fk5ejb,1584477681.0,"Idk but I also wondered this. I’m pretty transparent and I openly talk about money or financial troubles. Why I really want to talk about money/finances because I wonder how in the hell people I know live the way they do. Like, I know how much they make a lot of times or close to it. And I see all the shit they buy, the house, the vacations, and I just wonder what the fuck I’m doing wrong. For example, I’m a teacher and as a public employee, our annual contract amounts are listed online, for anyone and everyone to see. So, I know how much my co workers make. And cannot understand how they afford what they have. My personal opinion, they are in debt to their motherfuckin eyeballs. But they don’t admit that or talk about any of that. THATS the part that’s taboo for them. How much debt they carry."
SuicideBereavement,fkolu1p,t3_fjm50t,1584389782.0,"I’m so very sorry. My sister and I also had a relationship like yours. We were so close and the best of friends. It took me a very long time to process the finality of it. I was the one who found her, and oddly I hear my own screams when I think back on that day. It was like an out of body experience, like someone else was screaming. But no, those are mine. The feelings of grief cannot be explained well bc the pain is so great; there’s just no words that adequately describe the feelings."
SuicideBereavement,fkjbrjo,t3_fis8yp,1584241469.0,"I do very much relate to this. My sister died almost 8 years. Every few months I read the note and go through all her stuff, looking for some new clue I somehow missed before. I also look at pictures of the ‘scene’. Why I did this....I’m not sure. After the EMTs took her body, I took photos of the room and all the gore. It somehow brings me both comfort and sadness and bewilderment to see how her room looked. EXACTLY how it looked the day she died. Even the spots of blood are a clue to me. I zoom in on the pics to again try to find clues.  What I really, really want to do is go to the police station and get her file. I want to read their notes and their ‘version’. My sister did a few weird things before she died, and I have my version of how things happened, but I’d like to know theirs. After she first died, I was obsessed. I looked at all the evidence I had and was consumed with piecing everything. I even made timelines and different scenarios. I recognized how this was not helpful and it came to a point where I knew I would never find those answers. But still..I feel the need to comb through it all again from time to time. Bc probably of what you said. She doesn’t feel real and like she was all some dream or something. Like that entire part of my life wasn’t real."

Just played our own music at the reception so no DJ. Since no alcohol was allowed at the church, and a lot of old fudgety relatives were there who would be no fun anyway, we had an after party for just the fun relatives/friends at my mother in laws. Most people brought their own booze to that. It was just a low key wedding bc we wanted a house instead of spending all our money on a one time event"

I really feel for your son who found him. I was 30 when I found my sister; I can’t imagine trying to deal with what I saw as a teen. Your post haunts me bc as a parent now myself (with PTSD) I wonder if I can do everything right and one of my own kids will still die this way. It’s scary. But for myself, after my sister, I definitely sought therapy and actually found a support group much better than the therapist. I didn’t feel like the therapist really understood what I was going through; and how could she is she hasn’t? This type of grief feels different than other types. There’s survivors guilt that feels different when it’s a suicide. I really believe I could have prevented my sister from doing what she did. I’m stubborn in that. But what I got from the support group, which was specifically a suicide survivors group, was that they all felt the same type of grief as me. The emotions that I had.....they understood what I was going through. I just found it really helpful."

CerebralPalsy,fj41vm6,t1_fj3yx4v,1582998375.0,"But no one pushed this. It was all me so I’ll accept that responsibility. I am a special education teacher so it’s not a wheelchair itself scared me. It was bc I believed he’d need a wheelchair bc he was in so much pain from spasticity. And from the damage that spasticity caused. He used to cry at night bc his legs were hurting so bad. I’m coming from the parent perspective, and so it was really hard watching it and feeling helpless. So when an opportunity presented itself that claimed to take away the spasticity....I took it. I still feel like I’m an educated person who did her research but also have no medical background and limited medical knowledge. I also only have experience with people with CP who are severe and have a ton of other diagnosis in addition to the CP. so I really didn’t have an examples or experiences with people who have mild CP. I searched the internet for first hand accounts and experiences. That’s why I’m on this sub. I wanted them to tell me what my son could not. And I have continually found mostly positive experiences on SDR, and just a couple of negatives. So that definitely influenced my decision. You’ve given me a lot to think about and consider. However the damage could potentially be done. I’m now seeking out other individuals with stories like yours. Bc you’re the first person to ever mention the adhesive arachnoiditis and other issues. More than anything I appreciate your honesty and time to explain this to me. I feel like I knew there were risks to this surgery, but they weren’t exactly given a name or detailed. It was more vague terms and ideas of what may happen during surgery or down the road."
CerebralPalsy,fj3znbj,t1_fj3yx4v,1582996882.0,Well fuck. It’s too late now bc we’ve already done it so that can’t be reversed or helped.
CerebralPalsy,fj3x6ny,t1_fj3w1vy,1582995255.0,"Again, I really appreciate your perspective. So my understanding and what sold me on SDR for my son was that it would eliminate his spasticity. I have no idea what it feels like, only that spasticity itself could cause a lot of issues over time. That it’s basically like weights holding down your body. You’re right in that my son was/is pretty mild. He wears AFOs (always has) and is mostly independent. He has always walked/ran independently without a walker/crutches/wheelchair but he fell a lot. Of course he had a weird gait pattern, but my concern was not ‘looks’ as much as long term deterioration. Like with the wheelchair scare. That spasticity would tear his body down much faster. I feel like the not being made fun of or looking ‘normal’ was not what led us to such a major surgery. We were doing all the PT, doing all the stretches, all the things to help him but we’re told no matter how much you do, you’ll never overcome the spasticity. But it sounds like you’d rather have the spasticity and just deal with that instead of these other problems caused by the surgery. Do you remember what your body felt like before the surgery?"
CerebralPalsy,fj3ts4w,t1_fj3ovu2,1582993031.0,"I really appreciate the time you’re taking to respond to me. And your perspective. My son can’t express these types of thoughts to me...and I hope I’m not making him feel that way. My son’s SDR was single level, and I know that there are less negative outcomes with that vs multi level. But you are right on the long term data. I think the longest the single level has been around is 30 years. I felt like I did a fair amount of research and this wasn’t a light decision. I actually agonized other making such a big decision for him. Most things I leave up to my kids to decide. But this was something that (I’m sure you’re aware) was better to do when the kid is younger. I am taking your experience seriously though, and will be seeking more answers and research about rhizotomy outcomes. I mean, I feel like we went into this aware and knew there were/are risks, but I was hard pressed to find negative outcomes on single level. *So your doctors are positive this was caused by the SDR and not other factors or surgery? It’s scary that there’s no cure or help. My son will have MRIs and x rays annually so I hope and expect that we would catch this earlier, which I guess wouldn’t matter given that there’s no cure.  I’m on mobile so I find it hard to format. ***Did you keep up with PT and OT as an adult?"
CerebralPalsy,fj3cr4u,t1_fj2wnid,1582978741.0,They also told us that by his twenties he also could be in a wheelchair. We never did Botox bc I wasn’t comfortable with it. We found out about SDR and felt it was the best option. I did a ton of research but did not come across the issues you said. BUT I was/am skeptically his their is hardly any negative information about this surgery. It’s mostly all positive. I found a few cases who had issues or said it didn’t really help them.

intermittentfasting,fj2eskx,t3_fb22nf,1582941831.0,"I could have made this post!! It’s me. I’m doing the same. I feel great about my fasting bc I usually go longer than 16. But when I’m home and I’m making dinner, I’m also scarfing down a million cookies and having an alcoholic beverage and maybe throw in some chips. But mainly sweets/cookies/donuts/any deserty carbs. Then I eat dinner and don’t eat anything until the next day. It’s frustrating knowing I’m sabotaging myself like this, especially when I feel that I have the fasting on lock. I can go the entire day without snacking or binging. But once I’m home, bets are off. The thing about not keeping carbs at home....judge away if you must, but I have 4 kids, and I buy them sweets and treats, in addition to healthy foods. The kids, however, don’t binge and eat in moderation. I feel guilty denying them snacks bc I can’t handle myself. So I need to just stop myself and get some self control back. That’s not great advice lol but I can relate to your post and am aware of the problem. It’s up to me to make this change. One thing that has helped me and I guess the only advice I can offer is meal prep and making easy meals. For example, if I had/have my dinner ready and all I have to do is heat it up, then I can just eat and then I’m not standing in the kitchen cooking. Or if we order takeout and all I need to do is pick it up. Where I find my struggle is when I cooking meals that take longer to make. Earlier this week I grilled steak, and while i was waiting for it to be done I ate a bunch of snacks."

Teachers in my area do not get fired or in trouble unless they like, molest a kid. It seems like everything else is ok or pushed under a rug.

Verbally abused possibly (well, that sounds strong, but being called dumb by a teacher in front of your peers and being denied the bathroom are unacceptable) as well as no privacy with their information.

Teachers,fiupt0y,t1_fium0ms,1582745998.0,"Yes....but I’m highly paranoid that someone I know will read this. Maybe I should make a throwaway account. But it’s along the lines of saying things LOUDLY and in a harsh way to the students directly about their abilities and their IEPs. Not letting students go to the bathroom then berating them when they get upset/defensive. Calling students dumb in front of other students. Saying to me, again loudly, what’s the deal with {insert students name}? Calling out students in front of the class, which embarrassed them and upsets them, when the conversation could be had in private. I’m just hesitant to give details but the gist is they are saying inappropriate and demeaning things to students in front of everyone in the class. Things that could be said privately to the student at a later time, or not said at all. Or phrased much differently and respectfully. There’s just no reason to be so combative with your language.
