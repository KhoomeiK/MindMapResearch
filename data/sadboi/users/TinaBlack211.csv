I never really talked to anyone about it, but lately I've been trying to explain my feelings a friend and he's been nothing but understanding and supportive and trying to talk me into maybe going to see a professional. And all I've been feeling the whole time is that I'm being selfish and putting on him a burden that is not his to bear. I keep apologising for it even though I know deep down it's what friends are for and it's something I would do for any of my friends no question, but when it's about me... I just feel like I'm too much."

I remember going to movies when it came out and all my girl friends could talk about was 50 Shades of Grey and I didn't wanna watch that out of spite so when I got to the theater I just randomly picked this one and boy was I not sorry about that decision! I wasn't amazed so much by a movie in quite a long time!"
HarryPotterBooks,esfpz9i,t1_ese2xqf,1561932194.0,To be honest I felt that way about OoP. Book was great and the movie was just disappointing. I expected so much and the movie barely scratched the surface of it.

My father doesn't have a son, so me and my sisters helped with a lot of things around the house and honestly I'm very proud of myself to know and am able to do things those ""boy stuff"". I feel stronger, more confident and generally better about myself because of that!"
