depression,eynm1mr,t3_cn5vlj,1567252430.0,I usually wake up crying uncontrollably sometimes. One thing I know for sure as soon as I open my eyes I sink deeper into depression. I just pray that it gets better because I am becoming exhausted spiritually. This is a burden I might not be able to carry. Just tired of feeling like nothing all the time.
spirituality,ey9z047,t3_cvualc,1566955420.0,Life is full of so many ups and downs but just remember that you are powerful in spirit and ultimately you will rise like the phoenix. The struggles often times seem neverending but there are brighter days coming your way. I feel those same emotions all the time but I remind myself that these trials and tribulations will make me an even stronger person. You got this and most importantly God got you.
SingleParents,ey9x1c3,t3_cw8oc6,1566954274.0,"Hello there Queen. I want to let you know that everything will be alright and in due time this too shall pass. I was homeless with my son for 2 years from July 2017 to July 2019, at the time I became homeless my son was just turning 3 months old. We were all alone and I was extremely scared for every passing minute. I spent some time from couch to couch, then at restaurants and then eventually a good samaritan informed me about the Path homeless intake center that would temporarily place me in a family shelter until I was able to find an apartment with their housing vouchers. I thought it would never happen for me and I became extremely depressed. I didn't feel like I was able to carry on but then I looked at my sweet little son and that motivated me to not give up. I just want to tell you that the days will be long but there is heavenly light at the end of the tunnel. 

  It is difficult to find landlords who accept the vouchers where I live in NY but if that is the case where you live, don't let it deter you. Keep on placing those calls and trust me you will get some positive feedback. I also recommend applying for public housing in your state because it doesn't hurt to have two options at the same time, that will definitely increase your chances. I used Zillow, Trulia, ApartmentFinder and craigslist(Please beware of false housing ads that are actually scammers). I genuinely am rooting for you and your son and I know firsthand you will get back into your own place in due time. You are very strong and believe me this process is strenuous but trust me you got this ok. If ever you want me to help you search online for apartments in your area that accept your housong voucher, I'm just one message away.

I apologize for writing such a long post but I literally teared up when I saw your post because It was only 2 months ago that I was in the exact same situation. Don't you worry yourself ok and many blessings to you and your little guy... One Love"

I did have a case manager when I was in the shelter but according to her once I signed that lease, I was no longer her client. Safe to say not the friendliest or most helpful person. I did reach out to one of the local catholic charities in the area but they only had pantry resources available at this time. I am going to keep calling around until I find one that might possibly help with furniture, baby items etc. 
  You've provided so many resources for me that I'm going to look into, I really appreciate you taking the time to advise me in the right direction.

Thank you so much for everything. Sending you positive vibes and blessings.

My son is definitely loving all this space now that he isn't confined to one shelter room. I really enjoy just watching him walking around exploring our little 1 bedroom. A steady job is the main objective now because I want to ensure that my baby boy never ends up homeless again."

One day you can make beeferoni, tacos, burgers, ground beef sandwiches etc. If you don't want to consume meat then I definitely recommend pasta, lots of bread, fresh veggies, soups and definitely some cheese."

SingleParents,ey0v6c7,t3_cuqd4c,1566683941.0,"You have a right to feel the way that you do, especially based on the circumstances you stated. This woman whether knowingly or not is the woman he cheated with so of course you naturally would feel some sense of disdain at her presence on such a special day. That man cheated because of his own insecuirties, lack of loyalty and promiscuity and none of that is your fault. So just look at the glass half full instead of half empty , he is now her long suffering problem to deal with and that is one less burden for you. Your son is most likely an amazing super awesome kid and he will always love you unconditionally and fiercely.
It will be hard but you already handled the toughest part which was the heartbreak while still being a kick-butt super Mommy, so like the dust on your shoulders just brush it off. You are strong and you are resilient. You will find if not already, a wonderful soulmate who will truly appreciate your sunshine and light.

P.s. I am in a similar situation, my son's father abandoned him when he was 3 months old(My son is now 2 years old and he still hasn't seen him since 3months old) and has resorted to allowing the woman he cheated on me with, to childishly contact me with taunts about taking my ex away from me. I told her Thank you so much because you have saved me from a lifetime of deception and heartache. They lose them how they get them...karma."
Assistance,ey0th85,t1_ey0rxwt,1566682933.0,"Thank you so much for being so uplifting and helpful because I am totally new to this site. I already messed up on three posts already today but the Mod was extremely polite and gracious in notifying me about the rules and this site in general. I honestly didn't expect to get so much positive support when I joined an hour ago but I see this is more than a site for posting and commenting. This is a family unit and I appreciate that so much.

I wish you many, many successes and remember never to lose hope. I get down on myself alot but my son is like sunshine for my soul. He just reminds me of how much love and happiness this world contains. So he is my motivation not to lose hope. Now I just sit on the air mattress and cry tears of joy because I have waited for this moment for so long...One Love"
Assistance,ey0s0im,t1_ey0qu4o,1566682411.0,"Thank you so much for the kind words. I thought we would never find a place we can afford in NY. It was and still is rough but I learnt that hard work and perseverance pays off so I worked and worked, then based on my low income the government was able to help me with partial rent. I moved to America 18 years ago from Jamaica and I will say that this place will make or break you. I have to show my son that giving up is never an option even when all the odds are stacked against us. There is always a rainbow at the end of the rainstorm. Reddit seems like a genuine rainbow, loving it so far. I can share my opinions and just connect with a bunch of interesting people."

Assistance,ey0ptvb,t1_ey0pekx,1566681799.0,I am so lost with this. I took out the money part as well. Then I went to the AskMen board to comment on a question and it mentioned I needed 5 karma to post. How can I tell if it is free to post? Or does every post require some karma points.
AskMen,ey0ofv4,t3_cskfte,1566681235.0,"I knew or thought I knew my ex was the one because he had a golden glow around him the first time I saw him. He wasn't the best looking but his aura was enchanting. That was my first and last time having that experience.

My ex actually moved on from me(After 2.5 years of dating excluisvely and livinflg together) when our son turned 3 months, he basically abandoned our family and I haven't seen him since.

2 years later and I am still taking it day by day, I rock back and forth uncontrollably, I cry for atleas a few hours everyday and the depression has been rough but then I look at my son and I thank the heavens for him every single day. He might not have a father in his life but I will be best parent I possibly can to him. Everything will get better in due time."

I am not the smartest person so I might not comprehend certain things but definitely correct me If I ever make any mistakes or do anything to offend. Thank you for your kind words and very cool site you have here. I was living in a shelter in NY for 2 long years and finally got an apartment, even though its the projects I am totally grateful. So I def understand there are always bad apples trying to take advantage of good people. I just lead with love and light and leave it to rhe universe. Have a totally awesome weekend."
