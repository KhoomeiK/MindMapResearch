BPD,fdcu7yo,t3_eko2k2,1578284449.0,"welcome and don’t worry about whether it’s been posted before. we’re all here with similar issues and, sometimes, it’s nice to have a reminder that we’re not alone when it comes to certain situations.

and, i understand what you mean! sometimes i’d be out having the time of my life but there’s this lurking feeling like “this feels unnatural” or “i don’t deserve this happiness” or “this is definitely going to end and i’m going to go back to feeling unhappy.” and this just leads to some irrational attack about how the good is going to end forever and this particular good time is the last one i’d feel.

Most times, i’d feel like i’m a different person around the people i hang out with simply to ensure that the “me” they’re hanging out with is someone they like.

it’s a bittersweet feeling to know that others feel similarly.

i’m sorry if it doesn’t entirely make sense? i’m not very good at expressing this :("
BPD,fdctiep,t3_ekdu6i,1578283870.0,"I felt this, both when i was single and in a relationship. i’d end up in very toxic behaviours, to be honest, and not realise that these people were using my admiration and how i saw them in such a positive light against me. :( i hurt a lot of people in the process, but i’m learning to understand that certain things are just caused by the BPD :( you’re gonna be okay!!"

Tinder,f6okzfy,t1_f6oc5bd,1573021947.0,"22/F here! I think you can move the ""I have a 4.91 uber rating..."" to the top bit of your bio. It's always interesting to know that someone's new in town and that's one of the biggest appeals :P Instead of saying that you ""don't know anyone"" what about something along the lines of ""might need some help getting to know this new place"" instead?

Make the second or third photo your main! Other than that, your photos (and you) are cute!"
Tinder,f6okh6o,t1_f6oczod,1573021352.0,"Hello! 22F here. 

The Smart Photos feature comes in handy but try not to abuse it. That dog is adorable! You could remove the fifth photo (the video) and move the ""day and night mood"" to the last pic. Also move the neon lights loop up to the first few pics! 

Take more photos of yourself, man. You're handsome >:( You just gotta figure out some better angles and get more pics and you're good to go.

Also, I get the appeal of wanting to express a lot but maybe cut down on the emojis. Use that in conversation instead :)"
Tinder,f6ojy5r,t1_f6ofyyv,1573020726.0,"22F here! Make the second one your main, and consider keeping/adding the 1st, 6th, 7th and 10th in. You look good! Group pics are fine but if you're worried about privacy (I know some people are) maybe they're not the best. Also the 3rd pic is sweet but might possibly give off the wrong idea.

Your bio initially made me ""...?"" It might be just me but it came off as a little confusing. You come off as very down-to-earth and serious which isn't necessarily a bad thing *but* perhaps there's a better way to say that you're a captain? There's so many ocean- or pirate-related jokes out there, if you're into that. ""The world's your oyster and I can help you get there"" :P

to the top!Also, that last picture made me swoon. Please move it to the top three.

The “dad bod with a grandma’s car” bio made me laugh ahaha

Imho, I think that 7th picture can be shifted to one of the top three’s - it looks good! The second one can be the fourth pic instead (it looks cute but your smile was what got me first.) You could also consider having that picture of you in the green shirt and the khaki(?) jacket (I must apologise; I’m from a country where the coldest we get is 27°C) in your first few and the second last one (the aesthetic looking one) in your profile! Plus the photo of you and your boys + the car made me swoon (maybe shift that forward and your third one somewhere else)

Also that fourth one can be removed (I know you mentioned it in your bio but you have lots of other strong photos!)

Hehe c:

ALSO. BANDIT IS ADORABLE."
Tinder,f6oanqr,t1_f6o2erl,1573011945.0,"22F here! and NO >:( I think you’re good-looking. But this isn’t the place for a pep talk.

Maybe instead of saying how that first photo is an old “more good looking pic” just say that you cut your hair already. Also what’s that second picture? If you drew that, you could mention that in your bio too! Plus your lil ones are adorable :3 You could talk about that too.

Hope it helps!"
Tinder,f6oadgu,t1_f6ntkhp,1573011728.0,22F here! Your photos are pretty! I think a clearer pic of your face might help though. I think the “bro” thing was funny but maybe that’s just my opinion :P
Tinder,f6oa2bg,t1_f6o9hmy,1573011489.0,"IMHO, I don’t think you gotta add any more pics! That third photo (second before bio) looks great - make it your main please! I’d swipe right :)"

I think even without this bit your bio would be alright :) I like that you explained your pictures!"
