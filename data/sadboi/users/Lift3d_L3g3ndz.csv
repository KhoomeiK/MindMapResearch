conspiracy_commons,flu9wnh,t1_flu84c7,1585498343.0,It was sent to me idk why anyone would do that. Fucking idiots.
OSRSProTips,fkvx001,t1_fkvmaxk,1584578502.0,Thank you
SuicideWatch,fj4rr3w,t3_f9d5go,1583015324.0,Yes all the time I’ve already failed twice at killing myself. I just want to try and be happy and it’s impossible. Too many problems I face everyday due to my brain injury. Feel lonely and I feel like I always will be probably. It’s hard to communicate with people and I always feel in the way. If I could just not exist it would be for the best
SuicideWatch,fj4qwcu,t3_f9d5go,1583014739.0,It would of been so nice to of just died when I was 18 in a car accident instead of continuing to live with this fucking brain injury. I’ve already put a gun to my head once and pulled the trigger and it locked up. Tried to overdose on heroine but woke up. I fail at even that. :(
Ebay,fj2urg3,t1_fj2umcx,1582954684.0,So we need goggles and a $50 face mask lol
Ebay,fizu11c,t3_fap6xy,1582874664.0,Thanks it wasn’t connected to my PayPal. That would have sucked. Lol
Ebay,fizo9av,t3_fap6xy,1582868596.0,So what do I do now? I have a sold item that they aren’t purchasing. Do I canceled it? I just don’t want my fees to go up so not sure how to go about this.
Ebay,fizlp6e,t3_fap6xy,1582866339.0,Right on. I started the eBay account to collect golf balls from golf courses and resell them. None of my golf balls have sold yet though lol. Just the toothbrush that the person no longer needs I guess. Lol
Ebay,fizkz6p,t1_fizke5n,1582865736.0,Just curious man what kind of product can you make for $1 dollar and sell for $50
Ebay,fizk1w9,t1_fizjz75,1582864975.0,Lol so how does one make money on eBay with all those fees and stuff? It makes no sense.
NewSkaters,fiafrfd,t3_f7ag3r,1582300119.0,I used to have a nash skateboard it was so sick. Now I’m riding to a habitat longboard.
