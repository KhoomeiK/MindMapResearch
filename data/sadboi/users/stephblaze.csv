It took a lot of guts to share your story and where you come from, especially on a social media app. I admire you for that and remember that you have all the control in your hands to switch your life around and it’s never to late, really never to late, to be happier than you were before. Believe it or not, people are naturally meant to be there for one another, we just don’t show it or how to, so know that you will never be alone."
