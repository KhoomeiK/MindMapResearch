Thanks to the availability of porn when my fiance was a teen and his having 20 orgasms a day back then, he can now continually have sex with me for four hours and forty-five minutes (at least... we were tired and didn't try for longer).

We also have a better sex life because of porn. It helped both of us realize what we were into and awakened possibilities. For me, it was a gift as I lived in a home where even the mention of sex was considered shameful. I learned things about sex and myself. For him, he realized what he's into isn't weird or the precursor to being a serial killer. In fact, our community is the most popular sexual niche in the world (from what I can tell, though there are varying degrees.)

I had him save for school (or my version of it before University came out) by working a minimum wage job and selling stuff he found on the streets. I subtracted money from his balance with every time I personally scheduled a semester to start (again, pre-University days).

He finally had enough skill built up in several areas that he could get a proper job. I promoted him to an entry level that a new graduate would have.

All generations after him had their educations essentially paid for, or at least a decent amount was given to them by their parents to start out with.
