It seems and though if a person with bpd has a legitimate worry or concern, there is suddenly this view that it is due to their emotions.

On the extreme end, this ends of being a matter of blatant bias and even blaming them regardless of the situation

My doctor sent me a message in response to an inquiry I had about one of my medications. 

He responded by saying "" we can't be changing your doses depending on your mood that week - can we look at skills you've learned to manage your moods ?""

I still don't know if it's "" okay"" for me to feel condescension or take offence.

It's actually allowed me to see what's important , and get creative in ways that I save money ( like cutting and dying my own hair , multi purposing etc).

Like you, I have a pet that makes me smile and comforts me. I have done so much therapy and I feel like I’ve gotten wiser, and made better and different choices, but still suffer tremendously.

Do you have any concurrent disorders ? 
I've been diagnosed with so many that I really don't know what's what. I can't keep up with myself or what my mind is doing, if that makes sense. 
Yesterday I took a concerta and felt joy and clarity again for the first time in so long that I don't remember. 
I picked up my months worth today and will be careful with it and the side effects and high addiction potential. 


This forum has been SO great. I hadn't found anywhere before that just us ladies with adhd could talk so openly and really share the raw struggles. 
I have been diagnosed 5x with adhd and I have found no natural way of alleviating it yet. I wish no one suffered like this. :(
I'm so sorry. I hope we get to chat more. I am not leaving this forum! It's all I have left as hope that maybe someone will share their breakthrough or strategies that really work. Let's not give up okay? At the very least, we know someone out there gets what we go through. Xo"

I never give up hope, as I've seen my life get a lot better , then bad again, so on and so fourth. 
I would never attempt suicide again, because it was the most painful experience for not just me but my family.

I live for hypomania ( I don't experience mania ).
I will not go on mood stabilizers because if I lose my hypomania, I have nothing to look forward to. 

I have played around with and abused even over the counter medications to manipulate my mood. I will not eat until say 3-4pm, I'll drink coffee and take specific meds which often mimic hypomania.

What I suggest ( take it or leave it ) and something I learned is that we don't have to always share our feelings or depend on another to comfort or validate us. We have to learn to validate ourselves , and use our skills to work through the feelings and situation. Do you think if you wrote him about things that didn't relate to feelings, and only plans or situations he's involved in- do you think things would improve?

BPD,fhtrjq7,t3_f4npmm,1581877341.0,"Hey :) 
I distinctly remember when my psych said that I don't want to let go of my old self /my classic bpd traits. I accepted this because I knew, just like you that part of me didn't. Why? Well because of the unknown. Because I knew myself the way I was, and the fear of change and unknown made me resist changing. 
But I did. I worked through rage and guilt , and by doing so found many answers. It took a while to transition, but it happened gradually. 
We know how to get by and how to function as we are , all bad behaviours and habits included. 
Please don't feel alone in this. When you know yourself as one way it's terrifying to jump into an entirely different way of existing. We have these maladaptive behaviours because we know that they work, if only temporarily or they have consequences. 
It's not weird or rare to fear change , especially when it means losing the self you've come to know.

If I told you of all the bad shit I've done , you'd definitely feel like an Angel lol. 
Not kidding. 

Anyway, it's your girlfriends choice whether she wants to stay with you, and she has chosen to stay with you. That leads me to believe that you must have some very good qualities. 

It helps to see that sometimes we see things in all black or all white ( good or bad). The challenge is to see the grey. Say hey, I have selfish thoughts , I have done a few things wrong , but I'm remorseful . I know x y and z about myself ( the good attributes ). 

When things go really wrong or there's a crisis moment, we don't think logically. We're not in wise mind. 
By the way, I'm sorry for the ways that your parents have affected you. I totally relate, and it's soooo hard not to want to blame them. However , you can't blame yourself for things beyond your control. 

I'll check back here when I wake up, k? 
Goodnight from Canada :)"
bipolar2,fgki1cg,t1_fgkgvlp,1580866037.0,Thanks for answering. Anxiety is cruel isn’t it .
SuicideWatch,fgkhwpv,t3_eyrvv0,1580865953.0,"Right now it’s horrible bullshit. I’ll take your word. I validate that and won’t question your experience. No feeling is final 🦋If you had a friend who’s in your exact situation, what advice would you give them?"
SuicideWatch,fgkhlhu,t3_eyxr60,1580865747.0,"I remember having so much acne and being so ashamed, wanting to hide. I had crazy anxiety and was awkward. People said really mean stuff and I wish I would’ve stood up for myself. Bullies are insecure and they will end up with issues . Trust in that! Can you talk to your parents, a counsellor etc? Xo"
SuicideWatch,fgkhdvj,t3_eyzja5,1580865609.0,"Can I tell you a secret? I tried last year. At 35 years old. Woke up in the ICU and have had to live with the embarrassment and shame since. No one wants to get close to me, really. I’m mentally ill and probably always will be. However, I’m not special in that..
You know what else stops me ?Being honest here...I think of the slight possibility of hell, and I know that’s fucking scary to me . Then I think of ripping apart my families life for the rest of their lives, and I feel selfish. 
SO, I just take comfort in the THOUGHT that there’s a way out , but I sort of leave it there."
SuicideWatch,fgkh06e,t3_eyxcgt,1580865358.0,"If I knew what the hell we were living for I’d certainly tell you. Often I think it’s just to suffer. Other times I think it’s to experience. Maybe it’s to reproduce . Regardless, I’m happy I’m in Canada where I can’t buy a gun. I feel you, but I also feel like you should know how many millions of people feel like you , right now. 
Can you do something for me? Go take a picture of that favourite spot and upload it. It sounds awesome if it’s the last thing you’d ever like to look at . 🙋🏻‍♀️🇨🇦"
SuicideWatch,fgkgjug,t3_eyyunv,1580865057.0,"I think about it often, and I let it remain just a calming thought. I understand ."
SuicideWatch,fgkgglz,t3_eyt1pb,1580864995.0,Left a comment from my own YouTube channel with my Instagram link asking her to dm me. Let’s hope 🙁
SuicideWatch,fgkg0zq,t1_fgjyn3u,1580864703.0,I’m in Canada. Perhaps I can help

To err is human....but...Some people kill their families. Some are rapists. Some are narcissistic pieces of shit who abuse others.

Try to put it into that perspective. Can you top that?"
SuicideWatch,fgkfje8,t3_eyyk9l,1580864372.0,"The small part of me that believes hell exists keeps me from jumping off a bridge. People say that to comfort loved ones left behind, because it helps to imagine them without pain or suffering, and flying around with angels.  I guess I get it."
bipolar2,fgkc1qw,t3_eyu9za,1580862074.0,Bp2 rapid cycler and adhd woman here who thinks you’re kick ass! Sending love and support !
bipolar2,fgkbz26,t1_fgjro8r,1580862024.0,Hey quick question if you don’t mind ...do you find a lot of symptom overlap ? Or have you ever been misdiagnosed as having BPD? Thank you 😊
