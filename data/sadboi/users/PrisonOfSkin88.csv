I wish the human body would not even be able to reproduce unless the person had reached a very high level of conciousness and had the ability to properly love, raise and care for their children without traumatizing the shit out of them and ruining their lives. Maybe it's silly but I often think about what my own life and the world in general could have been like if it worked this way..."

dsbm,fou0soi,t1_fotxrxq,1588072815.0,Yes indeed.
SuicideWatch,fonwr8p,t1_fonpsh6,1587927990.0,"What the fuck? How can you even say that! We are human beings and human beings have a huge need for connection, love and belonging. This has NOTHING to do with codependency, this has to do with being incredibly lonely and suffering to the point where you feel like you might as well commit suicide because you can't take the loneliness and isolation anymore...

People who say we don't need others, they usually have no experience of what it is to be truly lonely or they have shut down (usually as a coping mechanism) to the point where they don't think we need other human beings and that we just need to love ourselves etc. and that is just cruel and total BS. I'm not saying it's bad to spend time with and try connecting to yourself but hopefully you get the point.  
All of us have NEEDS and the need for real, safe and meaningful connection is HUGE for most of us (if not all of us) but many people don't realize this because they have no idea how it's like to live without it for years and years. So we don't ''need to learn to be alone'', most of us have already been forced to learn how to survive being alone for far too long and that's why we are still on this fucking planet.

So being connected and feeling like you belong with other human beings is essential to our mental, emotional and physical well being and has NOTHING to do with codependency, so don't even go there.

  
(I know I've repeated myself but I feel like this can not be stressed enough.)"

SuicideWatch,fomi2l4,t3_g85j5t,1587890823.0,"Yes, pretty much all the time.. I always feel misunderstood in one way or another (even if someone says they understand) and it feels like it doesn't matter how much I try to explain my thoughts and feelings, it just feels like others can't even imagine, understand or connect with the depth and severity of what is going on inside of you all the time. It's a very painful and lonely space to be in."
