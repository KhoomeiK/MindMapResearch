dauntless,fleg0d9,t1_flebyql,1585083676.0,"From what I’ve seen myself is that to really take advantage of wounding is to run savagery as well but it seems reminiscent of CB needing weighted strikes to boop (before their rework). Also wound damage is limited. Part wounded? No more wound damage. Don’t get me wrong I’ve grown to dig wound damage because of savagery. As always it also comes down to play style. Dauntless has a good amount of options for you to figure out what you like HOWEVER if you want wounded parts ASAP. Warpike is the tool for the job. Personally I don’t think wound damage is weak. I think it is confined to a weapon some people don’t like.  The best you can do is run Acidic which I’d say is the best way to fill out beast mastery.  Throw Acidic 3 (all you need) on and just go. Great on strikers.
