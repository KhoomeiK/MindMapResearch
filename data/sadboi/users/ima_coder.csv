That immigrant is not a threat (usually). If they are a threat, they are not a threat to the country as a whole, they are a threat to a very, very small percentage of the country.

I'd need to see some sources on this, and anyway, immigration laws are generally not about the quality of the individual coming in but a resource allocation issue where Americans should come first and have access to what the immigrant would use first.
