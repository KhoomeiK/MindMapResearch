Can you mistake DR for depression ?

I find my mind’s eye terrifying a lot of the time when thinking about mundane things, esp objects in my surroundings, whatever is in front of me, looking outside, up at the sky.. I’ll stare at the ends of objects and get dread anxiety or take note of all the ‘things’ I can see and then go in a deep dark pit or look at where a cloud starts and where my window cuts it off and get suicidal anxiety, immediately! ..

Then I was thinking, why are these random surrounding relentlessly making me feel dread.. And then I realised it’s probably my thoughts.. and sure enough I close my eyes and no matter what I think about, it looks terrifying and gives me suicidal dread

I am able to distract myself and I still do things and laugh a lot, but I find this is my neutral idle state and I am so puzzled as to what it is?

So I either thinking it’s a derealisation symptom where I am automatically and always unable to observe my thoughts and feelings without it sending me into immediate despair or I have a big depression which I’ve been in denial about (although I still wanna do things in life)

And it’s always only when I think about it, I would say I am content and doing things with enthusiasm when not thinking about it, like back to normal when I’m focused and then when I think about it BOOM

It’s like I’m fine fine fine fine fine then I think about the feeling and instantly back in it and then the only way to get out of it is by not remembering to think about it 

Any thoughts dp/dr army? Thank you for reading"
