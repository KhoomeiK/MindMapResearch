Kava,fok7sjm,t1_foi2z6s,1587836993.0,I've actually started just eating some snacks or a light meal beforehand and that seemed to help a bit. I also starting yesterday cut down my daily consumption in general. :)

I have been taking it really often the past month."
socialanxiety,foi11mt,t3_g756fe,1587776534.0,"It's my favorite for social anxiety relief! I'd suggest checking out any nearby Kava Bar shops in your state first. It's a guarantee that they are making it right. I suggest ordering the traditional kava to get the full effects.

If you don't have a local Kava bar, go to Kalm Kava Website. They offer a variety like micronized instant kava, or kava in powder form to make traditionally.
It's a 15 minute process, but totally worth it.
They have directions on the back on how to make it. Or, just message me!
Some people have a reverse tolerance, so it requires some time for the body to start feeling the effects.
It also requires you to drink it on an empty stomach to feel the majority of the effects.
Once you get used to it and experiment, you'll be able to find the type that works best for you, and how to consume it!
:)
It's absolutely worth looking into and trying it correctly.
It has helped me a ton.
Feel free to ask any questions!
There is also a Kava group here on reddit that has a lot of information!"

Trust your intuition.
It's totally fine to set boundaries within your relationship."
