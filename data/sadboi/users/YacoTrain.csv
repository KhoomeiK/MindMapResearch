truetf2,fr5bvda,t1_fr5azma,1589905986.0,"This is going to be my last reply because I'm not try to argue with you any further. 

My post was telling people to not treat me like their personal pocket and to wait for the team which is something the game doesn't tell you and is more of a social thing. Your post was saying that I should build Uber, a major game mechanic.

My post was a rant. A rant to people who think the e key is like a second emote key. A rant to people who think I have to follow them into 3 sentries because they want to feel badass. A rant to people who have no awareness to the game.

And then you responded with how I should play the game. I know how to play the game, that's why I'm ranted about people who don't.

I feel like you just misunderstood what I was trying to convey, which is ok. Like I said, in not going to argue with you anymore about this because frankly I don't care."
truetf2,fr58ofx,t1_fr5863e,1589904440.0,"Like I said, I've been playing since tf2 came to linux. I'm not expecting my team to play how I want them to, but I do expect them to not make my life hard. My team constantly has heavys run into sentry fire and then get upset when I wasn't there pocketing them while I'm trying to heal my teammates who are actually pushing the objective. 

Your post looked like a play by play how to tutorial that that was very condescending. Next time, don't act like the person has never touched the game before, because people who do that are usually those that just picked up tf2 themselves are are eager to tell someone the most basic information."

- I'm obviously building Uber

- I'm not way in the back with the back with the sniper, I'm up with the team. The mention of healing a sniper was from a payload game on Snowycoast.

- the dumb heavy dying against sentries are the kids who think they're invincible and expect me to follow them to their death. They run from spawn right to payload surrounded by sentries without waiting for me to have Uber or waiting for the team to be there or waiting for someone to pick off the sentries.

Your whole comment is extremely condescending. I know how to play the game, you sound like you have no idea how it feels to be medic with a team of children who only think of you as their personal pocket. 

IMHO you sound like you just watched some YouTube videos and now think you're some kind of tf2 expert"
truetf2,fr52ct1,t1_fr4c1eh,1589901261.0,I'm sorry is the medic suppose to use a rocket launcher? I used the term to mean the type of weapon. Like refering to all of snipers primarys as just sniper rifles
