AnxietyDepression,flmwe9c,t3_fpt14a,1585299491.0,"yes same here   


when I look back I remember the time my father squeezed a glass until it's broken, the times my mom sitting depressed outside kitchen, the times that I was jealous of others' parents and how I hated myself and this life 

People often say , don't look back, it's in past, the future is in your hands.  But while I am a financially independent woman right now, supporting myself and my cat, I still feel like I was still that helpless girl and this life is way too hard and pointless"

BPD,fcmhjy7,t3_ehxkuc,1577775527.0,"I am not sure whether have BPD but I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. 

My life almost mirror yours.  I was 21 when I first met a 44 year old married man who said he loved me and he was gonna leave his second wife for me.   
Of course it was a lie and I was abandoned hard.  After him, it was a string of married older man who are all almost 2 decades older than me. 

I am not sure whats wrong with me.  Honestly I was considered pretty objectively but there is no single similar aged guys interested in me ever. All I attracted are older married guys.  May be as you said, it's the vulnerability and absent father issue."
abusiveparents,fcim5ue,t1_fcglu8w,1577664883.0,"Thanks for writing all these. 

I guess sometimes it just makes me feel I’m unlovable.  Like , even my parents did not love me, the two people who are supposed to love me, how can someone else ? 

Not to mention this past set me off with a series of guys who definitely scream ‘daddy issue’ of me.  I’m a mess in relationships.  I’m not sure whom to blame , just me or my long gone parents."

And it got me into too many crappy relationships coz I easily fell for it when someone just showed me a tiny bit of approval. And then it eventually fell apart because it would never be enough"
regretfulparents,fc52qwj,t3_e0w0hw,1577440094.0,"no you are not  
and I am so happy for your wife that she has a husband who would stand up for her against his own family.   
It's everything that your partner understands, supports and stands up for you while you need it.    


You are a good husband and don't give that up just because someone ""may have good intention""."
BPD,fbwkaj8,t1_fbwadvj,1577152170.0,"Yes that’s what I feel too 

I cannot even follow some cute cats pages ( I love cats) because they would share info about stray cats, or some stray cats stories that broke my heart"
childfree,fan1rpq,t3_e9s05t,1576220253.0," Cue ALL THESE FUCKING WOMEN saying their kids are their pride and joy, how they didn't want kids either but now they love it blah blah blah.   


I think they probably secretly regretting it but they could not say it because they don't want to be seen as ""bad moms"" or ""bad person"".  They just have to put the show on and pretend they love the children now that they cannot get rid of them."

HongKong,f9m4mhy,t1_f9lrij7,1575441388.0,"I don't think the fact that she is not able to hide her zip ties and/or handcuffs is a justification for her to sit one someone's head.   And that someone is obviously a teenager who would not be strong enough to fight back or escape at this point.    


Plus, she has a bag with her which is obviously big enough for a few pair of handcuffs, in case you did not notice."

depression,f7ncie6,t3_dx2la6,1573895487.0,"I experienced the exact same thing and I am actually glad that I read so many similar experiences here.   I used to be a straight -A student (I got grades in public exam which is good enough for me to skip the final year of secondary school and got into Uni)   


But now (after almost a decade of on and off Anxiety and depression) I could not focus on a conversation or reading a book..  


It feels so shit and just strengthens my beliefs that I am now useless.    


I thought it was physical and turns out ...I think at a certain level it is too.  After taking Vitamin B supplements for a few months, I do feel better and more focus.  But of course also I have anemia and other physical problems."
AnxietyDepression,f4pjaul,t1_f4iqrm0,1571733805.0,Thank you.  I’m not sure whether I can write to the monstrous father or my aiding and abetting late mother .. but thanks for being kind and I will try to figure out what to do.
AnxietyDepression,f454oi7,t1_f453foy,1571365997.0,"I went to a few therapists when I was more suicidal. But I guess they are more concerned about the “now” than the past.  It seems they don’t really want me to drill on the past and I know I probably shouldn’t. 

All my childhood friends (girls) know about these but i guess it’s too hard on them either.  Plus everyone have their own issues to deal with and their lives to live. 

And I did reveal these to some men before. I guess the first off sympathy makes them wanna protect me or admire me for turning out into what I’m today despite all that.  But then the trauma was still there and I was not any normal girlfriend they have expected I guess. 

I guess that’s what makes me venting here.  Seems to be my last choice. 

And it really did not have the same effect on my younger sister. But we do have quite different personalities."
AnxietyDepression,f3xcbmo,t3_dil9c1,1571235867.0,"Me too. 

I was chubby and i used to think losing weight would fix everything. 

Then I lost weight and I thought that will help me find my true love and life will be good. 

But looking good in society standard just gives me more and more heartbreaks than ever. 

And you could never be good enough and perfect in others’ eyes.  

I am still trying to make peace with myself.  I know what is not the right thing to do but I’m still searching for the right way."

AnxietyDepression,f2ymfq4,t1_f2ygv89,1570493963.0,"I used to think because the men I dated are not empathetic. Then I jumped from boyfriend to boyfriend.

I really start to think no one will ever understands me."
