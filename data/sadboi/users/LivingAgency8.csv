I also quarantine relapsed on them, and been working at quitting for a couple months. I'm on day 2 at the moment, it's been much easier than the last few times I've tried to quit, I think because I accepted that I was actually going to do it and felt the freedom. 

Having the sense of taste and smell back is wonderful, seeing the money I'm saving from not smoking is great too. I use a different app, and I've tried quite a few over the past year(when I seriously started trying to quit). Not everyone needs a long time to quit, some just decide one day they're done, and thats it. 

You're about 10 years younger than me, and I can promise you, if you don't quit, you'll just get back up to the same amount you smoked before eventually and then you'll be kicking yourself for not quitting back then. Just go easy on yourself, accept that you've had a setback, and make a plan for the future. 

Taking quitting smoking as one day at a time also helps, I'm fairly confident I can go today without smoking, so that is my goal. Just the one day, if I decide tomorrow that I want to smoke, at least I'll have had today off the smokes. The days tend to stack up when you only focus on today.
