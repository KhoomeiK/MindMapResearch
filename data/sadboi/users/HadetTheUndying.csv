iiiiiiitttttttttttt,fqm3zgq,t1_fqm2r8p,1589471109.0,"The process of disabling Fast Boot requires most users to google the solution. It's an option hidden in the Windows UEFI loader. It's not that it's a bad feature, though it wouldn't be necessary if Windows could actually boot quicky, it's that the solutions for turning it off or getting around it are not easily visible when there is a problem that requires it to be off.

These kind of solutions are mind boggling to me as a daily Linux and Mac user because most Windows users will go ""that's a lot of work"" because I have a terminal open, but won't bat an eye about having to go through some convoluted process to disable fastboot, or modify registry files to *disable*  telemetry or tracking services to *speed up* their PC.

Back in say 2006 you could mine on a single graphics card or even your CPU. 

Now the monetary investment in hardware is much higher. That doesn't mean that you won't see a reward for your monetary investment but you have to be realistic about the electricity costs as well. this kind of rapid mining mentality is also incredibly bad for the environment because of how electricity is generated. 

the people that are really mining large blocks understand this already and have been doing so for quite a long time. They are either large groups or companies dedicating large sums of money to mining hardware or individuals that I've been doing this for a long period of time who have reinvested their money."

This is a good thing however, as it stops inflation because it's slowing the rate coins are introduced to the market. It guarantees that Bitcoin will remain a mostly sound investment and a decent currency for making transactions. In fact it should stabilize the value and make it a more sound investment for just making general transactions. The get rich phase of Bitcoin might be over though.
