Pro tip: buy some velcro tape and velco your phone to your rack ceiling. Instant movie theatre. 

Anyways. I'd get one with the best battery life as you can get. (Charging outlets isn't the most convenient thing) and also as much ports.

I never had any problem with taxes before so I was uninformed. IRS would only send out mail for official stuff + having a tight family budget, got me at such a perfect time to panic about a call like that. 

They were using real names and IRS agent numbers to try and make it sound real.
