I honestly think the protestors' POV has merit and I understand how people could respond to us city people complaining about inconvenience with 'the indigenous folk have had it worse for longer'. But at the same time, it is difficult to be compassionate when faced with more than an inconvenience. Losing income isn't just an inconvenience, especially since start of the month is coming up (and so are bill payments).

What has helped me is being an outgoing person who isn't afraid to speak up at work. Being kind/fair but assertive has worked well for me. Other things that have helped are caring about the work the technicians I work with do, trying to find ways to make their lives easier, and not pointing fingers to blame people *when it isn't necessary* (e.g. if an operator made an honest mistake and I can see ambiguity in work instructions, I would talk to the operator to clarify, fix ambiguity in work instructions, then send a general email to the whole team explaining the defect and fix without outing the person who made it)."

Both are rhizomous, meaning if you leave any pieces of rhizome (basically roots) in the ground when you go to remove them, they will grow back from the bits left behind. 

If you know the weeds aren't rhizomous or dangerous (e.g hogweed which normally isn't in backyards but best to confirm first), I'd just spend some time in spring pulling them out. Timesink but affordable. I'd buy a [weeder](https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/yardworks-stainless-steel-hand-weeder-0592788p.0592788.html?gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_5rtBRDxARIsAJfxvYCDmpLZVR4YYY79Quijf5oXj6kBLMwI8w7Xg2HIa9fxHgTWkJLbghsaAnYNEALw_wcB#store=45), metal trowel, soft pad to kneel on, paper bags for waste, and gardening gloves. Should be like $25 all in + your free time. 

I've heard of people burning the weeds away by covering the sections of concern with saran wrap and letting the sun scorch them over a few weeks, but ive never tried this myself. 

Imo the best way is to dig up the weeds/soil, put down some landscape fabric in areas you're going to use for garden beds, put soil down, and sod / plant your beds.

The winter isn't too bad here thankfully - it's noticably worse even a little further away like Cambridge. It CAN be bad here, but it doesn't last forever like in other cities.

For me, waterproof winter boots were the most important thing (i got ones that were just slightly above my ankle but not full boot height). The sidewalks can often be full of snow / not shovelled, and if it's a high traffic area it gets all slushy. I feel like i can deal with almost anything as long as my feet aren't wet haha. Got my boots during one of SAIL's big sales - they are located in Burlington.

I got a thermal base layer (pants) for when i lived in Cambridge and bussed everywhere - wore them under my work clothes. It was frequently -20c there, but IMO you could do without in Hamilton.  I got mine from Winners for like $15.
