The only thing that ages you is that you have visible (but early stage) sun damage, otherwise known as melasma. You need skin care, not plastic surgery.

I suggest doing some serious research about sun damage, aging, and skin cancer. Then, you can easily fix your complexion and avoid more melasma and other issues. 

Check out r/skincareaddiction and this thread [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/30PlusSkinCare/comments/bheanm/what_products_worked_for_your_melasma/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) for what to do about your melasma. Everyone’s skin reacts a little differently.

Women do find it empowering and it’s not your place to tell her what is empowering and not for HER. 

However, majority of sex workers/social worker advocates will tell you Decrim is for safety, not for privileged women selling feet pics for fun to play class tourism. It’s empowering for these women because they are already privileged. They’re empowered to begin with.

What is so complex about sex work is that decriminalization helps make the working conditions better for those who are vulnerable. It makes women less likely to be murdered. 

But are we ever going to fully eradicate porn and sex work? How are we ever going to actually make it go away? We can’t. One must come to accept it’s bigger than we are. 

Instead, I urge you to educate yourself on harm reduction and how to make the lives of vulnerable sex workers better and safer — what that looks like and what organizations work within those frameworks."

And regardless There are issues with a high DUI rates simply because more people drive in North America. However, I do truly believe that Europe and the UK both have more pervasive drinking cultures, which give way to more lenient liquor/drinking laws which just don't exist in North America, and that is largely due to the legacy of prohibition in both the USA and Canada.

Now in Canada they have the issue of driving while high since marijuana has been legalized. There are ""canna-checks"" where they test for both alcohol and weed."
