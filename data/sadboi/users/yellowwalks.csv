If things don't change, or you think your parents won't do anything at all, a good person to talk to is a teacher at school that you trust, or a guidance counselor. Be very clear that you want help if you can. They are people that are not only obligated to help you by law, but they will want to help because they care (I was a teacher, so trust me on this!). 

It can be scary to reach out, share our pain, and expose our family's stuff, but I believe that you have the strength and guts to do it. It is 100% okay to look after you. Don't let anyone convince you to be quiet and suffer for the sake of ""family"" or whatever. You are worthy of more than that. 

Sending lots of love your way."

ptsd,fgeghtn,t3_exz3tl,1580699009.0,"Yes, very much so. I've lost that ability to be assertive, and fight for myself, or stand up for my opinions, especially when stressed. I've been working on this in therapy, but it's hard. 

My trauma is medical related, and this makes it really hard to advocate for myself with my (many) doctors. I just get terrified they will think I'm a difficult patient, and write me off. It helps to have someone else with me at appointments, but I really would love to have a professional advocate to help me (I'm looking into it). Obviously, I can't rely on others forever, but it would be great to help me during this period of my life."

wholesomememes,ffpt1wg,t1_ffka53i,1580104653.0,"I recommend listening to some podcasts. I got started by listening to The Adventure Zone. You can pick up a lot of how the game works, and the rules from it (or so many others). Starting from the first campaign is my suggestion. 

I'm still a (fairly) new player, but I love it. I found a dm that is good with new players on reddit. There's a subreddit to even help people find others to play with (either online or local to you). I'll try to find it to link for you. That way, even if no one you know plays, you can still hook up with a group. 

In the meantime, check out the many dnd subreddits. Just search for dnd, and you'll find lots. :)"

medicalmarijuana,ffownwg,t3_euc51u,1580082657.0,"I rely mostly on tinctures that are around a 1:1 mix and usually a hybrid during the day, and indica at night. 

I did just get a stavia vape that's low cbd/high thc, and it's surprisingly great for my depression symptoms. I also have a lot of physical health problems, and wanted to get something that kicked in quickly, so got this vape to just try. I've been pleasantly surprised. I do like taking some cbd oil too though, as I do find I need a bit higher cbd for some symptoms (and it helps relax me even more). I may invest in a dry herb vape too, so I can take flower that works well long term too."
AskReddit,ff575d4,t3_erdojr,1579582175.0,"What about us tea drinkers? A bag thrown into a cup with some hot water would be about the same amount of time/work. 

Same with anyone ordering only a bottle of water, etc. 

I'd be very annoyed if I was buying something just as easy as a black coffee, and had to wait in a longer line just because it was not black coffee."

service_dogs,fetrxmg,t3_eqk577,1579379254.0,"Agreed. My sd is a very weird combo for a sd, and a rescue, but she works so hard, loves to train and learn, and I get compliments all the time on how good she is (including a trainer who has said she is doing great). 

I always figure it's like 99.9% of things: you have to work with what is best for you. If a traditional breed works best for you, great! If a shelter dog with an unknown background works, great too! So long as the dog is happy, healthy, behave well, and do their tasks... that's what matters."
TheOCS,femns9f,t3_eptovk,1579264016.0,"I use tinctures usually for all my medical issues, but decided to order this vape after seeing so many good reviews. I figured it might be good as something to have for quicker relief. 

I was not disappointed! 2 short hits and I felt a lot of symptom relief, and just very happy. Considering my depression has been bad, that's such a good thing. It was easy to use too, especially for someone who has never vaped before."
