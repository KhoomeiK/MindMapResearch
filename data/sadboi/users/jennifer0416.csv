Advice,fns261m,t1_fnr6o5s,1587210218.0,"What bothers me isn't the videos. We both watch porn, and I don't have a problem with that. What bothers me, as I explained to him last night, is the fact that these are ""real"" people he's soliciting attention from. It feels like that's crossing a boundary. Like, there's a difference between watching Alexis Texas on the hub vs reaching out to women as YOURSELF on social media.

He looked me in the eyes and told me he just accepts friend requests, doesn't send them, and doesn't talk to anyone. There's one confirmed lie in there, so I dont put much stock in the rest of it.

I just feel like what one puts in to a relationship, one should expect to get out of it. If I'm giving you my undivided sexual/romantic attention, you're literally just mooching off of that whilst not providing it in return. That's what makes me most angry, I suppose. The unequal in the give and take."

pregnant,fhzcdc1,t3_f5ie9q,1581995917.0,"It's YOUR birthing experience. If she isn't being compliant, let the nurses know that no one is allowed in that room under any circumstances. It's sad. The only excitement over baby is so understandable, but not what it starts to cross a line and becomes disrespectful to the new mommy. Who wants to be crowded at a time like that? Best wishes to you, mama."
pregnant,fhyy8pn,t3_f5et4b,1581986543.0,"16 weeks here as well, with an entirely planned pregnancy. And I 100% agree. When I tell people this will be my only child because of how shitty this experience has been so far, I get a lot of mean looks. That's not to say I'm not happy about my baby, about being a mom, but the process is grueling!

Props to you for being honest about your feelings. It isn't easy, but we shouldn't feel guilty about it. Pregnancy is a very, very difficult time. You're doing great, mama."

StopSelfHarm,fdlt0ek,t3_elyalr,1578531790.0,"First of all, you are not a failure of a father. Quite the opposite, you're trying to help your daughter. You sound like an awesome dad. 

I struggled with non-suicidal self-harm and spent two years in DBT (dialectical behavior therapy). One thing that really aided my progress was doing something called a ""chain"" with my therapist each time I had cut. We went through each part of the event together, from the moment I picked up the razor, to the moment I put it down. Questions like, ""what were you doing when you decided to pick up the razor? Why did you pick the one that you did? How did you feel after the first cut? When did you know when to stop?"" It was uncomfortable to think about, let alone verbalize, but questions like that helped me better pick out and understand my triggers -- the reasons/events that prompted the self-harm. 

After we had identified my triggers, we worked on coping mechanisms to help fight the urge in the moment. She had me make a ""pros and cons of cutting"" list. Ex) pro, I feel better for a second. Con, I have to wear long sleeves, it makes my family sad to see, I could accidentally kill myself, etc. As you can imagine, the cons greatly outweighed the pros. Seeing the consequences on paper was a big deal for me. 

For physical coping mechanisms, I tried a number of things: holding ice in both hands until it became unbearable, brushing my wrists with soft-brissel toothbrush, eating a piece of very cinnamony/sour candy. All good things to take care of that urge, but none of the harm or risk. 

Just remember that recovery is not linear. It's very curly, and relapses happen. The important thing is to learn a little bit more from each of them. When you know yourself, know your triggers, and know your coping skills, you can beat it. 

Best of luck to you and your daughter. Again, you're wonderful for wanting to help."

He says he already doesn't like the hours, but part of me feels a little resentment because, well, that was his choice. Coordinating vacation time is a great idea though. I'm hoping we could swing at least one day a month."
Advice,fcat8dc,t1_fcast4h,1577576149.0,"Household chores have been my go-to for keeping occupied so far. Even with the schedule change, we've been pretty good at keeping the cleaning 50/50, so there's only so much for me to do. I more so miss the company, above all else.

I got a call from my doctor today. HCG quant levels plummeted all the way down to 40. He confirmed it was a miscarriage and the bleeding is just result of left over placenta making its way out of the uterus. 

BF and I are upset and disappointed but optimistic about the future. Trying to believe everything happens for a reason and all will work out in good time. Sending much love and thoughts of peace to you all ‚ù§"
