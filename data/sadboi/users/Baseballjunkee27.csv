Aquariums,fq6zm7v,t1_fq6yndz,1589139877.0,Heck yea!! It‚Äôs so much fun and interesting. Something else that‚Äôs easy to breed and fun are Corydoras. They are fun to watch drop their eggs everywhere. I have albinos and pandas that drop eggs constantly. They are in my community tank so their eggs turn into a nice treat. I plan on doing a 20 long during summer and making that a Corydora playground. Just have them everywhere in the tank.
Aquariums,fq6y3uu,t1_fq6wim2,1589139332.0,"So the red tail with a little red in his belly took exactly 3 weeks for the tail and 5-6 weeks for his belly to start showing. I have some fry that I bred with an endler. Now those are coming out awesome. They have lots of orange, yellow, purple and greens. They started showing 75% color at 2-3 weeks but still hard to sex them. I feel bad culling them when you can‚Äôt see 100 and 10 percent their full colors but out of my 3 moms, I currently have over 100 fry. I lost one of my beautiful moms after she gave me 27 fry. I was bummed out, but hoping one of the fry resemble her. 

I did notice one thing, when I started dropping in Hikari algae wafers, they started coloring up more. Not sure if that‚Äôs even scientific or not, but from batch one having minimal algae to batch 2 and 3 which have two to three wafers per day and lots of color. 

Let me know if you have anymore questions. It‚Äôs super fun and enjoyable. I‚Äôm actually setting up a 55 gallon planted guppy tank that I‚Äôm going to split down the middle and have makes and females. Then I‚Äôll have a 10 gallon tank set up for sexy time lol .

I tried the breeder box a couple times and more fry were eaten that way by the mom than fry birthed and immediately free swimming."
