islam,f0cbjm4,t3_d453va,1568538254.0,Brother this is same situation I'm going through now. I'm an introvert like you. Currently I'm  going through Depression and Anxiety. I know it's hard when you're in this situation all you get is negative thoughts. I keep getting suicidal thoughts but the thing is I tell my problems to Allah and ask him to get rid of my problems. I'm someone who prays 4-5 prayers a day sometimes I feel like not praying because of my current situation. But I try my best to get up and pray because I've nowhere to seek help but Allah. These thoughts we get are from shaitan. Remember you won't be punished whatever bad thoughts that crosses your mind unless you act on it. There are times I lose hope and feel suicidal. But I always look at the brighter side of my life.  Brother there are many Muslims who go through these phase like you. Remember you're not alone.

MuslimMarriage,eycaley,t3_cvs8w4,1566999086.0,I am going through same stage as you. Everyone around has got married. Seeing Videos and Posts everyday of people getting married makes me depressed. I never had a relationship or talk to any girls. I think to myself whether anyone is going to marry me for the way I am. I'm shy guy when talking or meeting people. First thing what I did is I stopped using Social Media it helped me somewhat and then I started having faith in Allah Plans. It's so difficult but please remember you will be rewarded for your patience. In Sha Allah hopefully you'll get your Life Partner.
