JohnMayer,fmn7r7n,t3_fw8yqc,1586219996.0,"This might be an unpopular opinion but I just don’t like the:

‘Great Indoors’

I cant put my finger on exactly why, I think it’s just that compared to other songs to me it’s nothing special, and the melody kind of bothers me, kind of reminds of stereotypical angsty rom com music"

BPD,eueuf10,t3_cg4zi9,1563754228.0,"Same, I feel so much— I think it’s because, at least for myself, I feel bad for existing and always feel like I’m a burden on people so I pull away and isolate, which makes people concerned at times and I feel so bad for doing it — and therefore I distance myself more and ... well it’s a cyclical thing  

So while it might seem like I ‘dont care’ I just care so much - I think it gets misconstrued, because I also don’t know how to communicate this to anyone"

piercing,eqirz70,t1_eqiro3p,1560092652.0,Do you mind elaborating on the issues? If not don’t worry at all - hope I’m not being invasive. I had to take my nipple piercings out the first time I got them when I was a teenager because of issues- and have gotten them done again and they are fine but I think that’s some source of hesitance to get the vertical piercing

femalefashionadvice,eppcipw,t3_bvhzod,1559373576.0,"Tom Ford - more expensive, but I’ve had  a pair of glasses from them for over seven years - that I’ve gotten new lenses for over the years - whereas I have three pairs of Warby Parker glasses and I don’t know if I’m just clumsy but they only last me a good 6 months - 12 months before I start having issues.

Nowadays I tend to by glasses from Warby Parker if I know they are trendy, as in aviator metal frames, or clear frames... etc 
Whereas my everyday glasses these days - a black round pair - I always spend more money on

If you really like the glasses and just need new lenses and your Warby Parker one year coverage expired - lensable- (I think I’m spelling that correctly), changes glasses lenses if you send them in.
Hope this helps"

femalefashionadvice,epp3wh3,t3_bvghpk,1559362964.0,"So many sheer dresses, and most of them came with slips and I’ve bought them separately- but after having some for years, after dry cleaning, moving... etc — it’s crazy because I swear it’s always a struggle because it could be an inch to short or to long, or to sheer — idk it changes how things look a lot more then I like to think until I’m grabbing and pinching at fabric all day trying to ‘adjust’ the slip"
