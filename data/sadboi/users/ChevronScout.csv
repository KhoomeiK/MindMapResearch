depression,evr7f57,t3_ckmvf8,1564702746.0,"I too have had this problem. It's not so bad now (three years into counselling) but when I first started even trying to enter into conversation about anything would result in a complete brain freeze. Cotton wool I called it, felt smothered by it too.
Fortunately I found a way to work through it that suits me. Not trying to force anything through a session, not trying to remember everything, just picking one thing and turning it over. Divide and conquer. Took an absolute age but eventually things have started to get broken down."
