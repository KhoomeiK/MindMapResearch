Greysexuality,fi52mw6,t3_f6d7uj,1582153574.0,"No hate here. I‚Äôve been where you are. I‚Äôm 49, a female, was married for 8 1/2 years and have 2 adult children. My ex-husband actually called me ‚Äúfrigid‚Äù several times! That was before I came out as a lesbian (not saying that‚Äôs the case with you), and THAT was before I figured out I‚Äôm actually greysexual!!

So it‚Äôs interesting to me that you came to a place on the asexual spectrum for advice, as opposed to a marriage or r4r or even a women-oriented group... Do you identify as a greysexual?

Regardless, I have some thoughts...  

To begin with, it‚Äôs important to understand that there‚Äôs no ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù sex drive for females. Casting an evil eye at yourself only adds to the pressure to being sexual. Also, sex drives are a finicky thing. Everything from your menstrual cycle to how much stress you‚Äôre under at work can cause a change. (More on that in a minute!)

1. Are you on any medication that alters your sex drive?

2. How much stress are you dealing with? (Reduce it if possible!) What‚Äôs your sleep like? (Get enough hours with deep sleep and REM each night) Are you getting outdoors enough? (Sunlight and fresh air really does help, not to mention exercise).

3. I suggest trying acupuncture. There are studies that show it can increase your sex drive. It‚Äôs something you can do without the need to consult you doctor necessarily. 

Having said that, it‚Äôs possible that you may be dealing with something called ‚Äúhypoactive sexual desire disorder‚Äù (HSDD), now known as female sexual interest/arousal disorder. It can affect anyone, and it may be a sign of an underlying medical condition.

Common signs and symptoms of HSDD include:

* little to no interest in sexual activity
* rarely having sexual thoughts or fantasies
* disinterest in sexual activity
* lack of pleasure from sexual activity

My final thought is that you may simply want to be gentle with yourself and try some self acceptance. If you are somewhere on the asexual spectrum, know that you are not alone in that. Know that there is nothing wrong with being an Ace or a Grey. I understand that your husband may be all about the sex, so try to be open about where you are, how you feel, and EVER IMPORTANT (!!), what YOUR needs are, too!! If he truly loves you as much as it sounds like you love him, he will try to wrap his head and heart around it. Together, you can forge new ways to express your love for each other. Be creative!!

I hope you come to accept yourself, no matter where you fall sexually. Be gentle! It is absolutely possible to love and not have a sexual tryst to ‚Äúprove‚Äù it! 

Feel free to PM me if you‚Äôd like to talk in private. I‚Äôm no therapist or doctor, but I‚Äôm a good listener."
Greysexuality,fi3eph8,t1_fi3ehwf,1582114337.0,"Absolutely!! Ask away!! 

I remember when I found the term ‚Äúgreysexuality‚Äù!! It was an absolute epiphany!!! And the idea that there were others out there like me?! Incredible!! It was freeing, learning I am not ‚Äúfrigid‚Äù or sick in some way... Not ‚ÄúBroken‚Äù, as you said!! I‚Äôm glad you discovered the word, and our subreddit!!! Cheers!!"
Greysexuality,fi1vj4q,t3_f4egr9,1582065645.0,Well done!! You were very brave and explained it beautifully!
Greysexuality,fi1rojx,t3_f5y2ir,1582063436.0,"Hi! So I identify as a lesbian, but a greysexual. I have had serious long term (and sexual) relationships in my past. Like you, I rarely turn my head in a manner that feels ‚Äúinterested in pursuing a relationship with‚Äù any woman... I find the female form to be beautiful... but it doesn‚Äôt make me all jelly inside. 

But that‚Äôs just it! That‚Äôs the definition of a GREYsexual person! We aren‚Äôt e x a c t l y fully Asexual... but we certainly don‚Äôt fit an allosexual definition!! 

Having said that, I‚Äôd say that in light of the fact it‚Äôs been so many years, yes, you are a Grey, like me. That doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt want companionship... but more like platonic love, or amazing friendships with people. It doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt appreciate the human form... just not THAT way. 

More questions?? Ask away!! Or PM me if you wish to talk privately. Hugs from a stranger!
