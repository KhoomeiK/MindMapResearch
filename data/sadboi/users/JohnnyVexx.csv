My gf has never done any drugs and we can trust each other, I have a creative Job so money is NOT an issue, Sex is still good and if you can't get hard, viagra could help.
But the Problem is, I'm very jealous bc I don't have any self esteem, I mean a sober bf would be much easier for her to handle.
Anyways we love each other very much (I've had many disappointing relationships) so it can be done if you look out for
-money/ work
-physical health 
-mental health (I'm going to a psychiatrist)
I hope yall find love, live is hard enough..."

1) Gateway
2) Workstation

Then you could either build a 3.VM with Linux OS or Windows 10 and direct all traffic to the Whonix Gateway (Tor), then use Firefox browser and install a proxy plugin like FireX Proxy (you could also choose a proxy server from your actual country)
Or you could use the Whonix Workstation as usual with built in Tor browser"
