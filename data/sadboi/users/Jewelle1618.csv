cactus,fn810gv,t3_fxco2x,1586731659.0,"I was going to post a couple pictures for my sister. It looks like hers has this going on. Hers has a bunch of small bits at the bottom. She wants to know if those should be separated and replanted? Should the elongated parts be kept propped up? Also it seems to have a bit of scaly looking flesh. Should that be posted to one of the cactus medical subreddits? Should I also post on this subreddit to get an id for it, any care tips,etc?

stayathomemoms,fma82uz,t3_ftr0on,1585886261.0,"Your family, your rules. You don't need to feel bad. Even if you had chosen to have her over for different reasons it doesn't matter. It's your child not theirs. Our family members seem to feel entitled to our children some times. I tend to have my MIL over more because she is easier for me to be around than my own mother. That doesn't mean I'm chosing her over my mother. It just means that in my house I'm allowed to do what's best for me and my family. Being a SAHM is stressful on its own. Don't let their fussing add more to your plate."

AmItheAsshole,f76vwk8,t3_dufzum,1573437185.0,"The situation pretty much sucks to be put into. It sucks that someone was excluded due to a disability. I wouldn't have been as offended though if this happened to my son. He is autistic as well. I'm hoping that he will someday make it to this type of inclusion program, but I wouldn't be offended that someone didn't include him. There are major barriers,especially if he's only with the other children once a week, with him blending with the others. Sure it'd be great to get to have him be included and get some real world kid experience. I wouldn't want him to be forced to interact with a group of people who don't actively want him around though. It still sucks that it played out that way, but I'm not sure I'd blame them so much. It's a tough situation. Glad I'm not on your side of it."

It will make her feel that you trust her. Do not break her trust by using your key for non emergencies. She is young but this is a step towards building confidence and independence while still in a safe environment.
