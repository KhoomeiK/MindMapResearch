Gatineau,fkr81a3,t3_fk83w2,1584463638.0,Hello! We have created a similar group for those in Alymer : [facebook.com/groups/211083653487899/](https://facebook.com/groups/211083653487899/)
AskReddit,fe96ph6,t3_eo6kca,1578934872.0,"I was alone in a compartment on a commuter train, when a man came and sat right in front of me right as the train left the station. I immediately became uncomfortable, and I feel like he sensed that. He had the whole compartment and chose to sit directly in front of me, I knew something was going to happen but I didn't want to offend him in case it made it worse so I didn't move seats. I was reading a book before he sat down, so I was able to ignore him without being ""rude"". I then noticed out of the corner of my eye that he was masturbating. I got so scared. I honestly didn't know what to do, so I froze. He started speaking to me, but I was honestly so flustered I didn't make sense (this also helped that I was a foreigner, so my accent was different). I don't remember what he said because I just kept worrying it was going to escalate. I don't know why, but he then stopped and got up and went up to the compartment above. 

Nothing ultimately happened, but this event still causes me so much stress and anxiety to this day. This happened in France, specifically near Paris, where speaking from my own experiences it was terrible to be a lone female. This was not the only incident of sexual harrassment or molestation I experienced while there, but it was the most traumatizing.  I definitely got toughened up after living there, but I don't know if I would react any differently because I was so vulnerable. Anyways, I don't think I'm making much sense and am rambling now, but it is bringing up all those emotions again."

AskReddit,fcn78wk,t1_fcn6nfa,1577805097.0,"That is cool! Long arms are expensive, so it's cool that your local store has one people can rent out!"
AskReddit,fcn6gwb,t1_fcmy097,1577804524.0,"Buying more fabric won't get you a better deal unless you shop directly from a wholesaler, as local fabric stores sell by the yard/meter so you get the same price no matter how much you buy. Your best bet is to buy the fabric on sale at your local fabric store/online store. Sometimes the difference in price is the quality of fabric too, the fabric being organic, made from sustainable materials (Like Tencel or Lyocell), or [OEKO Tex Certified](https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/our-standards/standard-100-by-oeko-tex) . 

Alternatively, thrift stores can be great places to buy fabric, it's just a lot more hunting.

Sewing sometimes can be cheaper then making an item, but if it is a hobby, hobbies usually get away from you and you buy the items to have fun. That is what I tell myself everytime I walk into my fabric room. I have a friend who says that fabric buying and sewing are two separate hobbies, and that is definitely my reality."
AskReddit,fcn5az6,t1_fcmuc0c,1577803657.0,"You can totally do it!

They wanted a ban on Russia and all Russians. This goes beyond the scandal that most people are aware about through the documentary Icarus. When Russia was meant to prove their anti-doping agency was back on track after they were allowed to work again, they provided manipulated data to WADA. That's why people wanted a harsher punishment, they aren't taking this seriously. This punishment is basically what they had in Rio 2016."

I was in my last year of highschool when I started taking it, and I wish I took it sooner because I was able to graduate acne free which was huge for me. My acne didn't go away completely for me, unfortunately, but I had quite a few years of clear skin. It's not just the suicide thing that doctor's worry about, I had to go on birth control while on it (because it can cause birth deformities from what I recall), and had to take monthly blood tests to make sure everything was going normally.  

Highly recommend it for anyone in the same position!"

While that team was on their way to the airport heading home, one of their athletes forgot to load their luggage onto the bus. While on their way to their airport he called who he needed to call, and the local police got involved. Because there are so many security cameras around the city they were able to locate the athletes luggage right away, grab it and have it meet the team at the airport before they had to check in.
