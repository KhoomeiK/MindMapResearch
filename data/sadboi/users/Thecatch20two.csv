Anxiety,fpki7ya,t3_gdwcei,1588695156.0,"It‚Äôs crazy to open Reddit and see this thread at the top of my feed.

I‚Äôve been dealing with the exact sensory overload you talk about for the last year. 

I‚Äôve actually started wearing earplugs and sunglasses a lot more. Sometimes even when I‚Äôm just at home. Life has become so much louder lately.

Sucks..."
Anxiety,focx9ii,t3_feus7p,1587677086.0,"I am a 31 year old male, 6ft, 165lb lean and active, have no family history of hypertension and do not smoke- yet I always have high BP readings of like 150/90 and sometimes higher.

I have had EXTENSIVE cardiovascular testing surrounding hypertension. Stress Echos, Holter Monitors, Kidney Tests, Sleep Apnea tests and exhaustive blood panels. Everything has come back completely clean and healthy.

My problem is that I have actually gotten so paranoid of high blood pressure readings that the moment the cuff starts to inflate on my arm I have a panic attack and my BP shoots through the roof. This happens regardless of if It‚Äôs taken at a doctors office or at home. It‚Äôs a negative association that has been very hard to break. You can request a 24hr ambulatory machine from your doc that will measure intermittently throughout the day and I bet any money with that you will realize you probably aren‚Äôt really hypertensive... this machine will record your pressure while you sleep and your brains panic reaction is out of the equation. Unless you‚Äôve already done all these tests? 

For me my blood pressure issues and all my weird feelings throughout the day that I thought were form high BP were really just anxiety and panic ruining my life. I‚Äôve addressed those problems and my BP has normalized, go figure lol"
Anxiety,fnna0yc,t3_fq7ssl,1587087690.0,"I experienced the same exact situation about 8 months ago. 

I went for a run on a hot day with my friend, got back to the house (most likely a little dehydrated and hadn‚Äôt eaten in a few hours) and decided to smoke a dank joint with my friend. 

My heart rate went through the roof, it felt like my blood sugar dropped and I ended up on his kitchen floor for almost 6 hours feeling like I was having a stroke. 

This was the first time ever in my life that smoking tripped me up like this, and truthfully to this day- I‚Äôm still having days of bad panic attacks related to the sensations etched into my head from that shitty experience.

All I can say is... it truly is all in our heads. I actually had a ton of MRI‚Äôs, CT scans, Cardiology evaluations and blood work done after the event because I felt so much hypersensitivity and anxiety towards everything after that day. All tests came back perfectly clean and healthy.

For me I stopped smoking and drinking and am now focusing on getting the underlying cause of my problems addressed, which is a lifetime of anxiety and depression that I‚Äôve stuffed way down inside and weed (for whatever reason this particular time) highlighted...

Stay strong, DM me if you need to talk!"
Anxiety,fnn8nez,t3_fw5q9i,1587086827.0,"I agree!

For me, the day after I have a large panic attack I usually have a relatively enjoyable day. Baseline anxiety is there- but I feel like I drain my panic ‚Äútank‚Äù and can actually relax a little. 

Wish it didn‚Äôt take one day of feeling like I‚Äôm actually going to stop breathing from panic to get some rest though..."
