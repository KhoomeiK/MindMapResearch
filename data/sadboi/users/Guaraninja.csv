If you feel intimidated by talking about your feelings (it doesn't get any easier with age, you'll one day have to figure out hat works best for you), try speaking through your actions: hold her hand, give her a hug, give her a kiss.

Idk man If you've already talked about what would happen if either of you caught feelings, then you should go for it and make it happen for real.

I have to take transit to work when my roommates aren't at home, so I get the anxiety that comes with having to go through a crowd of people with the impression that everyday I go out, I might potentially catch something that could make my roommates sick, or give it to someone else I care about.

I also work with plenty of idiots who normally wouldn't be on my shift because all the smart individuals who I normally work with are staying home. Fuck, I hate being responsible for someone else's fuckups. Today for instance, I had to spend an extra 2 hours at work cleaning up after someone else's stupidity, when all i wanted to do was go home and drink with some friends online.

I at least I get to get out of the house, distress and breathe my own air when I'm on my way to the train station, but I just get nervous that I'll come home with something that could kill them. It's not something that will probably happen, but it's just something I think about when I wash my hands, or bump elbows instead of shaking hands with my coworkers. That it's more for their sake  than mine. 

It sucks that you're stuck in such a stressful situation with such a dickhead roommate, but I'd appreciate being able to stay inside without feeling guilty about doing something that needs to be done.

depression,fiog62d,t3_f8xhzl,1582582641.0,"Yes and no.
After high school, I didn't have top deal with as many social interactions (negative and positive) simply because I wasn't around as many people during the day.   I found that I was less lonely because I was being isolated by other people, but I felt more isolated because I wasn't putting any effort to interact withas many people.

I have to put an effort into letting people into my life and being a part of theirs, like a LOT more. It's not easy because: I feel like I let a lot of people down, that I'm being a burden, that I'm tired; but building these relationships, and making them stronger help me strengthen my emotional health. When I don't, I isolate myself and feel that crushing feeling of longing so much more than when I was in high school. 

There's still drama and cliques outside of school. Sometimes it feels worse because you expect people to grow out of these habits, but bullies will be a constant until they leave the old folks home in a Hurst, the silver lining is that there are more coping mechanisms available than when I was in school. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that there are some changes that you can do to make things better than high school, but you've got to work constantly to do so. Or at least I do, anyways. 

Hope you had a good weekend, dude. Take care this week.
