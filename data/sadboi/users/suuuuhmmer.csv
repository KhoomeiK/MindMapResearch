popheads,f8q9x2s,t3_e1jrwl,1574714391.0,"i've loved halsey since room 93. i thought badlands was so unique and incredible. it truly had a huge impact on my life and i have been obsessed with her since. hfk was....okay. i liked it for about a month and got sick of it. now or never was a promising lead single, definitely going for radio but still had a ""halsey"" edge so i was super excited. the rest of the album seemed...pandering for singles. with nightmare, i totally thought she was going back to her roots and no longer fishing for radio hits. but when it didn't perform well on the charts, i think she freaked out and changed direction. it's upsetting. she talked about h3 having a ""manson"" vibe and she seemed so committed to that, i even thought her getting marilyn manson tattooed on her was sign that she was all in on this edgy rock album. i really love graveyard and clementine really speaks to me as someone who is also bipolar. but i was so rooting for this edgy album.

sometimes i want to live in the timeline where ""closer"" never happened. i think the cultural impact of that song gave her a taste of mainstream pop and having a #1 hit and she's been chasing that ever since. when badlands came out, it debuted at #2 on the charts and had no radio singles except for new americana which only played on alternative stations (at least in my neck of the woods). she was so proud of that. but now she's really going for a radio friendly pop sound and it's clearly paying off - without me was hands down one of the biggest songs of the last year (and i'm a big fan of that one too). 

anyway, i could write a thesis about halsey lol but those are my thoughts. i still have high hopes for manic though."
