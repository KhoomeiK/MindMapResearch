CPTSD,fpurb9s,t3_gfkoul,1588921095.0,"TL;DR at the bottom but here's the whole vent:

I had a massive breakdown today. In that I had a redirected aggression  that lead me to yell at my boyfriend 2 times and a friend once really bad. I started to beat myself up eventually spiralled down really bad and hid in the closet because I was feeling and having suicidal thoughts. I slowly started to realize that since all my emotions are from the past that even a drop of them in the present overwhelms me. I told my boyfriend who came to give me cuddles that its fucked up because my problems comes from the past but I'm gaslighting myself by ridiculing and restricting my feelings in the present. I'm denying myself and restricting my feelings. I feel like I need a good cry but I have so much of that gaslighting haunting and it frightens me.

I thought i was so weak for falling for stupid things my parents told wm. My boyfriend told me that he believed a stupid story about how eggnog was made. Had a nice laugh. He has really started to help me the past 4-5 months and I am very thankful.

Reading this title helped as well because if I wasn't strong there was no way I could of held myself back against my overwhelming thoughts. 

I also learned while lightly high that since I believed that the feelings I had around my parents was what safe felt like I projected and made into exsistance those feelings around those i wanted to feel safe while I was really making myself afraid and scared by holding my breath and not allowing me to feel safe/comfortable/secure.

That's my problem not what others are doing its what I am doing to myself. It is on my parnets for teaching me but it's on me for continuing it or not. I decided on the latter and its painful.

I'm able to share more and be more clear and articulate in my speech and what happened to me. I was a very advanced kid when I was in elementary school and a lot of heartbreaking memories are being released.

My parents gaslighted me into not remembering that
when I was in preschool teachers wanted me to be pushed into the program that rushed kids to next level- elementary to middle to high. My parents used all the stereotypical excuses to get me out of it and it killed my interest in school because it wasn't taught at a speed I understood as I probably could of taken a high school or community college course in middle school. I was placed with teachers who most of the time didn't have teaching styles that did match with mine and I just sunk in a depressive stick never feeling good enough. 

My parnets didn't like how quick I was at learning things because how I could see through them so to them I was against them. It was very heartbreaking to watch. I have so much built up guilt for being as smart as I am. I want to utilize it so much. I was able to memorize books and even in my worst state I passed classes others fail without studying. This is my passive learning ability before any of this. I feel ashamed that I have failed so many classes because i shouldn't be able to pass classes effortlessly but I'm so intelligent I should have put more work in. Oh look, a very manipulative, cunning self fullfilling prophecy. ugh. More to do but I can see a pathway now and so much light has appeared. It's so appreciated.

This got lengthy.

TL;DR Abuse got worse then better. I have had more and more support from my boyfriend and loving it.  
Learning more everyday about how I am gaslighting myself and the insane extent my parnets gaslighted me- from a prodigy to a incompetent, traumatized mess (that's healing). I'm growing my ability to understand my emotions and understand that feelings cannot be forced they just happen and need to be accepted. It's rough but I am strong enough to climb the slope.

Edit: Simplified and Clarified."

raisedbyborderlines,fodm3uy,t3_g6ntz0,1587686391.0,"I just realized how much I use what my parents did to me as an excuse for why I do this. I got to respect that I just also realized I got taught it from my parents. That I am beating myself up for being a child since they are sponges but now it's my responsibility to get the paranoia I was taught out of my head. 

Not everyone is like my parents. No one is out to get me. Ridiculing, breaking a person mentally, and forcing them to subscribe to beliefs or religions they don't like isn't sustainable. That I do what they want above to prepare for the worse and it just fucks with my mind. Now I can see the crazy-making more after reading this and now don't feel like I created those problems that it literally came out of thin air and remember a lot of those conversations of ""but it's the way you would act!"" like they can predict the future. I have noticed I do it and it leads me to dissociate but damn is it hard to not do. 

I feel like I am bpd due to this. But realizing you have a problem is the first step dealing with underlying emotions is second, dealing with the abusive past is last. I need to deal with the emotions now about this.

Has helped, but also has hurt... I think that's a good thing though. It's better to realize you are shitty than go around with shit on your shoe that you think is everyone else. 

But to summarize my past my mom believed I was so severely autistic that me becoming the scapegoat was the only thing I was capable of becoming and my dad saw me as working at Vons when I am in my 40s. I never got diagnosed as autistic regardless of the many times they took me to see someone about it. They complained and bitched about wanting to get privileges and when the person bent they told me to tell them how I am autistic. I told once I wanted a voice recorder when I could use my phone but my parents always told me to tell others how I was autistic. This really messed me up and I honestly have a fear of developmentally disabled individuals or that everything I do is autistic and I belong in a group home."
raisedbyborderlines,flsz1l4,t3_fqhm58,1585454525.0,"Ugh I can feel this so much. There were so many reasons I didn't have friends growing up. I will name a few: I believed (or made) everything to be a crisis (as I grew up with my parents doing so), and I didn't want others to experience my parents. 

My mom claimed it was because I am just like her and she projected her feelings of something being wrong since I didn't not bring friends over. She used it then to claim and prove I have autism regardless of every professional saying ""no"". She would rely with, ""But you just have a special version."" Once when I was a junior or senior in high school I faced up to my mom and told her I didn't believe in it. She claimed that since I played on my own and scooted on my butt that I am autistic. I could continue on this route but just damn.

I will share one story about my after school program in elementary had a set schedule that rotated daily but have a core of activities stay the same. My mom would always pick me up right after going outside, while I was playing alone. Using that she always found me this way as a reason to berade me for always playing by myself since she always picked me up when I was playing by my own. She started telling me that her always finding me this way means no one wants to play with me so that proves that something is wrong with me. 

The people there were confused about what my mom was saying. I remember that one of them quit because they couldn't handle my mom. I do have faint memories of her intimidating or just her getting the kids of be scared of her which eventually me by extension. My sister told some others lies and a rumor mill started on had I made my mom do this. I was completely disgraced. If I tried to face up to this, my sister started saying that I am obviously lying after all I did do ""names some innocent random stupid things"" so of course my mom was right and I was wrong. 

After i was dragged home, they told me I deserved this because i had called cps on my family. They were cult worshiping (sacrificed live animals- didn't necessarily kill them. Told scripture of how suffering and mutilation was how things should be done and that is what everyone deserved) and hording (class 3 or 4 horder I forget). I was taken away from my sister, family and we were separated, but because of policy of keeping family together, I was given back to them because they are not hoarding, cult worshiping morons ""anymore"".

I'll probably come back to edit otherwise, sorry for the rushed information. I can understand my problems with a little clutter a lot better now as well as my other problems."

I believed that is what i deserved. I could dream and aspire but that was all it would be- I wouldn't attain anything. It wasn't that I couldn't it was my believe I deserved it and that I was still living as if i was in a crisis. This really helped me. I think it will let me actually move forward...


Now I fear I sound cheesy..... You only learn from others when you are ready to listen. I really needed to read this. Thanks for posting."
raisedbyborderlines,fkwy4hw,t3_fky887,1584611034.0,"I am wondering if that is why I talk to myself; I mean, other than that I was the only person I could talk to growing up. I had no trust in others so I wouldn't divulge anything. I knew my parents would do whatever it took to get whatever they wanted from me so I divulge what they wanted to hear.

To learn that I knew everything that was going on. Though, I don't know to what extent things happen the memories I have. I have horrid memories and new ones come into my mind the more I allow myself to feel. It's so freakish and causes me to have nightmares again. I don't sleep well and take too long. It's like the movies are being used as replacements for what's to hard for me to see as the way it was. Though I don't care if my memories are true- I want to free myself from the labyrinth of my own memories. I'm never going to forget but I can let go; if forgiving allows me to do that...

Then that is just the way things have to be. Is it easy,no. Is it fun,no. But by god is it relieving. I can focus and how much I can let go. I am just afraid how complacent and overwhelmed I am with all that I am learning.

I can only take care of myself right now. I cannot learn much outside because of how much I am learning inside. It's causing me to fall behind in school. I hate that. I want to succeed but I am not ready yet, I have more work to do.

I'm amazed how much I've changed in 5 years. In the start of this month I couldn't handle any frustration or loss; I couldn't handle any feelings. The year before that I just started to stand up for myself and that me being at fault or the problem doesn't mean that everything else would be right- I started to see how I was controlling everyone. It was a month ago I saw how I was controlling others by expecting what I wanted for myself. I didn't allow others to be themselves through ""this is what has to be done"".

I remember not allowing myself to relax then beating myself up with not complying with myself. I had so many self-fulling prophecies that I understand but is scrambling my brain. I've taught myself to focus on my breath when anxious or uncomfortable. I let myself focus on the part of me that is relaxed and let myself focus on that on top of the previous.

I'm not ready to go through my medical history. I am not ready to see if I have any psychological disabilities like my mom claimed I had and told me controlled my ability to do anything with.

I cannot handle it because I am too emotional about it. The amount of destress and how my anger has built up. 

It's so fucken painful. Learning to feel again is so painful.

I will never give up because this is who I am.

Thanks for reading. I hope this finds you well. This is my journey it may not be yours though use what might be useful. That's all I have."

If I understand correctly it was that I was telling myself things had to act/behave this way, due to parents or society conditioning (maybe my own expectation), when I had mostly no control over it- Like someone liking me. I was raised to believe I had to be responsible for what my parents or society told me I had because it was to be accepted into it. Yes in a way what to expect people to talk about in different points of intimacy (from stranger to intimate) is very important but the Achilles heel is the reason stereotypes have a bad name. That, yes, a lot of people may apply to them yet you cannot prove all of that category do. It's become a tale of adults vs children. Every has probably heard the adage kids should listen to their elders.

Taking in consideration vs blind acceptance. I think that's the lesson.

RBNLegalAdvice,fc59vpa,t3_eg8plr,1577450348.0,"There are a couple questions:

Have they started work on the new house? Is there standards of when something should be done by? Have there been plans being drawn up and have you been involved in them (proof of concept, sign of mutual respect). Dp you know any contractor or plot of land that has been purchased? If so, is it in writing and was a third person, like a contractor there for the writing as a witness to the aggreement?

Sounds to be that they are mooching off your hard earned work. He may be claiming it as his to show off but since he doesn't take the responsibility for what he does there its mete words- it isn't his. If he says something is his, he is responsible for what happens to it, i.e. he has to do maintenance and repair that area. You could say, By gifting it to you he still looks like a martyr while not having to maintain the area.

If he is being unreasonable, never get yourself in a position you cannot leave. Just go anywhere or do anything. If this is an issue you can talk about it when everyone is calmed down. Using 'I' statements helped me when dealing with my dad. I don't know how they would help you but it will stop the 'you stayements'.

I don't like it when people slam my door open because it frightens me. My dad stopped doing it. 


Another ones I would probably try if I had an minutia of interest in a relationship with my parents: I don't like being barred into my room it makes me feel like I don't have any responsibility for the spaces outside and I feel out of control. 
I don't like being confused during a conversation but I also don't like talking about the same topic for a long time. I would really like to write down what the problem is and how to resolve it. 

I don't want any more stress into my life and I don't want anymore in anyone else. 

I don't want to involve anyone into a problem I don't have any idea of solving. It upsets me and I end up yelling so I cannot face you, can I write it out instead and get an answer that way (written)?

 I don't like being yelled at; I feel small and slighted. I don't like yelling at others, I walk away to cool off; I perfer to talk when calm or using writing to tell what is wrong; I would like to talk about it but it upsets me too much to talk about it with you. I don't want to push stress on anyone else.

I have others but I hope I get my point across. It's taken me a long time to get here. KISS (keep it simple, stupid) by using 'I' and preventing pointing the finger (even if it is true). Will help you in the long run. If he can only see your actions ""force"" himself into complying by acting like it is your issues; it will potentially make him cope with his own shit.

I will potentially add more to this later but I wish you the best. I am not a legal professional but I am really interested in what has happened in what they came to you guys to do.

I don't remember any of it- I was in the fetal position and just remember overwhelming anger. Reasonable though.

He didn't like me using my right to walk away from his lectures, I guess. If I broke from his grip (stood in the door of my room), he would act like nothing happened- same with me walking away. Then make something else up that I did wrong because he cannot accept that he can do things wrong. 

Did that make me his handler?

Probably.

Also, both my parents are traumatized. Both display opposite sides to me than each other. That is what it meant to be in a codependent relationship,guess.

To put my mom in perspective

My mom was adamant that I was severely autistic. 
Backstory: I had a friend who is diagnosed as having aspergers. He has trouble with many different kinds of foods and very specific with things like not having extra space left over or empty space. I don't have anything characteristically autistic. Rocking back and forth can also be a sign of trauma in kids especially if the kid moves to other measures. No, my mom was adamant that I was autistic since I played by myself and scooted on my butt. That's it. Professionals never agreed with her but I was continously treated as such- was she replaying the dynamic of her and her parents? That is the only conclusion I can draw as it made her feel safe... eerie. She made any problem I had as a sign of autism which meant unchangeable. 

Now, I have a big problem with having difficulties or not understanding things. I am disabled in the way that having ignorant parents teach you 95% wrong way to do things makes you disabled. I can clean things and organize a house but I don't know how to take risks and fear failure to the point I failed out of community college because of it. ""But I am so afraid she cannot handle it because she's so autistic"". I can imagine her saying that to me when I was in elementary school. Also, ""But autistic kids cannot do that so don't dare show me up by doing that"". That was be interested in others. I loved hanging out and being around others. Therefore, I am a extrovert with a deep seated fear of people."

I think my worst is 5 but those I just have weird more than mentally scarring. EMDR self therapy video on youtube have helped as well as I am making strides using the self-love and acceptance subliminals.

Though in general, we don't need anymore negativity in our lives so i'll recommend the EMDR self therapy video (green light one I swear by). I still think you are steeping over bounds and need to learn some different emotional management techniques. Have you read the body keeps the score? Pendulation? A EMDR trick on closing your eyes and moving your eyes right to left helps you to dismiss your current though. 

 I'm a fan of self-therpy (cannot work because of daynightmares- I am seeing cracks but at least I know what is there now). Mainly unlinking my thinking and feelings have really helped lower the intensity of my reactions but takes considerable conscious effort.

Though regardless of what you do, it'll suck. But as long as you want and do work on it- you'll get better. (The major thing is believing that you can and creating positivity in your life like animals or friends, probably both. You cannot rebuild a shinking ship but you can jump to shore.)"

Something as simple as telling them conveys interest. I cannot expect them to assume when I am insanely good at pretending I am not.

I now understand what anticipating what others are going to say really means interpreting what they are saying through flashbacking. No wonder I have problems with relationships. There is no information other than what they just said and its freaky to me.

Too bad I was to fearful of everything growing up and if I learnt that..   I probably would be an engineer already. :( Though I know I needed the experiences and time to learn things on my own pace.

My favorite analogy is about how we each have our own time zone. Being ahead in their time zone doesn't matter. But if we compare yourself to each other we are acting like everyone is in the same time zone.

Not everyone in 3 years learned their parents are toxic, left their parents, realized they have toxic behaviors and is learning how to process their emotions which led to their toxic behaviors. That most of my toxic behaviors are maladaptive coping mechanisms. The rest is just unprocessed emotions/trauma.

Worst things was learning that what my parents called a personality trait are mainly a collection of my adaptions to trauma. And that by comparing myself to people was changing the flags just like how my parents did with school by allowing my sister to stay home after not doing her homework. I was and sometimes still am moving the flags. I only realized it like a week ago and the thought is freaking me out. That's understandable. Its freaky how much I understand and how rational my reactions are even emotional.

""Oh you are just too emotional"" No, I am just insanely emotionally immature. If I learned to wait and just let it be until I was okay with it then let it go... i wouldn't of had any problem with my feelings.

Wait, could dissociation be released like that? I realize something new everyday.

One person talked about greyrocking and it's very useful. I found about it after moving out. You can find information about it on out of the fog. You can use b-ok.cc to find books since you talked about being broke. You can use it to gain skills or ability to cope with your parents. There are books like complex ptsd and my personal favorite the self-therapy series. 

Get out, get busy. See what the requirements to get a job weither it is parents (sigh) or GPA. Aim for that. Feel your resistance, guilt, shame and what ever else. It will suck. It will be painful. Prepare for all that to happen. It sucks. 

'It's part of the culture'. They think it makes you strong. It doesn't.

I would try meditation but it can be scary since it made me realize that my family is a shitstorm before I could leave. It helped a lot with my emotional baggage.

Not sure how bad the teacher are there (read some information about how they have donephysical and psychological abuse just...shit). You might have to learn things on your own (online resources). CLEP is accepted so if you cannot do AP/IB (or whatever they call secondary school classes), or don't want to, you can tell your parents by studying for the CLEP test you can get ahead in college and save money (is money for the test but less than college class). Can use a library to get away. Khan academy, and maybe try getting classes at a college (if possible).

I know it's a lot, sorry. It's probably all over the place.

I had an after school program to go to and helped me to stay sane. Of course you know, just focus if it's all overwhelming on get finances to get out everything else will fall into place because of that.

Lastly, be proud you can see and understand this. Not everyone can accept this happening so you must be strong to be capable of accepting it.

Being sensitive saved my life.

My parents found my boyfriends parents, my boyfriend told his father the things my parents have done and just like the strip episode with my dad I am learning that my spectrums of feelings or sensitivity is right and it was shitty things for them to do. My boyfriends father said that he would bring a gun to the door next time due to what they have done. 

Other peoples reaction has helped me understand what boundaries are. How intimate sharing thoughts and emotions is. It is why I feel overwhelmed in social situations because I give too much away. I thought it was to be expected.

I thought to be friends with someone I had to turn into them- that's the only way to be accepted. I ran away from my feelings because I needed to change them. I was afraid of feelings because of the stories it would tell. Because it would tell me I didn't have to do that instead it was coercion. Emotional coercion.

I don't know if this would help but I found a place you can get books for free.... you can also find free workbooks and books on ptsd. Personally and as a lot of other people have said the body keeps the score I recommend  and I found it on this website. B-ok.cc is its name. 

I can totally relate to the pain. I just face it everyday. I hate that I feel that pain and understand it's in the past but that's not enough. Have you thought about massage therapy?

In the book body tells the score it indicated how how tense and uptight one of his patient was he recommended to her that she see a massage therapist. In it the patient was sat down, closed her eyes while the therapist gently put her hands on the patients feet. The patent yelled ""Where did you go?"" Eventhough she was there, the patient couldn't feel the person's hands on their feet. It was replicated by the psychologist and it showcases depersonalization.

T he chapter before showcased how in a mri only a little of one of the features of the brain lit up just a little while in un traumatized individuals 4 (or 5) parts light up. It showcases how depersonalization happen since those parts or the brain are necessary for self identity and awareness. This experiment happened when they were asked to empty their mind. That is only one chapter of the body keeps the score.

Massage therapy is one thing you can try as well as.... here's an article about it: https://www.acesconnection.com/blog/therapeutic-tremoring-shake-off-stress-and-trauma.

It talk about how if an animal even dogs and cats when they experience something threatening in safety the literally shake once and they are back in the present time but due to our social norms we stop doing this even though it's our bodies way of shaking off stress. It's more explained in the article.

Other options include EMDR, somatic experiencing. Since you cannot get your hands of MDMA, have you tried mushrooms or high CBD weed (personally, a little thc helps with nightmares).

Have you thought of online therapy as an alternative? It is like 150-200 dollars a month.... at least that is the price I saw from better help. I haven't tried them yet though.

I have just let my body tremble (as animals) and it has calmed me down a lot and the tense feeling is a lot dissipated. If you try the tremoring (you can find a video on youtube, I think.) I would recommend telling your parents about it so they don't freak out. I know it sounds weird.... but it has helped me so it may help you as well.

Hope you can find help in this composition of ideas I have but together here. Hope for the best for you! Hope you can feel better soon.... so that is what it's like to feel my feet...

CPTSD,eyuiegn,t3_cynq1x,1567462975.0,"My parents did something similar but could only fine someone who said maybe. They also went through a brain scan that proves aspergers with like a 98% efficiency it was clear.... I didn't have aspergers. My mom was still using that person's maybe and to make matters worse it was from someone not qualified in autism.

I went to a DSPS counselor to find out if there was any grounds and all there is on my middle school record is mention of a iep. Not why or what reason.

It reminds me of when I started college and my mom was so offended that she could of gotten reprieves and treated me special because the iep moves stays with me. She yelled at me for not telling her about it when I had no clue. No matter what I said, I was at fault.

The year before they tried to take me to a place to help with my high functioning difficulties. A few minutes after being with me the CEO said that we are not a good fit but would be willing, if it would help me to write me up for autism. My dad told me to tell him...... I remember being appalled and froze. That person was the first person to talk to me like an adult rather than severely autistic. It was a breath of fresh air.

A year afterwards I faced my mom to that since I didn't act anything like my friend who is diagnosed with aspergers meant that I didn't have aspergers. My mom verbally attacked me and said that just because I don't act like him doesn't mean I don't have it, it just manifests different. As well as saying, ""this proves that you have severe autism not aspergers"". 

She verbally attacked me before for liking someone 4 years older than me. Two days later she wondered why I wasn't sharing my emotions with her.

I don't know which of my parents are worse.... 

I have recently learned that being more friendly with strangers than your parents is anti-autism. I knew I could be myself around others rather than my parents because my parents never felt right. I have really toxic behaviors from my parents and project my feelings onto others because I was never allowed to have my own. I had a hard time distinguishing between my false self and me. What its reactions ate and what projections from the past. I had instant shame reactions to everything I think or do. I should do this.... is a very toxic thing for me. It causes me a lot of pain and one of the main reasons my body and mind have a hard time being there, because I needed to be fake to survive.

Learning that messing up, yelling in someone's face doesn't make someone lash out. I still have hard time saying what I want. How can he not see me, he's right across from me while he had his noise cancelling headphones. I forgot they were that good in my distress...  it makes me fear I am just repeating the cycle and makes me freeze
...

I am getting off topic here. I can relate to whole autism thing and it has really negatively impacted my development. Almost everything was because of my autism and i shouldn't be able to do that because of autism but I should know how to do that because my parents know how to

.... I should automatically know, If i don't ""look how autistic you are!"".

 What am I incapable of doing next? Because they destroyed everything I loved with ""but your autistic!"". 

They even forced me to read a book i.e. wouldn't pay attention to me unless I was reading that book, would ask me where my favorite book is, if I was confused and finally got it after awhile yell at me for taking so long then ask me if it wasn't my favorite why did I read it a lot. ""Because you pay attention"" responding with, they didn't know what I was talking about how could they tell if I was reading a certain book. I said, by looking at it..  lastly, who was I to tell them what they can and cannot look at...(confirmed my point) . One of the earliest circular conversations that I remember. This was probably back in pre-k to like 1st grade.

Lastly, my mom used that I could play by myself and i scooted on my butt as signs of autism. No other reasons. Just those. Also vacillates between being proud of me scooting and using it as proof I am autistic. I am not sure. She hated I didn't like playing with her. Even if the after school program told my mom I play alone as well as with others. ""But I always find her this way; there is something wrong with her!"".

My mom didn't believe I did actions or things away from her.

Have you done job fairs or reached out to someone in your profession and ask how they got their job?

You can do career counseling but first reach out to acquaintances and know what you are looking for. Pay rage.... hours worked.... when you work best.... how you play with others.... where your problem areas are as well as what you do better than others (you can easily be oblivious to the last point); in cause of supervision, do you perfer hands off, the middle or for it to be structured? Do you enjoy focusing on solving coding problems (scrutinizing it) or creating the code? What about how the code looks on the page to you as well as others who don't know code? Is it simple or seem all over but make logical sense? Do you care how your product appears to end user or would you rather that be someone else's role? This can all help nail down a specific role you can be to help support or otherwise bring profit to a company.

If you have to plan someone to appear and have to plan for when they don't something isn't right but no, if i do as my mom told me my dad doesn't get off the fact i agreed with him once.

Even when i tried getting help years ago via my nparents insurance there was a 6 month waiting list to get seen. I am in California so idk what to do. 

After that i have recognized:
I'm trauma bonded with pain and suffering. If i am not experiencing it i feel shame or guilt. I feel i did something wrong to not get what i deserve. This is what i know needed to be overcome though i have no idea how to do so. 

The problem other than my past therapy experience is that i think i am doing too much. I am overwhelmed and don't know how to deal with it. From letting myself believe in my past memories-i know everything about it and can feel the experiences..... i cannot deny them though denying them is probably why i feel like i am not myself. I am starting to understand what interests me, what i enjoy and that i am starving for knowledge. I also have come to know that i can sooth the loneliness and pain in my heart by understanding it all. I don't need to accept it yet. I may in time come to understand more. This was probably distorted by my dad's implications of ""understanding"" meaning agree saying but that is just how things are.

Separating what my parents told me via what i actually believe seems to have helped a lot. I feel my personality is starting to emerge. It feels very familiar and relaxing. Oh speaking of relaxing, i have been able to start letting my guard down. Its fun and soothing.

The boiling feeling wanting to emerge validates the past i am so fervently trying to deny. It's terrifying to younger me so i avoid it. I remember that i can let younger me off the hook and give adult me the burden instead. I will ask her to let me protect her, i know she deserves it. 

Damn i feel my words are of a ill person. At the same time it feels like that just means they are true.

I understand its the effect on others but right now its  affect on myself. 

Changing anything about myself just feels so selfish like how my parents were ashamed and ridiculed me for have been capable of change. Utalizing that as a reason to demonize me that since i was the only onr who could change that i was the abnormality. There was something wrong with me.

I remember reading personality types about how certain types like feelers are much more likely to be people pleasers and it's very lame to enable your behavior as a result of a test. Its not about people pleasing- its about emotional intelligence. Learn how to get what you want without doing people pleasing. The whole idea of you teach other how to treat you is true though we have a monkey wrench thrown in since your parents are supposed to teach you how you deserve to be treated and with the commonality of verbal and emotional abuse most people probably don't get that. 

Its so damn screwy."

If you don't know its there, it stays there until you do. Its so clear now. It also hurts so much. I have never been as full with rage. I am vengeful out of sadness and despair. My helplessness and hopelessness was all about the situation and not me. My parents couldn't stand me being more successful than them so they ended up damaging my desire or interest in taking time in what i am studying. I am vehemently afraid of studying and its painful when i do what i enjoy. I am so saddened i tore myself up over things that i hold no responsibility of.

It hurts my brain."
NarcissisticAbuse,et1jbmz,t1_eszinlj,1562398286.0,"Omg that is both my parents. Ugh. This post has been eye opening. 

This happened once when my mom went off on me about liking a guy 4 years older than me. 2 days later she asked why i haven't confined in her since then. I got away as quickly as i could. Ugh.

This is what happens when i tell my dad to give something back he told me i would get back. He rarely even held up his end of the bargain. If i asked too much he would throw my ds and phone at me claiming i love my technology more than him. All i was doing was holding my dad to his word and he flips or claims i am making things up or that me bringing it up shows that i don't deserve those things he took away but also that he doesn't remember everything so, he shouldn't be given responsibility for the things he has said but doesn't remember saying.

I am honestly considering my dad has DID, because of all the different versions of him. My mom was very more consistent than my dad so, it makes sense.

I am just so frustrated how i feel for their tricks! I know i didn't know and i shouldn't of had. I am just so angry they are that way and there was nothing i could of done, nothing i could of done differently and that just hurts massively.

I wasn't nothing. I wasn't able to change or do anything to improve a situation my parents impose on themselves each day. It was my responsibility to get out and deal with the damage they have done but now i have responsibility for. I will get over this.

Thinking outloud lol"
NarcissisticAbuse,esfah5t,t1_esdcgnc,1561921175.0,"So, it is okay if it hurts. I thought there was something wrong with me since i feel so much anguish. (proud of myself for labeling this emotion... it's alluded me for all this time)

Narcissists cannot stand how good i am with making arguments. I got punched in the face by one and minimized and belittled by another, my dad (word salad rs). My mom undermined my credibility by labeling me as autistic when no psychologist has even told her yes. It's so insane.

There is not enough fingers on my hand to show how much i wish i was wrong, that i was as fault. That very though shows how narcissistic my parents were. I feel worthless without them and that i cannot survive without them.  I now realize how close i was to actually taking my own life a little over 2 years ago. It's heart breaking. I am more and more amazed at what i did to survive. I subscribed to the things they told me I enjoyed causing me a lot of anxiety as well as saying the things i enjoy i don't.
By saying, ""How sad, you don't even understand what you enjoy.""

Why do I have to write down everything for you? When i asked my mom or dad to create a calendar or list detailing my chores. ""I've already told you so many time. Why do i have to put so much effort in?"" Meaning, i wouldn't be able to tack on random punishments if i give you a list of things to do. How dare you ask me to be consistent. I always felt that spelling things out (wnat you expect, stand for, etc) and telling people to their face was always wrong (confrontation and working out problems/see id we can work better together) unless you find the magical way to word it right. That makes me chuckle. It just showcase my parents self centered by not creating structure for me or my sister. 

My judgement has been correct. It feels great but also fearful that my validation and support will be taken away from me like my parents did by using my sister to undermine my credibility. I was alienated and no one believed me. It was so traumatizing. Even the way i act was all so they wouldn't go after me. It hurts. So much. Though, i am too fearful to take this mask off. Fake happiness. It makes me feel like i am fake all the time, so i need to. These feelings i have always had so it is very strong as i was numbing them.

So, i need to change. In order to change, i need to embrace myself. What i am and what i was just told i was. I keep shaking and i am afraid i am just making those around me scared for me. Even though its a technique to release past trauma- to just shake. Thanks for those who read my post.

It may also help to read books on the effect of trauma to understand your bodies reactions to what you expeirenced. I have read a decent variety and there is a lot more out there.

I would recommend starting with Invisible heroes Survivors of trauma and how they heal. I'm on chapter 5 the physical effects of trauma is very hard to read because of my programmed response of ""i'm making it out to be worse than i am"" or ""it's all in my head"" 

I hate it. I don't want anyone to go through it but i cannot control it so all i can do is help other prevent this from recurring. Also pete walkers website might help but it is intense so this is a warning. As well as Guided imagery/meditation has helped.

INTP,es5qpu0,t3_c5tu42,1561623398.0,"I don't know if anyone has recommended these things.

I have been on a self discovery for a little over 2 years now. I come from a really toxic upbringing. My dad smiled when i gave up trying to push pass him as he would block me from escaping from one of his narcissistic feedings. Him blocking subsequently smiling when he did, broke me and i read recently, years afterward (like 4-5), of how broken i was since i crawled into the fetal position in the farthest corner of my bed after he preventing me from leaving an unbearable/unhealthy situation.

And that is only one experience. Since then, I have studied abuse and how it can contort someone personality. There are some things i recommend. Meditations guided as well as guided imagery. I also recommen pete walkers website (flasback management) if you can relate or connect to what he explains, i woukd recommend his book. 

Though before that book i would recommend invisible heroes survivors of trauma and how they heal. It has helped me understand why i have the responses i have, why i cannot remember everything or even what happened; my symptoms as well as addressing my confusion on if i have trauma or not. You may already be past this point but it helps most with those who are having trouble communicating what they experienced or felt.

Have both books lets me connect the ideas together. It is very much interrelated though the cptsd book is more intense and very intimidating. I would still take the invisible heroes slowly since the validation it brings can be shocking as it was to me. Both have been indispensable. I have also read and been helped by: Adult children of emotionally immature parents by Linsay C. Gibson, PsyD; as well as Emotionally Absent Mother by Jasmin Lee Cori, MS LPC. The latter more than the former. 

Wish you the best."
toxicparents,es3dcjg,t3_c5jwwe,1561559908.0,">Are you ready to talk to me like a normal human being? Like an adult?

My dad would do this all the time in any conversation. I usually would drown out what he was saying because most of it was nonsense. I know he was fishing for a response. I have memories of him telling me to talk louder since he couldn't hear leading me to raise my voice then indicate that his abuse was necessary because i was raising my voice as well. 

I felt demeaned and minimized that even when i tried talking to them they were so dismissive of what i said, cherry picking things to prove that i was trying to intimidate or threaten them. I was so ashamed of my parents behavior. 

I found myself both jealous and glad i wasn't my sister as she was given almost everything she wanted. Only when she broke items and they couldn't return the item by saying she dropped it by accident rather than threw it down. She also kicked the wall near the stairs when she didn't get her way. I am so glad i didn't get raised to be as entitled as she was though she said i had it so much easier. She was abused by getting her way to much and given as much money as she wanted and i was raised the opposite as in i was for fault for everything including not being friends with everyone means i am unfriendly. No one wins. I knew that instinctly. The fact she told me i had it easier means she is incapable or cannot see what i am easily capable of. Lack of empathy? She was rarely around when my dad would terrorize me. So that is majority a factor.

Regardless, I am NC with my parents. When i told them i didn't want to hear from then again they showed up in my place of residence four times before cutting ties. Even more desperate attempts than the last. When my roomate told them dispassionately to respect what i wanted they monologue about how wronged they are for me distancing myself in that way. They even had the gull to bring someone who had nothing to do with this yet continued to refer to my parents as great people throughout the conversation i had. 

This is known in narcissists as flying monkeys. It took him 6 times of repeating the same conversation (30 minutes to 1 hr) before i got angry about him not taking heed about leaving. He thought that he won when i got angry. I just hit an impasse. I was nice, now i will be dismissive. He seemed startled and confused of how i got angry but wasn't submissive. He backpedaled faster than i could of said goodbye and mimicked my language I had. Said he was third party. I wanted to laugh. Using things he did that shouldn't be seen as signs he's a good person or trustworthy- that he doesn't call his step son/daughter step son/daughter. I was dismayed by what he was putting down. It was distressing and should of just shut the door. His mind games were a bore. 

These experience including those not mentioned (I haven't seen my daughter in 3 months i deserve this! -my dad), cemented my nc. It could be used as a test. I just wanted some space, they didn't like the fact i was living on my own. Add a guy in and it made it unbearable for them. ""I was just leeching off him, since he has money."" I worry that i am taking advantage of him daily but tell him if i am occasionally. I am ashamed about relying on another individual that isn't myself.

I'll sidestep this and in a comment i heard you are working and i find that amazing. I have something that might help. Stay out and away as long as you can. Start doing more things like volunteering that give you an excuse to stay out. Being at home at lot was the reason i was more abused than my sister. Also, that i had a 5 p.m. curfew as a college student. I also was woken up by my dad when i didn't get up and it was my fault for staying up ""past my bedtime"" of 9 p.m. I was so shocked since the only time i felt secure was when my dad was asleep. That was when i studied, did my homework and was the only reason i passed my classes. I got to class everyday when there was only one bus route and one time to get me there. That didn't prove to my parents i could manage my own time or be capable of determining when i sleep and when i get up. 

In the end, I agree as a another poster in that going NC was the best thing for me. The start of that was my mom appearance of love when i taken to the er and the subsequent denial of my exsistance when i got home. I didn't see my parents for weeks until my bruise healed. Then abused for not reminding them to sign a document they had inntheir control for a refund of the ambulance ride. That experience shattered their stranglehold on me and i started to look to others to escape eventually leading me into the situation i now have. It's been 2 years away and 5 months of it being nc."

I can totally relate to this. I have been stuck until now with thinking that i should be with my parents because they need me (to be their scapegoat). I deserve to have people around me that don't treat me that way. I was filled with shame about it and overcome it when i thought: I don't want that, it hurts. Since they hurt me they don't deserve in my life. I cried and now i don't feel ashamed about that.

I used to just fall asleep. I am thrilled i didn't this time. I really hate it when i get overwhlemed with my memories i fall asleep, but i know sometimes i couldn't handle it and that is okay. I will overcome that eventually. I think it helped that i learned that i am not so much different than i think others are. They have insecurities and anxious and think that what they said was stupid. That they can obsess over things they did or said, worry about it all. It was my parents denial that was the problem, not me. Their abuse wasn't about me. It's about them recreating their abuse because they still want to fix it or because their so deluded and gone they actually believe it. Regardless, i don't need them to influence me anymore and it reduces my fear of the future. It seems like it could be seen as thrilling... and leads me to cry.

I believe i can finally leave them and their chaos as their responsibility not mine. I can start to blame them for their actions because i did nothing to deserve it.

Crying seems to help immensely with my regret, shame and toxic blame. Due to this and because of where i am at in my recovery, i was able to get to this point and glean a lot from this. I didn't lose anything. They lost everything and that has nothing to me. I don't deserve to be a scapegoat. I deserve more. I want more and i want to change. I hate how i hate myself. I hate how toxic i act to myself. I am not responsible for my parents actions and even my natural greyrocking wasn't enough to protect me. They took everything and it hurts. I wished they could of been someone different but they cannot. It's harmful for me to hold onto hope.

I no longer feel ashamed from escaping my parents. I shouldn't need to be someone's scapegoat for them to want me to be around them. I shouldn't need to go home for them and not myself. I need to take care of myself first so that means not having parents in my life.

I'm okay with never being able to forgive them ever. Though, i don't think this has breaked through emotionally yet. 

I understand the problem with therapy and how expensive it is. This is why i haven't done it. Tried it at my school and didn't seem to help. Focused on the tension in my muscle rather than my lack of security even though she can relate to me seems to me she didn't know how to help me feel safe which my DSPS counselor was capable of. It's scary and weird. She pushed me to go into mental health as well. I felt like that was overstepping boundaries. I stopped seeing her. I will try mesa next semester. 

I am ashamed of my academic history (atrocious) but it was slathered with a shit load of abuse. I think i am able to handle school with the focus on healing that i have done.

My parents knew where I lived so even after that they showed up and even tried to buy me back with presents like my weighted blanket. i still look at it as a bargeting chip but I use it to spite them and why not it's a nice blanket.

I now will shut the door in his face if he ever shows up again but then I asked in the best possible way to go the hell away. He stayed for like 30 minutes to an hour until I got angry as if he won me over when I am angry. NO, the opposite of what he expected happened and he backpedaled really fast. I looked at him like I looked at my dad when he is avoiding the question or bringing up irrelevant points. HE normally says, Stop looking at me that way.

Also, if you are so deserving of dying why did you respond to me anyway, you didn't even need to respond. I just saw you warp reality. It's very dismissive. In any amount of darkness there is that amount of light. It boils down to your choices.. my parents chose the actions they did, so they are responsible for what they did. My dad did whatever he could to not make him responsible and felt nothing from the action other than a snarky smile showing that he got what he wanted. He enjoys people in pain and pushing responsibilities on others. That is the only way he can function.

I will not accept any other reality other than my own. yes, we may have our own perspectives.

My mom's enabling and otherwise malfunctioning android behavior.
my dad's bipolar: i completely forget i abuse you and wonder why you don't have a job because i made you believe you were incapable of finding people that could relate to you that aren't weird. I will totally forget how i just hazed you since i cannot handle that my hockey/football team lost so i am going to take it out on you not your sister for her obvious lack of cleaning her room but your lack since you have a plate of just finished food on your bed and omg a piece of lint on the foor. 

Somehow me having those things will result in me being shamed and blammed for everythjng that happened in his past that made him not get his way. Then he will turn around and give advice not needed or even if needed would dismiss me as a angsty kid or that this proves i am being disrespectful without asking if i had anymore questions with a i am better than you attitude while doing it.

My favorite memory is the one when my dad drove my mom under the bus with a tone that i would need to help my mom achieve what she wants to achieve. I mean....damn. Then i tried to explain to them about how i wanted a break off school and my mom malfunctioning as usual told me that ""i can handle half time right"" and my dad said the same thing. I can that doesn't mean i should but i didn't dare say that. I can... ""so do"" my mom interjected. Whelp. Also i explained how i didn't want a car because it is too expensive and not worth the costs thay rooming somewhere else with a roommate and taking the bus would be cheaper. My dad gave me homework about the expenses involved in teaching me how to drive and everything i told him i didn't want...  like rip, he didn't hear anything i said.

I did acted like i may come back stating those things sounded like a good idea but also that i can do those thing coming by occasionally. I was just astonished about how desperate they told me i needed to come home. Very sad actually that they cannot face themselves and need a scapegoat.

I will not be that scapegoat. Also my mom scapegoated the cat sometimes. I thought she was joking at the time but now i remember the look on her face...  she wasn't.

It creeps me out.

These things happened about half a year to a year ago. I don't keep track of time because i don't need to keep track of shit...  doesn't help that my mind still expects them to happen. I am worried i am going through a cycle of valuing/devaluing other then i recognize that their grayness is just changing. Its a big oh.... moment. I am no longer thinking of other in black and white, it brings relief."
CPTSD,epj533k,t3_butag8,1559247480.0,"Wow this is insanely impressive. I couldn't go an hour without doing anything negative to myself. Self-depricating habit is hard to break. I believe we all i can do it but it's impressive. I hope you continue on doing this. 

We can do this.

Cannot wait to see your tenacity with a 30 day post. That would be ridiculous. A week is a great goal then 2 then a month. Sounds insane. One hour is still mine. 

Cannot wait to see how you progress."
survivorsofabuse,eox0chl,t3_bte0hn,1558917333.0,I can relate to the make love part.... i cannot stand me most of the time so i do with the stress relief.... i don't like having anyone that close to me.
raisedbyborderlines,eou0nq1,t1_eott3bt,1558853541.0,"Ugh. I had this then i would be pushed towards nonskimpy clothes but don't dare deny your moms appreciation by not at least trying on the clothes she finds for you... she's only doing her best. 

We always went clothes shopping at least once a month and it sucked. Mountain climbing gear, workout equipment, boxing set practically everything i really wanted i could of gotten instead of all the times my mom took me out for even more clothes. It's like its her obsession. I don't  get it. I don't need shoes every few months and when even a little wear starts showing they ask if i need new anything. Then complain about how much money they spend on clothes for us. How we're so unreliable and ungrateful for the lengths they go for us even when they have years of supplies of things deodorant, hair products, etc they would get/give more. 
Like my mom would pop in to give me samples i don't want or another body product and I was offended by the unnecessary use of money.... yet the response she gave me when i asked her for anything else was but why didn't you like the gift i gave you? You should like the gift because i know everything about you, then she acted like i should be renowing her for her waste of money. That i should sit in a location and accept everything as if a god gifted it to me. That I should be gracious i came over their mind in addition to being moved enough to get me to get anything.

This stuff just frustrates me and fundamentally makes no flippin sense. I now can completely understand why i believed i was crazy because I cannot undedstand how someone could believe what my parents do.

I find myself obsessively shaking my head."
raisedbyborderlines,eotx7ey,t3_bsw557,1558851121.0,"I am very loud. I am not sure because of all the times my dad would tell me i am being to quiet so i'll raise my voice he will continue this until i was yelling even if the whole time he was he would tell me this proved i was a narcissist and not to be trusted because look at all the attention i wanted to take. I am starting to understand the crazy thing i remember...  it's sadly, most likely accurate. 

Also i probably have both cptsd and ptsd. Ptsd from one event that is district and different from everything- the starting of an engine-while cptsd is the gas because of how chronic and constant it was.... like they always had the gas on and wondered why they weren't getting anywhere increasing the pressure on me to change in order to imporove their situation.

I can completely understand why i was so confused and lost in the stuff i tried to understand but couldn't. Emotional pain, incapability due to age, and how they dove, tearing clawing ripping apart like a wild animal unleashed and i killed all its relatives while it helpless. That insane. Like my exsistance or look offed people. They would get offended looking at me or claim when i was sighing i was angry rather than frustrated or that i had to be angry. It's futile to explain, that would cement his view but also silence. So either way- fucked.

I feel like i am breaking... that i may turn into a malfunctioning android unable to achieve my purpose....

I'm supremely confused, bewildered and just
.... there was close to no reason for any of it. I hate it because i hate when people avoid personal responsibility. They were god-kings of their craft. It was almost poetic."
