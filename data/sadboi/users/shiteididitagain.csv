Expressing something you wish for or want isn't bad. What's manipulative is trying to guilt him into it, force him into it or try to implicitly or covertly lead him to that decision.

It's not weird or stupid to be upset about this, please don't feel ashamed or guilty. And him getting defensive and pretending that you don't know what you're talking about is suspicious and not okay, it seems quite deceitful. That's him not owning up to his actions nor taking responsibility, and you really deserve someone who does those things, especially given how much thought and effort you're putting into it (and that's great! Keep that healthy thinking up and kick BPDs ass! üòâ)

BPD,fli3gil,t3_foshax,1585174588.0,"Plenty of other responses here were good and covered a lot, but in my experience, it can be a question of seeking out abusive relationships. Meaning, the ""broken"" part of you (inflicted from past traumas) means you have a hard time understanding and/or appreciating a healthy loving relationship. Meaning you'd rather seek out a hurtful relationship, one where you're left hanging, where you aren't loved, maybe even abused, cheated on etc... I know for my part that I was really scared of that, in the sense that the lack of trauma and pain would bore me or such... thankfully the sane SO I have now changed my perception enough to truly enjoy a healthy relationship, but before that, I couldn't stand the actual notion of a healthy relationship. It could also be because you deep down don't feel like you can genuinely be loved. Self-hatred is an insidious thing that can sabotage many things.

Half of that has been helped by being very upfront. My SO knows about my BPD and anxiety/paranoia/abandonment issues. So our agreement is that whenever I get bad thoughts, I do my best to stay calm, and simply present the facts (not getting angry, sad, passive aggressive) ""Hey I'm having thoughts about this..."" or eventually simply ask who the person is. It might be somewhat invasive, but he understands and calmly explains it.

MurderedByWords,fjo1egt,t1_fjnrh79,1583518560.0,"You make very good points that are very much true. Awareness of one's issues and willingness to work on it (and actually doing it) makes the whole difference, that's a rule that can be applied very generally. I know from first hand experience how traumatizing it is to deal with someone who has BPDs fullblown symptoms, and 0 self awareness, I've been in therapy the last 7 years thanks to growing up with that. Yes, there are people with that who are absolutely toxic, but the comment made it sound like one inherently is toxic and destroys people's lives because one has that diagnosis, and that is just not true.

And I am also a huge proponent of taking responsibility. I hate it when people hide behind ""reasons"" for shitty and damaging behaviour, and I will never be someone to forgive harmful behaviour because of some diagnosis. People are what they do, not what their brains have been initially wired to. So no, I'm not trying to ignore responsibility nor consequence, people get abused everywhere, which is inexcusable no matter circumstance, BPD or not.

I'm really grateful for your level headed and explanatory reply. While I wholeheartedly agree that there are plenty of cases out there that are damaging as hell, there are also cases of people out there trying their damned best (and succeeding), but still being met with stigma, being called monsters etc, which doesn't really help with awareness, suicide rates, and recovery.

Point 1, YOU feel bad, not your FP. Meaning priority n‚Å∞1 is to make yourself better, because even beyond that, if you can only think in terms of your FP, you feeling better will probably lead to better interaction with your FP. Get that sleep, that water, try to get some movement going (go on a walk, work out, dance, imitate all the animals and their movements you can think of very dramatically in front of a mirror), eat some food that doesn't make you feel bad (very empty words if you have an ED I suppose...)
Try to recenter yourself. You are you. Your FP is them. You are two separate entities with different lives. You have the most control over your own life. You have more control over what happiness and sadness occurs in your life (I know it feels like a lie when you have BPD but please trust me, it isn't).

One good thing for separation anxiety imo is to use the skill ""check facts"", pretty self-explanatory. Have they outright said their life is better without you? Have they actually consciously cancelled explicit plans with you to make plans with other people? Chances are that no, there really are no concrete reasons to justify that they hate you and are better off without you, it's your mean brain playing tricks on you.

I'm not saying it's exactly an equivalent, but it's a good start, and better than no therapy at all. If you'd like, you can contact me whenever to talk about things and DBT, and if you can't find any books (plenty of resources) you can DM me and I'll try to send what I can!

Two and a half years ago I had to move to a new country, fend for myself for the first time, met a person who actually showed me what sane love looked like, and today I've had access to DBT which was good help, medication, and help with potential ADHD, but most of all, I have a new way of looking at things. I doubt any of this, especially my changed way of seeing things, would've happened without doing this. Something needs to provoke change, and it's up to you to steer it in the right direction. As the others said, therapy can truly be a lifesaver. If it isn't working, it's probably just the wrong therapist or therapy type. One of my motivators was my bitterness, that I'd prove everyone around me (who were saying it would get better and that I should try this and that) wrong, by making damn sure I'd try everything.

BPD,firb13s,t3_f96wtp,1582660913.0,"Big mood, damn.

However; expressing your feelings (""I feel x because of x reason"") is not manipulative. Try to be as factual as possible, maybe take some time to think in beforehand what exactly it is you feel, to put words on it, and what exactly is the cause of it.

Expressing your wishes and needs is not manipulative. Saying ""I want this"", is not manipulative. It does in no way force anyone to do something. Saying ""When you do x it hurts me, and I wish you would stop"", is not manipulative.

What is manipulative is when one tries to force a person into doing something they wouldn't do of their own volition, or do based on the ""actual"" facts/reasons. Manipulating is concealing or lying about facts/feelings, basically finding a roundabout way where people will feel more emotionally inclined (guilty, responsible, feel pity etc...) to do what you want. When you say straight up that you want something, or that you feel something, it is up to the person to decide what they want to do. They still have the option to understand what's going on but still go against your wishes.
Basically, manipulating someone is partially or entirely removing their autonomy in making decisions, and being honest about your feelings or needs does NOT do that."

No, European and damn grateful to live in a country with democratic socialism where I have the right to healthcare for all sorts of ailments (for instance don't have to die because I can't afford life saving medicine or treatment, or be indebted for years because I dared need an ambulance), free education up to a master's degree, student loans from the state that I can pay back over the span of decades that won't cripple my economy, economic and practical support for both physical and mental disabilities, and talking about that, no one has to refuse going to see a psychologist or get any form of therapy or such because they can't afford it. And also much more generous parental leaves and sickness leaves in case of your children being sick. Sounds awful, right?

It's about the right to be treated equally, the right to not be economically or otherwise crippled because of inevitable events, the right to educate yourself, and the right to help to treat your health. Research has many times over shown that people living in countries with that type of model set up score the highest on the ""happiness"" (contentment) scales.

BPD,faapipv,t3_e8b7qc,1575911861.0,"Hey there, other demi BPD here. I'm not looking to invalidate you or anything, rather be educated/informed, isn't demisexuality though rather a question of only being able to sleep with someone when you have feelings for them? Meaning that, romantic and sexual interest can only occur together? (Although I'm sure you can have romantic feelings and not want to sleep with them) 

However, I'm really sorry dude, sounds like a shitty situation to be in! Can you think of any reason why you don't want to sleep with your girlfriend? What thoughts arise when you feel that repulsion? And why is your friend so sexually attractive to you, what do you like about them, can you pinpoint what triggers that attraction? Usually the way to try to fix things is to figure out causality and change things according to that. Sorry if I'm stating the obvious and hence sounding patronising!!!"

While I was trying to hint that seeing it could be beneficial, I sure as hell don't know what's best for others, so if this information helped you to reach a conclusion about what's best for you, then that's great! Maybe my blabbering did help after all. Take care of yourself! :)"

BPD,f9s5mx6,t1_f9pmf35,1575586328.0,"I totally understand your fear, but seeing that movie and having those thoughts and feelings won't just completely change who you are, your values, the decisions you've made, and the promises you've made to yourself. One big and explicit aspect of the movie is that the mental health help he has are complete bullshit. His therapist is disinterested, doesn't help at all, and at some point, the clinic closes, she announces to him that he won't even get his meds, and that's where clearly something in him snaps and a long monologue ensues. He has 0 help, only 100% invalidating people in his life who either dismiss or mock him. You're not in that movie, hopefully you're not in that situation, and you can get help. Right here, for instance, is some help already. I hope I could soothe some of those fears!

Edit: by ""help is right here"" I don't grandiosly mean myself like some conceited BPD healing guru, I meant this lovely supportive sub we're on!"
BPD,f9s3usu,t1_f9rppkr,1575585498.0,"I'd say it's still a worthwhile experience as I personally haven't seen anything else that has hit the nail so hard on the truly dark parts of trauma, psychotic symptoms, psychiatric neglect and consequences, and so relatable. Other movies and whatnot can be relatable on a smaller, softer scale, more neurotic behaviour, but this did remind me of my deepest fears and some negative thoughts, notable the one of ""I have my whole life made so much effort and exhausted myself to try and be normal, not crazy, not hurt others, haven't gotten recognition, just told it's not good enough, how ungrateful, if only they knew what it would be like if I stopped making all of that effort for them"" (not too well phrased). Keeping your knee jerk reactions, your symptoms in check is a sense doing what you can to conform to societal standards (for good reason, obviously), but it is in some sense a question of repressing yourself for other's sake, and I think for many of us, it's a lot of repression that costs a lot of effort, that can go by unnoticed, and feel hopeless and meaningless. And here, seeing the Joker in a more literal sense too stop conforming (breaking the law in all of the ways, his appearance, what he says etc), did bring forth some jealousy in me, and plenty of ""what if?"" question, and that quiet but constant feeling of ""why can't you see how much I'm trying to do it right?"". I mean, I don't expect a golden star for not running around murdering people and starting riots, but yeah, definitely made me confront some repressed thoughts.

Just remember that, no, it's not because you can relate a lot to the Joker here that you are one yourself, or that you'd be a murdering madman if you didn't make any effort. Absolutely not. Just because we can empathise with someone, doesn't mean that we are the same as them, especially for people with very high empathy, like pwBPD for instance.

Hard but worthwhile experience IMO!"
BPD,f9omwx8,t3_e68ecx,1575508524.0,"When it just came out in cinemas there were some posts about it on this sub, warning that it might be a certain type of shock, and when I did go see it, I realised what they meant. It felt almost a bit intimate at times, because I could really relate. It made me feel a bunch of things really. But one tough feeling/thought was that, I've always tried my hardest to keep myself in check, not hurting myself or others, keeping that psychosis at bay, and seeing that movie just made it seem as though letting go of all that effort and giving in to the madness would be so easy and comfortable, it really gave off an air of liberation that I was straight up jealous of!"
BPD,f90ttzu,t1_f90oe01,1574977249.0,"Well, I was terrified too. I grew up with an abominable mother who treated me quite bad, and my father was certain that she had BPD and studied multiple years of psychology in uni to ascertain it and in the end did a dissertation of it. I'd only heard bad things about it, but I quickly noticed that I wasn't ""normal"", and around 15 with all symptoms ravaging shit I was obsessed with ""am I BPD or not""  as if it was a death sentence. After multiple suicide attempts, I did get in contact with psychiatry who confirmed that yes, diagnosis did fit. Did it change who I am? No. It's not putting those 3 letters on it that change who you are or what to do, psychological diagnosi are just there to describe, not label you and stick you into a rigid category.

Now, saying curable makes it sound like two extremes, curable, or not curable. Like most things in life, I'd say it's a spectrum. Bad news is, no, it's not classified at totally ""curable"". It really did break my heart when I heard that. I've still to this day gotten jealous of a friend who's diagnosis is labelled as ""curable"". But that doesn't in ANY SENSE mean that you can't get better. Even if your brain tells you otherwise at times, not everything is black and white. You can get better, MUCH better, what's clinically established is that you can one day stop meeting the criteria for a BPD diagnosis. Does it mean that app your problems are gone? No. But you can learn to a) minimise them significantly and b) deal with them much, much better. Hence therapy. What's usually recommended is CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), which helps you change negative thought spirals, and DBT (Dialectical Behaviour Therapy) which is specifically designed for people with BPD by Marsha Linehan (blessed be that lady) that tackles specific thought patterns and behaviours common to BPD. I managed training away splitting on my own around the age of 16-17. I've been in DBT for one cycle (I wanted to continue but other things prevented me) whereas 2-3 cycles are usually recommended. 

What you need is a paradigm shift. Your brain has been wired both by physical factors and experience to reason a certain way, usually very oriented by fear (growing up with abuse ayyyy). You can learn to reduce/eliminate self-hatred, splitting, triggers, reactions, and cope with them much better. 
While you'll have to make effort, you can learn to make MUCH less effort and live a functional life.

It took me a life-changing encounter to get into that mindset, but this isn't a death-sentence. You wo6nt be as you are for the rest of your life. You can change that, but that change comes from you alone. Therapy can show you HOW, but it won't fix you on it's own. I won't lie, it's a struggle. But please believe me, you can make it. Many of us are making it, it's doable, and especially, it's REWARDING. You can have a good life, but you need to figure out the issues, get help on how to change them, and work on it, as if your life depended on it, because it does.

I hope this helped somewhat and didn't seem too gloomy. But trust me, you can do this. You're not inherently bad or anything. Life dealt you shitty ass cards, but you sure as hell can turn them around."
BPD,f8zenvr,t1_f8z58tl,1574960069.0,"Well I'm no professional, and it's hard to generalise what shape diagnosi can take in people, especially with BPD. It's a question of how many boxes you tick out of the general 9 (I think), a lot have other symptoms beside those 9 and some don't have certain. If you look at suggested subtypes of BPD (always take these with a grain of salt), theres the one who's more prone to outbursts (petulant I think they call it) and one more akin to the ""quiet"" type as many describe it, that's more impulsive than explosive, so mainly self-destructive and punitive.

Personally, I fall into the quiet category mainly, I'm pretty much always sad, not angry, however it probably has to do that my anger felt so scary to me since I was like 12 that I've repressed it so hard to the point to barely feeling it anymore (not healthy at all). I'd say at the end of the day it's a question of what triggers you, how it triggers you (what in particular makes you react strongly), and how you express/deal with those extreme feelings.

And no worries, I'm just happy if I can be of any help! But as said, I'm no professional, so take my words with a healthy dose of scepticism ;)"
BPD,f8y3v0w,t1_f8xdusm,1574940632.0,"My best explanation is the strong combo of lacking a sense of identity and intense empathy and thus mirroring.
