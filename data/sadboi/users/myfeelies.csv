ptsd,fowvrv3,t3_g9rmmj,1588128207.0,"Hi, I’m a therapist and work with kids, many with trauma. It sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms of PTSD, but without meeting you it would be hard to know if anything else could be going on in addition to that. You have good insight, are motivated to feel better and have done your research. Those are great things. Yes there are treatments that work. I would recommend asking your mom if she can help you find a therapist, specifically one who specializes in trauma therapy. Many cities/counties have victims resources or trauma centers which may have online lists of therapists who specialize in this type of work. 

Couple things I’d like to note here. 
1. A diagnosis doesn’t define you. It can be so helpful to realize there are others who have felt the way you do, that there’s a name for it, and that it’s not your fault. But a diagnosis is really there to help therapists identify the best form of treatment at the end of the day. Which leads me to...
2. Please get help. The sooner you start working on your mental health after developing the symptoms, the more likely you are to experience recovery. It can be scary, but I promise it’ll be worth it. 

In the meantime, there are some things you can do to help yourself in those moments of panic. Trauma lives in a part of our brains where time doesn’t exist. So when it gets triggered, our brain is reacting to the traumatic experience itself, like it was happening right now, instead of it feeling like a memory. Try thinking of things that can connect you with your senses. Chewing something like gum, taking a shower, naming things you can see/hear/feel/taste/smell, cold water on your face.. the list goes on. It can be helpful to refocus your brain on the “here and now” and stop the panic. 
Best of luck to you!"

I admire your commitment to your own wellbeing. Being an honest critic and holding oneself accountable for getting caught in distorted cognitions or unhelpful patterns is no easy task. A need for external accountability and motivation is why many people go to therapy, even if they have a feeling of what would be helpful. What you’re doing takes lots of hard work and dedication.

I can tell you’re really impacted by this, as anyone would be, and wonder how you think she would respond if you suggested couples therapy? Or if you have already.

AskRedditAfterDark,fhe4ds2,t1_fhdhlu9,1581513347.0,"Oh my gosh. What a painful existence. I’m so sorry both of you are going through that. 

It’s a bit of a long story, but I took a few months off from work and did what’s called partial hospitalization. The length of these programs vary based on the place you go and also on them issues you need to work through. Essentially it’s a therapy program mostly ran by therapists but they have psychiatrists that see you a couple times a week. There are groups where you practice DBT and CBT and we had art therapy as well. 

The main treatment approach for ptsd is called prolonged exposure. I’d recommend you do a little reading, but it’s essentially exposing oneself to the trauma through an “imaginal exposure” which is you describing the most traumatic event in excruciating detail, recording that, then listening to it again. Then recording again and so on. Followed by journaling and talking with your therapist to process. This helps decrease arousal caused by the trauma/memories of it, and with your therapist you can work on detaching your identity from what happened to you. The other kind of exposure is called “in vivo” which is doing things that cause you to feel anxious because of the trauma trigger, and being mindful of how anxious it makes you, starting with the lowest anxiety things and working your way up to the scariest things. Doing them all repeatedly until you don’t feel any which way doing them.

I’ve struggled with symptoms of ptsd basically since I was a young child, never got treatment through college and grad school, entering the workforce, through relationships. I didn’t realize that I was playing life on “hard mode” and that it was possible for my days not to take so much energy. That said, going to treatment was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Living the worst moments of my life every day for months  was incredibly painful, I went back to unhealthy coping strategies I hadn’t used in years, considered giving up on treatment and life itself, but I stuck with it and made it through. And I’m so much happier. I quite literally got my life back.

Ptsd is one of those things that can grow and change into a giant monster that impacts you in ways you didn’t even know possible, and can get worse and worse years after the trauma. I’m sure it feels horrible to feel blamed for something that likely happened before you met your wife, but the thing about trauma is that it lives in a part of your brain where time doesn’t exist. So when your wife’s trauma is triggered, she’s not reacting like she’s having a bad memory. Her brain and body feel like it’s happening in that very moment. Tough for everyone involved. 

Another PSA I’m also a therapist myself, which kind of adds another layer to my whole experience. And may leave you questioning why I would avoid my own issues lol My brain tried to tell me for years if I could just solve the problems of everyone around me, I wouldn’t feel so worthless. Oddly enough, didn’t work :) 

Can’t think of anything else to say, but please ask any questions that are lingering. Hope this helps"

I used to really want connection and physical intimacy but my body couldn’t handle the triggers so I would struggle to relax, connect and enjoy during sex, to the point I would often not remember much of what happened during a sexual encounter if I got a little triggered. It wasn’t so bad with someone I was comfortable with. I worked through a lot on my own but finally went through ptsd treatment this fall and let me tell you, I feel like my old self again. I can’t believe how long I went being constantly hurt and upset by something I really really wanted. Now I’m back to the playful, assertive and open minded partner I used to be.

I’ve had a very tough time remembering my childhood trauma and have been doing “prolonged exposure” therapy to process memories. It’s worth researching if you’re interested. Something that I didn’t believe would happen was memories becoming more vivid and memories I’d completely lost coming back too. Before starting this treatment i had roughly 20% of the memories that I do now of my childhood. As difficult as it is to remember the shitty things that happened, it’s been a blessing in disguise because I finally have a concrete reason to be so upset and truly triggered by my abuser, whereas before I only knew that I didn’t want a relationship because of bad things and felt like shit when I couldn’t give a list of specific instances leading me to that decision. If you’re searching for memories though, please PLEASE do it in the context of therapy. Memories coming back really fucked me up for a few months and I struggled even keeping myself safe.

ptsd,f914fju,t1_f90qz79,1574982184.0,I’m so happy for you! My doctor won’t give me anything for nightmares so I continue to suffer. I’m also doing prolonged exposure therapy so I think they’re hoping that’ll take care of them. I’ve also had terrible nightmares since I was 4 years old though. Solidarity!

ptsd,f8u5x8a,t3_e27zwo,1574820125.0,"Oh my god yes. I was just thinking today about how mean I am when I’m suicidal, which really only happens when my ptsd is super overly triggered. Almost like my subconscious wants me to make myself and others so angry at each other that it would hurt less if I’m gone forever. I’m going to apologize to my therapist tomorrow and to my family at some point. I generally cope by completely isolating and focusing on enjoyable activities and wellness until the suicidal wave has passed, but in an effort to change THAT habit in the last few months I’ve unintentionally caused a new one.  Currently not talking to family and friends (for a few days) in an effort to protect them from the irritability/rage."
