depression,fbwc1sy,t1_fbwbjme,1577145976.0,You certainly are not alone friend. I’d try and join some local support groups in your area.
depression,fbwaubc,t3_eesgje,1577145083.0,"Hey friend, have you tried support groups or individual therapy?"
depression,fbw9jg0,t3_ees680,1577144124.0,Have you tried calling a suicide hotline for your country? I’ve called/texted them a lot in the past when I was in crisis to make a plan to safely move forward. Wishing you the best friend. Know that you’re not alone and things will be better in the future despite how things may seem now.
depression,fbw972b,t3_eery4l,1577143870.0,I feel you friend. We can get through this darkness together. PM me whenever you need.
depression,fbw8rmq,t3_eeon1g,1577143557.0,"This is definitely normal with people with different levels of anxiety or depression. You’re not alone friend. Let me know if you need any specific advise, I’d love to help in any way I can."
depression,fbw8mp7,t3_eesc8v,1577143456.0,"Hey, I really relate with what you’ve said here and I know it sucks now but therapy and medication (if you’re interested in that) can be very beneficial in your position. Shoot me a message anytime, I’ll try to respond as soon as I can."
depression,fbw7gqw,t3_ees766,1577142679.0,This is extremely relatable. My depression and intrusive thoughts convince me not to eat even when I’m hungry. It’s quite distressing. In hopes of counteracting these negative symptoms I’ve tried to fight back and eat when I know I *should* be hungry or prepare meals in advance so I can plan for the future where I might not be motivated enough to eat.
depression,fbw7089,t1_fbhz729,1577142385.0,Thank you friend. Working with my hands on projects I’ve created has helped my mind stay busy enough the intrusive thoughts have trouble affecting me. When I’m trying to fall asleep is often when I have my worst symptoms and recently I’ve been thinking about positive events I’d like to occur in the future in hopes to boost my mood. It worked last night and I fell asleep fairly quickly.
depression,fbw6g5k,t1_fbw4tke,1577142031.0,Have you tried listening to podcasts or music as you walk? That can certainly make things more enjoyable and drown out those terrible intrusive thoughts.
depression,fbw6cax,t3_eer78x,1577141962.0,I feel you. Often I feel I just want to cease to exist and  be free from all my negative symptoms. My mind has recently been telling me to overdose a lot which is distressing but also comforting in a weird way. It’s strange. I just know I’m meant to be on this earth and that things have to get better eventually. I’m sure they’ll be a time in the future where you’ll look back on these times and be proud of yourself for hanging in there and staying alive through the toughest of situations.
depression,fbw5qvx,t3_eer8qn,1577141586.0,"I relate. I think it really is depression over laziness but maybe that’s just a way of me trying to cope with myself and my actions. The nice thing about brushing your teeth though is the sense of accomplishment you feel after you’ve done it. I look forward to feeling that accomplishment (even if it’s just a small achievement) more and more now. 
You got this!"
depression,fbw59na,t3_eera4u,1577141283.0,I feel you. It’s like life has lost its appeal altogether sometimes.
depression,fbw556h,t3_eerb1i,1577141205.0,Accomplishing even small tasks has proved helpful to me. Set some realistic goals and really work towards completing them. It gives you a sense of worth and happiness even if it’s just for a little while.
depression,fbw4q6u,t3_eerd0l,1577140942.0,I feel you. Doing things with my hands is really the only way I’ve found to keep my mind occupied enough to not be thinking about self harm or to start believing my intrusive thoughts. Have you tried going on walks? I went on one yesterday and I think if I make a habit of it there may be positive results. Wishing you the best!
depression,fbw3sby,t3_eerjs8,1577140410.0,I feel you. Especially that last sentence. I just can’t get myself to cry about things. Wishing you the best friend

Anxiety,f9ob7ub,t1_f9oa9q8,1575500459.0,You’ll have to talk with people about your anxiety if you want to get better. It’s going to be anxiety producing but you’ll thank yourself later for reaching out.
Anxiety,f9o9jsx,t1_f9o9b8m,1575499396.0,Are there any peer support groups around where you live? They are very beneficial and free.
Anxiety,f9o92pf,t3_e66612,1575499094.0,Talk with your mother about meeting with a therapist. They will help you learn ways of coping with the negative symptoms you’re having. Best of luck!
Anxiety,f9o8rib,t3_e66ypq,1575498897.0,Have you spoken with a doctor about this? If not I recommend speaking with one and being very honest about the symptoms you’re experiencing.

I was taking about 125mg of adderall a day in the past and my comedown took 4 days of pure hell. I never want to go through that again and I’m he best way for that to happen is to stop using. 

Drugs are incredibly two faced in that the effects can be extremely euphoric yet they have no regard for human life and will become determined to kill you and watch you suffer."
