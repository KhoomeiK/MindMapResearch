oklahoma,fl47n1h,t1_fl44csd,1584807697.0,I am immuneosupressed because of a medication I have to take and I have pretty bad asthma so I’m terrified. :( I haven’t left the house in about a week.
oklahoma,fl443ac,t1_fl43vzt,1584805451.0,Oh my gosh I’m so sorry. I hope you feel better very soon!!!
Frasier,fkpf99c,t3_fjuwc1,1584408736.0,No technically but the next night was! ;)
Frasier,fklm3vw,t1_fkkmecw,1584309601.0,"Oh yesss

And Oscar Wilde would have some biting commentary too."
Frasier,fjc02js,t3_fcb2lj,1583205275.0,Hahahaha wow
Frasier,fiza3jp,t1_fiz70kq,1582857726.0,Hmmm I was toying with an idea similar to “Mama Mia”. Someone doesn’t realize they’re dating their parent’s doppelgänger and Frasier and Niles are sharing a snide gossip about it ;)
BPD,fiwn8gt,t3_fa1imx,1582793387.0,"Yeah I’ve been pretty much completely asymptomatic since my last intense friendship ended. I faced being really alone, not having a “special person” and now I feel so much better but have no idea how to be close with anyone. I’m terrified it will trigger that cycle again but how long can I go without intimacy? How can I learn what healthy intimacy is without endangering myself and the other person?"
Music,fiwbmdx,t3_f7vigi,1582780413.0,Yeah I haven’t been able to find any of this. I feel crazy.
Frasier,fiw0854,t3_f9u86x,1582772070.0,"I love this so much!

One of my go-tos when I’m anxious or stressed is “Good Grief”. I find the structure of it very soothing."
Frasier,fit2j57,t1_fia9ni0,1582701736.0,This is my first time on Reddit and I’m so excited to know there are others in the world who not only notice the background actors on Frasier but think about them at this level. 😭
