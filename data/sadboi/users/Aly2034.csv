SuicideWatch,f4g0pmb,t3_dkfkaq,1571576378.0,"It seems that way for me, even though life's going somewhat great, it's the feeling that good things you worked for will always be taken away.  Then you'll feel it 2x worse the next round, just when you thought you were getting stronger.  Good things, like people you thought you could trust.  Marriage.  A good job.  Your savings.  The biggest ones are the Relationship/Marriage and Job.  Those two are literally on repeat with eachother, spending years with people that are nothing but deceitful, and working a job where you're never seen as a quality person, you're ""just there to be there and fuck your reasons for doing so"".  Getting told to love myself was the beginning part of the bigger joke, self improvement only meant improvement for those willing to take and use in the future, and that's all I've ever experienced.  And yet, I still hear the echo of ""it gets better.""  Yeah, sure it does, life just gets better hammering you in.  With that being said, certain things have to occur for me to have will to act again.  Because I'm honestly not willing to float around any more deceit when what's absolute and truthful lies on the other side.  Until then, I'm waiting for the anxiety and sudden depression to hit the right spot and it will eventually."

For me, it's continuous awareness to everything around me, the power of sight and sight of mind seems crippling.  But that's testing the waters of madness, I mean what can be more absolute than dissolving your conscious mind for a rest more deserving than many bedtimes only to return?  I've been near death so I know what she feels like when she's close, no track of time, everything shuts off like a switch.  I do not blame you, or much of my family thats tried breaking their binds here on earth, but just be sure you've done everything you can.

Trust me, I'm in the same pot, cooking.  I've been to a psyche ward against my will, I've seen the hospital emergency room multiple times, I've taken meds that do not help, I've since done everything I could."
SuicideWatch,f3sbe8g,t1_f3p29j8,1571100079.0,"I suppose, I'm just not of real sound mind.  Everything screams to me and it makes speaking let alone writing difficult.  My artistic talent hasn't been used in years if that speaks any volume to you.  I'd love to believe in the greatness of myself, and I've traveled many avenues to reach that but it all seems to float instead of falling into perfect place.  Im not sure if I'm occupied with a curse or just a bit of nihilistic energy, but it all makes sense.  It's all strange, and to place it correctly, madness had ever made more sense to me than anything constructed from peace, perhaps its all that I know.

Things happened today and could have taken a darker turn, but if I author any book, it'll be the description of madness in a physical form.  It'll probably be the only book, kinda like Mainlander, who hung himself on his own copies.  Even in a meditation, I can feel this shadow and it isn't even ominous anymore than what I used to perceive it as in my early days.  It embodies peace but a peace that requires the exchanging hand of pain, almost like staring off at a mountain and you see the dark clouds blanketing themselves at the peak, just drawing closer.  I'm unsure if you've ever felt time rush against your existence, but this presence is something I feel even in the event i fill my life with positive values.  I could DM you if you ever wished to speak, I've only got a few friends but I've already cursed them with my existence as is."
SuicideWatch,f3p1xgu,t1_f3p153n,1571038837.0,"I'm actually pretty new to posting on reddit, wasn't counting on this to be something posted but I'll give it a look.  As for horror, I couldn't write monsters into existence except the ones residing in our own minds,  the only ones that are real in this world.  The ones our environments breed and our circumstances nurture, nothing could be scarier and welcoming at the same time that whatever demon depression embodies.

On a side note, I thought about reading ""infinite resignation"" by eugene thacker.  Seems like a good read."
SuicideWatch,f3p0uvj,t1_f3ozb2h,1571037204.0,"It's something I've thought about since I've been wandering in fog for years but never had anyone tell me my writing was poetry, other than my unused talent with art in pen and pencil.  Mostly an artist here by nature, inking paper with what comes to my mind.

Solo endurance has been taking such a heavy toll on my mind that I can hear the bell in the distance.  Maybe one day if tragedy doesn't take me and peace finds my mind I can focus on what I want to say with clarity.  It's just been serious lately, and the closest I came to writing a book was when I stared down nothing but black for months with a lava lamp beside the bed.  Couldn't be anywhere else in the house since the room I slept in had the scent, and the walls where everything used to stand triggered vivid memories of the person I married regardless of the horrible things that's happened.  The whole house became a space for a larger shadow where the void has reach, and it DOES reach.  You just can't tell whether it's choking you or wrapping its arms around you, it just wants you to come home.

If I did write one, it'll be on human tragedy because the universe knows its children are aware of every price they've got to pay, even their mortality."
SuicideWatch,f3oz3va,t1_f3oyte7,1571034685.0,"Only from a lot of reading and listening to lectures, I'll understand things better.  But no, I could use some work and yeah, I can't recall the last real thing I've felt besides being a young boy reaching for dreams that were hollow.  To be completely honest, I'm running on bones and I don't know how I've survived to 30."
