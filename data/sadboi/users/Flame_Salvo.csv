As per grades, have you tried reaching out to any of your teachers for extra help? If not, you should, you‚Äôd be surprise at how willing most teachers are to help you understand the material. 

I don‚Äôt have any advice to offer on your situation at home sadly other than to try and find a coping mechanism that helps you feel better (preferably one that doesn‚Äôt involve self harm)

I know how hard all of this is for you, but your strong enough to make it this far and I know your strong enough to keep going. And if you ever feel sad this whole subreddit is here for you. I hope this is helpful to you.
