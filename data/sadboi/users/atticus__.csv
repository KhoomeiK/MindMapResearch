The host, Robert Evans, is a legitimate journalist who puts a lot of effort into each episode. There is a 3 part series on Jerry Falwell, considered to be the founder of the religious right. I think you will find it very interesting and informative. Fair warning there is a bit of comedy to the podcast, but the content is solid.

With the other things, you said it yourself - ""oh I'll just spend a little time."" You're giving yourself a taste of those things, letting the cycle continue.

I tweaked some meds last week so I'm hoping that'll help with my focus and attention span a little bit.
