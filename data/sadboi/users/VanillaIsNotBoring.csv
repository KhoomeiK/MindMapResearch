Parenting,fpi5jcv,t3_gdff93,1588634084.0,"I know you have received a lot of similar responses already, but you're definitely not alone.  Working at home with a 3 and 6 year old and it's awful!  Also add having to be a kindergarten teacher to the 6 year old... it's too much!

My husband is not working that much and does help, but doesn't take it seriously that I still have a full time job to do. He also doesn't think it's going to matter if we submit all the school assignments for our daughter because she's only in kindergarten, so guess who has to work full time plus take care of all the school assignments and school meetings? Yeah, me. I can't wait for the school year to be over because then at least we won't have that.

Can't see my marriage making it through this... can't see my sanity making it either.

Hang in there OP, and anyone else who is going through something like this."
unpopularopinion,fo0vvax,t3_g50jmw,1587420735.0,"Agree... I don't get it.  How is that supposed to make someone graduating in 2020 feel better? It's like saying, ""look, I had a real graduation and you didn't.""  I sure hope people don't start posting prom photos too, that would be even worse. At least 2020 seniors have already had their senior pictures taken, but they will not get prom pictures."
unpopularopinion,fn2a5gg,t3_fyve33,1586582253.0,"Agree... I never got the appeal of macaroni salad, egg salad, potato salad, chicken salad, etc.  The worst is tuna salad.  I don't see how anybody could voluntarily eat that.

I can eat Italian style pasta salads that are not mayonnaise-based, but that's about it."

UnsentLetters,fmo0no0,t3_fvlgcb,1586241163.0,"I know this was not meant for me, but I can relate.  It is awful having these feelings and not being able to do anything about it.  I hope it works out for you one day."
AskWomen,fmnq7tp,t3_fw9sp3,1586232281.0,"Clairol Natural instincts.  It is semi permanent and not too damaging to the hair.  It's good for subtle changes and/or covering a few grays if you don't have that much gray.  When I can't get to the hair salon (which might be the case in the next couple months), or when I've had moments that I feel my hair has gotten too blonde from highlights and I need to cover them up, this is what I use.  

It always goes on darker than the box though.  Light brown looks dark brown on me for the first couple weeks.  I am going to try dark blonde next time if/when I have to use it again."
AskReddit,fmnlfqg,t3_fwbsc9,1586228816.0,"Flavored seltzer (La Croix is my favorite) and lightly sweetened iced tea.

I will occasionally slip up and get a diet Dr Pepper from the vending machine at work, maybe once or twice a week.  (This is not an issue right now while I'm working from home.)"
unpopularopinion,fmnagcp,t3_fw5lwh,1586221658.0,"I disagree, so I am upvoting.  However I do agree about Reese's being mediocre. There are much better peanut butter cups out there, such as Trader Joe's dark chocolate peanut butter cups."
AskReddit,fma76g9,t3_ftzd2p,1585885582.0,"I've learned having an office job is not so bad.  I don't like working at home every day. It's good to work at home occasionally (once or twice a week), but 100% working at home sucks, especially when you have kids at home that need a lot of attention and a husband that you are fighting with most of the time.

I even miss my 45 min commute.  Mindless listening to music and singing along in the car while driving to/from work sounds pretty good right now.

(Note that I am grateful that I have the ability to work from home and still get paid, which I know is not the case for a lot of people.  I know that things could be a lot worse.)"
Anxiety,fm5yeuw,t3_ft3nko,1585782504.0,"Thank you, this made me feel a little better just now. Trying to work at home with two young children in the house is SO HARD.  I feel like other people are holding it together and doing a much better job than me.

I think we should all realize that doing the best we can given the situation we are all in, whatever our personal situations may be, is probably good enough right now."
self,flwg6bb,t3_frkij9,1585549518.0,"I'm not a senior citizen (I am 40), but I think around 2016 or so is when I started to lose interest in most newer music.  I try to listen to the hits channels to convince myself I am not an old person, but can only tolerate 10-20% of newer songs. As far as rap music, late 90's to early 2000's was great, but I couldn't even name any recent rap songs."

unpopularopinion,flwdocm,t3_fri5nv,1585547102.0,"I agree with you, but this is probably  because I have always hated plain milk.  I don't know why anyone would want to ruin a perfectly good cookie by dipping it in milk."
sex,fkg7o8r,t3_fi94i7,1584152024.0,"I had this happen to me about four months ago... it was a super intense attraction I felt to somebody random, and I'm still not completely over it.  I'm 40F and married with two kids. Even though my marriage has problems, I know this would never work out and it's stupid.  I just need to get over it already.

I have tried to focus on other things and just forget about it.  I have fantasized about him a lot too, but I think that just makes it worse."
