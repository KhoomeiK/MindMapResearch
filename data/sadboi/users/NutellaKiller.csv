Based on what you said it seems like you developed an unhealthy relationship with food (and calories). I'd suggest to seek help as soon as possible. It might be challenging during these times, but I hope everything is gonna be okay.

And until then, remember. Food is not your enemy. Food is fuel for your body. Just like gas for a car or water for a flower. Nourish yourself and blossom like a beautiful flower.

Out of the blue I started to feel extreme guilt for the amount of food I've consumed that day. I said, ""fuck it, go big or go home"" and I binged and purged. It was terrible and very painful.

When I started dating my current bf we usually met at the dorm where he lives (yepp, he's still in college like me, so he lives in a dorm) or we went to my private place (I inherited a house so it's a good option for us). I don't think I'd be able to have sex in my parents house again with my parents being around (like literally in the next room).

sex,eus1wxf,t3_chb1pm,1564002116.0,"Me and my bf, we did it in a park. On a bench. It was our first time having sex together. We live in a busy capital, there's a hill in the middle of the city. It is huge, lots of trees, benches, playgrounds and there's a statue on the top of the hill. Most people only walk to the top and they walk back on the way where they came from. But you can walk down on the other side of the hill (it is also lovely, benches, trees and view (the panorama) is breathtaking) it's a little less crowded. 

It was March, the weather was still cold (4-5 celsius degrees cold). It wasn't planned, but he brought a warm blanket with him. I was sitting on his lap, on a bench, facing towards him and he covered me with his blanket. It was midnight. It happened right there. 2 times. And because of the blanket it wasn't super obvious. Only a couple people passed by, but when we spotted someone we stopped immediately and covered our faces. The blanket was covering us already and we wasn't naked under it anyways. ""Maybe we are just a lovely couple cuddling on a bench on a cold night, who knows?"" 

So I suggest you to find a spot that is empty and pick a late hour. 

We also did it in the restroom of his uni, but I feel like it was more private. The stalls are completely separated, the buliding was almost empty. But the heat. Damn, it was really hot in there."
EatingDisorders,eufzi76,t3_cgb3qk,1563795998.0,"Don't worry, these thoughts are ""normal"" for someone with anorexia. 

When I was anorexic (yes, you CAN recover), I always thought my ED was a victory, my neverending journey, it made me unique, special, almost better than others and def better than healthy-me. It was mine. It was me. 

You feel powerful having control over your diet and your body. Oh yes, sweet starvation, I remember laying on my bed, I felt empty af, I imagined myself walking on my own pale and skinny body and I did it, I fought my carnal instincts. I felt like I was capable of doing that therefore I was better than others. The harder my parents and doctors pushed me to recover the harder I detained myself from getting better, thinking I wouldn't let them take that, my ED away from me. 

So yes, I believe we all fear of getting better. But you don't have to go back to anything you don't want to. You can gain control over other things in your life. Having issues like this in your life might keep you away from reaching actual goals. It'd be sad if your only goal in life was being skinny af. 

I'm not saying I wanted to recover. At least not for the first 4 years. But then some major changes happened in my life and I realized I couldn't continue ""sabotaging"" my future like that and that's how my mentality slowly changed. So give time to yourself. And be patient"
