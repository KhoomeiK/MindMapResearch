MK9 actually did it well and had a lot more chapters, 16, than 12 they started doing right afterwards. That extra 4 chapters could do a lot to not make them feel rushed.

trees,f4z6ysd,t1_f4z6f5a,1571897453.0,Yeah it just gets lonely af working nights and sleeping the day away when the worlds awake. Especially if you have no one to come home to in the morning.
pics,f4cgfuv,t3_dk3384,1571528754.0,Js but to point out the obvious that no one else has the balls to...if this was a white woman it would have like 3k upvotes or something for being an ok cosplay. But...
MortalKombat,f476n23,t1_f46sfef,1571418043.0,You never see his face so I’m surprised they even modeled more than the one eye that shows
gaming,f3zlmus,t3_dix85t,1571271865.0,"Except most of these games can be found on other systems as well, which have even more RPGs. Just wish people would stop sucking Nintendo’s dick all the time and getting thousands of upvotes for it when it’s nothing special

Edit- hell Skyrim’s been out 8 years now. Dragons Dogma 7, Witcher almost 5. Everyone’s played the shit out of these games on better consoles or pc. You can brag on them when they have more unique exclusives like Zelda"

funkopop,f32hln7,t3_dfe5vp,1570610048.0,"Big time fighting game fan (MK, Tekken, Soul Calibur, Jump Force) so I was happy to see such a niche genre get some love. Hope to get more soon and stop buying so many Game of Thrones pops. 

Edit- The scarring on Kazuyas face and chest look like scuffs on the figure in this pic. But they’re pretty detailed scars!"
reddeadfashion,f2v0s8y,t3_ded964,1570439660.0,Did Rob Liefeld design your character?
MortalKombat,f26d5qd,t1_f26d3in,1570003992.0,"MK9- Freddy and if you can count Kratos vs Rain, Kenshi and Skarlet. Idk how that’s 50% even counting Kratos who wasn’t DLC just PS3 exclusive

Injustice- Scorpion vs Batgirl, MM, Zatanna, Zod, and Lobo"
MortalKombat,f26bjc1,t1_f26begl,1570001754.0,"“Look dumb” can be rectified with the new game man. Frost was literally a Sub clone and look at her redesign. Part Cyber, not quite Cyber Frost but still retains some of her original character. That’s what reimagining means. To modernize them and have them fit in modern day MK. Hell even Shao Kahn always looked dumb but now looks badass. I listed off characters that would do well from this reimagining."
MortalKombat,f26allk,t1_f26al2b,1570000549.0,"He’s not coming, as said by the actor. He doesn’t fit and if he was coming he would have. He’s not popular enough to be a guest character, which is what they look at for sales"
MortalKombat,f269h4v,t1_f269g20,1569999169.0,"Yes, he should have been my 6. A badass Dragon King that rivals Shao Kahn or Raidens power."
elderscrollslegends,f269av7,t1_f25l2o6,1569998953.0,Thanks
characterdrawing,f23e26v,t1_f22l3hf,1569919320.0,I know right this is awesome...I hate it!
NatureIsFuckingLit,f1ymmzl,t1_f1yl050,1569819668.0,I like how the very act of asking if it’s a jojo reference has become a meme itself.
MortalKombat,f1grtxe,t3_d99g80,1569475283.0,"Anyone remember that hype ass music video in the extras of MK Deadly Alliance where Scorpion is chasing Quan Chi through the netherrealm and they have a cool fight?

That was the first time I realized there was actual story in MK and feuds between more characters than just Scorpion/Sub or Lui Lang/Shang Tsung.

I was probably like 10 when Deadly Alliance came out so I didn’t pay attention to any story from the other games even though I played them. I never beat the ladders back then

Edit-
[Not as hype as it was when I was a tyke](https://youtu.be/22tCfmdLT_k)"
securityguards,f1g97ju,t1_f1fpm2m,1569462527.0,"Some sites are great, some suck balls. All for different reasons. You get what you get with my company. 2 days a week I work nights at a site I love. So chill and can just hangout and watch cameras or walk around and find someone to talk to. The other nights I’m at a shitty site with a tiny guard shack with no ac and a porta potty a quarter mile away."
ComicBookCollabs,f1dazd5,t3_d7u0ex,1569378608.0,I’ve been looking for someone who does good b&w and creative use of negative space. I’m gonna DM you
