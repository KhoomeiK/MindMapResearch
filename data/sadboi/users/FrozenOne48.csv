Well, about a week ago, on a morning I was feeling especially discouraged, I wrote ""I am so grateful that everything is finally falling into place,"" and about 10 minutes later I got a phone call regarding all my dental work that was approved (one of the manifestations I wrote down a couple weeks prior, as its never been approved in the past). Then I did the water manifestation technique combined with SATS about finally moving in with my long distance SO; right when I finished I got a text from them saying they were able to figure everything out and that I just need to choose the date :) just gotta wait a couple more weeks and we'll be living together which is HUGE considering the whole situation was extremely complicated. Point is, after this my confidence in manifesting has skyrocketed and I've been receiving sooo much since then. 

To name a few (all from my list), I received a great discount on a purchase, and purchased protein powder in a particular flavor I was told the brand I wanted probably didn't have, but the worker would check at the other store just in case. lo and behold they had it. I also counted these two together because I also got it for 50% off.

Manifested a new game I wanted but didn't have the money for. Manifested a pretty rad t-shirt without any specifics (actually got two, a Ghost In The Shell t-shirt and a Voltron t-shirt from two different people).

If you focus on the lack of what you want, you're just gonna create more lack of that particular thing. The universe answers to what we give our attention to, it's not bias. If you focus on the ""I never get what I want"" rather than your desire (and not necessarily how it's gonna manifest, just that you want it), then yeah, obviously nothing is gonna get better. Also stop acting as if life is awful without the things you're asking for. Ask for what you want, focus on THAT instead of the lack of it, be grateful for what you already have and be happy with life right now. That's how you align yourself with what you want. 

I'm still relatively new to LOA but once I started focusing on my desire, understanding that it already exists (the money I desire is already printed and waiting for my alignment, for example) and just trying to be content with everything I already have, little manifestations come super easy now because I'm rewiring my brain to focus on the good shit and not the lack of it all.

lawofattraction,eub20jw,t3_cfmvov,1563637783.0,"I'm an artist, I will always be an artist. When I was younger so convinced that I'd be an artist and make money that way, and I didn't mind if I was poor. After awhile everyone convinced me it wouldn't be a good career money-wise, so I opted for something else like psychology and even considered teaching. 

I was actually lucky enough to find a passion for fitness and nutrition and I am now determined to become a certified personal fitness trainer, and I also chanted my college major from Visual Arts to Nutrition. But again, I AM an artist, I will ALWAYS be an artist and my SO really pushes that on me which is awesome. I might not wanna go to some fancy school (not taking a jab at you!!) or do something like Design (like the cool art you see on billboards, commercials,etc.) or Architecture but I can't NOT make art. So, while I pursue my career in fitness, I also wanna do things like portraits for commission, when I move to a better location I'm gonna look into apprenticing under a good tattoo shop, and I even had an interview yesterday for a job as a painting instructor :) 

The thing is, you have to really observe how something makes you FEEL to determine if its right for you, and when you do that you'll be able to let go of resistance. For example, I was going to do Graphic Design but it didn't feel right and I stopped pursuing that, but I still wanna be creative so I found *how* I can be creative and feel good about it."

Honestly, just drop him, OP. He's a manipulative child who youve even admitted you're not compatible with. If you have to fight so hard to keep a relationship going just to feel shitty at the end of the day, the love will never be worth it. Not to mention, you gave it a week tops--of course you're both going to be miserable. It takes time to move on and that time depends on the individual.

Hell it could even help to flip the script and ask ""why *do* I have this?"" because your subconscious mind can't debate what you ask, it simply tries to answer it and therefore eventually it believes you to have it.

And of course! Basically, I either draw out a bank deposit slip or find a sample slip through a quick Google search and I'll write/type My Prosperity Bank Account above it, as well as what day I'm on. The right side will have: 
Account owner's name (me) 
Account number (random or something that's meaningful, doesn't matter)
Memo (what youre spending the money on--be detailed and fun about it)

Left side will have the date, the amount of money and sender (I put the universe). 

For day one, you ""deposit"" $1000 into the account. Spend it on whatever you want, preferably all on that one day. The next day, day 2, deposit $2000. Day 3, $3000, and you just do that for however many days you want; I'm gonna try for at least a month.

â€¢pay for my grandma's new septic tank because she deserves it
â€¢a brand new gaming laptop so a girl can get down with some gaming! 

The point is not to be restrictive, act as if you can afford whatever it is you want. As the days go buy it gets a bit more challenging to think of things I can buy so they get a little wild which is exactly the point, be as creative and imaginative as possible because it raises our vibration and gets us to believe we can have whatever we want.

All that said... It really is a struggle but I just eventually became okay and accepted the possibility that my twin may never come back to me and funny enough, it sped the process up it seems.

twinflames,eryfp91,t3_c4pgpc,1561407508.0,"I was a serial dater who wanted to be loved without loving in return. I was basically the poster child for emotional unavailability, lmao. I broke the hearts of guys who worshipped the ground I walked on because I could not connect with them emotionally, and in turn got my heart broken by emotionally unavailable guys I did connect with (mostly those who, in some way or another, resembled my twin) and it was just a vicious cycle for a long time. I had to take a step back and force myself to actively remain single basically for the first time since I was 15 (I'm 23 now, and the longest I have ever been single was 9 months).

Probably the hardest thing I ever had to do because I craved the affection I didn't get with my abusive ex of 5 years, as well as from my crazy mother as a child. I never learned how to properly express myself so I had to take steps to learn how to communicate with others, be open with them more, ask for help, practice self care. And above all else, understand that I don't need a romantic partner to determine my worth and I will be okay with or without them--that also included my twin, who I was 100% convinced I'd never hear from again. But it was so worth it because, though I don't completely love and accept myself, I learned so much about myself because I wasn't being defined by another human being. I became my own person, which is exactly what I needed to become for my twin and i to actually be able to be together (which we are now). :) 

I also want to add that I don't regret any of my experiences. I'm not experienced in relationships by any means but I value the lessons I learned from each one, whether they were casual hookups or veering towards a serious relationship. I learned not to settle for half-assed effort or connections, that I'm valuable both in and out of a relationship and that I could love others freely (i actually cannot help but love everyone in some way) and that my love should not be exclusive to my twin, because I love them in a vastly different way."

I go through really bad depression bouts but I never take it personally when people don't reach out after isolating myself. 

I'm not saying it's your fault because it certainly isn't, but it also isn't really hers either. It's no one's fault. She's probably either busy, thinks you're busy, our that you're angry with her.

Block them on all forms of social media, if they contact you in some way, ignore them. If you run into them in person, stonewall them by giving them no emotional response whatsoever and go about your business. Also, change your Netflix account password and delete her profile of you can. 

All that said, its n not easy but it's pretty much the only route to take with toxic, manipulative people like this. They want you to react so stick to not retaliating for sure. I also suggest cutting off any mutual friends who choose to ""not pick sides,"" As they've already chosen a side--and that's to ignore her behavior entirely and allow her to slander you. I lost quite a few friends who chose to ignore the abuse I went through because it was easier and really, are those they types of people you want in your life? I don't. Good luck."
relationships,eqh8u29,t3_byg73z,1560051981.0,"Honestly, I don't know how to tell you not to be jealous because jealousy stems from insecurity, which in this case I feel is kind of inevitable when it seems like you want to get back together whereas she just wants a relationship without the actual label (in other words, without the commitment or effort).

If you want to stop being jealous, be upfront with her about what YOU want. If she doesn't want the same thing, that's fine, she's entitled to that but that doesn't mean you have to settle. If what she's looking for doesn't align with what you want, then walk away. Don't allow yourself to be lead on by someone who has said they don't want a relationship."
relationships,eqchta6,t1_eqcgnza,1559969980.0,"Rape falls under the category of sexual assault, but sexual assault is not exclusive to just rape. Sexual assault is described as a range of criminal sexual acts, such as unwanted touching, kissing, rubbing, groping or forcing the one to sexually touch the perpetrator. Again, sexual assault overlaps with rape because the term includes rape--but it does not mean rape."

relationships,eq2yc0p,t3_bx3aa8,1559746293.0,"You didn't even do anything wrong. Your boyfriend is manipulative and abusive--at the least psychologically from what I've read. Giving you a lifelong STD that he KNEW he had seems more like a ploy to make sure you won't leave. Talking to multiple woman and slandering you behind your back is a typical narcissistic move to get his ego fed while also ensuring he has a back up if he ever did end up leaving you, etc.; rooming you to be with other woman as a couple, despite your reluctance and hesitancy is the same thing--and then blaming you for it was to steer blame away from him, as with your sex life. The blaming and finger pointing on his part is to tear you down, make you feel shitty and go to him for validation, which makes him feel superior. He knows he has that power over you. 

Honestly, I know it's probably not what you wanna hear, but if he loved you he NEVER would have done any of these things, ESPECIALLY giving you a fucking STD he was most likely aware of. Leave him. Cut ties entirely. I went through something extremely similar with my ex of 5 years and the relationship turned physically abusive, to which I was blind to for YEARS. don't let it get to that point because it might."
relationships,epydkfr,t3_bwlc2k,1559629133.0,"I am not a people person whatsoever, I have had the same friends since elementary school and only a scarce few as an adult. My partner, my best friend and my family are the only people of can honestly tolerate being around and talking to every day, but if you introduce me to new people I will run outta fuel quickly.

I have a friend who I'm not suuuper close to but I enjoy his company and we've always had a good time hanging out. Though I rarely hang out with him, or anyone outside of those mentioned above, because I just wanna go home even if I'm having fun, it's just how I am. 

I'm not codependent and I don't hate people, I'm just an introverted homebody who needs equal recharging time when I hang out with someone and many people don't understand that. Hell, I also enjoy my alone time away from my friends and family as well. My point is, don't force friendships because others might think you need to. If you're happy and your partner is happy, what's the problem? Not to say you can't make new friends but the best friendships I've had so far have come from a real connection, as well as someone who understands that they won't hear from me for 5-10 business days after a hang out.

relationships,eodkawr,t3_brg7pt,1558474985.0,"So I was with a narcissist for years and though I'm not familiar with female narcissists (I've read that women are more covert about it), I am familiar with manipulation and gaslighting--and that is exactly what she is doing. She is absolutely entitled to her feelings but the problem here is that she CLEARLY believes her feelings Trump yours, always. No if ands or buts about it.

As for the phone call, it seems more like a ploy to get your attention for ""ignoring her"" And trying to make you feel bad. Another manipulation tactic. I'm not one to call bullshit when it comes to sexual harassment and assault but you're absolutely right that she can SOMEHOW call you and loudly discuss it but can't find help where she's at seems fishy. I've been stalked and sexually assaulted and I was lucky to shoot a text for help and eventually found someone on-hand to help me, so it just doesn't make sense to me either. 

I would leave her. I know that probably might not be what you want, but I feel like if you're asking for advice then you've reached your limit. She is toxic and obviously cares more about herself and her feelings than how her actions affect you."
twinflames,eocb5et,t1_eocadwi,1558455662.0,"The ego is part of who we are, yes, but that's not really the point of my post. It is also responsible for the insecurities we feel and generally what blocks our intuition--and again, it's more of something that just happens and not something I do intentionally at this point. I don't *actually* tell it to fuck off. I just find it to be a pretty big accomplishment that I, who has wallowed in insecure thoughts my entire young life, can easily dismiss them without much effort now."
twinflames,eo9cjr3,t1_eo99eyb,1558388023.0,"Precisely! I mean, it hurt that I (from.my perspective at the time) came second but I basically feel like he had to hurt me so that I'd learn to forgive without malice and learn to choose myself first, and obviously the same for him. I want to always be selfish with him but its as if I physically can't, I always want him to do what's best for HIM, even if that may or may not include me. Like the distance thing, we're currently working that out and it's really not that big of a deal because its easily fixable but however much I wanna say, ""come back here right now,"" and that he'd likely comply, I just can't because 1) that's not fair to him at all and its not just about what I alone want anymore and 2)  well, divine timing I know it'll happen soon enough. Lol

I'm preeeetty sure he doesn't know about twin flames and even if he did I don't see him buying into it so I'm not gonna bring it up, but he does confirm the connection and we're always just in constant sync, and that's something I know I won't get with anyone else hahah. 

Same to you and yours as well! The work really sucks at times but so worth it."
twinflames,eo96wwd,t1_eo953qm,1558383798.0,"Yeah of course, I hope I've answered them to the best my my abilities hahah. 

1. He has always been the one to break separation, so when my 5 year relationship ended he kind of fell right back into my lap and that's when we first established a romantic relationship, but he was with someone else and it did suck. I was in a really bad spot emotionally myself, as were they, and even though we'd made plans to be together I just somehow knew it wasn't the right time. I was never necessarily jealous but insecure that he'd choose them over me, which he did for a time but I just couldn't bring myself to feel any negativity towards him, I genuinely wished him the best and hoped they'd be able to give him everything I thought I couldn't. Turns out he was afraid of the same thing (that mirroring, amiright? Lol) and that's why he ran.

2. We are actually in a relationship now! And it is monogamous. I love others A LOT and value my relationships with friends and family (so definitely more of a spiritual connection with others), but when it comes to a romantic sense, it's always going to be him. I mean, I know I am capable of having romantic relationships outside of my twin but the connection isn't the same. It just comes naturally, like it's out of my hands. The timing this round just feels right though so we're going with it. I'm not insecure anymore, I actually feel far more secure now than I ever have before with anyone. We actually communicate what we want and expect and how we feel and I feel as if the foundation we're currently building off of is pretty strong."
twinflames,eo916sx,t3_bqyrtx,1558379645.0,"For me, the connection with my twin is like nothing else and I've ALWAYS known that. But I met them when I was very young and didn't even know about twin flames until about a year ago, we were in separation and I was in a relationship. Prior to that I was in a 5 year relationship. After coming to terms with the whole thing, I no longer wanted to be in the relationship I was in last year but stuck it out nonetheless and it ended up runnings its course and I do not regret it. 

On top of that, when I was learning about tf's I was already in separation and was 100% convinced I'd never hear from them again and I didn't wanna waste my life waiting around for them. So I accepted the connection, but also accepted that my world doesn't revolve around them; I had far too much love to give to others than just to them so I moved on, and even dated, without really minding whether or not we'd ever reconnect again because it was never really about that for me, personally. They helped me discover who I REALLY am and shaped me into the me I am today--thats a miraculous gift in and of itself. Being able to love others unconditionally and without expectations outside of my twin was a lesson in learning that I don't HAVE to only love them, I can love others and myself by myself. 

Needless to say, that actually sped up the process and separation is no longer an issue, save for physical distance. But even that's speeding up. But my point is that, for me anyway, 3rd party relationships were necessary and important for my growth and I do not regret them."
