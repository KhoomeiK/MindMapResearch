These two pages of a picture book just might spark an interest in wild animals in general and you could get him other books about animals, coloring sheets, watch videos, etc and see if anything else sticks. My son is currently obsessed with Corduroy and Paddington and I've watched him reenact the books around the house and have bought him props to use and he's so delighted when he gets them and I love seeing him make the connections. 

But... if the meltdowns gets crazy, take the book away. My son was obsessed with these weird YouTube videos with cars and colors when he was about 2.5 and when we would turn them off, he started to have almost violent outbursts. So, that was that."

Also... think about this for a moment. Keeping a household running is a LOT of work. We all know this now, especially since we're stuck at home in a never ending cycle of cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc. Now that I'm home with my kids 24/7, it's not like I can give them 24/7 attention because I have to keep up on all this other shit. When they were both in school, they had a structured part of their days where they were entertained, doted on, etc 100%.

2. He only had five pictures of himself, all in a military uniform (""himself"").

3. His bio said ""Looking for a wife."" That was all.

4. His opening lines to me were telling me how beautiful I was. My Instagram is mostly pictures of food and my children.

5. Despite supposedly being in the US Military, he did not find it at all strange that I said I lost a husband to a cavalry battle in a war fought over 150 years ago. Also, I don't believe we've used horses in battle for at least 100 years (no citation- but horses and the Civil War are good enough clues to know I'm bullshitting).

6. His ""military spouse"" died in a ""gun battle."" Wars haven't contained formal battles in decades.

So, through analyzing all these context clues, I Columbo-d my way to this conclusion. In fact, I figured this all out just by observing points 1-2, but was up early and thought I'd entertain myself by fucking with him.
