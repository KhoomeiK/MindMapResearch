TheCloneWars,fr3cih3,t1_fr326sd,1589854464.0,What book is this? I've read about this scene over and over and want to check out the actual chapter
Naruto,fr2pmrr,t1_fr2njwx,1589841510.0,"That's annoying I agree. But we know everything about Naruto. Boruto knows nothing. Like thinking back to when your parents were teens, probably don't have a lot of information to go on. 

As for the clones, I think they addressed his by showing how upset the family gets when he uses clones."
Naruto,fr2pdc1,t3_gm7xxs,1589841371.0,"You are thinking of it wrong. It's not that he suddenly had more time. He just learned how to balance. He was always home before hokage. 

It's not crazy to think that the most powerful position, in a post-war/future-war world, would be very time intensive. 

I didn't like it to watch either, but I think it is very realistic that he is human, has flaws and isn't perfect."
Naruto,fr2bwcn,t1_fr26zny,1589834634.0,"It actually seems kinda real to me. That's why I don't like it. Didn't have my dad around much and it's pretty similar. 

Naruto's goal was always hokage. He never even had a family. So it makes sense that he puts his life goal first, and doesn't know how to balance."
Naruto,fr22rf4,t3_gm7xxs,1589830157.0,"Proceeds to never be home, even with a loving family waiting"
StarWarsBattlefront,fqz44zv,t1_fqz1qjz,1589759583.0,"Then stop playing? Even with getting a couple details off, the point is the same. Why do you deserve to keep getting free dlc? 

If you hate it so much then why are you playing? Maybe because it's a good game and you enjoy it? If you think otherwise, pick a new game then? But youve probably put hundreds of hours into battlefront and still complain. 

When would it have been enough? 10 skins for Yoda? Customizable cod pieces for stormtroopers? Stupid skins for guns that make no sense like cheetah print?"

povertyfinance,ewlvd60,t1_ewlt2le,1565536845.0,"We should talk about all those things. They all contribute to the problems these cities have. 

The problem isn't that these people chose to live in a expensive city, or are complaining that they can't move to Beverly hills. The problem is they were already living there before it became this expensive. People who have lived there for generations and now are underwater from landlords raising rent, foreign millionaires buying properties, gentrification, institutionalized racism, stagnant wages, loss of overtime/benefits and all the other things that have slowly driven up the costs.
