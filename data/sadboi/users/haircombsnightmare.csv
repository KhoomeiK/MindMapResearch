So yeah, some people are looking for drama. I don't think all ARMYs are the same but since it's a large fandom it also has a larger amount of people who will go out of their ways to start drama.

As per Blinks, I suggest watching angelina (Youtube). She made a video again expressing an opinion about BP's dancing, not even bashing or dissing. She received so much hate she broke down crying in another video.

Advice,fqaaksd,t3_ghpscf,1589215751.0,"\>  I honestly can't tell if what he did was normal 

I can assure you it isn't. What he did was incredibly horrible and he knew he was harming you.

You didn't lose your virginity or the money. You chose to have sex with him at the time, because it's what you desired. Because you didn't know better at the time and because we cannot predict the future, only learn from the past. 

So forgive yourself first of all, because you got screwed but *you* didn't screw anyone. You had good intentions that were unfortunately put in the hands of someone who didn't.

Why did he do this? He's likely a sociopath. He chose you for a reason - you were younger, more gullible. An easier victim. This is a common pattern. 

My advice for you is get angry - incredibly, incredibly angry at him for what he did to you - until you realize you were wronged and guilt has no place in what you feel. And when you get so angry that you realize the piece of turd you were dealing with, you can grow stronger and flush the toilet for good. Then wish him a good life and let him go.

We were all innocent at some point. We were all screwed, so don't feel alone. I can assure you if you ask women in Reddit if they went through this before, most of them will have a story for you. You'll be fine and you'll meet better men. What matters is you learn to value yourself, learn to look for red flags, and learn what limits you will want to set in future relationships.

Tight hugs, you deserve much better."
Advice,fq9ll5r,t3_ghlqff,1589201633.0,"It is often used as a manipulation technique. I've been there too - my dad used to threaten to kill himself whenever I did something he didn't like.

The fact that it was his friend who told you, and not your father himself, just adds an extra layer of red flags on top of it. It is likely your dad asked them specifically to tell you so you would feel guilty and contrived on what to do.

My advice to you based on my own experiences is the following:

\- You are *not* responsible for him, for his happiness or depression. Even if he went through with the suicide, which I hope he doesn't, it is not your weight to carry. You don't deserve to be carrying someone around, even less so if this is someone who hurt and abused you.

\- If you truly feel you can't deal with it, trying sending him a written message. By phone or face to face he will try to control you, but by message you can just sincerely tell him how you feel without needing to face him.

\- Who th is this friend? This sounds like a toxic person, involving you in your dad's problems. I think what he did was pretty out of place. The friend himself, if they are worried, should have called a hotline.

Lastly, I would talk to your mom about it. I'm not sure how she feels about him, but she might be able to offer you advice or comfort. Don't carry this on your own, and block that friend. Feel free to ask me any questions from past experiences, even if each world and each relationship is not the same."
Advice,fq9ktgh,t3_ghcw5k,1589201073.0,"I think you're letting the pressure build by not talking it out, and it's taking a toll on you. If you're hearing voices or feeling anxiety all the time, you do need to see a specialist who will be able to give you a treatment. Treat it as if it were a disease, rather than something you're doing wrong - because it's out of your control. 

Sit down with your mom/dad, and explain to them what is going on and how you feel. Maybe they don't entirely understand you, but just try to get the message across that you would like to see a professional about it. 

Not sleeping is very stressful and detrimental to the mind. Medication or therapy can help you get back on track."
Advice,fq9k71w,t3_gh8ufw,1589200604.0,"Man, maybe I'm going against your wishes here but I think it is rather unfair to your brother.

Chances are this is going to upset them, or you are making your parents choose between you two when they can't realistically leave him alone as he has special needs.

I would try to imagine it as if it were your parents wedding, and they wouldn't invite your fiancée because of her disability. It would probably upset you and force you to choose between two people you love.

But you know more about your relationship with your parents/brother so it's up to you. Personally I would prefer to wait and go the extra mile to have my family there, including my brother. But if you choose not to, just keep in mind they might not take it as lightly as some commenters seem to assume.

I'm getting EA vibes."
PetAdvice,fpvavn6,t3_ganzlq,1588940350.0,Check if they're legal. In a lot of places they're not legal pets anymore. One of the reasons is how long they live for. I wouldn't recommend them as a pet.
