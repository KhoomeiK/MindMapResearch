Once I lost all the weight I started working out, doing strength training, mainly body workouts (push ups, pull ups, chin ups, squads, stairs, walking, etc). I started focusing on abs about 2 months ago, I think. Now I use weights for the rest of my workouts. 

I still eat healthy, no junk food, juices, soda, etc, and try to keep my meals within 400-500 calories range.
