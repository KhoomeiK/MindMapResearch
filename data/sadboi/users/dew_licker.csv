COVID19_support,fqoh6q7,t1_fqob9fn,1589515153.0,"Thanks man. I realise in the grand scheme of things I am probably better off than most and being rejected from jobs is hardly the most severe suffering that can befall a person.

In Australia we called for an investigation into the outbreak, which immediately sent CCP politicians on the attack likening our country to gum stuck on their shoe. This is not how you speak to nations reeling from loss which originated in your country.

We joke a lot about the US but I shudder at the thought of China becoming a superpower and passing the states. We hope the orange man gets shafted and you guys get some real leadership, trust me regardless of the jokes we want you to succeed."
COVID19_support,fqo8r7s,t1_fqo5mr2,1589509913.0,"I am not in the US but have been getting financial aid. This will only last another 4 months and without income from a job or business after this time I will be in poverty.

I believe the world should unite against the CCP so that evil/totalitarianism does not triumph in this world. This is a tall order as politicians strike me as cowardly people who will sell their own mothers for a buck.

Right now I hope I can survive until (if?) my business can go back online and in the meantime also apply for other jobs. This is a problem as I have been in one field for so long I may be in store for being constantly rejected which would really kick me when I'm down."

CentrelinkOz,fotpp92,t1_fotp3yh,1588061717.0,Thanks for your response. I did get a payment on 27 April. There was no supplement.  My next one is in May and there is no indication of the supplement being added to it. It states the amount that does not include the supplement. Will this be updated when I complete the income reporting? Apologies if I am being dumb.
CentrelinkOz,fot9lag,t3_g8x4uu,1588047883.0,"Please would you guys help me out. I am on JobSeeker and reported for the period 11 April to 24 April. I was paid $518.70 on 27 April.

I have another reporting date on 08 May. It says my next payment will be 11 May @ $518.70.

I was told and read that government policy is to increase the rate by $550/fortnight due to Covid-19. Will I get the $550 once I've reported my income on 08 May? 

Do you have any idea why they are not paying me the correct amount? What should I do? 

Thank you for any help in these trying times."

If you have one panic attack on marijuana your brain is primed to look out for another one, condemning yourself to an increased probability of having one in the future. I think this is what you were getting at when you spoke of perception and self-awareness. It is most likely multifactorial as are most things."
NoStupidQuestions,f91ngif,t1_f91m18n,1574995401.0,Thanks. More reading and I've figured it out. I have a single 8Gb chip and another 4Gb chip with a different rated clock speed. If I put this 4Gb chip in will it then run in dual channel at the lower of the 2's clock speed? Would this be a better idea purely from a speed perspective ie apart from the obvious benefit of having more RAM will this configuration speed up my laptop?

ATTMindPodcast,f8gci0j,t1_f8cogtb,1574557575.0,I've listened to it and it boils down to epigenetic changes. The question I have is why? Is it some form of protective mechanism where your brain is telling you it's time to end your relationship with marijuana?
