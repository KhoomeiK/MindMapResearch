BipolarReddit,fqcoe6h,t3_ghprmd,1589263814.0,"Prozac might be an option. I was on it for years. It helped with my depression, but not mania - and I had a LOT of that.  So it may help in your case. Personally, when I had a new doctor, he put me on Effexor, as he said Prozac doesn't work for mania.  Effexor changed my life, but I miss my manic episodes where I could get a lot done (but don't miss my psycho mania)."

BipolarReddit,fqcntmu,t1_fqbq6z3,1589263323.0,I've had Chantix sitting on my desk for a couple of months now.  I'm afraid to take it.  What was your experience?
vegas,fqcgsxf,t1_fq8huic,1589257843.0,OMG! How awful!
90DayFiance,fqcf9py,t1_fqbbae8,1589256767.0,"I disagree, somewhat, with your statement about racism and capitalism.  More so about capitalism because we don't really have that here.  It's more like crony-capitalism/fascism imho.

But I agree with everything else.  In Las Vegas, they just spent over 8 million dollars to temporarily house 500 homeless people! That's insane!  How many people could we house for a year on that, paying all expenses and giving them job training, rehab, whatever?

As far as LA goes, all I know is what I've read in the media; and I can't understand it.  If a person CHOOSES to be homeless (and some do), that is one thing; but there is no good reason why we can't help those in need.  It shouldn't happen in THIS country!  

Personally, I DO live in a rural community.  The one thing I like about it, is if someone needs help, someone always steps up.  The churches here are VERY good at helping people (I'm not a Christian), and there are different places where there are food boxes out for anyone who needs it.  

I also agree that fast food is not great, but it's something to fill your stomach.

Oh, and my husband mentioned a week ago the same thing you said. Why haven't the homeless been getting help BEFORE this? Same thing with the meals for kids.  The money for all this is there, but it's just not used for it's intended purposes.

I always wonder when there are big donation drives or a celebrity donates millions of dollars, where is that money going?"

90DayFiance,fqba0ej,t1_fqaqzu5,1589233195.0,"There ARE options here; albeit they are very difficult to utilize if you don't know the 'system'.  We have many charities here that help people.  It's not perfect, but at least it's something.

In the U.S., I tend to think the working poor have it the hardest.  Living paycheck to paycheck. One emergency or a vehicle breakdown and you're screwed.  You make too much to get any kind of assistance, but not enough to get ahead of the game (even a little).  

Even with that, we are still the 1 per-centers of most of the world.  Most of us don't have to wash clothes by hand (we can go to a laundrymat if we don't have a washer), we have fast food everywhere (so we can get a meal for a couple of bucks), we sleep on mattresses instead of the ground, we have TV and cellphones, etc...  So many LUXURIES that we take for granted.

So yes, we have options.  Maybe not the best, but we do have them."

Even the poorest here in the U.S. have options.  You can get food at a soup kitchen, get a bed in a shelter, go on welfare to get foodstamps, health care and section 8 housing....  There's NOTHING like that in most countries.  Our ""issues"" are 99% self induced.  Whether it's drugs/alcohol, mismanaging our finances, leaving beyond our means, or just plain old poor choices.

But it didn't affect me the way you describe.

I'm thinking it might be a side effect of meds you are taking and/or a hormonal imbalance.   My husband insists that I changed after having my daughter (30 years ago), and not for the better.  So you might want to see a hormone specialist."
