AmItheAsshole,fqix9mk,t3_giww2y,1589402131.0,"Commenting about getting a tailor. You might be better off getting custom garments made. I love the website eshakti. They always have coupons for shipping or percentage off, so don't pay full price. My friend who recently had a reduction surgery was very pleased with their garments. Part of the issue with tailoring is that you have a small frame... You have to start out with a much larger garment to accommodate your full bust measurement meaning the shoulders the arms, the sleeve length, the waist... Everything is the wrong size and needs to get changed because adding fabric to go larger isn't really an option when really it's one measurement that isn't accommodated by standard sizing matrix. The most important thing to keep in mind is: your body is not wrong. It's the clothing that is wrong. I make a lot of my own clothes, so it's a bit easier for me to keep this in mind because my clothes are right and all the other clothes are not.

Also I wanted to recommend a couple of books. ""The gentle art of verbal self-defense"" is absolutely amazing. It's a bit dated, but the lessons are absolutely relevant... And honestly I find the somewhat dated language pretty fun.   A book that has been really helpful for me in feeling like taking action to enforce my reasonable boundaries is logical and fair (and not retaliation or punishment) is the book ""the sociopath next door""

Hang in there. You've been so mature and patient through all this. I can't see where you've overreacted. And you're very measured in admitting that you shouldn't have cursed at her, but that's pretty minor compared to the bullying.  She made her bed and really set herself up. If she had behaved as a professional there would be no issues."

relationships,fo06g16,t1_fnzk6v2,1587406907.0,"I think we're becoming more and more tribal... On both sides of the aisle. Obviously, what your parents did was grossly irresponsible and that is the level of trust that you should afford them in the future unless they prove themselves trustworthy. Take a break and cool off. You have no obligation to support their views  and you should focus on your own peace.

That being said, I have found it extremely unhelpful to label my parents narcissists... I recently read a book called ""adult children of emotionally immature parents""... And it points out our societies obsession with diagnosing in order to render treatment. Likely your parents exist on a spectrum of bad behavior and it probably doesn't make a lot of difference to you what that label is, rather what boundaries you need to have to keep a healthy relationship. I think Reddit over does black and white thinking... You have to cut your parents out or off if they behave in ways to disagree with. In reality you want to have a relationship with your family. (I'm reading between the lines, but you sound sad at the idea of cutting contact) so, you should approach the issue as deciding what kind of relationship you can have.  The book I mentioned is very good at a practical approach to the issue. 


Besides that, I have found that asking and listening without trying to change somebody's mind... And asking with the idea of truly trying to understand the deep logic that goes behind someone's beliefs is the only route to change. People need to feel understood... That's the entire reason people communicate.  A book I found helpful for being empathetic without condoning is ""I hear you The surprisingly simple skill behind extraordinary relationships"". It's been absolutely amazing for being able to take a step back from the emotional involvement with my parents without feeling like I'm shutting myself down in the process.

Your parents are living their own life... You don't have to condone their behavior. I wish there was something you could do to get through to them, but it seems like they put a lot of effort into constructing an echo chamber."

CoronavirusOklahoma,fkucae2,t3_fkaxhj,1584546678.0,"Oh I forgot to add to my previous comment... You're 17, right? An important life lesson is that you are your own advocate. It's your job to care about your own interest, health,  well-being, money, time, etc, etc, etc.   this is something an older cousin explained to me as advice for college, and I found it very applicable to my experiences navigating healthcare. 

Be as polite as you can be, but be persistent. A lot of the time the person you're on the phone with doesn't have the power to help you even if they want to. You are your own advocate.  If the person you get ahold of on the phone can't help you ask them for another number or another idea of who can help you. Healthcare people are getting hit pretty hard right now, so they're more inclined to go the extra mile to help you if you're nice to them.   Keep trying different approaches until you find someone that can help you.

I also forgot to add to my previous comment: use a notepad or a document on your phone/computer and do medical charting for yourself. Write down a log all of the medication you are taking and what time you take it (and when you can take the next dose.. It's helpful for keeping track). Write your temperature down and the time you took it. Write down your symptoms. Keep track of what days they develop.  It's all useful information and if it's already taken down you can share it quickly and easily. You can tell any healthcare professional exactly what you've been doing to manage your symptoms."
CoronavirusOklahoma,fkub83y,t3_fkaxhj,1584546078.0,"There's a backlog of people that need to be tested, so it might be difficult or impossible for you to get tested immediately. 

Call your doctor and arrange for virtual visits if they have it set up yet.  Be sure to write down your questions. I give this advice for all doctor visits because I use it. It's impossible for me to remember everything I want to talk about with the doctor, and Doctors are used to leading the conversation, so it could be difficult to remember your questions, especially if they don't ask if you have any questions.  

Obviously you should discuss treatment with your doctor. You should also ask when you should follow up, and at what point (if your condition deteriorates) you should go to the hospital vs calling them for advice and which hospital you should go to.  Whenever I have a medical issue I ask this question in some form... I consider it hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. I pretty much ask the doctor when exactly I should worry so I don't have to debate whether or not I should worry. 

The current guidance (to my knowledge) is to remain at home unless your conditions worsen enough to go to the hospital. If you need to go to the hospital it's important to call ahead and let them know that you're incoming so they can direct you to the correct arrival location. (Hospitals are working on setting up systems to keep covid patients separate from the general population... This is early in the game, so it's possible that your closest hospital isn't prepared yet but another hospital is ready for you.)

CoronavirusUS,fkiaumr,t1_fkhg9te,1584215673.0,"Likely not. Water treatment takes care of that. They specifically disinfect human-born pathogens. In my city chlorine is added after filtration. They add enough to where the water remains sanitary in the lines until it comes through your tap. Water is good for drinking but it's not considered sterile. So you shouldn't use it for something like a neti pot or where it's important for the environment to be sterile like in surgery. So, it's clean like the food you eat.


 Even more to the point of making you feel safe, in my city they do dead end line maintenance. That means they go out where water lines don't loop back into the system (so the water isn't fresh enough for chlorine levels to remain high enough to be considered safe) and they flush out the water to make sure that it will remain fresh enough on dead end lines.  this is why it's recommended for you to run a tap for 10 to 15 minutes after a trip where water isn't used in your house for an extended period of time.

relationships,fkapfau,t1_fk9rb6x,1584016031.0,"Feelings are not stupid. They're feelings. You have them and being upset at yourself for having those feelings is punishing yourself twice. I'm really really sorry that you're struggling. Change, even change for the better, can be a real struggle to get used to especially when you're going through social changes like you are at 13. It can be tough to have more and more responsibilities even when there aren't a bunch of changes in your life.  Ask for support. here's a possible suggestion of how to express it... Of course you should follow your own line of reasoning. ""I'm very happy that we have a larger family but I'm struggling to feel okay with how different it is to be part of a big family. I miss our one-on-one time, and there are parts of being an only child that I miss a lot, too. I'm not used to being part of a family and it's been a struggle to feel like I am part of a family even when everyone's been nice to me and I don't really know why that is."""

sewing,fjl950r,t3_fdh0ct,1583442317.0,"My friend subscribed for a while and she shared some patterns with me. It seems like a great resource for beginner seamstresses because the projects are very snappy and simple which appeal to people trying to build their wardrobes and it is excellent for people who sew more casually and don't like to devote their whole weekend to a sewing project.

Personally? I'm not a huge fan of many of the patterns without modification.  Most of the sideseams are straight (likely for speed and accuracy) but in my opinion the finished shape would look way better with a bit of a curve in at the waist and I usually make that modification.  My second reason has to do with how fast they go together. Sewing is a major hobby if mine and if I banged out clothes left, right, and center my CC bill would be atrocious. These days I like when projects take some time."

Your sister is doing exactly what she needs to do. She's exploring and learning a little of everything.

relationships,fjha92v,t3_fdcxvo,1583344235.0,"Be there and listen. I highly recommend the very short and to the point book called ""I hear you: the surprisingly simple skill behind extraordinary relationships"". It's a quick read and it outlines why it's so helpful to listen and not try to fix someone's problems and how to be validating of someone's feelings even when you don't agree with them. It's very helpful to reassure and drive home all the ways that ""just being there"" is a positive and helpful response.

I'd also like to point out that statistically speaking only very few women have never had something similar to them happen.... So there is a high probability that your wife is reeling from being reminded of scary and damaging situations she's lived through in the past.  A new event stirring up old trauma is what lead me to seek out EMDR therapy. If your wife is struggling to cope after this incident it might be worth looking into some sort of PTSD counseling. ""The body keeps the score"" is a really exceptional book that explains why Trauma is so hard to get past and outlines different therapy approaches in a hopeful and validating way"

Yes, you're entitled to feel uncomfortable and want him to stop... But I think that maybe you should examine your own cultural assumptions. In some cultures friendships encompass physical trust that more puritanical cultures view as sexual.

You're going to school? Sign up for free/ low cost counseling. Tell someone who won't judge but will help you figure it out what is best for you.

It sounds like you're having to keep yourself from being yourself in order to be the person he demands. You're having to smooth over the drama he brings into your household. You're having to stuff down icky feelings about sex that makes you uncomfortable rather than taking things slow and learning to enjoy. It sounds like you're having to rationalize that stuff is fine in theory.  

In the end I think my biggest advice is: In everything you should be a team. It's you and your partner against the issue. When you're putting a ton of work into making it work and still not seeing accomodations on his part then you're doing all the work for both of you.
