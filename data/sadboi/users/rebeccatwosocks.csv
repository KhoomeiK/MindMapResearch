My significant other's stepdad is one of those super-far-right-wing guys who never graduated high school but think he's a massive intellectual and likes to look down on other people for the smallest things. He also thinks that C0VID0-19 is a ""scam"", and then later on said; ""It's literally not as bad as the flu"". Anyway.

He told us this advice and that he had been using it his entire life basically to get where is he today. (He makes good money for an oil company and has a cozy desk job) Before he moved up the ladder he worked in construction. He told us that he use to claim on his application that he was proficient with all different types of construction equipment in order to look like an exceptional candidate. Then, if he was hired, he would tell the person training him that the equipment he used before was a slightly different model, and the coworker would essentially then ""re-train"" him, so he knew what to do.

I mean, if you don't have the skill or patience to graduate high school (Which, come on, it's not hard) then I guess I understand why it's necessary to do whatever you can to make a living, but Jesus, it's so fucking unsafe to lie so blatantly when your job is literally operating huge machines that could kill someone.

askphilosophy,fqtowd2,t3_gkvgc8,1589643211.0,"In order to process your question I think you ought to think about the reverse. Many philosophies express an idea of ""overall goodness"" in regards of treatment of others and one self, ""whats good for society as a whole"" style of thinking.

There's the individual level of ""goodness"" - happiness/fulfillment/etc, that sort of promotes the idea that if you are happy you have more to give to others, so to speak.

>According to Aristotle,  **happiness** consists in achieving, through the course of a whole lifetime, all the goods — health, wealth, knowledge, friends, etc. — that lead to the perfection of human nature and to the enrichment of human life. This requires us to make choices, some of which may be very difficult.

Happiness, or personal fulfillment/the gratification of achievement, can be understood to be human progression towards perfection.

Very possibly, the reasoning behind why it is ""bad"" to be harmful others is because it does not benefit them, or yourself for that matter. And sending someone to prison (which could arguably be wrong or right) is done in order to promote the overall good of society. There is also an argument that prison is rehabilitation for the people who end up there, while there are some prisons/jails in certain countries that are more or less successful in this area. You could also entertain the idea that if someone does ends up in prison that it could be the most beneficial thing for them at that moment, as they will have time to reflect on themselves and their lives, and realize improvement needs to be made. Akin to how Aristotle stated that ""...humans are required to make choices, some of which may be very difficult.""

Consider looking more into utilitarianism, the idea that actions are ""right"" if they are useful or beneficial of a majority. Similarly, there is Jeremy Bentham's model of maximum pleasure and minimum pain that's also pretty relevant to your question. Hope this helps in some way."

yikes, I think I don't want to see those interactions, it sounds pretty petty to be honest. 
It really sounds like you two got off on the wrong foot. I want to assume that you are not rude to your teacher to his face or otherwise, because of the amount of work he gives you or for other reasons, because that is not going to help you get a good grade.

Again, in order to work towards a good grade, I would suggest emailing him privately outside of class and asking for help in specific areas you are having trouble. Maybe take some time to write down a few possible questions you have for him about your current assignments. 

It seems pretty clear that the best time to ask for additional help isn't going to be during direct instruction, and it would probably be best if you took notes during that time instead to study later when or if you struggle again.

I can promise you that you are not sworn enemies with your teacher. You may not enjoy his class and that's perfectly fine, it sounds difficult. But rising to the occasion and completing all of the necessary work will make you a better student, and ultimately help you succeed in your school life outside of his class. So honestly it would help you to drop that mentality and see that your teacher is a human being, just like you, and not out to get you.

Again, if you really believe that he is unable or unwilling to help you, try emailing him so at least you have the recorded proof of what you are going through. But, again, I'm sure he will be happy to help you when he knows you genuinely care about his class."
