In the meantime, try to chill a bit and sleeeeep. :) 

(And heads up, whenever you do get in, you will drive yourself to a mental breakdown if you stress this hard over your grades going forward lol. Remember, that number is not a reflection of you as a person, and neither is an acceptance letter)"
McMaster,fr01ibu,t1_fr01cph,1589781018.0,"Ah, I just noticed a comment where you implied you didn't choose humanities because it was ""harder"", maybe you meant harder to get in. Sorry if I misunderstood!

Which of the social sciences are you most interested in? :)"
McMaster,fr015jw,t3_glnx2g,1589780731.0,"Current SOCSCI student. I was in high school a loooong time ago and this is not my first postsecondary program. 

Just curious about the theme of this thread... Are you trying to get into the easiest program or what? Why are you even pursuing university?

Going to university as a default option before you're ready is an easy way to dump way too much money and too many years into something you don't actually care about. I've been there, and I know lots of people in the same boat! 

If this is truly important to you, go for it... Are you truly interested in social sciences? Otherwise, my advice is to make sure you know what all your options are, and pick what's really right for you!

There are even people who get paid to help you figure it out.

Take it easy and relax, in the meantime. School is school, it's not life and death. :)"

You can even sort the spreadsheet to show only  what you're looking for.

Hope it helps, spread the word!"

Gundam,f11qqjo,t1_f113kmb,1569129253.0,"I'm not sure I agree with this... In most popular storytelling, there's one principal character (the lead) surrounded by a cast of secondary major characters (""main""). Then supporting characters, and so on. In my circle this would be intrinsically understood, so let's take a step back and remember that we all come from different places! And maybe interpret language differently! 




Alsooooooo threatening to permaban someone over a semantics issue and some minor sass is a little hardcore there bud. You ok?"
