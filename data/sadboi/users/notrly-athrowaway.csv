AmItheAsshole,f92dymc,t3_e37xy5,1575026321.0,YTA I don't understand how your older daughter staying could've prevented you from calming the other child down. You say you didn't kick her out to punish her but it sure looks like it. You could've just sent her to her room. And she's just a child I'm pretty sure she thought of this situation as a joke and didn't do it to upset her sis.

AskReddit,f5ra8op,t3_bmh1nv,1572390863.0,"""I'm so tidy and like my stuff organized! I'm soooo~ OCD!!!""

No you aren't. I have OCD and I'm not tidy at all. On the other hand I can write a book of all the awful and weird things my brain makes me do everyday in order to live a few minutes without anxiety."
ADHD,f5r6c3q,t3_clt3km,1572388908.0,"I've had OCD my entire life but lately on top of everything I've been experiencing weird things that might indicate ADHD. I can hardly concentrate on anything, I get really excited about doing things, two minutes into doing anything I get bored and switch up to something else. I'm bored all the time but I can't and don't want to do anything. I used to love watching movies in my free time or whenever I feel sad as a way to immerse myself into a fictional world and forget about my problems for a moment. Now whenever I start watching something I stop in a few minutes for no apparent reason and resume doing absolutely nothing. At school even If I'm actually interested in what the teacher is saying my mind drifts off to anything but the lesson. Lately I'm not able to do anything and everyone thinks I'm just being lazy but I think I might have a problem. Rarely I find myself really into an activity and do nothing but that thing for a few days straight, I don't sleep, I don't go out and in a short amount of time I decide the thing is pointless and go back to doing nothing. I stay in bed on my days off because I'm too scared getting up will trigger some sort of compulsion. I'm used to dealing with OCD but the other things I talked about started happening 2 months ago and I have no idea what to do about them. Talking about this made me really sad because I just realised how unproductive I am. 
I'm sorry this post is all over the place but I'm trying to say all that's on my mind."

AmItheAsshole,f53yf42,t3_dmil69,1571966584.0,"NTA I'm surprised the girl hasn't done it already even tho her mum forbade her. I wasn't allowed to shave too but I did it anyways and eventually my mum told me: it's your body do whateva you want with it but don't complain when you turn into a hairy gorilla one day (that's exactly what she said lmao).

Parents who don't allow their kids to do stuff like that srsly make mad. Letting your daughter shave her legs is not going to ruin her health but it is going to help her accept the changes her body goes through and stop the bullying! Some mums bring the ""but she has to accept herself the way she is, it's just hair everyone has it, she shouldn't be ashamed of it"" BS, well guess what, kids are a holes, they don't see things from the same perspective as u do and they are going to keep messing with her...
 
I understand why you feel bad about your niece but imo you should let your daughter get rid of her body hair if she isn't comfortable with it.

And just a little question to all the parents who don't allow their kids to shave: WHY? It's just shaving no big deal, the hair's gonna grow back anyway."
