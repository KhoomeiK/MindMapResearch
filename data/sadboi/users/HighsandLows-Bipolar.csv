WatchPeopleDieInside,f9p4kgr,t1_f9oeqf6,1575521511.0,"Lmao, not quite. So here is the story.
I had been married to an abusive man for 10 years and finally got up the nerve to leave him. When I told him I was going to be filing for divorce his words to me were “the only way I’ll ever let you leave me is if you go and fuck another man”. So the next day I made an online dating profile. Flash forward a couple days and many many many sleazy messages and unsolicited dick pics later I was ready to delete the account and go about things the old fashioned way at the bar lol. But I looked at my new messages one last time and saw one that stood out. Amongst all the horrid pick up lines there was a simple message that read “how’s your week been?” Grateful for the message that regarded me as a human being I answered. We hit it off pretty quick and later that day I gave him my number and deleted the account.  

The idea was that this was a smart, funny, attractive man who I would not be repulsed to have sex with and lived within driving distance but far enough away that I wouldn’t have to see him again if I decided not to. Day 3 of talking to him is when we had set for me to go visit him. I was terribly nervous as I hadn’t been with anyone before but my ex husband. We talked on the phone almost the entire hour and a half drive. When I pulled in the driveway and he was waiting at the door my heart sank. He was even more attractive in person and I was sure that he wouldn’t be interested in me once he saw me in person. As soon as I walked in the door he pulled me in for a kiss and he noticed I was shaking and we laughed about me being nervous. Things led from there and I had the best sex of my life until that point. As we laid there afterwards he played with my hair and we talked. I couldn’t believe how everything just felt right.

On my way home from his house my family was blowing up my phone since none of them knew where I was and none of them knew my ex and I had separated yet and he had convinced them that I was having an affair. That evening my ex let himself into my home and held me hostage for the whole night and I wasn’t even allowed to sleep. There was crying and pleading from him and an attempt to propose again. At one point he suggested an open marriage. All of which I refused coldly. 

I then moved into my mothers house since it wasn’t safe at home anymore. I was having a very bad day at work and a bad day dealing with my ex and my family and when I got off work there was my now fiancé. He had drove all the way down to see me for the 30 minutes extra I had between work and picking up kids simply to make my day better. 

Within a week of meeting each other online we had exchanged I love you’s. But then I panicked. This wasn’t what I had planned. So I stopped talking to him abruptly. About a week went by that contained a couple hook ups with other people and a very very terrible blind date that my best friend will owe me for until the end of time. I couldn’t stop comparing everyone I talked to with him. So I sent a super long message begging him to forgive my panic and give this another shot. We picked up like nothing had happened. 

A couple months went by and he had met my dad and my children. My mother was refusing to help me find my divorce if I kept seeing this man. I was in a pickle because I was living paycheck to paycheck and trying to save for a divorce. I had a restraining order against my ex that gave me full custody of the kids but he hadn’t been served yet since he worked away so he didn’t know that I had full custody since I was still allowing him to see the kids. My ex found out that I had full custody and called me making veiled threats and stated that he was on his way home and would be there by midnight. I did not feel safe at my moms since she didn’t take the order serious so by sunset I had all the belonging I could fit in my suv loaded and my kids and we were on our way to my now fiancé’s house since he had offered that we could always come there for safe harbor and we had already discussed me moving in. That was almost a year ago and my kids have grown fond of him enough that they prefer him to their bio dad and dread going to their dads for visitation. My mother did give in and help with my divorce which will be final this month. We have plans to be married next year even though I don’t have a proper proposal yet or a ring since that is being kept hush so my soon to be ex husband doesn’t delay the divorce and ruin the wedding date."

It took me about 2 years with my ex husband to find what worked for me. Since then I can almost always orgasm. I have been with big and small, curved and straight and from my experience a medium and curved dick provides the best orgasm and the most reliable one too. Or maybe that’s because I’m in love with the person it’s attached to lol. Either way, find what rhythm works for you and what angles.
