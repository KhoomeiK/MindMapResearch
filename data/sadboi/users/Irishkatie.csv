MentalHealthSupport,fprdbqy,t3_geyemf,1588850910.0,First of all it's not dumb. I am sorry this is you first post I am reading seems like you have been though alot from you suffering. What I know about PTSD is that it's hard when paranoia is around certain people and with the other diagnosis it takes time to overcome with what's hard for you. Maybe take time and prepare yourself for social situations even on the phone. For me I am more black and white thinker and sometimes if people annoy me I will blank them to save my pride but with everything it doesn't comes so easy. Lately I don't care after all I have been through and I am the one that has to pick up the phone to talk to certain people that I want to stay in my life. Life is full of ups and down and things take work for where we want to be and sometimes even making friends means you have to put a bit of work into it before its a steady friendship. Only you know how much of your pride you want to let go of to see if you can build on your social circle and to think of what's causing an issue for you.
MentalHealthSupport,fpjmqn2,t1_fpi291j,1588674278.0,No it can't just happen there are different ways it can and comes with 3 phases. There are warning signs before psychosis actually happens. The reason I think you should talk it over with a help line even is to stop the anxiety and worry that you have everyday around it so you don't become add to your mental health issues that you are having. Mine was trauma got it 2 year after I left a abusive relationship as I shook off the feelings of what happened. I got psychosis and it lasted for a long time before my meds kicked in. I don't have a psychosis disorder as psychosis itself can happen for many reasons. With psychosis and help and could tell during it what was me been unwell and what was actually happening with help. Schizophrenia you can't tell that you are unwell.
MentalHealthSupport,fpgsxkh,t3_gd1d4s,1588608933.0,Hi sorry nobody replied do know know someone that has such a disorder or is it just complete anxiety around this mental health issue. My aunty has paranoid schizophrenia and I had a psychosis episode 3 years ago. Every different from each other. I had bad anxiety when my episode healed itself with meds and been hospitalised as if it was going to start again. You may want to reach out to a professional to see how to ease this if there consently as it putting you under pressure.
MentalHealthSupport,fp6ntc6,t1_fp671tr,1588355527.0,"See what your options are and go though what you have learned to ease things. Just make sure the people close to you that you have trusted know support with family, friends and professionals help if the days get dim and you need to talk. I have a few friends and are always here and a few family members and for 3 years now I have fully support from professionals as my mental health issues started with psychosis episodes and now I am recently getting help for my borderline personality traits. You know yourself how your feeling always good to add a bit more support in place incase you need it."
MentalHealthSupport,fp642mj,t3_gbflai,1588345686.0,Seems like you mental health struggle has you in auto drive and that it taking away this that make you happy which with mental health can happen my self care and interests are wobbly for the last while since I was so unwell and have traits of borderline personality disorder at first it was excessive anxiety and depressive moods and dissociation but then they added it to traits of this disorder. Would say check in with a professional that you have to make sure you stop it in its tracks incase it worsens. Keep care.
MentalHealthSupport,fp6389z,t3_gbitrc,1588345224.0,So sorry thinking of you and hope things will plan out right for you and your family when this time is over. ‚ù§
MentalHealthSupport,fomy9lz,t3_g7rkuh,1587907458.0,There is a researched disorder ongoing in people who can't get away from fantasy and prefer that over reality but did not read first post to really know what you are going through. I can only say now that I can relate to this in what you posted but I have something called maladaptive daydreaming self diagnosed as not known yet we all are at this stage so maybe looking into it and seeing if it gives you answers hope it does.
MentalHealthSupport,fojc433,t3_g7ojdn,1587816341.0,Oh this is hard always hungry but maybe planning meals that you know you have eating good meals even just organising healthy snacks so it does not lead to overeating all the foods you are aware can be difficult to undo if it reaches of fast weight been put on. I had to go off Olanzapine as my weight was so bad so quickly and my blood work was not good because of my weight gain.
MentalHealthSupport,foakueu,t3_g6esjv,1587648347.0,Hi sounds so like my trauma with my ex it got into a nightmare. No contact with him if possible and to get help sooner rather than later as trauma effects people differently it caused me to have a psychosis breakdown 2 years after I broke it off with him. Look into help lines that can advice you where I am from councilors are free in helping with this sort of trauma so something will be there to help and always is.
Paranormal,fnyw41j,t3_g4hee5,1587377875.0,It scary enough when it happens but can lead it to be scarier if you react to the wrong ghost that is there at the time. One that use to come into my room and sit on my bed and wake me up enough when I was little was the most I have been scared this happened for a while and he or she would like to look at me even doe I never opened my eyes I could tell that a ghost was there it strange sense that you are not alone and you can't hear whatever it is breath and then can tell its not blinking. Another thing that happened footsteps doors banging and on my own in the house I went and checked and Notting. It takes me a few days to come around again and I feel fine again. Sometime been afraid when living with someone gives you peace of mind to go to sleep when others are awake. I haven't seen or heard anything in a long time but if it was trapped and not wanting to go to the afterlife I must have giving it comfort the way I use to think of this to make me believe that it means no harm which makes it easier not to be afraid of such things. Still seen one is different you don't want to move or go away incase it follows you so when that happened to me to stay still observing it somewhat it disappeared when it decided. So we can make sure experience don't get worse if we make the wrong decision and they are happy enough to leave when they know that fear is not going to make things worse for them and us if we react from fear.
Paranormal,fnvjunh,t1_fntmt6l,1587295987.0,Hey yeah that would be I will take you up on that sometime later if you don't mind it's a full house of non believers that like to ground me when I go on about it since I suffer with my mental health somewhat they always worry about me. Did my research you gave me the one where it was on my bed for quiet some time confuses me as the house is very different and each room has change a bit every so often. Even if they where stuck on memory of theirs and it stuck playing over and over again sitting on my bed is ok but noticing me and stay focusing on me for a bit each time is amazing. I remembered a the goosebumps I get every so often here it's a cold house that you get use to but walking around can give a cold vibe in sorting places just a the right times. My house is now part of history as we can do Notting with it and it's up on the history websites of building that can't be touched because of the time line of when it was built and what happened in those times. So the people and the house can be researched online to look into both when I feel up to knowing more if you still are interested I will message you if it's OK and you can start if you are up to it.
Paranormal,fnszxdh,t1_fnsrv0k,1587231976.0,Thanks for sharing your knowledge it helpful as I can't escape things that will bring my experience with them back to me. Interest in why one would watch me sleep for days but saying it would not be around every night and even if I knew it was in the room always at the end of my bed. Maybe he or she knew me or someone that didn't that passed before my parents meet but if not that case that they were living people and someone's loved one might bring into play. Even knowing that I know they are there and as the time went on I could even sleep after a while 0f their presents in a way of thinking if somewhat give them comfort and they haven't hurt me I can try and go back to sleep. I am sure experience like this can not be followed with answers of why they were so calm around me. Thanks again. üòÇ
MentalHealthSupport,fnripi2,t1_fnrfzpa,1587190183.0,She didn't go too into details about it she was left on very little meds while going for ect. Yeah I did didn't fully understand it much had a good group of supportive patients in there. Its good to hear people wanting to find out more about this and work on it properly sorry that you are going through this and that my input is not what you where looking for.
MentalHealthSupport,fnr9uy2,t3_g32att,1587182924.0,I think on my last admission one of my friends I made suffered with this she was in a psychic hospital for 10 weeks on meds before she got moved to the one I was in to get ect done as she said all meds lasted 2 weeks going well she suffered with anxiety and depression too so look up ect and who would be accepted for the treatment I think you have to be fully assessed for it as there is memory loss and forms to be signed everytime before you have it done. It would be worth to see if your research you make you think that it's best of me and see how you get accepted for it so to make sure there is no disappointment. I know it's not done like the old days general antistatic and only done on one side and only for 40 seconds. Not sure of anything else to do with it she use to wake up and be so excited and say she was off for her fry. Seems to be done well haven't talked to her much but glad that she is feeling better. Hope this helps.
MentalHealthSupport,fnr7wet,t3_g3c8r5,1587181495.0,I think that all what you said can be notified as a emergency for your psychiatrist and least get on the phone and go through the points of this difficult time building self worth that you need to put yourself first if possible since you suffer with mental health will benefit you in how much you will heal and know what ways you can cope on bad days with knowing the people that are qualified to help and have your trust are always there for you.
Borderline,fnkfb38,t3_g28tf5,1587024896.0,For me it has been to long and I can't get my mind away from wanting to be intimate with someone. Since professional that help and more added into my life I haven't been able to talk about my sex life and it always is them to say that we need to talk about your abusive ex and how it lead me to go insane to only find out that I was sexually harassed and then raped well they don't say that but the conversation is always why I got psychosis. Even though all of what happened to my and this new diagnosis I have had a mental illness since I was little it called maladaptive daydreaming which is having another world and characters with their own identities that know how to hold onto someone and love them so in a way I always feel what it is like to be with someone. It get lonely sometimes thinking about their lifes are growing more than mine since one of my characters grow with me from the start of this illness. Funny enough I started smoking cause I can not see how I can get out of feeling stuck with this feeling. Plus no professional knows how to deal with my first illness as it is still been researched even so people with it have made websites to talk to others and to not feel so isolated which is comforting.
Selfhealingmadd,fniuurk,t3_g1e5z7,1586986764.0,Hey sorry for only replying now I am not to sure but maybe more or less in what each person would think about in parts of their life's and get time to know what their day brings ahead or think about people they care about for a while. I suppose it depends on where we are in our lives as well to have the chance to think over things for a while. It's normal for our brain that always need a bit of a challenge and it takes us into places where we are unsure when it gets bored so keep that in mind anyway our bored brain will lead us back into our daydreaming. Sorry if this post is not much help.
Borderline,fndin3f,t3_g13zue,1586870863.0,This is a new diagnosis for me and I have caused so much pain on others because of my self destruction behaviour I am only starting my therapy. If you do choose to leave and want a clean break if it's wants best that you decision but if you got to know her well and care maybe keeping a check on her as a friend but it mostly what you would be able for. You have to look after yourself this disorder is really overwhelming in ways for someone with it and others that care as the behaviour we have that causes us to ourselves as it weird way of been in control. I decided to try and ease my self destructive behaviour so that people around me are ok and not always upset and fighting. What I am trying to say she can tell that you are suffering even doe her actions her taking over but if it's that she has not yet been having the proper therapy maybe she needs that so that she can see what actions she needs to take. Everyone's strengths are different in that I haven't even got into how to deal with my destructive part of treatment but I am willing to ease this part to ease the pain it has in others. She will get the help she needs and then be able to cope better with this issue. Hope you are ok been driving some family members half mad as the can't deal with mine so you not alone in not knowing how to help and its effect on you.
Borderline,fnafpli,t1_fna1kfp,1586796699.0,Do you have this disorder or here to get answers about your ex's behaviour if it was her that had it. Ease to give into certain aspects of what is this disorder. Not proud of myself really was brought up to be respectful person I never wanted to be with anyone until my 20's and then it was always the lads the just where at the time in their life's where they didn't want anything meaningful and taught that it would be somewhat fun to be with me since they knew that intimacy was what I was missing in my life. I got over that part as I didn't want people to associate me as s word. My relationships calmed me down a bit in that way. Still a part of self destruction that is on what is this disorder if you research it. Also my suicidal issues. Its weird talking about the fact that in my mind I think too much about sex and what is very worrying is that my therapist has to help me with it oh here I am doomed and not looking forward to that conversation.
MentalHealthSupport,flwvepr,t3_frkhix,1585566713.0,Rant away we all do. It's important that you have someone to listen. I am here.
MentalHealthSupport,fln9mve,t1_fln8mgt,1585313308.0,"I can agree it's hard to let go of someone and to do what right for you and to block her but if you tried a few times you heading the right way. Just don't let the thoughts that things could change if I keep in contact with her get in the way. It will get easier with time when you decide this is whats best.
Thanks things got easier for me with time I hardly think of him and what he did to me. There is no point in looking back and having a pity party for myself it wont do me any good."
MentalHealthSupport,fln7f23,t3_fpvjm1,1585311489.0,"By reading that post it seems like you are a good guy too good and she know this. As much as you care for her you need to think is this healthy for you. The more time you talk to her and know that it is not going to do you any good but make you more and more upset with yourself. I would think there would be only 1 option block her and fully ignore her for your own mental health and the fact that you deserve better. She sounds like a mulipuative person and there is no talking around these people on what you want to know as you said when you tried she played the go easy card on you. The more you talk to her the more you are going to go around in circles as if she is the type of person that I think she is she will keep you where she wants you and loss no sleep.
It take all sort make the world go round and sometimes you meet people and learn that you come first and that when the time comes you will make a place for someone that will try their hardest to make you happy but you need to make space and take time to heal.
Hope this helps I was in a relationship for about 4 years with someone who know how to play me in a mulipaptive way and ended up been a victim of abuse for so long and thought that things would be different but he knew what he was at."

Plus finding a health way to cope and take that time for yourself no matter how little time you have take it and do something that will benefit you and is not harmful.

addiction,f6qv485,t1_f6p10u9,1573086701.0,This is sad for me but true my therapist said I am excellent at escapism which is prob his way to say that I am a addict.

addiction,f6o4ytp,t3_ds5rz3,1573007831.0,"Its rewarding yourself for been in good form I do that with my daydreaming disorder. Happy daydream. so on and so forth. Try and put something in place for yourself that is not harmful and that your mind will be happy with and if you are trying to stop that you are rewarding yourself with. I am starting the gym and swimming saved money for it. Its to put something there for yourself that the addiction side of things will be at ease. Its all about rewiring your mind and is so hard to do so. 

I have maladaptive daydreaming which is an behavioral addiction disorder it may not harm me psychically but it isolates you and give you anxiety and depression which can lead to harmful habits as I now smoke fags because I am fed up of been so isolated. Now I am replacing it with good things and see how it goes."

My parents told me if I do not stop smoking they wonuld kick me out and I have mental health issues so I wouldn't make it on my own. here I am after 2 fags during the night because I woke up needing to go to the toilet and never made it due to me excessive smoking I am doing right now I would say.

Psychosis,f5wv69p,t3_dpfizl,1572531092.0,"I couldn't sleep for days starring at my computer thinking that everyone of fb was cartoon and then my animals at home where been abused and look battered and upset until I began thinking that death was following me around the place waiting for a wrong move and even looking at family until I thought I was death then I taught I was going to kill someone so I tried to kill myself instead until I got out of that false state of mind and cried to my dad to bring me to hospital scared them to keep me in hospital said I was going to hurt one of my family members or myself if they didn't keep me. They kept me there for a night and then I went to a private hospital for 3 months taught I was part of god and no one could harm me. Its so scary I don't want to ever think my mind could bring me there not that I was going to harm anyone but thought that something would happen if my presents was around my family.

Now my psychosis is surreal could walk past a person turn around if I hear them calling my name and then they start verbally abusing me in their own voice not that I am imagining that person. Last time my aunty went on about something that hit me hard and I taught she was crying and then turned to her and she smiled at me then she kept going on with the conversation.  Its freaky and I have a few tricks to make sure my mind is not drifting off to psychosis like getting the person to repeat what they are saying to me if something sounds weird."

Selfhealingmadd,f5tkjlg,t1_f5tdet4,1572460472.0,"I am so sorry that you went through childhood trauma. I went through my own trauma when i was young. Its understandable that your thoughts  in opening up will not make you feel better 100% but I don't think we will get there with all we went through. The important thing with opening up is that you have someone there to be there as much as they can for you. 

I opened up and people just listen and say to that they will always be here for when I need them counselling is good when you need someone to talk to too and its confidently to a certain extent.

The way to go with certain things is to learn how to cope when things get hard that's way we have this disorder to help us cope and not to feel that we are on our own with what we went through. It is a protector in ways which I am glad I have it when I don't know where to go. 

Hopefully the more we learn about this and see whats important and who is important to us in our lives as it goes on our madd will ease off a good bit but for now when we are going through a lot we have a para's and this madd community so we can open up and not to feel alone and down.

MaladaptiveDreaming,f54obh5,t3_ddsu6s,1571987836.0,As I went through a psychotic episode I think his mental health and that where kinda like paranoid schizophrenia as he went into Sophie's apartment if he taught it was real. Might be wrong but I know delusions are not nice and do not focus on the positive well mine where not and focused on me trauma . Its more like hullisonations that he had mostly and his maladaptive daydreaming and what comes with it depression and anxiety. Then again it is a movie and whoever did it up did good but its kind of distressing for me even doe.

Silly thing to do and you are right to do something like that mine is my maladaptive daydreaming to get me away from all the bad in my life but trying to stop that so it leaves me to focus on my emotions which I run away from by daydreaming. 

Really like the way you put this and I count myself lucky but can feel myself getting low again will defo message you for now I am in a bad place with my trauma and don't need to bring people down with me but to open up about it generally.

It all depends on what you are going though I have had anxiety depression and psychosis episodes so they jumped in but not too far to get hurt or hurt our friendships its all about trusting them to know when they have reached their limit on helping and the rest is for you to deal with as no one else can make you feel better at the end of the day as long as you have the proper support in place too to help as well.
Selfhealingmadd,f4mgmue,t1_f4m0a9x,1571678122.0,So happy for you now that its working keep up what you are doing and take the positives you can find in your bad days too even if didn't feel the need to daydream after a few hours and you noticed your hours and coming down a good bit. As I always say here for you if you need to talk. Keep up the good work it should get easier to cope with if you keep going the way you are and the maladaptive habit/disorder will ease too. :) X x
MentalHealthSupport,f4ll7il,t3_dkx7lo,1571668452.0,I made a counselor cry before for me and had one that was very opinionated but that should never bring in any of their religious views into this so yeah a red light. Would you be able to get someone else handy just even mention it to him/her and maybe they will know where they went wrong that is what I would do.
traumatoolbox,f4k6449,t3_dku83a,1571636954.0,"I am so sorry that this happened to you what happened to you was no way your fault and what they did showed that they are sick in some way and I hope that they realize what they had done to you was so so wrong. I am here if you ever ever feel low and don't know who to turn to did you ever tell your mother what happened? Please take care of  trauma can be powerful if we ignore it it can turn its ugly face and show us that its really here. Thank you so much for sharing. 

My trauma was caused because my bf sexually abused me over 4 years I taught it would stop each time it happened but no ended him having sex with me while I was asleep and he owe me 3000 at the end of it all so was abused more than one way. 

please pm me if you need to talk. :) X x"

Selfhealingmadd,f478mjq,t1_f46azku,1571418856.0,"It is and its hard at the start but make little aims for yourself. I aimed to make plans with my friends so its not always them inviting out so I am going to a concert with them after Christmas and going on a 5k with them. The more things you do the more you build on your interests with them and it get easier. 

Yeah our daydreaming life is so better but I am enjoying been with people and its giving a rush for life in a way which is good. I don't like social situations too as I can't control if I something goes wrong but I laugh off my mistakes with them. If you ever feel like this site is lonely I have another one that is busier. Will add it into this site for ye.

 Always here if you feel lonely and need to talk. :)"
depressed,f3xwky1,t1_f3ucgjt,1571245060.0,My subreddit is selfhealingmadd. Its for people who have a daydreaming disorder and need support to ease it. People with this issues feel depressed at times as its a lonely issues and I made this so they have someone to talk to and feel like they are not alone if their depression is popping up so that way I joined here too add it to my subreddit so they have somewhere to go if they are feeling down.
MentalHealthSupport,f3s4tan,t3_dhywx5,1571096976.0,"Don't put it in your head that this rough patch will be over after so long but don't think I am saying that this suffering is going to last for another while. It took me over to years to get though mine it all depends on what we went though and to be able to come here and share is good. Keep opening up do things that relax you maybe start doing some mindfulness something that will ease what you are going though when it happens. Sounds like you are ruminating and letting it fester when your get up and go is down. But well all have does days is its normal when you have a mental health issue or your mental state is low. If someone say you are lazy or jumping on the depression bandwagon your not no one that has been though any issues with their mental health would even think that. 

Even start by going for a 5 minute walk let the air hit you and see if you can think of something positive that you have in your life like when I am down and depressed I will go out and listen to my music and relax and then I will think of something nice I can do for myself like take a long shower or pick up the phone and catch up with one of my friends and see whats going on in their lives. give yourself those few minutes to be anxious and think why find that is its important to not to ignore it."
depressed,f3s2hah,t3_dhwd2z,1571095896.0,"Oh I am listen and here and its not another year of wasted life. Its a year that you got though and where strong and are here to open up to people that know what you are going though. I don't have depression but have a subreddit that needs help with it if you want you can help me out by talking to me subreddit memebers when they are down. No the professionals are there for all of us and I have 3 at the moment all I do is talk and talk about my issues and that is what their job is to listen and help me though my trauma, and my suicidal state of mind that I was in 2 years ago. I always think to myself who is here for me and who am I here for in my life. Do the things you want never let yourself think that you can't this world has a whole lot of us to see and what we want to know about it and it amazing in what you will find that will but a smile to your face or who you may meet along that way that will put a smile on your face. Give your a few aims to work towards and look forward to if you can focus on any  look after number one and make sure you have someone to talk to you can always pm me if you need someone to talk to and thanks for sharing."
MentalHealthSupport,f3rxc8l,t1_f3p2br0,1571093471.0,"Its good that it came natural to you its shows part of your personality. Don't look for a sorry look at what you did for her and him and pat yourself on the back and say to yourself that you did well. Take in all the positives of that situation that you saved a life and one that needed someone to get her out of it in her mental state that was crying out for someone she trusted to help her he is probably upset and in shock that it wasn't him to so that is understandable and when you go in and if big if he talks to you and get angry about say that she is well and here with ye and that is whats important and see if he need reassurance. Seem like he wanted to be the bigger guy and that is normal.   Be the stronger person if you think you can if not you see all the things that can be effected by not going into work your anxiety will get the better of you and in a way it was a mild trauma ye went though as you did not know what to expect. I am always here I am still getting help for mine and my trauma I went though. Do something nice for yourself and things that relaxes you too. :) X x

P.s I think all the anxiety you are going though now and the paranoia is normal mind yourself like I said pm me anytime you need to talk some more if you think I can help."
MentalHealthSupport,f3odq7q,t3_dhgn90,1571015157.0,"First thing well done I want to give you a hug you did so well in making sure you dealt with this and its not something anyone would think that they would have to do for someone in the way that this type of situation would come to you to deal with but you did. X x 

You did noting wrong don't mind her bf he was just panicking or maybe you learned something about his personality when things don't go well for him that is his problem doe not yours. I have anxiety too and it s hard to switch off do you get help for anxiety or did it get like a stronger feeling that you haven't felt before 

I was suicidal and it was scary my mind was in a trace state when I went though it and I did come out of it lucky enough but anything happened but I didn't give anyone a warning as it came on strong and I was going to commit it at the moment when I didn't feel ok so I appreciate what you did for your friend . Plus it shows how much she wanted you to be there for her.  

If you need to talk some more pm me and let us know how you got on in work if you went. IF not yeah pm me and I can talk to you some more about this."

here is my subreddit  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Selfhealingmadd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selfhealingmadd/) 

Here is the other forum I moderate  [http://daydreaminblue.freeforums.net/](http://daydreaminblue.freeforums.net/) 

All my threads that I made are a bit overwhelming and see like I am focused on too much but the more your mind gets use to doing these thing it doesn't faze me as much anymore.  

Hope to here from you. :)"

I think its important that you don't pick up a harmful escape mechanism I am sure you are aware of the importance of not replacing the daydream to a harmful one. 

Always here to help. :)"

Selfhealingmadd,f3ekjzh,t1_f3ei4b1,1570881045.0,"Hey this emptiness and loneliness is going to happen but like you say you daydream of people in your real life so if they are not strangers work on those friendships and if there is something that is getting in the way of that maybe start small and work your way up have an aim for yourself to build on your social self now that you are looking on the positives well done so happy for you 

Try not to focus to much on giving it up totally and look at what you learn about yourself when you daydream and how you feel before the daydreaming starts and what it is you daydream about it will come easier to you to know what it is you are seeking in your life. 

Having a lot of time and not been able to bring joy in doing things was normal I think after you see your madd easing. I took up a new interest as I found my mind needed to be challenged to become interest in something as are daydreams have no limits it hard to find the right interest to keep my mind happy. I play chess now which is good. 

It seem like you have this and I am always here if you need to talk though anything."

Keep talking it out to people if it gets brushed off thats there problem its important for people to know how you are in case thing deteriorate for you and then they will have a good bit of understanding when you need it most. I talk too much and it gets brushed off from time to time but when my mental state went bad they took it all seriously it doesn't mean that its going to happen to you or anyone and thats the way too look at it its just a way of making people aware of how you are and keeping it in mind."

The way you are coping need to be taking with care you are doing the right thing in looking to seek help and advice where you can do not loss hope or give in. Yes I agree go to the hospital For people to take me seriously when I was in a bad way I said that I taught something bad was going to happen to me I put pressure on the system but my mental state was dropping and I was scared plus I went through psychosis so don't know have the things I said to make sure I was taking seriously. 

I was raped so if you need someone to relate to at any stage I am here. I have started smoking because of it and all my family say its an excuse to do so which is hard to hear.

 meditation is brill to keep in the present I would recommend the app Stop, Breathe, and Think. It goes through how you are physically and mentally feeling and then through your emotions at that time and then it gives you options. 

Thanks I started off small at the beginning this will be a big one of me but to achieve it and see how I feel after it will be worth it.  Take care. :)"

I might be wrong I suffer with depression mood anxiety and psychosis so they can link each other with their symptoms but I know as I reserch everything as such that it sounds like your meds need to be checked I am on the right meds for me and I don't get these taughts anymore.

As I say to people what other way would you have as if to say get use to it its me. I had so many things been said to me when I was in school I hated it and the more I taught about it I hated myself.

Recently I was daydreaming about him for a while then I realized he is engaged so it stopped my dreaming was disappointed for a while. I think we get so connected to the daydreams we make up even if they are about people we know and something crushes them it is like losing that connection that we made. 

I told myself not to do this anymore I have made a character that I have a family with and that so I always go back to there but I won't get anywhere in that aspect of my life daydreaming away about something that might never happen. 

You said you are in a relationship I think it is normal for us daydreamers to daydream about other crushes even doe we are in a relationship. I won't worry to much the feeling you have because of these connections with you daydreams will pass. When you have plans get out a distract yourself away from daydreaming and thinking about things that might be playing on your mind."
