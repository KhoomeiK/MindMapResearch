""I'm scared of cars because I was in an accident"" ""Well it probably won't happen again!""

""I'm scared of being in an abusive relationship because it was terrifying"" ""Well it probably won't happen again!""

People who say things like that literally don't know what to say in response to a trauma. It is naive at best, painfully ignorant at worst. If this came from someone on the street or an associate, it could be brushed aside. From a therapist, that is not a helpful notion to entertain, express or repeat. 

Traumas repeat themselves all the time. The world is a shit place. To say otherwise is to live in blissful ignorance. People like that, who believe it won't or can't happen again, always get the worst of it if/when it does. 

I've had a few bad therapists (""Have you tried just ignoring your alters so they go away?"") and even worse doctors. I even worked in the medical industry in a way at one time, and there is an incredible amount of incapable people alongside those with god complexes. You know the type. Those that can 'fix the world'. Problem is, therapists don't fix people. People fix people. Therapists are there as support.

I'm glad you're not seeing her anymore. It took me 15 years to find a reasonable medical doctor, and I've yet to find a therapist long-term. It's frustrating for sure. For a profession that means to help people, there sure are a lot of them that aren't very good at it."
work,fqmgr45,t3_gjocnd,1589477182.0,"I worked for a boss that was 92. You heard right. He would come in every day, at 92, and put in his eight hours. He was still pretty sharp when I started, but about a year in, I suspected he was developing dementia or had a series of mini strokes that were affecting his ability to remember things at work. 

What I learned from the situation:

1. Even if you go to the family, there is a chance you will become a target. Family does not always appreciate 'outside help', and the louder your concern, the bigger the moves are to stop you from rocking the boat. 
2. The only solutions are: He stays and continues to degrade, or he gets removed from his position. Neither of which you want to be responsible for. 
3. You need to look out for you. You can have a heart of *gold* but business is business. Nobody is going to look out for your wellbeing in all of this except *you.*
4. Start looking at other opportunities if actions aren't being taken to resolve this issue by the family, management or business. Because if you aren't a partner or next in line for his position, you are not directly involved. 
5. Be safe. Memory degradation happens fast. It did with my grandmother, resulting in a hostage situation with a knife. And it did with my former 92 boss mentioned here, where he now has several pending lawsuits for violently attacking employees and even trying to throw one of them off the work balcony (which happened only two months after I left)

It really really sucks. But, the options for this type of thing are very minimal. Even moreso when you aren't related to the person in question. Keep your head down, start keeping detailed notes on the situation, email them to a private email so you always have a paper trail to cover your ass about whats going on and figure out a game plan for your next few months to a year."

In business, confrontations were a necessity at times. Or, at least, fully standing up for yourself. And I would just crumble. She popped in one day and showed me how it's done. I felt like she was me, if I had my shit together, haha. She would front for me 90% of the workday. I am super fortunate to have worked at that time with someone who also had DID, and we all worked very well together.

I often felt inspiration to be more like her as time went on, and I think she was a result of manifesting an 'ideal work identity'.

I'm not vanilla by any means and have my own kinks, but I will weigh in that sexual compatability is a huge part of a relationship. If he is pushing for anal, even trying to train you, and you aren't sure about it... then look at this critically:

Will you be into exclusively anal, going forward?

Have you taken up training for anal, and enjoyed it?

Is it something you genuinely want to do?

In the end, for me, I was willing to try but it wasn't enough to satisfy my partner. What he needed got more and more intense. What I was being asked to do was more and more to meet his needs, not mine. 

Look seriously at this. You both need to be happy in the bedroom. If he has a fetish and he satisfies it in his own way, without being injurious to you or your relationship, hey thats cool. However, grooming you to satisfy his needs is not okay. You both need to be on the same page or there will be a slow building of resentment over time.

Took 7 years for my ex to admit he wasn't happy and had found scat partners on the side. He wanted extreme anal play. He found a new partner, we broke up and it was a benefit to both of us in the end.

BDSMAdvice,fp02di3,t3_gae2gm,1588201188.0,"Anything related to any type of breath play needs to have much more communication and safety measures than you are currently implementing. That point has been raised multiple times here, which you have confirmed you were unable to communicate in a way to withdraw consent. 

Some people believe they don't need a safe word. There are also people in the world that believe they don't need a seatbelt because they are a good driver. You don't need one... until you do. By then, it's too late. Please reassess your safety going forward, with any partner or scene. You were ball-gagged, then face-sitting and chest-sitting? I got anxious just reading that, OP. That could have gone so badly. 

Onto the other points, realize that a submissive has more power than the dom. *You* are giving *them* permission to take a leading role in play. If something is introduced without discussion, confirmation of consent and active happy safe participation, that is **full stop.** 

What I am reading into here is that your partner somehow told this other person they can participate and doesn't want to disappoint them. So instead, they are trying to bully you into 'letting' them have their fun with you. That is not how this works. 

If she is insisting you sit down and talk to both of them, that is also a tactic to try and bully you into accepting. Is this other person in a relationship or partnership with **both** of you? If not, then they should not be privy to that meeting. 

I get the vibe that your partner is taking things too far and is losing touch with the fact your needs are just as valid as theirs. You can be a *sub* without being *used.* 

If your wife still objects, then she needs to explain her reasoning as to why this other person must be involved in your play. She cannot just say you are overreacting. She needs to explain why this is so important to her, to the point she is overriding your objections. If she cannot give a good enough reason, then retract your participation until further notice. You need to trust your partner completely when you are in such a vulnerable state. If they violate that understanding, then for your safety (emotionally, physically and mentally), you need to consider stopping play until mutual understanding can be met (both verbally and through actions later).

If you do decide to play going forward, keep one hand free. Do not ball gag. Be able to get **out** of the scene if it continues to violate your comfort zones."

work,fos81ar,t3_g92dja,1588025651.0,"Okay. I am going to weigh in and say that I used to be this employee many years ago. Here is what eventually snapped me out of these behaviors:

1. A one-on-one meeting. Say exactly what you did here. ""You overpromise and underdeliver. I'm not sure if you think that's what I want to hear, but your work should speak for itself. I genuinely want to know: Why do you think that is?"" As uncomfortable as it is to have this conversation, this shows you are aware of what's going on, how they're letting you down, and you're giving them a platform to explain it.
2. Call them once a day about something. Anything. Something simple. Something detailed. A random question. I wouldn't classify this as micromanaging, but it keeps tabs on them. I have a manager that naturally does this with anyone, and I found that even one phone call could remind me of things I'd forgotten to do (even unintentionally)
3. Call him out on not answering emails. Start sending Read Receipts.
4. Talk to management about screen-sharing. A way to log-in to his computer and see what he is doing. Just randomly. If this is something within your company's power, bring it up at a meeting. If he is being this lax, it may be that he is off-topic with his work.
5. Ask him to do a specific task for you. It could be big, or little. But, direct it only to him. This can help put some onus on him that can't be deflected to the team.
6. As a last resort, use the phrase: ""Do you even want to be here?"" I had this one used on me once (although this boss was crazy and it was unwarranted). It's not a threat. It's literally a question. Does he want to be there? Does he want to be in another position? Does he hate his work? Is he bored? Is he frustrated? Does he understand his role? How has his training gone? When was his last performance review?

In the end, some people won't step up. It happens. All you can do is pitch them things they should be able to knock out of the park. After that, it's up to them to step up. If they don't, then perhaps they aren't a fit for your team."

I had to constantly tell them I cannot do hormonal birth controls due to cluster migraines. They tried to suggest a IUD but I refused, citing the fact I already experience pain with another condition and do not want more cramps. 

Explaining exactly what I wanted, and what it was,and how it goes down, they believed I did my research. 

I had to have a history of pelvic exams going back 4 years. I had to be negative on all pap smears. I needed to have that history, but didnt have to do additional exams. I voluntarily went for an ultrasound, as I have fibroids, to confirm none of them would impact surgery. I also have to be in remission with my autoimmune condition, which was the hardest part. And still is. I cant relapse around the time of my surgery due to increased risks, but that's just my case.

I have to get bloodwork done 48hrs before to confirm I'm not pregnant, and I need to know my exact cycle (which I do anyway as I track my cycle as a measure of birth control).

Avoid the 'negativity sandwich', which is where you try to buffer how 'harsh' things are. Focus on the first opening line or two. They should set the tone.

There are many facets to everyone's lives. It's important to communicate at points like these. If a person is a healthy, non-immunocompromised person with no at-risk family members, then they are more likely to be prospected for the work that needs to be done. That's just logical.

microdosing,fo8177n,t3_g6609r,1587588083.0,"I held off on a macro dose for years because I wasn't ready. If you feel yourself resisting, then it's okay. You don't have to.

I used to be afraid too. Hell, I didn't try weed until I was 30 years old. No, really! I have major anxiety issues, and control issues. It took a lot of work to develop a foundation where I could trust myself in those situations.

A big thing I did was to start thinking of things in terms of game plans. Everything I do in my life is part of a plan. Maybe it's a plan for just the day. Maybe its just a plan for a to-do list. But I started breaking things down into plans, which gave me confidence to both set myself up for success, and to feel failure when I didn't meet goals.

With that element of acceptance, a macro dose no longer felt so daunting. I'll go in with the game plan of giving up control, sitting on my couch, watching some pre-loaded videos with music. If it turns into something else, then I'll breathe through it, remind myself that it ends, and continue to just 'go with the flow'.

I basically check-in with myself this way:

Am I calm enough to meditation or do yoga without anxiety? Do I feel good? Do I have plenty of time? Is everything that I need to get done finished? If I can answer all those with positivity, then I may be in a good frame of mind for a macro dose.

However, everyone is different. You know yourself best. Trust your gut. If you're anxious or unsure, take your time. There's no need to rush into a macro dose if you don't feel ready. And that's okay."

Honestly? I love it. I worked from home for two weeks and got so frustrated by the limitations. I volunteered to go in.

When I talk to everyone else that is home with kids, they literally sound miserable. The bosses are pissed because productivity has gone down for everyone across the board with kids. Projects are being pushed through and it's super stressful because we can't always reach the phones of those with kids.

I understand your frustration for sure. I want to be home too. I'm essential, so the only time I worked from home was after a co-worker was sick and we were all waiting for their results. But, honestly, employers are kind of stuck right now too. No daycare, no school? Fuck. The whole situation is a mess.

The truth is, equality is a shame. Nothing will ever be equal. We are the child-free, the rebels of society. If that means I get a better performance review because I can actually do my goddamn work and meet deadlines, then you bet your ass I'm recording that for the purpose of future promotions and performance reviews.

Do what you can. Knock it out of the park. Own it.

Edit: On that note, get these matters in writing if you can. Emails work. Now is the time to clarify what type of hazard pay is being applied, what policies are changing, how this will impact your future negotiation powers for raises, etc. Find out how they are validating productivity during these times, and what impact that will have.

Employers don't have an easy time right now, but this is the time to verify aspects of expectation. Are you taking on more work? Great. Time to talk pay, hazard pay and future pay. If you're taking on an extra 25% due to homebound families, then you're the one saving the company. Now how does that 25% increase in workload translate to your financial and title rank within the company?"

You can see how this is unhealthy and downright dangerous.

You probably know deep down that this isn't okay, and we are here to support and back you. You are right. This isn't right. You don't know how to react because it is illogical, dangerous and you already said you can't go through it again. You are right to feel this way. That is exactly how you should feel.

Are you safe? Do you have a place away from your dom? If this is occurring in a lockdown situation, you can get help to get you to safety.

It is time to do what you need to do to get yourself out of this situation. A dom that loves and respects you will always play within your boundaries, be able to talk about things, and work towards a common goal of meeting the needs of *both / all* parties. What I read here makes me genuinely worry for your safety with this person.

They are not a dom. They are a wanna-be control freak, only willing to meet their own needs while disrespecting your emotions, boundaries and threatening you when you object. That's not right, at all."

I agree with the other comment here about meditation. Allow yourself to practice, even experience these enjoyable moments, but with it must come practice and discipline to keep it to a set time.

You are giving yourself a dopamine fix. You are releasing happy feel-good chemicals by indulging in these fantasies. The same fix that can become addictive. Just like wine to some is a glass of enjoyment, or a whole bottle. A game of cards is enough for one, but not for a gambler who needs more, more, more. The difference between a pint with the boys versus a night of drinking on Tuesday.

Addictive habits come in many forms. Good for you for realizing this is an indulgent behaviour.

Reality is hard. We enjoy escapism. Obviously! Who wants to sit and study when I could be writing the next chapter of my novel in my head? When I could be fantasizing about my garden plans? Oooo what kind of renovations should I do next year?

Here is what I would do, and have done:

1. Recognize the loop. It's okay to look at it, then go back to what you are doing. Do not reward the habit if it is an improper time to do so.
2. Set a specific time for yourself, including a timer, where you can have this as a choice / hobby time.
3. Rebuild your dopamine reflex. 25 minutes of focus, 5 minutes of reward. Set timers. A reward could be getting a snack after studying. Set up the snack. Maybe a sandwich? Set it aside. Now, go do 25 minutes of work. It doesn't have to be perfect. You're starting. Do 25 minutes of the best you can (even if it sucks! Even if its not your best work!) When that timer goes off, give yourself the reward. You are *literally* training yourself. Once 5 minutes are up, go do another 25 minutes, and so forth.
4. Studying or productivity should have assigned times, slots or days. This gives you structure to build your day. Be gentle when you start. Be kind to yourself. But, be diligent. Only action will get you to where you want to be in reality. Daydreaming is nice, but does *nothing.*

Disassociation is easy. Find a balance between the two (reality and detachment from reality) that moves you into better places without holding your mind and imagination hostage in *hopes* of better things later."

ManagedByNarcissists,fnqd5ec,t3_g2r3q2,1587162277.0,"Network with everyone else around you. Build a rapport with others, in a genuine fashion. You cannot fight directly, so fight indirectly. 

My direct supervisor is a narc. I basically operate as an assistant between four different departments. So she not only outranks me, but can directly affect my relationship with others by how she talks about me. 

I was about to throw in the towel about a month ago because the attacks were so bad. However, networking saved me. I read 'How to Win Friends and Influence People', then listened to a variety of talks on hostage situations. Using both, I built relationships everywhere I could. Genuine. Not pandering. I was building my safety net through others. 

If you grey rock, they will sometimes increase tactics as well. You aren't playing the game. So they'll try harder to get you to either play, or punish you for not playing. Build a support net around you instead. Honestly, hostage negotiation tactics helped me communicate with my narc. It was amazing. 

Another thing to do when someone outranks you, is to track your daily tasks. Take notes on an email. Send it to yourself at the end of the day. Timestamps don't lie, and it's one way I've covered my ass. Another thing is that it becomes searchable if an issue ever comes up where you need to cover your ass. 

Depending on your situation, don't be afraid to stand up in public situations with lots of witnesses to set them up to agree with you. If you know 100% that you can win at something, and you are willing to play the game a bit, and you have witnesses that outrank her, stand your ground. 

At first, it will bring hell down on you. But, when narcs get angry, they make mistakes. They don't like to make mistakes in front of others. I like to set my narc up to agree with ideas in front of others, because there's witnesses and critiquing a good idea only gets negative attention on them. 

It's a game. It's all a game. Once you realize this, you can start to play. Change the rules. Break them. Play dirty. Always cover your ass. Always protect yourself. Lean into the element of danger when the opportunity arises. If she's after you, and you start to grey rock and back down, it can get much more intense. Because she's about to *win.* So either make it painful for her to win, or remove her ability to do so at every opportunity."
