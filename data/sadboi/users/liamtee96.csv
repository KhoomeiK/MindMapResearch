Anxiety,fiq9d4r,t3_f8xi8b,1582638837.0,"I‚Äôve always avoided doing this as I‚Äôm incredibly nervous about this. I always overthink and don‚Äôt make I contact with women in this manner. I overthink and rush to the worst conclusions, I keep thinking that women would think I‚Äôm a pervert or something it‚Äôs kinda like intrusive thoughts/thinking the worst. Any advice folks?"
introvert,fdqoktb,t3_emqia3,1578671501.0,I just keep my head down or sometimes just avoid looking at people like reading a sign or store products or something so I don‚Äôt have to look at people
introvert,fdqohnd,t1_fdqmeuw,1578671445.0,Personally I always try to get a seat near a window to look out of so I don‚Äôt have to look at people. Last month I was on a bus surrounded by people and I had a newspaper it was very useful as I enjoyed reading it but it also allowed me to avoid contact. Dunno if this helps or not haha
AnxietyDepression,fdmte05,t3_em1nq2,1578564873.0,Oh yeah. Makes me reassure myself that I‚Äôm not normal and for me to give up trying to find a relationship . Allot of my friends and those in my family my age are in relationships. I‚Äôve never been in one and I‚Äôm starting to realise that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be in one.

There‚Äôs also speech writing programs like Dragon available which may help you. I used Dragon allot when making notes and all you do is speak into a headset and then it puts your speech into typed words."
depression,ez3rtca,t3_czy6ax,1567673715.0,I find that having something to distract myself from ruminating is very useful. Particularly subtitled TV works as I just focus on reading the words and can‚Äôt ruminate or over think things. I agree that television helps depressive thoughts.
