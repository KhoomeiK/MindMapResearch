Brampton,fprhhs6,t1_fprfs27,1588854267.0,"That is a violation. A home in Brampton cannot have more than 2 partitioned units, think upstairs and basement. Most basements have to do a lot of retrofitting before they would be considered legal and up to code (Making windows bigger, door in certain areas, etc.). Unfortunately the inspections let a lot of stuff go due to the need for affordable housing in the GTA."
Brampton,fpns4v4,t3_gejcwj,1588771397.0,"I think we are too far gone, unfortunately. My biggest problem with Brampton is that affordable housing in the city that is meant for young families that bring that sense of community here are being gobbled up by slum lords who turn their homes into rooming housing. This was just usually isolated by Sheridan but has since expanded to all over. Often these homes are overcrowded and unkept as there is no sense of ownership."
