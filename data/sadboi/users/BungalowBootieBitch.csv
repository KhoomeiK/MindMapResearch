90DayFiance,fr3fye3,t1_fr3fffv,1589856576.0,"It's a lot of things. I think it's unfair that she uses his former addiction as a reason to never trust him. She also jumped the gun about moving to Africa which wouldn't be a problem if it was just her, but she involved Daniel too. Daniel adores Ronald and Ronald wants to be his dad. If they didn't stay together, it probably mess Daniel up. Then last minute she decided Africa wasn't her cup of tea after she got pregnant. It was a lot decisions made without really thinking of the consequences. I also don't think she realizes how difficult it is for foreigners to get visas. They aren't the only ones trying to get one."

I didn't play sims 1 or 2 except on the psp. I played Sims 3 with only world adventures and supernatural. Up until yesterday, I thought Murphy beds were a brand new item in Sims 4. Then I see they were in past games already. I only know EA is ripping us off because of Plumbella, Carmen King, and this subreddit. If brand new players don't know what $40 used to get a player, they'll think what is provided is the norm. I'm going to get eco living, but when it's on sale."
