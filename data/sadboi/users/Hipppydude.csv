socialskills,fl6evyh,t1_fl6dw9d,1584865688.0,"Exactly and that's why I tried to specify most because my therapist very much worked by a book with numbers and research towards males that refused to put in any effort. (my chore on the minimum effort chart was waking up 1hr early to sweet and mop the floors as I left out the front door, leaving a sticky note on the mop teasing about ""ha, now you have to find something else to do for the next hour, maybe <insert idea like coffee with so and so friend, checking with said friend ahead of time but not making certain plans)  I'm just a random dude throwing out what I've learned and applied to my life and as a dude who since a teen was told to ""be more aggressive"" from girls I dated, I thought that meant to be controlling, which was obviously sooo wrong but from the environment I was in, it made sense.

To the outliers in my numbers I am so sorry, I could easily upend everything here by telling someone they can turn a woman on just by honking at her while she walks down the road and sure 99% of woman might hate it but I happen to know a few woman who get disappointed if somebody doesn't honk. So I have to work with the numbers and what I know. Please feel free to correct and add any info because if I know anything, ITS THAT I KNOW NOTHING"

socialskills,fl6eeqs,t1_fl6cn9y,1584865065.0,"You'll never get this to the top because to many of us dudes and I say us because I am very much a part of this (I dropped 50lbs in the last year just because I realized my unhappiness and loneliness came from a lack of self confidence fueled and protected by alcoholism and isolation. I did this and changed things for myself to feel more attractive and know how to handle my future relationships better, call it vane but it worked) will never want to face this. It's not because we don't want to but it's because we will try to make some kind of logical sense of it, even while knowing that we will never ""get"" it.

I have another good tip of something that at makes no sense to dudes but just needs the right metaphor to crossover. I used to get insecure as a teen about many things and sometimes I would think my girlfriend was cheating on me simply because she would put on makeup before going to the convenient store, which seemed to me like something simple that nobody needed makeup for. I mean duh, i only needed a tshirt, pants, shoes, and my baseball cap. Even though I was a dumb teenager I was smart enough to know that I didn't know everything so I asked my girlfriends mother one night before me and my girlfriend went out on a date. It went a lot like this.

Hippy: Hey, Ms. M, I know women use makeup and enjoy it. I just don't get why they feel like they have to wear it down to the convenient store just to grab a soda in the evening when they look so beautiful just chilling without the makeup anyways?

Ms. S: Hippy, you have a hat on your head right? I've never seen you without it unless the girls are teasing you and steal it so you will chase them, right? You probably make sure to have it on every time before you go outside?

Hippy: Yes Ma'am.

Ms. S: There you go. My daughter and other girls makeup are a reflection of how they see themselves.  They wear it like an accessory the same as you do your hat. Yes, they know they are beautiful sitting at home in sweatpants but sometimes a woman wants to put on  makeup the way a man wants to put gel in his hair to style it. Nobody is lying, and yes sometimes we might be out to show off for someone but even if that is the case then it is beyond your control. Do what you can and know who you are so you can feel secure within your place."

socialskills,fl6b3zx,t3_fmukfo,1584861050.0,"My therapist explained it like this to me. When it comes to men, sex is logical, I'm horny so lets fuck. When it comes to (most?) women things are totally different. They love foreplay and need it to get interested and ultimately off because sex is so much more mental for them. When it comes to get laid as a man you have to remember 1 rule, foreplay starts in the morning with things like a good morning message, an act of kindness, a good gesture, helping out without having to be asked, leaving a sweet note on the pillow next to her if you leave for work before she wakes. There are literally unlimited ideas in these areas but so many fail to ever try and take advantage to them and then wonder why she didn't want to have sex after you interrupted the video she was watching by trying to slobber all over her face at 9pm after she already decided at 3pm that you weren't interested because you never bothered to tell her at any point during the day that you were thinking of her or that she mattered. It takes effort and if that's to hard for somebody then they need to find somebody more compatible.
