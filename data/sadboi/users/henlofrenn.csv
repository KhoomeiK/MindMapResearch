She's aware of her BS and simply doesn't feel like doing anything about it so, based on all the comments, it's pointless to try and reason with her; I should just avoid her whenever I can and stay neutral when we have to interact"

Yeah, I do my best to stay respectful. I stopped trying to point out things to improve (because, fun fact, she has asked me for constructive feedback before yet refuses to acknowledge what I say hmm). Yep this is a lost cause, I'm moving on to more giraffe facts"

Wow thanks, that's really mind-blowing! Gotta love the ""in the flesh"" pun hehe

I'm pretty sure she does it to others as well. I know for a fact that there's another co-worker who almost always snaps at her, a few others don't really like working with her, and some of our clients can even be mean to her yet change their attitude with other people, so I guess there's a pattern there? 

Again, when confronted about it, she implied that she didn't want to improve so I guess she has kind of ""embraced"" it in a sense...

Another ironic detail: we work in communications"
CasualConversation,etf38al,t1_etf2w8g,1562758520.0,">fun giraffe facts

Let's cry together

It's mainly critical thinking opinions. This is the stuff she repeated this morning and that pushed me over the edge:
1. Just because you behave a certain way and it's normal and intuitive to you, it doesn't mean it's the case for everyone;
2. Don't be fooled if someone suddenly changes their behavior, it may not last long and they'll probably go back to their own ways, so don't take it for granted.

She literally does that shit and I explain to her, with examples, why you should always be skeptical, because she's super naive, and it's funny because she's 14 years older than I am :')"
CasualConversation,etf247e,t1_etf1u1k,1562757339.0,"Jeez I bet that was infuriating! You're right, since she doesn't want to work on it, I'll just avoid her and not let it get to me as much anymore"

I used to laugh about it a year ago but now it's irritating because it just keeps happening on a regular basis. I'm sorry if I sound whiny, it's just that I like her and this is making it hard to talk to her...
I could see it from another perspective, as in she has retained what I was trying to explain to her to the point of making it her own?"

Well it was a bit tricky to stay consistent because I didn't see it coming so it gave me a panic attack and I got confused, but having already done it before, I wasn't as afraid because I sort of had an idea about the outcome; it wasn't 100% unknown like the first time.

I knew that I just had to push through, that I would feel better later and that the automatic guilt feeling was going to fade away, and it did!

Now I'm the process of ""re-conditioning"" myself to no longer feel guilty for protecting myself from my parents' toxic behavior and projecting that on everybody else around me, including other family members."

He calmed down and didn't call or bring it up again so I hope that means he understood. He texted me the other night saying that my uncle was hospitalized, I said I was going to visit. I expected him to call but he just sent me pictures of the cat at home. I don't know what it means but I'm done trying to decipher his cryptic moves, so I'll just stay neutral.

Things were good for a while because I wasn't talking to my mother, but as soon as I started doing that and openly discussed it with him, he went back to his old ways. So, basically, things were only good because I was doing what he wanted, but I can't allow him to control me any longer.

Today he said : ""if you wanna talk to her or see her, go do it without me knowing, I don't wanna hear about it"". There is still a form of control in there in a way that I can't just freely do what I want but I have to look over my shoulder and make sure he doesn't know, but at least there's a silver lining in there.

I can reduce contact but even if I cut it off, he will not leave me alone until I talk to him and it's frustrating. I feel stuck!

I live a quiet life and I don't want that ruined too. If I knew what to do, I wouldn't have spent 1h20min writing all of this..."
