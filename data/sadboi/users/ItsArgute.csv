BlackPeopleTwitter,fprdb3t,t1_fpqt1xm,1588850894.0,"We try to but movements like black lives matter and such are usually canceled out and demonized by our right wingers as violent or radical, and they created campaigns like all lives matter or blue lives matter to take traction away from the original movement. But you know, we go a president who called tiki torch white nationalists “very fine people” so I mean.

I don’t support Stalin but you say that the Bible doesn’t have a large amount of brutality and bodies is kinda laughable, especially when a lot of the stories in the Old Testament have violence and blood in them."

ptsd,fl5rb8v,t1_fl4n14v,1584843712.0,"I'm trying so hard to let it go but sometimes it definitely feels like all I've left around me is destruction, and that me and my constantly changing moods just fuck up everything. I've been working so hard for so long and I'm still having nightmares, I'm still seeing faces, I'm still replaying all those memories in my head and I can't stop. It just continues to get worse."
ptsd,fl2fvpy,t3_fly9i5,1584750075.0,"I needed this. Feels like sometimes I’m stuck between trying to hold on to my pre-PTSD life and trying to move forward. I wanna get new faces around me but it’s hard because I feel like no matter what, if I even begin to show that side of myself, people drop me and avoid me. It’s hard being 18 and trying to find other guys who even begin to understand how much of a hell my head constantly is, or understand that me succumbing to my feelings at times doesn’t make me less of a “man.”"

Much love, glad you're doing it on your terms now. You'll get through this and the next chapter will be even better. Get yourself right first."
