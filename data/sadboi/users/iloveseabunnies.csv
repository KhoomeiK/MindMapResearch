SSRIs,fhaxuks,t3_f28d12,1581430001.0,Yup I got those when tapering down from lexapro 20 mg. But I've been done with the tapering process for about two or three weeks now and I feel better. But I still get these fluttery things in my chest and I also get surprised or startled by EVERYTHING.
SSRIs,ffgwguy,t3_etg40q,1579916816.0,Congrats. I‚Äôm just about done tapering my lexapro and I‚Äôm so excited. When I first tapered I did it too fast and had a lot of awful physical and emotional side effects then I did it correctly. My therapist keeps trying to convince me to go on another but I will NEVER do that again. Especially with how hard it is to get off them.
Anxiety,fci5pq9,t3_eh29dj,1577658074.0,Me when I make mistakes but at the same time I‚Äôm so unsure of myself that I can‚Äôt tell if what I do is a mistake or not. Like even just standing up for myself or talking about my feelings is hard because I‚Äôm so scared that it‚Äôll upset someone or someone won‚Äôt want to hear it. It‚Äôs really tough to go through daily.
AmItheAsshole,fci2mgo,t3_eh4q3d,1577657006.0,Not enough info. Why would your parents just give you a cheap phone case and buy your sister a whole car? Your parents would just about have to be the worst people in the entire world to do something so cruel. I feel like we‚Äôre missing details. Like do your parents commonly favor your sister over you and other such details?
Anxiety,falny1h,t3_e9mrog,1576187543.0,This is so heartwarming! I bet they look forward to hearing more jokes from you.
adhd_anxiety,f8p701i,t3_e1a1er,1574696708.0,"Yeah you‚Äôre not alone. I‚Äôm the same way and I beat myself up a lot because of it. Lately I‚Äôve been doing grounding techniques! I count objects in the room, sometimes I feel objects, or pay attention to colors. I count from 1 to 20 and 20 down to 1. And I‚Äôm becoming more in touch with my daily life. Maybe you should try things like this! :)"
Anxiety,f8mzmjn,t3_e11xwm,1574637239.0,Yeah big time. I used to do it a lot many years ago. But I just stopped because I felt weird lol. I got out more and eventually forgot I used to do that. It never really interfered with my life much. To what extent is it interfering with your life may I ask? Don‚Äôt feel so bad about it.
JusticeServed,f89qdva,t3_dxd50f,1574377739.0,This is disgusting they‚Äôre beating her up for no reason. She‚Äôs clearly not much of a threat she‚Äôs just drunk.
Anxiety,f80stzc,t3_dy6hb6,1574137349.0,Good luck! I‚Äôm excited for you guys!
Anxiety,f7ual5s,t3_dxn75q,1574013096.0,I do that all the time and then snap out of it and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwoah man I forgot to breathe for a second‚Äù üò≠
