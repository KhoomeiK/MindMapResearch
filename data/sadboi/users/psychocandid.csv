hsp,fqzsld0,t3_glpuck,1589774397.0,"This is really embarrassing but I talk way too much around the person I have a crush on/am in love with because Im so dang nervous my social skills evaporate in his presence. It’s like I’m in a trance and all of this adrenaline is coursing through my body and I love him so much I just go crazy 

Also because of my anxiety I am afraid of silence so anytime there is a pause I try to fill it. Then I’m always defending myself and mind reading so I hedge everything and try to say what horrible things he must be thinking about me before he gets to open his mouth

It’s like I really want to talk to him but the minute I get the chance my anxiety and tension bubbles up so much I need a release for the racing thought. I can’t look him in the eye either because I know I am boring him and being annoying and seem narcissistic and I’m afraid to see his expression. I’ve been diagnosed with adhd and bipolar but I’m also an hsp. Around most people I’m quiet and feel the way you do. This is so embarrassing though sometimes I think of all the times I probably
annoyed this poor man and I get close to considering suicide. I love him so much but I act crazy around him inevitably driving him away. I do it on reddit too unfortunately, like now, to relieve the tension from all the racing thoughts"

ADHD,fqz4ilq,t3_glgrkn,1589759773.0,Does anyone get this with people too? It sounds horrible but when I’m not around my friends (as in during a pandemic) I almost forget they exist. Maybe that’s why I rarely “miss” people even ones I’m very attached to when we are together and in frequent contact.
ADHD,fqz2xot,t1_fqyp4j5,1589758966.0,My mom is the same!
obgyn,fqynnoy,t1_fqym89e,1589751540.0,"I know it sounds like I’m a lot younger. My mom is pretty control and it’s just the two of us while I’m home from college. She knows I have been sexually active in the past but pretty much doesn’t let me out of the house much anymore. She doesn’t let me drink. She thinks I’m going to be an alcoholic like my dad and it’s bad for my mental heath. She found me at the bar connected to the restaurant where I worked a while back and dragged me out. I told her I liked this guy I met there but she won’t let me date him because we met at a bar she thinks he’s not a good guy. She doesn’t approve of anyone at the place where I work and is making me quit my job at the restaurant to work at a daycare. She doesnt want me on birth control because she says it will cause me to gain weight and other side effects. She is not very open to compromising on this and it’s hard to disagree with her. 

She doesn’t trust me pretty at all anymore and I’m not allowed anywhere without her, but she has some reason not to trust me. In college I ended up in a psych ward for severe depression and I didn’t tell her until months later. Also, I’ve sneaked out of the house in the past and lied to her and got caught. I still sneak out, though. In fact, the only time I hook up with this guy is when she leaves town to visit her boyfriend.

I now live in a rural area with a really small population and not many resources. People aren’t very “open-minded.” I grew up in the city with liberal friends and parents. I don’t really have any friends here, my mom moved here when I was in college. She needs my help pretty much every day which is part of why I have to stay inside as well. I don’t have a lot of privacy either because of our living situation. It’s just one big room (actually it’s a commercial store front). She sleeps on the bed I sleep on the couch. We don’t even have a full bathroom (we shower at the neighbors). 

I eventually plan to move out and be more independent but when I tried doing that before things got bad for both me and her and the truth is she keeps me out of trouble. She is not someone you can just say no to if you expect to maintain any sort of relationship. She has absolute control and final say and you just have to go along with it, or else you will be continuously yelled at and threatened until you end up capitulating. In return I get a less turbulent relationship with my mother.

My mom knows about my depression and anxiety and psychosis. I received a lot of help for all of this from different therapists and psychiatrists. Some things have helped a little bit some things a lot. I’m on ADHD meds and antidepressants and it’s helping me stay somewhat sane. I can talk to her about it somewhat but she gets very defensive when I express my feelings and sometimes downright angry. I think she thinks I’m attacking her parenting or it’s her fault if I talk about my low self esteem and anxiety/depression."

There’s a reason for limits and it’s annoying and shows a lack of respect for directions and for others’ time if a student goes above them especially in something like a presentation.

I would sit on the toilet for 10 minutes trying to relieve myself but it was like I had become paralyzed down there, or my muscles didn’t work, it was horrible. I felt like I was diabetic and about to die but my blood sugar was normal. Doctors tested everything and it all came back fine (except dangerously low blood pressure).

askphilosophy,fqb9bvd,t1_fqavo97,1589232849.0,"Well there’s so much to James but about this topic specifically? Well I’d start with reading Portrait of a Lady. You’ll see even the title alludes to the idea you’re asking about. The main character is essentially a work of art (a portrait). She starts out in the novel without much autonomy. She is constantly being objectified by others, mostly men. She gains control of her destiny not by breaking free of objectification all together but by objectifying herself as a work of art, by becoming both the “subject” (artist) of her own life and “object” (she views her life as her creation/narrative story). 

She engages in a kind of strange self-aesthetization (I know that’s not a word... ). Her decisions are often puzzling to readers. She can seem self-destructive and contradictory, but a lot of her life choices arise, I believe, out of this peculiar philosophy of the self as artist and art object. In the end, no one can deny that she is the master of her own destiny. 

There is a good paper I remember reading along these lines about Nietzsche, James, art and free will. I’ll try to find it for you."
