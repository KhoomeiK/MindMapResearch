I’ve had small episodes since but I spend most of my time deeply depressed. I’ve tried a lot of different medications that work for a majority of BP people but not me. I always question my diagnosis and it makes me not want to post here or other bp subreddits because I don’t feel like I fit in.

Parenting,fmspp0l,t3_fx6und,1586359984.0,"set some time aside for alone time. She goes upstairs and plays with toys in her room or maybe a tablet if you do that. It’s the only way I get a break from my kids. Set an actual timer she can see and hear so she knows when time is going and done. 

Another suggestion is playing with her. Set aside twenty minutes of your undivided attention to play. You suggest when and that gives them the feeling that mom likes me and likes playing with me. Gives them a sense of being wanted and should help get her off your back at least for a little but most importantly it’s a time to bond. 

Lastly I would make a schedule. Get some preschool work books, puzzles, maybe buy ABC mouse. Schedule play time, individual play time, quiet/alone time, screen time, school time, meal and snack time, outside time if possible, going for a walk... and anything else you might do during the day. This will help her and you get through the day. If you give them something to do they won’t get bored and need to talk and bother you so much."
Parenting,fmsofdk,t3_fx6y2l,1586359348.0,"My oldest, now 6, was similar. She seemed behind on everything. She had little to no interest in toys, she didn’t talk (except for a small handful of words) until after she turned 3. She slept like garbage, did not stack blocks, didn’t communicate, she cried all the time, potty training was not happening. It was so frustrating. 

Preschool changed everything for her. She did a 180 change. Seeing her peers do all these things encouraged her and since then she has excelled. She talks well, reads, she’s smart as heck, potty training happened eventually though it took her nearly a year to grasp the concept in totality. She’s outgoing (before she HATED kids her age), sociable, kind, talented, and surprises me daily with her intelligence. 

When I talked to her pediatrician about all of this at 3 he said he typically doesn’t recommend therapy until they were older. Which is odd to me because I’ve known many people who had kids in therapy (occupational and speech) by age 2. Regardless, she’s a normal kid now. I have no complaints. 

Just try not to be hard on yourself as a parent because your kid doesn’t do things he should be at this age. Some kids just don’t and in retrospect may mean nothing. What actually helped the most was being in therapy myself and getting advice from my therapist on dealing with it."

breakingmom,fm4gxez,t3_fspm00,1585753918.0,"I’m with you 100%. But I only have one in kinder and a preschooler. ABC mouse is my fall back when the kindergarten gets too overwhelmed with school stuff. We break school time up into two chunks, with play/outside/video game time and food time in between. My kids are getting a lot of screen time and frankly it’s the only thing keep me sane through this. But they’re still playing outside (in our yard alone), doing schoolwork, and playing with their toys. I have mandatory upstairs toy time for about an hour which gives me some moments alone. We only do school time for an hour at a time. In there I have my kindergartener do a cosmic yoga adventure episode (highly recommend, on prime video). Any time they have their tablets they go to their room with them

But even with all of that, I’m DRAINED. I don’t get true space from the kids, no alone time to decompress, my husband still has to work so all of it’s on me and it’s exhausting.

bipolar2,fkzc86l,t3_fle6cd,1584667631.0,"Being open has helped my friendships tremendously.

She understands and deals with her own stuff so it doesn’t hurt her feelings, or mine. 

I think a good promise to make for yourself is to make plans and stick to them. You’ll feel better for doing it. I always want to bail, and sometimes I do, but when I follow through my relationship with that person only gets better. 

Being vulnerable with people is important. It helps them understand how you work and how to be your friend. If you open up to someone and are met with negativity then maybe they aren’t the kind of person you want to spend time with anyway."
