StarWars,fbgs4t8,t3_ec9s40,1576857325.0,Not to be a hater on anything but the mandalorian had way too many filler episodes. The story only moved forward in ep. 7. It's still a great tv show but the pacing is bad

Stadia,f8xvdpk,t3_e2qqfk,1574935990.0,Use Chrome Beta to run stadia. Runs very well in that. Since it has no bloated features or extensions
Stadia,f8xulo3,t1_f8wn2xx,1574935270.0,Don't use mouse and keyboard. But if you want to. Download Chrome Beta. It runs well with no lag on that. Don't use normal chrome. Apparently all the extensions etc affect it

FallenOrder,f8v4t5g,t3_e2706p,1574859482.0,I want there to be a mod where we can play as Merrin. In my opinion her character was much more cooler and her powers seemed to be more fun than being a jedi
