I do not recommend, but it‚Äôll be quite wild if you do. I‚Äôve had lengthy conversations with shadow figures that I believed were my cats‚Äô spirits in human form, trying to communicate with me on the normal plain of existence.

ptsd,fi63rir,t3_f6ia4u,1582178027.0,"Vital detail: I have PTSD from long-term sexual abuse as a child.

For some reason, I signed up for a program where I work directly with children who suffer from social & emotional issues. This made me extremely uncomfortable in the beginning ‚Äî to the point of panic attacks & flashbacks ‚Äî and I skipped a lot because of this. But I stuck to it. I continued to go, regardless of my PTSD symptoms. I saw myself in these kids, and I wanted to provide the compassion and support I wish I had received. It was hard; it is hard.

Yet here I am, 6 months into it & continuing forward. I still have hard days, but they aren‚Äôt as hard as they were. I still stay home sometimes, but I try to be patient and compassionate with myself as well.

Mind you, I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist for 8 years. I‚Äôve learned a lot & am able to better address my trauma & the symptoms of PTSD when they arise.

HARD WORK, PATIENCE & COMPASSION PAY OFF. 

But man, let me tell you, actually working through the trauma fucking sucked. It‚Äôs hard, it hurts, it digs up a lot of memories we prefer to leave hidden... but it‚Äôs worth it in the end. I function, like actually function now. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still struggle, but not like I used to. I am not trying to kms every 6 months.
