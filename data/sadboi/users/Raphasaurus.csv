My parents (up until I went apeshit and snapped at them) would constantly force me to cover up in public (mum asked me to put pants on when it was 47 fucking degrees celcius outside). I haven't been to the beach with my parents since before I self harmed. My boyfriend and his family are supportive and while his little sister asks about them she doesn't keep nagging me when I'm very vague and their parents (well bfs parents and half siblings mum) are supportive of me. This year is the first year I'm comfortable being out in public with my scars. It's taken a few years and I still get comments sometimes, especially at work I've had patients ask what I did to myself. It's already hard because I look so young (they think I'm too young to be a nurse and I'm too weak and tiny)


Recovering from them is hard. They might not fade. I know it's so hard to resist those voices. So hard to resist the sensation of it even when you're not doing it. But you've got this. Your nana seems to have your back and you can be far away from your shitty mum and oldest sister.

I had a boxer before my cavalier and she was lovely with Gizmo. We'd have Gizmo fly around the house (supervised) with the dog out. My cavalier on the other hand while she's the sweetest dog I've ever met, she has a mean hunting streak and it's extremely rare for Gizmo to be out of his cage in the same room as her. 10 years together and she still can't be trusted near him, especially as Gizmo isn't a strong flier in his old age."
mildlyinteresting,f94gcvf,t1_f94g8bc,1575087394.0,Glad to know you've done some research though. So yeah. Join groups and get info from people who actually have tiels and then wait until you have your own place (or are renting but have it in writing that the landlords have given permission for you to own a birb). I also suggest getting two (preferably same sex to avoid breeding at this stage) so they have company the times you're not home.
mildlyinteresting,f94g8bc,t1_f94ecdi,1575087278.0,"I suggest going in Facebook and joining some cockatiel groups. Sometimes they're really judgemental but often they offer great advice. I still suggest you wait until you move out though because say you get a tiel, it bonds with your mum instead and you move out. It would be unfair to separate the tiel from your mum but she may not want to care for it as well. I really want to get a second tiel but I'm moving to the other end of the country in 6ish months and if the tiel bonds with my parents, they don't want another pet to look after, they wanna travel then whey retire in 10-15 years which they can't do with animals."

mildlyinteresting,f94dewe,t1_f94ctb5,1575084763.0,"Well she's not wrong. Any bird is a huuuuge responsibility. They're not all friendly like the ones you see on the internet (Gizmo rarely is) and cockatiels especially are VERY temperamental and clingy. They're very loud, they bite hard enough to draw blood, they get very aggressive when hormonal. There's a lot to consider too. Females have issues with egg binding and often birbs will just bond with one person and be aggressive towards all others. Gizmo was supposed to be my older brother's birb but he grew attached to my mum instead and was aggressive towards everyone else (he's a few weeks shy of 19 and we've had him since he was a baby). If people aren't gonna be hone much, don't bother. I mentioned above they're VERY clingy. It's like a cavalier king charles in birb form.

If you do want a birb, do heaps of research and remember, it's like owning a toddler for 10-80 years (depends on what sort of birb). Also if you're an older teen, wait until you've moved out and settled down even if it takes a few years after high school. If your tiel bonds with you and you move out, moving will be stressful and you may not find a place straight away that will accept birbs. Vice versa too. If your birb hates you and you move, don't separate it from the person in the family it loves, and think about your parents; will they want to look after a tiel if it doesn't like you and you move out? That's why I haven't adopted a second one, I'm waiting until I move next year."

Just hearing about it and seeing and hearing disgusting reactions and comments from onlookers messed me up. Seeing how it messed up the train lines for the day.

AskReddit,eq99fjs,t3_bxrcyx,1559894633.0,"Depends on how bad I am and whether or not I'm under-medicated. Long before I got help, it was my dog and my bird. Then it was just blind optimism which just kept hurting and disappointing me. Then it was my boyfriend (of now 2.5 years). Then it was literally living day to day trying to find something to look forward to. 

Now it's knowing that while depression feels like it lasts forever, it will always pass eventually. While life seems dull sometimes, there's still always something that I'll enjoy even if it's just a fleeting moment, like my dog or birb doing something cute or ragdoll physics in Overwatch being stupid (or absolutely destroying the other team or getting some epic game saving reses).

Some days, weeks and months are hard but I've established a support network and set myself up for the future as well. My friends and boyfriend don't expect me to be happy but understand that sometimes I just need to be alone or want company but don't want to interact. I've learnt ways to cope effectively through DBT and practice and when these skills stop working, it's usually a medication issue as nowadays it's very rare for me to be stuck in a rut for more than a few weeks (right now it's been a few months so I've changed medication again, hopefully it gets me out)"
explainlikeimfive,eq9904h,t3_bxro3m,1559893950.0,"The cell membrane is made of 2 fatty layers, each with one end that is attracted to fluid (fluid inside and fluid outside the cell) and another end which meets between the ""fluid loving"" ends which repel fluid. This cell membrane is semipermeable, meaning that it can selectively let substances in. The substances that can enter freely in and out of the cell are water ions and other small molecules via diffusion and osmosis.

Diffusion is where a substance passes from an area of high concentration to low concentration and requires no energy whatsoever. Say there's not a lot of oxygen inside a cell but there's a lot outside the cell. The oxygen outside the cell will be drawn inside the cell without using up any energy at all. It's as if your car is going downhill on a slope. You can just leave it in neutral and it will roll down without using any energy. 

In this context you can think of osmosis as the same thing as diffusion, however with water. 

Diffusion and osmosis are forms of passive transport, meaning that they don't use energy (car in neutral rolling down a hill)

Large molecules such as glucose, aren't able to enter and exit the cell freely. This is where that semipermeable membrane stuff comes to play. There are channels located around the membrane which selectively allow molecules through. There are different channels for different substances (correct me if I'm wrong) which open up when said substance is needed. The channels are large proteins which open and close. The way that they know to only let certain molecules in is that they have certain shapes for certain molecules. Like that children's toy with the different shaped blocks and holes and each hole accommodates one shape/block. 

This is an example of active transport as it requires some form of energy or a chemical to actually transport the substance, in this case a protein with receptors. It can be like in order to play a Gameboy, it requires energy or something not included, such as batteries. These are the receptors on the proteins that signal when a substance is needed so the channel can open. 

Please correct me if I'm wrong or of my examples aren't great, it's been a while. Hope this helps :)"

DBT has been a literal life saver (doing it since Feb 2018). Even in the depressive episode and sfter witnessing a suicide of the same method I contemplated, I've been able to avoid problematic behaviours like self harm, lashing out and sleeping constantly. I have trouble going out but I'm trying to most days even if it's a short drive to the shops a minute away."
AskReddit,eq76rm7,t3_a9g1ya,1559841492.0,"Very late to the party but a few years ago I had a daily routine of walking my dog in the evening just before the sun started setting. Well this one day my knee gave out (floating kneecap) and I had a panic attack and couldn't bring myself to leave the house. A few minutes later, my parents left to go dancing (they do ballroom). I just sat and watched TV with an ice pack on my knee and the dog on the couch next to me.

I heard mum's car pull up into the driveway. That was weird. They were only gone for around 15-20 minutes. I go outside and am met with a heavily dented roof and a shattered windscreen. Turns out a tree had fallen on the car, right when I would've reached that spot on my dog walk. If my knee hadn't given out or I didn't have such a huge panic attack preventing me from leaving the house, I would've lost my life along with my beautiful little cavi. Only reason my parents survived was because mum had a well built car. 

The place the tree fell was only about 2 mins away on foot. Reason my parents took so long was they had to wait for cops to show up and take statements and make sure they were alright. They then took dad's car and made it to dancing on time. 

Moral of the story, trust your gut when something doesn't feel right. And VW polos can survive trees falling on them."

entitledparents,eq2mbc2,t3_bws47a,1559740013.0,"This is why I'm paranoid when my little fur baby is at the shops with me while I wait for friends or parents and young kids come to her. Sometimes they can be rough with her (she's just a little cavi). Whenever this has happened though, parents have grabbed their kids away and apologise before I could even say anything (anxiety, I stutter and can't get words out when nervous, leaving the house makes me shit bricks, let alone walking the dog and getting attention especially when I had a stalker in the area last year)"

entitledparents,epydup3,t3_bwfb8t,1559629522.0,"Lol when I was in year 12 and had free periods we'd often go get chicken and chips coz there was a shopping centre right next to our school. Walked past a teacher I had for roll call from years 7-11. She came to me and tried to give me detention for leaving early (I went home and got changed as my frees were at the end of the day, I live very close to shops). Forgetting I was both in year 12. Thankfully I had my free period pass and receipt showing I signed out of school in my wallet, otherwise I'd be in a hell of a lot of trouble"

LivestreamFail,epebj0h,t1_eochq2t,1559180761.0,"A proper open relationship doesn't work like that. I know people who are in one and my partner and I have discussed it (but don't think we'll go through with it). It takes trust and usually a lot of discussion. Neither parties go around banging whoever they please. They still need permission for it as well and just general ground rules 

If it's used as an excuse to sleep around like how you mentioned, it's not an open relationship.

I also don't disagree at all with your statement with a power imbalance. It's definitely easier for a woman to find a sexual partner. I got asked a lot in high school (never accepted because anxiety and body issues from bullying) but most of the guys who asked me either had trouble finding a partner or theirs had just decided to stop the arrangement."
EUGENIACOONEY,eofjzca,t1_eo3a85y,1558536412.0,Just in general confidentiality is one of the number 1 things they teach any medical professional so I second that you can't just ring up and ask if someone is a patient there (nurse student experience)
