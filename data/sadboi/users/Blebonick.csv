The existence of death gives life meaning. We live our life so much more fully knowing that at some point it will all be over and the only thing that will exist is the marks we leave behind, in people and things.

We are the water that makes up a wave. Eventually, the wave returns to the ocean, but for a moment, the wave was there, and it was was big, and beautiful. And when the wave has gone, the water is still there. Maybe it's filtered into drinking water and gives someone else life. Maybe it evaporates and a kid laughs as its droplets fall into their eyes or mouth

We can never predict the impact our life has had on someone, but we never go out of the world - something we said. or did, keeps being passed on to more and more people.

Our time on earth matters because it ends, eventually. And people will grieve. and mourn, and move on, with little fragments of ourselves in their hearts, guiding them in imperceptible ways."

Anxiety,fdatsct,t3_ekdvy0,1578250051.0,"Hey OP,

I don't know if this will help to know, but anxiety/depression is often associated with memory loss. Many people diagnosed with these things (including me) will feel like memories of the ones closest to them are slipping through their grasp.

Two things have helped me come to terms with that. The first is to notice when, for a moment, you're thinking about memories of the past. If you really invest yourself in those memories, you'll start to notice more memories of things you haven't thought of in years. Focusing on specific memories can make others come out of that haze naturally.

The second is to recognise that you are not defined by who you were in the past. You are still changing and growing, and maybe it's ok to let your old selves go a little bit. If you recognise that, you can make day-to-day memories with your loved ones mean more to you. It's something that worked for me.

Good luck!"

PrincessesOfPower,fda9ypr,t1_fda59cf,1578243468.0,"I completely agree, and your analysis of the Catra/SW/Adora relationship is really insightful and well done.  Catra's resentment of Adora is because Adora has gotten everything she ever wanted: Shadow Weaver's and Hordak's respect, Horde Captain position, a supportive group of friends and SW's devotion. Catra's attachment and obsession with Adora, and the way she will sacrifice everything to get Adora back, is also strongly based in Shadow Weaver's own obsession with Adora.

Every time Shadow Weaver chooses Adora over Catra, you can see it strongly affect and hurt Catra. When they were kids, she punished Adora but praised Catra. When they were adults, she escaped Horde cells and ran directly to Brightmoon's custody. Even if Catra finds happiness (like in Once Upon a Time in the Waste) it is quickly ruined by realising she could be happier if she were Adora.

 I believe that Shadow Weaver's preferential treatment for Adora has fed strongly into Catra's friendship/feelings for Adora, and that's a strong reason why they should not end up together. These feelings are not Catra's own. They are partly Shadow Weaver's. And their relationship is violent, toxic and manipulative - as a direct parallel to Shadow Weaver's relationship with them both.

This is why I don't think Catradora should ever be canon."

You really can't separate those songs from those memories, but I believe reliving those memories for a few days is a good thing. It lets you remember who you were back then, and how you've grown since then. You remember how special that friendship was, even though it ended. And then you go on with your life with a bit of a better idea of who you are and where you came from."
