And I thought I wasn't all that knowledgeable about computers. Doesn't everyone know you have to make significant compromises for a handheld?

Maybe it's marketing issue, I think if they advertised one of these as a retroish and indie gaming machine they would sell better. Oh and somehow it doesn't come naturally to some that if you've been playing games on PC for years then you likely already have a meaty library of titles to play on one of these.
