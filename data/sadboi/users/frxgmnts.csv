BPD,fdfw8qp,t3_el480t,1578371897.0,"One thing I've realised is that, at least personally, that i have a very accute idea of a relationship, especially with my FPs, about how they're supposed to be - not going back on their words, not breaching my trust, that they can't ever hurt me, etc. 
But no relationship with anyone, even the best ones that we have, will ever meet my ideal necessities from a relationship. 
I really do understand your anguish because a year back, i would take such a situation so fucking personally, Like bitch how dare you fucking cancel on me? Which would eventually lead up to me questioning my self worth through the eyes of this person who cancelled the plans.
Later in some situations i would find out that they themselves were going through some shit or were genuinely involved with something else. Which would then put me in another loop of questioning my self worth now seasoned with guilt. 

I've just stopped forcing my relationships to be the certain way that i want them to function, give your people some space and yourself as well within this dynamic that you share with them.

Hope you feel better! 
Hugs"

BPD,f931swt,t3_e3eytd,1575047701.0,"You have no idea how much peace this has given me. I have been feeling alone, suicidal and at the end of my rope for the past month or so. Two of my closest friends became so distant that i just couldn't bear with it anymore. 
But this gives me a reason to have a bit more of self faith and patience with all these symptoms rising up constantly and making me want to jump off a building. 
Thanks a lot, this might have just saved me. 
Big hugs man, big hugs."
