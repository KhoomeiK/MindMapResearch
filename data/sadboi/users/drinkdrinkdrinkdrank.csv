Blogilates,fqqo5gi,t3_gke5zz,1589568948.0,"Playing devil's advocate - you're only going to pant and gasp the less you do it. If you follow it for a week, by the end you will still be panting and gasping, but it'll be significantly less, and more controlled, and it won't be as overwhelming. The only way to get better at cardio without the genetic makeup for it is to just suffer through it until your body can handle it better. If you do a cardio video, its okay to pause it to cool down for a minute and grab a drink of water. There are NO RULES!!! Plus you already know the benefits of cardio - strength training doesn't do for your body what cardio will do.

BUT on a more helpful note, the calendar is just a guide and shouldn't be taken as an all-or-nothing program. You can do one video instead of four (because lets be honest, sometimes four or five a session is A LOT). You can even skip the calendar and do what you and your body need. I can't do too much glute work because I have IT band issues, so this week ended up being a rest week for me and I'm grateful for it, as much as I wanted to follow the program.  You do you, boo"
Blogilates,fqdyriy,t3_gidtid,1589298910.0,"I like the calendar because it removes the part where I have to decide, which makes it easier to get me to do it. If I have to figure out what I want to do and sort through videos, I end up doing the same three or four videos all the time and get bored/lazy. Her calendar incorporates her new video, but also a lot of her old ones, so you get a good variety. 

However, I don't do every video every day. Some days I'm busy or also going for a run, so I will do a couple videos instead of the 3-5 she lists, or give myself a rest day. My advice is to use it as a guideline, not as an all-or-nothing."

EatingDisorders,fo2u6xg,t3_g59ymb,1587474186.0,"I spoke with my therapist recently about these feelings. We identified it as Imposter Syndrome. I felt as though maybe I was being overdramatic, or maybe my doctors just didn't get that I wanted to be skinnier. 

The reality is that I knew what I was doing. Even once I knew it in my head it didn't stop me. That doesn't invalidate the disorder, because for many of us, that *is* the disorder. 

EDs are not cookie cutter. We are all in this together but the way we got here doesn't always align, and the ways that we feel better and get healthier are not going to match, either. Your ED is your own. You can take advice and listen to the experiences of the others, but you shouldn't write it off as ""well theirs was worse so mine can't be real"" or ""they went inpatient when I didn't, so I should be quiet"".
