Ive since become vegetarian and transitioned to highly restrictive vegetarian (no eggs or dairy) but I'll ever make it to full vegan because you can never be 'pure' enough to not have someone tell you that something you still do disqualifies you. It's why I hope one day to find a term that separates vegetarian from a vegetarian that also doesn't consume eggs or dairy. In fact, I found myself occasionally being willing to eat something with a small amount of an ingredient that I otherwise avoid because I know that I'd already be considered not doing enough so it's less of a big deal if little bits slip in now and then because I'm already considered a failure so who would I be trying to impress?"

What makes things especially chaotic is that the younger dog I let her pick out to be a companion is terrified of human children so girl scout season (in prior, non pandemic years) was one dog desperately trying to drag us towards the scouts (which, prior to dog #2, I gleefully cooperated with because cookies=yum!) and the other desperately trying to get us to flee."

But I don't get much joy from eating, if any, because even if I like some of the things I make, I have them so consistently that they get kind of boring.
