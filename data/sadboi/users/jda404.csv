Of course all consensual but at the same I'd want it to be a surprise so I wouldn't know what day it was happening on, but it'd be discussed thoroughly before it ever happened.

snowrunner,fq4f9jz,t1_fq3nny5,1589077018.0,"Same still working on the Smithville Dam map, haven't visited the other two parts of Michigan yet, and then I have Alaska and Tamyr definitely a game I'll be playing and coming back to for a long while."
snowrunner,fq4eq54,t1_fq3ty2g,1589076840.0,That was me today I drove terrible just kept flipping and rolling trucks. I flipped the recovery truck a bunch too having to recover back to the garage. I think I might need a break from the game haha been playing it non stop since it came out but it's so addicting.
snowrunner,fq4adf4,t1_fq2vndd,1589075293.0,"Ever watch Ron Pratt on YouTube? He does a lot of recoveries using a rotator really cool to watch, videos can be pretty long though. Here's one with a log truck nearly an hour and a half video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN6pmxzA8FA&t="
PS5,fq3ugvk,t1_fq1cwlm,1589070417.0,Gosh I miss Motorstorm those were some good racing games.
snowrunner,fq3tgua,t1_fq385wj,1589070056.0,Same. I mean it's so close to the garage that if I absolutely need to recover it won't take but a few seconds to get back to the hill and try again.
AskRedditAfterDark,fq1u21l,t3_gggyj0,1589049335.0,I don't get it either. I know a lot of popular Reddit girls have onlyfans now and so I figure people are mad that these girls are posting more to a place you have to pay than they're posting to Reddit now so Redditors are getting less free content from their favorite posters.
snowrunner,fq1feol,t1_fq15se8,1589045169.0,"If this happens to me I am done for a few weeks until some patches start happening. Won't try to refund as I love the game, but I'll be so frustrated if I have to start over kind of why I am going slow, still only on Smithville Dam nearly done with the contracts there."
AMA,fq0sx0r,t1_fpzrtf7,1589037212.0,What does that have to do with turning her boyfriend in for CP?
pics,fq0q8ja,t1_fq0oofo,1589035937.0,My neighbor mows like every 4 days ha and to be fair his yard does look nice lawn guys love their lawns. I just wait until it's high usually every 7-10 days sometimes longer definitely not a lawn guy here.
snowrunner,fq0jmqm,t3_ggf5od,1589032905.0,Damn my small brain never thought to sell the trailer right back! I knew buying fuel trailers come with a free tank of fuel ha but yeah never thought to instantly resell the fuel trailer.
PS5,fq059gi,t1_fpy0lmv,1589027769.0,Eh as long as the apps are optional I say sure why not. If people want to watch tiktok and look at Reddit on their PS5 I do not care it does not affect me as long as I am not forced to download it haha.
snowrunner,fq03zjc,t3_ggcgf6,1589027388.0,"Last night I rolled my flatbed truck with crane carrying a concrete slab, hopped in another truck to turn over the rolled truck and use crane to pick the load up and proceeded to roll the recovery truck in the exact same spot. Turned the game off and went to bed, about to hop on and try again."
NFLNoobs,fq02ygp,t1_fpy2dvq,1589027079.0,"From a fan's point of view I agree. I think QBs need to be good consistently for 5-6 seasons before I'd call them a veteran, but a RB or WR can get to veteran status in 2-3 seasons of really good play. Everyone will have a different opinion though after all my book is just an opinion book ha no facts to back up what I am saying."
LosAngelesRams,fpy6fza,t1_fpxatpb,1588997033.0,"Why? If my employer isn't paying me what I am owed I am bitching too. I get it, he's made millions and will be fine that's not the point  everyone deserves what they are owed no matter if it's 10 bucks or 10 million bucks."
LosAngelesRams,fpy5s6r,t3_gg2ip5,1588996619.0,"Nice definitely better than the new logos! I wish I knew how to edit, I'd make one with the logo from last year and the previous however many years we used it for ha, but given the dislike for the new logo, I am sure one will pop up."
snowrunner,fpxh3ro,t1_fpwzste,1588982532.0,Yeah find them a bit odd in a slow paced game that we have a few missions that require you to be fast if you want the most amount of cash/XP. I guess they were trying to have something a little different to do.
