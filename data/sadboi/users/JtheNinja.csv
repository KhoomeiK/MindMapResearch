(there's more to it than that, such as several different low polys of increasingly higher detail depending on how close you are to the model, but that's the gist of it)

UE5 instead converts the high poly itself into a texture, then reconstructs that texture into a mesh on the fly.

>A lot of time has passed since this post. My current thinking down these lines is that GPUs aren't powerful enough yet to tessellate everything down to micropolygon sizes. When they become fast enough semi uniform tessellation is a perfect solution. At the moment we are forced to render triangles covering at least 8x8 pixels on average. There are important places and unimportant places to spend those triangles and the best algorithms to do that are in the progressive mesh category. There are a ton of hard problems there to solve: data compression, view adaptive simplification, smooth transitions, etc.  

>If you are interested in the latest in geometry images I'd suggest looking into vector displacement mapping and ptex. It is very similar except texels store relative positions instead of absolute.

I guess GPUs are fast enough now. ""like vector displacement+ptex, but absolute positions instead of relative"" makes a little more sense to me.

HDR requires somewhat more bits since it essentially makes the gradient longer.

Monitors,fq1ai7v,t1_fq18cd0,1589043817.0,"Well, no. HDR only uses the extra brightness when it needs to. If you're setting to 10-30% brightness on an SDR monitor, you're doing it correctly! Most need to be set that low so that the white point (""1.0"", or 255 since it's an 8bit integer signal) comes out as 120nits like it's supposed to. HDR can go brighter than that, but only if the person who created that HDR content set it to do so.

The problem is, without local dimming or OLED, you only have ~1000:1 contrast ratio. So if the signal feed says there's a 300nit element on screen, the darkest anything else on screen can be is 0.3nits. This can make shadows look washed out if there are very bright and very dark elements on screen at the same time.

EVERYONE can benefit from HDR if it's done properly. It's a pretty amazing change to how video formats work that fixes and improves a lot of longstanding problems in digital video. It also adds a ton of future proofing (when we get fancy micro LED displays that can hit single-wavelength colors and adjust per-pixel from no light output to 2000nits, there is already HDR content that can make use of that).

And in some ways, most modern screens can already do better than SDR. SDR was meant for CRTs. Nobody making the spec really planned for screens that could throw 300-500nits or more, 100-120 was about all they could hope for. So HDR can help make use of that capability, the problem is just that most HDR content is meant for displays that have WAYY more capability than SDR screens, not just a little bit more."

SDR kinda does this technically in that “255” is supposed to correspond to 120nits, but HDR displays are a lot stricter at actually following this.

However, that metadata is going to specify a hell of a lot of stuff being over 300 nits, so how good of an experience you’ll get is pretty questionable. HDR also has a wider color gamut and 10bit, but this display probably can’t make use of that either. My experience is that DisplayHDR400 requirements are basically the bare minimum to get an experience that’s an improvement over SDR, and lots of people don’t even agree with that. Remember the HDR content is geared towards displays with a lot more contrast and max brightness than 1000:1 and 300nits. HDR includes some info to help your display adapt, but there’s only so much you can do. You might just be better off with the SDR version that’s been designed for a more limited display like this."

Well, we don't know why people become superspreaders. If it's because they have contact with a lot of people due to their job or just being highly social, that same attribute also makes them more likely to get infected in the first place.

>Wouldn't some of the 40 be a super-spreader as well?

Not necessarily. Like if a grocery checkout person gets it, they could spread it to 40 customers who have work-from-home jobs. Those people will go on to spread it to...maybe a family member or roommate, if they even have one."

If you need accurate colors, you really should get a colorimeter. Without one it's impossible to say whether the 6500K setting or the sRGB setting on your monitor is actually closer to D65.

What these sorts of threads are hoping for is someone who has calibrated this model with a colorimeter and can share what settings they came up with. This is pretty unreliable as it is \*waves at flair\* but think about who buys colorimeters: designers and other creative professionals. Now look at what kind of display the VG278Q is. It's a 27"" 1080p144 TN display. It sacrifices basically everything on the altar of being fast. It's low res, and the color consistency of TNs is poor due to the gamma shift. So it's the last thing any designer would want to buy, for content creation you'd much rather have a 1440p60 IPS than a 1080p144 TN. The only real hope is a rich and picky gamer who bought a colorimeter to set their OSD for gaming...except why would someone willing to pay $100+ for color quality only spend $300 on the display itself?

tl:dr the market overlap between people who buy this type of monitor and people who buy colorimeters is pretty sparse."

Even if it is, that doesn't mean they'll match. Manufacturing differences are enough to be visible, even if every single part in the monitor is the same. This REALLY should be done with a colorimeter, but if you don't have one, display a white image fullscreen on both displays and adjust the ""custom color"" R/G/B sliders until they visually match.

I should note even with a colorimeter this can be tricky because Windows doesn't support per-display software 3D LUTs and most software on Windows doesn't use software LUTs anyway. OSD adjustments and the video card gamma table might not be enough to get 2 displays to match completely perfectly. Especially if both monitors are separately calibrated to the same target(such as sRGB), rather than calibrating the second monitor using the first monitor as a target."
Monitors,fphcer5,t3_gdh3nr,1588618781.0,"Most of the banding in that first video is very clearly compression artifacts (notice how the edges of the bands are noisy, if you look at the video on different displays that bands are in the same places).

A much better way to test is to use a CSS gradient like this, as they're procedurally generated in your browser: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/JdEjWm (assuming your browser doesn't dither CSS gradients, apparently some do?)
