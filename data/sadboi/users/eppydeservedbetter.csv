rupaulsdragrace,fqrky67,t1_fqrgb9r,1589586454.0,"I do too, mostly because a popular and instantly recognisable queen would be a good draw. They’d reel in viewers and give some security for the business and marketing side of the show. If Drag Race did lose Ru, the likes of WoW, VH1 and Netflix will worry about whether an alternate version of RPDR (or a rebranded Drag Race) will be as marketable and profitable without Ru as the face of the competition. Someone like Trixie, Alyssa, Alaska, Bob (etc) could help promote the show and encourage people to continue watching it.

Without a super popular queen as the host, casual viewers like my mother may lose interest because they’ll want Ru. My mother definitely wouldn’t watch a Ru-less version of Drag Race until I encouraged her to give it a chance. She’ll think it wasn’t the same without Ru. Once people warmed up to a new version of the show, it would be fine. It’s the initial pilot season that would really need to take off or else Drag Race could come off the air completely. That would be a real shame after it’s achieved such international success."

rupaulsdragrace,fqqwwlc,t3_gkfsbh,1589573434.0,"The show needed Ru. Without Ru, the show wouldn’t have taken off.

I’d say that in a way, it still does. I think we sometimes forget how beloved and popular Ru is outside of this sub, and outside of the super invested Drag Race fan base. It is *RuPaul’s* Drag Race. Ru is the head judge. Ru is the most famous drag queen in the world. Ru has appeared in so many interviews and magazines, and celebrity events, etc. They are heavily associated with the show because...it is  Ru’s show. I’d worry that a lot of viewers would lost interest in Ru left, and Drag Race could even be dropped from the likes of VH1 and popular streaming services. A lot of viewers are just as excited to see what RuPaul will look like each episode, and they only know the motherly, wise Ru that is presented to us on the show, so that makes her seem warm, all-knowing and likeable. While a lot of us fans are critical of Ru and don’t need her to enjoy Drag Race, other viewers will be furious. My mam and I have had viewing parties with friends and family, and my friend and I once discussed Ru leaving. In particular, it was our mothers who were shocked by this idea. They said it would be a terrible decision. If Ru leaves, they think the show will be a waste of time because it won’t be RuPaul’s Drag Race anymore, and they want Ru! They forget which contestant is which, but Ru is constant and they adore RuPaul.

That being said, the show is now bigger than Ru. I think the it will need to become America’s Drag Race or something - a total rebrand. That might put some people off, but Drag Race is so popular now that I think it will be a success. We can still have Drag Con and tours, etc. There could be more inclusivity, and drag kings could finally be included too.

If Ru does step down, I think it will be the definite end of RuPaul’s Drag Race, but America’s Drag Race could thrive. I certainly don’t think it would make a difference for us dedicated drag and/or Drag Race fans because we will happily watch any Drag Race show, so long as it was entertaining."

We were all crushed when Shea 4-challenge-wins-Coulee lost the crown to the LSFTC format, but Sasha deserved her win that night. She didn’t make the rule change, and she more than rose the challenge. I still get chills watching Sasha and Shea’s ‘So Emotional’ lip sync.

Sasha is very smart and knowledgeable. She part-jokingly labels herself as a queer historian, and she’s not wrong. She’s done her research! She is an incredible performer, and her looks are on another level since her season. Her drag collective show, ‘Nightgowns’ and her one-woman show, ‘Smoke & Mirrors’ are both magical.
