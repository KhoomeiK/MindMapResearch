GilmoreGirls,ewn1bwy,t1_ewml9s5,1565565906.0,"I really enjoy GG because it allows us to love very flawed but wonderful characters. Even in very exaggerated situations, they feel... human. We can relate to the good and the bad traits, and see that sometimes smart people make stupid decisions."
BPD,ev6n2te,t3_cihldk,1564248903.0,That's amazing!
BPD,eurcqds,t3_ch8umt,1563992437.0,"I feel like I didn't mature enough to understand what is going on around me. Like when you were a kid listening to adults talking about ""adult stuff"" and couldn't make sense of anything, but it sure looked like they had everything under control and knew so many things... and one day you would be like them.
When people are mad at me for something I did related to BPD, they often accuse me of being too childish or immature. It hurts because I try to grow as a person, but some mental mechanisms (?) never really developed to acceptable levels."

BPD,euiijse,t1_euihqhy,1563848525.0,"Oh, the physical symptoms are the worst! My whole body suffers.
Do you suffer from anxiety issues? I believe this isolation and quiet BPD started when my anxiety got worse. I was always shy, but before I had absolutely no problem with crying and screaming and hurting myself in public. Nowadays I'm too anxious to even leave my house, can't really interact with people and basically just want to be invisible, and I know anxiety frequently causes physical symptoms."
BPD,euial1j,t3_cgkqvm,1563843767.0,"Yup. Right now I'm trying my best to start something I can do from home, but it's hard. One boss even accompanied me to the hospital during a breakdown and still didn't believe me and made me lose my job shortly after. Other times I got so miserable and suicidal after a month or two that I just had to quit. I have no idea why I'm so affected by jobs, maybe it's the stress from having to ""behave"" so much and trying to avoid conflict with, well, everyone, all the time."
