SuicideWatch,fphqr99,t1_fphpetg,1588626081.0,"Certainly. Depression is an imbalance of the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine, which are chemicals that your brain receives for feelings of gratification/happiness. (A bit more complex than that, but I’m not a biologist.) Normally these neurotransmitters have slight fluctuations in presence levels, so people feel a little happy or a little sad from time to time. If someone has depression, the fluctuations are much more severe, so the downs are very down for much longer, which signifies a depressive episode. (Fun fact: if the same thing happens for highs, that’s classified as bipolar.) 

Antidepressants work to supplement the neurotransmitters and level out the fluctuations, much like birth control does with estrogen. That’s where the “happy pill” myth comes from: they only add a little more than what’s considered baseline, but not by much. And because antidepressants are so different in structure, it takes experimentation to find one that works, and changes down the line (I’m personally on my third antidepressant, but the changes were spaced out and took patience). 

This is also why psychologists and psychiatrists recommend eating well and exercising, because there is a link between physical wellness and proper neurotransmitter production.

On top of physical treatment, psychological therapy can help you to identify and avoid/manage triggers (yup, you get the legitimate trigger pass). 

Depression is not easy to treat at first, and it should be managed physically with meds and lifestyle, and mentally with therapy and building a support group. But in my experience, the sooner you treat it, the better off you’ll be in the long run.

And yes, you do deserve it. I used to think I was never “sick enough” to get treatment, even after two attempts on my life. But if I had to go back, I would have gotten treatment sooner, because I’ve never felt better or been more realistic than I am now. At the very least, therapy can help you see the reality of your depression."
SuicideWatch,fphoov4,t3_gdjgjy,1588625005.0,"That’s like saying you have no reason to have lung cancer. Depression is a physical illness of the brain, but a lot of media sends out the message that it’s based on circumstance and reversible by will. That may be true for someone facing an irregular episode, but if you’re having suicidal thoughts, then your depression is severe and not only needs treatment, but deserves treatment. You are always entitled to care and for family, friends, and healthcare workers to take your needs seriously."
