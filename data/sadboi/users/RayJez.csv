The statement of negative environmental impact of these solar farmers outweigh the benefits sounds counter intuitive considering the 
Sun delivers power free ready to use and clean  , does not release methane in mining or poisonous metas/ toxic chemical - coal needs roads / rail also needs to be milled and washed then pumped into burners that use oxygen to burn 
Solar emits no smoke on power generation ( both renewables and fossils need to mine metals to produce power stations) whereas fossils produce large amounts of toxic gases.
Soar / wind do not need transport systems to remove the waste , fossils need ash dumps , 12 million tonnes in Australia for coal alone ( it’s on google) where are the waste sunlight dumps or the mountains of wind that has been used , where is the poisonous used sunlight stored .
The fossil industry is skilled ,as is Big Tobacco, in ‘adjusting ‘the information to cast shade on the competition 
The whole cycle of fossil fuel is far greater than just the energy production cycle and don’t start me on nuclear
Fossils are dying - not this year or next year but in our lifetime their production will be so small as to be negligible

Just because the US govt chooses to spend more on war than it does on its own citizens health or welfare or more than the next 25 nations is a curious method of measurement.
I am old enough to have heard the old phrase “ energy too cheap to meter “ for fission - which has turned out to be a huge white elephant except for the war mongers .

Marsha Linehan started DBT over two decades ago and is now the ‘gold standard ‘ treatment for BPD (dsm iv)/ EUPD (ICD 10) .
It generally consists of two parts , the emotional skills then the therapy , the skills have to come first as the therapy will touch on the trauma so people have to be emotionally skilled - as you have experienced , just briefly talking of it has plunged you into emotional trauma.
I would suggest www.dbtselfhelp.com , read some of the articles to understand DBT then work through the skills , it all looks really complex but start anywhere and it flows - as Buddha said when asked “ how does one eat an elephant” he replied “ one bite at a time “ 
Be gentle on yourself and perhaps start with learning - and regularly practising , sometimes several times a day, the ‘mindfulness’ section 
I know everyone and his aunt suggests mindfulness these days but this is where it started in modern popular culture
