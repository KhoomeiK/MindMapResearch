BipolarReddit,fnqalt8,t3_g3ad8p,1587160896.0,"Been there. I’ve always been willing to accept my bad decisions as my own, so if you are the same - go for it.  Just be ready for VD or drama or hooking up with a crazy chick - or you can always pay for it as well.  If you know your going to regret when you come down, then be thankful for the quarantine and porn.  Satiate you’re need but ignore your ego.  As long as you are okay with the worst possible consequence, why not do the thing that only people with our disorder choose to do?"

BipolarReddit,flufuzh,t3_fr88i2,1585501771.0,"We are 1% of the population.  You can’t ask others to understand a disease process - but we can all understand how irritating some of our behaviors are.  There is no shame in being understanding of them, they are clueless to the raving thoughts and the dark nights of tortured voices and questionable reasoning.  I have decided to keep my stress low by just ignoring the comments.  You don’t have to respond; they don’t have to understand.  Just move forward and try to learn more about what exactly is going on in your head, and some coping strategies to stay as level as you can."
BipolarReddit,flu911p,t3_fqrt9i,1585497818.0,"I’ve been there, take care of yourself.  Try and find people or situations in your life that, while being comfortable, are not good for you emotionally.  I had to rid myself of 90% off my friends and moved across the United States for a new life (and new wife) to finally find happiness.  I’m still working on consistency.  Over my 45 years, my ability to control things has improved- experience is tie best teacher with this disease process.  Good luck."
