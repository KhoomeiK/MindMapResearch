SuicideWatch,fbf7vul,t3_eczf2a,1576803874.0,Agreed. 2019 sucked. I also realized I was worthless and tried to kill myself once in June and again in July. I tried to forget about everything that's happened this year but it's barky worked. My day to day memory has gone to shit though
SuicideWatch,fb8vk32,t3_ebspd5,1576622872.0,Facts. And then they act all shocked and try to give you some bullshit excuse to not kill yourself
SuicideWatch,f8xie7w,t3_e2sokm,1574919770.0,Hey. What's up?
SuicideWatch,f8xi8rw,t3_e2mxjd,1574919623.0,It's not stupid. This past summer I wanted to kill myself but didn't because my favorite music artist said he was coming to my city in October and I wanted to see him before I did. He didn't come but I’m like kind of okay now so it's okay

SuicideWatch,evxlzmr,t1_evxlq1j,1564897304.0,Thank you
SuicideWatch,evxlig2,t1_evxldp1,1564896774.0,I have one friend but I don't want to disturb her and she'd probably tell my parents who would then disown me because they hate people who commit suicide. I honestly think I'm at a point where help is useless. I might stay alive until October because my favorite music artist is coming to my city but I don't know if I can last
SuicideWatch,evxl364,t1_evxkrdy,1564896302.0,Me and my family got into a big fight today and I was supposed to kill myself last night but I didn't because I wanted to see my little cousins for the last time because they were going to come over. My mom basically told me I’m worthless and my dad is just an asshat. So after the fight I stress cleaned my room and kept burning myself with my hair iron to let out frustration. And like I said I've been wanting to die for a while now and I’m debating whether or not to do it
SuicideWatch,evxkm7b,t1_evxkjnp,1564895800.0,Life just sucks. Family and friends are shit and I've been ready to die for a year. This list is a dream that I wish would come true.
