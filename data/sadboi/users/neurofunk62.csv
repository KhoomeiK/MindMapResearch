SuicideWatch,fq9hzld,t1_fq98wyn,1589198815.0,"Look at it this way. Do you feel embarrassed to go to a doctor for a physical health problem, probably not. That's the same for a therapist they are there to help you with mental health problems. Most doctors and therapists do there job to help people, but they do need money for there income to support there family or there own life.
You don't have to feel embarrassed when you say your most deepest feelings and problems to them, they are not there to judge. They try look what the root of the problem is and how to help you to get better.
Also have you tried cbd oil, it's weed extract that won't make you high cause it doesn't contain any thc. But it helps to calm down your mind and let your body and mind feel more grounded. Also I would recommend not taking any psychedelic or weed until your mind is fully grown up, that's around the age of 25.
I'm sorry for your loss of your best friend, I feel your pain I lost 1 friend too cause of suicide and other one who is murdered. 
Try to keep going you are still young and can still change for the better, stay safe and much love"

SuicideWatch,fnr6x7j,t3_fzu0jt,1587180799.0,"The fear of doing something you don't want to do is not uncommen.
You have to know that people who fear of doing something that they don't want, are more likely to don't these things than people who don't want to these things but don't have a fear about it.

I can assure you that if you fear of doing something to a child cause of your sexuallity you defenetly won't do anything.

Look at it this way, an avarage man who likes woman is not going to start randomly raping woman, especially not if he has a fear of doing these things.

These thought loops just exist cause of overworrying. Thoughts are not really you, they come and go, your intention is a lot more real and if your intention is not to hurt anyone than you won't do, especially if you are afraid of hurting anyone.

I understand that you view your sexuallity as something bad. But that shouldn't be any reason for suicide. You are still a human being with some flaws like any other person. Nobody is perfect.
Pls keep going much love"
SuicideWatch,fnr44dq,t1_fl9amp9,1587178829.0,"I get it that you have no motivation to start doing something, But a lot of times things that interest a person takes time, you have to force yourself to do something for a while and see if you like it or not, give these thing a week or more and conclude after that, if you still don't like than stop and look for something else to try.
This might be difficult for depressed people who have an chemical inbalance, but it is possible.
Also doing something doesn't have to be fun, it also is just good for your body and mind to focus on something else than the dwelling thoughts of your depression and boredem.
One more thing a healthy body helps the mind, your mood could change with the things you eat.

These are just suggestions that helped me out of my depression, also don't take to much pills. Talking about this stuff or mededating helps a lot more in the long run."

SuicideWatch,ey5mr0t,t1_ey4hpeh,1566835434.0,"yeah thats true, you never now for sure. But things like hell or heaven just sound too simple and clich√© concepts, and are just sceems invinted by the church to scare of people, there is no one that is judging us, the bigest judge is yourself. 

I was an hardcore Athiest, i believed that there is nothing after dead and u just ceased to exist. And to be honest i still find this kind of dead the most satisfying. 

But now to me this universe seems more like metapisical realm created out of enery that doestn experience time and space. It just exist. 

Just my opinion by things I learned, but honestly I could be completely wrong."
SuicideWatch,ey4gmp9,t1_ey42u93,1566791659.0,"I can assure you almost 99,99% that there is no hell or heaven. But also not nothing, you have had mutliple lifes, this is most likely not your first one. But the thing is when you die you go back to the original source where everyone comes from, this proces will be more diffecult for people who have regrets or guilt. So try to keep living and be as good of person as you can. Life might seem unfair, but  know that your original self beyond this life, chose this life, so you can learn from your emotions and life itself. And when the time comes for you to go, try to let go of everything, people with less regret, sadness and guilt have an easier time of letting life go when they die. 

When you are suicidal you might think that you could easely let go of life, but you have also a subconcuis that might want the opposite. 

Remember that you are not alone, there are a lot of people that have it ways worse than you and yes there are people that also have it better. But in the end almost nobody has it figured out, people that look like they figured it out do are just better actors. Dont compare yourself to society everyone has a different pace in live. Just be honest with yourself, having a good life is not always the same as society portraits it to be."
