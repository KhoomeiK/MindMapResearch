In the end of the day, how someone looks and whether they are perceived as beautiful is highly subjective. People can't objectively find someone beautiful or ugly. It just doesn't make sense. 

Another thing I've learnt is that when I started to get more confident in my skin, I can't across as a more likable person. Confidence really adds to your beauty."

assholedesign,f56gcmx,t1_f5698qz,1572022885.0,"So, I haven't seen too many places in India so my answer is  narrow to my limited knowledge.

The hillstations and places in North India- Kasol, Darjeeling, Ladakh and all are very clean and scenic. The mountains will stun you!

Gangtok in Sikkim (Northeast India) is another scenic place, rich with culture. (Buddhism!)

Coming to central India, Ahmedabad is the most well-structured cities. It's almost like it was created in a simulation. Pune is a quieter city, very lush green and one of those cities where you'll just feel like walking. 

South India has a very digital nomad friendly city- Kochi. Cheap, next to the most beautiful places- Wayyanad, Kodaikanal, Munnar. One town there that is particular known is Fort Kochi, thanks to its art heritage.

Two hillstation in South India that are a must sees are Ooty and Coorg. 

Auroville is another must-visit and ""stay like a local"" cities. It's really cool because it's an experimental township. People from all over the world live there with the entire town believing in a give philosophy (you should read more, my words don't do justice).

And of course, I would always suggest Bangalore,even though it is pollution because of its hustle culture, great eateries and bars, and different kinds of people!

I would say start from the South and work your way up to the North, if you plan to spend time in the country. (And then go to Bhutan). If you want to stay here, most places except for the hillstations are great for long-term stay. Hillstations have poor network, especially the hillstations in the North.

Hope this helped!"
assholedesign,f54fvew,t1_f54f527,1571980792.0,"So, the capital of India is one of the most poluted cities, to the point where smog was very common for a few months back in 2017. Air pollution kills about 1.5million people in the country every year. 

Another city, Bangalore (the San Francisco of India) has traffic so bad that the entire country is well aware of it. I live here and I sit in an hour of traffic for 3kms (1.8miles) everyday. My hometown is much better because fewer cars etc. but you would think metro cities would be better. 

Garbage is super common on the roads. Not seen in highly residential upper class and upper-middle class areas but most other places are littered with garbage. Our garbage pick up system is quite poor. I see slum like areas living with garbage right in front of their homes and the pick up authorities never do anything about it. And this is just where I stay. If you're interested to get a glimpse, you should Google ""Slums in Mumbai garbage"". Lots of articles and photos about it. 

Interesting fact: when India hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010, they hide the slum ridden areas in the city with a bamboo curtain.

I'm not saying India won't get better. We have initiatives to clean up the country but it's a slow road to progress."

Anxiety,f266pyl,t3_dc1s5u,1569995744.0,"Hi I've been in this relationship for 2 years and this constant worrying is something I've been working on since the start. I do two things to manage and deal with it:

1. Ask myself questions like ""Am I reading into this? Is there any logical evidence of him wanting to leave me?"" Questioning yourself lowers the worry. While these weren't helpful in the beginning, they slowly started to work because it became a habit to question my worries.

2. Tell me partner about it as soon as I feel it. Whether it's face to face or through text. I tell him what's worrying me whether it's that I think he wants to leave me or that I think he might be / wanting to cheat on me. And then I say ""I realise this is my anxiety making things up but my brain believes it. I can't make myself change this thinking right now. Could you help?"" Either we just do something together like cuddle or go out or even sit next to each other and work. Or, we talk it out. 

Over the course of the last 6 months (it was really bad 6 months ago), my irrational worrying about him being faithful or wanting to be with me has decreased. 

**P. S. I also go for therapy weekly and that has made a difference.**

Moreover my partner is very open and since he understands, he even says things like ""you can look through my messages if you want"". I don't do it but the statement shows he has nothing to hide. (A way to reassure my worries)

I hope this helps! You're not alone here. ‚ô•Ô∏è We all have these worries. It's only human."

""I should show my happiest moments without any awkwardness or fear because, people prefer to see those, even if they don't say it. Everyone prefers warmth. And if I'm having a bad day, I should tell people I'm commonly around (like at work), that I'm not doing so well today but I'll be okay in a bit. ""

&#x200B;

The biggest characteristic of a warm person is that they are honest and straightforward to the core. It's really tough but I try to be honest, even if it's an uncomfortable topic. For instance, my flatmate was a bit rude to me and I took that personally (even though she was just going through her own issues). At first, I started avoiding her but a few days later, I just decided to do the difficult thing and tell her that this situation made me anxious. Even though it didn't make much of a difference to her, knowing that I could be honest and straightforward helped me feel a little better.
