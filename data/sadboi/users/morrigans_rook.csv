I've never been very close with my dad, and I had no clue how I would move forward without her, my main source of support. It's been a year and a half and it's pretty hard, but things feel normal sometimes, and I have found things that make me happy. I know she would be proud of me. That's what you have to focus on - your mom is so so proud of every day you move forward. Look for the little signs that show she's with you. Wear a piece of her jewelry. Do something she liked to do. I think it's about learning that our loved ones are still with us, just in a different way. Idk though. Message me if you ever need support!"

But I finally went to a therapist about it and learned some ways of thinking that might help, specifically about the fear of getting that feeling at inopportune times.

- Ask yourself, So what if I have to ask to stop to use the bathroom? Is anyone really going to think poorly of you for that? Everyone pees. 
- What's the worst case scenario, peeing in the open? You'll probably never see those people again. 
- Use physical relaxation techniques to help your body be less tense. This can reduce general anxiety. 
- Use mental relaxation techniques to distract you from the anxiety. 
- Remind yourself that your body is healthy and this is just the anxiety making you feel uncomfortable. For me, the urge often goes away if I can talk myself down. 

Basically, it takes a lot of practice (and a lot of car rides, movies, long walks, etc) to retrain your brain. I am still working on it!!"
