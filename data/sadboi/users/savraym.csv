I scrolled for a meta-linguistic explanation like the one above to see if I was missing some cultural component or political reference so I’m glad they asked."

technology,fg2w8ho,t1_fg2dsa7,1580458601.0,"I recently read about Clearview AI breaching the ToS on some very popular social media sites to scrape public photos and develop facial recognition algorithms that they sell, untested for accuracy, to police departments around the country... We need better privacy regulations like yesterday 🥵https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html"

startrek,ew6fehb,t1_ew55yl0,1565166753.0,"I have some feelings. I’m 26, watching it for the first time after all the other treks, and I think it’s... not as good as you think. It’s enjoyable in some respects, but it’s easily the worst series for me. For one thing, the sexism didn’t age well and it reads really blatantly. My partner and I joke that they went “Star Trek is for NERDS! We’ll show ‘em!” with this series lol. It’s all about emotionally stunted, self-righteous, stubborn, willfully ignorant, simplistic, arrogant, my-daddy-says-this-is-my-destiny foolish mediocre dudes and the lady-nipples they stare at. Archer ESPECIALLY is such a Karen 🙄 It honestly makes me so angry to watch and to know that plenty of fans just put up with watching Hoshi and T’Pol have 90% of their screen time be close-up, bare-skin/fitted-clothes elevator-style body shots and all these women’s strengths and powers be conveniently rescinded scene-by-scene so they can be rescued or step aside to let a man save the day 😑 also, the intro is aesthetically and musically inconsistent with the show, all other treks, and general good taste, so it’ll never be right to me but oh well 🤷‍♀️ The lazy DS9/Voyager rewrites bothered me more than a throwaway-but-original episode story would have, as well."
