I think at this point it makes sense to wait for the MBP release no ?"

My therapist now works with psychedelic integration which is cool - he had his own experiences too, mostly aya though. 

In general though I think it‚Äôs fair to advise against self medicating and consuming illicit drugs especially if you‚Äôre sourcing them from someone else... I‚Äôm a fan of mushrooms and lsd myself, but  it‚Äôs best to have proper eligibility analysis (any mental discorder issues in the family, etc) and be given the appropriate dose of the appropriate compound."

infj,exau9fo,t3_cruefe,1566116093.0,"That‚Äôs what I have been struggling with the most lately - deep existential crisis related to my professional career which was one of the triggers of my depression. 

I would say find something that allows you to save and that gives you at least some meaning. I feel the same, it‚Äôs unlikely that there is a job out there that will be meaningful enough for me to feel fulfilled. However if there‚Äôs at least some meaning it will help you keep going and saving will allow you freedom in the future to try something else / start something on your own / take a career break etc 

I think I attach a lot of my purpose and meaning to what I do for a living which isn‚Äôt entirely right either. I liked the title of a book ‚Äúget a life, not a job‚Äù - it resonated. Yes the job is still important and it feels better when it‚Äôs aligned with values but our purpose extends beyond just our work. 

I‚Äôve been working in finance and while I‚Äôve had a tremendous career growth and have earned decent money, I feel so deeply unfulfilled. There‚Äôs part of me that says ‚ÄúI could be doing so much more, something more meaningful, make myself more useful to the world, use my creativity more‚Äù. And yet I get lost in trying to figure out what I should do. I‚Äôm planning on transitioning into the most ethical side of finance (sustainable / green finance , impact investing etc) and then becoming a loud advocate for making the financial industry more responsible in the way it invests - make sure money goes to ethical businesses and sustainable projects and not just those that are most lucrative. And that I feel like I can do outside of my job too, go to events, write, give talks - help bring positive change to this conservative industry and use my creativity in the way I tell stories and trying to bring influential messages. 

Anyway that‚Äôs just my example... think bigger and beyond just your work and find something where work fits into that picture - not the other way around.

PS ultimately I think the self realisation lies in creating and doing something on my own - I‚Äôm very drawn to conscious entrepreneurship. Creating a profitable company that also makes a positive impact in our world"
