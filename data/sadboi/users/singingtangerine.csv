i assume the reason young people get raped more often is that they are just more attractive. 
that, and colleges are just rife with hormones and drunkenness. whose idea was it to put 50+ 20-somethings into a dark basement with loud music and endless alcohol, and without any understanding of how alcohol actually impacts the brain? it doesn’t matter if a sober frat guy wouldn’t rape his friend, a *drunk* one might.

Novel mutations don’t propagate as quickly as you may think. Natural selection only accounts for about 30% of traits seen in humans.

BadMensAnatomy,fq46k74,t1_fq45w25,1589074171.0,"I was (hypothetically) asking why women don’t, since distinguishing shapes would be beneficial for finding food. Strawberries are a different shape than nightshade is, so distinguishing shapes would have been beneficial as well, but this trait didn’t evolve. In men, both shape discrimination and color discrimination would also have been beneficial, because both of these things are necessary for hunting and for running from predators. Essentially, my argument here is that for color discrimination to be evolved in women as a gathering strategy, it would have had to benefit *only women*. But because better color perception would be beneficial to both sexes, there has to be a different reason it is present in women.

And yes, I do believe women are able to see more colors due to the color receptors in their eyes, but I could be wrong. What I know for sure is that women on average have higher vocabularies, which likely leads to us thinking about color differently. Sort of like how in Russian, the colors pink and red are thought of as “the same color” because it’s all the same word (I’d compare this to light blue vs dark blue in English).

Also, women are more likely to be tetrachromats."
BadMensAnatomy,fq3tr19,t1_fq35tjy,1589070163.0,"this isn’t necessarily true, for several reasons. 

1. evolution doesn’t choose between gender based on behavior. this is a poorly worded statement, but the idea is that behaviors that were beneficial to women in hunter-gatherer societies would also have been beneficial to men, and so this begs the question - why didn’t evolution affect men this way? if there’s no downside to men inheriting this, they would have inherited it. it isn’t as if the gene could have been able to differentiate between sexes. the exception to this is obviously sexual selection - so for example, male peacocks have bright colors, because females are continually attracted to male peacocks with bright colors. 

2. if edibility was the issue, why aren’t women more able to see shapes, too? blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries are all shaped differently. shouldn’t women be able to differentiate between these? and wouldn’t distinguishing colors also help men in hunting, because they would be more able to find an animal that is camouflaged.

the more likely explanation for better color vision in women is that it’s a side effect of higher estrogen, or a side effect of any number of characteristics that women also have.

on a similar train of thought, it’s likely that male spatial coordination is also just a side effect of testosterone, not because they were better at hunting.

and yes, you’ll find articles speculating about the “hunter-gatherer” hypothesis that you mentioned. it’s important to note that it hasn’t been proven.

academia,fpx6fiv,t1_fpx2ers,1588976557.0,"I’m about to graduate undergrad in ~10 days. I completely agree. I think it is pointless to force someone into a degree in which they will be unmotivated and/or do poorly just because this is what is expected these days.

I loved college. I only went because I really, *truly* wanted to and knew I would do well. If I thought I would excel as an electrician, a mechanic, or a hairdresser, I would have done that instead. These jobs also require skill and training, and I think it’s ridiculous that they’re being thought of as “worse” just because they don’t require 10-20 page essays. 

So now too many people are entering college because their parents wanted them to, they’re doing poorly, and they’re getting jobs in fields that they don’t give a flying fuck about. And maybe that’s why assignments have gotten easier since my professors were in undergrad (or maybe I’m creating a false correlation)."

neuro,fpx57ci,t1_fpx0e62,1588975880.0,"no, drinking tea or coffee every day isn’t a bad idea. you can get addicted to a lot of things, and they don’t necessarily have to be bad. for example, my mom is addicted to running - she goes for a half hour run every morning, rain or shine. this is good for her! 

I spoke to a professor about a year ago and he mentioned there’s no evidence that caffeine is *bad* for you (in the way that cocaine or heroin are). here’s a sort-of-reputable article on it: https://castlecraig.co.uk/blog/2018/03/26/is-caffeine-dangerous

in addition, unless you’re drinking *heavily* caffeinated matcha, i doubt you will have issues breaking the habit even if you are addicted. for coffee drinkers, I’ve read it takes one to two weeks. if you’re really worried, maybe drink a less caffeinated tea, like an herbal or a white. generally, afaik, the hierarchy of caffeine in tea goes: white/herbal (~0 mg) -> green (~35) -> oolong (50) -> black (~60-90 mg). matcha varies from 30-100 mg AFAIK"
AskMen,fpx2ndm,t1_fpx2j2m,1588974510.0,"oh, i mean, yes of course they could. i misspoke - i meant if someone were taking it as prescribed, they could not get addicted."
AskMen,fpvy10l,t1_fpvxtjw,1588953865.0,this is why i said that everyone is different and that medication doesn’t work for everyone. and why i said the commenter should speak to a therapist about options.
AskMen,fpvwdou,t1_fpvv2rq,1588953027.0,"so i feel like this is a common misconception. Everyone is different, of course, and medication doesn’t work for everyone. (this is because there are dozens of individual factors that affect how medication might work. but we know the general idea of what is needed and what will help.)

but you are not going to get addicted - that’s impossible, because the medication is in too small a dose. think of it this way. is a person with diabetes “addicted” to insulin injections? no. their body just doesn’t produce insulin correctly, so they have to supplement with outside sources. 

similarly, the brain of a person with ADHD doesn’t regulate dopamine production correctly. dopamine is a chemical that is *necessary* for brains to work normally, but people with ADHD just can’t use it properly. it’s a body malfunction.
so, very often, someone who has ADHD needs to take something like adderall to help regulate it properly for them. this isn’t a sign of addiction, it’s restoring “balance” to a brain that wasn’t balanced in the first place.

your parents probably don’t understand medication and don’t know what it does. that’s normal in older generations and there’s not much to be done about it, unfortunately. if i were you i would try to convince them to see a therapist or psychiatrist - they could at least give some pointers on how to deal with your situation.

edit: i mean you cannot get addicted *if you take it as prescribed*."

i had assumed you’d accepted your second choice already, and were planning on changing your mind last-second. yeah, you’re right, people typically interview at many schools and choose just one advisor with whom to interview.

i would still let them know just so they’re in the loop."
gradadmissions,fpp8pb1,t3_gepe7x,1588797884.0,"1. you absolutely should let your advisor know. it is not polite or to my knowledge accepted to secure an advisor then drop them just because your top school accepted you.

2. i don’t think COVID should be that big a deal. if i can’t attend school in september (and it looks like i will be able to), i planned with my advisor to do it remotely. i really don’t think we will be in quarantine for much longer. grad degrees take years, don’t let this change your whole decision.

3. also, i’m just curious - when is the deadline for accepting a school’s invitation to attend the program? how have you put off making a decision this long?"
