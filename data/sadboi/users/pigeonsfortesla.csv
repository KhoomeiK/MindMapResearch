dogs,f5z4bfa,t3_dpnmdw,1572566765.0,"I was at my brother in law's place. He has a malamute/husky cross. While I was there, I found out my mom (about a 4 hour drive away) had to put down one of our family dogs, with whom I was deeply bonded. I sat on the floor and cried. When the malamute came in from outside, he just immediately walked up to me and put his nose against my heart.

We don't deserve dogs."

whatsthisbug,ez0ndh0,t1_ez01tp0,1567639277.0,I'm not sure. There are a lot of spiders that look similar to this one but not the same. Coloring on trachelas tranquillis in the google image aearch is not the same as this one. Also legs are different? Talk to me I know zero about creep ass spiders

Endo,erwopi6,t3_c44e52,1561350392.0,"I found that eventually it did nothing for me either. But a hot water bottle for some reason was more effective.  I mean honestly before I started taking Visanne I was taking morphine the pain was so bad (and absolutely nothing else worked- including demerol, percocet, codeine, naproxen, other anti-inflammatories, and more). However the hot water bottle always gave at least a little relief."

skyrim,erexzmn,t1_erehbgt,1560795471.0,"I think it happened when I saved. We were standing on a slanted rock, from what I've heard that can make this happen. I had to go back to an earlier save because we would fly like this for a bit and then just die like we had fallen off a mountain. I love this game as much for the glitches as anything else"

dogs,eqdu0vw,t3_by5228,1559995026.0,"I lost my girl last July. I cried every day for months. I still miss her and I still cry for her, but I am able now to celebrate her life and at least feel a bit of joy and gratitude that we has the bond we did. No other dog will ever replace her, and I'm still not ready to get another. Her brother is still with us and his grief was so hard to witness. I know the healing process is still going on for me, and I am in a place where I can just accept it. This would be my advice to you: be sad. Let yourself feel however you feel for as long as you feel it. Go easy on yourself. One day you won't cry. Then two days. Then you'll see something that reminds you of him and you'll cry again and you know what? It's ok. Hang in there, allow yourself to grieve. I am so sorry for your loss."
