I can strongly relate to the cons. From my experience, my ISTJ partner can be incredibly stubborn and stick to his judgements, even when proven wrong (which honestly isn’t very often). However, he’s quite understanding of my sensitivity so he will apologise later if he’s disregarded my point of view. I can also confirm that ISTJ partner helps me with organisation and encourages me not to procrastinate, and likewise he believes he has become more empathetic and less serious since being with me."

SuicideWatch,fa8rej3,t3_e5tfi6,1575852883.0,I felt the same until I got together with my boyfriend about 6 months ago- it’s honestly made things more difficult because I know he wouldn’t be able to cope with my death. I’ve never worried about my future before and it’s actually very terrifying.
