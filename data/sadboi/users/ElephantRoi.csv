AmItheAsshole,etgsg4u,t3_cbiv9h,1562797888.0,"NTA. Your kids should get to feel special on their birthdays. Especially if money isn’t the issue here. I’m confused as to why your wife is so opposed to it in the first place.
I know your kids will appreciate it. My mom shares a birthday with her younger brother. She once told me how her mom always made it clear that it wasn’t “their birthday” it was her birthday and his birthday, and I could tell that she really appreciated the effort her mom put into that. And my birthday is close to three of my siblings’ birthdays. We didn’t have big parties every year, but when we did have parties they were always separate. I have very different interests from those siblings and joint parties would’ve sucked."

Catholicism,et8034u,t1_et7ywtf,1562542792.0,"Something important to remember is that, even if we can’t consider the Bible a “rule book” (which is difficult mainly because it can be interpreted several ways), Catholics do have a rule book, the Catechism. It lays out the teachings of the Church clearly, and the Catechism says that homosexual sex is wrong."

casualiama,et576q4,t1_et4n1yi,1562465828.0,"Very overwhelming for sure. I was late to a few classes because I was struggling with my lock since I’d never had to deal with one before, thankfully my teachers were cool about it. I went to a small high school so it helped, people noticed I was new and tried to help me. Luckily everyone was very nice so it wasn’t terrible, but I’d never experienced anything quite like it."
Anxiety,et3drr9,t1_et38m60,1562431916.0,I do this too. I get so overwhelmed by everything I want to get done that I can’t even get out of bed to go do it.
Anxiety,esyk02f,t1_esyhki2,1562344596.0,"Thanks! Best of luck to you, hopefully we can both keep putting ourselves out there."
AmItheAsshole,esybh11,t3_c9gtj9,1562341430.0,"NTA. Sounds like they’re perfectly capable of sending the kid to daycare, they may not like it but if they’re that opposed then the wife can work from home. It’s absolutely not the same situation as your other grandchild and if your son can’t accept that then he’s the asshole."
Anxiety,esyapot,t3_c9brki,1562341165.0,I feel this way too. I have basically no solid relationships because I’m always too anxious to approach people and ask them to hang out or I feel like I’m just annoying to everyone. It’s tough and gets lonely. I’m trying to force myself to try harder despite my anxiety. I have to believe that it gets better if we keep trying.
Anxiety,esx02lb,t3_c9d6lr,1562323413.0,That does kind of make sense. There might be other reasons though. Like I always sit with my legs crossed and I think it’s because I want to take up as little space as possible so no one notices me and I stay out of everyone’s way.
unrequited_love,eswwn3f,t1_esvl7gv,1562321899.0,"Thanks. I doubt that’s what it is but who knows, right? If I see him again this summer I’ll try to tell him."
unrequited_love,esuyu79,t1_esuwa8b,1562291056.0,"Thank you. I think I will tell him, if I get the chance. You’re right, I need to know."
