If I lie back with my head on my arm the buggers come round the back and still make their way into my eye! I think they’re trying to get inside cos they know where the good shit is."
aeroponics,fqpiv6w,t1_fqpef1k,1589547469.0,"Hi, I ended up buying from Agrotonomy and it all seemed legit. They asked for payment by bank transfer, which I did and sent them the receipt. They then sent the tower garden to the U.K. and it works great and the representative was really helpful and responsive. We were supposed to get ph+/- solutions but they didn’t arrive (I think we just may have received extra nutrients by mistake, perhaps the bottles look similar...), but this wasn’t really a problem. The main thing was we got the tower garden, and we now have kale and chard and basil and lettuce growing in or house, which is pretty magical. 

So tl;dr I have used Agrotonomy and would recommend."

Acid,fnehlau,t3_g10s1h,1586889507.0,"She might just be worried if she doesn’t understand the positive benefits of it and misunderstands the perceived “risks”. If you want to help her understand it might be worth getting really informed about the lack of risk involved and the benefits of it and sharing this with her. the book Acid Test is really informative for a start and also showing her some of the research on psychedelics from Jons Hopkins, Imperial College London, a site called Drug Science which somewhere has a graph of the most harmful drugs. LSD is one of the least harmful, not as low risk as psilocybin but down there. Alcohol is pretty close to the most harmful, if not THE most I can’t remember the details. Puts things in perspective. 
I don’t know if this is helpful, it just came to my mind that she might be scared because she doesn’t understand it. But then it doesn’t sound like a lot of the experiences you had were things it would be easy to understand if you hadn’t experienced them.
I hope she figures out a way to understand your perspective! I’m sorry you didn’t get the response you needed in the past. Make sure to keep doing what feels right for you regardless of anyone else’s opinion. Thinking of you. Much love x"

EatingDisorders,fihbt93,t3_f4yy4o,1582408559.0,"That’s incredible work that you’ve come so far on your own in circumstances that must feel so difficult and unsupportive of recovery! Not purging alone is such a big step and your body will be so grateful. It’s such a stress on our poor digestive systems not to mention our teeth! 
I stopped purging ten years ago but still restricted for a long time in various ways. About a year ago I discovered Kayla Rose Kotecki on YouTube and she talks about letting go of all restriction. Even keto or Atkins or raw til 4 or whatever diet’s got you. I’d highly recommend watching her videos, even if you don’t feel inspired to go “all-in” yet. She speaks a lot of sense and there’s a lot of support on her channel. As does Elisa Oras. And I totally recommend following body-positive queeeeeens such as Iskra Lawrence and Ashley Graham who radiate beauty.
You deserve total nourishment and total health. I know how much work it takes to get from where you’ve been to where you’ve got to and I admire your strength and courage. That’s why I thought it worth mentioning this here, you can get even further when you feel ready. You’ve proved you have it in you to fight and I hope for you that you’ll keep going and keep expanding your comfort zone little by little. It’s really rough that your mum has brought you into her world of insecurities. But that’s her problem and by making yourself healthy and well you’re saying a massive FUCK YOU to her insecurities. Maybe one day she’ll have the courage to fight them too. I love you, you’ve got this. Keep fighting! X"
BodyAcceptance,fi3x7gb,t3_f64vgt,1582129547.0,"Hi, I’m sad to hear you’re feeling insecure and I don’t know if I can say anything that will help, but my thoughts are... how do you feel in yourself? Are your boyfriend’s comments about other women/girls making you feel insecure because you’re unsure of his love for you, or because you’re not secure in yourself and his comments are triggering that? If the former/you’re not sure of his love for you maybe reflect on whether he js also complimentary about you and who you are and the way you look? Does he show/express his love for you? Because if so then hopefully he knows that he’s lucky to have you and maybe he’s just a bit immature and insensitive re: fancying other women (we’re all human, I’m sure you have celebrity crushes or whatever, but the point here is whether in spite of that you’re confident in his commitment to loving you). If it’s the latter and you’re not secure in yourself then we gotta build your confidence gurl! You’ve gotta be writing love notes to yourself and making a list of all the things you love about yourself, material or spiritual or emotional or social or whatever you got, and stand in front of a mirror every morning and repeat that damn list to yourself! Maybe you start of with a things you like about yourself and maybe in a few weeks you’re showering yourself with love. But turn that inner voice into your own personal cheerleader because you’ve got to live your whole life with your inner voice so she’s got to be kind to you, she’s got to be building you up and not tearing you down. These are some of my thoughts, I don’t know if they make sense to you... and if your boyfriend isn’t treating you like the absolute beautiful boss you are then what is it you’re getting out of your relationship? I guess what I’m saying is your relationship with yourself needs to be affirming and your relationship with your partner likewise needs to be affirming. Sending you lots of love. X"
enfj,fi1t61p,t3_f5s4pp,1582064275.0,"I’ve found it important to learn self-care and boundaries. I had a very people-facing role too and I’ve had to take a break from it because it felt like all of my energy was being poured into a black hole and I didn’t feel I was getting much in return. So I decided to change that and take some time to myself. Give yourself permission to look after yourself and give yourself the care you give others! I find it really difficult to say no to people when they want to hang out. I tried waking up in the morning and saying “no no no no no. No!” Out loud just to kinda rehearse saying it. Still saying yes to the things I want to say yes to, just not saying yes out of a sense of obligation. It’s important to look after yourself in whatever way works best for you. Your only purpose is to look after yourself, anyone else is a bonus."
Purpose,fi1oqle,t3_dhwglf,1582061829.0,"I’ve had a similar feeling and I appreciate that acid gives you a clarity of insight into the purpose of many things so it can feel frustrating when it feels like this is being withheld from you. It might be worth asking this to r/Acid as I’m sure a few people in there might have some insight. 
When I take LSD I am always open and hoping to have my purpose revealed and I get a lot of motherhood imagery, love for humanity trying to express itself in the form of motherly love, almost like a literal/biological purpose. As I’m ambivalent about whether I’d like children I feel like this is a huge cosmic giggle at my expense haha, too literal a purpose. So I try to deal with the not-knowing by carrying on doing what I enjoy, trying new things that are appealing to me, not putting pressure on myself to make money from these means and trying to trust in the universe or whatever to present my path to me someday, and for now work on being content with what I have now. I started reading a lot of Buddhism and stuff on the noble eightfold path is pretty decent, I feel better when I try to live without ill-will towards people, without dishonesty, without taking what’s not given to me, stuff like that. I don’t know if this is at all useful to you or the kind of answer you were looking for but I wish you every luck in your search fellow human! Take it easy on yourself while you’re figuring it out. Much love"

ramdass,f1574wy,t3_buqd99,1569185691.0,"He says souls are working out their drama through ego special relationships, whether romantic or not. But he warns against becoming attached to form. For example when we grieve the loss of a loved one, if they die or our relationship with them ends, it is because we have got attached to their form, which is our ego’s attraction. We’ve become identified with the attractions or aversions of our ego, so we need to work on extracting ourselves from those.

“The mind has veiled the heart from its boundless merging with everything in the universe. And we are like in a prison room and when we fall in love with somebody it takes us out into the sunlight again. We come back into the place in ourselves where we feel at home, safe and loving.”

I think it was mentioned in a previous reply that he says falling in love with somebody is allowing us to access that part of ourselves that IS love. But we get attached to the external form of another and think that we love them, as separate beings. I think if you’re able to be in a romantic relationship and identify that your partner allows you to experience love and that that feeling is in YOU rather than attached to them then you’re on rainbow road. And I think he says in  this context that approaching a relationship in this way moves you away from feeling “I love you” (separate) to “we are in love together” (we are both experiencing this place in ourselves that is love).

“You both tasted being one in love, but then (in grief) what you’re missing is the other person. But at some point there will come a moment (watching a sunset, sitting quietly) and you will suddenly taste the fact that the love you had with that person is still there. And in that moment you will start to make the break between the vehicle for coming into the love and the essence, or the method and the essence. What truly connected you to that person was that quality of identity in the quality of love.
Relationship goes from a path in which there is incredible need because we are hungry ghosts in need of love, and as the path works and we start to come into love we start to rest in it and then relationship becomes a celebration. It no longer is needful, it’s the play of form.

You move through love into love.”
