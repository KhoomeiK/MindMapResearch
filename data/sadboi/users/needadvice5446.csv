I wish it worked this way! Please don’t buy into any gadgets or face tools - these are scams and a waste of your money. I’m afraid that without targeted cosmetic procedures that are designed to sculpt specific facial features, the only way to lose weight in your face is to simply lose weight and your face will too."

askwomenadvice,fnvcp10,t3_g3u1uk,1587288321.0,Please please find a new doctor. I know it’s a hassle and the new one may be farther away but you’ll have peace of mind and be in better hands. I had a similar experience with a very religious older obgyn who assumed I was catholic bc she also treated my mom. She so refused to give me an std test (bc apparently it wasn’t possible after the pap?? I found out later that’s not true) a year or so later I ended up in the ER with PID due to an undiagnosed STI that developed into a giant abscess and almost obstructed my bowel. I had to have emergency surgery and stayed in the hospital for a week on antibiotics. It was such a traumatic experience having to explain to my parents what had happened. I never had one symptom prior to ending up in the hospital either. Bottom line that i learned that day: be your own advocate when your doctor won’t. And that’s okay if it means finding a new doctor.

Trying not to think about it doesn’t help bc the thoughts become more powerful. The only thing that’s helped me is to stop these thoughts dead in their tracks and counter them with acknowledgement.

Yep just happened again” and reminding myself what’s happening in the moment. “Right now I am safe, I am in good health, I am okay. My family is okay”. Naming them for what they are gives them less power and  has helped me to gain some distance from the ruminating/spiraling I’m so great at.

It’s common knowledge that to lose weight you must burn more calories than you consume - but this is hard to guess at. It’s easy to think “man I’m wiped from all that exercise!” and easily consume more calories than you actually need. For example there are hidden calories everywhere (sugary sports drinks, sodas, salad dressing) and you may be eating calorie dense things without realizing the quantity (nuts or cooking with way too much oil for example). Use myfitness pal or another calorie tracker to log your meals and ensure you’re doing this each day (in a way that’s healthy and sustainable for you based on what your body needs)."

That’s how I eventually found some really good products I prefer over the animal based versions. For other things it’s harder and so those will just be the last to go.

I know that buying more makeup won’t help me use what I have so that’s enough to deter me, but apart of me does miss the novelty of “shiny new things.” The thing is I know even not buying new makeup for the next say, decade there’s still no way I could successful use up 8 blushes or whatever it is I have. And that’s a bit discouraging (and feels wasteful) because i know the only way to get down to the fantasy “one makeup bag” would require a declutter or toss the ones I won’t use."

running,ff454k5,t1_ff20puy,1579555748.0,I think this is my favorite thing I’ve read on the internet this month!! As someone who is new to running and finds it pretty challenging I can see myself doing this...
relationships,ff1bygq,t1_ff0vhx9,1579477314.0,I had the same thoughts. Super strange that mom glossed over the huge red flag that that one day her child’s personality seemingly changed overnight without any further prompting or investigation...
MakeupRehab,fel7a9d,t3_epeuzz,1579215590.0,I’ve been wearing makeup for 15+ years and I curl my eyelashes every single day before applying mascara. Never had any issues whatsoever. Just be gentle and use it correctly.
AnimalsBeingDerps,f4nwtoc,t3_dl5b80,1571693918.0,NooOOooo I’m so sorry. Just from this pic I can tell you probably made a lot of fun memories with her!
PanPorn,f3alyvq,t1_f3alv4v,1570779496.0,Agreed. I love how buildable they are ! I’ve never found the appeal of a super pigmented blush.
PanPorn,f392ln7,t3_dfq428,1570742917.0,You may be the only person in history to keep trying to pan a tarte blush after “Paarty” /s. ;)
PanPorn,f392ade,t3_dfxdx8,1570742811.0,"Omg I panned two bb blushes (in Slopes - I swear they changed the color on me - and Nude Peach) in my 33 years on this earth and for some reason thought it was smart to immediately rephrase, completely ignoring my growing makeup collection. Years later here I am with 5 of these bad boys and no pans in sight.  I actually think i have this color, like i bought it on sale on the website on a whim! This has inspired me to give them more love. CONGRATS!"

loseit,f26x18z,t3_dc36te,1570025568.0,"I’m afraid what you’re describing is really common for many people. Kind of like redoing the exterior of an old car with a new body and paint, if the motor is still rusty and the oil hasn’t been changed, the car isn’t going to run just because it looks new. You have to be willing to do the work to address your internal state, the self esteem issues, the decades of self doubt.... It’s a set up for disappointment to think that just because you’ve changed your appearance that your emotional state will will automatically change as well. Even the best set of abs doesn’t guarantee you a healthy sense of self esteem if it wasn’t there to begin with."
muacjdiscussion,f1xa4jh,t1_f1x93lt,1569795750.0,Thanks for that info!
muacjdiscussion,f1x2vao,t1_f1vbrm2,1569792951.0,I’ve heard of alcohol being unkind to skin but may i ask what’re fatty alcohols?
muacjdiscussion,f158rb6,t1_f156w46,1569186318.0,So weird ! If you’ve ever tried to remove the rest of your face makeup or wash your face but not your eyes you quickly realize it’s a lot more work than just removing your dang eye makeup! At least that’s what I found to be true....people be whacky !
muacjdiscussion,f151syx,t1_f14g9y5,1569183669.0,Wtf. Not even trying to be funny but this almost feels like body dysmorphia type territory. There’s literally no reason not to wash off your eye makeup. She could get that same look easily each day just by adding falsies...most people are aware the eye area is such a delicate and sensitive area...why do anything to potentially cause an issue there...not to mention washing your FACE is like basic hygiene 101...
