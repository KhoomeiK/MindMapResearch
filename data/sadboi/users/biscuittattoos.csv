1. I personally find them to be a great way of tapping into that hidden resource of creativity, you just have to take the right kinda dose.
I actually took way more than I usually would on this trip and things got a little crazy but once I regained the use of my limbs this began to form.

I’d recommend looking into microdosing maybe, it’s meant to unlock your brain without the crazy visuals.

I’ve been doing them every few weeks recently and i feel like I’ve been more creative than ever.


2. The actual animation took me about 48hrs of trial and error working out how to use procreates animation tools but once I got the hang of it it came pretty quickly. The song was written in a few hours and the drawing for it has been going on for the last few weeks on and off.
I drew up a storyboard first and then animated frames based on the thumbnails.

3. I created the tune on my keyboard then put it into GarageBand whilst still tripping. The storyboard came weeks later. I’d spoke to a few friends who animate and they loved the idea but couldn’t get involved for a while due to other commitments so I’m the end I storyboarded it with pro create on my iPad.


I used an 8bit image converter online to simplify my drawings and then went back into procreate to create each scene. It’s the first time I’ve tried it so it probably took longer than needed but once I had a few scenes I put it into iMovie and pieces it all together there :)"

NarcissisticAbuse,fomvncz,t1_fomtlfu,1587905267.0,"Bad dreams were often the beginning of what I knew was gonna be a horrible few days, I’d say 90% of the attacks were due to dreams she had about me cheating or leaving her.

She was like a ticking time bomb. She hasn’t been able to get near me to physically hurt me but she’s done nearly everything in her power to ruin my life. The first thing she did was run crying to our friends and tell them all I abused her (something she’d promised to do if I ever left her) etc and by the time I reached out to any of them they had already made up their minds that I was the abuser and accused me of trying to hurt her more than I already have etc when I broke down about it to them.


She’s in her final year of a fine art degree and focused all of her art from what Ive seen on me and my abuse to her (all false, all the other way round). I blocked her contact on every platform, change my number etc and she still manages to send me abuse from different accounts. 


She has all my clothes and belongings/valuables at what was our home but has told me if I even attempt to get them back she’ll contact my sons mother and make sure I never see him again.

I told her I’d go ahead and report the violence/abuse to the police if she doesn’t leave me to get on with my life and she told me if I did she’d call the police on every petty crime anyone close to me has ever committed (things like my friend having a single weed plant in his house). I feel pretty helpless and without any of my clothes or valuables I don’t feel like I have an identity anymore.

I’ve had a lot of Health issues leading upto and since the discard and every now and then she’ll tell me she hopes I have got cancer or she can’t wait till I die of corona etc.

I don’t think I’ll be hearing from her again if I don’t report her to the police or attempt to get my things now and I’m finding it a lot easier to get through the day knowing she won’t message me.


Sorry to rant but yeh she’s made things pretty unbearable in the months since we separated!
