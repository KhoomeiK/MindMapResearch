It is a caring act for her to call somebody to check on you. She honestly sounds like she is in over her head though and needs to be honest and create clear boundaries. You need to ask when to expect a reply and what is okay.  It's ok to do that. Scary but you need to because you are having flashbacks and stuff and that is horrible.

You set your boundaries before you even started on your journey into marriage. You did the right thing. If you had said ""if you cheat on me, I will divorce you"" and then that was the case here, everybody would say yes go for it. 

In this case you are doing something to save your own mental wellbeing and take care of yourself. You know your limits and know that the child would not have a good time living with you - you cannot take care of the child. 

You did a good thing. Kids are loud and noisy and unpredictable and can be sensory overload to somebody that is not a person with autism so I can only imagine. 

The fact that you bought up divorce casually is nothing. People are leaning in the assumption of the idea of tradition and bonds that maybe you cannot relate to right now - that is okay. That is between you and your wife to work around and your wife knows you better than anybody.

An alternative would be to say to try and look after the child for a little while and see how it goes. Ir try parenting classes to see If you are able to deal with it.

It is time to stop giving a fuck, and live for yourself. If you can not live for yourself for you, live for yourself for me. I get it"
TalkTherapy,fqlh7r8,t3_gjgtr1,1589458018.0,"Just ask. You don't go to a medical doctor with a bone out of place and not ask ""what is wrong with it"". This is your brain. If they do not answer because they do not think it beneficial for your health, and continue not to answer claiming anything that is not 100% a clear statement then I would fire them. Both ""how does it make you feel"", no ""why is this important"" - none of that. This is not an analytical moment. 

The thing is that you may disagree and that is because you know you better than anybody. And then...you may change your mind. For instance I will tell you I do not have an eating disorder until I am blue In the face, but i have been in inpatient treatment for controlled restoration of my weight and health 4 or 5 times and in therapy for a couple years and in a hospital bed being told I am going to die from the concequences of my eating disorder. So, ya know.... 

It IS just a label and if you keep poking at it you hear things you do not want to hear. You get desperate to label it and put a name on it for a stage and then at some point you want to wipe that name away and have an identity with out. 

However being informed and educated and being in a wise minded place in your treatment and involved in the health decisions for your healing is a good thing. It is proactive and wise. It keeps you in control and makes you feel confident and not dependent on a therapist or doctor and in my opinion makes the therapy process less messy. They see us for an hour and imagine we are struggling for that hour - we struggle all week long. We have to be our own therapist all week long, so we need something to work with. Always ask"

pittsburgh,fqjf370,t1_fqic3kq,1589409042.0,"That is the messege of AA - that you need to ultimately put AA ahead of anything else including your family. The program must come before all else, or you will drink. This makes sense in the way they explain it in that it is this or death, and I am not downplaying the importance of addiction meaning you need to do something or it leads to death - but if you commit to AA please keep it mind that people will think that you put it before anything else, because....you will. Before you were putting alcohol before them, but people don't mind that so much, because you were drinking with them. 

Anyhow. Try intherooms. I have been using that. And the online meetings are good - but meetings in person will be better.  I don't prescribe to the whole aa messege - I used to. But I do attend meetings and find them very useful and have years of sobriety and have never been rejected by anybody at a meeting- they are kind hearted, wonderful people. Congrats on stopping. You done did a good thing."

Tampons. Not dildos."

politics,fqhqiyr,t1_fqhgv7t,1589382378.0,"I am the king of words. The president of words. I sent words to the states. They asked for words, I sent them words. They said they did not have enough words, and I sent them a tremendous amount of words. Nobody could make that amount of words they said. I made the words. They call it a dictionary, I hear. People have never heard of such a thing. I had them make trillions of dictionaries. I had the people who draw for a living make dictionaries. I sent them to the states. They will tell you they didn't get the words. They didn't even need the words. Some states sent the words back. Nasty words from the fake words press. They told me they love the words. Nobody is using kind words now. I own the words. I am keeping the words. We started with no words."
BPD,fqhq4o3,t1_fqhoq0n,1589382145.0,"""We as a community""

I am in a community. Any ""you"" after that is aimed at anybody with bpd. I am fine. I do not need to meditate on this. I am quite versed in my disorder."
BPD,fqhpoj1,t1_fqhjyio,1589381886.0,I am not upset. I am sighing because I am not upset and this isn't  a thing. It isn't a symtom of bpd to abuse somebody. It is a stigma. It is why if I say I have bpd people assume I will manipulate or hurt them when in my truth I am terrified of getting hurt because I assume everybody will not hurt me and so give everything I have and then apologise when they ask for more and I have nothing.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fqhdzp4,t1_fqhduq5,1589374946.0,Lol yes! Until the boss *accidentally* discloses it to cause people to work harder and competition between staff.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fqhc4dz,t1_fqhaa3j,1589373714.0,"The lesson is you are going to work hard for what you get and think that you are being paid fairly and you sit happily with your candy and one day, you realise that MF next to you, who watches YouTube all day and eats chips really loudly at his desk? He gets paid double for putting half the amount of work in. And you still have your candy, and you have to decide whether it is worth it...."
unpopularopinion,fqh6hfz,t1_fqh66zz,1589369324.0,Lol. Yes I am evil. You know all about me. I grew up in a house where I wasn't raised at all. I am not morally superior to anyone. I'm kind of a terrible person. So thanks. Sorry I insulted you. I didnt mean to. I know everyone suffers. I am sorry your dad didnt spend time with you and. That your mum was distant. My parents sucked too.
atheism,fqh6871,t3_gilzun,1589369093.0,"It upsets me so much, and breaks my heart that people are so desperate and that people use religion to fool them into relying on them to think they are well and can get well by having faith, and then when they are not well they just did not have faith. I have ptsd from trauma and as a teen who lived in an abusive home I took it upon myself to attend a christian therapist in a church. I was ""acting out"" and sad and depressed and angry. They said I was still those things because I did not have enough faith. Maybe they could have helped me out with the guy who I informed them was beating me and hurting me in other ways at home instead of victim blaming and giving me my first taste of survivor's guilt at 15. 

If anything, I get the desperation to just have something to cling to. But my anger and heartbreak is so, so justified. And I have not seen it handled correctly even by pastors who do not preach faith healing and miracles and encourage modern medicine etc. If god is done with miracles and plagues and that was OT, and jesus made it all kosher then stop saying god is testing our faith and weaving things we cannot understand. No."
unpopularopinion,fqh5c9e,t3_gitbcx,1589368292.0,The very fact that all you have been done is been torn down by women is the reason you need to start bringing up other women. It is to end the bullshit women tearing down eachother - not an anti man situation. This is how this started.
politics,fqh4vns,t1_fqgy0ra,1589367864.0,"I never heard such words before, might have been told them at some point, somebody showed me them. They sent me them - a coworker mentioned them. Tell me when the person wrote them. I invented words. 

I wrote them. Thank me. I am great. Keep this post great. Here is a video of people saying how great I am, that people put together in a few minutes of spare time and surprised me with, after I had a tantrum and threatened a world war if nobody told me how great I was. I didn't know how great I was - these people did!"
BPD,fqh3tzw,t1_fqfx162,1589366868.0,Thankyou for clarifying.
