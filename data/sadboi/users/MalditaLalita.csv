My app and lots (for me) of EWCM yesterday told me it was O day but my opk's failed to reflect that. So what do I believe? We've been having sex every other night and my husband tried to initiate it last night but I was sad at my bodys mixed signals and cried silently while he tried to comfort me. But then he pinched my nipple and I elbowed him away. Ugh. He's trying (and bumbling like any man) and I feel bad for being a pissy cunt but I feel powerless to stop it because of all this stress.
