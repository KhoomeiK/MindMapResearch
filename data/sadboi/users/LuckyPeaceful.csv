EDAnonymous,fqmna6k,t3_gjjsgo,1589480284.0,"Hey - speaking as someone who is really obese - you are not a terrible person for having these thoughts. You have repeatedly experienced trauma at the hands of people who all have a certain characteristic in common. Naturally your brain will therefore associate all people who have this characteristic with the traumas you experienced. It's a survival mechanism - your brain is trying to help you identify danger so you can avoid being hurt again. Of course, the rational part of your brain knows that it isn't as simple as fat person=bad person, but that traumatised part of your brain desperately wants to feel safe and feels like it has to take extreme measures to be protected. I have the same thing/fear (not exactly fear, but you know what I mean) about blonde, blue-eyed women for the same sort of reasons. To reiterate, you are not a terrible person for feeling like this; on the contrary, the fact you have the self-awareness to recognise this is a product of trauma and is not always reality is a sign that you are a good person. Unfortunately I cannot offer any advice as to mental healthcare since during this coronavirus crisis it would probably be next to impossible to get an in-person appointment. But it is worth trying to get telephone appointments until in-person ones are a safe possibility again."

SkyrimMemes,fqlmf06,t3_gjiagu,1589461661.0,"I actually read an interesting comment on the Steam Community that made a case for killing Paarthurnax. To sum it up - Paarthurnax says Alduin claiming to be a god is why he betrayed Alduin, but the tablets on the way up to High Hrothgar say Kyne got involved and got Paarthurnax to give men the Thu'um. So (depending on who you believe) Paarthurnax wasn't 100% willing to betray Alduin and was forced to do so due to intervention from a higher power... which suggests he would have continued helping Alduin and killing/enslaving mortals were it not for Kyne. The only way he has been able to overcome his innate nature - the one you share - the one to dominate and to lead - is by living in seclusion. Once you've defeated Alduin, Paarthurnax is back in contact with other dragons and states his intentions to lead them again. He *says* he will unite them under the Way of the Voice, but if the only way he's been able to achieve this is by being utterly isolated for hundreds of years, leaving that seclusion is a bit like giving a recently recovering alcoholic free reign in a liquor shop. There is every chance Paarthurnax's willpower will break and he will revert to his old ways. So killing Paarthurnax may not be what you want to do, but it is what you *have* to do."

This is really only my second time playing - I only started playing Skyrim a few months ago as I couldn't afford anything that could handle the game, so I'm super late to all of this. I had about 80 hours in the first playthrough and tried to do battle-mage and two-handed, but realised I'd made a mistake and just wasn't enjoying it. Much happier with my current choices. So far I haven't finished the main quest and I'm going to leave the Civil War alone until I'm done with that. I haven't finished any major questlines except for the DLCs and I'm so so excited to see where the different guilds take me!!

Fresh/Perishable food: anything (relatively) long lasting - potatoes, onions, apples, oranges, eggs, chorizo rings (the slices go off faster), big tub of Greek yoghurt.

Frozen food: berries, any veg you use regularly (I'm a big fan of frozen spinach, peas, and sweetcorn), meat, 'treat' food like turkey dinosaurs, fish fingers (who says self-isolation food has to be boring and nutritious all the time?)

Dried food/fruits/nuts: prunes, raisins, figs, goji berries, almonds, brazil nuts, peanuts, jerky, other cured meat

Rice/Pulses/Cereals: rice (bought a big 10kg bag from lidl), oats, cornmeal/polenta, instant mash, any pasta or beans you use regularly (it's not something I eat often so I don't have much - just adjust this list to work for your everyday diet)

Jarred food and spreads: Nutella, jam, peanut butter, honey, pickled vegetables (right now I have beetroot, cornichons, and red cabbage)

Tinned food: vegetables (sweetcorn, peas, carrots, potatoes, whatever you eat), tuna/sardines/mackerel in OIL (keeps longer), chicken, pease pudding (not everyone is a fan, I like it), chopped/whole tomatoes, fruit (peaches, pineapple, mandarin), any soups you like, evaporated milk, condensed milk

Baking supplies: brown and white bread flour, yeast sachets, white and brown sugar, plain flour

Other: any beverages you consume regularly (fizzy drinks, juice, milk - get UHT or powdered, tea), condiments, vegetable/olive oil, bouillon, salt, herbs and spices

Household supplies: toilet paper (I know, I know), toothpaste, mouthwash, deodorant, paracetamol and cough syrup to alleviate symptoms, bin bags, kitchen roll, tissues, handwash or bars of soap, hand cream (your hands will be dry from all that washing), laundry detergent.

Building/Crafting (I use this order pretty much every game):- Metal workshop- Crowbar and shovel (shovel might seem like an unnecessary waste, but it is a weapon and I find it helpful in the early game when there are no guns but the shelter needs to be defended)- Bed(s) (depends on number of survivors. If I have four, I build two beds and wait a while before building the third, fourth comes much later if at all)- Stove --> Improved Stove (usually my Day 2 build)- (Heater if it's already winter)- Improved metal workshop --> Hatchet --> destroy furniture- Improved workshop --> all board ups- Rainwater collector (not built if it's winter, or if winter is coming soon)- Depending on my resources, I will then build one trap and then the advanced workshop, or build the advanced workshop first (usually make the knife around this point too)- Reinforced door- Both traps- Herbal workshop- Moonshine still- Improved herbal workshop- Alcohol distiller- Advanced metal workshop (I might build this before the improved herbal workshop, it really depends on whether I have a broken assault rifle or something and have an immediate need for it)- Second rainwater collector depending on the season- At this point, food and warmth (if relevant) is not an issue so I will build things like armchairs, the guitar etc etc. Then it's just a question of staying alive if dangerous locations are visited, but life in the shelter is otherwise stable and comfortable.

&#x200B;

I always make a note of exactly how many components etc I need to build something and will scavenge that (if possible) before looking at anything else. If the garage is available Night 1, I take 1 bandage or bottle of meds (usually the bandage, it's easier to craft and I use them less overall), and trade it for a hatchet or saw blades (hatchet takes first priority). I don't feed the survivors until Day 3 and then feed them every other day until both traps are built and there's about 4-5 days of food - then they eat every day. If a lot of food has been collected, this is the point where I'll get them up to 'Well Fed', but that often comes a bit later.

&#x200B;

In general, I take a much more cautious and altruistic approach. I never steal or kill innocents, and neither is at all necessary to survive in my experience. My priorities are food, water, and fuel. If I need food, meds/bandages, or trade items, I will jump to a different location and take what I need, before going back to the location I was previously at (that mostly has parts and materials). I really like the Supermarket and Shelled Brewery where you have to save someone, as it's an early morale boost and comparatively safe, plus neither requires a saw blade and wrt to the Supermarket, you get an assault rifle early. I don't mind targeting bandits if I have someone who is proficient in backstabs, but tend to avoid St Mary's if there are bandits because for some reason that damages morale and affects the ending (I don't know if this is a bug or if they're actually classed as civilians??). I say yes to every neighbour request that provides a boost in morale and turn down all that are morally wrong. We have to stick together to survive!"

\- Kova is a small chain of Japanese patisserie cafes that I would recommend to everyone. There's one in Chinatown (which is always worth a visit) and one nearby in St Anne's Court.

\- Come to Camden! Camden Market is great. If you like hot chocolate, go to Chin Chin labs. Camden Market is a good blend of things - food, art, fashion. 

\- You can also go for a walk along the canal. It stretches from Camden to Paddington (and a bit further!)

\- If you decide to go to Peckham (South London), check out Mr Bao. It's so good.

\- London is famous for its theatre scene, and rightly so. The theatres on the West End always have something good going on, then on Southbank there's the National Theatre and the Globe. I also really like the Almeida (Islington).

\- Peggy Porschen is a cute bakery/cafe in Chelsea, but that's in West London and West London transport makes me want to cry lmao.

\- Hampstead Heath and Primrose Hill are always beautiful, no matter what time of year it is. 

\- There's a lovely Chinese teahouse on Camden High Street called Mei Leaf!"

Vindicta,f8tgim5,t3_e2095w,1574802909.0,"This is PURELY anecdotal (in terms of what I've heard from male friends and on social media like Reddit) but Emma Watson is regularly touted as one of the 'most beautiful'. Hottest? No. Sexiest? No. But she's classically beautiful, ladylike, elegant, well-spoken, and intelligent. I think she is not \*obviously\* sexy because she is generally more modest, but there is a more sophisticated sexiness to her, if that makes sense. To put it another way, on looks alone I don't think she would be the first choice for a one night stand, but she would be a first choice for a long term relationship. I personally aspire more to the latter kind of appeal - in which case, being relatively attractive is still important, but being a Giga Stacy isn't really that helpful."

For conditioner, I use Aussie's 'Miracle Moist' 3 minute treatment and use it for the full 3 minutes each time. I usually wash my hair every day or every other day because that's what works for me. I was initially worried that using an intensive moisture treatment so often wouldn't be great for my hair, but it's never looked better and I'm convinced it's thicker, although that might just be a visual effect due to the increased moisture. I also use the OSMO Intensive Deep Repair Mask every week and use the Healing Bird 'Ultra Protein No Wash Ampoule Treatment' at night. That product is much pricier than the other products I use, but I think it's more than worth it. Everything else is budget friendly though!"

What you wrote was that you wanted a man to cheat for you, which is about hurting some random woman you've probably not met. And even if you had, your bizarre desire to encourage a man's infidelity will cloud any rational judgement about who does and doesn't deserve it. Ultimately, of course, it takes two people to cheat; I would not paint the man as a helpless victim in that scenario. Men spare men just for being men all the time, hence I will spare women just for being women, as long as that does not compromise my personal moral code."

Marriage,f3p2xl3,t3_dhiojl,1571040447.0,"If I had a partner who couldn't hold down a job (you're a grown man and yet 'didn't plan' employment when you had a family to support???), abandoned me when we had a young child and then got angry with and resentful of the only support system I had, and refused to work consistently on his mental health issues for the entirety of our marriage (and presumably, the pre-marriage relationship), and is now 'jealous' of the fact I'm the one who's been carrying the entire fucking family on my back for TWELVE YEARS whilst essentially being a single parent and the only breadwinner, and probably taking on the bulk of the domestic chores... I'd have left years ago. I would never have married, let alone have had a child with a man like that, honestly, but there's nothing to be done about that now. She definitely sounds like she's lost respect for you, but I disagree with the other commenters that she's cheating, because you have not mentioned any behaviour that points to anything other than distancing herself emotionally - which makes sense if she has a partner who lets her down and on whom she cannot rely. She should only have to mother your son, not you too. I imagine the reason she's staying is that she feels it is better for your child to have both parents around, but kids can sense resentment and a lack of love in a relationship and it will damage how they view future relationships. If your wife was posting this, I would tell her to leave. It's been 12 years and people rarely change. I suspect that the conversations you have with her are entirely about your emotions and how you feel and how sad and ashamed you are. So she is a mother, a breadwinner, a wife, a cook, a maid, and also your unpaid therapist. What do you bring to the table? What makes you a worthwhile partner? I think it is important for you to have a frank discussion about how the past 12 years have impacted HER and the RELATIONSHIP, not just you. Get yourself into therapy and on medication if that's recommended. I have a chronic mental health issue as well, so I really do empathise with that, but our mental health is our responsibility to sort out. To be blunt, I don't know if this marriage can be saved, because it's going to take a hefty amount of work on both your parts - you have to prove you can be relied on as a financially and emotionally stable partner after 12 years of not being one, and she has to learn to trust and respect you after 12 years of not being able to do that. And you have a kid to raise. Good luck."

basically, the only person you are hurting here is yourself. no one on this sub cares what you think of it or us. we don't care what you think about women or men or their sexual dynamic. and we don't care about you, either. but you should care about yourself. you should recognise that you are an inherently okay human being who deserves to take care of themselves, both inside and out. and you're the only one who can do that. i don't know what your personal journey will involve, but i believe in you. don't be an idiot. look after yourself."

I agree with another commenter that the video was awkward and not a particularly effective way of showcasing the products, but despite everything, she is still very much a child and I'm not going to criticise her as person. It's difficult to say how much personal involvement she's had with the products but for a teenage celebrity, a skincare line aimed at her fanbase is par for the course and I think this is a good thing for her to branch out into.

BPD,f2034bq,t3_db5quw,1569854595.0,"Being a mother is very important to me and I plan to work very, very hard in therapy (and of course in my everyday life) to make sure I am capable of it. Perhaps I am 'lucky' in that I have a relatively mild case of BPD and do not experience the more obviously destructive symptoms. But I have a solid group of friends who know me inside out, and they have told me I would make a good parent. I am maintaining positive things in my life like studying for a degree, and the more 'normal' my life becomes, the more reassured I will be that I can be a nurturing and stable parent. If I do not feel that I am going to be able to provide that, I will not have children. I have also decided not to have children unless I am in a stable relationship (ideally, married). I think it is possible for people with BPD to be good parents, but I do think we have to work harder to get to that point."
BPD,f0ygo5z,t3_d77fsi,1569070093.0,"From your description of her in your post and in your comments, I do not think she would be a suitable parent to any child. You mentioned that she has abused and neglected children who were placed in her care. You may think 'Well, if they were her own children, it would be different' but that isn't the point: her treatment of children is inexcusable and her actions prove that she is not capable of nurturing a child into becoming an emotionally healthy and well-adjusted adult. I really, strongly do not feel that this person should become a parent. It is a sad situation, but the reality is that she is not stable enough to be a parent. Nothing you can say is going to get through to her.

&#x200B;

If raising children is extremely important to you, and you cannot imagine a life without that, then you really have no option but to separate, since there is no compromise to be had. It would be extremely immoral and cruel to bring a child into a household where you *know* they will be abused and neglected. Even if you do not particularly care about having children, she still really, really does, and given the severity of her instability and her desperation to have biological children, it is not out of the realm of possibility that she would sabotage whatever birth control you two use.

&#x200B;

I hate to go for the nuclear option, but I cannot see a way in which this relationship will work out and be a source of mutual support and love for both of you. She, understandably, really wants to be a mother. You, understandably, know that this is a really bad idea. You cannot have half a child. I really do empathise with your wife's situation because I am also a woman with BPD and I would love to have children in the future, but I know I need to go through a lot of therapy and be high-functioning for a long period of time before that becomes a feasible reality. However, having grown up in a severely abusive and neglectful household, I cannot in good conscience consider parenthood to be a good life path for her. But you will not be able to make her see that, no matter what you say, because she is not coming from a place of reason on this issue. I really think it would be beneficial to you to step back and look at the marriage as a whole, and ask yourself how things will look in five, ten, or even twenty years. I don't think I could stay with someone who has a history of abusing and neglecting children."
