I burst into tears, the kind of choking panicky messy tears that leak from everywhere. Some people from the neighbouring houses came out to investigate. The driver of the vehicle I'd dented came to yell at me, but paused when he actually saw the damage. It was an inch deep at most, on a vehicle that had seen much better days. I'd actually done more damage to my scooter.

A couple of the neighbours seemed to understand what had happened and stayed with me till I was okay to drive the rest of the way to work. I was certainly shaken, and I'll never forget it, but it's not the worst accident I've been in. Driving is an inherently risky activity, I think (especially in India, where I live), and my anxiety is bad enough I don't actually drive cars. You've managed that, and I think that's pretty cool!
