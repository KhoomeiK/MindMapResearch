AskReddit,fkctnrs,t3_fhnmo9,1584060894.0,"Reusing my story from another thread because I didn't want to re-write the whole thing:

The apartment building where I grew up definitely had something wrong with it. It had been built in the early 1950's by my great-great uncle, and I lived there from the time I was 7 until I was 25. Over the years I had several major experiences and many minor ones, and there was a general consensus among the long-term residents that bad things were afoot.

My first personal encounter with the entity (because I don't believe in ""ghosts"", but I do believe in demons) was when I was seven. I was sitting on the kitchen floor playing with my Barbies. I just happened to look up and there, on our indoor porch, stood the lower half of a man. I can still remember exactly what ""he"" looked like: lean, with tan pants, shiny brown leather shoes, a tan blazer, and white cuffs with gold buttons and fair-skinned hands. He seemed like he would be tall, but again, no upper half to be sure. He stood as if he were regarding me silently. Then he opened a see-through copy of my front door and walked out, closing it behind him.

The last time I saw him was about 3 months later. I was outside with my mom and grandmother and, again, just happened to look over and see him standing at the corner of the building. His hands were clasped behind his back, and even though he still had no upper half, it looked like he was checking out the area of rot at our foundation. When I told my grandmother about him, she believed it was the ghost of my great-great uncle.

After that, I went years without seeing or hearing anything. Then, in my teens, things got bad. My mom and I would both feel a cat jump onto our beds-- pressure, footsteps, everything-- but my cat wouldn't be there. We'd go out and find him fast asleep on the couch. Then the footsteps began. Heavy, pounding footsteps in the unfinished area of attic over my room. For context, no one could have been walking there. My mom accidentally stepped on that area and put her foot through the ceiling. There was only insulation and ceiling tiles, no floorboards. Anyway, every night for roughly two weeks, this thing would stomp above me for at least an hour. I would get up to make sure the attic was shut, that our neighbors were asleep, that I was not being pranked. As I lay there in bed afterward, I would listen to the steps go in ways that it would take two people to successfully emulate-- from one wall to the opposite wall without crossing over. Starting in one corner and then stopping for a second only to pick up in a completely different corner without any way to have gotten there. As soon as I would wake mom up it would stop, only to resume after she went back to sleep. Finally, one night, I convinced her to come into my room with me. It started up again and I woke her. I could tell she was scared, but she said, ""Maybe it's squirrels?""

As if angered, the entity reacted. My bed shared a wall with our living room, which was decidedly unoccupied. It was as if a huge man had balled his hand into a fist and slammed it as hard as he could against our wall without breaking it three times. My mirror rattled and we felt the shudder of the blows. Mom was up for the rest of the night with the lights on, and it didn't happen again.

The other most overt incident happened around that same time. I had a thick (old style) tv in my bedroom with a little Spongebob plushie sitting on top. I was watching something as I was trying to ignore the footsteps and fall asleep. All of a sudden, I saw with horror that my toy was moving closer to me-- off the edge of the tv set. It fell to the floor and I sprang out of bed. Thinking maybe I'd just put it too close to the edge after all, I turned on my light to check.

Nope. There was a thick trail in the dust where this thing had been slid from the center of the tv top to the front. There was even a perfect roll of dust on the floor next to it. Shaking, I stuffed the plush into a box and went back to bed... but not to sleep.

There were more things. One incredibly scary thing that I don't want to post because it involves someone I know and they might not like that I posted it. However, I think this gives you a general idea of how creepy this place was."

He turned around just as a heavy old man's corpse sat up and groaned. The guy didn't even remember leaving the morgue. He ran so fast that one second he was looking at the dead man, the next he was at the top of the stairs. Never did night shift after that.
2. Different co-worker was supposed to transport an amputated limb from the morgue to the furnace out back, which was at the top of a steep hill that had been covered with snow and a thick layer of ice from freezing rain and sleet the day before. Dad was at the bottom of the hill and, thinking it would be funny, the dude waved the amputated leg at my dad. Then he dropped it, watching in horror as it skidded all the way down the icy hill into a small crowd of visitors-- which included some of the hospital's investors-- who screamed bloody murder and took off in random directions. He was fired, but later considered the story in itself to be worth losing his job."

So, my husband's best friend is a woman and if we had had a traditional wedding she definitely would have been his ""best woman"". She's engaged and he's already agreed to be her best man at her wedding. And you know what? I'm fine with that. They love each other like siblings and I 100% trust them. You're being super insecure and entitled. Him having a ""best woman"" doesn't mean she's more important to him than you, it just means she's important to him-- and that's FINE.

Little advice tip from someone who's been married a while: Having a jealous, possessive attitude like yours is ultimately going to drive your husband away. You need to trust him and not assume that every woman in his life is going to steal him away from you, or that the fact that he cares about another woman as a friend is somehow siphoning his love away from you. Be graceful and accepting and allow him to have his best friend be his best whatever, regardless of what's between their legs."

AskReddit,finn0pc,t3_f8pr0l,1582566301.0,"It was me, alone, in my college building one night. Class had let out about half an hour earlier and I was still waiting for my ride. We had a crazy janitor at the time who was known for being ... well, crazy. He'd recently been reported for harassing female students and, since I was one of his favorite students to harass, he thought I had reported him (I hadn't, yet).

So I was looking out the two full-length windows for the car when I see in the reflection behind me the janitor slowly coming down the stairs. He was staring at me and clearly furious, and the fact that he was being so quiet alerted me to the fact that he was probably trying to take me by surprise. We were alone in the building, or at least too far away from anyone for me to get help.

So I whirled around and cheerfully began to make small-talk with him as though I'd been expecting him to arrive, all the while edging towards the door and praying my ride would hurry up.

The whole time I talked, he just stared at me with wide, unnerving eyes, clenching and un-clenching his fists. He brought up the report of harassment threateningly and I kept redirecting. He also kept looking around, as if to make sure we were alone, and when my ride finally came he backed off. Still, he continued to stare at me as they pulled away.

I'm still not sure what he would have done to me if he'd thought I was driving myself home that night. He later got fired for threatening another student and I was asked to give testimony to a lawyer, so that was interesting. 0/10 would do again."

Look at it from her perspective: she's been growing out her naturally red hair for years now and doesn't want to ruin it for a ONE DAY AFFAIR. I've grown my hair out for years and never dyed it, never will. If someone asked me to over their wedding photos I'd back out because A) my body, my choice and B) a color scheme should never involve a person's natural physical appearance.

mentalhealth,fdjs6na,t3_eld9uc,1578485551.0,"I still love sleep, but when I was 24 I was so depressed that I used to try to sleep all day (if I had no work that day) and all night. It got so bad that I would take antihistamines and sleep aids because I'd have slept enough to have too much energy to fall asleep again on my own. I love my dreams-- often they are like dark fantasy novels. Back then they were so much better than my waking life of being emotionally and verbally abused that I couldn't stand to be out of them for long."
AskReddit,fdgwvw8,t1_fdg3p42,1578410321.0,"I was homeschooled because I was bullied in school and suffered from extreme anxiety, so homeschooling worked for me. As an adult, I've worked in the school system for 10+ years! Just got hired as a full-time teacher this year. 

Homeschooling works when the parent(s) are doing it for the right reasons and are properly equipped to handle the challenges of keeping up with the public education system so their children don't miss out on anything."

Why do I have all these restraining orders?

I do not know, but I will not give up."
