depression,fbmse48,t3_edsmnj,1576988312.0,"This summer, all I could think to do was kill myself. I'd just be this emotional wreck everyday. For weeks I use to think about it all the time. I'd plan what I would do. What I would say on my suicide note. But I could never. Whenever i thought about my friends and family, I'd get sad and guilty. Just imagining them all looking over my body at my funeral made me tear up. So I waited. And eventually It wasn't always kn my mind and I could get threw it. I know that this may not be the best advice. But just wait, and trust me you'll see that you can make it through it.‚ù§üñ§"
depression,f9qw6p1,t3_e67p7c,1575567814.0,Yessss. I know exactly what your talking about. Other people have awful backgrounds that causes their depression. I've grown up in a relatively stable and nice home. Yet I'm still depressed. I have everything yet still nothing. Sometimes it makes me feel bad too. But I just cant get over all this self doubt and depression.

AskReddit,ew3davt,t3_cmcyhl,1565073368.0,I went scuba diving earlier this summer with my family for a reunion. The water was like 5 ft. and the fish were pretty big. Best part was My 2 brothers and I got to swim with fish swimming right next to us. Imagine being in a small school of fish swimming the same direction as you. Like their all around you. I cant describe just how amazing it was and I dont think I'll ever experience anything like it again. In that moment I was accepted as one of their own. God I wish time travel was reall!!!!

I'm going down and next thing ik is my mouth filled with a warm salty liquid. I ran to the bathroom to spit it out and brushed my teeth. And without saying a word I came back and punched him dead in his fucking chest...like hard. He was bruised and started tearing up and I grabbed his shit and kicked him out without batting a eye.
Edit. Also spitting"
depression,etbe9tl,t1_etbdwiq,1562644213.0,I have a lock but it's easy to unlock from the outside. And as for my ps4 we have it in basically our theatre room but I occasionally take it into my room if no one is using it. Like they annoy me alot but after a while they eventually give up. I'm not the kind to just sit in my room and sulk all day. All I want is for them to know that I dont like it and chill. Like if we can all just chill then it wouldnt be a problem. And I have friends that I hang with but its whatever.

Next thing I head was him saying ""raise the dildo a little higher and go faster"" I walked away confused. Then I walk past to use the bathroom which was next in his room... Next thing I heard was him moun then sound of it vibrating in the night stand and falling where they quickly got up and to what I could assume was to turn it off...Then my sister said she was next... Next thing I did was run and played games in my room trying to get the image out of my mind. I have never said anything to this day."
