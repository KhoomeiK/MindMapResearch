LifeProTips,feeodtu,t1_feeflus,1579037844.0,"When my boss tells me to argue with someone sometimes I straight out tell her I won't do it. Most of the time it works. I can handle my boss, but my coworkers, though, they will give me shit and yell even louder at me if I don't listen to them. They even talk down to me. My boss won't do anything about them tho because she doesn't want to lose them. It's pretty fucked up here."
MonsterHunter,feebijo,t3_eoptsz,1579030352.0,"This is a grind heavy game. You'll be fighting the same monster several times in order to craft better gear which will be needed to progress through the main story and hit end game. There are a variety of monsters you will fight so you can mix it up. Sometimes you will fight one and sometimes you will fight more than one in a single mission. There's also 14 different weapon types that you can play around with. Playing with a different weapon changes how you play the game, although since you're a beginner it's best to stick with one right now. Playing online with other people can also change your experience.

If it helps, I play a lot of rpgs and grinding in those games often feels like a chore for me at some point. With MH though I rarely get bored. That's just my opinion, though."

My friends no longer include me. They probably think I like being by myself because I have been isolating myself lately. I'm only isolating myself because I've been really depressed. Then again, it's my fault because I can't be open about it.

I constantly keep thinking that nobody really cares about me. I cry thinking about this because I've never felt so lonely in my life. I just want to go home to my family, but I can't easily do that.

I can't really blame them either because they probably don't know what to say or how to respond. Sometimes they say things I don't want to hear or things that don't help, but I don't say anything out of fear of how they would react.

In World, I decided to give it a chance. It's a lot easier to maneuver with and I got used to the sidestepping. What I absolutely love about it, though, is it's simplicity and the satisfaction of counter guarding attacks. With the addition with the clutch claw and being able to clutch on to a monster after a counter guard is one of the most satisfying things in the game for me :)"

I hung out with her Saturday, but Sunday I pretty much just rejected any offer to go out. When they were in the apartment they were chilling in the living room while I stayed in my room.
