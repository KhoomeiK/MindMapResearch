2. Find professional help. If I have a physical illness I can not expect my loving ones to fix it, but just to support me while I fight the illness. Having a good relationship with your mum, great boyfriend and so on is great for having support but can not guarantee the improvement of your mental health.
3. Job: You can keep doing your old role and postpone the promotion. Maybe you will be better in the future and try again or maybe your anxiety is telling you that you don't need more responsibility. Bigger paycheck and professional success have little to do with well-being and happiness.
4. Don't let these wonderful things that happened in your life make you believe that you shouldn't feel bad. Imagine: I am doing sports, eating super healthy, doing so good at running competitions... and still I can get diagnosed with a physical illness. It wouldn't make sense for me to say ""oh! my physical performance is going so great and look, still I have an illness"". It's two different things."

She was even more attractive than the woman I started dating.

These categories are based just on observation of the symptoms not in any experimental test, therefore they are not exact. In my experience with fellow patients, many of them are classified in one group according to the main symptoms but they can exhibit symptoms of the other for a short period of time. For example, a person with a clear pattern of Bipolar I might have a mixed episode (for example in suicidal ideation) or they can have a few months of cyclothimia and then go back more stable patterns. In your specific question: one person can exhibit traits of BP II for many years and then start experiencing full maniac episodes. This person has been always Bipolar (illness) but we switch the categorization from II to I according to the symptoms. It's not a more accute phase of the illness or a new one."

All of them in moderate levels. If you are a full Narcissist then you also have a role in society but it's riskier.

Jung,eqijohz,t1_eqfa8d3,1560088250.0,"There you have it: your relationship configuration is perfect to make yourself absolutely sure that your partner is not going to be like your father. You couldn't have any relationship because your standard was very high (you needed to find someone that made you 100% sure that you would be safe). BUT with a more advanced moral mindset (that probably you have in some areas of your current relationship like money or politics) you don't need to be sure that you are going to be safe, because you can have an intimate relationship and if at some point you don't feel safe or it's not what you thought you can just break up and this person is not necessarily going to be violent with you or damage you. You consider that a partner has to be reliable and make you feel safe (paternal morality -> what is good comes from the outside). A more advanced morality would be that your partner is just a human capable of hurting you and abandon you and also to collaborate with you and both of you set the conditions for this collaboration (conventional morality). 

My advice is not a book or a reading. Is just an exercise. Whenever you get really angry defending yourself against an accusation, think to what extent the person accusing you is right. For example, I tell you: ""Oh, you are just hypocritical because you would really like bad guys but you are too coward to try a relationship that might hurt you"". If your reaction is ""hahaha what a stupid thing"" then is perfect. But if your reaction is to feel hurt and start explaining me how amazing is your partner and your relationship, then you have found an area of moral development. It doesn't mean that you have to break up and go with the bad guy, it means that you should work in why the hell do you consider that a bad guy is what you need to be happy."
Jung,eqevuv8,t3_by83dp,1560010593.0,"It's difficult to give advice with little information. I understand that you are taking all this with a grain of salt. In my opinion, the violence of your father and the emotional incest might have caused in you moral underdevelopement. It's likely that you might be stuck in a pre-conventional moral (authority comes from the outside, going against the moral is going against the authority). This might manifest in rigid ideas about sexuality, relationships, work... It does not mean that you are conservative, it means that whatever option that you have, you have it because it's the absolute truth and good. You might be monogamous or poligamous, but in either cases is all because it's the right thing to do, not because it's what you feel, a private agreement that might change over time or just your taste. Be careful when you analyze your morality, because obviously all these things that you have to develop are in the shadow. Therefore your natural reaction should be ""who, me? For God's sake, I am ABSOLUTELY ALWAYS flexible and negotiating agreements and for me moral relativism is SACRED"". Well, yes... You are protecting your underdevelopment keeping it in the shadow by making sure (in an authoritarian way) that you do the opposite. That's my suggestion: review your moral development, accept that society has still to teach you what your parents didn't, accept that you had to start using your moral knowledge to support emotionally your parents when it still wasn't developed. And it froze back then. It's not that different to sexual abuse. It's very hard. I hope my words are somehow useful and sorry for my English because I  am not native."
