Hypothyroidism,f27j3gg,t1_f27eu6t,1570039357.0,Thank you! And I had no idea there was an American Thyroid Association.
Hypothyroidism,f27dvy8,t1_f270q7a,1570036036.0,"This gives me confidence and helps ease my mind a little. Especially with regards to current level. I get a little impatient at times with something this important. 
I will most certainly reach out with other questions, thank you! 

What does iodine do for us with thyroid conditions? Someone previous stated I needed to check my iron levels as low iron can affect absorption."
BPD4BPD,f25ucpb,t3_dc19er,1569984046.0,"I did the same for my now over 1 year relationship. He didn’t read them either,  but he’s not a “reader” type. He preferred to learn from me.  We watched a few YouTube videos explaining it together and talked about it after. Instead of reading, he’s been learning and trying as we go. He will ask me to explain and ask what I need. He’s also asked me to stop running away, which we compromised that I wouldn’t leave the house. 

My point, if he truly cares for you, then he will try to learn you and what you need in his own way."
Hypothyroidism,f252j72,t3_dbw2jj,1569964629.0,Thanks!!! I’m hoping to find a few people who’ve gone through or going through the struggles currently. That will be able to related to my experiences.
Hypothyroidism,f24z78l,t1_f24x55m,1569962941.0,"Good to know with regards to NP.  Earlier you mentioned iron might be a cause for lack of absorption. Would taking an iron supplement help, ya think?"
Hypothyroidism,f24t43h,t1_f24sfcl,1569959752.0,"How do you know so much and in such great detail? 

I don’t like coffee, so no worries there. I make sure to take my thyroid medication first thing in the morning and wait an hour before eating or taking any other medications. 

I’m still getting fats, just lower quantities than before. For instance lean meats instead of high fat meats. I do eat a lot of fiber because I don’t have a gall bladder, it helps keep my intestines in control. 

I’m not sure if my doctor knows or not. She’s a NP in family medicine. So prolly not well educated in thyroid conditions. But I start seeing an endocrinologist in November. Who will be more knowledgeable on the issues and becoming pregnant. Or that’s my hope anyways, it’s what the family doc suggested."

No matter what I do or say or get emotional he says he’s not going anywhere. That no matter how much I push him away, he’s not going anywhere.

I’m a reliable, educated, mature and responsible adult yet I feel as though I’m not even an “adult.”  I’m 36 and do not have a career paying job where I’m financially stable as I’m living paycheck to paycheck. I took a new position few months ago which has growth potential but the pay still isn’t there. When I look at other co-workers who’ve taken better paying positions and who don’t have the same qualifications or experience as I do! 
I did all the “right” things and I’m really no better off financially than when I was fresh out of high school. 
That’s just with my career. 

Don’t get me started on owning a home, having my own family or emotional maturity. That’s a whole other conversation."
BPD,eu8bs3g,t3_cf6gc1,1563553948.0,"I’m experiencing this EXACT THING today!! I came on reddit to distract myself or look for guidance I’m not too sure at this point. 
Either way, I try to ignore the really silly upsets that I know are just BPD and overreactions. Every once in a while works. I’m trying radical acceptance but that’s difficult when I argue with myself internally! 
Majority of the time I talk to others I trust for realistic perspective. Then talk to the person who caused the hurt which for me is my SO usually. Because my BPD is all love relationship triggered. 
Current situation I want to talk to him, but don’t know what to say or even what I’m feeling exactly. Then I don’t want him to take it personal. So I’m on the fence. I know my behaviors change when my BPD is trigger so I told him I’m having a bad emotional day. He asked if he can help. Then proceeded to say he’s always in my corner. 

So I don’t know?!!"
BPD,eu1ty47,t3_ce9lse,1563375374.0,"Every person cares and loves differently. They are not always going to be on the same level as you because they are not you. 
I was feeling this same way multiple times in my life until someone asked me once “have you ever tried appreciating what they do instead of what they don’t?” 
Words and thoughts as we know affect our emotions in a much larger way than most. Once I started actively saying and verbally appreciating what my SO does do for me it’s change my emotions. Not entirely, but enough that I don’t become enraged. I also started telling him the most important things I need from him such as physical touch, honest communication and etc. 
I’ll even go as far as to say Babe, right now I’m feeling XYZ will you hold me? Or can I vent? Or I need some downtime. 

I would suggest challenging yourself to see what people ARE doing for you and verbally appreciate. The verbal part was the biggest help to me! As internally I would continue arguing, but once I said an appreciation out loud to them it became truth. 

Hope this helps!"

BPD,erxvodf,t1_erxt46j,1561394571.0,"Wow I couldn’t even imagine the struggles and pain BPD has caused you. Mine came from being born highly sensitive then living in an environment where emotions were invalidated and bad. I don’t fault my parents though as they were doing the best they could. They love me and I love them. 
I’m unfamiliar with this term “split,” so I’m not sure I’ve experienced that. I do have BPD episodes of uncontrollable emotions. I’m not an extreme case of BPD as I don’t have the impulse or self harm factors. Just the emotional dysregulation, lack of self or self worth. 
This was only compounded by being in an emotionally abuse relationship for 7yrs off&on. Where he controlled everything including my feelings and thinking. He isolated me from friends and family. He would tell me my ideas were dumb and my feelings were overreactions or not true. 
I’m not sure if my SO now and I are still in the idealization phase. Does that mean the “honeymoon” phase? Cuz we are not in that anymore."

I can depend on him. My previous relationships were with boys who needed me to take care of them. They only gave me what my BPD self needed which was validate I didn’t deserve better. 

I was diagnosed mid to late last year. I don’t know the exact date but it still feels very recent especially considering they thought it was high generalized anxiety. Then a few months into therapy we talked about my diagnoses being BPD instead but she wasn’t certain what the main was. Therefore we talked and I researched. We both agreed toward mid to late last year that BPD is main and anxiety is just a cause. I just started DBT as of last week."

I hope she comes to terms with it and does come back as you hope. 
I’ve thought about ending it with my SO because he deserves better than me. He deserves stability and happiness. Which right now that’s my shame towards having BPD that I don’t feel I deserve love. Due to being difficult to be with and loved."

Again in his defense, this was after we went to bed and around 10:30 at night. Yet, he doesn’t work til 10am today. 
Are there any videos you suggest?  I didn’t find too many when I started searching a few weeks ago. 

I’ve thought about him coming to a few counseling sessions but then I think about his hectic schedule and wonder what would he gain from it?

I would say it’s about how aware she is with her BPD and behaviors versus the choices she makes. In other words how much control she gives to her BPD. 
Don’t get me wrong, in super hyped BPD moments, I stay away from people bc I cannot Control my behaviors or reactions. My emotions are too high for that.

It’s the best relationship I’ve ever been in and I hope it is my last. Now with all that he has a history of habitual cheating and lying. BIG BIG no-nos for someone who doesn’t trust relationships or themselves!! 
Needless to say I struggle. This week I was triggered by his phone and FB. Nothing horrible on his part. He wasn’t doing anything shady, but it still triggers me. It’s the unknown circumstance that I fear most. Not having the control of knowing. I was withdrawn two nights ago and he was his usual wonderful self by trying to get me to talk. Yet not pushing too much and being supportive. The next day, aka, last night we talked about my feelings and the trigger reason. He was again patient, supportive and didn’t get mad even though I was questioning everything he said. He offered for me to see his phone if I wanted, but I don’t want too as it doesn’t feel right.

I’m very open and honest about my BPD with him, but sometimes I simply don’t know. Or the reason is irrational and I don’t want him to deal with another “BPD moment” as they happen so frequent. A person can only take so much, right? 
What I’m trying to show you is the perspective from a person with BPD. To prove it isn’t personal as it would be with a person without, we think and feel uniquely. As someone said, when we are behaving differently and it’s out of the blue then 90% of the time is our BPD attacking us.  We just want someone to understand the BPD is not who we are, but a condition. We want someone to not take it personally, to fight through it with us and stay.

I have an amazing man now who takes care of me and his kids. He validates and supports in the best way he can. He loves me genuinely even knowing about my BPD and Anxiety. He’s seen some emotional episodes and panic attacks. He has ever reason to run but he doesn’t. Instead he tells me he’s not going anywhere, that he wants to be the man to prove to me love is worth it. 
Even knowing all this I still don’t trust. I don’t trust it’ll last. That he will stay. I don’t know whether I love him truly or not. I don’t know if I belong in his family and etc etc etc.

Does your BF know about your BPD? If not, I highly suggest you guys talk about it. It’s been wonderful for my relationship and my BF of almost a year, tries to understand, listens and offers the best validations he can. 
Having his support and knowing he’s trying makes all the difference for me. I no longer fear him leaving because of my BPD."
