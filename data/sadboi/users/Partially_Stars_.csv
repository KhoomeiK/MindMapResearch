They aren’t a cure-all by any means but they do help me feel stable and reduce anxiety and they are 100% legal. Unfortunately there are tons of options on the market and not all of them work for every person. Even if you find a drug that works, it usually takes about a month to notice change. Have you tried this option before? I also recognize that in the US it’s easier said than done to find a therapist, let alone pay for treatment.

AskHistorians,fm3kof9,t3_fncl75,1585726931.0,"This is a difficult topic because there hasn't been enough time passed to decide a definitive answer. Where one stands on the issue is likely attributed to one's political views. As I'm sure you know, Pinochet solicited the help of economist Milton Friedman and his ""Chicago Boys"" to revamp the Chilean economy. Put at its very simplest, Chile had previously freely elected Salvador Allende, a self-proclaimed Marxist, as president in 1970. Allende's Socialist platform included nationalizing large-scale industries, particularly copper mining. In addition to land reform, nationalization was part of several programs to redistribute wealth and improve the socio-economic conditions of poor Chilean citizens. These policies did provide aid for several societal issues, such as an increase in educational enrollment, increases in state expenditure in health, and decreases in malnutrition. Unfortunately it also created devastating inflation. Put at it's absolute simplest, anti-communist sentiments combined with middle-class dissatisfaction and military action resulted in a coup that installed Pinochet's US-backed military regime in 1973. 

This is the reality that Pinochet, Friedman and the Chicago Boys entered into with their policies. Pinochet (and his international backers) pretty much opposed everything that Marxist Allende had put in place. This is a post about the economy so I won't even get into Operation Condor (but gosh it's exceedingly dark).  Pinochet, wanting to resurrect the economy that had fallen during Allende's Socialist policies asked for the help of renowned Libertarian economic theorists. Milton Friedman and his disciples advocated deregulation, privatization and free market policies. Following these objectives, the Chicago Boys went about implementing economic reforms informed by economic liberalism. These neoliberal policies created what is referred to as ""The Chilean Miracle,"" painting Chile's economic experiment as a resounding success that reinvigorated the economy and undid many of the devastating effects of Allende's Popular Unity coalition. 

Several historians have nonetheless made clear the the Chilean working class is no better off from this Neoliberal ""Experiment.""  ""Victims of the Chilean Miracle"" is an edited volume by many leading scholars that asserts that any attempt at unionization was swiftly and painfully denied after 1973. Even after the restoration of democracy in 1988, historians argue that the Chilean government have not been able to restore the rightful living conditions of the Chilean working class. To me, Chile is a particularly terrifying example of going along with the status quo. Even after the coup, many middle-class Chileans went along with Pinochet because they were not personally disadvantaged by the new regime's policies. 

Does having a great economy for investment supersede having many of your citizens living in poverty? This is the same question that the US faces. Only time will tell if Pinochet's policies were beneficial to the majority of Chileans. Historians tend to argue ""No"" but I'm sure other's will argue the opposite."

AskHistorians,fljdq70,t3_fowhms,1585208193.0,"It's complicated, mainly because most of the writings of the Aztecs were destroyed during the Conquest of Mexico. The best sources we have are documents called Codices (the most famous being the Florentine Codex). These were often written decades after the Conquest and part of a collaboration between native scribes and Spanish friars, thus, we can imagine a fair amount of censorship/myth-making took place with their creation. In some instances, we see the authors hint that they saw the Spaniards as bloodthirsty and greedy, particularly in their obsession with gold. Another popular source for Conquest History is Bernal Diaz's ""The True History of the Conquest of New Spain."" Although Diaz was a conquistador who was present during the Conquest of the Aztecs, his memoirs were also written long after the events took place and should be read with some skepticism. However, he regards the Aztec capital with awe, claiming that few of the Spaniards had seen anything so grand, even back in Europe. So we know that the encounter was not a case of primitive natives vs. superior Europeans. Both sides had unique advantages. 

You may have heard the rumor that Cortes and his comrades were believed to be gods. The Aztecs worshiped a flying feathered serpent god named Quetzalcoatl, that sometimes was described as a white skinned man with a beard. Legend has it that he went East on an expedition, promising to return one day. When the Aztecs saw a powerful, bearded white man (Cortes) riding in from the East on a mythical creature (horses were not native to the Americas), the assumed that it was the return of their long-departed God. 

Historians and anthropologists debate the veracity of this tale. It could be an error in translation, or Spanish chroniclers might have overstated their importance when relaying their welcome into the Aztec Capital. Moctezuma may have just been treating the Spanish with the same respect he would have showed any other powerful diplomats. There is a great podcast called ""Our Fake History"" that explores historical myths. Episodes #9 and #10 ""Did the Aztecs think Cortes was a God?"" It describes the historical arguments in depth in a really informative, yet engaging way.

In a lot of ways, it is a question that you need to answer for yourself by looking through the documents. The book ""Victors and Vanquished"" by Tatiana Seijas and Stuart Schwarts is a good place to start. It combines historical background with translated writings from Spanish and Nahua (Native) points of view. If you read closely, you can pull out clues on how each side felt about the conquest."
AskHistorians,fljbzjh,t3_fp4tj4,1585206169.0,"I agree with the moderator that it's vital to go to grad school to study the area/time YOU are interested in. There's nothing worse than devoting years of your life to a subject that you don't care about. It's hard to predict trends so don't worry too much about what will be in vogue when it comes time to write your thesis/dissertation. 

It's true that you need to read broadly to find your interests but there are some places you can start. Do you want to study the ""Colonizers"" or the ""Colonized""? There is a lot of great scholarship in the thematic realm of empires right now, and studying a metropole usually offers more accessible opportunities for archival research and funding. However, the ""Subaltern"" is also hugely popular right now and it can be very exciting researching understudied places in Africa, South America, and Asia. 

* However, if you are going the Ph.D. route, this is all reliant on finding a PI/Adviser to work with you. Be aware that in order to secure funding and a place in the program you might need to be flexible to the interests of your adviser. For example, I went into grad school wanting to study Cuban-American relations, but my adviser insisted that she would only take me on if I agreed to study the island's domestic policies. You have a little more leeway with the MA because often the school is not providing the financial backing for your studies. 

If you are interested in Latin America, dm me and I can tell you a little more about the discipline and the historiography, I am unfortunately not super well versed in other areas but I can try to direct you to the correct resources."

AskHistorians,f6pnnaw,t3_dsa0g1,1573060334.0,"Put most simply, it wasn't that Haiti was producing so much, it was that Spanish American colonies weren't emphasizing sugar and coffee production at that time. First, to answer your question about crop space, coffee actually thrives in hilly, high-altitude areas, so it makes sense that the fertile, flat land would be used for sugar plantations while the mountainous interior would foster coffee production. 

Second, Spanish mercantilism put a large emphasis on Bullion (gold, silver, and other precious metals). This made expeditions and settlement into the mainland of Central and South America much more appealing than staying on the Caribbean islands where gold and sources of indigenous labor had already dried up. For much of the 17th and 18th centuries, the Spanish Caribbean was regarded as sort of a backwater territory. Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) had been hit by a variety of natural disasters that impeded its sugar production and although it had been an important port during the earliest days of Conquest, Havana's position on the Gulf Stream made it much more useful as a site for trade and colonial administration. The lack of indigenous labor, and Spain's relatively strict policies on importing African slaves meant, for the most part, that the Spanish Caribbean in the 18th century just didn't have the manpower to produce large amounts of cash crops. Really only in the aftermath of the Haitian Revolution did Cuba emerge as a major sugar producer and slaveholder. While Portuguese Brazil was also an early competitor in the Sugar market, its cultivation waned around the end of the 17th century and the colony switched its focus to newly discovered gold mines in the South. 

With comparatively fewer New World colonies to manage (and none with the silver/gold producing capacity of the mainland territories) the French development of Saint-Domingue focused intensely on the cultivation of cash crops. The French government authorized massive imports of slaves, creating the workforce necessary for the labor-intense process of harvesting sugarcane and coffee. Thus economic and political conditions in the New World provided space for French Haiti to dominate the sugar market with relatively little competition from their Spanish and Portuguese neighbors. British Jamaica also had the land and labor available to produce large amounts of sugarcane but the island was engaged in internal (between settlers and maroon communities) and external (with other imperial powers) struggles that likely hampered its production and trade abilities.

I'm more familiar with the history than the historiography but some suggestions for further readings on the interconnectedness of the Colonial Carribbean are Havana and the Atlantic by de la Fuente , Freedoms Mirror by Ada Ferrer, and Modernity Disavowed by Sibylle Fischer"
