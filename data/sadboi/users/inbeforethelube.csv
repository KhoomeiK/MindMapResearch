The real deal is that TicketMaster is allowing companies like StubHub to purchase tickets before the general public, using backdoor API's that allow them to get them faster. Then they turn around and resell them at a higher rate, giving a cut to TicketMaster to ensure they turn a blind eye and allow this.
