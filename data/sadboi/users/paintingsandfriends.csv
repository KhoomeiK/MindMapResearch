If you think you can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to, that is 100 percent ok!!! If this is the case, tell her you care about her and therefor will call emergency services every time she threatens. Then do it. 

Either way, good luck. She sounds really unwell and I don‚Äôt think the dynamics of the situation right now are healthy for you OR for her.

Mirroring back what she says while validating her feelings is the best way: you don‚Äôt apologize and you don‚Äôt argue and you don‚Äôt try to fix anything. For example, you say ‚Äúif I were you, I‚Äôd be angry too‚Äù or ‚ÄúI understand, you‚Äôre extremely upset and feel (misheard, misunderstood, taken advantage of etc)‚Äù 
Note that it is technically true : if you were her, you‚Äôd feel what she feels by definition ...bc you‚Äôd have her same brain chemistry. Also just stating your own boundaries and acting on them is good, for example ‚ÄúI completely understand how upset you are. I have a difficult time thinking when someone yells at me, so I will have to go for a run/leave for an hour/call back tomorrow if there is yelling. When validating feelings, try to use ‚Äúwe statements ‚Äú (aka ‚ÄúI understand the anger, and we will work through this together‚Äù) and when stating boundaries be careful to stay away from all ‚Äúyou‚Äù statements and stick to I statements and just describing what you need and what you will do.

Also, it‚Äôs ok to just not pick up the phone. You don‚Äôt need to react and everyone isn‚Äôt always privy to your time at any moment they feel they want it. Try just not picking up...not as punishment, but just bc it‚Äôs ok to keep a steady keel and only engage with a person when you feel ready and happy and willing to do so"

This hardly points to a lack in character unless there is lots of cheating and lying and need for constant adoration from multiple sources to go along with it.

A situation like this normally would send her dad into complete melt down and probably cause him to freak out yell and then run away from the home.

Instead, he freaked out only a little, I heard him take little breaths to come down, and he said thank you when I offered to clean it with him, and he cleaned it too and even calmly and lovingly cleaned our kid off, gave hugs, and even managed to make a few jokes about it. 

One more week of this sober in control pwbpd left! Loving every moment of it. Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve had over two months of this bliss. I didn‚Äôt even know her dads brain was capable of this.

BPDlovedones,fpjhu18,t1_fpgg4qs,1588669045.0,"It‚Äôs so devastating. I understand. :hug: I had the benefit of the pwbpd having many hospitalizations in psych wards and actual paperwork that diagnosed him borderline pd and also ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù and even then, I had to read the word psychotic over and over again on the paperwork whenever I would spiral and wonder ‚Äúis it me?! Do I really do all these awful things he claims I do?! Is his anger to me justified?‚Äù It took months of therapy and forums to get the CD to go away and to deeply accept the diagnoses and my utter helplessness in the face of it. You cannot love someone better from psychosis or cheer someone up from a personality disorder - I can‚Äôt believe I wasted so many years trying to do that and then feeling angry and resentful and hurt. Now I just don‚Äôt try, and the anger and resentment is mostly at zero. And you know what? The pwbpd is still a pwbpd. He didn‚Äôt get worse and in many ways our interactions are much much better bc he‚Äôs still sometimes him (w the irrational negativity and hurt and anger) but since I don‚Äôt engage like I used to years ago (and I don‚Äôt just mean I don‚Äôt engage with him...I walked on egg shells and stopped engaging w him from the very beginning of course or our relationship wouldn‚Äôt have lasted more than a week...I mean I stopped engaging w it at all inside of me and my own feelings), the overall drama is mostly gone. It‚Äôs just him being him and me being me, happy and productive. That cut down on the overall unhappiness by about half. For example, I used to call my friends crying or talk to my family to vent and I was a mess. Now, if the pwbpd does something wild it rarely affects my mood at all. I still slip up but when I am affected or upset I ask myself what I can do to change it or why I allowed myself to let an ill person so close to me that they affect my moods, and then I try to change the dynamic (go to another apt, limit interactions). When he‚Äôs in his bpd spirals, I try to view him as brain damaged bc that‚Äôs the reality. And I‚Äôm not a psychiatrist in a psych ward so I can‚Äôt do anything to help a brain damaged person. I can only get away from it and hope a higher power or luck works in his favor.

BPDlovedones,fpjgzov,t1_fph0r6g,1588668139.0,"It‚Äôs paradoxical but I found that not feeling guilty about being this way helped. Forgiving myself and seeing my personality as a real super trait helped me kind of even out. It‚Äôs actually really a sweet thing to be always apologetic. In certain situations, it‚Äôs really a beautiful trait because it makes others feel at ease. For example, our personalities are really great for making other equally sensitive people feel comfortable and safe. The problem is that it can also leave us vulnerable to people who knowingly or even unknowingly take advantage of this due to their own poor boundaries. The key for me was realizing I wasn‚Äôt trying to stop feeling sorry all the time for the sake of others - I was going to do it for my own sake. I don‚Äôt need to feel sorry all the time or have knee jerk people please skills anymore. They were defense mechanisms from an extremely abusive childhood and I can grow and learn new assertive ways to exist in the world now that I am an adult and can keep myself safe and give myself the love I didn‚Äôt get as a child. It‚Äôs a real process, that‚Äôs for sure. I think the first step is learning to love the way we always say ‚Äòsorry!‚Äô and realizing it was our way of keeping our inner child safe. Once we appreciate it and feel grateful for it, we can choose to pick up that tactic only when needed and not all the time."
BPDlovedones,fpjgjhe,t1_fphldcs,1588667665.0,This was key for me too. Getting myself to therapy and realizing I was the one who needed to change and have boundaries and healthy self esteem.

BPDlovedones,fpfy2as,t1_fpev4qp,1588587816.0,"Sometimes the pwbpd goes down these self pity holes too and they‚Äôre super manipulative bc they just suck you in and drain you.

If I choose to be here, it‚Äôs for me. Stop taking guilt or responsibility for things that aren‚Äôt yours to take‚Äù

Before therapy, We‚Äôd waste time in these back and forths and I would try to cheer them up by saying how awesome they are and try to build their esteem. Actually, it‚Äôs not my place to do that. Also, the truth is the things the pwbpd in my life felt guilty about were things they Should feel guilty about (and change) but wallowing in guilt and saying things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm awful for you so I‚Äôm better off dead or on the streets homeless so I‚Äôll just run away ‚Äú of course didn‚Äôt help any of that and was just more drama and misery for me. The key was stepping away from that entire spiral. You tell them that you are an adult and take ownership of your choices, and if they want to have a pity fest then they certainly can but you will step away bc it‚Äôs not healthy for you. Then you walk away from that entire conversation bc their happiness is their responsibility just like yours is yours.

BPDlovedones,fpfwhfc,t3_gd4ms9,1588586139.0,"Hi, yes there is. I found a free therapy group for family members of pwbpd that met at a local behavioral clinic. It was very helpful. The key is to realize you are not there to fix or change the pwbpd. You‚Äôre there to take ownership of your own happiness and learn to protect your mental and emotional health. For me, this meant cultivating compassion for myself, learning to have healthy boundaries, learning to stop thinking I can cheer others up or make others happy or affect them at all, and also learning some very practical grey rock tricks for crises times. It helped me change a lot and become stronger and calmer and more centered. I highly suggest joining a group like this. It was life changing for me.

Tips for outrageous comments: grey rock and most importantly truly absorbing that you‚Äôre not in it- (that you just happen to be there). For me, reaching this point meant grieving a bit. You have to truly accept the pwbpd has serious brain chemistry problems and might never get better. You have to really accept that they *are* their actions (as we all are) and then do the hard work to figure out why you would let someone‚Äôs delusional verbal tirades affect your emotional peace or sense of self. For me, it meant realizing I had lots of unhealthy coping mechanisms to try to build the self worth that my abusive childhood stole from me. Mine were just as unhealthy as the ones the pwbpd created, really. It‚Äôs unhealthy and irrational to absorb another persons delusional or erratic anger or blame and I had to really figure out why I did this. It meant relearning my entire way of being in the world. It was tough and also meant grieving the loss of the old me. It changed the way I interact with my family and friends and employers. My life is so much better for it. 

The interactions w the pwbpd in my life improved a lot too actually. Since I stopped being as triggered or feeling personally attacked, it cut down on emotional drama. It takes two people to hurt one another but if one person is spewing out negativity and blame and the other isn‚Äôt affected and takes themselves out for ice cream instead, it really alters that interaction. It‚Äôs the first step. Good luck!!"

In honoring your boundaries, you are trusting them to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions. You make space for them to hold themselves accountable. It‚Äôs a loving thing to do. It‚Äôs not loving to allow an abusive person to abuse you, because it simply enables them and lets their illness or disorder grow.

How dare anyone call you names? You don‚Äôt allow this in your life
How dare anyone hit you? You don‚Äôt allow people to treat you this way. They‚Äôre lucky you didn‚Äôt press charges
How dare anyone insult you? If they dislike you, then it‚Äôs their responsibility to own their happiness and stop spending time with people they find so depressing. It‚Äôs not your problem or job to change yourself for the pleasure of others.


Similarly, it‚Äôs not the pwbpd job to change for you either. If you have healthy boundaries and leave, and this wakes them up to the need for changing, then great! But, really, all you can do is decide what you will accept from people who get to have a place in your life.

- what did you do today? You: Nothing
-how are you? You: Fine
-why are you being such a jerk?  You: I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm tired recently
-I hate you!!! You: Ok. Sorry
-it‚Äôs all your fault and you‚Äôre horrible!! You: You‚Äôre right. Sorry. 

My go to grey rock phrase is ‚Äúok‚Äù bc it can be a response to almost anything. Or even, ‚Äúok. That‚Äôs valid‚Äù even if the accusation is insane and evil (in my head, I just changed it to ‚Äúthat‚Äôs valid...to feel if you are straight insane‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt finish the phrase out loud of course! Really, the key is to keep the phrases technically true. 

And it also helps to practice statements in terms of personal boundaries , for example: ‚ÄúI have a hard time thinking when I hear yelling, so I will leave if I hear yelling again‚Äù. Then, you leave if there is yelling. You, under no circumstance, try to help/criticize/change her. You state your boundaries and what your actions will be and then you act, all very calmly and compassionately. 

The trick is to never react w any emotion at all. Actually, it‚Äôs similar to disciplining a toddler. ‚ÄúIf you hit, I will take the toy‚Äù with no emotion or anger. Similar to parenting a 3 yr old, the moment you‚Äôve become sad hurt angry, you‚Äôve shown your weakness and lost the control.

Actually, the more I reread what you wrote the more I think the insulting part isn‚Äôt the fact he‚Äôs choosing porn over you sometimes, but they way he‚Äôs weirdly negging you or undermining your sense of confidence by telling you that he needs so much sex but then doesn‚Äôt do it with you.

Also, it helps to remind ourselves that their poor communication skills and rudeness and totally inappropriate asshole tone of voice has nothing to do with us. If they want to be the kind of person who treats other likes that, that‚Äôs on them. We can choose to stick around, or not . We can choose whether to engage emotionally or not.

It IS disrespectful to me but why in the world would I stick around a disrespectful person and get hurt by their poor character? It‚Äôs on me to create distance from him if his poor character upsets me. It‚Äôs not on him to magically transform into a person he simply never was: someone diligent and consistent and mentally healthy and happy. He was never that person.

Radical acceptance really helps. This IS their personality. This IS the person you‚Äôve got in your life. Now it‚Äôs up to You to figure out what kind of relationship you want with this kind of person. Maybe a close one sometimes, maybe not- maybe none at all- maybe one with boundaries. 

I think it‚Äôs hard letting the dream die for us...because sometimes my pwbpd can seem so lovely and sweet and you think *maybe they‚Äôre ok!* but then they are a shockingly selfish lazy angry slob for days in full self pity victim mode like the Worst behaved toddler and you get mad at them all over again because you once again had unrealistic expectations. Give this expectations up. The manic lovely sweet kind person is one side of their disorder but so is the petulant victimhood and anger and laziness. (I‚Äôm just speaking for the one I know now.) The lack of feeling Grateful or fulfilled by anything...it‚Äôs hard to be around a person like that for too long. It understandably drives a healthy positive person slowly insane.

They are out of control in their minds and feelings and feel taken advantage of when their fears lead them to melt into another person and that other person ends up being loving and then maybe their fears subside but then they have this loving person and a relationship that makes them feel smothered.

You can take care of yourself, but you are open and appreciative of tips from others for how to care for yourself even better by learning, growing, etc. 

Your ex cannot care for herself. You sensed this and she probably directly told you this too. You weren‚Äôt just giving tips to a healthy whole independent person; you were trying to give basic life lessons to a grown adult.

I am not judging you! I am living with my child‚Äôs dad pwdbpd right now. It‚Äôs extremely hard to work on myself daily to stop myself from falling into this pattern too. Examples: He cannot get up and walk his dog...he sleeps all day for a week and is miserable, he says he‚Äôs bored but doesn‚Äôt complete the many online things he could do for self betterment, does nothing and complains about how awful he feels because he‚Äôs doing nothing while I work extremely hard , he says he‚Äôs unhappy about X and I‚Äôm tempted to point out the many ways Y could fix it or I‚Äôm tempted to outright solve X for him by doing Y myself since I see he cannot. He‚Äôs unwell. He‚Äôs not capable of functioning as an adult.

I have to stay active on forums like this and stay hyper aware to not fall into our previous pattern: I do everything to help a drowning person, but after he gets to shore he calls me controlling and then says he Wants to drown and jumps back in. Then asks to be saved. Rinse repeat.

The important thing to realize is that the pwbpd is really truly Mentally unwell and we are not doctors or psych wards. We cannot fix it. We can only work on our personal boundaries so we don‚Äôt get sucked in. It‚Äôs not healthy to give so much to another person. They aren‚Äôt grateful at the end; they feel smothered and condescended to and controlled. 

I am not judging you. Group therapy in person for loved ones of a bpd person really helped me. It allowed me to see how other kind hearted people also overstepped boundaries and were saving the bpd in their lives from the natural consequences of their actions.

personalfinance,fi4u0tw,t1_fi47mnj,1582148429.0,"This is so true. When my partner and I had an u planned pregnancy his mother called me promising that I would have anything I needed and telling me their family would always support me. 

Haha what they meant was that we were welcome to come visit them sometimes, if we paid our own place and rent nearby, and they‚Äôd share ...I‚Äôm not sure...their presence?

It was a shock to realize this after the child arrived and it took me years to swallow my bitterness. 

However, we did make it work: shifting jobs to part time and from home jobs and being very creative (even living in a small boat with our baby!). 

Now she is almost ready for free public school and things are finally looking up...

I do think I would have made different choices had I understood clearly that ‚Äòwe will help with anything‚Äô didn‚Äôt mean anything at all. I was very naive. 

With my own parent, I asked if they would financially help by paying daycare in case my partner leaves me ...he didn‚Äôt leave me, but since his family didn‚Äôt contribute anything tangible, my own parent stepped up and contributed cold hard cash when needed for daycare. 

Interestingly, my parent was the one who was much more guarded about our enthusiasm of having a child and much more cynical and openly told us we were making a terrible decision : so don‚Äôt always trust the family that gushes about the baby and says how happy they are and how much they‚Äôll help. It might be the grumpy financially responsible person who tells you the straight truth who will also be the person who actually honors their word and ponies up the cash.

Ps I love you, dad :) best grandpa ever"

BPDlovedones,fi3wjn2,t3_f66lu5,1582129152.0,"I think you should read Stop Caretaking the borderline. I think you‚Äôre exhibiting some controlling behavior that likely came from genuinely wanting to save and help her and quite possibly was even explicitly asked for by her. However, ‚ÄúI got her to control her eating‚Äù and all this savior talk about holding her as she cried but finding it to be taxing secretly (it IS taxing so it‚Äôs understandable that you felt that way) is really unhealthy. I think you should step back and question why you did these things but now feel angry because you feel you did too much. (You *did* do too much, but you really need to figure out why). I‚Äôm sure you not are not a bad person and I‚Äôm sure it came from a genuine desire to help her but hopefully that book will help you look at your actions a bit more objectively. It‚Äôs unfair that this happened to you and I‚Äôm sorry. The first step for me was acknowledging that I was to blame for all the ways I gave too much...and all the ways the bpd sufferers stress became my stress. I can only control myself.

BPDlovedones,fhy6d4y,t1_fhy5ibi,1581969520.0,"That‚Äôs fair. The bpd person in my life can swing wildly to black and white thinking which can sometimes show up as horrific trash talking but they always baseline and see their friends accurately again, so maybe it depends on the bpd sufferer. I think, with healthy boundaries and some thick skin and a real understanding that my ex‚Äôs mental illness issues are in no way a reflection of them, a person could be a friend to my ex with bpd for example and find it a beneficial experience. I‚Äôve known my child‚Äôs dad for 5 years and lived with the high and lows of his diagnosed bpd all that time and seen how it affects his friends, so I feel mostly confident in saying I have experience but who the heck knows...I guess i would have to talk to his friends to truly know. I try to keep my life and his social life separate for my own mental health and good boundaries, so I actually don‚Äôt talk to his friends too much.

BPDlovedones,fhy4v86,t1_fhy4jok,1581968622.0,"That‚Äôs totally fair. I do think it‚Äôs ok to avoid certain people if we know we can‚Äôt trust ourselves to have healthy boundaries. I don‚Äôt think anyone has the right to our personal time or our care. I didnt mean to imply that the OP was wrong to block people from their life. They certainly can do anything that makes them feel safe. I do, however, think the eventual goal is to get to a place where we don‚Äôt need to automatically block people from our life due to a diagnoses they have because we feel confident that we can block them at the first sign of any remote indiscretion; this keeps us safe from a myriad of people that can hurt us, bpd or not."

I agree with you. I think that healthy boundaries would by default weed out bpd traits in others and would stop any romantic relationship from developing pretty much immediately if we actually honor the red flags and healthy limits ...and keep our relationships healthy with anyone exhibiting unhealthy traits. It also helps keep the focus on us, a person we can control, rather than on the other unwell or unstable person. Plus, most people don‚Äôt blurt out their diagnoses anyway (though some do)."

If they are really bpd (not npd) then this might work and she might have totally flipped by the time you come back and even see how ridiculous she was being. If she‚Äôs npd then this fight is 100 percent purposeful and the goal is to make you insecure and confused and feel bad. The goal is not to solve any problem or come to a resolution.

With my pwbpd the goal also never seemed to be to actually solve the problem. There was no goal in his situation. He just felt X and nothing rational could sway that feeling anyway, so getting physical space until X changed to YZ was the only solution.

Either way, it‚Äôs not a good way to live."
