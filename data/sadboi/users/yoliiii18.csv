skinsTV,fqja7ik,t3_gizwut,1589407147.0,"I get what people mean by idolizing her by her looks and persona. 
I think it goes much deeper then that. 
Yea she’s thin and the “cool girl” and has no cares. 
But deep down she’s the most emotional character 
She loves the people she hates and she hates the people that love her. 
In the show effy never tried to be like anyone else 
She didn’t wanna be the mean girl 
Or the pretty girl she was just herself and didn’t care. 
She connected to many people probably Bc she was unapologetically herself. She was strong yet so weak. 
She had a lot of mental issues that at the time 
People never really talked about. 
People connected with her pain and sadness."

depression,fiyfs1d,t3_faanb4,1582838558.0,"Dude same I cleaned my whole room and did laundry that I haven’t done in months hoping it would make me feel organized and clean and fresh head space but nothing I even tried showering after for the full affect 
And tbh it made me feel 10x worse Bc that’s when I realized I did all of that for absolutely no reason. 
Just to feel the same if not worse about myself. 
now I’m just depressed with a clean ass room and laundry done. Guess I can’t clean up my depression."
SuicideWatch,fduuu60,t3_eieayu,1578739193.0,I’m such a worthless piece of shit that gets stepped on and dragged like a rag doll Bc that’s how meaningless and fucking waste of space that I am. I don’t what I did. But Ik when I see myself I’m just a pathetic little cunt.
