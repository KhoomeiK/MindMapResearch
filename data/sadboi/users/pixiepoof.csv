I asked her about unemployment and she said she isn't eligible because she was unemployed before covid (due to having just moved to an new area in California and then getting her cancer diagnosis. )

She was doing hospice care up until then . Which you can imagine is taxing. 

Thankfully her Medicare kicked in months before the cancer so at least she didn't go bankrupt from medical bills. 

She is using the last of her life savings to move back to a state where she can live off her social security without being stressed or having to work .

I also ordered my mom who is less than a year post breast cancer and radiation, a roku and managed to set it up from my phone with her reading the code on her TV. 
I gave her all my Hulu and Netflix logins too . 
My mom was a nurse for 50 years and she offered to volunteer but because she's so high risk they won't let her . 
She has been unemployed for her entire cancer treatment and now has to move because she can't afford to stay in California. 

Ups and downs for sure during all of this . Hang on for the ride and focus on all the little good things."

**-Keep a routine.**

\-**Take a  lunch at the same time.**

\-I put on classical music or news for **neutral background noise.**

\- **Take breaks. The CDC says taking a walk outside right now is still an option for exercise**

\-**Watch your posture.** Working on a couch is murder on your back and in no way ergonomic.

\-**Don't fret** about dogs barking or kid noise right now. The world is very understanding for the most part of peoples situations.
