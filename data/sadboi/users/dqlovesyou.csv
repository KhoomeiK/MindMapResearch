selfhelp,fpv0dia,t3_gfkrdu,1588930277.0,"Hey I can actually relate my bf did this a little over 8 months ago. It’s a rollercoaster. I got better for a month and then had a mental breakdown for a month. I didn’t eat or want to stop sleeping then i started overeating and I’ve slowly became more like myself again. I got back into working out and wanting to do things. Not as much as before I think a part of my zest for life died when he did but one day I literally woke up and decided I was sick of feeling so sad and miserable that I too would rather die than have to deal with my feelings and the way people treat me and I decided I don’t want to feel that way anymore. So I’m just not going to. I’m choosing to be happy for meeting him and even if I feel what I tell myself is a crock of bullshit sometimes, I have to keep going. I know people say everything happens for a reason is stupid and I think it’s stupid when I’m mad, but it’s one of my favorites. You didn’t meet them by accident, what did they teach you?"
SuicideBereavement,fohto7a,t3_g7ig7h,1587772437.0,"I relate to you a lot. I’ve felt this way many times after my boyfriend did this. My hearts broken from what happened and I feel for you💗 we just have to keep going and keep trying. Eventually everything will work out how it was supposed to be. We didn’t deserve this, we didn’t but look how strong we are and are becoming. Maybe this was supposed to test our faith? Maybe this was supposed to break us because we keep thinking we can control everything and we can’t and show us we can walk alone and stop being scared of anything. I hate our situation and wish things had been different but one day it will make sense."
BPD,fofz735,t1_fofywa0,1587745380.0,I think you’re right! I mean he got me a journal to help me journal my feelings. And he’s bossy and talks to me like a child sometimes..
BPD,fofymmh,t3_g70ov2,1587745099.0,I agree! I got mad at my guy friend for something he said and suddenly He was “just trying to help me” and I’m “overreacting” very annoying
emotionalabuse,foasde6,t1_fo9jfm8,1587651668.0,Very true I had to work on that as well! That sounds like a good idea too. Thanks! Hope things get better ❤️
emotionalabuse,fo9cnxc,t3_g6ev86,1587615954.0,Ummmm he by far is abusive. If something hurts you it hurts you. And that ass man thing sounds like my ex who was a narcissist. NEVER AGAIN.. you sound a lot like me and believe me he isn’t right for you or mature enough..
SuicideBereavement,fo8k45h,t3_g69x13,1587598114.0,Don’t give up. You’re so strong and I don’t know you but I’ve been through a lot of the same things and I’m here with you. And if it’s all going to shit right now just think you don’t have to be scared of anything anymore you’ve been through it and you never have to do it again but you know you can if you do. Stick with me please let’s get through it together. Message me if you need to talk(:

narcissisticparents,fo0fp0t,t3_g4ww2q,1587412293.0,I used a lockbox for my diary. Buuuut she did go through my closet and find a bunch of alcohol.
SuicideBereavement,fnzh4c2,t3_g4smgh,1587393966.0,"I’m sorry you have to feel that way, it can be tough. The song that my boyfriend listened to every time he was depressed(it used to hurt to listen to)I got a tattoo of and it helps me get through tough times now. Maybe you can come to something like that? My boyfriends suicide note to me hurts to read. He told me in it everything I did that seemed like I didn’t love him like he loved me. Then he told me how much he loved me and had done for me and he wished I could open up to him. Then wrote a giant I LOVE YOU. I stashed it away and wish I could correct his thoughts but I can’t."

emotionalabuse,fnqsqs9,t3_g3c88r,1587171418.0,"Ok first off you’re parenting your parent, my mom did this to me growing up too. She shouldn’t be venting all her problems to you and making you “the dumpster” it is very stressful and if it’s affecting your mental health, you need to worry about you. She needs to fix her own problems and you’re not responsible for that. So you’re basically absorbing all this negative energy and it’s coming out that’s why you’re getting upset. You need to set a boundary for sure. I’m sorry you are going through this.

BPD,fnq654i,t3_g39iel,1587158414.0,"You’re not overreacting. Think about it... who wouldn’t be upset if someone lied? And who wouldn’t be upset if someone was being inconsiderate and not listening? Anyone would! I think you need to start using i statements and be direct with him. Try I feel lied to when you say 5 seconds and your still playing an hour later. ... I feel hurt that you aren’t listening to me... bpd creates a lot of emotional irregulations and you have to learn to communicate if they’re still inconsiderate, you can do better anyway"
abusiveparents,fnpdobq,t1_fnp9k9m,1587143685.0,She asked me if I wanted to go somewhere with her and I said no and then she will compare how I treat her to my dad.
SuicideBereavement,fnnp9yx,t1_fnnkb3i,1587097913.0,"Sucky thing was his mom(most of his issues stemmed from this)was a huge control freak and when I said I want his daughter to have my number she deflected it and said no basically. I totally agree that’s why I wanted to be there for her, just don’t know if I should wait until she’s older or for her to reach out to me through social media when she gets it."
DecidingToBeBetter,fng3ag2,t3_g1hguo,1586921310.0,I’m so proud of you! You can do this. I went through this 7 months ago and it really opened my eyes.
SuicideBereavement,fng2o93,t3_g19cx6,1586920900.0,Aww thanks for your kindness. Just remember this was their choice and you’re very strong as well. They knew you were there for them.
raisedbynarcissists,fng1z03,t1_fng0j3a,1586920443.0,They will be good friends then just turn around and start blaming me for all their problems and become emotional ally abusive. I had one friend say I called her fat and I asked how and she said because I said I needed to lose weight and she was heavier than me! Another friend cut me off because she tried to control who I was dating and I wasn’t having it. I just seem to attract it. Thanks for the tips
SuicideBereavement,fnfdc03,t3_g19cx6,1586905906.0,You’re not alone. My bf broke up with me and kept asking me to come over and I said no and later he was drunk saying he loved me and told me to pick a gun since I started our fight that led to the breakup(over the phone)and I said “Don’t contact me again”. He said “ok you have a good night” and pulled the trigger. I was the last person to talk to him and that will always haunt me. I thought we would get back together that weekend...
raisedbyborderlines,fnbhkh8,t3_g0lesa,1586815656.0,When my mom does this it’s always thrown back up in my face. “I do so much for you” “you never do anything for me” “see what I get for buying you stuff”
narcissisticparents,fn52kjw,t3_fzj16s,1586654415.0,You’re beautiful without hair!
SuicideBereavement,fn3tzfk,t3_fz4e5l,1586627872.0,I feel that way for months and then it gets better again. I can definitely relate. Sometimes The pain really is unbearable but try to remember it’s temporary. They wouldn’t want you to go down that path they would want you to be happy. Try to start setting goals like pushups or anything and try to do them.. listen to music.. journal. I miss my ex bf so much but I don’t want anyone in my life until I can love myself and know I’m not filling a void. You’re strong& you got this.
socialskills,fn0fimo,t3_fyi9tg,1586540996.0,I knew somebody with autism and people actually seemed jealous and that’s why they picked on them. They seemed to be confident and know it all and not pick up when someone was just trying to aggravate them& would joke back. They seemed happy and like life was great... autistic or not people try to take down anybody with these traits. I have a bubbly personality and people bully me often &im not autistic.
raisedbynarcissists,fmwgued,t1_fmwcm2r,1586446340.0,Can I ask what were some things on the list??
SuicideBereavement,fmweifh,t1_fmwa42m,1586445133.0,"Thanks for the advice, I’ve considered it..  (I was diagnosed with adhd and have borderline traits but therapist cant confirm I’m not bipolar) and I saw those similarities (that’s where we really clicked). It may have been combined with aspergers I say he had that because he was repetitive and detail oriented and talked about himself & the same things nonstop. Had the same routines everyday& had to know plans ahead of time. I know I wasn’t perfect either and this has made me want to work on myself for the better so I don’t end up down his path and Guess that’s why it hurts so much. Thought we were in it together but he really let me down... thanks for your kind words!"
SuicideBereavement,fmw6q2u,t3_fxsnht,1586440727.0,Unless you held the gun to her head and pulled the trigger you’re not responsible. She obviously knows nothing about suicide if she things ONE PERSON is responsible. Most suicides have a lot to do with childhood trauma from parents and etc. No matter what you did if she wasn’t already feeling this way before she met you it’s still not your fault. Someone who loves you should never make you feel that way as that guilt and shame you already feel by yourself is enough. That was cruel and judge mental of her. People don’t understand until they go through it themselves. We are all responsible for ourselves.
BPD,fmux66c,t3_fxezqs,1586400882.0,She really was trying to help... she’s trying to tell you you’re not a victim and by knowing why you know what you do it doesn’t change who you are now. My therapist says similar things and I think it’s her way of saying you’re not back there anymore so you can set boundaries and are responsible from here out
BPD,fmuvxy5,t3_fxj04e,1586400086.0,Don’t do it!
SuicideBereavement,fmtzvr7,t3_fwk2dm,1586381989.0,"I’ve been in this exact spot. 7 months for me. It does get better it gets bad, but it gets better. You’re going to know how to be strong now. Stronger than most people, don’t give up."
socialskills,fmtz15t,t3_fxetej,1586381546.0,Everyone does it sometimes one thing funny to you isn’t always going to be to another just accept you’re not perfect and you have good intentions. Apologize and try to give a positive comment; such as the opposite of what you had said depending on what it is.
socialskills,fmtsf0d,t3_fxds8s,1586378196.0,When they tell your secrets or judge you.. betray you. Listen to your problems just to get the scoop then just don’t interact with you at all after.
socialskills,fmtat22,t3_fxbik0,1586369632.0,"Don’t over think it, just do it! If they don’t respond or don’t like you that’s their problem not yours! What’s the worst that could happen? And? Exactly. Just do it if anything it shows who they are and who you are!"
raisedbynarcissists,fmsm33n,t3_fx7nk2,1586358097.0,"I’m in the same position! The best thing to do would be move out but since you can’t I would just try to stay away from her. Take a bath, go outside, stay in your room, walk around with headphones. Nicely set boundaries (try) “I’m studying/taking an exam for the next (insert time) so if you need anything please wait until I’m done. It’s horrible to put up with and I know that myself. You don’t have any grandparents or family you could stay with for a couple days?"
SuicideWatch,fmr3eyk,t3_fhzr9a,1586312966.0,"You’ve been through something very traumatic that no one should have to go through. I stopped my boyfriend from committing suicide and from taking me with him a couple times and he told me the next day it was unacceptable that he did that in front of me. He ended his life a month later. Called me and said he loved me but he hated his life. God is in control. There’s a reason you found her and a reason she’s alive. It was meant to be. I’ve had that guilt too. I’ve attempted and been very depressed and that’s not what that person would want for you. Try to be somebody they can look up to. I would’ve done the same thing... I wish everyday my best friend was here he didn’t know it but he was the only reason i was happy. Life sucks without his smile. Someone thinks It would suck without yours too. If she doesn’t now: one day, in time she’s going to realize you have her a gift. Be aware she could attempt again but many regret it. My biggest regret is that I couldn’t stop him that time so you would have regretted it either way, do not beat yourself up. She put you in that situation and remember, You’re not in control."
Anxiety,fmr1jrk,t3_fvhdns,1586311745.0,The path you’re going down is a dark one if you don’t stop and turn around. Just remember those dark thoughts aren’t true and never give up!! I’ve been through a lot of the same things as you and things get better. Try to be positive. Don’t care so much what others think and be yourself. If anything keep going to prove all those people wrong and  show them how strong you really are.
CPTSD,fmlq351,t3_fvuxyw,1586191143.0,Trigger warning; I dated an alcoholic and I was also an alcoholic I slept on the couch one night when he was in a rage and he came in a threw me off the couch and told me to get in his bed. Then he punched a wall. I was scared for my life I called a friend and she said to leave but I was seriously scared. I forgave this and brushed it off as a drunk incident. It happened again two months later. Another month after that and he held a gun to his head and said let’s do it together. I had to tackle him &he blamed it on the alcohol.. he quit drinking through the week but then he started having anxiety attacks and blaming me on the weekends and would break up with me. I told him next time he ends it I’m leaving and I did. He drank a half gallon and called me saying he loved me and ended his life. I’m just saying too much alcohol isn’t something to mess around with. I loved the guy with all my heart... he just didn’t love himself and he was an amazing person sober. I would address it now. Your gut doesn’t lie.
