But I am trying to take good care of my skin, with both things in mind."
witchcraft,fp3s9ej,t1_fp3regx,1588284872.0,"Well, to be fair, she did come to me instead of me calling to her, but I was very worried it was a bad entity and doubted her presence for a while. 

I did, however, placate the relationship and she seems to be pleased with my efforts. She is probably the goddess I fear the most, which is why I’m so shaken and unsure of everything with her, (which is hilarious since I work with Hades/Pluto and most witches I know fear him) but now that I’ve taken time to research how to make her happy and given her over an hour of my day trying to talk about my fears within our connection, I feel so much better and feel like it’s a relationship that can sustain. I appreciate your help, I will keep this in mind for if I ever have issues later on."

tarot,flvg13z,t3_fr4zng,1585523025.0,"Hi everyone! I’m a very fresh baby witch, been doing a lot of research over the past six months, and today I tried to do a spread to identify if a deity was speaking to me. I’m almost sure that this is Hades talking to me, but I could use some help. The first card, the identification card, is upsidedown death. The second, a negative personality trait, is ace of swords. The third, a positive personality trait, upsidedown Magician. The fourth, their domain, upsidedown judgement, and the fifth, the symbol, upside down hanged man. Please help, I’m so new, and I don’t wanna piss off any deities."
BPD4BPD,ffdml80,t3_esbnh2,1579824090.0,Hi so I’m going numb and can feel myself going numb and I’m didn’t realize how bad it was until about 15 minutes ago because I haven’t interacted socially all day due to weather and having my period so now I’m super numb and I feel like I should try and do something about it or tell someone because in the past couple months me being numb is a precursor to self harm things but at the same time I’m not thinking about self harm things so maybe I’m fine and maybe I should just not worry anybody but also I know people wanna be there for me. Yeah

They have me lay out all of my available panties, thongs, boy shorts, and I get told what day I will wear what pair all week long. It’s kinda fun, a reminder that such a small decision isn’t mine to make, because I’m owned."

bdsm,fbbcfct,t3_ec28n9,1576697553.0,"I have been in a similar situation of a D/S relationship going sour like this, and I can tell you, it takes time to heal from this kind of betrayal of trust. I’m so proud of you for going to therapy, congratulations!! I hope it works out for the best. My advice is to talk to other subs! It really helped me to feel at peace when talking to people who could understand my way of thinking and wants without trying to dom me the whole time. Good luck finding someone who is a good dom!"
BDSMcommunity,fanrmua,t3_ea21o1,1576248943.0,"Sub and Dom drop can lead to crying, so I would say this is normal! I know I tend to get very shaky and weepy after intense play, and aftercare really helps with that. You’re doing a lot with your body and mind when doing D/S play, and it’s important to not only understand your limits physically, but emotionally too. I hope you feel better, and remember to be honest with your partner about these things, so they can help you too."

BPD,fab8dgm,t3_e88n1j,1575919307.0,"I have sensory overload issues with sound especially, but I always think of it as an anxiety/ PTSD side effect as opposed to a BPD issue. It does make my BPD flair though, in that small moments of big sound can cause a 10 in an emotion that I originally didn’t have."
BPD,fab6ufb,t3_e8chmg,1575918642.0,"I struggle with this a lot, actually. I get these big waves of needing to clean up my room of depression mess, of needing to take better care of my car and reach out to others to try and have more fulfilling relationships, of needing to see my therapist and have all my coping mechanisms lined up neat and tidy. And that lasts for a couple days, if I’m lucky a week, and then suddenly. It’s like a truck hits me out of no where of, no one cares how clean my room is, no one cares about how much effort I’m putting in, I don’t care about doing this much, it’s too exhausting and I slip right back into depression mess and only doing the least when it comes to taking care of my mental and physical health. It’s weird, and I’m really glad other people can empathize."

BDSMAdvice,f6wo2n5,t3_dthrbu,1573231002.0,"My favorite punishment is edging, always a big fan of being teased relentlessly with no satisfaction. Edging can be hardcore or tame, so it’s a good middle ground for easing into things."
BDSMAdvice,f6wltn8,t1_f6vh3si,1573229547.0,"I agree with the idea of adding rules, to help you get into the mindsets. My new dom and I have been slowly adding rules and seeing what works for us, but just sinking into the idea. Like my first rule, no cumming at all without permission. Gives more control to the dom and allows for more concentration of control with sexuality. Next rule, picking out my underwear every day. Sometimes I get one or two rules added in one day, sometimes I don’t get a new rule for a week. Just depends on where we are and how we comfortable we are. Hope this might give you inspiration!"
