You have mental illness, as do I, so you have the struggle part down. Maybe you need to add the practice part.

Many wonderful people are born with such challenges you shun, such as Michael J. Fox and the late Carrie Fisher. Of course these examples are/were not in financial straits but its necessary to use examples the majority are familiar with.

getdisciplined,foufpid,t3_g966p1,1588083199.0,"I loved your video and I have a new book on my to-read list. Thank you. 

I'm on r/stoicism. I might get flack from this but I use what I learn from the Stoics as other people might use what they learn from self-help books and other detritus like ""The Secret"". I have a psychiatric disorder and suffer losses constantly. But because I'm guided largely by Stoic wisdom, I try to turn those losses into gains in one shape or another, when I'm no longer symptomatic and I am in the space where I can reflect on what's happened in and to my life. 

My discussion point is on the concept of Black Swan events and the nature of predictability as applied to antifragility. 

With bipolar disorder, I deal with high impact life events often. They are predictable for those of us who are self-aware, but still, only to a certain degree. I've stopped mania in its tracks but I've also not noticed manic symptoms until it's too late and I need hospitalization. Also, the experience of symptoms makes the case more likely that I will experience symptoms again, with a shorter duration of wellness in between episodes. But again, the ability to notice symptoms and episodes before they become completely life-altering varies. So, my major high impact events are somewhere between predictable and unpredictable. 

I'm not sure if psychiatric distress in a diagnosed patient is technically a Black Swan event. Regardless, why is the concept of antifragility applied only to unpredictable events? Can it not be said that predictable high impact events can also lead to self improvement? Take my personal psych example, or, the death of a loved one with a given life expectancy. Is there something about unpredictability that is exceptional? 

Thanks for your thoughts."
