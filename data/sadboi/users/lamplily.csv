I couldnt pack anything before hand or it would of been cause for suspicion. I told them that the home security cameras needed fixing and someone was coming to do it so they will be off and not to worry about me and the house. Obviously it was a lie and I just turned them off so she couldnt see me leaving. The second she left for work I packed everything I could into all the bags in the house. My family arrived and we took as much of my things as we could fit into the cars and my brothers work van.
Mum took me to her place and that night I had the best most relaxed sleep I had had in years. I felt scared but free for the first time. I was emotionally very on edge, but now I'm in a really good place. 

What I want to say is im so proud of you for leaving! It took me many many failed attempts my family and friends were also annoyed at me. But abusive partners make you feel like your worthless and wont be better anywhere but in their grasp.
