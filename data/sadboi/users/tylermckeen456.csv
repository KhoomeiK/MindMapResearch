BingeEatingDisorder,fqahlpv,t3_ghnqyr,1589219209.0,The bloating the next day just...it kills me 😭😭
BingeEatingDisorder,fp6jkyr,t1_fp5bs4p,1588353446.0,"Thank you, I appreciate that. I just don’t know what could’ve caused it. I felt drained, I don’t know why"
BingeEatingDisorder,ercplnf,t3_c0k0dn,1560718511.0,"“Try again in 15 minutes”

Oh how I relate! And for some reason drinking plenty of water really doesn’t help those feelings at all."
BingeEatingDisorder,ercoqyu,t3_c1edup,1560717862.0,And then there’s probably tons of unhealthy food too...oh how I relate! It’s the worst.
BingeEatingDisorder,ercl1eh,t3_c1d64z,1560715018.0,"I had those kinds of emotions at first and I was confused. Now? I’ve dealt with an eating disorder for over a year. Man, it’s hard. I hope you can get through this."
BingeEatingDisorder,er3ctov,t3_c0bgrl,1560460512.0,"So are you. Right now. Literally. If not by certain people, then by me ❤️❤️😊"
EatingDisorders,eqjlxuz,t3_bynnlj,1560107314.0,"Honestly, I feel that your relationship can improve much more, but it’ll never fully, 100% fix.

Think of it this way: before you got an eating disorder, you still had times where you overate a little bit at Thanksgiving, right? You felt some guilt there, but it went away after like a day, and you just left it be.

Similarly to this, you gotta take it one day at a time. Don’t look at “what about 20 years from now”. No no no shhhhh. Just take baby steps. No baby could ever stand up and start walking the earth like that and going for 5 mile runs. No, they started off with moving their arms and legs, crawling, trying to stand up, standing up, trying to walk and maybe falling once or twice, and finally being able to walk. They then picked up skills to run.

Sorry for the weird analogy. My point is that after a while, you start to get accustomed to not throwing up, but you MUST take it one step at a time. I’m still learning this too. I still deal with BED and constant insecurities about myself and my body, but I’m starting off first with loving myself and treating myself right, then when that’s taken care of, then I take care of my binge eating and do things to forget about it. Then, I might try and look for some hobbies to distract me and make me feel good (for me, it’s drawing right now). Then, I might look at my exercising habits and go at a good pace for it. Do you see me doing these things in 1 day? No, I’m going to be doing them one day at a time, starting now because I’ve been slipping a lot!

Stay strong, and try and stay away from that alcohol, since it’s doing nothing for you but making it worse ❤️"
BingeEatingDisorder,eqb0tjc,t1_eqat1oo,1559943247.0,"Exactly! And in that case, it takes a horrible turn on you."
BingeEatingDisorder,eqakp56,t3_bxu7go,1559934827.0,"My god, I’m so sorry to hear. I know it’ll get better for you. Stay strong ❤️❤️❤️

Also I despise family gatherings/parties for this reason. Food. It’s as if they revolve all around unhealthy food nowadays and NOT conversations and fun."
BingeEatingDisorder,epurthb,t1_epumht3,1559514813.0,I was just making sure bro
BingeEatingDisorder,epue3ya,t1_epu4g9t,1559508262.0,"You might wanna edit that last sentence.

Other than that yeah I agree"
BingeEatingDisorder,epub9mg,t1_epuayn5,1559506933.0,"I felt the same way, and I feel like I’ll start to feel that way sometime in the future, but you just gotta try and look for the good in yourself. Please, don’t give up. Focus on yourself and give yourself things you love, distract yourself and go on walks/runs if you can (I need to follow that advice more). Try and get help and vent to those you trust most (I know you don’t trust me but I can talk to you in PM if you need me to).

You got this ❤️❤️❤️"
BingeEatingDisorder,eptq8iu,t1_eptq6o0,1559495401.0,Always bro ❤️
BingeEatingDisorder,eptopi7,t3_bvz7jj,1559494535.0,"You’ll get there don’t worry. Try and get your mind off of it and try and look at the importance in yourself! You can do it.
Anyways, to answer your question, yes I feel that way a lot, but then it all hits me in the morning. It’s the worst feeling ever. Feeling so bloated and then you try and force yourself to exercise it off but you can’t.
Please get well soon ❤️❤️"
BingeEatingDisorder,ep2mc6l,t1_ep2l3qa,1559010121.0,"Exactly. It’s so hard. My mom really doesn’t get it, nor does she ever read ingredients lists ever. Her eating patterns and the amount of sugary and unhealthy foods she keeps around the house influence me a lot. She will literally eat half or a whole bag of chips/cheezits, in one sitting. It’s crazy.

She says that the unhealthy food in the house is for everyone else. Absolutely hate having to watch my family eat unhealthy food.

My mom has also said that she needs to lose weight, and then she says the same thing about my older brother and little brother, yet makes zero changes to the unhealthy foods seen in the house and makes zero efforts into trying something new. I don’t think she gets how much it can influence you."
BingeEatingDisorder,ep2i9wf,t3_btu74i,1559008681.0,"Honestly, I’m open about it to friends close to me, but not really with family. I feel like my family doesn’t understand the severity of the situation, not to mention that my mom still buys so much unhealthy food too."
BingeEatingDisorder,ep0p454,t1_ep0p184,1558978430.0,"It really is bro. I hope you get to where you want to be, and I’ll be here for you."
BingeEatingDisorder,ep0jemq,t3_btnoan,1558976233.0,"I know what it’s like man. I’m only 17 and I’ve been dealing with this for over a year. And it happened after I lost weight too. I can’t even find a balance and I don’t even feel much enjoyment anymore. Feels like my whole life is going to be like this and I hate it. I hate it so much. I’ve never felt more weak in my life, and more ashamed. It’s as if it’s going to haunt me forever."
BingeEatingDisorder,eot0huu,t1_eoqhlx4,1558832864.0,"I feel like when it starts to interfere with school/work and how you feel at school/work, then that’s when it becomes a major issue. Binge eating has really interferes with how I feel at school. Whenever it happens, I just feel like farting up a storm, while also feeling so bloated. It’s the worst feeling ever in a public setting."
BingeEatingDisorder,eosy7r0,t3_bsz322,1558831588.0,"Well, I’m a little upset because I binged a little yesterday and a lot today, but other than that, I stopped binge eating for 5 days straight. God, did it feel so good!!! To not have to feel bloated and miserable at school. To feel happy with myself.

I guess I let myself get a bit too comfortable. I have been doing better with eating in general (chewing 20-40 times and drinking water in between), but still.

I was also able to distract myself by doing drawing today, so I was able to get myself back into a hobby that I stopped doing before.

I hope I can just get to where I want to be. As much as it seems like I’m doing well and I’m less insecure, I’m still insecure about myself, though it’s been lessening, it’s still there, and I’m still scared, which is again lessening, but it’s still there."
