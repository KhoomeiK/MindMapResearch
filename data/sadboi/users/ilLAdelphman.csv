panicdisorder,fmsxfpe,t1_fmqjn7d,1586363509.0,It’s not silly at all. I’ve been doing that for well over a week now. I took my temp 3 times yesterday. It helps to see that I don’t have a temp.
Anxiety,fma48l0,t1_fma10j1,1585883427.0,"I work in accounting and I have to go our office once a week that doesn’t help. I’m even starting not even want to hang with even one person at a time. It’s literally on my mind almost all day it seems. 

And that’s sooo terrible to hear that your governor hasn’t done that yet. I’m so sorry that hasn’t happen yet. It should have happen weeks ago. We’ve been at our houses for a couple of weeks now. And we’ve just been told we have to wear mask when we go out."
Anxiety,fma0sct,t1_flftiej,1585881028.0,I was the same way. I was all calm cool and rational but now that we don’t have control or any power to cure this or even test to tell us if we have it just puts me over the edge. And watching the news all day doesn’t help me either.
Anxiety,fma0lyx,t1_flhcre5,1585880905.0,Sooo true. Well said.
Anxiety,fma0g97,t1_fldnsc0,1585880794.0,I’m going through the exact same thing. Everything you describe I have the same things. The shortness of breathes and the yawing like I’m gasping for air is killing me. Literally doing it constantly. Makes me think I have this virus.  It got me soo bad on Monday I went to urgent care and the doctor listen my heart and lungs and was like your good and healthy and that still didn’t relax me at all. I’m like still could have it. I’m trying so hard to relax and tell myself your good you have no symptoms but it doesn’t quite work. Glad to to know I’m not the only one. We’re in this together.
panicdisorder,fm9yhkb,t1_flrc5h0,1585879456.0,Same here!! Chest heavy and a lot of deep breathes. It sucks.
panicdisorder,fm9vqcq,t1_flyxuqr,1585877653.0,I’m doing the exact same thing. I sometimes taking my temperature 3 times a day.

panicdisorder,fm9vj7e,t1_flyxs7p,1585877527.0,Same here. I’m on a constant state of panic. Any little that happens to me I think I have the virus.
worldnews,fm7uw0z,t1_fm7t37u,1585837266.0,Good that’s one less person to take the vaccine if they want to think like that. More for us.

Thank you
PanicAttack,fm6d0hm,t1_flfd4ki,1585791356.0,Thank you for posting this. I’m literally going through the same thing. I’ve been in a constant state a panic now for like a week almost and I’m still trying to relax myself. I had a such a bad attack on Monday I had to call my old physiatrist who I have not spoken to in 14 years. Telling I think I’m having an panic attack and then he just proscribe me something. I even went to urgent care on Monday cause I sooo scared thinking I had this virus and the doctor listen to heart and lungs and was like your good your healthy and it still didn’t settle me down.
politics,fm56li3,t1_fm4uz3b,1585767275.0,All have drank the kool-laid. Sad to see. Middle of America will be saying different things in a week when it’s hitting them like New York. I feel bad for them all and pray for them
DistinctAthlete,fm4up8v,t3_ft28ne,1585761154.0,Do we think this is actually legit?! I don’t want to get all happy about it and then it isn’t what it seems. Let know what you guys think? Cause I’m thinking it is.
PanicAttack,fm4alp8,t1_fm1tkod,1585750278.0,I’m going through the same thing. Literally can’t stop thinking it about it or stop watching the news. I’ve been trying to not watch it and just watch other things and do other things but even when I’m doing other things I still feel anxious and my panic will come and go. I’m really trying to tell myself I’m good and there’s nothing wrong. But still can’t put myself at ease.
PanicAttack,fm4a8tu,t3_fseoa3,1585750062.0,Yes!!! And I just can’t get my mind and body to relax now. It’s like I’ve crossed over this line and I’m just in a complete state of panic it’s like all day for me right. It’s a roller coaster for me
PanicAttack,fm30tot,t1_fkp1ejl,1585710022.0,I am literally going thru the same thing. I even went to urgent care yesterday and the doctor was like your fine. And I’m still not relax. Still in a panic I feel like.
PanicAttack,fm2ztyv,t3_fjkff1,1585709338.0,"Yes!!!!!!!! OMG!!

Man soo happy I saw this post cause I think the last 2 days probably even since last Friday I’ve been having panic attacks or anxiety  attacks. Like I’m constantly taking deep breathes and and it takes me like 2 or 3 to actually like I completed it. And I was really going through it yesterday even went to urgent care thinking maybe I have this corona virus but the doctor check my lungs and heart said was good and healthy and it was stress. It still didn’t put me at ease. I started liking up what I was feeling and came to panic attacks and anxiety attacks. Still going through it and just got prescribe medication for it so hopefully he me relax."
