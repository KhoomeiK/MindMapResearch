Honestly, I went through a stressful period and lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks :/ I didn't even try, just every food made me sick, I had zero appetite and stomach ache. I didn't want to be lean, I wanted to enjoy food and life again...But my mind was making me sick. That is how I lost the last 10 pounds..

 What I mean to say is, don't be miserable or sad because you don't fit some arbitrary body standarts. If you are happy and feel good, if you are satisfied with who you are and have people to share your life and joy with, then you are beautiful. Believe it and move on. Being lean, ripped, toned, etc. generally means nothings. When you look back at your old pictures you will remember that you were happy and finally see the beauty that you were, but didn't believe :)

That happens all the time, it's just our way to learn new things and to accumulate new information. It is also beneficial for creative discovery, because it allows you to mix different things and maybe have those eureka moments.

For example thinking about the law of gravity, while an apple falls on your head. You are present in the moment, watching the apple fall, but subconsciousy your mind is actually processing a mathematical formula.

Neuropsychology,fkqpq6s,t3_fd5wbj,1584452658.0,"Uhmm guys... psychopathy is a complicated personality and social disorder that is not simply related to aggression.
Aggression can be hot or cold - reactive or instrumental. Now from the classical hollywood family of narcisstic psychopaths we all intuitively know that narcissim is related to instrumental agression. That is the cold, calculative, psychopath type that can execute his plan with detailed precision and will have the patience to do it. Not a hot fuse that will get caught in the first act. They are very different types of aggression, caused by different brain dysfunctions and social/ environmental factors.

The amygdala has different parts. One is responsible for perceiving fear, another for expressing fear. I am sure a psychopath doesn't strike you as the most fearful individual? After all he is able to execute his plan with such daring and cold precission. And in fact his fear expressing amygdala is much smaller and less active than in normal people. Their fear perceiving amygdala can be normal or more active than in normals. Psychopaths actually produce less stress hormones. If you have anxiety (more stress hormones), don't despair! It is unlikely that you will ever be a psychopath :) So yes, their life is in the greyish hue and they need that extra thrill. 

An important connection is from the amygdala to the medial and orbital pfc. In psychopaths this link is broken. The medial and orbiyal pfc is important for decision making, for interpreting the actions of yourself and others, for making moral judgements, for empathy and for guiding social behaviour through the so called ""somatic markers"" or body signals. If we didn't have the link between the amygdala and mpfc we would be handicapped in normal social behaviour, we wouldn't recognize the signals (emotional and bodily) that we use to guide our decissions. 

If we look at narcissism there is another dysfuctional connection. Actually we don't see an exaggerated sense of self, but just the opposite - a feeble and dissatisfied view of the self. Again the mpfc is involved, because it is responsible for forming a representation of the self and is activated when people envision themselves in the future. When we are satisfied with ourselves the mpfc sends strong projections to the ventral striatum - our reward center, and that connection is diminished in narcissism.

So, the mpfc is implicated in both disorders and it is evident that there is a dysruption of normal function.
What the psychopath achieves through his diabolic act is a conquering of another human being, a complete expression of the will for power and control. An orgasmic satisfaction of his desire for self-affirmation. A desire that the psychopath canot achieve through other means, as he is handicapped from feeling satisfaction of himself, and he cannot hope to acheive any recognition and satisfaction from others other than by violence. 
End.

What I am interested in is weather certain brain areas are actually hyperfunctioning (excluding the amygdala) and more developed in narcissism and psyhopathy.... any ideas?"
Neuropsychology,fkqilxv,t1_fkellnf,1584447073.0,"Aberrant salience doesn't really mean much. There can be aberrant salience in many conditions - in anxiety, autism, ocd... etc. The salience network is composed of several different nodes - acc, insula, amygdala and isn't guided by a single neurotransmitter system. I think during an LSD high the abberant salience you experience is a consequence of your altered perception and state that will cause the salience network to activate differently. Same with schizophrenia. The aberrant salience theory originated from the assumption that d2 overexpression was in the ventral striatum - that codes reward. But it is now known that the disfunction is in the associative striatum."
Neuropsychology,fkqhp57,t3_fh0h38,1584446203.0,"I think this isn't anything new, as it is well known that aggression towards others reduces stress.
And anything that lowers stress will tend to be reinforcing. The reason that we don't see aggression being deployed all the time in animal and human communities is because it is counterbalanced by fear (of others) and empathy (for close ones). But in many other cases aggression is an effective (if not ideal) way to reduce stress, fear and even pain."
Neuropsychology,fkqfyct,t3_fjsn13,1584444413.0,"I think the effect you are desribing is more properly defined as priming. This is the information you are looking for-

Priming is extremelly usefull for learning new skills and going about your daily work. It is an extension of working memory and as such relies on the activity, not the hypoactivity, of the PFC. 

Perserveration is a completely different process, that impairs daily functioning. It is an inability to inhibit a persisting response even if its no longer usefull and beneficial. It is also described as an impariment in task switching and set shifting in various contexts - emotional, social, cognitive. 

What you are describing is a completely normal effect of exposure to a stimulus. The networks that have been used during a challenging or novel task become hot and are more likely to fire especially in the presence of similar cues.

neuroscience,fkqdbsf,t3_fizhzy,1584441383.0,"The human brain is already being reshaped by evolution and civilization.

In a few centuries there probably won't be a person alive that knows how to type : D  all types of physical labour show a decline and craftmanship is just an artifact of the past. Its a pity since our brains were evolved to use tools, but maybe these brain areas will start to decrease. 

I hope humans will at some point evolve a more altruistic stance, a true cooperative nature and an objective moral   view.

neuroscience,fkqc8od,t3_fjoadr,1584440010.0,"Yes, but its not the only way visual hallucinations are caused.
Sensory areas can be activated top-down either due to a hallucinogenic drug (acting through serotonin) or due to a mental illness like schizophrenia. The content of the hallucination will be determined by the level of activation along the visual hierarchy. Lines and geometrical patterns, produced by LSD, are caused by activations in primary visual areas. Complex objects and scenes - by higher association areas. They are also specific and fall within distinct categories - grotesque faces, figures, scenes or motion distortions and are activated by discrete areas in visual corex. I encourage you to read Oliver Sacks, who is not only the most brilliant author and clinical psychiatrist, but also extensively studied hallucinations and their causes. One of the disorders he describes in the older population is Charles Bonnet syndrome. Patients experience vivid and recurring hallucinations, but not accompanied by psychosis. In CBS they are produced by the destruction of peripheral input from the retina or optic tract. The loss of visual perception causes a disinhibition of visual areas. Visual deprivation hallucinations also work through the same mechanism. The third type of hallucination is caused by lesions of the brainstem and work through the reticular activation system. They are common in people with sleep disorders.
Hallucinations work by way of two neurotransmitters - serotonin and acetylcholine. Serotonin agonists like psychedelic substances have been know for milleniums for their hallucinogenic properties. Acetylcholine can induce hallucinations in AD patients and also in REM sleep. It is the primary neurotransmitter responisble for dreams. :)
I hope this helps, there is a lot of things to learn about hallucinations, these are just some ideas where you can look :)"

Have you heard of treatment resistant depression? Some estimates are a whooping 50% of depression cases. That's tough. In those cases novel treatments such as Ketamine therapy or Deep Brain Stimulation can be helpfull. Both methods block abnormal activity in the brain. Ketamine blocks glutamate NMDA receptors and DBS inhibits activity in the subgenual region - implicated in the experience of sadness, that becomes overactive in depression.
Norepinephrine doesn't treat depression, serotonin does. SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) only work because they work on serotonin. Norepinephrine balances out some of the side  effects of SSRIs, but it cannot treat depression alone.
When you start taking antidepressants what changes is the way you experience and perceive things. Bad things still happen, but you are able to see them in a new light and make changes. You can begin to re-evaluate your emotions and thoughts, the so called ""thought pattern"" can be rearranged :) It will not rearrange on its own, tho. Antidepressants can show you that there is life and hope above the abyss, but only you can make the step and where it takes you, depends entirely on you.

Neuropsychology,fkcqdqh,t3_ffr1gj,1584058758.0,I am not sure that Schizophrenia is caused by aberrant salience.

Ventral striatum responds to rewards and salient stimuli.
neuroscience,fkcq1sl,t3_ffvg6b,1584058543.0,"Hey, great question :) I believe its not an all-in or all-out type of process. The patterns of activation and deactivations vary considerably between different people and different disorders. Some people deactivate the DMN more strongly during tasks, others not so - Schizophrenia, Depression, also creative people. You can see how the processes responsible for introspection, memory and emotion can become manifest in these people and interfere in their executive fuctioning - 
""Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything"" (Plato). Also, any type of creative endeavor - weather in art or science disengages activity of the DLPFC (key node of CEN). 
 
And then there is the Salience Network. I wonder how no one mentioned this? The Salience Network is the third major resting-state network, that acts as an intermediate and a switch between the two. It consists of the Anterior Insula and the Anterior Cingulate Cortex. Again differences in this network activation are seen in pathology. Autism and Anxiety disorders show hightened activity and abnormal disengagement of this network.
In Autism the nodes of different networks are also weakely defined and there are global network abnormalities throughout the brain.
It is a fascinating subject, but its not a simple on-off pattern. There are degrees of activations and deactivations in RSN and abnormalities can arise when the nodes aren't functioning right.

Adderall and Vyvanse are amphetamines, while Ritalin is not.

Make sure you are not overmedicating and use just the amount you need to do your work. At the other times just enjoy the fun and carefree life that ADHD brings.  :)

Another thing that might be relevant: your skin concerns maybe due to weightloss. Weightloss + waterloss = dry skin + more visible wrinkles. Also it is still the winter season and the cold months are the worst time for dry skin. Apply mosturizers without scent or alchohol and maybe some coconut oil.

Drugs,fis098f,t1_firzjzk,1582674836.0,Thanks a lot! What about the effects on the body? Are there any benefits at low and intermittent doses? Like the body's ability to handle and adapt to stress perhaps? Anyone aware of the biological mechanisms there?

depression,figk6zl,t1_fighhhc,1582400545.0,"Thanks :) I also thought I had ADHD... sometimes they go together, which is a bitch. I still don't know what is wrong with me, but I am pretty depressed which brought me here. I guess you just have to keep on trying to figure it out, try the meds at some point, or fuck off society and go on with your life :)"
TrueOffMyChest,figd5h8,t3_f2frcu,1582398272.0,"I guess we will evolve to deal with the dehumanization and life in some artificial silicon world... perhaps genes will be selected that shield us of our emotions and make us cool and calculative... after all those are the most successfull people in the world. Or we will continue to stack drugs even more than now and be in a permanently altered brain state... we need nature & human contact, our brains are made to recognize & respond to those things, but they have become a somewhat luxury :/ an actual study proved that the brain area hyperactive in depression becomes less active after nature experience... so yeah, I seriously look forward to get the ff out of this urban bullsh.t"
depression,fig6rlc,t1_fig1xqv,1582396678.0,Thanks  ;-)
depression,fig6i1a,t1_fig1rlp,1582396591.0,"Haha, thats really sweet :) you know I always get really comfortable with strangers.. weather its chatting or meeting them in another country. Its just sometimes you bump into all kinds of people, weird ones, fun one & some just like you. The world is a big place... my biggest problem is living in shitsville Eastern Europe.. among torn up soviet blocks and ignorant mongrels.. so I mostly hang out with my cat. But its really become depressing now. I really want to leave this place.. but it feels like im in a black box. Point is... travel if you can, go on an adventure, even if its pointless."
depression,fig39h2,t1_fifo7jo,1582395646.0,"I am really sorry :( when you express love you are always vulnerable it seems.. i hope there are people to cherish us for what we are, not what they want us to be. Also....Fuck Paula!!!!"
depression,fig0bzk,t1_fifz9sm,1582394924.0,Yeah.. I am just so anxious to try it and so ff scared it will not work :/  and damn dont you have a cat to take care of the scratching? (sorry) :-)
Nootropics,fifzdfw,t1_fifxv3n,1582394644.0,Never rried ani... Does it work differently or is it just way stronger than piracetam?
depression,fifyt7a,t1_fifk6py,1582394471.0,Yeah thats the short term memory being hijacked ... perhaps depression wants to protect you from all the awful experiences you may get and just sheds your memory away... I just ordered some nootropic thats supposed to help. Will update
depression,fifh189,t1_fifehb5,1582389725.0,No shit? Your age?  Depression is killing our brain cells goddamit.....hopefully the memory center thats been hijacked by this b.tch can grow new cells! I am hoping on that

depression,fif9x5j,t1_fie7cx0,1582387475.0,"Hey, I am Alex too btw =) I know that feeling
I just get super high hopes for people and then feel like they totally didnt deliver. Or I get attached and clingy, then hurt, then broken... so I prefer to be isolated
I feel depressed people become a bit childish in their emotions, me at least. Like all the suffering, pain and obsessive thoughts made us regress to some older level, like when we were children. Do you feel that?"
depression,fif7beg,t3_f7mjbx,1582386429.0,"Hey... I am feeling really isolated right now, thinking what will that escale into... isolaion is really the worse, its really the most f.cking realistic 5D lie there is on earth. Cuz when you consider it.. you are never alone. You are part of this big, giant thing called life, which is still in its infancy. Its still just being created and who knows what that will evolve into. Multicellular life evolved from cell colonies, just multiple cells literally stuck together. They could work together like a single unit but they could also break apart at any time. We also break loose sometimes... but we are also part of this building, this bridge or tower or temple... and it may all fall into pieces, we just don't know..

My point is that life is everywhere, it is given to us all, it is what we are. And no job, people, institution, or anyone's belief or ideas should take it away from you! When you find people who support you, life will get better. I believe it and I hope it happens to you!"
depression,fif0118,t1_fhaeayx,1582384282.0,"Thats exactly how I feel..... :( it's kinda comforting to hear you experience it the same :)) I keep getting advices that make me feel even more like I am judged, unwanted and isolated :( depression just messes with your mind... it makes all the doubts, uncertainties and little struggles of life seem so real, huge and unsurmountable. People just don't understand, only depressed folks do ;) :)"
depression,fiewscv,t3_f1yg2s,1582383414.0,"The worst thing is when everyone backs aways from you. Like you got the plague, only it isn't showing.. They keep giving you advice, what to do, what you shouldn't do, what is wrong with you, what you need to fix, they keep judging you... when you are happy and careless, thats when they want you. 
I really didn't want anything. I didn't want help, I didn't want compassion, I didn't want to feel special... all I wanted was some assurance, some comfort that someone would be there no matter what... But they all left. When I wasn't smiling, laughing or joking, they just left :( I just spend the last hour crying in the shower and thinking of all the people that took their lives, while they were in living HELL, possibly I couldn't even imagine, screaming and falling into pieces inside and even their closest ones didn't notice :( Love people, show compassion, don't judge..."

My emotions go through the roof and make a full 360. Then Id feel so damn exhausted, burned and repulsed, but then id do it again :("
Nootropics,fibiwg0,t3_f7hd3c,1582322920.0,"Hey. I just ordered 1/2 gram of this unregulated sh.t 
I am really interested to test it for its memory enhancing properties. Sounds like it eventually reached a plateau for you. Perhaps the drug lossing its potency triggered the anxiety and general unwellness. 
The whole mystical aura around Prl is kind of suspicious, though. But I owe it to the whole economical, political and extraterrestrial influences that go into drug manufacturing."
Nootropics,fib7xlf,t3_f7a712,1582316442.0,"Piracetam specifically made my ADHD worse if not stacked with some stims. I think it doesn't improve concentration specifically. But..made me super talkative once, felt like I was giving a speech for the UN on the phone at 3am :D"
