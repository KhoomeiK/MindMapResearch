death,fqta901,t3_gkt83g,1589634450.0,"My grandmother died from Covid on April 12th. She was the best person ever and I miss her every single day. 

There was a lot of wondering at the beginning. What if we had taken her out of her retirement home? (Which we thought was safe because it was in a nearby town that had been unaffected by Covid) What if she had got a ventilator? What if the staff of the nursing home had been more careful? 

I get it, but in the end, the truth is that everyone did the best they could given the situation. 20 out of the 40 residents of her retirement home have passed to Covid. Nobody wanted that. The workers tried to be careful. People at the hospital tried to do what they could, nobody denies treatment they can give! (At least not in countries with universal healthcare) and we tried to make the decision that we thought would keep her safer.

My point being... This is a shitty situation. It's unfair. It's not your standard death... Let the wondering period happen and let go then. In my experience this is a whole different kind of grieving from any that I had experienced before.

Feel free to get in touch!"

AmItheAsshole,fqnk1iz,t1_fqndusq,1589496248.0,"There's information all over the place in the post so you may have lost this. 

The origin of our argument was after she had an argument with a friend of ours, which was when she told the other woman to die. Both said things and long story short, the other woman was unforgivable but my friend's wife was not.

Friend and I were talking about this, and I told him it's a bit unfair that our friend is so unforgivable when your wife told her to die and that apparently is okay. 

To this he answered ""but she's autistic"". To which I answered that still she was to be held accountable for what she had said, or at the very least, give the other woman a pass. He said that it wasn't the same because his wife is autistic and cannot hold herself (his words, not mine). I said that I didn't think that being autistic was a pass to behave like an ass without any consequences. He said it was because, and I quote ""trying to reason with her is like trying to punish a dog because he won't read the newspaper."" 

My whole purpose with the post was ""Is actually being autistic a season pass to be an asshole without consequences?"" And it's been made abundantly clear that it's not how it works. 

As for my friend, he can obviously do with his life as he sees fit. I'd like to think that I know him a tad bit to see how this is concerning, but again, it's his choice. I just don't think it's appropriate to force me to put up with her no matter what when she won't put up with anyone or anything that inconveniences her. And while they have the right to choose their life and are not the root of all evil for it, neither am I if I choose not to associate with her."

AmItheAsshole,fqm81ge,t1_fqleerz,1589473076.0,"I had to cut this post real short because of the character limitations of reddit. It was twice as long when I first tried to send it and there was way more to the story.

This woman has been torturing my friend since they met. It's not something I know from the outside, it's something that I know because I happened to be the person holding his hand while he acknowledged the situation was very toxic himself but didn't have the strength to get out, and when finally after literally testing him vs. her then boyfriend, I repeat, literally testing and giving them points, she decided that he was good enough for her, she ate his whole life.

This is not only her fault, absolutely not. She's manipulative AF, but he's also a blindsided idiot when it comes to this. 

I don't live in their relationship, but I have been through thick and thin with my friend and his personality has suffered a 180Â° turn since being with her.

His wife will throw tantrums if he attempts to spend time alone with someone (including his family) because he's not ALLOWED to. In what world isn't that f-up? His wonderful sister has had to witness this woman disrespecting the whole family blatantly, and has seen how my friend has made excuses for her because it's everyone else who doesn't get her.

Nobody in his family circle or friend circle agreed with this wedding. Even the only friend that this woman has, has voiced her concerns about this relationship.

I wrote here to seek an outer perspective of whether or not I was being insensitive towards her so called condition, not because I think I'm wrong in not liking her but because I was concerned that maybe I was missing something and actually autistic people can't hold themselves at all, which apparently is not a thing. 

I have obviously tried to like her for my friend's sake, but she has no respect for anyone. She told a friend of mine to die. She tried to prevent my friend from coming to my wedding (he was going to be my husband's best man and in the end he was not), and when eventually they did, they left two hours later because she didn't feel like being there. I've seen her ridicule my friend in front of others. I've seen her make the death of her uncle about her and how his uncle dying had ruined her spa weekend. Her mistreat his sister, her throwing snarky remarks to his mother. I can't like her, and I don't like what she's done to my friend who can't see this while literally everyone else around him sees it. 

I don't know one person around them, not one, and we have plenty of friends in common as well as are well acquaintanced with our families, not one person who thinks that what is going on is right or that he's in his own mind.

He's never done drugs and now he is because she likes it. He's always been incredibly aware and caring for others, and now she chooses to buy herself a freaking swastika necklace to make a point of how it's ""just a symbol"" when his sister has been beaten up by neo-nazis, and he sees no issue with it. 

I can go on and on about this stuff, that may not be about how she's personally. Well she likes TV series, tattoos, gothic stuff, american 50's style, dragonfruit, cats, literature, lately she's been really into pink, homemade margaritas and travelling. She's all this, and also she's all of the pretty awful things listed above that do not compensate her margarita making skills. 

By the way. How exactly am I judging her sexual choices? Because I'm honestly at a loss with that one."

Look, because if you take this the right way it can really help you in your dating life. What most people don't realize, is that the reason they're not dating is that they have little to offer (or such is the impression they cause). 

I've dated really hot guys, average guys and ugly guys. Really hot guys sure get the most attraction, but if there's nothing to accompany the Apollo look, it doesn't last. It's fantastic to shag a guy who looks like he's been sculpted by the gods, but nobody stays in a relationship for the looks if you're as interesting as a building brick.

I've dated ugly guys who were incredibly charismatic, fun to be around and knew how to be sexy. The point is that they know that their face is not all that they have to offer, and it is a non issue because they never act like it is an issue.

Now there are ugly guys out there which identity is based on being the poor ugly guy that never has dated because oh why did the gods curse me with this face! Those are no fun to have around, and it doesn't have to do with them being ugly.

It's pretty much like the Good Guy TM who is plain AF and bases his entire identity on being a decent human being as if it wasn't the bare minimum and expects a medal for it.

AMA,flflu7y,t3_fo8vdx,1585110090.0,"I'm so sorry for your loss. What a terrible situation. It's not great consolation but you've done all that you could do and you've been there by all means possible and he left knewing that.

Much love to you."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fl8m7hd,t1_fl8l26l,1584926933.0,"Hi, I live in Spain where we have been in a lockdown for a week already and almost 2k have lost their lives. But sure, all we've got to worry about is making your jackass president look bad. 

The american entitlement is real... Lol.

P.S. Hollywood, I've done my part. When's my check coming in?"
AmItheAsshole,fl749vd,t3_fmxpsb,1584893903.0,"NTA. This situation sucks, and Clair must be devastated, but this is why you don't organize weddings that you cannot afford without people chipping in. Many people are losing their jobs now and don't know when they will next see money and have enough with their own responsibilities to be also responsible for someone else's party expenses."
AmItheAsshole,fl3r8s7,t3_fm7i2i,1584795770.0,NTA. And kilts are hot AF!
AmItheAsshole,fklkokb,t1_fkka7h9,1584308573.0,"Ask your mother how she'd feel about giving your father's ashes to her MIL and probably you'll get a different answer. Cremated remains should go with whomever the deceased wanted them to go. Mommies, good or bad ones, have no say here."
AmItheAsshole,fk9giyg,t3_fh7ubc,1583975617.0,"YTA. There are other solutions to this, such as air filters, intense fur combing, fur lotions that help maintain the allergens under control and there are even medications that you can give to the cat for her to reduce her allergens. 

Besides, allergies to fur are very seldom anaphylactic as long as there are no preexisting conditions. I'm talking as someone who's allergic, with an allergic and asthmatic husband, who has three cats and we're both well and alive and don't struggle to exist or have discomfort with these measures."
AmItheAsshole,fk5uovp,t3_fgg4k4,1583888221.0,"The vocabulary that you're using ""She's inherited get father's *thin* lips"" or ""it has really balanced out her face"" tells me that most likely, your daughter's complex is not entirely self-made and that you have probably contributed to it. YTA"

AmItheAsshole,fjrc04u,t3_fenhld,1583583714.0,This has nothing to do with money and YTA big time.
Assistance,fjlxg6y,t1_fjlx9o6,1583456722.0,Thank you. My condolences to you. It's always terrible to lose them ðŸ’œ
AmItheAsshole,fjl2kon,t3_fdq2s5,1583438699.0,NTA. And your husband isn't helping you raise his effing spawn. It's his responsibility. His duty. Not his good action of the day.
relationship_advice,fjl23rp,t3_fdww9r,1583438433.0,"This is some Abrahamic shit so deeply ingrained in the brains of us women. 

Your body count is nobody's business for starters. Now, if you decide to share, and it makes a difference for the person you're seeing, good riddance! You don't need that. 

Having sex has nothing to do with your value as a person, has nothing to do with your relationship ethics and has nothing to do with respecting your body or yourself. Anyone who tells you different, doesn't deserve you, not the other way around.

And before people start claiming the right of someone to reject a partner for this, I have to say yes, you have the perfect right to reject a partner for their sexual past, same as you have the right to reject a partner because their penis is small, because their breath smell or because they're bald. Any reason why you don't want to be with someone is enough for not being with someone, nobody can force you, yet you can still be regarded as an idiot."

JUSTNOMIL,fjjtwyy,t3_fdohqv,1583412044.0,"Thank you very much guys for all the support. The loss is being terrible. I have lost furbabies before, but in different circumstances. It was still an awful time, but it was easier to accept because they had fulfilled their life expectancy, they had had a long, beautiful life. My furbaby was just 2 and he left us to an unexpected cardiorespiratory arrest, we had rescued him only 7 months ago and he was just beginning to live the beautiful and coddled life that we had prepared for him. We left him overnight at the vet because he had fainted, vet said that it was no biggie and he would recover with fluids (he had other issues but none of them were life threatening or really concerning) I called in the middle of the night to see how he was doing and vet said he was real good, he had picked up his temperature and he was now going to eat some food and not to worry. Three hours later we were waken up by a phonecall from the vet with the news. I feel so terrible when I think that he was there alone, I hate to think that he may believe that we had abandoned him there.

Having to deal with these kind of ""condolences"" only makes it suck more."
AmItheAsshole,fj8dnap,t3_fbpy2c,1583110958.0,"ESH. You offered to play at her wedding. Offered. Offering to do something is free and no strings attached to the offered part. On the other hand, your sister should have made sure you had decent food to eat."
JUSTNOMIL,fitbx1n,t1_fiq2glj,1582713998.0,"No, the bank paperwork that they needed to get done was a long due issue with the father's VB inheritance. He had a shared account with his mother that he didn't want to have anymore where he had left part of his inheritance, so he wanted to sort it out to get his money into our account and close the joint account with his mother. 

He had wanted to do this for ages and she always gave an excuse, except on the day of my father's wedding when, apparently, she was available to get it done."
JUSTNOMIL,fipvves,t3_f8xg1q,1582624107.0,"Additional information: I thought this is relevant and I forgot to include it. The Widow TM works at the hospital, hence why she knows where he goes or doesn't go. And more people than doctors work there, so people at the reception can tell her ""hey I saw your son!"" or give her information.  

No, there are no other hospitals in the area, and I'm not moving and changing my whole life because JNMIL can't control herself."
JUSTNOMIL,fipvo9h,t1_fiomrnu,1582623806.0,"So much this! He's ended up going and I'm pissed because he's only encouraging this behaviour. He said ""well, actually I needed to go to the doctor for this"" and I get it, but going when JNMIL wants him to go is not going to make her stop!"
