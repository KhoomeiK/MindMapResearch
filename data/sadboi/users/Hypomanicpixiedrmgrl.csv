stopdrinking,fnbidak,t3_g0flfg,1586816058.0,Hit the 2 week mark !!! Longest I‚Äôve been sober since I relapsed after rehab in January. I feel fan-fucking-tastic
stopdrinking,fmwz49a,t1_fmt9ahb,1586455579.0,Thank you!!!!
stopdrinking,fmt3m7z,t1_fmt2dda,1586366329.0,"As far as I know it only makes you deathly ill if you drink it, it‚Äôs a hell of a motivator. Plus once you‚Äôve been taking it for a while it builds up in your system and you would have to wait 2 weeks since stopping to start again. At first I thought the idea of a ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù pill was crazy to me but it‚Äôs honestly keeping me so motivated. I barely have cravings but I think it‚Äôs psychological."
stopdrinking,fmt1svt,t1_fmszl41,1586365493.0,It‚Äôs working so well! If there are any side effects I can‚Äôt tell. Right now my body just feels so good to be sober. I decided to take it when multiple outpatient and inpatient rehabs and vivitrol shots didn‚Äôt seem to stop me completely
stopdrinking,fmt1lem,t1_fmt0278,1586365397.0,Thank you üôè especially during this time of isolation I think this sub will be more important than ever
stopdrinking,fmt1h5v,t1_fmszv0c,1586365344.0,Ethyl alcohol haha
ptsd,fmrdqnr,t1_fmradhd,1586320296.0,I meant good as a comparative term to the hell of trauma response. I still feel terrible about what‚Äôs going on but it‚Äôs a different feeling than PTSD.
ptsd,fmpvxg7,t1_fmpvuke,1586288317.0,Glad to hear because I was feeling a little guilty about it
stopdrinking,f9kvbtz,t3_e5d430,1575408600.0,"When I tapered myself I used the HAMS method but I don‚Äôt know of any applications  https://hams.cc/taper/

I feel an obligation to say it is safest when tapering under medical attention, whether that be an outpatient taper or inpatient detox. I also understand many people do not have that luxury due to many reasons.

You‚Äôve got this. I have been/am with you now."
bipolar,f54f0vy,t1_f54ejm4,1571979912.0,I have not watched the whole series but it is not explicitly stated (also hesitating to say because of spoilers). It hit home so hard I feel it's some sort of metaphor for it.
bipolar,f2x1g4c,t1_f2x0flx,1570472676.0,Haha love the snooze strategy. Yes I think maybe taking a step back is good and phoning people I know well. I moved across the country last year and it hasn‚Äôt been easy to find my people here.
bipolar,f2x18e1,t1_f2wz38f,1570472602.0,Thank you üíú
bipolar,f2apiph,t3_dcp7oq,1570116212.0,"Zoloft is an SSRI which leaves more naturally produced serotonin around in your brain to work longer before being recycled. With some people with bipolar, this increase in serotonin can trigger a manic episode. It‚Äôs actually how I was diagnosed (quickly got off the medication). For other people this increase in serotonin is a miracle for depression. Then there‚Äôs the folks in the middle where it just doesn‚Äôt help. 

Unfortunately with a lot of bipolar meds it‚Äôs trial and error, which is why it‚Äôs important to have your doc monitoring you and possibly tell someone that‚Äôs close to you to see if they notice any changes. 

There are other classes of medications which you could also try that don‚Äôt have this risk, but they have other different side effects. 

Everyone is different and hopefully you‚Äôll find a medication or combination that works for you soon."
bipolar,f1w9v9b,t3_dayauj,1569782132.0,I want to smash shit. Office space style. Throw a beer bottle at a tree and yell.
bipolar,f1w7lp4,t1_f1vxm3i,1569781297.0,It‚Äôs so disorienting to feel so absolutely right and wrong about things at the same time
bipolar,f1w74pz,t1_f1vzge0,1569781124.0,"It really is always the people you love the most. When I get back to a better place that manic state feels so alien. I think to myself, ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs not *me* who acted like that‚Äù. 

But it is me. It‚Äôs a part of me I don‚Äôt know how to handle."
bipolar,ezc0jmh,t1_ezbz6q7,1567828048.0,‚ù§Ô∏è I can‚Äôt speak to your experience but I relate to how agitating that feels. If you want to chat feel free to PM me. Hope it passes soon - you got this.
bipolar,ezbyx6c,t3_d0m40n,1567827376.0,"I had to pull over on the side of the road recently and pour all of my thoughts into the notes app on my phone - almost missed a meeting because I was lost in my own mind 

Brain go fast"
