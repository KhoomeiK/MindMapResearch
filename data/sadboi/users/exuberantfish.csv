antidepressants,fq85e0l,t3_ghc9iu,1589158840.0,I take adderall and my heart rate used to be pretty insane (up to 140 bpm when it was kicking in and then 90-120 bpm until it wore off) although I am only 18 so that makes it a little less crazy. It took at least a few months for my heart rate to not spike like crazy after taking it. Now there’s only a slight increase in my heart rate. So it could probably take months but I bet you will adjust eventually like I did.

However I can tell you this, if you go to a psychiatrist and they suggest meds they will most likely prescribe an SSRI. SSRI’s don’t have a super high success rate, didn’t work for me, but they work for some. So you can look into them if you want. There are other options too but SSRI’s are almost always the first option for treatment. Hope you can get to the bottom of your problem:)"

anhedonia,fpox8c0,t1_fpo557d,1588792219.0,"Yeah there’s countless studies on dopamine but there aren’t many on anhedonia. Wellbutrin is a dopamingeric antidepressant than many find success with. Adhd meds like adderall and ritalin are dopamine reuptake inhibitors as well and they are extremely effective for depression and anhedonia.

Dopamine is the neurotransmitter that mainly affects memory, concentration, motivation, and feelings of pleasure. I believe a lack of dopamine is a big factor of anhedonia. I have adhd and was depressed and anhedonic but then I get prescribed adderall. Adhd gone, depression gone, anhedonia mostly gone. All because of adderall. Dopamingeric drugs are the shit"
anhedonia,fpo1nps,t3_gel2wk,1588776758.0,Yes because it increases dopamine

AskDrugNerds,fp40mv9,t3_gax1mh,1588289365.0,"I’ve heard that both magnesium and melatonin help decrease tolerance (they also promote relaxation and sleep) because they help regulate the neurotransmitters. There’s not many sources about it so I’m not sure if it’s really true but a lot of people think so. It could be that they seem to decrease tolerance just because they help you get better sleep at night, so you’re more well rested. 

Weed with stimulants can be good but not if you have anxiety or tend to get paranoid when you smoke. The stim will make the high really strong and intense. I did it once (before class like a dumbass) and I had a pretty bad experience. It would probably be better with an indica rather than sativa."

anhedonia,fnxv8le,t3_g4i4gm,1587347059.0,"Ssri’s sometimes cause or worsen anhedonia. I’ve found that dopamine reuptake inhibitors are the only drugs that decrease anhedonia. This is because they allow more dopamine production in the brain. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter responsible for feelings of pleasure and motivation. I believe Wellbutrin is the only antidepressant that’s a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Other (and more powerful) options are adhd drugs; adderall, ritalin, vyvanse, but these are much harder to get prescribed because they’re controlled substances. However there is no cure. Anhedonia is better than depression in my opinion but it still sucks. It needs to be researched more."
