Stormlight_Archive,foptogs,t1_foo9kxl,1587971783.0,"I'm making a guess here - the dustbringers can disintegrate anything, so stone is no problem. I suspect they do it in a way that is a lot more general purpose and less difficult than soulcasting, because they can cut a masterwork engraving into a wooden table. If you wanted to go to shadesmar to tell a table to become a carved table, that would be really hard because the table thinks of itself as a whole. That's why most people carve say wax into the shape they want and then soulcast it to stone or wood. 

So the the cutting of the shattered plains into completely symmetrical plateaus the dustbringers would be a natural fit, as seen in the one example of them in action. I suspect that a dustbringer could use their powers on people to do more than make a thief turn to fire, they could carve the thief up internally for maximum pain without killing them. 

&#x200B;

Whoever shattered the plains made perfectly vertical slots into the rock, and then the water eroded the bottoms to widen them. They also spared the oathgate which was the only deviation from the perfect symmetry of the shattered plains plateau layout, which means they intentionally spared it.

&#x200B;

I suspect that Bondsmiths should be able to make the plains remember what it was like to be whole, and this might be a good idea at the time, once they put it back together they'll find out the strategically important thing that had to be denied to the enemy suddenly becomes important again which might actually make them want to shatter the plains again to be safe."

UnsentLetters,fnyapax,t1_fny74vq,1587357703.0,"It's those little details and contradictions the quirks that made us human. 

Initially I was intoxicated by this person, she seemed so much more real and three dimensional than everyone else I knew.

I kept it light at first, warning i meme a lot so if ever i got annoying feel free to mute me and that i wouldn't mind. I've made that promise two thousand times and up until that day i had never broken it.


 I thought that she absolutely had to be a fabrication. And so I gathered up all my vacation money and took a ten days off work right before a giant product demonstration to a government client. 

I went there to calibrate myself to reality. Nobody could be that perfect. She was a plant mom, but all the plants were carniverous. She loved Dr Who but the signed poster was Paul McGann whose Dr Who movie went direct to video and even I hadn't seen. Her love for cosmic horror had her choose Azathoth as the deity she'd sing to sleep. I'm a color out of space fan myself, because everybody listens to Cthulhu. 

I was sure it was a shell. So I flew six hours in a propeller plane to meet her in her regional city.

There was a neonazi in the seat in airplane front of me with Sigrunes on one side of his skull and 13 on the other. She was embarrassed for her town for that and said she would fight him or at least spill her drink on him. I said the journey had been peaceful, the color of my skin never coming up as an issue. I felt sorry for that man, I said, a man gets those tattoos so young in life has known no peace and will be fighting every day thereafter. 

And when I met her, for six hours she was everything she claimed to be. I met her family. We all got along together. We had a great dinner. And I took her back to her home and bid her goodnight at 10pm to show respect to her and her house, and because in person she seemed very young at 22, and i felt very old.

I was in town for another two days and I kept the conversation light. She didn't offer to meet up and I didn't press the issue. 

On my last night in town I went to a bar called the Giddy Goat, the only nightclub in the city. I felt very alone and rejected and close to an alcoholic relapse. So I looked at the $3 spirits menu and ordered plain orange juice every five minutes to keep my face busy.

While I was there, I saw somebody who looked just like her, only her hair was curly. And I thought in that moment I don't want to talk to somebody who looks like her, I want to talk to her. 

The woman at the bar with the curly hair saw me and her eyes became wide, and she quickly left with her friends. 

I went home and on my phone was a message from her with a picture of a new kitten. I asked if I could come over to say hello to the kitten and goodbye to her but she said no. 

I had to go home and work any way. Work was already assigning tasks to me for my return. 

I messaged her once a week for a month after I got home, sending her all of her favorite things. She would repost them to her social media but never reply me. I finally drew the original artwork we had talked about in the months before our date, but she seemed to have put me on mute. I could tell that she wasn't self isolating. she would delete my comments from her posts like she was embarrassed of me while new men would share in jokes with her about her dreams to travel to scotland where he could loan her his couch.

i retaliated childishly, taking a detour on a business trip to see a friend and making it look on social media more romantic than it was.

at the end of a month i wote a public post on my wall that said ""after years of looking down on niceguys and making fun of them for not being able to control themselves, i have finally recieved a rejection that i am not immediately able to accept. i get it now. i have finally experienced nice guy rage. but the mission remains the same- to be a good man instead. whatever that means."" 

a friend of mine told me that i was not one of those fake nice guys who hate women, and that i would find the right person one day. she heart reacted my friend's reply.

i spent the whole day at work going mad trying to decypher the kremlinology of that heart react. 

she started heart reacting all my posts, but still said nothing on messenger.

i asked a few trusted female friends about this and they told me to block her immediately, they said she was manipulating me. that it was causing too much pain and angst.

i gave her 24 hours, and then i blocked her, the first person I've ever blocked in my life. 

that was a month ago. i still dream about her. i fell out with my close female friend because i realized that my confidante treated relationships like this one disposably, whereas i only have met two people i have clicked with in my life, including this person.

she told me some very personal stories over our date together. i thought i held space for them, but maybe she thought that me continuing to keep things light like they were at the start was a sign that I'd never commit. that i wouldn't be captured by her, ever wanting to know more.

it was all too much and i focused on work. the one thing I'm good at. so i did that product demo and we sold that contract. i traded her for a bonus and a challenge coin. 

and now i can't forget her."
