I know that Anet has shrunk in general, as have releases, but what's the current state of the community from people who still actively play it? Is GW2 shrinking in playerbase, or is it still as active as it used to be?"

TooAfraidToAsk,ffi287s,t3_etl02h,1579962923.0,"My father vehemently believes it. He's also massively racist, bigoted, and thinks that he can walk into a modern store and buy $500 worth of stuff and they owe him a ""discount"" or ""free delivery"" just because he says so. 

I am shocked sometimes by the shit he says.
Too bad he doesn't know I'm gay. Maybe then he'd stop making so many comments about others. 

That's off topic though. Point is, that's mostly a... ""Boomer"" thing. That, and the Bommerettes and redneck population. Those unaware of anything but ""America good everywhere else bad"".

I've been considering coming back (left after doing all the release PoF content and getting the mounts, etc.) but the layoffs and general downward trend doesn't look good. I've also heard that recently released content has certainly been under par and that's there's very little chance for a third expansion or much more Living Story.

What helps is different for everyone. I watch Him Appetit and Binging with Babish videos to mellow out, usually doing pretty mindless stuff like that for a few minutes helps. To do stuff like practicing for the license, you just have to keep the big picture in mind. 

You can do it."
bipolar,erge7w3,t3_c1ndgp,1560835607.0,"I know I'm a bit late to it, but try to keep your chin up. My best friend and boyfriend (two separate people) both have bipolar. I don't know how that worked out, but I've been dating one for three years and friends with the other for slightly longer. I've seen a lot of the struggles and wish I could personally understand it more.

I know it's rough. I've seen both of them lose friends, gain them, and cycle again. Eventually we all sort of banded together and exist in a social circle that's pretty accepting and understanding. You can do it, everyone can, especially considering how severe it is for my friend. Please don't give up. I promise you, you'll find the people who will be able to see through the swings and will try their best to comfort you in the dumbest ways when they know it definitely won't work entirely. 

It's painful. Seeing people go always is. But trust me - the right people are out there. I've been through a lot myself, so while I don't have bipolar, I've come to certain understandings. 

If you ever just need to vent, my inbox is open.
Hope you sleep well.

EDIT: Read down and saw you have issues even meeting people. It never does get easier - best to break that one out quickly. I have friends both online and RL. Of course, online is easier, but RL is just more of a leap than a truly Herculean task. Try to find local hobby groups - card/comic shops are a great way to do this if you're into board games, pen and paper RPGs, or TCG. If not, hey, you can keep looking around. Shops like that and other centers of interest hold events regularly, so try and scope those out. 

I hate to say this, but I've come to realize something over time. If they can't see through the bipolar and are incapable of realizing what you're going through at at least some level, they probably weren't going to work out. Close friends are hard to come by, but you need to make that leap first to get there. Again, my inbox is open - I'm happy to try and scoot you along a little or give some advice to try and meet new people. It's important. 

The best friends can hear your words and see your expression but still listen to your feelings.

Good luck. <3"
