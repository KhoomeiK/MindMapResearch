As to my face getting white! Even after so long it’s odd but it is mostly about feeling good about yourself 

All around my eyes used to be white but turned brown just by sun exposure I guess"

I cannot imaging the positivity I would have felt then with internet groups, models, or just every day people embracing “body positivity” or acceptance in many areas that weren’t so accepted in my early 20’s.

It definitely takes time to embrace it and everyone certainly comes to that in their own time. Now I seriously am after 50 Idgaf about what anyone is thinking. I’ve experienced so many life altering issues, debilitating grief or back surgery, losing my sight in one eye the vitiligo is the least of any issue I personally have"

Vitiligo,fqbol88,t1_fqboacg,1589240921.0,Stress definitely impacted mine spreading. It spread a bit with hormone changes and have my daughter 28 years ag but 10 years ago when my late husband got cancer.... I playin ole turned white. It also became increasingly insignificant to me as it doesn’t harm me. Those that matter don’t mind and those that mind don’t matter

The person that falls in love with you will see your white as amazing 
The thing that’s even more important you will see the amazing beauty of your skin. It’s you. You are amazing.

I think grief is very difficult and people, well at least I underestimated it until having a great loss. I think perhaps and it’s just a perhaps, Mindy losing her sister and having a miscarriage left a deeper hole than she may have addressed and she seemed to gain some strength

I can’t get with much about Taylor really"
MarriedAtFirstSight,fmcnk9n,t1_fmcmdml,1585949123.0,I don’t think much of either of them. Nor of most of the people this season really except it’s great to see Austin and Jessica and Derek has acted very sweetly to Katie although I don’t think anything of her behavior
MarriedAtFirstSight,fmcj6b0,t1_fmccswk,1585946692.0,We’ll see obviously is petty Betty by instagram video. She was talking in circles. They both play the victim but she hadn’t said nor has Brandon that he goes out partying until 3 am. I actually don’t think keeping those hours are fair in marriage but being they don’t particularly care for one another she has continued to party per her routine.

At the catholic mass memorial (he was cremated) in the church at the end she yelled out something. At this point I don’t remember.
I do remember leaving her a message saying that “he loved that church, he withered away and I was the only one caring for him, you were always irrelevant”
