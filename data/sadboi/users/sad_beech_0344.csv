SuicideWatch,folx2ix,t1_folsj7n,1587872559.0,"I’m so sorry you are upset, it sounds like you may be at war with yourself and this is causing you some undue stress. I understand that you feel the need to take care of others before yourself. That is absolutely something that I do with those that I love. Just don’t forget yourself. There will always be a way to take time to address your own inner demons. 

The biggest thing I advocate for is not changing yourself to the point where you don’t feel like yourself, and I may have not made that clear in my past responses and for that I am really sorry, but you can change your responses. I’m big on training your mind to accept you have inner demons but not giving them power. It a huge thing to do, but I swear to you it helps.

Happy, however, does not have to hurt. That is something you have trained yourself to feel, and that is where changing your response to negative thoughts comes into play. 

In regards to the parent thing and sibling order, I did not mean to make it seem like I was saying to blame your parents or anything of that sort. When you look into the psychology, there are strong debates on the fact that the first child state of mind is pure human nature. Your parents sound like they are trying their hardest to support you through this, and that is commendable. It is just ingrained in us to pass down our own childhood experiences and beliefs or to strive to make it different. 

I think you have the power to help so many, and it sounds like you are already trying really hard to make the lives of your family and friends around you good. The biggest thing I’d like to end with is just stay conscious of the power you give your negative thoughts and inner demons, they will always be with you but they don’t have to control how you feel. You can do this.

Also, I was just offering a voice chat if you were interested because I have a hard time portraying what I’m try to through typing lol. My wording sometimes comes off the opposite of what I mean. Call it my forever struggle lol.

Please, if you ever need a friend to listen and understand or you need advice of any kind that I can help with, reach out to me. My DM is always available. I want you to reach out if you need to. I love being able to relate to someone so much through life experiences. What worked for me may not be what you need, but I’m willing to help you figure out whatever it is you need. Stay strong!"

SuicideWatch,fold47x,t1_foispo3,1587859678.0,"If I may be so bold as to say, I am getting a feeling we have been through some of the exact same turmoil with our lives. I’m truly in awe over how much I relate to the stories you’ve told me and the feelings you are dealing with.

I’m gonna start off by addressing your second paragraph where you say you still feel others pain. I took the way you said that as you see someone in pain, whether physical or mental, and you care deeply. If I’m wrong, I’m sorry I misunderstood, but I’d like to say if I read that right that is the definition of empathy. It sounds like maybe you just feel empathetic toward people that are just in pain, maybe people that you can sense are dealing with similar situations to you. I truly think you need to give yourself more credit. 

In terms of feeling at one point empathetic and then having the feeling that you are not empathetic at all is a very confusing thing and can be adding to this stress you are definitely experiencing. I feel like I went through something similar where I was so back and forth, as in I would care so deeply one second and then not care at all. It’s also happens with my emotions, I’m either enraged or I’m numb. I can’t be just kinda angry or just a bit happy. It’s black or white with my emotion, there is no spectrum. Does this sound like something that you would say you deal with?

In regards to what you said about the god complex you experience, thank you by the way for going into a bit more detail for me, I have been there. I was in an online relationship for two years. I had never met the guy in person, but I grew to know him as if he had been in my life for years and years. It became very toxic, and I was the one causing the issues I will admit. I definitely knew this guy would submit to whatever I wanted or asked, and that grew into habits such as possessiveness and the desire to incite reactions from basically tormenting him. I wanted him to tell me how much I meant to him, and I got off on playing awful, hideous tricks on him. I wanted him to understand that he was mine, he would be mine and no one else would be allowed to be near him or in contact. I am not proud of what I did with this guy, and I certainly allowed my dark side to control how I treated him. 

And you wanna know how I came out of that relationship? Feeling undeserving of love, admiration, and just basically unsuitable for relationships. Pretty much like you described. I felt incredibly messed up and at one point I allowed myself to believe I was insane and I would probably end up dead or in jail. 

I am living proof that you can overcome those feelings. It took time, but honestly the biggest thing is you just have to find someone that will not allow you to “walk all over them”. I mean that in the most respectable way. If you know someone who is submissive turns you into someone that you can’t stand looking at in the mirror, then that is not right for you. 

I had to learn for myself that even though I wanted someone to be submissive to me and that I needed the control in relationships, that is not what I needed. I needed someone to match me, not to submit or dominate, but someone that could meet me in the middle and keep me from going too far down the dominant path, but at the same time allowing me to have some control. It’s a hard thing to learn, and it’s not easy giving up that side of you that you know you have the tendency to be, but in the end it is truly mind over matter. You can teach yourself to be different. 

In terms of the last few paragraphs about your parents and your desire to exist for the purpose of helping others despite yourself, this ties into the question about your siblings and your order in line. You are the oldest, and I am the oldest as well. This one is pure psychological, and I think it’s genuinely fun to research the psychology of being the oldest sibling. As the oldest sibling, you are your parents first. Kinda like a guinea pig in a lab. As much as parents mean well, they aim to make you into the perfect child that they wish they could have been or be the child that they weren’t when they were young. It is so hard for parents to allow first borns to just grow up to be themselves.

As a direct result, this conditions the first child to be a “pleaser”. They believe their sole purpose in life is to make others happy. You strive to make your parents happy. That is the psychology of the first born. You feel like you need to be perfect in order for you to earn your parents love. For example, when I failed a test in school or got anything below a B it was a huge deal in my family. This was because my mother dropped out of Highschool and didn’t have opportunities that other people got, resulting in a life she was unhappy with. So my mom was hell bent on ensuring I passed with flying colors. If I came home with something I knew was unacceptable, I just automatically knew I would be in trouble. This led to extreme anxiety. I grew up understanding that the only way I would be happy is if my parents were happy, and then in adulthood that translated into ensuring someone would make me happy and I would need that control so that everything would be perfect.

I’m so sorry this is getting long, if you got to this point thank you for sticking with me, I swear I’m getting to something lol. Anyways, to this day in your life you still feel the need to please and make up for the things you felt as if you didn’t do enough, or become what your mom may have wanted you to be. 

You are your own person. You need to care for your own burdens before attempting to lift others’. You were raised to be unselfish, and that is why you feel so guilty for allowing people to admire or care about you. Personally, as a child I was told I was selfish for the smallest things. I was taught that I was not allowed to do things for myself, I was there to please my parents. My mom denies this, but it’s really not her fault. Most parents do this subconsciously. Now, as an older person you have never been allowed to be selfish so that manifested into being possessive and dominant, not just in relationships but in your day to day life. And then the side of you that was raised to be a pleaser and selfless comes out and makes you feel like awful, causing your mind to be at war with itself.

So, you should not stop trying to help others. As someone who does the same, I couldn’t forgive myself if I didn’t help my friend who was in need. But I also needed to understand without taking care of myself I wouldn’t be able to take care of my friends and family. You just need to learn how to love yourself and allow yourself time to care for your mind.

And please, you have no reason to pay me. I am here because I get genuine joy from be able to assist others through whatever they are going through, and if I didn’t want to be here I wouldn’t be. I’m sorry if that’s blunt lol, I’m just trying to say that I care about your pain and I would genuinely like to try and help you get through this. This was me at one point, and I know how much it hurts and how hard it is. If you’d like, I can dm you my information and I would be more than happy to voice chat or just send you the information I researched that allowed me to learn how to change myself so that I could be able to take a deep breath and simply  be myself. If not, that is absolutely okay. Whatever you need to do for yourself, please do so. You need to take care of yourself a bit more. Allow yourself to recognize your value!"

It is always their own problem, and they will never be honest without you about it because it makes them look vulnerable. I know it sounds hard, but if you worry about all of the reasons they did it you are hurting yourself more. You have to acknowledge this awful situation happened and then allow yourself to move forward from it.

In terms of the eating thing, I felt that way right before I fell deep into an eating disorder. I know someone already commented this, but a therapist can really help you find a way to cope with that! I would also, if you can after getting to a therapist, look into a certified nutritionist about your weight if you are truly not feeling results. I couldn’t lose weight, and I gained weight so fast it was shocking. I had an underlying illness that caused that, and my nutritionist helped me find the right diet for my body so that I could be healthy. 

Also, one thing I can say is don’t worry about how you look or numbers on a scale so much in a weight loss journey. Focus more on how you feel, and with that it keeps you in a positive mindset. As I get healthier, I am starting to feel physically better, and that is so encouraging. That will help you from getting caught up in the discouraging side of things, like if you are focused on your looks, you don’t know what is happening deep down in your body. You won’t see a change for quite a while, but you can feel changes pretty quickly. Take your time, if you tell yourself you can do it and get there, you absolutely will. By staying positive you are only helping yourself getting better faster.

Good luck, you can do this! I believe in you!!"

Hair is a huge social construct. Without my hair, I had to learn to be the person underneath it. It is quite the freeing feeling to just get rid of something people put so much value in.

helpme,foimpaj,t3_g7m2d5,1587790654.0,"Have you confided in your s/o about the severity of this depression and anxiety? You are so important to them, I can just tell by the way you talk about your feelings about them. Allow them to be your shoulder, and ask them to help carry more of the weight so that you can get a chance to breathe. You can ask that of a s/o. When you aren’t happy, then your relationship won’t be happy. You can’t just take care of them, you have to take care of yourself. If that means a break, then so be it. The biggest thing is to make sure that you keep communication open and consistent. Don’t just drop off of the face of the earth.

For me, I let my s/o at the time know that I needed to get my mental health in check, and it was absolutely not their fault, I just needed to take care of myself so I could get strong to help take care of them. The biggest mistake I ever made was not keeping communication with them. It can be as simple as a text saying that you are thinking about them or saying I’m going to take this week to disconnect, you won’t hear from me until the end of the week etc. I lost someone I cared for by asking for a break and then not initiating conversation to let them know I still wanted them when I was better.

Depression is normal when you are under that kind of stress. When you address each bad situation make sure to do it ONE at a time. And allow yourself to take time. It was important for me to recognize that I wouldn’t die. Like, if I didn’t pay a loan back on time it wouldn’t literally kill me. It would have consequences later, yes, but I can deal with that when it comes time. 

The best way to prevent falling into that depression is to handle the most pressing situation first, and then working from there slowly. And that can be your mental state. There is always opportunities to fix school, so even if you are behind, it may just be because you need to find a different way to complete it. How to do that, I couldn’t help. Research programs that can extend schooling, or if you think you won’t make it to graduation (I was there I know it absolutely sucks) try looking into getting a GED. Trust me, jobs and colleges in the future won’t care how or when you finished school, just simply that you did. 

Give yourself time to heal. Make time. It is possible, I am living proof it is. You can only help yourself, so give yourself the chance to try. If I can help with more advice or if you would just like to get something off of your chest, I am absolutely more than happy to be here. I believe in you, you can make it through this ❤️"

The biggest thing I can say if it helps is just breathe through the pain. When I lost my grandfather, the grief became so extreme and it came in waves. The pain of loss comes in many forms. It’s so important to recognize what is it and just allow it to happen. Breathe through it, recognize it as your brain trying to process this traumatic event, and let it pass. It’s way easier than trying to stop or bottle feelings. Eventually it will fade. You will be able to go out and hug friends or other family members and grieve together soon. You can get through this.

SuicideWatch,foikw5s,t1_fohy8tt,1587789240.0,"That’s hard, I have this thing where people will tell me things like that out of a place of support and love, but it is just not what I want to hear. It makes me angry because I don’t feel strong, I don’t believe it. It took me time to recognize I was stronger than I allowed myself to feel. 

As blunt as this is gonna sound, it was what I needed to hear and it might help you. No one will say what you want to hear, no one can fix this for you. People can help, people can guide you to better habits, but until you decide deep down for yourself that you will fix the depression it won’t change. The biggest side effect of my depression is mistrust, like when people tell me I’m strong I believe it is bullshit. 

You have yourself convinced you are a lost cause, so that proves you are able to convince yourself. Try convincing yourself you’re worth more than you let on. It sounds cheesy, and maybe even impossible, but if you cast more rocks into the positive side of things, you will eventually start to feel those positive things and believe they are true.

I started small, so for example I had convinced myself that because I had a pixie cut I would never get a boyfriend because it makes me unattractive. It was just one problem I had, and it wasn’t even the biggest one. My mom kept telling me that i would find the right person, but I would get so mad because I didn’t believe that. I couldn’t believe that, i wouldn’t allow myself that comfort. One day I just decided that enough was enough. I told myself, well maybe I’ll be worth it. Then I did it the next day. And the next. After a while, it took me a couple weeks to a month I think, I had put enough energy and belief into the positive that I truly convinced myself the universe will bring me the right person for me when it was time. I trust that thought. I had to stop worrying I wasn’t worth it because it affected my day to day. I’m young, I have time, I don’t NEED that right now. 

That was just a small problem, but the same concept can be translated into whatever pain you are coping with that is making you feel as if you are a lost cause. If I can better explain, let me know. I hope this helps, even if just a bit."
SuicideWatch,foiju0i,t1_fohhz05,1587788450.0,"I’m really sorry it took me so long to reply, my internet decided to stop working. 

What I gathered from this, if you don’t mind me making an educated guess, is that you seem to be protecting yourself from getting additionally hurt by hurting yourself more. I actually think you said that. If you put yourself in pain then outside pain won’t be so bad. 

I am curious about the God-complex you mentioned you get in relationships, I am not familiar with that wording and I would like to be on the same page with you on that if you didn’t mind explaining it for me a bit more.

Also, if I may tell you some of my story, I think it might actually be somewhat similar to yours. I grew up with a super loving mother and super hating father. My mom was a Saint in my eyes, she was simply good. But somewhere along the lines something toxic overcame my family, most likely my mother picking up on my father’s negative energies, and the environment became extremely unsuitable for a child. It wasn’t blatant abuse, either. It came on slowly and it was very subtle, subtle enough to make it go undetected until way later but bad enough to affect my adult life significantly. It became later diagnosed as PTSD. Which seemed weird to me, I hadn’t been through anything tragic enough to justify that diagnosis, right? Well I was wrong.

It can be as simple as allowing your own mind taking little situations and exploding them. For example, my mom yelled at me for something really mundane, like spilled milk I think. I took that as she really didn’t love me. And as a child, I didn’t have the knowledge that i do now where I don’t allow those thoughts to affect me. It went untreated because I never spoke up about those feelings, and it eventually grew into what you describe. When someone tells me something about myself I get so convinced it’s a lie and they want to hurt me, because my mom was passive aggressive and everything she said had some negative backing, as much and she didn’t mean for it to be that way or realize she was doing it. I just really read into everything that was said to me. Does this sound like something you experienced?

One of the biggest unrecognized coping mechanisms is allowing consistent pain to protect you from feeling any more. The only problem, it’s not a realistic way of handling your mental state for an expanded period of time. You convince yourself that you are awful, and undeserving of other people’s love. I am so there with you, I definitely have bad phases of those feelings and thoughts. 

There is an abundance of ways to train yourself to stop those thoughts, but before I go into more detail I need to know a bit more if that is okay with you. Do those thoughts that come feel rooted from anxiety or depression more? Or a bit of both? I can walk you through some exercises if I knew whether it was incited from more of a panic or more of a deep, depressed pressure kind of feeling. Also, do you happen to have siblings, and if so are you first/middle/last?"

SuicideWatch,fofzrka,t1_foeysq3,1587745658.0,"I’m happy to explain! I have not altered my dark thoughts and tendencies. I don’t believe it is possible to do so. 

The best way I can explain it is that they are like waves that come and go. Like pulses of pain. When those thoughts arrive and I’m actively thinking about them, I taught myself how to not get caught up in them. It’s like when I think about suicide for example, I used to get stuck in that wave and drown. I would obsess over it until it shut me down. I’d think I was broken, that I will never get better, and then it would become this huge overwhelming feeling that would affect how I lived my day to day life. I gave it too much power over my mind. Now, when those thoughts arise, I just acknowledge that they are apart of who I am, but I don’t give them the ability to take over. 

Pain is an absolute, real feeling rooted in one truth. You have been hurt. When you give it power to take over is when other things start to feel false and that is probably causing your anger towards the happy times. 

If I may ask, and please don’t feel obligated to respond if it’s too sensitive, but what about the good things is painful? Is it just the fact that something bad came out of something good in the past, or something else? You don’t have to be specific, it’s just that I may be able to better help explain how to respond to it if you’d like to give this activity a try.

Don’t give negative feelings and thoughts that power and control. Allow them to happen, recognize that they are just pain from deep wounds, and then let them go.

It’s not dramatic at all, it happened to you. It’s your story. Sometimes wanting today to be the last day is the only thing that can give you some sense of relief. I learned one thing throughout my short lifetime of struggle, and it’s that these thoughts are a very twisted way of our brains forcing us to survive. It’s almost like it’s telling you that you’ll be ok and that there will be ultimate peace, but only when it is time.

I can’t tell you what is best for you or that it will get better. You have to find that path for yourself. I will tell you that this pain does not have to control you. You have power over it as hard as that sounds. It’s just learning how to respond to the pain that this state puts you through. You have something good deep down in you, otherwise you wouldn’t have responding or even posted. There’s a little bit of hope, you just have to call it forward.

I learned that when thoughts of suicide or other harmful, cruel thoughts appeared that I should acknowledge them, recognize that I am in pain and it’s one of my very twisted coping mechanisms, and then I let it pass. I don’t have to give those thoughts power. I think the biggest misunderstanding is that those thoughts will stop, and they won’t. If someone says that they have never had a situation like ours, I truly believe they are telling untruths. 

Put power in something positive. It’s going to be hard, and it won’t change overnight, but you have so much more power than you know. Find that motivation to allow yourself to feel better.

SuicideWatch,foepefp,t3_g72rkf,1587710353.0,"The simple fact you said you were waiting is a good sign, it means there’s a tiny bit of hope left in you that maybe this pandemic is the reason that things have gotten bad. Personally, I would agree. This virus has stressed me out so bad that it has pushed me back into bad habits. Let this blow over.

Also, i kept a journal with notes I would say to my loved ones if I had ended up killing myself. It helped me realize I wasn’t ready. I found more reasons to stay when I was saying goodbye. 

I also made dates. I realized that as my date approached and I felt nervous it was because I wasn’t ready. Don’t force yourself into a permanent choice, and don’t force yourself to fake being okay. Just let your feelings come and go. You have more power over these thoughts than you know. Keep your head up, and if I can help guide you through some exercises to keep yourself in control let me know. I believe in you, you’ll do what is ultimately right for you."
SuicideWatch,foeox9i,t3_g713oh,1587709923.0,"This is why I have a do not resuscitate. I am not an active threat to myself, but I wanted to be prepared just in case something really bad happened. This is also a good deterrent to those who aren’t super far down the suicide road as well. There can be something worse than this life, and it is this life but with added reasons to want to die like a dependent disability. I truly believe those who have come back with disabilities are still there in their heads, and that is scarier than dying to me. Gives me chills just thinking about that."
SuicideWatch,foeoofs,t3_g72usp,1587709702.0,"If I may say so myself, I was exactly right there with my own mind. Some days I still am. I recognized that my inability to get up and just end it was a sign I was getting better, or just wasn’t ready to die despite the obsession.

I learned through meditation how to respond to those thoughts to make them less overwhelming. I had to accept that I would feel that way, that there was something wrong in my brain and the temptation to end my life will absolutely come. It is how you respond to it. 

I like to tell myself that yes, I am upset. I am hurt, and hurting especially now. This does not mean that it is the end. I have literally obsessed and set myself dates and told myself I would do it, but I never could. It’s because way, way, waaaaaay down in my subconscious I knew I wasn’t ready. 

So, if there’s any advice I can give, it’s that you have to recognize the bad and understand it does NOT control you. Neither does the good. What you put value in controls you. So try putting some stones on the good side and see if it helps. I am more than happy to give you more tips to meditate if you are interested in trying that. It is not an overnight fix, but suicide absolutely does not have to be an instant fix either. Let me know if I can help, and just know you are your own worst enemy as well as your best friend. You can get through this, just give yourself the opportunity to ❤️"
SuicideWatch,foeo39s,t3_g71aex,1587709188.0,"I’m facing this struggle too. It helps me seeing someone put my pain into words. I don’t think correction is needed though. I just had to learn to listen to my ugly thoughts and accept them as untruths. 

For example, I would have thoughts about how alone I feel. No one wants me. I had to recognize I did that to myself on purpose, it was my choice to allow myself to feel that way and I was the one distancing myself as hard as it was to admit.

That was a very tame example because I would rather avoid going into the darkest parts of my mind, but I’ve learned it through inner peace. I had a friend that explained inner peace was not a state void of violent and almost “insane” thoughts, it was recognizing them and moving forward with a different approach to them. 

I feel like I need to have pain to get off as well. I don’t know what rooted that idea, but I do know that when I consciously sit down and meditate I realize it was something that I had convinced myself of. It’s hard to break those habits, but with time and patience I have found I can altar my dark thoughts.

I don’t know if this will help or something but I guess I just wanted to say I’ve been there and it helped me. Sometimes I don’t want help. You’ll make the right decision for yourself. Let me know if there’s anything I can elaborate on since I purposely kept this vague."
Advice,foengkx,t1_foen1q8,1587708642.0,That’s actually a great idea that I hadn’t considered. Thank you!! I will definitely try that. It will get better for sure!!
SuicideWatch,foeneds,t3_g6j8sj,1587708591.0,"No, it certainly isn’t, but if I may I would like to pose a question to think about. When you die, what will you be able to say about your life?"
SuicideWatch,foemx2s,t3_g6pal6,1587708180.0,"The monotonous day to day is what kills me as well. It’s hard to break that routine, because what I found is it was my way of coping with it. If I just kept it numb and didn’t expose myself to more potential hurt I wouldn’t feel the need to end it all, if that makes sense.

I’m working on teaching myself that I won’t feel good without risking more bad. More depression, more people telling me no. Rejection is what keeps me in this unmoving phase. 

You aren’t living by doing this, you are just surviving. Sometimes you will face more hurt, but you will gain so much more if you just give it a try. That motivation is hard to find, but you’ll find it. And do so slowly. It absolutely won’t come to you overnight. Just be patient with yourself and understand it is your brains way of getting you through. If you’d like to talk more I’m always here to help, or just listen. Keep going, and one day you’ll find that first step up. I believe in you."
SuicideWatch,foemfxl,t3_g6fbu3,1587707783.0,"I feel you. For me it was one day that turned into a lifetime. It amazes me how easily your life can be fucked forever. Humans are so fragile. They keep saying I’m strong, but I feel like I’m weak. I guess what I can say is if you can keep living, do it for the good days that you can remember. Bad days will blend together, but the good ones stand out. Remember each one and thank it for coming into your life. Don’t take a stretch of “good” days for granted. And as stupid and cheesy as it sounds, there will be a good day. It took months for me to have my first one, but I will remember that strength I felt that day. It won’t get easier, it will just become more numb. I’m not saying to give up, just to accept your new normal. It will take a weight off of your chest and you can start to get up from there. Best wishes to you, I hope you get some light in your life soon."

I have a lot of technology and stuff that would be too much for a safe. I want to try one for the really valuable stuff though. Thank you for the tip! I just was hesitant about a safe because they are crazy expensive for the big ones and Id like to save as much as possible to move out."

It’s a great formula though, I haven’t found anything close to it in terms of longevity and quality. I hope you like it!"
