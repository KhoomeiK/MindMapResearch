That is a bizarre story to make up. Ha! My psychiatrist is Dr Russell Hinton in Belmont NSW Australia.

Microbiome,fcoawah,t1_fcn3z85,1577827771.0,"After all my symptoms went away we stopped doing FMTs. what was really interesting however, was that a couple of months into the process, after my depression had completely disappeared, I had to take antibiotics to treat a staph infection and by the end of the course I was mentally unwell again, we did an FMT and 2 days later the anxiety and depression etc was gone. Then maybe a year after I had completely stopped doing FMT I had to take another course of antibiotics. That time I remained well and experienced no signs of anxiety or depression. I guess my microbiome was stable by then. My sisters are still doing FMT in occasion for their bipolar 2 disorder. Now I keep my gut healthy through diet and exercise."

Mental illness symptoms developing after antibiotic use. I experienced intense bipolar 1 Disorder for 18 years. Many factors contributed to me developing bipolar, however in retrospect I am certain that overuse of antibiotics to treat a recurrent tonsilitis in my teenage years was the trigger.

Microbiome,fafib4u,t1_fadp3ga,1576023453.0,"Thanks So much! GREAT quote from Dr Bush. No I didn't clear out my large intestine with antibiotics or anything like that, as that idea freaked me out (as I know antibiotics triggered my illness in the first place), and I suspected the dysbiosis was a lack of diversity, not an overgrowth of particular species. Not clearing my gut out worked for me (and my sister's and friend in Peru). cheers"

Microbiome,fa4snz8,t3_e7nf46,1575808071.0,"I can't confirm your theory, but the research in this mice study looks promising. I know studies with mice don't always translate to humans, however.. what if it does? In my own case I am 100% sure antibiotics triggered bipolar 1 Disorder in me when I was a teenager. I experienced 18yrs of debilitating hell. I was hospitalised over a dozen times due to suicidality or psychotic mania. I'm 2016 my husband read a mouse study linking the gut to mental illness. this study showed that ""mentally ill mice"" that received a fecal transplant from healthy mice had their mental illness symptoms disappear or improve. This was enough evidence for us to give FMT a go to treat my debilitating bipolar symptoms. My psychiatrist was on board, but we had to do it DIY (as it's not clinically approved YET for mental illness). It worked miraculously. I haven't experienced depression since march 2017 or mania since Sep 2017. I'm completely med free which is unprecedented. Now there is a clinical trial in Canada treating bipolar with FMT, and my case study is soon to be published in a journal. 3 other people I know have had success treating bipolar with FMT. I'm not saying FMT will work for you, I'm just saying that I personally did FMT based on the evidence in animal studies. If you can find a donor that is extremely healthy and is safe, the risk of FMT is extremely low. You need to weigh up the risks.. what might happen if you don't do try this?? My story has nothing to do with FSHD, but has everything to do with trying FMT for an illness that is ""incurable"", and linking the gut with an illness not commonly thought to be linked to. And if antibiotics triggered my illness, this study hints that possibly the gut may have been involved in your illness.  I am the first person in the world to do FMT for bipolar and I am 100% cured. If you are going to do FMT, you absolutely need to make sure your donor is properly screened to be safe. Best wishes in your journey.

""New insight on nerve-muscle communication
The study also shed light on the possible link between gut microbes and communication between nerves and muscles.
The researchers found that germ-free mice had reduced levels of key proteins essential for the assembly and function of a neuromuscular junction -- a chemical structure that allows a motor nerve cell to communicate with a skeletal muscle fibre. These junctions allow signals to be transmitted to the muscle fibre, causing muscle contraction.""
