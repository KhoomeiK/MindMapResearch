BPD,fj1dwe4,t3_favjbp,1582918045.0,"I was the same at my worst except the mafia and gypsy part. But I can relate because I was in so much pain I needed to delude myself to feel better but didn’t. I’ve also dated like you. Never do drive that far for somebody you don’t even know that well. I learned the hard way (the BPD hard way) and got burned every time. 

It does sound like some next level shit. BPD can cause psychosis in severe cases. Sounds like what you’re experiencing. You probably drifted out of touch with reality because first you got abandoned bad and second you wasted money and 5,000 miles for nothing which made you break. I would tell a psychiatrist about this though"

Christianity,fiy3fi2,t3_fah5r2,1582831730.0,"Yeah take you’re meds. I felt like you until the age of 21 and I learned the hard way. Failed jobs, laying bed all day, didn’t do homework, horribly organized, failed highschool. People with diabetes need their meds to function just like people with mental health disorders"
