modular,fqekibk,t3_gid8hw,1589309065.0,"Regarding cost, you really have to put these things into perspective. A ""complete"" modular system (or even the components of a single voice) may well cost much more than a mass-produced standalone synthesizer, but a modular system provides much more use value by being reconfigurable and customizable to your personal needs.

You're almost never stuck wishing that the manufacturer had included some odd complex functionality since you're able to build your instrument with those things in mind. That's why it's so important to understand what you want your modular to *do* before you start blindly buying modules that you might later regret.

Sure, some folks get into modular synthesis just to explore sound and chase/collect new modules, and that's a perfectly valid option for someone with the disposable income to do so, but it's not a requirement. If you want to build a modular synth for making music, you just need to be able to ask yourself what it is that you want out of it, and be able to distinguish a want or an interest from an actual need. You can bypass a lot of heartache and buyer's remorse by limiting your module purchases to things that explicitly help you meet your goals as a musician.

If it makes sense to you to go modular—if the modular workflow is more conducive to your style of music than what you can already get in some other device, and if you have a specific and consistent need that you know modular will fulfill—then you'll appreciate the value much more in the long run, and you won't regret your purchase decision(s)."

We're talking about things that have been quite visibly shaping policy for more than a generation now.

Oh, and don't forget the rousing success the Tea Party movement had in getting Republican leadership to adopt the policies of all their right-libertarian dipshit crank demagogues; in less than a decade, the GOP went from pretending to care about public institutions to being openly hostile towards the very concept of society itself.

Our political theater has been steadily shifting further and further right since the end of the Civil Rights Movement era."

SandersForPresident,fmt1izv,t1_fmsom5m,1586365367.0,"I guess I'll have to plainly spell this out for you since your brain is fucked or something:

• The Democratic Party is not a leftist party. They are liberals, and leftists are not liberals.  
• The majority of the American left either doesn't participate in electoral politics, or is registered independent.  
• Turnout in primary elections overall is much lower than turnout in general elections.  
• Turnout in primary elections *also* self-selects. People engaged in DNC party politics enough to vote in their primary elections are also likely liberal. (Again, liberals are not leftists, and leftists are not liberals; these are two distinct groups).  
• Turnout in general elections is much higher, and the process is generally more publicized than the primary elections. By definition, the general election draws more independent voters.  
• The policies that Bernie Sanders' campaign was proposing were much further left than the boilerplate liberal platforms that the DNC has run on for the past 50 years. These leftward progressive policies have more appeal to leftist independents (and even some social moderates) than to liberals.  

To claim that the left's popularity is the reason for the Sanders campaign's failures would require some provable measure of its presence, and it's pretty hard to make the case that a liberal party's internal elections are a good place to source that data."
SandersForPresident,fmso5ro,t1_fmsnhkp,1586359206.0,Most of the left aren't registered members of the Democratic party. The electorates for general elections and primary elections are very different. Is this your first election?

Wait wtf? Obama's administration did *not* nominate RBG.

Not only that, but Biden was instrumental in getting Clarence Thomas confirmed, and he's consistently been the most conservative member of the court.

What kind of weird ass revisionism are you doing?"
SandersForPresident,fmsnbbn,t1_fmsc3v5,1586358758.0,Liberals aren't the people who like these policies. Liberals are not the left.
SandersForPresident,fmrgipx,t1_fmrb4ng,1586322523.0,"Voting for Biden only sends the message that the left will continue to show up for shitty liberals under duress.

It's not a vote for Trump, but for whatever worse version of Trump comes after the Dems manage to thrust the presidency upon another mediocre status quo center-right moderate."
