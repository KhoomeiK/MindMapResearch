I don‚Äôt work where you work. There‚Äôs no way I could make an educated decision. Many many factors go into making this decision.

For example. Maybe you are just a spoiled, whiny teenager and your parents are immunocompromised. In that case, move out or obey your parents and knock off your selfish behavior.

Maybe you are a, completely independent 20 something who has to pay rent, utilities and a car payment and who relies on your income to pay these bills. Maybe your parents are acting crazy and irrational. In that case disobey and face the consequences or just move out.

Maybe your boss is super understanding and your job is more secure than you think. Maybe you are just being paranoid. In that case, I‚Äôd say obey your parents and have peace of mind, both, with your living situation and job.

There are a million different scenarios here. No way to choose unless I have every detail and both sides of the story. This is the problem with people asking for advice. No one can make a better judgement than you because no one knows more details of the situation than you. My one suggestion is to commit to a decision and make the best of it. Look at this as practice for being independent. Good luck with your situation. I‚Äôm not sure anyone has any solid answers about anything these days with this Covid situation."

Continue to live with your parents and disobey them by going to work and preserving your job, but putting your living situation in jeopardy.

Continue to live with your parents and abide by their rules, putting your job in jeopardy.

Move out and make your own rules, but also pay your own rent and utilities, preserving your job.

Try to get a doctors note saying that you are at high risk for Covid-19, preserving your job with the doctor‚Äôs note and preserving your living situation. This will be difficult/impossible if you are not, actually at high risk though.

I have put a lot of effort into becoming self-aware to my needs as far as anxiety goes. When I start a new relationship, I simply tell the person my coping mechanisms and how to help if they choose. Music, a bath, weed, Xanax, being in nature, action movies, exercise and animals help me.

My partner will become very familiar with the music and movies that help me and play it for me if they would like to help. My partner may run a bath, suggest a walk/ hike or ask if I need some weed or Xanax. My partner might show me cute animal memes or you tube videos of animals.

Another thing that helps me is playing a Disneyland ride or show song. I am a huge Disney fan. When my partner and I imagine the ride or show and talk about what is happening at a certain point in the music, I can‚Äôt help but feel happy and excited. Instant anxiety reducer.

That law applies to men and women equally. The law was made to protect people from predators who would purposely get a person drunk or high to take advantage of them. The law was not made by women to ruin men‚Äôs lives. The law is very important and necessary.

Anyone can ruin anyone‚Äôs life by making a false accusation of rape, child abuse, cheating, etc... People are wrongly accused of crimes all of the time. It is a terrible thing.

Can we please make this about a judicial/police problem and stop trying to make this a gender thing? This kind of attitude is really toxic. I just don‚Äôt understand why you would attack women instead of the flawed, judicial system."
AskReddit,fhoks3d,t3_f3wecu,1581762071.0,"When I‚Äôm with a guy who treats me right, I love giving them. I, especially love it when the guy gives me feedback through moans or verbally. I love it because it‚Äôs servicing my man (submissive) and I‚Äôm also rewarding him (dominant) for being a great guy and being amazing in bed. Giving a blow job is enough foreplay to get me going, when I‚Äôm with the right person. I‚Äôm a total dick worshipper.

On the other hand, if a guy acts entitled to a blow job, he will not get one. If a guy doesn‚Äôt treat me right, he will not get one. If a guy has bad hygeine, he will not get one.It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm being a bitch here. It‚Äôs just that I lose all interest in pleasuring someone when the above scenarios happen.

Guys!!! You want good blow jobs. Treat your woman right and wash yo ass!"

dating_advice,fh5hrar,t1_fh5762w,1581289168.0,I have lots of self respect. I make my needs/expectations be known upfront. I don‚Äôt expect others to guess what I need/expect. Saying yes to sex does not mean dating yes to having a sleep over. How about you try doing that instead of playing games and making your partner try and guess? It‚Äôs called emotional maturity.
dating_advice,fh5fp9o,t1_fh5cq32,1581288582.0,"Yes. It is about being decent enough to discuss your expectations upfront. Agreeing to sex does not mean agreeing to spend the whole night together. If that‚Äôs what you need it‚Äôs your responsibility to discuss that upfront. It‚Äôs YOUR responsibility to bring up your own needs/wants/expectations. It‚Äôs not my responsibility to try to guess. It‚Äôs called being emotionally mature.

PS The only reason I brought up gender was because people (idiots) keep assuming I‚Äôm a guy using girls for sex.

Just a little about me for all those making assumptions:

I‚Äôm a pansexual, polyamorous woman.

I have insomnia which makes it very difficult to have sleep overs.

I have never used anyone for sex.

I have had and continue to have, very fulfilling relationships with my partners.

I have enough emotional maturity to...

a) discuss my wants and needs without making people guess

b) realize that people have different wants/needs than I do and do not judge them for thinking or doing things differently than me.

c) realize that if I have a problem with someone‚Äôs expectations, that it means that I should choose should not date them instead of judging or trying to change them."
dating_advice,fh5c249,t1_fh55yl8,1581287378.0,"First off, I‚Äôm a woman and I‚Äôm talking about sleeping with men.  So are you saying:

Not sleeping in bed together after sex=me (a woman) using men for sex????

....I know, it‚Äôs tough to take responsibility for communicating your own wants/needs. If it‚Äôs your expectation to spend the night together because you agree to have sex with someone it‚Äôs your responsibility to discuss that upfront. It‚Äôs not someone else‚Äôs job to guess what your expectations are. It‚Äôs called being emotionally mature enough to communicate your expectations instead of selfishly assuming everyone feels the same way you do. Oh, and being able to accept and respect that someone does things differently in their lives, without placing judgements, is also being emotionally mature."

dating_advice,fh4zuuo,t1_fh4yrok,1581283698.0,"Well, first of all, I get all of the sex I want because I‚Äôm an attractive woman and second, I like relationships. No need to hire a prostitute. I have very healthy and fulfilling relationships, but I do not have sleep overs until it‚Äôs serious because I never get any sleep and it takes me months after someone moves in to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù how to sleep with them in my bed.

It‚Äôs funny how you twisted that!

Having insomnia=I should hire a prostitute.

How about this. I‚Äôll date people who are able to look beyond their selfish expectations and accept that I have sleeping issues? Yeah. That sounds so much better for me..."
dating_advice,fh4y0oz,t1_fh4x9j1,1581283195.0,"Oh. I‚Äôm selfish because I‚Äôm an insomniac that can‚Äôt sleep well when I‚Äôm by myself, let alone, with a stranger? A medical condition makes me a jerk?

No. I‚Äôm not a jerk. You are just so selfish that you think your wants are more important than my needs. Grow up. Mature a little. Learn that people aren‚Äôt jerks just because they have different opinions than you."
