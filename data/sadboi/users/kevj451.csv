relationship_advice,folxnhi,t3_g7x4dx,1587872968.0,"Listen here girl. Fuck all those agents of the dark realms. You don't need those trolls. You're a boss. Idgaf if your 50000lbs or 50lbs you are super awesome, beautiful and cool. Trust me I had this happen to me. I came back from a trip and found out my boyfriend slept with my friend because he needed p****. Literally dumped him so quick. Don't you dare go dying on us. Living and succeeding will destroy these weirdos. I know its f**** painful. But don't you dare end it all over this peon. Remember he coulda had a bad bih... F emm"
Ozark,fo7lpt2,t3_frrsmw,1587580476.0,"Great read, I just feel like I have many people in my life and being bipolar doesn't equal stupid. I get they are trying to portray the impulsive side of things but come on. They made him make stupid choices like he had a low IQ. I know bipolar individuals who are incredibly intelligent yet struggling to cope with bipolar. I know everyone is different but I just wish he wasn't portrayed that way. His reaction to the chaos for me was understandable because it showed he was a deeply compassionate individual. I don't think he had time to come to terms with things really."
selfharm,fo730qf,t3_g4ugcs,1587571351.0,"So sorry you feel this way and are going through this. One day when you leave your state, and you should. You'll find people who slowly make you realize who you are isn't bad. It just is. Also, I know there's more to you. You're whole self isn't just summed up by being gay. I'm sure you're smart, funny, have dreams and goals and so on. I'm sure the content of your character is beautiful. You're in a time of your life where this is your struggle, you have to fight to love YOURSELF. It's hard but not impossible. 

Wishing you the best."

As long as I say, I have no STD""S and I am not a virgin I don't go into details. I don't want to hear it. I'd rather build on something new. He overreacted. Retroactive jealousy is weird and makes no sense at all. But hey, it's happened. I think you definitely deserve some grace. Who cares if you gangbanged or did porn before him. You deserve a guy who cares for you no matter your past. Don't beat yourself up. Move into your future with confidence and just keep being you. Again sorry this happened. YOU WILL FIND LOVE AGAIN:)"
