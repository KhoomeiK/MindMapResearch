EatingDisorders,fr0nwe4,t3_gln41l,1589801949.0,"An abusive voice in your head is exactly what an eating disorder is. I liked to think of it that there were my thoughts then there were my eating disorder thoughts that were like an annoying roommate (but an abusive parent works too). 

It’s good you already recognize your ED thoughts. This took me a while into recovery. My advice is when the thoughts come, think of of them like that. Don’t try to push them out (because the more you try to push them out in my experience the more they came back) but recognize that’s the abusive roommate or boyfriend talking to you. 

Listen to yourself. The side of you that wants to be healthy and treat your body right. From your question it’s obvious you have that voice in you too. We are only given one body. Treat it right. I know easier said than done, but I think I can speak for everyone on this thread when I say we believe in you ❤️ you deserve food ❤️"

With kyleena I had a period where I had my period for about 3 weeks and a hormonal acne breakout, but it’s still soo worth it to me. 

With every pill I tried I would feel out of it, sluggish, and more moody.

With the IUD I feel like myself AND don’t have to worry about having a baby until I’m ready, so the side effects are very worth it for me.

CallHerDaddy,fqpozyu,t3_gk1wss,1589551230.0,"Yes. I think everyone does when they like someone. Both guys and girls. 

It’s kinda funny to learn how much anxiety my boyfriend had when we first started dating cuz he didn’t show it all. 

If you want the Call Her Daddy advice, and what I personally do, instead of the healthy advice...

Whenever I catch feelings and the guy hasn’t asked me to be exclusive, I always try to go on other dates. 

I don’t tell the guy (I wouldn’t lie but I don’t bring it up) and personally I don’t like to sleep with multiple people at once because the thought of getting pregnant and not knowing the dad stresses me out lolol (but if you’re not exclusive and safe no judgement). 

I noticed still seeing what’s out there takes some of the anxiety off and makes me feel less clingy. And the guy can tell you’re not super available which makes them want you more. 

But I know some girls who do this and turn it into a game. I wouldn’t say that’s the best way. Don’t look at it as trying to make him jealous / a game. Look at it as still getting to know other people while getting to know him. Look at it as maybe he’s the one I want to commit to but until I know him better I’ll keep my options open. Works every time. 

And if he ever realizes you’re seeing other people and brings it up to you just say “well I figured that’s what we were doin since you haven’t asked me to be your gf yet”. Don’t say in a mad way or anything just matter of fact. 

Hope that helps 🤷🏼‍♀️"

CallHerDaddy,fq5to3w,t3_ggvba5,1589117164.0,"most 18/19 year old guys aren’t thinking in terms of a serious relationship. Things are different towards the end of college and especially after. But I always recommend going older cuz older guys seem to have a better idea of who they are and what they want in a partner and what they want for their life. 

I had plenty of beautiful super awesome friends in college who had never had a boyfriend. And now they are in very serious relationships. 

At your age I viewed flirting as more of practice for the right one.

SkincareAddiction,fpw2njj,t3_gfwima,1588956195.0,"My skin had been doing great recently. I had hormonal acne in middle school that went away in high school. I am now 26. I got an IUD 2 months ago. Once my period came this month (sorry TMI) I broke out in hormonal acne all over my neck and lower part of my face. 

I have routinely used differin for the last year once or twice per week because that was all I needed to keep acne at bay. For the last week or so I have used it every night, surprisingly with no peeling or anything, but it has barely helped. 

Any advice with hormonal acne?? I really want to keep my IUD because I don’t want a baby right now and tried multiple pills that all made me more emotional and “foggy”. But any tips would be grand."
offmychest,fpri09i,t1_fpqpyik,1588854649.0,"Totally agree with you. When you’ve seen gal friends actually go through that, it’s easy to want to cry out “Believe All Women” because any empathetic, sane person can imagine being the victim of that but can’t imagine lying about having it happen. 

Of course if we just believe all women, there will be people out there who use it to their advantage, which is really sad and wild. Just look at Amber Heard and Johnny Depp. 

I once had to testify for a guy friend against a false accusation. Before that, I always thought you never truly know people and tended  to side with the girl. 

My guy friend and I hung out the whole time at a party because neither of us drank at the time since we were really into fitness. This girl neither of us knew was bragging about taking Xanax and adderall before the party, had one drink, and went totally crazy then passed out. Her friends called 911. My friend offered to carry her out so the stretcher didn’t have to come up the small stairs to the 5th floor and since he was a strong sober guy. 

As soon as they got outside she started screaming he raped her. He put her down and backed away with his hands up explaining to the officers and ambulance he had just met her and offered to carry her down since he’s sober. We figured she was just f***** up and in the morning she would take it back since there’s no way in the minute it took him to get down the stairs, with her friends next to them, he could have done that especially without her friends seeing. 

The next morning she did not drop it, even said he must have drugged her drink, and there was a whole investigation. 

I never thought I would so quickly take a guys side. Yes I would have been shocked because of his character. He was a really great guy who had a really great girlfriend. But I testified because for the 2 hours we were at the party, we were together the whole time. There’s just no way it could have happened and her story also kept changing and didn’t add up. 

Its the biggest F you ever to girls who have actually gone through that. The psychology behind someone who would do that is fascinating. 

Happy OP made it out. Can’t imagine the trust issues that would cause."

relationship_advice,fpnottd,t1_fpnnuwf,1588769184.0,"No judgement at all but have you ever thought that maybe you fell into this because that is the love you’ve always seen? I’d take some time to think about if you want your potential future child witnessing the same things you did in a relationship. 

It’s super natural to fall for the love we saw growing up. I’ve heard that we often fall for people who are like our most problematic parent because subconsciously we want to fix them. It’s all subconscious before but I’ve seen this happen a lot with myself and with friends. But it doesn’t work. it just continues the cycle. I would definitely take some time reflecting on why you’re in this relationship and how it reflects on your childhood. 

I fell into this trap too until I realized I didn’t want my potential future kids to witness the things I did growing up. I fell into the exactly same relationship as my parents. My parents are crazy about each other and super passionate and I never questioned if they loved each other but they fought like crazy, constantly. So many birthdays and holidays were ruined. And I fell into the same thing for years with a man who was so passionate and love bombed me like crazy, and from to the outside world we looked like a “perfect” / “goals” couple. But he would become super abusive. I left and promised myself to only marry a man that I’d be proud to have a son exactly like him, as he is, and who I am confident if we do have a disagreement we need to talk about we have the respect for each other to be able to wait to talk about it where it’s not a screaming match in front of kids. 

Life is is already hard enough to be with someone who makes it harder. It’s crazy the difference to go from someone who really dimmed my goofyness and my personality to my boyfriend now who actually lifts me up and brings out my best me. Life’s too short 🤷🏼‍♀️"

relationship_advice,fplpizr,t1_fpljeyp,1588717018.0,I don’t know. Only she knows so you have to ask her. No point in speculating when you can go to the source. And if she doesn’t want to talk just say something like “I know I can be a real dickhead without even noticing. So just looking for ways to fix it. If you do end up wanting to talk you know where I’ll be.” Not in an angry way or anything. Kinda jokey and lighthearted but still serious if that makes sense.
relationship_advice,fplouur,t1_fpli86a,1588716659.0,"Aww no problem thanks for reading! And feeling like you won’t be loved by anyone else is a typical fear to have in this situation but just know it’s not true. You may be feeling too broken to be with anyone right now, and that’s totally Ok. You will heal. Won’t be today. Won’t be tomorrow. But you will. And you’ll be even better and stronger for it. Having been in an abusive relationship definitely doesn’t put some Scarlett letter on you. Most people have been in one at some point, sadly. You are not alone. One thing that gave me strength was thinking of my potential future kids and how they would see this and think this is love and get into the same cycle. 

The abuse puts you in that mindset of being unloveable (I definitely know it did for me, something I’ve even had to talk to my current boyfriend about). It tears down your confidence and after a while makes you feel like that’s the love you deserve. But it’s not. And that’s not love.

From what you wrote, it sounds like you know what you need to do."
relationship_advice,fpllsrs,t3_ge3wdc,1588715027.0,"I have a very long response to your long question lol. 

No you should not message her sister. 

You sound very genuine. I am not about to say all this to be mean, I am saying this because you seem like you are in a good place to want change and want genuine guidance on the situation. 

It comes across like you did not respect her the whole time. You were never listening to what she wanted, just what you wanted to hear. And the best way to respect her now is to not talk to her. The best way to actually learn a lesson from this is to take the lessons you have learned here and move forward in life. talking to her about how you realized you messed up just shows you really didn’t learn anything. What do you want to talk to her for? So you all can eventually be together? The first few months of a relationship are supposed to be the easiest part and y’all made that rocky the whole way. What’s going to happen when you have actual life stresses like bills and kids when you couldn’t even be stable in the easy parts? And that’s ok! Doesn’t make you a bad person. Doesn’t make her a bad person. There’s a lot of people in this world and only limited time. Time is the one thing you can’t get back so use it wisely. If so early on it’s clearly not meant to be, it’s not rude to stop wasting time. 

Sending you a dick pic of her bf and stuff like that is super weird, but you also showed she could do literally anything to you and you will still be there. Being there no matter what and having no standards for yourself isn’t cute or romantic, it’s desperate and shows you were also not respecting yourself. But honestly respecting yourself is a lesson everyone has to learn and is a part of growing up. So I wouldn’t beat yourself up over it too hard but I would try and learn from it and where that comes from. 

The biggest way you didn’t respect her was by acting out when she said no to being your girlfriend. 1 day or a few days is super fast. Not blaming you for trying. Not blaming you for feeling hurt / rejected. But you gotta understand her side of it too. One day is super quick. 

For some guidance on how to handle that part in the future, when my boyfriend first tried to kiss me, I was in shock and rejected it. We were friends. I knew I found him attractive but had no idea he was into me. I talked it out with him about how my ex had cheated on me a ton and we just broke up recently and I really wasn’t ready to start anything but I do feel super attracted to him. And he just said “not to sound weird but I’m a confident guy and I know what I want. I can’t wait forever but you just come to me when you’re ready.” And you know what he did after that? He left me alone. We’d still see each other with our friends and talk the whole time but he wasn’t texting me all the time or anything. And I thought that was super sexy. He told me exactly where he stood. He had the confidence to tell me he knows he wants me. And he also had the confidence and respect for me to leave me alone. So a few months later I drunk texted him asking if the kiss offer still stood. 

Then like 3 weeks later he asked me to be his girlfriend, and I said no. It killed me to say no but I have some serious fears of feeling “tied down” and figured if we were going to be together some day I should be able to tell him how I’m feeling. And we had a really great long conversation. Totally talked it all out. He was obviously a bit sad but he completely heard me out. I then saw this was someone I could tell anything to. And at the end he said he totally understands but if I ever want him to be my boyfriend I’ll have to ask him. And like a month later I did. 

Now we own a house together and are getting married. And I’m the happiest I’ve ever been and more crazy about him every single day. 

My advice is to work on respect. Respect for yourself, respect for others, and respect for your time."
relationship_advice,fplgcre,t3_ge3wjr,1588712212.0,"I agree with a lot of what everyone else is saying. I talk a ton irl but am not a big texter. Texting just isn’t fun for me. I’d rather hear that soothing voice (lol) or hang out in person. So I wouldn’t be too worried about it. I’ve had a few friends of guys I’ve talked to ask me at a bar or something why I ended things when the whole time I thought the guy ended it, just because I’m that bad at texting. 

But my advice would be to match her. If she’s sticking with one sentence, you can stick with one sentence. And if you think it gets to a good point, ask her if you can call 🤷🏼‍♀️"
relationship_advice,fplfl0m,t3_ge3xld,1588711820.0,"It is scary to walk away from such a long relationship but very worth it. 

I was in a very similar situation. Was with a guy for 8 years since we were 15 years old. Super good looking, loved me a lot, super smart, made a lot of money, the whole “package”. As soon as we moved in together it was like a switch had flipped. He would get mad over anything and everything. I don’t get mad that easily so it was really hard for me to relate to. But I felt like I was walking on eggshells constantly. I’m normally a very goofy person but he totally killed that in me. And the thought of how we would parent together if we ever had kids, terrified me. He proposed, I said no and moved out and it was the best decision I had ever made.

It’s scary but it’s honestly so freeing to be by yourself after an abusive relationship. Once we broke up, I could finally think about what I wanted instead of what I had to do to keep the peace (which still never worked). I ended up buying a one way plane ticket a few months in advanced, getting a 2nd job to save up, and traveled the world because I could. 

And now I just bought a house with the love of my life. I’m with a man who makes me laugh constantly, feel supported, and I can be 100% myself around. If he ever does get angry (which I’ve only seen once and it wasn’t toward me), I listen to him fully because I can trust that if he’s angry there’s a good reason behind it. It’s crazy to look at the guy I’m with now, how happy he makes me, and how if we ever do have kids he will be the best dad ever and we will be the best teammates, and to think I almost missed out on all that because I couldn’t walk away from someone who made my life so much worse. 

I honestly think its typically harder to walk away from an abusive relationship than a healthy relationship. Because with a healthy relationship, you may miss the person but you at least have yourself and know yourself. After an abusive relationship, you’re broken (at least I know I was). I didn’t know me anymore. I didn’t know how to make myself happy anymore. You have to put yourself back together again. Which is way harder than purely just missing someone. 

You’re still so young. We only have one life to live, and life is way too short to spend with someone who makes you feel that way. One day you’ll find someone who effortlessly makes you feel like, and helps you become, the best version of yourself. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this gal :/"
relationship_advice,fpl80fl,t3_ge4633,1588707992.0,"You’re definitely not being overly emotional. Not feeling supported, especially when it’s your body crapping out on you, is definitely something that would make 99.99% of people upset. 

Have you tried talking to him about being there for you? 

May I ask why you all have been off and on? 

 I used to have reoccurring health problems with my kidneys. My long term boyfriend was not very supportive of it. 

Im from the US and 2 years ago (about a year after I broke up with my ex), I got really sick in Portugal. I called the guy I was “dating” (but not boyfriend and girlfriend because I was traveling and he lives in / is from New Zealand) to tell him I had another kidney episode and was being admitted to the hospital so I wanted to let him know in case I didn’t have WiFi at the hospital and couldn’t receive texts. He said ”which hospital are you at? I’m getting on the next plane from New Zealand. See you in 30 hours.” And hung up. And 30 hours later he was there so I didn’t have to be alone in the hospital. I was shocked. He doesn’t have a ton of money and we weren’t even official so I definitely never expected him to do something like that.  My own family didn’t fly over when I was sick and the US is way closer to Portugal than New Zealand (although they were in constant contact with the doctor). 

The reason I’m telling this story is because in every relationship you are going to have times where you don’t feel supported by your partner and need to talk about it. But if you talk about it and he still acts like he doesn’t care / doesn’t support you, it may be better to call it quits. After a relationship that long def better to be alone for a bit to build yourself back up. But once you are, there are supportive guys out there."

HomeImprovement,forql21,t1_foror0s,1588016762.0,Thanks! Do you happen to have a tub as well?
HomeImprovement,foroblx,t1_formr5p,1588015634.0,Thank you!
HomeImprovement,form201,t3_g93wjo,1588014516.0,Well now I’m even more conflicted! Definitely don’t like being cold but also should have added I am claustrophobic (it’s annoying but really can’t help it) so I wanna feel open in the small space but also don’t want a nightmare
HomeImprovement,forlx1q,t1_foretx1,1588014448.0,Second on which one you got! Looking into this now
HomeImprovement,forlh9k,t1_fordsht,1588014235.0,Are you in Virginia??
HomeImprovement,forlg32,t1_forc9yk,1588014219.0,"Apparently the toilet is the most expensive to move in my area! And in my head I like the idea of a separate shower and bath tub. Mostly because my boyfriend likes baths where I prefer showers so it’d be kind of nice to do both at once lol. But if it’d be a nightmare then I can get over that stubborn idea. 

My best friend said the same thing about the toilet. Personally this doesn’t bother me at all either, especially because it’s the bathroom attached to our room and only us living there so I’m not too worried about people busting in on me. But it is something to keep in mine should we decide to sell it in the future. I definitely don’t want to pour money in to hurt the resale value."
HomeImprovement,forkoz6,t1_for72wa,1588013850.0,"Haha thanks! Knew someone was going to comment that. Definitely something to keep in mind when buying a house with someone. We are getting married but pushing it back since all the weddings this year are getting pushed back to next year. And we didn’t want to miss out on the current interest rates. But either way, divorce or breakup, it’d suck to get out of and is a big step. 

Luckily both my boyfriend and my dad are lawyers. So we have a written agreement for what to do in the event we break up and how it will work out that we are both very happy with. If anyone is thinking about buying a house with a boyfriend or girlfriend and wants to know the agreement we came up with I’d be happy to expand on that. 

But yes definitely something to look out for. I shared a lease with a guy a few years ago that was a nightmare to get out of so a mortgage would be even worse. Sorry you had to go through with that."

trump,fora93f,t1_foqu3fd,1588008818.0,"I got a post deleted on the Bernie subreddit asking why I should vote for Bernie in the primaries. No attacking. Not in a “why should I vote for this radical man?!” Just genuinely saying I liked Buttigieg and now he is out so I’m lost for the democratic primaries and why should I vote for him. It got deleted and I got a message about how that was a pro Bernie subreddit so they deleted my post. Like... you can’t even have a nice discussion with someone who is open to your ideas? Just because I’m not fully in? 

I was nervous to make this post admitting to being liberal on the pro trump subreddit so thanks to all the trump supporters who have been nice to me. But I guess that’s the thing with Trump. He’s really not that conservative. He’s the most moderate candidate we’ve had in a while in my opinion. 

I couldn’t support him the first time because he flip flopped so much I didn’t know where he stood or what to expect with him. He could have been moderate or he could have been radically right. It was hard to tell. But now we have a better idea of where he stands. I don’t love everything he has done but he has really impressed me. You all were right haha."

I want to see people stay as safe as possible during all this. None of this feels real. No president could have stopped it 100% from spreading here. Even Nancy Pelosi said in February to still go out and visit your local chinatowns. 

This is a time we need to be standing together. It is totally fine to criticize policy you do not agree with, and to disagree with me. But coming onto a protrump reddit to say I am the cause of the deaths from this is hurtful and ignorant. I am about to go to dental school so have some medical background from that and my job so have been volunteering to assist in emergency surgeries with doctors still working to keep our emergency rooms cleared for COVID patients. Meanwhile you’re going on pro trump Reddits to attack people with different opinion. Why are you on here?"
trump,foqj2ya,t1_fopfkyf,1587994707.0,"Here are some but is there anyway we can chill with the downvotes and if anyone disagrees leave it as a constructive comment to this? I get worried posting my moderate opinions will just piss everyone off. I have my BA in political science and the more I learned about politics, the more I learned I don’t know s***. I have educated opinions, but even the smartest people in the world don’t have all the answers to politics and I know I don’t either. So I welcome other ideas and people who disagree with me but let’s talk about it below. 

For one, I have only voted for democrats so far. I did not vote for president in the last election as I could not decide. But voted for Obama in 2012. And the democrats in my state elections have all been stronger candidates in my opinion. 

I am pro separation of church and state. And am not a fan of how much most republican candidates run and govern based on Christianity. Totally cool to be Christian, but making policy and governing based off religion is not constitutional in my opinion. 

Universal healthcare. I used to live in Portugal and really loved their healthcare system. They have both public and private hospitals which seemed to work really well. Clearly we need an overhaul in the US. I used to have kidney issues when I lived in Europe and realized if it ever happens again it will be less expensive for me to fly to Portugal, rent an apartment for a month, pay for the bills at a private hospital without any insurance, and fly home than it is to receive care in the US with insurance. Which is ridiculous. 

I am for protecting the environment.

I’m pro sex education and pro choice. 

I’m pro capitalism but with some government regulations to keep consumers and workers safe (having regulations are considered liberal). 

I am someone who is really disgusted by racism and judging someone based off the color of their skin or where they came from. 

Pro gay marriage but seems like most people are now and it’s not as much of a liberal vs conservative issue thankfully. 

Pro immigration but I’d say I am probably considered more moderate on this topic now a days because I’m cool with secure borders. I am not someone who is chanting build that wall, but I do think it’s a good idea to have secure borders. I have been to Tijuana and it’s a terrifying place. #1 murder capital in the world (I didn’t know this until after I went, stupid) because one cartel has bought out the police there and another has bought out the military there so it’s like a war zone. And that’s just right across the border from us. If anyone wants me to expand on my experiences in Tijuana I can, as well as other parts of Mexico. But I think the different cultures and immigrants is what makes America America. And am definitely pro immigration. 

Honestly democratic politicians taking such a strong stance against securing our borders has made me question if some of them are being paid by the cartels or something. I have no evidence for this and only thought about it because I have been watching a lot of Ozark in quarantine haha (if you haven’t seen Ozark, highly recommend, people of all political parties can enjoy). But in 2006 many democrats, including Obama voted in favor of building a fence at the border and now all of a sudden a wall is considered super racist? I am in no way attacking Mexicans while saying this. My heart goes out to the people who live there, are trying to raise their family there, and live in fear of the violence. And the people there who want to open a business and make a better life for themselves but are afraid to because the cartels will come by and offer them protection for money (aka pay us or we will kill you). The violence there is very real and not something we can just ignore. But the way immigration is set up in the US now, you have to be rich to do it fully legally. And why would rich people be immigrating here? So definitely want to see policies that makes it easier for people to do it legally while keeping cartels out."
SkincareAddiction,foqckgv,t1_foqavir,1587990154.0,Yes to get the sunscreen off. If I’m not wearing either during this quarantine then I will just wash my face.
trump,foosv7r,t1_foohwxr,1587945745.0,"I agree. But clips in the media will show it the other way around. 

I think that’s what really bothers me with all the Trump hate. Of course, everyone will have different political opinions. If every human thought the same that’d be boring AF. But I come from a very purple state, always knew a lot of liberals and conservatives. 

So it’s fine to disagree with Trumps policies. But to hear people attacking every single person that voted for Trump was upsetting. I would hear people say we should just get rid of the Midwest and middle America because they all voted for Trump and they’re all dumb. It’s like... these are the people who give us our food and our electricity. They’re not dumb people. Sure there are dumb people on the right just like there are dumb people on the left but to grounp everyone together is really ignorant in my opinion (which is ironic since super liberals always boast about not being ignorant). 

Sorry for the long rant lol. Just trying to say I think Trump will definitely win this election. And a big reason is because Democrats think by attacking Trump and showing how bad he is they will win. When really it just removes them from a huge portion of America. The majority of Americans like at least some stuff he is doing. But they will never recognize the good and it’s shooting themselves in the foot. The democratic debates were a joke."

SkincareAddiction,fo4u8fo,t1_fo49dmk,1587511312.0,"Yeah just wanted to add it because even in a humid environment if your skin has more water than the air, HA will take moisture from your skin and evaporate off into the air. And for me even in a humid environment I can’t get it to work. If you’re loving your HA toner then keep using it. I just wanted to add that part because HA has become this HG ingredient. And for a lot of people it is. But recently I’ve heard of a lot of people getting dehydrated from it so it’s just something to look out for! 

1g of HA holds 1000g of water. That’s a lot of water to get from the air and if it doesn’t get it from the air it’ll look to your skin. Again if it’s working that’s awesome. But if you’re getting dehydrated, try a toner without HA and see if it could be that 😊"

EatingDisorders,fnzovvv,t3_g4njpq,1587398122.0,"When I had an eating disorder, my body also bloated super easily. Once I was into recovery for a few months that stopped. The bloating was worse at first but now I almost never bloat. I drink beers and eat a burger and fries and look the same. Maybe this is why you’re bloating? (Just adding the never bloat to encourage recovery).

As for your friend, you’re going to have to distance yourself. My best friend and I would do the same thing. We both had an eating disorder and def were in competition with each other even though we never said it. I moved across the country after college and think this really helped both of us. I know this isn’t usually an option lol but we are how really good friends again and can talk about how messed up we used to be. Sometimes people aren’t good for you right now. Doesn’t mean their not good in general. Just not good for you right now. 

Hope this helps!"

Every 3 days then slowly move up to every other. I’ll only use mine every night if I’m on my period cuz I will break out more then. And make sure to wait 30 min after washing your face to apply it! If your skin is wet at all, the side effects will be worse."

CallHerDaddy,fns9kc2,t3_g3c1tv,1587216507.0,"Ok this is super nerdy but I took a history of sexuality class in college and thought someone in here might find this interesting cuz I didn’t know this... during the 1600s / 1700s people thought women had a way higher sex drive than men. So they needed to be controlled by their fathers or husbands so they wouldn’t go out and try to f*** everything. And the time the female orgasm was most written about in American history besides today was the Puritan times. Because the puritans believed you needed to orgasm to have a baby but also that women would go crazy if they didn’t orgasm. 

Kind of random but I just find it interesting how much the view of our sex drives has changed overtime. So many people say it’s just natural... men have a higher sex drive than women. My dad is super liberal and even he used to tell me I need to be careful cuz guys sex drive is 8x higher but it’s all bull shit. 


It’s mind blowing to me how judge mental people can be towards women during this day in age. But I def think it’s a maturity thing. When I was younger guys would always want to know how many people I had slept with. My boyfriend and I now have never talked about it and never will. Boys get insecure about how many guys a girl has been with. Men don’t give a f*** because they know they’re the one lucky to be with you now, are confident they’re the best and don’t need to think about other guys you’ve been with, know your experiences made you who you are, and they’ve live their life too before they met you.

Ok rant over lol. I’m really sorry that happened to you too with the physical violence :/"

EatingDisorders,fns8p84,t3_g3lcze,1587215858.0,"Yes starving yourself when you’re hungry and trying to throw up are definitely signs of an eating disorder. Also I love your title... that is me with everything lmao. 

And since you said you want to make yourself throw up but can’t, I remember being there. The day I first made myself throw up felt like the happiest day of my life (which is super sad to think about now). I remember thinking this was the answer to all of my weight problems, maybe even life problems in general. I remember thinking now that I could throw up my food I could literally have my cake and eat it too and not get fat. 

This was the start of the worst 5 years of my life. And I actually ended up at a heavier weight during my bulimic times because of all the binging and my body having no idea what a normal amount to eat was. It took years from my body to recover from the abuse. I also had kidney failure in my early 20s... but luckily doctors were able to save my kidneys after months in and out of the hospital. Having an ED sounds glamorous when your brain is in a disordered state. It’s not. And something I would think about too during recovery is how some people can’t even afford to eat and here I am binging and purging on food. It reminds me of that scene from the first hunger games if you’ve seen it lol where people from district 12 are starving but in district 1 they are taking pills to throw up to eat more. 

I recovered 4 years ago and genuinely love my body today. It’s hard to work out when your stomach is messed up from binging and purging all the time. Instead of going down that road, move your body in whatever way you like (yoga, weight lifting, walking, rock climbing, whatever) and eat when your hungry and stop when your not. Making yourself throw up is really not a fun path to go down. But I would def recommend talking to a professional if you can. Sorry to just lecture at ya, I totally understand where you are at and don’t blame you. But I wish someone had me when I was where you’re at now hey if you just treat your body right, itll treat you right back."
MakeupAddiction,fnodfuy,t1_fnn4qbe,1587121377.0,"I realized it’s not on here, I found my HG foundation! favorite now is Pur 4-in-1 Foundation + concealer. I have the shade LG5 but it’s a bit light so will purchase LG6 next time. It’s amazing. It may get a bit more oily than Estée Lauder but it’s so beautiful I don’t even care lol I just use the hyldamide matte 12 on top and it stays all day (and definitely has better staying power than most this list alone). 

This is the first full coverage foundation I have ever used and loved. Usually I steer away from full coverage because it looks cakey but this stuff is so natural looking. Usually if I have a patchy spot on my skin the more I blend the patchiest it looks, but this is the only foundation where I blend out a patchy area and its blended beautifully. Just know a little goes a long way. I can use half a pump on my whole face. 

I noticed all the influencers I’ve seen review this have really liked it. I’m surprised to not hear about it more. You can get it at Ulta but they don’t have all of the 100 shades."
