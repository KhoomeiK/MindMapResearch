I didn’t choose to become suicidal, I didn’t choose to have panic attacks to the point of dry heaving into the garbage can, at that point my choices were to leave the job or drive myself off a bridge on my way home.

relationship_advice,f75fjiw,t1_f73vqi6,1573414608.0,"Thank you for your response. They didn’t know I had specific plans but they knew my partner was coming home to see me (he’s been working out of town for 2 months and I hadn’t seen him for almost 2 weeks, they knew this). 

They did not tell me they were running late, and when I did contact them to see when they were coming they said they were on their way, but it took much longer than the time it would’ve taken to get to my house from where they were.

When I do favours for them I’m always very accommodating even if it’s inconvenient for me because, well they’re my friends and have helped me out in the past but not to the extent I help them. 

They also aren’t the biggest fans of my partner for whatever reason so I think perhaps they didn’t consider that it was important to me to spend time with him.

It’s a tough situation, I think distancing myself from them might be a good plan."
