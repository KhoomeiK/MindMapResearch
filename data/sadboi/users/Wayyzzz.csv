Obviously she can act the same, and be the same personality, but for someone like me who loves lore of everything, including characters, where they are from and culture, etc is important. Making her black changes which region she is from (or her parents etc) which changes her lore in turn. 

I don't think that changing a character like that will mean the new one is instantly bad, or that I will go in hating it, but I will go in dissapointed I won't see the source material I was expecting, but that always happens, but when its done for political reasons I think its awful. 

'''If she is a different race, she must have had a different background than the previous one

Why?''

If you're black, you''re usually black for a reason. People look different for biological reasons, Brown people need more sun that Scandinavians because they're so used to the sun and so on. I take these into consideration when looking at characters in ficiton, if I see someone that is black, I assume their origin is of a country or region that is very hot, meaning not where most of the Witcher takes place in this example. Obviously this is different IRL because of how easy immigration is lol and how much its changed, but the Witcher is heavily inspired by polish folk  lore and the medieval period, and unless explained, its assumed it would be the same. 

I think certain changes will always happen when adopting books into movies / series, and I think a ton are needed for pacing and other things, but when you make a political change it feels like disrespect to the material. Nonetheless I still don't think the actors or the characters have to be bad because they're different, they just wont exactly be what we as the reader were told before."

The witcher world is a fictoinal world but if we're supposed to take it seriously, future adaptions should take the source material seriously.

By changing her race you also change her ethnecity, background and in whole the character. If she is a different race, she must have had a different background than the previous one stated as an example on why race washing is bad. I can see the whole historical accuracy thing not making much sense considering its fantasy, but if its supposed to be a world where its similar to europe where most races lived in their own parts, so asians were mostly in asia, blacks in africa, and then whites in Europe, I think that applies to the Witcher world as well."

English is THE international language, it's the language most spoken when you look at countries that knows it, not individuals. Theres dozens of countries with it as an official language, compared to Mandarin which has less than fucking 10. Of course everyone should know English when so many countries speak it, and it was the last language to basically rule Europe and NA.
