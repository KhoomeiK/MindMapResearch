So each time i shoot up i do a little more then i know my body can handle, just praying i fall asleep and don’t wake up.
My friend called the cops on me because he knew that when I became homeless that id kill myself and me being the manipulative piece of shit i am, i hid from the police until i called them and convinced them I wouldn’t...i mean partly true because I don’t have the balls to follow threw. I pray every day that today will be the day i hang my self, but who am i kidding? I cannot even afford the fucking rope to do it!

Lawyers keep innocent people out of jail and make sure their clients get a fair trial...And by fair trial i mean, so the D.A. Or The Prosecutors doesn’t do anything illegal and sticks by the rules of the court to make sure you get locked up!

Side note: I think we need to review Federal Prosecutors, District Attorney’s, and Federal Court Houses because the “Conviction Rate” on Federal Cases is ^98%...Let me re-write that! The Federal Government wins +98% of its cases against Unites States Citizens each year! Now do you really believe that 98% of those citizens that are found guilty of their crimes and go to Federal Prison are actually GUILTY!? ABSOLUTELY NOT! See the trick the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT uses is some devious tricky...They slap the Defendant with a ridiculous amount of charges (Funny thing about U.S Laws is that we have multiple laws that all mean the same thing but are written slightly differently and then re-worded multiple times), tack on as many as possible for each different charge and then meet with the attorney and defendant and tell him/her that they plan on throwing the book at you if you take it to trial or you can take this “sweet” plea deal we’re offering you this one and only time!
So you can roll the dice at trial and look at anywhere from 20-100 years in the feds or you can plead out now, skip trial and take a 20 year bid. Now regardless if you’re innocent or not, going up against the Federal Government in a trial and face the extremely high chance of losing to a government with a 98% conviction rate and sit in a prison cell the rest of your natural or serve the 20 years offered and be out in time to live the rest of your life? I’m not a betting man but i’m taking the 20 year bid all damn day!

That the only reason he hasn’t committed suicide is because of fate and his friends have always showed up at the right time. That he wouldn’t eat anything at all was because the government gives him $200 a month in food stamps. Yes his disability is hidden in his brain but all those quiet remarks you make while standing behind him digs deep into his psyche...
