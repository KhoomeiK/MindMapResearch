SkincareAddicts,f66yh4r,t3_dpv2tb,1572714969.0,"I used to suffer from hormonal acne as well. I managed to reduced them a lot to about persistent 2/3 pimples each time, which don't bother me tbh. 

I wouldn't use any serum with an active ingredient during the day, unless I was wearing sunscreen. So, if you like to still include those, I'd say apply sunscreen as well, as those make your skin more sensitive to the sun and worsen the hyperpigmentation.

 To help out with whiteheads and blackheads, try out chemical exfoliators, instead of physical exfoliators, with AHA and BHA once or 2x a week. The Ordinary ""vampire"" serum works wonders. 

Make use of masks with bentonite clay, charcoal, matcha, green tea, honey, to help purify your skin and treat acne. GlamGlow has an amazing one, so does Garnier with matcha. 

The peeling from the night moisturiser might be because you are not allowing enough time for the other products to sink into your skin or because they are not compatible. Wait at least 5 minutes before applying your moisturiser. It might help. 

The whiteheads could also be a sign of irritation or accumulation of debris. If chemical exfoliation doesn't help, remove products from your routine and simplify it. Then reintroduce one product at a time to see which one is causing this. 

I hope I helped!"

I had one for many years. I gave up on it 2 years ago because I couldn't fully commit to it. In the end, I was spending a lot money and only getting like 10€ a month from Adsense, 50 if I was lucky. Even if I kept, which technically I did because I didn't delete it, it will only serve as a portfolio to showcase what I can do.  

>I only wish my parents could have covered all my expenses.

That we all wish. But we all want the money to cover a major that we have a passion for. 

>You need to bust your ass after your day job and hustle, it’s not an easy life. 

It's not an easy life indeed. Any ""artistic"" job requires some sort of financial background or luck. Talent is only a small portion of what's needed. How many artists are out there unemployed or working a day job they don't even like? Just because I don't want to risk all and do it, doesn't mean I'm not passionate about it. Passion does not excuse dumb/reckless decisions that will then limit your further down in life. Trust me, life doesn't treat you right just because you are passionate. 

>You need to bust your ass after your day job

A point where we differ is I don't believe hard work takes wherever you want to go. I can tell from experience, by being around my parents's friends and even close family, you can work as hard as you want but if you don't have the means, you won't make it. That's just how life is. And I'm not dumb enough to rely only luck, because there are millions and millions of people that don't make it. 

This frustrates me because I have the means, perhaps even the network, to help me get a higher chance in getting where I want to be. However, I lack the support. I feel like this is where we disagree as well. You feel like as parents, they do not hold the ""duty"" to support you. I disagree, maybe it could be a cultural thing, but where I'm from, the moment you have a child, you do whatever you can to support that child until the end. Which, then becomes an issue, because I don't want to disrespect my parents and disregard all their hardwork they do for me. I'm grateful for everything, but at the same time, just wish I was supported on something I wanted to pursue in life. 

Maybe your parents wanted to stop but didn't because at the end of the day, doing what you love the most for the rest of your life is much more rewarding. And that's what I wish my parents knew."
