 Women have emotional awareness far beyond men. For a man finding his emotions is like digging in the bottom of his toolbox. Their in there somewhere, he's not exactly sure what they look like, or how to handle them. He knows he has them only because they pop up unexpectedly and surprise him. 

Adam was made first so he could figure out that he was alone and needed a partner. Thats a guy thing. We really are that simple.

As you read those stories you will find that the writers of most of them didn't know each other and that the Character of God is consistent. 

It is reasonable that you not understand the ""Christian mission"". IMO most Christians don't understand it either. Christians are weak, hurting people who have found the source of life and strength. It is not hypocritical to tell a person who is looking for life and strength where it can be found. As we learn about ourselves and God our faith and choices do change. Remember we have found the source of life, we want to live, we enjoy life, we aren't going to give it up.

It is human nature to choose what we believe. Our choices feel right to us. 

All those stories you referred to support your contention that God is not lenient. Those stories also support your conclusion that all people deserve hell. Now if you include from those stories that God intervenes for us, you have arrived at the essence of the Gospel. We all deserve to sent as far away for God as is possible (hell). God wants us to be with Him (Heaven). Some of us want to be with Him. God, in Christ, made a way for those who what to be with Him to be with Him. 

The scriptures portray heaven and hell as physical places. Our understanding of what they are may be inaccurate. It may be that they are both the same place but that the difference is us. If someone doesn't like God then to be forced to be in His presence would be terrible beyond our understanding.

Each group assumes that the other is using their standard for emotional placement. 

It seems to me that you are dealing with the two  differing perspectives on the inerrancy of scripture. 

What God intended to say is without error. What the writer wrote can be understood as being without error but with the loss of some accuracy. What we understand the writer to have written may or may not be accurate. We are all in error at some point. What ever that point is will be evidenced in our approach to scripture.

Christians,fplnx4l,t3_gdyjqy,1588716154.0,"It almost sounds like you are trying to use fear to compel repentance. We all know it is love that calls us to repentance. For some, this is definitely the last days. Among that sum will be people who will not practice social distancing. We who are in Christ are no longer under the law that we should serve it. We are in Christ that me might serve Him. Seek the Lord."
Christianity,fpll9xw,t3_ge5wgh,1588714751.0,"I'd say the answer is both and. In all communication their is the message sender the intended message, the form of communication, the noise/environment the message enters, the message that is received and the interpretation of that message by the recipient. 

In the case of the scriptures only the message sender is consistent. The scriptures represent the form of the communication and some of the environment. 

Your question appears to be proposing a dilemma that failes to incorporate the character of communication."

I know that with cigs its just the first couple of puffs that give you the hit. If you can put the thing out after the hit you can start to cut back. I also know that on avg. It takes 30 tries before you can quit. 

Do you have any one that you vap with that you can quit within?

It might be worth asking your Dad if his stand on vaping means that if you came to him with a problem that he wouldn't help you. You could state it as ""it feels like you're telling me...."" It could be that he wanted to keep you from vaping not punish you for honesty. If he understands he is keeping you from getting help he might back down. If not you might want to ask him where he thinks you could go. 

If he doesn't know you're vaping its probably because he doesn't want to know. If/when he ""finds out "" what is he going to do? If he doesn't want to through you out he can choose to not find out.

Can you get nicotine patches?"

Christianity,fphvloj,t3_gdin74,1588628622.0,"I appreciate your fear and anxiety. Neather of them are good long term motivation. 

Your feelings are a legitimate response to a real  danger. At some point we will all face the one who made us and this place. We can meet Him as friend or enemy. Its our choice. 

If you have a bible app you will find a book in it that was written to the Romans.  The stuff in that book is relevant to your situation. You will find it helpful to read it and discuss it with your girlfriend. She sounds like an intelligent and interesting woman. You want to talk to her about how the things written in Romans make you feel. You want to find how it makes her feel. 

If you decide to break up with her you are going to feel torn apart. It will take at least 3 years for you to heal. She has already committed herself to you. If you commit yourself to her it will reduce both your fear and anxiety. She has been  a help to you. It sounds like she is willing to continue to help you. Not all women are like that."
Christianity,fphsapm,t3_gdiodf,1588626891.0,"Get him to talk about his feelings. Find out the origin of them. 

Does your church have small group bible studies? How does he feel about you attending a ladies study? How does he feel about you reading bible stories to your children? How does  he feel about being part of a small group that will discuss or study a subject he chooses? How would he feel about you having friends over for coffee once a week? If those friends talk about bible stuff how would he feel?

Many churches have small group ministries that can adapt themselves to your situation. You don't have to go to church if church comes to you."

Christianity,fpfi0j2,t3_gd5j3b,1588571840.0,"It's a good desire. You want a guy who is man enough to make a commitment. Good call.

 OLD is a meat market, not a meet market. ;-) The guy you want is probably a friend of a friend or a friend of a relative. Us old people love to meddle. Tell your friends to tell their parents and grandparents that you are looking for a husband. It won't take them long to find any number of guys who are not players, share your faith and anything else you want to add to the list. 

My 2 cents. The guy will talk to you about his feelings. He will be interested in your feelings. You will be able to laugh together.

If only I had been this smart when I was your age. ;-)"

We also know that antidepressants can suppress creativity. I'm just saying what you are doing doesn't sound stupid at all. Go for it.
Christian,fpfe9ss,t3_gd4euc,1588568710.0,"I appreciate that you are hurting. You have a right to be angry. The way you were treated was wrong on several levels. The church is not free of people who do nasty things. When we encounter people like this we need to limit the amount of damage they do. When we can keep from reliving the experience over and over again we do well. Forgiveness is something God does with us to limit the damage and to bring good fruit from the fertilizer that comes our way. When I remember the evil that others have put on me, I have to repeatedly remind my self that I am forgiving that person. We can forgive because we are forgiven. Guys like this don't deserve forgiveness, but unforgiveness doesn't hurt them it hurts us. It also gets in the way of our relationship with God. 

This guy chooses to disrespect people because it gives him something. Such people are to be pitied.  It is possible that one day he may grow up and become repentant for his choices. Until that day comes you do well to limit your vulnerability to him. God wants us to be reconciled to each other. Reconciliation is only possible following repentance. The unrepentant choose to be pathetic and there is nothing we can do about it.

You are wise to be cautious in dating. The guy you are looking for takes responsibility for his choices. He also is interested in your feelings. He will share his feelings with you. (Warning, young men can be really slow at figuring out what they feel.) Seek the Lord. Be curious."
