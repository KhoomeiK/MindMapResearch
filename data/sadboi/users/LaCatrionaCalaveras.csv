AA, no alcohol in the house, avoiding places where it's present, talking through cravings with a support person.. I even tried to exchange it for weed. Didn't work. I don't want to drink, I have no intention of drinking, and then suddenly as though my body has been hijacked, I'll be getting my hands on some and I've already poured myself some and am drinking. I'm not fully conscious of the process, it's like I dissociate to an extreme point during procurement all the way up to drinking.

I don't take medication. I'm hyper sensitive to psychiatric medication, and in general my body tends to experience the rare side effects of just about all pharmaceuticals. I went through 10 different medications, reacting poorly to all of them, before one doctor finally suggested I don't consistently take anything, only certain ones as needed to function. 

I have Kaiser. Therapy there is a joke. They try to push you off into groups that are absolutely useless if you already know anything about your condition, they're basically 101 classes with no individual focus. I was even told that because I can stop drinking completely for weeks to months before I start back up again, then I'm not technically an alcoholic and therefore I shouldn't be in the addiction department of therapy. Over my 16 or so years of trying to find a doctor that can actually help me, I've only found two and they both were at the tail end of career transition so I only saw them for 3 months before they left. 

I don't drown, I don't throw pity parties for myself, I don't loathe myself. Like I said I'm frustrated and disappointed that nothing has helped me and I don't know what to try next.

And no, ""wanting it bad enough"" doesn't just fix it for me or make it easier. That's actually a very toxic suggestion that can lead people into a spiral when it fails to help them, they begin to question themselves heavily and often relapse. There is no One Size Fits All solution to addiction.
