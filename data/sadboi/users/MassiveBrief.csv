I'm not ungrateful either, but I hate money. I refuse to be a slave to it. There's always pressure. Craptastic demented perverts get high praise and worship just because they have a lot of money. I'll probably end up starving to death because there's no way I could do some of the things some people do to get money. This world is shit to me and trying to upsell shit doesn't work on me."
