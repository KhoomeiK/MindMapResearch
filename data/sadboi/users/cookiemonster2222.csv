And its not just fucking fodder, think about it dude...

It does have everything to do with the topic. Evolution would've eliminated unnecessary mutations bcuz  ""survival of the fittest"".

But anyway, if half of our hand was unusable, eventually it would go away because it makes more complications, it'd be unnecessary etc. right? 

&#x200B;

No one likes to carry dead weight. And in nature, it's a matter of life vs death. 

&#x200B;

Women literally die giving birth, that's how painful & damaging it can be. The smaller the size of the baby, easier the process. 

&#x200B;

Thats why if our brains were only 10% necessary, evolution would've gotten rid of it a long time ago."

[It is also highly unlikely that a brain with so much redundant matter would have evolved in the first place; given the historical risk of death in childbirth associated with the large brain size (and therefore skull size) of humans, there would be a strong selection pressure against such a large brain size if only 10 percent was actually in use.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_the_brain_myth#Analysis)"

Idgaf if u been to college or not, I mean if u did I would expect u to be more educated on racism and socio-economic issues


Also if u think ur only right bcuz u have been to college, yikes get a grip u insecure fucktard

Imagine basing ur whole credibility over 1 signal achievement (an achievement that tons of other ppl, smart or stupid, have gained) 

College isn't even anything to be THAT proud of anymore given the fact dumbass rapists like trump has passed through. But that's a topic for another time.

1.) I thinks it's funny u go thru my profile n bring up irrelevant shit (again!) 

2.) I guess u realize u have no real points left to make so u had to resort to defamation tactics 

3.) Even ur research skills r fucking garbage if u concluded that I still live in India. I mentioned tons of time throughout this Reddit account, I've moved haha 



Also hs or not, I'm old enough to vote so again where I'm at in my point of life isn't relevant to ur bullshit statements 


Go back to college n maybe take a few social studies courses"

But fuck am I tired of having to explain every fucking time to racist dipshits that hyperboles aren't meant to be taken literally.


When women say ""ugh men""

And then these fucks respond ""nOt aLl mEn""


Like yeah fucking obviously

How stupid must u be to have this be explained to u


It's well known by now Republicans/Racists don't really care to be open-minded or learn, they just like arguing with semantics and nitpicking till u lose ur fucking mind

For those who didn't read the short article:

* They think they was planning to hurt but they don't know for sure
* it was a police chase too so he must've been going fast speeds

Not much other info, wondering ~~if it's cuz of psychosis, deranged mentality, or bcuz substance misuse~~   y this happened, as other ppl have assumed, its most likely just another racist alt-right piece of shit (but if not that, then the most likely other reasons r extreme state of mind or substance misuse)

Lemme just quickly clarify:

1.) As u/spaghettilee2112 kindly pointed out (thx again btw):

[""Wondering if"" =/= blaming.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/gf8lm8/gunwaving_suv_driver_crashes_parade_celebrating/fpsldol?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

[""The problem becomes when white people commit terrorism, it's mental illness but when brown people do it, it's terrorism. But nobody was doing that here. The person you responded to also added substance abuse.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/gf8lm8/gunwaving_suv_driver_crashes_parade_celebrating/fpsldol?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

&#x200B;

I was just guessing the most likely possibilities, not making any official statements.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2.) The article didn't state the suspect's race ~~or gender~~, so the whole ""media labeling races unfairly"" issue is not only irrelevant (as of now), but I AGREE WITH IT. 

&#x200B;

**I been well aware of that issue for years, stop tryna lecture me on shit that I didn't say üôÑ**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3.) Yes he's most likely a nazi alt-right trump-supporting racist piece of shit, which is why I fucking added ""deranged mentality""

&#x200B;

guess I should've been more specific but yall r wasting ur energy on the wrong person

Edit 2: [I did not mean to imply this is a 1-off situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/gf8lm8/gunwaving_suv_driver_crashes_parade_celebrating/fpst2uw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) or that the alt-right white supremacist terrorist acts arent a serious issue, the article didn't mention his name, race, or motivations so I just chose the first label that popped up in my head, my b"
