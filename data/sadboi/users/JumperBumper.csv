I have to say though, I think she'll need to bottom out before she'll change. It probably isn't going to be pretty.

Read up on relationships with people with bipolar disorder. I've read that both partners need to take responsibility for what is their illness, not just one person. That probably means taking the meds.

My advice for people not taking their meds is that you're going to waste a huge amount of your life due to instability if you don't take them. At least try then for a couple of years. It is easier functioning on them than off. Once your stable, you'll make better choices about how to change meds. But you need to get stable first.

I've had my psychiatrists saying that CBT isn't as effective as other treatments, I've had psychologist telling me that CBT isn't as effective as other treatments. I've heard other people (anecdotally) talking about how CBT isn't as effective as other treatments, and also their psychiatrist saying the same.

Again, for me, CBT doesn't really work as well as medication for intrusive thoughts that I get with bipolar disorder. I don't suffer from hallucinations, or delusions, but I still get intrusive thoughts. These thoughts are not the same as OCD that you brought up in the original point. The whole point of my original point was to separate the treatment of OCD intrusive thoughts from bipolar intrusive thoughts, and pointing out that CBT is better for OCD than it is from bipolar; if you want to bounce around Google Scholar, I'm sure you'll find this to be true.

I'm more likely to listen to a psychiatrist on treatments for bipolar disorder than someone that I've met online. Maybe you are a psychiatrist, I don't know, but even then I feel that you're really pushing one treatment above all others. And to be honest, it sounds to me like you're maybe cherry picking your results.

Think about hallucinations, or hearing voices, or delusions. You can't think these things away. Most of the time with the illness, medication is the only way to get away from the intrusive thoughts.

That doesn't mean that it can't alleviate the symptoms, but for treating acute intrusive thoughts, I think going for treatments that have been shown to be more effective is a better a starting point.

Having said that, I find mindfulness more effective than CBT, and I know other folk don't find mindfulness helpful. I also find journaling much more effective than CBT.

There's more than one way out of a low, but stopping meds does another thing: it makes us unstable. Now, think about friends you've lost when you're manic, about people that you've hurt. Think about how it feels when you come out of it again and life feels like it is in a ruin. There are always ways to mend relationships, but not taking the pills is going to set your life back.

Every low will pass with time; whether we're on our meds or off them. I never remember the good times when I'm in a low; that's the problem with it. I just feel like I'm never getting out of it, that the low has lasted for ever. It is, however, a lie.

Taking meds irregularly is worse for us than not taking them at all, it'll make us more low, or more high. If you don't like them, please, take at least half of them until you're back down on the ground again? Just until you're at least stable; fuck how it feels."

One thing definitely not to do is talk about then to your co-workers. Like you say, you're not an expert, and talking as though you are because your girlfriend has it, doesn't mean that you are right.

Don't treat them as though they have bipolar disorder. Ask them what they want done. If something doesn't make sense ask them more about it.

We're all lucid and if we know how to cope with the illness well know when we are being unreasonable. Maybe not at first, but afterwards.

I've just left a job because they decided to cut me of something after I explicitly told them that they need to include me in the conversation if it is something to do with my health. They said they kept me out of it because I was ill, when I was perfectly capable of managing. That's one type of discrimination against people with mental health issues.

I appreciate you wanting to do well, but personally, I've had enough of do gooders for a while. I guess that's the warning out the way so you can see it from their / our perspective ;)

If the work is getting done, and there aren't any real issues, then what does it matter how they behave? Not a danger to themselves or anyone else (this doesn't include disagreements that might happen in any office environment).

Questions I have though:

* How long has this been going on?
* Do they live by themselves?
* Do they have people that they talk to out of work?

There is no harm in being aware of what is going on. If there is actually an issue, talk to them about the issue, not the Illness. Then you are at least treating them like a person"

Touche!

> Telling him to bottle up the conflict, imho, is terrible advice.

For me, and I'm guessing for ***some*** other people, giving the cash back would be worse; I'm completely serious when I say this. The only way out of internal conflict for me is forgiving myself for my mistakes. Needing to have other people forgive you is problematic because some people are just nasty.

In my life, my ability to forgive myself and other people is what keeps me stable and able to work. Doing nice things for other people doesn't help my mental health; it feels more of a quick fix. It took me a long time to realise how I needed to forgive myself for my mistakes, and other people for theirs. By doing so, I no longer needed someone else to validate my existence. I am enough. When I'm down, or low, that isn't always the case. But most of the time now: I am good enough.

There are people that I care about that I would apologise to. There are people whose opinion does not matter that I would not apologise to, with some caveats:

* The mistake wasn't discovered; IMO don't dredge up the past, you're asking for trouble
* I care about the person that I slighted
* I was not doing something to hurt someone else; I was doing it for a good reason, but it turned out that it didn't benefit someone else

In the last instance, I'd probably want to talk to them and let them know why I did what I did, and to understand why they were upset by what I did. But I wouldn't apologise, or beg forgiveness, I'd try to find a good solution for the future instead.

One of the issues with depression is that your memory isn't that good, so you can't remember how you felt a week or a month ago. Use the dalio app for a few months before you change anything. Once you cut back, keep using saloon so you can see patterns in your mood without then. This is important in order to be objective. You can also use patrerns that you see to justify things to your psychiatrist.

The meds aren't there you make you feel a particular way, they are there for stability, and it is the stability that you will be giving up.

There are some peculiar effects of you stop your meds as well. How you feel without your meds won't be apparent for a couple of months. Same as when you go on them.

Some meds you need to be careful with. An example I've heard about is skipping taking lamotrigine in the morning has a worse effect on stability than not taking it at all. Other meds are the same when the dose is too low. You really need to do this with the guidance of your psychiatrist.

If you want to do it, tell your psychiatrist that you are doing it with or without their help. They need to be working with you not ignoring you. ""I feel like you are ignoring me."", ""This is my life"". Write down what you want to t ll them before you go.

I do my best to be nice to everyone, and to be chatty. But there are always one or two narcissists around that spread gossip about me so that they've got something to talk about.

Gossip always happens the same way with these folk. First the gossip, then the being nasty to me, then other people see me react and read too much into what is going on, then they join in on the bullying. Classic example was when I was volunteering at a local store, the manager spread gossip about me and everyone in the shop avoided me. I had done nothing to anyone. Eventually the same manager told a guy with learning difficulties that it was his fault that they weren't going to have a Christmas meal the at year because the manager couldn't take time off to buy food, because the guy needed to take his gran to hospital.

The thing with being a little different is that folk don't have as much patience for you. And that isn't our fault. We have just as much right to live and be ourselves as anyone else. The bullying and harassment is wrong. The same way that gay people have been persecuted for years, we are still persecuted. There is less of it now, but it is not our fault.

I forgive everyone, I help more people thab try to help me. I don't resent it, I know what the current situation is in the world and I know that I am just misunderstood. When someone is having difficulty being around me, I give them space. When someone is having an difficulty with something else, I try to gently support them.

Everyone has their flaws, and if it wasn't me, it would be the next strangest person in the given situation getting the same harassment. Because I can take it better than others, I can improve the environment better than them.

Things like theraputic dose and half life are important. With lamotrigine, I cut back on the morning dose for years, but it turns out if you only take the morning dose, then it will actually make you more unstable, not less. You need to talk to the doctor before you do anything.

Secondly, I work as a software developer and I've got similar things happening with me. The way that I deal with it is to take detailed logs. I can always go back and see where I was if there's an issue.

If you're struggling to remember things, one thing I do is 'splat' down enough so that I can come back and remember what I was trying to talk about, then come back later and fix it. Generally it saves me time, because if I keep trying to remember a particular word, it will distract me from getting the meat of the work completed.

I didn't use to work like this, but because of it, I think I actually perform better now. One positive thing about having memory issues, is that you can approach a problem from two different angles much more easily, because you can't quite remember how you were wanting to do it the first time.

With keeping detailed logs and notes, I've got a 'splat' log, but then when I work out or find something important, I'll either make a more structured note, or create a TODO."

Take notes to take to your doctor. Use the dalio app to try to record your moods, this might be an isolated spike which is fine, but if it is part of a bigger picture then it might be more of a problem.

Would you end up being labelled? Would folk alienate you because of it?

I think instead of social media, I'd try get it published somewhere under an assumed pen name; or find some way to get the message across.

Failing that, restrict who you send it out to to folk that you trust. Then let then be the ones to talk about it to other people with the old, ""I've got a friend with bipolar disorder, and they said...""

If you restrict the audience, and let he audience know that they have been hand picked, you can choose only those that you know can empathise, leaving out narcissists, gossips, and folk that are going to use it as a weapon.

I feel sorry for anyone that chooses hate over a chance to learn something about someone else, about new cultures, and ways of living that might work better for them.

Maybe I am crazy, maybe I am deluded; maybe believing I have superpowers makes them real ;)

I think for us, especially, forgiveness is a tool that can make the difference between managing and thriving. Forgiveness isn't about them, it is us letting go of the anger that threatens to consume us. When we can do that, we can get out of he darkness and find hope again.
