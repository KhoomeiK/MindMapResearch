UnusAnnus,fnayw7b,t3_g02vjz,1586806255.0,"My scary story happened almost a year ago.

I've known a kid from my school for five years, named Christopher Blanchard. We always hung out together after school. We'd watch netflix, disney +, youtube, and even markiplier makes. (this was before unus annus came out)

Chris and I were good friends, he reminded me of myself when I was younger. When we hung out, we always hung out at my house. I didnt know much about his life at home until one day he told me he didn't want to go back becuase his parents were aways arguing. 

Eventually, Chris had to go home, because it was a school night and he couldn't stay over at my house. The next day at school, I asked my counselor if he could check in on Chris.

Oddly enough, my counselor spoke to the wrong Chris. So I asked my counselor if he could speak to Christopher Blanchard, and my counselor told me there was no one at my school named that. I think I was sleep deprived but still it was scary he's not real."
