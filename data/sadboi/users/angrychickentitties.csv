My favorite comment recently was when an OP asked me to clarify some things i said in a reply. They disagreed with a lot of my thoughtfulness but wanted to hear me out anyway. It was a beneficial interaction bc both made the effort to consider what was being said, instead of on proving our point or pushing it. It can't always be like that, but it was truly rewarding.

 I think the voice should be used to add dimension to her character though. In a couple episodes I've seen the posh accent disappear and it immediately made me more curious about who she is. The voice is in line with the facade she upholds but shouldn't cross over to her true feelings. They should play around with it more

I wonder if she'll have a break down, if we'll ever explore the core of Jessica Whitley. I can imagine her nailing some impeccable, emotional moments, like i think she's capable of winning an award if tgey utilise her talents properly.

I think there needs to be some changes in writing and definitely directing."
ProdigalSon,fpbqfgk,t3_gc0ci5,1588476149.0,"Well, a little yes. Here's my pompous, basic ass attempt at a criticism:

The ballet episode for me was so bad i almost got put off the show. By then it started to feel like it lost it's flow. The first half of the season is interesting and suspenseful. (Who knew about that mother complex thing,) The episodes that follwed the ballet one restore some faith. But the suspense for me is... Well I'd like to know where the thrill of the mystery got to.. Was along for the ride, but wonder how the writers are going to pull off the next season.. 

This season maybe felt rushed? Like 3 seasons worth of story got squished into 1. 

I found myself wanting for more misdirection and development with many of the characters and their relationships within the story. 

 As well as dimension, for example:

Malcolm being *too* good at negotiation.

 I'd like him to express himself more uniquely with each perp. When Tom Payne goes dark, it gets interesting, it really shows his range. But Malcolm can be placid and monotonous (is that the right word?) in much of the various scenarios. 

Dani taking charge. 
It was a breath of fresh air bc she hasn't been given enough lines or opportunities to grow imo. Her and Malcolm are meant to be close, yet it was so quick so it's hard to believe how they are so close. 

Jessica toning down the posh voice. She does a little, but i wish more often, in order to display certain affect. I did like how at one point it was hard to tell if she was a manipulative mastermind or not.. (Bellamy Young can be an enjoyable actress, she was an edgy surgical boss in Scrubs did yannow lol) 

That's some nit picky shit, but i guess it's bc i really, REALLY want the shows premise  to work. It created it's own niche, but i am of the mind that that niche isn't being expressed as well as it should be. I don't know if it's bc i felt the episodes started waning for me and the ballet episode iced the cake.. But it definitely shades my opinion with cynicism. I'll admit my expectations are a tad high and i compare this show to Elementary which is my favorite. But that's how good i believe this show can be."

AskWomen,flt207a,t3_fqovh8,1585456891.0,"Well i have done both shave and cut my hair off but it was to feel free more than start fresh. 

Always wanted side shaves so did that first and it was liberating AF. To follow through with something i wasn't previously brave enough to pull off, made me really happy. 

Then i preferred one side instead of both and have maintained it since to feel a bit more feminine.

Until recently.. When i decided to cut my long curly hair just past my shoulders up to my ears..

Had wanted it short for a long time but was critical of looking even less feminine. It was a disaster, it brought on a panick and I felt and looked stupid and desperate. 

Every hairdresser who has touched my hair has fucked it up using straight-hair techniques and CLAIMING they know how to cut curls, plus am very cheap and apprehensive about spending unless i really want something. 

After screwing my cut up that bad there was no other choice but to visit a pro and so i borrowed some money and was lucky to get an appt next day. 

And this chick delivered! 

She gave me the exact cut i had envisioned. Kind of like a flappers/ 90's cut. Short at the back with an asymmetric fringe to the right. And i still look feminine. In fact i felt so pretty for the first time in years, she boosted my morale so high, it was kind of the best mistake ever :) 

But fair warning:

She was going to let me walk out of the shop twice before the haircut was real clean/ proper professional. (The back basically looked like a farm of mini black sea anenomes) 

Sooo, #1 tip:
Don't let pro's guilt you into taking what they give you. 

Especially if you struggle socially or mentally AND super-especially if they seem nice. Take someone with maybe. 
(Not an excuse to be a bossy/ fussy b***h tho.) Just another interaction to learn from for me, but didn't buy her chocs n flowers bc of that.

So in order to cultivate a positive inner dialogue, I've been doing, what can be called, 'Changing the tape' (in your mind) using new advice from that article. 

Apparently if the affirmations aren't ligned up with what the person innermost values; and they also feel forced/insincere to repeat; the affirmations can seem shallow/ hopeless, therefore pointless.

 Tbh, i don't much like compliments.. Plus am not a ""I am good/great"" type of gal..

For example.. One (unkind) habit of mine, is to look in the mirror blankly after a shower and deny what is there/ hate it, or both.. And i usually scold myself for being so vain. It's autopilot; part of the after shower routine. It only became exposed when i reminded myself of my values and what makes me lucky in this life. (Changing the tape.) No fighting with, no feeding into, no scolding, just switching the neggy tape to my values one. 

""Its awesome to be able to shower here when i could be in a freezing river."" ""I feel good that i get to care for animals.. remember how that Capibarra is friends with everyone."" ""Remember how gou recorded how awesome so many things are and how much you still value in case you forgot"" *pushes play. 

The sensation of lightness, feeling of calmness and the absence of self loathing thoughts afterwards, was remarkable. I could still look into the mirror, but there was no judgment or disgust or whatever. It was weird..

But really, REALLY nice. 

This is a long, maybe intense, story about something so simple. But not having a healthy inner world can just lead to a life of torture really, that's why I'm all about it. 
It's not for sure things will get that bad, it's just all too common. I'd like to see more people enjoy life without feeling trapped, in denial, self loathing or confused about their worth. 

The other things im trying to cultivate are:

Put emotional literacy into action. 

Improve my behaviour and try to be more pleasant to people so that they feel good even if i dont. 

Letting go of some control, ie. No more scolding self for non-control; surrender a bit. 

Not letting others sway my decisions or impose doubt. Ie. Remember to have faith that the future might actually go well even if i choose wrong. 

Repeat empowering mantras in my head (It IS a better day, there is ALWAYS a way) or really funny scenes/ quotes (""Tamp down your titties Patricia"" - Milly from Hunters lol) 

Really seeing things for what they are and accepting when I'm angry at myself. Some situations or people can make life feel like a trap, but it's an illusion, even when it's true. 

Sometimes you can be lucky enough that someone comes into your life or a situation happens at the right time, or you alreafy have friends and family that aren't toxic, which also helps :) 

Oh and heal and empower self from toxic people. The hardest bit is putting my own needs first. But I've made enough mistakes/ deviated from my choices enough to learn that i can trust myself.
Toxic people drain energy by hijacking your tape player.. Until you catch it and switch it out. 

Lastly, getting to know myself and honoring that. 
Apparently there's more to knowing yourself than just knowing your own flaws and tastes. You're also comprised of limits and values too. Exploring that will be new and positive growth me thinks.

If it makes you feel better, where's the problem in taking a test together when you feel the relationship is leading up to something more intimate? Sounds mature in this day and age. 

But for acute sexy time with a temp, maybe it's not such a bad idea to start releasing home STD kits, like a pregnancy test"

In my troubled teens, after finding out i was positive for chlamydia, i still tracked down the 3 dudes i slept with before diagnosis and told 'em. (It was not a foursome, calm down.) 

So guys as well, test your testes and get a prod in your peepee, it's better than staying infected!

Many gurus and shamans guide people to this very place so that the person may access their whole humanity.

I like Sadhguru, he's real talk if you're ever interested. He has a few videos on YouTube about this very thing.. It's about learning to integrate and exercise silence for your growth as a person by yourself (soul) and a person contributing to the world.

I didn't actually click that this is body language for rejection. For some reason i thought it meant leading him on.. Bc she looks like she'll just barely tolerate him instead of leaving. 

Is that.. A Minister!? MF is gripping her side boob, what a creep! Ariana isn't one to back down from shit like this either, hope he got dealt to, unacceptable!

Is Prince Charles annoyed? Like he's ready to put his cuffs up?

I think Hayden is doing a good job of hiding some anxiety? She's leaning her less vulnerable parts in, and protecting the rest with her hands. (Have been a girl in an anxious situation once or twice) Trying to be considerate without being too vulnerable/suggestive maybe?"

It's like learning how to play guitar or getting good at playing a sport.. Repeated effort and failure over time, equals less effort and less failure over less time to succeed :)

It's the friggen emotions though that make it gruelling though eh. Eventually the shitty stuff like overbearing feelings & self beatings will occur less frequently, and more mercy and self acceptance will come through.

Ie. SOME untrustworthy people can use this kind of rapport to lead people on. 

Most rapport is not deliberate or to one's detriment, but I'd be wary if you don't have a good feeling about someone and they mirror you, like if it feels out of place or inorganic or they're shady or something. Just to be clear, MOST rapport is natural.. However I'm not exactly sure on when it's inappropriate."

But i mean if you're creating drama and really causing distress to a person or hurting the persons life for a shitty giggle or some 'entertainment', that's actually something a bit more messed up than you might be aware of.. Something messed up about you to be precise.. You do know that's not okay? 

 Bad people going batshit is understandably funny on occasion, but people with challenges out of their control or who are being messed with to the point of distress.. That is so far from funny.. You know that's when the shows over right; to start feeling bad?

I'm here having a go bc i can't seem to let it go, ffs. Just want to go somewhere and nobody says shit.. They just silently judge me without making it my business to know. 

You might like this tea.. I was so bothered that the next store i walked into, i caught a staff lady scoping me out and asked her loudly what the hell she was staring at.

You know whose the worst though.. Adults who pretend to be like children! Or who treat children as threats. Immature and almost soulless. 

I've seen beautiful human natures, it just super pisses me off how much more present bullshitters and takers seem to be. I hate how they make me forget beauty, it makes me feel well, worthless. 

 Tbh it's a bit more personal for me, but my god it makes it hard to like humanity when so many won't exercise it.

The term c*ck worshipper goes with women who have high tolerance and leniance for men, but don't share the same standards when dealing with females. 

In other words, they defend the guy every time, even at the expense of another lady's safety or wellbeing. Or they let males get away with murder but are more likely to punish, or not give the same understanding with other females.
 
It's basically also the condition of being ""whipped/whooped"" or maybe just more gender bias in a toxic way? 

What is it like to have an absence of sexual attraction? I used to be okay with it, but recently it's been bothering me. When it wasn't an issue, i had less to worry about and felt more comfortable in the daily world. I also felt less lonely. Have you always been more asexual?"
