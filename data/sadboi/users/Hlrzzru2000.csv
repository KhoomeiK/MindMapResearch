 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna give you the tough love that I wish someone had given to me when I was 17;

Enjoying your ups will ultimately ruin you and hurt every relationship you have.

You have the choice to be on meds. It‚Äôs a PRIVILEGE. 

Being stable seems ‚Äúboring‚Äù but let me tell you: 
It‚Äôs foolish to trade your quality of life and your future for a minuscule amount of manic pleasure.

Do better than me and be smarter than me and take your meds. And every time you take them, you can grieve a little. You can miss the life that you‚Äôll never know; the one where you don‚Äôt need meds and where you get to go on with your life just like ‚Äúeveryone else.‚Äù 

Meds aren‚Äôt your enemy and they don‚Äôt exist to make you be like ‚Äúother people‚Äù 

Meds are meant to bridge the gap- the gap between your instability and who you‚Äôre meant to be. 

Meds will correct your brain chemistry and you‚Äôll become a better version of yourself then you ever could‚Äôve imagined. You‚Äôll achieve things that seem impossible to you in instability.

A year from now, you‚Äôll look back and thank yourself.

You‚Äôll thank your past self for making tough decisions and for sacrificing comfort temporarily so that you could get to a stable place.
