 “I’m gonna give you the tough love that I wish someone had given to me when I was 17;

Enjoying your ups will ultimately ruin you and hurt every relationship you have.

You have the choice to be on meds. It’s a PRIVILEGE. 

Being stable seems “boring” but let me tell you: 
It’s foolish to trade your quality of life and your future for a minuscule amount of manic pleasure.

Do better than me and be smarter than me and take your meds. And every time you take them, you can grieve a little. You can miss the life that you’ll never know; the one where you don’t need meds and where you get to go on with your life just like “everyone else.” 

Meds aren’t your enemy and they don’t exist to make you be like “other people” 

Meds are meant to bridge the gap- the gap between your instability and who you’re meant to be. 

Meds will correct your brain chemistry and you’ll become a better version of yourself then you ever could’ve imagined. You’ll achieve things that seem impossible to you in instability.

A year from now, you’ll look back and thank yourself.

You’ll thank your past self for making tough decisions and for sacrificing comfort temporarily so that you could get to a stable place.

Your future self will thank you.”"
