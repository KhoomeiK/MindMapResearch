LeftWingMaleAdvocates,fpkxmw7,t3_gdt2ms,1588702808.0,"So I think the problem we're facing here is that this sub is mainly American based, and their 'left' is most other place's 'liberal'. The Democrats are socially centre-left, economically centre right. This sub is not really *leftist*, but it's very difficult to find leftists who support MRAs or criticise Feminism at this current point in time. Because of the liberation movements narratives, it's assumed that it's mostly men who are the ruling class so if you're a rights activist for 'men' you are-somehow, we don't assume this with any other movement but whatever-shilling for the ruling class males and therefore cannot be a comrade. 

That said, there are some leftists here, and a lot of pro social democracy liberals-who are generally a minority in other MRA groups.

As to the difference between MRA and male advocate, well that can mean one of two things. Either 

i) the 'A' in MRA stands for *Activist*, and this designates that MRA is a more professional and public commitment to service to men and boys than male advocates, who only need to 'speak up for men and boys' (many regard this as social media slacktivism) 

ii) you find the cohort typically identifying as 'MRA' problematic so refuse to adopt that label [generally but not always Men's Lib dudes do this, but so do ex-feminists like me]"

This doesn't mean I'll never work again but it means that I get a lot of financial and vocational support, assistance finding and...staying alive while studying, training, whatever. I also have living and understanding friends and family. 

Many men are not so lucky; most of the funding by both public AND private sector goes to women. Masculinity Studies is aware of this but can't rationalise it with patriarchy theory except through arguing something like ""we assume women to be financial dependents and not have their own income, so they need the money more."" (Well, we no longer do, in fact, women in their 20s out-earn men now!) Or, of course, it's because men don't care-which is true but that's because of gynocentrism and male thirst, now we've gone in circles. 

Besides this, there is the 'man up' component, feminists are right there, and stronger demand for you not to be a 'leech'.

LeftWingMaleAdvocates,fmn526r,t3_fvb0vh,1586218367.0,"I hate to say it but. You're overestimating the investment in political philosophy of the average person. 

A lot of feminism's victories have come from the general public being **too damn busy working** to notice the legislative changes. They also happened in the Boomer and early Gen X generation JUST before the rise of the surveillance state, at the *very* beginning of media transparency (but subsequently yellow journalism) and of mass technology and globalisation. The result is that when people encounter feminist ideas it's mostly entrenched in pop culture *without* having to use technical terms. 

Now add to this that *besides* patriarchy theory framing the conversation, we're a gynocentric species and consequentially respond stronger/are more sensitive to female pain than male pain. That means the burden of rational proof is here for justifying advocacy for men, than for women where emotional reasoning and just general 'instinct to moral duty' can be a major motivation.

edit: You CAN argue that helping men helps women. But they think feminist theory already covers this. You're naive if you think that there isn't partially a desire to reduce violence against women embedded in desires for better male mental health.

Anarchism,fkxp44b,t3_fl22vf,1584632689.0,"No. If you strike now before the death count has declined, then the libs will forever use this to turn the public against you."
unitedkingdom,fkwo7nv,t1_fkw6scx,1584599031.0,"The closest we ever got was the English Civil War, which ultimately resulted in us becoming a constitutional monarchy.

After that? Rule Britannia wasn't exactly on the pro-revolution end of the American and French revolutions, funnily enough..."

relationship_advice,fkw1xrh,t3_fl1frs,1584581609.0,Definitely only do this if you're looking at serial monogamy and growing with someone rather than settling down. I tried but I wasn't ready and to say it ended badly would be an understatement.
Anxiety,fkw0l95,t3_fkq88w,1584580755.0,"Yeah man, hell I was going to challenge my anxiety the whole 9 yards by going to China to TEFL before Christmas, then this broke out and I lost all confidence in it.  

Then I was going to start work experience in schools and youth clubs to begin teacher assistant training, and that sonofagun Coroney made its way over here to shut down all the schools."
LeftWingMaleAdvocates,fkw03qx,t1_fkvupdx,1584580448.0,"As somebody attempting to read feminist theory proper to be more professional an advocate, I have to say that MRAs will struggle to present a peer-reviewed counter-argument to any feminist essay because **they're literally banned from universities.** When they ARE funded, it's mostly by conservative think-tanks and feminists use this as proof that it's disingenuous criticism as a way to shoehorn politics in (worse *it indeed is sometimes.*) 

The closest we have are Men's Libbers like Raewyn Connell."

There are people who are so utterly paranoid about Big Brother encroaching on their freedom as an individual that they would rather risk death by fluids filling their lungs than admit they Live In A Society."

Not sure why we can't just go on summer: off, winter: on shifts... (I realise this is absurdly triviialising what a lock-down entails, but assume that artificial resources aren't a problem and the virology is the main factor)"

againstmensrights,fkpiqi7,t1_fipqufq,1584411106.0,"Hi! Can you link me to this Tweet please? I haven't seen anything which sounds like this, but I've seen evidence that Elam is essentially a 'bootlicker', that is his rhetoric about male disposability is disingenuous since ultimately he views the rich (mostly white men) as morally superior to the poor."
