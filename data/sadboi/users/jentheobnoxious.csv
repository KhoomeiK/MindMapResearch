He will absolutely not react well when you tell him you're moving out, so I encourage you to remember that he's just really terrified of losing you and accepting any type of change.

op, your aunt is projecting and your mother is the one that is being sly. This is awful. Your mother stole your stuff. Your mother committed a crime. You paid for those clothes. She stole them. Plain and simple. 

As for everyone saying you're being dramatic.... 

My clothes are my world. I sew my own clothes, so they're very very precious to me. But I definitely own some clothes I didn't make that I cherish just as much. My clothing is how I express myself. The way I dress is am expression of art. Your mother didn't throw away your art supplies because she knows you love that stuff. People don't really talk about how much they love their clothes cause it kinda comes off as materialistic, so it just doesn't come up often in conversation. 

I think because your mom didn't just throw everything away she wasn't TRYING to be an asshole... But again. She stole your stuff, dude. Like even if it's ""just clothes"" they're still not hers to touch. She could have just taken them away until the rest of your room was cleaned up.

You used something that couples who are getting divorced do to punish someone you apparently love (but it doesn't seem like you love her unless she's doing what you want her to do) and not only that... 

You punished her for not wanting to WATCH YOU play a video game. Even if she says she likes watching sometimes that doesn't mean she HAS to watch all the time.

IllegalLifeProTips,fopeycs,t3_g8mta5,1587959773.0,"Different states have different laws, so that can make things a little harder. Usually, if you ask if they're 18 and they say yes that means you're in the clear legally.

In my book, if you're ever unsure, be confident and flirty and tell them ""mmm but babe you just look so young ðŸ˜˜"" or some dumb shit lol. Tell them they can block out all the sensetive info on the ID with a piece of paper or something.

 Honestly, the only people who are gonna be shitty about it are minors and people who are being fucking shady anyway. 

Sometimes you're gonna lose out on some coin bc you have to ID some people and they're not gonna be down but it's really worth it at the end of the day."

All I'll say is lube got under my computer screen and it still works perfectly, the screen is just a little messed up. It's touch screen and it still works. It just looks pretty fuckin awful lol. 

If you have to mail it in or something this probably won't work, but if you just need to take pictures this absolutely looks like water damage or some shit."
