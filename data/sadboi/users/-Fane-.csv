BPD,fonbjy4,t1_fonbffu,1587916297.0,The problem is that you never know when it’s actually done to you because you can’t recall what really happend.
BPD,fon2xro,t3_g856o2,1587911000.0,"Oh my god I’m not alone! I black out everytime I split on my current partner, I only remember the big lines of the fight and words and actions that marked me in a good or a bad way. 
My childhood and my past 4 year relationship are also a big blur, probably for the best though. 
I’ve also been told that I remember things differently, kinda sucks because I always doubt myself when someone gives his side of the story because i don’t trust my memories that much. That makes me such an easy target to manipulate. 
Stay strong my fellow bpd solders."

BPD,flcu4zv,t3_fnsdtp,1585046672.0,For most people skinny is an insult. People usually avoir to use the word skinny to describe someone specially when they know they have an ED. So don’t take it personal. I’ve been suffering from an ED since the age of 16 that’s 8 years ago and it took me years to understand that people might see you as beautiful even if your not skinny. Your friend was just looking up for you and trying to make you feel better so don’t take it personal.

BPD,fjgcit8,t3_fd5yqt,1583321933.0," I don’t get why I feel the urge of getting everyone to like me, not be in love with me but emotionally attached. I usually get there but since i’m being so nice they think I’m flirting and being promiscuous. In the last week I’ve been told by two friends that they have strong feelings for me but they wish I wasn’t so promiscuous that everyone thinks I’m a b*tch.. 
I basically spent an hour with each explaining why everyone thinks I’m flirting with them and the reasons behind my behavior. It was physically and mentally exhausting. Then I went home and never felt so alone and disgusted with myself."

BPD,fj3qjoc,t3_faf3cw,1582990830.0,"I’ve been in a relationship for like almost 3 years now, I have bpd and some other problems, I’m a 24 yo F. I do react exactly the same as to when it come to spacing out anger issues etc.. but even before my diagnosis my boyfriend knew that something was wrong and even my I get an episode he tries to calm me down and wait for it to pass. If you give some tips to your girl about how to manage you when you get angry we’ll your relationship will really benefit for it. Plus if you work with her of your triggers etc.. that will only bring you closer together. Let’s be honest we way be mean and hurtful sometimes without meaning to but most of the time we are lovely and we give all of our heart to the person we love. You have a disorder don’t blame yourself for things you can’t control. The only thing you can do is make the right decision when you’re in a good state of mind. Hope this helps!
