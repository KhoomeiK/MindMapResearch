BPD,fon2xro,t3_g856o2,1587911000.0,"Oh my god I‚Äôm not alone! I black out everytime I split on my current partner, I only remember the big lines of the fight and words and actions that marked me in a good or a bad way. 
My childhood and my past 4 year relationship are also a big blur, probably for the best though. 
I‚Äôve also been told that I remember things differently, kinda sucks because I always doubt myself when someone gives his side of the story because i don‚Äôt trust my memories that much. That makes me such an easy target to manipulate. 
Stay strong my fellow bpd solders."

I‚Äôve been suffering from an ED since the age of 16 that‚Äôs 8 years ago and it took me years to understand that people might see you as beautiful even if your not skinny. Your friend was just looking up for you and trying to make you feel better so don‚Äôt take it personal.

I basically spent an hour with each explaining why everyone thinks I‚Äôm flirting with them and the reasons behind my behavior. It was physically and mentally exhausting. Then I went home and never felt so alone and disgusted with myself."
