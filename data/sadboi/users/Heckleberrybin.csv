I was wandering through an almost deserted mall (I needed to pick up some bits from the pharmacy and for the cat), and for maybe the first time *ever* I wasn't tempted to duck into any clothes shops. All my trips and events are cancelled, so there were zero impulses to buy or browse.

Then I got to thinking, why did I think I ever needed stuff for either of those things anyway, when my wardrobe is literally full to bursting? Why do I link having a trip or event with the need to buy? It's pure anxiety I realise now - pre-planning outfits for events to distract from social anxiety, pre-buying for trips to distract from nerves about travel. Without either of those things, I'm totally able to rationalise about what I should be spending on.

I am very much looking forward/hopeful for life picking up again in due time, but when I'm lucky enough to have travel or an event to look forward to again, I'm going to remember how I felt, and question any spending impulses that arise in the future!"

A weird bonus is, having had a break from products, my skin looks better than ever, and my hair has so much length!

I’ve booked a session with a career counsellor with on Monday to help cut through my own shitty noise and focus on the goals ahead and how I’m going to get there. 

I’ve invested in some meal replacement bars because meal planning has become stressful and I’m binging like fuck. This isn’t a long term solution, but it’s gonna get me through this rough patch, and hopefully offset holiday sweets and etc. 

I’m taking my tablet to the gym and watching episodes of favourite shows on the cross trainer. Again, this isn’t a long term fix, but at my lowest, I’m still moving my body. 

We both might have slipped a few rungs down the ladder, the important thing now is not falling off entirely (to strain the metaphor!). 

All of these alone won’t get me back to the place where I’m losing fast and looking great,  but I know they will help. I know they won’t make things worse.

You will be surrounded by the people who love you best and want to come together to celebrate both you and your partner. Congratulations on this amazing achievement! Two months is a short time too - if the mental barrier is going under 150, hypothetically, if this is a few wedding confidence pounds, say even going to 145, why not pretend it's a temporary thing - like a veil, or wedding nails, or long hair for an updo you're  going to cut the week after. It's something you're doing with a laser focus on the day, not changing your body forever. Plenty of people get into things like long hair, working out, teeth bleaching, etc. with an eye solely on the bridal look. You'll breach the barrier for 60 days, and then once the day is done, you can see how you feel, and whether you choose to continue or not, you'll have beautiful memories of feeling wonderful and lovely pictures to look back on."

shoppingaddiction,ey5fp1l,t1_ey54rcm,1566830501.0,Thank you! You’re so spot on - that idea that a piece of clothing is going to bring you back to yourself. So happy for you that you’ve managed to get yourself to a better place.

WeightLossAdvice,exr0rzu,t1_exq8922,1566509713.0,Could be! Or a snack if you want to boost up to 1200 cals.
WeightLossAdvice,expmd39,t1_exoge60,1566491953.0,"Yes! Even better if you can combine it with some low fat protein, and try not to go over 3 servings a day.  An example could be an apple with a teaspoon of sugar-free peanut butter, or some berries and a small piece of low fat cheese. Be sure to log these calories too."
WeightLossAdvice,exodaf0,t3_ctw6q6,1566474404.0,I would aim for at least 1200 calories - 800 is low enough you’re likely not getting all the nutrients you need.
loseit,exnik6e,t3_ctt98h,1566457024.0,"I feel this sometimes! A bit like checking your bank balance when you know you’ve been sloppy, there comes a time when if you want to move forward you just have to do it. Then do it a few days later and see you’ve dropped a few, and repeat..."
BingeEatingDisorder,ewu3mku,t3_cq2b20,1565763037.0,"I get that. I went through a pro-ana forum reading obsession in my teens too.  The more I recovered from severe restriction, the more lucid I became about how strangely a starving mind sees the world. These people are all performing checks in the same way they might weigh themselves constantly or use string to check their waist, etc. You’re doing the right thing leaving it behind you!"

WeightLossAdvice,ewlig74,t3_coqgqt,1565525606.0,"Exercise doesn't have to be pain! The internet can give a distorted view that fitness is all macros and weights and omg gainz. If you're just looking to drop a few, not chisel your body into an Adonis shape, really just a bit of extra walking while you  listen to a podcast will help, or a 20 minute video. The people who want very low body fat or huge muscle may have to be obsessive, but not you."
loseit,ewi0l4o,t3_cogaq1,1565432626.0,"Yes! Any 0 cal sugar free mixer. Vodka or gin (pure, not a sugary liquor version) and plenty of water. Log ahead to give you a calorie allowance - and have some healthy whole grains in for the next day in case hangover cravings hit. Vietnamese summer rolls, fried eggs (with spray, not oil) on low calorie bread and pulled chicken are all good ‘junk’ options that won’t destroy your plan. Also, the lower your daily food intake and higher your weight loss, the less booze it’ll take for you to get smashed - so keep going and you’ll need less booze anyway."
progresspics,ewhz6wr,t3_cofu0m,1565430405.0,"Did you do anything special to avoid weight gain on anti-depressants? Even a really low dose one for migraines made me a fiend for carbs, especially in the evening."
shoppingaddiction,ewd8qvt,t1_ewbt21q,1565296866.0,"I did but was referred to counselling. I am really nervous about the idea of antidepressants, though I know that’s stupid and they help many people."
loseit,ew3cdi5,t3_cmgreh,1565072220.0,"I think what you’re feeling now in some ways could tie into how our society glorified thinness. You’re told that being skinny equates with having your best life and feeling successful. You’ve suddenly got that prized body and yet everything feels shitty, if not worse than before. That lie has been exposed and it hurts.

Obviously being fitter and healthier is important and life is probably horrible when you’re incapacitated by your weight - but your body is only 50% of the health story. The rest is how you feel in your mind. I recommend seeking out some credible books on this area (note: not Tumblr/Instagram self-appointed ‘experts’ - they be crazy). 

Try Fat is a Feminist Issue or The Beauty Myth for size. If nothing else, it might help put things in perspective, which will soothe your anxiety about this new body and maybe even stop you regaining everything."
loseit,ew3byid,t3_cmhllw,1565071711.0,"Happened to me - my hair was long but got so thin. My hairdresser told me at one point she wanted to stop halfway through dying my hair because so much was falling out! 

What triggered it was I was doing 5:2 and eating very little on the off days. Lost 15 pounds in 2 months (mostly because I was really sad and depressed which fuelled the underrating). I started to feel better and the weight came back slowly, but I’d already triggered the hair shed. 

If you’re eating healthy now, what helped for me was starting to take vitamins too and not tying my hair back as much as I could. I didn’t cut it when the shed was at its worst because having more length helped to style my hair to give the illusion of volume. One my hair grew back in, I did get a good cut because it was quite ragged and thicker in some areas. 

Good luck! And listen to your body. Give it the nutrients it needs. You might not care about your hair too much, but think of it as the canary in your proverbial coal mine."
