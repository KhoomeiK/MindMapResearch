DiagnoseMe,fqnfb3o,t3_gjob3h,1589493824.0,"Cerumen (the mix of earwax, oil & dead skin cells) does indeed darken, get crusty with age like this, and pull skin cells out with it. This tends to happen if people clean their ears with Q-tips which is not necessary, your ear is actually a self-cleaning organ. 

Biology lesson: in your ear canal you have tiny hairs (cilia), wax glands, and oil glands - all of which are only found on the outer section of your ear canal. If you use Q-tips (as I suspect you do because a lot of people do) it pushes the collection of this earwax inside past the fine hairs that ""sweep"" it out of your ear canal naturally. The wax gets stuck & piled up, usually by or on your eardrum. It does affect how well you hear. Hearing aid users get this often too because their ear canal is plugged up with earmolds for their hearing aids. 

Next time you go to the doctor, ask them to look in your ears. Chances are (especially if you're a Q-tip user) you have earwax crusted around your eardrum which can be cleaned off with a simple irrigation procedure by an audiologist."

Often it affects your language as people who stutter will choose words on which they’re more likely to be fluent - sometimes making for a clunky answer. Sometimes they use the same phrase repeatedly because they know they can say it fluently NOW. Emotions also come into play and increase the chances of being disfluent, which puts more pressure back on you the stutterer.

BipolarReddit,fo85zou,t1_fo44p24,1587590510.0,"The psychiatrist who diagnosed me as bipolar had a mini-fridge with everything nonalcoholic in it. Why? Having a beverage is disarming and she can see the real you, not the you that you unconsciously brought to your appointment today that's going to say you're doing ok when you're not ok."
AskReddit,fo85mce,t1_fo84wiv,1587590321.0,"Well I wouldn't want everybody to think exactly like me because I think diversity and balance are crucial in the political process, but if we could get 70% to just have some basic but strong concept of ""treat others kindly"" and let that guide us in politics instead of hot-button issues like abortion and guns, that would do a lot."
AskReddit,fo855hz,t1_fo6awaj,1587590079.0,I'm disabled. Working a job for more than six months that doesn't make me crash and take years to recover but still gives me access to the healthcare and stability I need is a total pipe dream.
AskReddit,fo84w3f,t1_fo6hywx,1587589946.0,"I could get behind that. But how do you define basic needs? Clearly high speed internet is now a basic need, not just so people can stream Netflix for leisure."

AskAnAmerican,fo84gmx,t3_g61hi1,1587589727.0,"I'll put it this way: today I dropped off a box of homemade masks at the town grocery store today. Anonymously. Why? Because if people knew it was me, it would be ""a liberal elite from the city forcing us to wear masks and we ain't gonna be told what to do with our bodies"" type bullshit. I grew up in the next town over and the only difference between me and the general population is I have college degrees. Thanks to a disability with years of no medical care (don't forget the crushing student debt), I'm actually as poor as everybody else here. I just don't want us to get more COVID cases over stupidity and stigma, that's all. 

If I \*have\* to stay here past quarantine I know my only options on the November ballot for local races will be Republicans. A Democrat can't even get elected dogcatcher in this part of the world. It's maddening."

AskAnAmerican,fo63cky,t3_g5nzog,1587544959.0,"I’m going to have to disagree with social mobility. The vast majority of people I know who are born poor, stay poor. Same for the wealthy ones. Middle class is tending to get poorer instead of advancing. Upward mobility is more illusion than truth."
DiagnoseMe,fo632eh,t1_fo5qg5y,1587544655.0,"SLP, I would suspect adenoids were removed too and that teeny bit of tissue made all the difference for the OP in getting velopharyngeal closure. A typical human adult (ie no cleft palate or injury) should learn to compensate within a few weeks."

BipolarReddit,fo625jq,t3_g5jr0y,1587543688.0,"I accidentally found out that my now-former psychiatrist diagnosed me as schizoaffective and while I contest that label, the worst part is he didn’t tell me so I could make appropriate treatment decisions. He hid it like it was something to be ashamed of or like I couldn’t be trusted to know. 


He also said “well I think that’s as good as your anxiety is going to get” when I told him I had been waking up with panic attacks including one in which I was trying to find something to kill myself with until I woke up and realized that wasn’t necessary. Same meds, follow up in two months. That was the moment he became my former psychiatrist."
AskAnAmerican,fo61opw,t3_g5dzup,1587543195.0,"You should know we’re an actual shithole country. I make a whopping $249 a week on unemployment and my state thinks I’m doing well enough in the food department that $16 a month in food stamps should be sufficient. I’m a citizen by birth, very sick yet unable to get proper healthcare. The American dream is an illusion for me."

AskReddit,fo5xmvr,t1_fnz5ply,1587539091.0,"I worked for one of those too! Pillsbury Cream Cake for everything. Madagascar vanilla in everything too... oh wait that's a gallon of imitation vanilla you're supposed to accidentally pick up instead of the far smaller and more expensive bottle of Madagascar vanilla next to it on the shelf. They toyed with taking ""Madagascar vanilla"" out of all product descriptions except their vanilla cake so as to let the customer assume Madagascar vanilla was in all product. Decided to go with the straight-up lie. Fired me for not bringing mono to the workplace where I was stationed next to a pregnant person. I have no love for these people."
