Anyone who can paint completely without issues while fully assembled is some kind of rock star.

Sorry for the edits, but the process I use is prime, base colour, avoiding areas that won't be the same as the base colour, then I paint the areas where the joints are. Normally I mess up a bit when painting the knee or arm pits so I clean that up. After that I add the details like the aquilla, knee pads, pauldron rims.
