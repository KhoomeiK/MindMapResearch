Mortality rate for mother and child is like that of a third world country and republicans still push back against laws and services that would solve a lot of these problems. That’s a large reason it seems apparent that conservatives not only don’t care but actually dislike women. I think that the real feminist agenda, not the extremist end of it also care about all people! I believe extremists in any group kind of tarnish it for the rest of us, but I urge you to consider that feminism is not about exclusion in anyway, it’s about all minorities that’s struggle to access things that specifically white men have in abundance, such as healthcare related services. And don’t forget, feminist don’t hate men. They actually strongly believe that mental health is something that needs to be more accessible for men!

I think a lot of people just don’t know how to confidently communicate with someone that is a professional. Hairstylists see so many different types and lengths, unless you tell them exactly what you want, it’s hard for them, they can’t read your mind. It took me years to acquire the vocabulary that the stylist needs to hear. “Shorter” or “layers” isn’t enough. They need pictures and decent communication at the least. I don’t think they ever intend to “rip you off”, they just need you to help them understand your hair which a lot of people don’t realize. I’m not a stylist, I am just incredibly particular about my haircuts and have difficult hair so I had to learn what to say and speak up- I almost always ask for a couple changes once they are done! And they never seem upset, but the key is you have to know what you’re trying to say."

henna,fnxdfl9,t3_g4ewq2,1587336385.0,Wow this is a great idea!!! Does this damage the henna? Or will it still work just the same?
kratom,fnx2uyt,t3_g4bbkv,1587330390.0,"I actually add a pinch of salt to coffee too! Never thought to add it to kratom, that’s a great idea"
ADHD,fntrw4f,t3_g3lu8m,1587247511.0,"I tried multiple pairs and turns out, they give me motion sickness :( I threw up multiple times before I found out it was the headphones. It’s rare that this happens but I don’t want someone extremely sensitive to motion sickness to invest in them, they were not cheap!"

SuicideWatch,fnlvc43,t3_g2hrxj,1587060369.0,I get that last part. I have a terminally ill sibling. I would do anything to trade places with them so they could enjoy life since I never have. Have you stopped taking your medication?
SuicideWatch,fnk0ud3,t3_g1xeo8,1587011776.0,"I just want to say that if you are even considering calling a doctor, set a goal that the only thing you will do tomorrow is that. Just call, see how long the next available appointment is and do it. Please go, I know I know I know how annoying it is to hear it. But please I’m begging you to do this for YOU because once you get even the slightest bit of help you will realize how much your husband dog etc think of you. It’s impossible to see it now, I know it is. And no one wants to hear they are selfish or wrong to feel the way they feel because you are not wrong. You are allowed to feel this way, a lot of people do and have including myself. You feel the way you do, and you deserve help. If you need help making the call I will even give you a script to read from! I was in your shoes 6 months ago and now I can’t even fathom going back to that place. And it started with my friend scripting my phone call for me because I also couldn’t do that"

socialskills,fmwnmov,t1_fmwneb4,1586449793.0,That’s okay! You had some errors but I could still understand what you meant. Have you tried reading any books? I’ve found that knowing about something interesting is really useful when engaging people in conversation.
