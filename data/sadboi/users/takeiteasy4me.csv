NewTubers,ewvysmt,t1_ewvxqs3,1565816812.0,"Thank you so much! 

Also just one question I forgot to ask if you get a spare the minute - the production quality of your videos is insanely good between the cinematography, music choices and camera angles...is there any particular channel on YouTube or resource you used to learn and get to your level?"
NewTubers,ewvtydg,t3_cq6ovg,1565813889.0,"Unreal channel man! Just watched some of you for the first time and easy to see how you’ve grown so fast with your personality, quality production and value add.

My questions are if you get a chance to answer:

1. Do you have any tips for keeping yourself motivated in that early period of YouTube where nobody is really watching your videos and the lack of views can be disheartening? 

2. Do you have any particular way you approach coming up with titles for videos as I know you mentioned somewhere in the thread that looking for trending titles can be important? 

3. What is one piece of advice you would give to yourself when you started YouTube or others starting YouTube now? 

4. What is the biggest mistake you see YouTubers make? 

Thank you again. I look forward to watching more of your videos going forward. Keep up the great work!"
FantasyPL,ewumafx,t3_cq0sis,1565785859.0,"Always cheating and fpl surgery are my two favorites. Very good blend of insight and banter. 

Always cheating has a great variety of content and brilliant chemistry between the two hosts.

Similarly, fpl surgery has fantastic hosts and provides unique insights through knowledgeable guests like the stats guy they had on recently who highlighted the importance of the amount of shots taken in a game statistic."

lonely,evghl1p,t3_cjrhuw,1564510590.0,"Very nice changes. I found #2 a big help for me. When I was particularly lonely in college I started back into playing rugby again. Helped reduce my loneliness by 10x. 

Was nervous as crap the first day but once you get over that you never look back and it feels amazing to be a part of a community. 

Obviously, doesn’t have to be rugby but if there’s a hobby like yoga or anything along those lines you’d like to try id say go for it"
mentalhealth,evggz1q,t3_cjpxq3,1564510356.0,Thank you bud. I often find little things like this or someone holding the door open for me really make big differences in days where assholes tend to take all the limelight in your brain

mentalhealth,eul015t,t3_cgr549,1563895255.0,Can relate to this a lot. Just been work sleep work sleep work sleep for the last few months now it feels like an endless pit. Happily married but work is draining me so much it’s affecting the relationship and I barely hang out socially anymore. Crazy how much a stressful job with long hours and shitty pay can make every day such a battle.
mentalhealth,eublf0e,t3_cfoal9,1563650880.0,Beautifully beautifully written. Needed to hear this today. Really appreciate the importance of not being afraid to go into second gear at times when feeling overwhelmed instead of just turning the engine off
