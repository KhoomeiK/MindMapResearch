And YES about EDs not being included in mental health awareness. I'm so glad things like depression and anxiety have gotten so much attention recently, but we need advocates from all ends of things.

I wasn't overreacting because we just talked things out, I had emotion in my voice but I wasn't yelling or anything and neither was he. I tried to drop it and we just started watching this show, but you know the rest.

That doesn't mean he takes me seriously, though. He's immature himself, so we're basically the same mental age because he's a man-child, but that doesn't change the fact that he has adult feelings and experiences that I just won't be able to relate to. Same goes for him, though. I'm sure its hard for him to relate to some of the stuff I go through, as a teenage girl. You know, he's never been there, he can only go off what he sees and what I say.

Just take it easy. I don't regret getting with him, but I do regret not getting to know him better first. You should be close friends for a while before you take things to the next level, things will play out better that way. I cannot explain to you enough how important this is. Once you start dating someone, they effect your ego like you wouldn't believe. They are a HUGE source of your confidence. Any fights you have as friends, no big deal for the most part. But as a couple? It feels like life or death. Take it seriously, just because you're young doesn't make it any less crazy to deal with. If anything, it makes it crazier because you don't have the maturity to handle things, well, maturely. Not to say you're not smart, that's not what I mean, but there's a big difference between being 15 and 20 that's nothing to sneeze at, okay. Take it slow."

I have a feeling we were just using our words wrong, and actually agreed with each other this entire time about the state of our educational facilities. They suck. General college tuition was like $8000-$9000 back in the 80s. Now it's something like $20k-$30k. It's more than doubled, with wages staying about the same. That's obviously a problem, and discourages otherwise smart people from going to school. Not to make it all political, but fuck it. That's why I'm voting for Bernie. I know plenty of people hate him because they don't understand his policies or his vision, or because of how he seems not to comment at all about infrastructure in our country even though it's one of our biggest problems, but college is way too expensive.

But if I'm being anecdotal here, I have to say so are you. Just because you already knew everything going into college, doesn't mean that applies to most other people.

They tell the teacher they're wrong, they try and ""educate"" the rest of the class with their ""higher knowledge"". I saw my younger self in this kid until I read your comment, I was never that much of an entitled prick. The most self-righteous I ever got was having religious debates with this Muslim kid all the time. Although those were fun for both of us, but looking back its silly. I had only just weeks before found out I don't believe in God, so we would get into all sorts of philosophical arguments about God and his existence."

But then mental illness hit me like a ton of bricks and even though all my peers were now excelling where I lacked, I still held this false idea of myself as the genius among them. I feel bad for this kid, because I can relate to them. They obviously stopped trying a long time ago, and we can only assume its because of some sort of mental illness. Healthy people don't just give up like that."

I'm not trying to be rude, just saying they never said you can only use intelligence when applying it to your academic career. They used inventing something as an example, but that's all it was, an example. Not the only one truth. At least that's how I took it. If they seriously meant ONLY inventors are smart, and ONLY people who criticize them are dumb, then I agree with your point more. But I doubt that's what they meant."

How are you supposed to cook anything, follow any recipe, if you don't know this kind of math?

I'm not the pinnacle of good grades, so I'll use my friend as an example. She was the same way, just grinding her way through. There were like 2 classes she actually liked, to be generous. Realistically, I think she only actually enjoyed her psychology class, since she went on to AP psychology just because she wanted more of it. Straight As with an occasional B or C.

I'm just saying, its not about passion. You could say that's sad, but high-school is just college prep. It should be life prep, but they really push you to go to college, so I don't know why this is a surprise to so many people once they get there."

Some people, surprisingly, DO have to ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps"" and actually try.

iamverysmart,fk59ijt,t1_fk4crqt,1583876095.0,"Wait so you were a genius that INTENTIONALLY got bad grades? If you were a genius, you would understand how much society values high grades, ignore the opinions of the peers who at this point are beneath you (their opinions, not their persons), and get 4.0+ gpa every year. And no offense, but an IQ test you took in middle school says diddly squat about your intelligence. I'm just having a hard time understanding how you can call yourself a genius, yet you got bad grades and I can only assume you aren't a polymath or any other label that we use to characterize a typical genius.

All I'm saying is there's nothing wrong with being an average person. Average people are great. I'm friend with all kinds of average people and they're amazing, they have a bunch of potential behind them. Why would you choose to alienate yourself with a false character trait, rather than accepting yourself as a typical human being and enjoying life as it exists for you? Not being the next Leonardo Da Vinci isn't a problem. And if you really want to be a genius, do it. Study your ass off and prove to yourself that this trait you've adopted is in fact true. But it seems instead you're content living off $20/hr and enjoying life as a regular person, which is okay, but so far from being a genius."

Being able to empathize is very difficult for plenty of grown adults, and you don't realize how valuable it is until you attain that ability. You can use empathy to get all sorts of things, to really make friends and connections inside a business is the number one way to work yourself to the top. Being a good speaker, not being nervous in social situations, these are both forms of emotional intelligence that can propel you to the top of your game. Even if you don't care about career advancement, just in terms of being alive and being human, its so important to be emotionally intelligent. You can have all sorts of friends that will help you out in tough situations, you can be a successful romantic partner and have a fulfilling relationship. Its one of the traits I value most when making new friends."

I knew a guy when I was working at Target who did this regularly, it was an entire side job for him. Some people do this with concert tickets, but plenty of ticket salespeople have ways to prevent this from happening so its kind of a dead way to cheat this."
iamverysmart,fk574gl,t1_fk4zvf2,1583874759.0,"I agree, to a point. I thought I never wanted to go to college, because I didn't know what I wanted to do after high-school. Because of this, I didn't try, and I didn't give a shit, because none of it really mattered to me. Now I know I want to pursue a DVM, and college is the way to learn about these advanced skills. If you just toss your way through a paid education, without any real idea of where its taking you, that's short-sighted and the reason people like you complain about public education. It's not a big bad evil the way you think it is, its actually a great gift that I have the ability to send myself through school, and I'm very happy this is possible for me. No one is forcing you to go to school, that's a personal choice. Not even in high-school, I dropped out, I would know. It was a bad move, but it was possible.

""Honing skills and natural talents is the only way to be exceptional"" yes, this is true. And that's exactly why colleges have a perfectly laid out study plan for people who WANT to hone these talents and skills. Same thing with community college, or local unions. They exist to hone these skills and provide EDUCATION to the general population. Don't demonize an education, it's one of the greatest things you can get if you plan on advancing in your career. The lowest 10% of veterinarians make over $50k a year. The LOWEST. On average, they make around $90k-$100k. Getting my DVM, working my ass off at a job I love, and making enough money to live a very comfortable life, is not a result of me being brainwashed by the government and shoved through the educational machine."

It's an easy way out of trying, if you pretend to be a genius and everything is beneath you, it doesn't matter if you fail at everything they throw at you, because you can pretend that after you graduate (or don't) everything will work itself out because you're just so super smart. It falls in line with people's strange romanticizing of manipulation techniques, being a scary ""bad-ass"" that can dominate their way through life, and having all the genius 200+ IQ you'll ever need. It's all a fantasy. It's sad, because its a lot easier to pretend your entire life that everyone sucks, rather than accepting your true self and then striving to really become that ""super genius"" you've glorified your entire life. I see people like this, and I just feel bad for them, because I used to be them. I woke up, and now I know I'm not the best, brightest kid in town. I realized geniuses aren't born that way, they're made. It's led me to actually care about my education, my friends, my family. Anyways, rant over.

I get what you mean, though, I had intense problems focusing because of un-diagnosed depression, anxiety, and ADD. And even though I was a smart kid, my grades made me feel stupid. 

This kid just seems to think grades don't matter, which is true if you plan on ending your education right after graduating. I don't agree with how the school system in our country functions, as far as grades and gpa goes, and how it affects our abilities to get into higher education and being given financial aid. But I don't like this guy's attitude, because I had the same one back in the day. I thought I was a ""misunderstood genius"" like this kid, and it ruined whatever potential I had left for school. It's just a toxic mindset to toss yourself into, and an easy (although false) characterization of yourself that only serves to legitimize giving up on your education, instead of finding realistic ways to make it work for you."

I mean heck, learn whatever you want to learn about. But don't act like its anything more than a fun read, rather than genuine educational piece that you can use to further your life in any way."
