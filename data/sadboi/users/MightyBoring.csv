As for acceptable level of violence, I don’t know. I’ve played Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption since my diagnosis, mainly to just play around in their open world environments. However, it’s pretty easy to accidentally start a fight even if you’re not doing any missions and I haven’t played either for over a year. 

I used to play first person shooters, but I’m hesitant to try again even if I could turn off the blood as I’m not sure how I’d take it. 

I think something like ‘Last of Us’ or Becoming Human might be OK."

Finally got to the point where I was calling my orthopedic Dr twice a week telling her something else was wrong. She left town for a conference and wouldn’t prescribe anything stronger than 600 mg ibuprofen. 

After being awake for 40+ hours in excruciating pain and every movement about dropping me to my knees, I gave up and went to the ER. They did an MRI and immediately recognized what was going on and started pushing dilaudid. They basically told me good luck and discharged me with 30 Oxy pills. 

Went back to my Orthopedic Dr who apologized and jammed needles into my shoulder to irrigate the calcium deposits away. 

0/10 would not do again"
