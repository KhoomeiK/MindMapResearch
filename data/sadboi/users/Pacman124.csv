The americans as we know today (or at least the one that descends from europeans) used to participate in the wars for several centuries in Europe that you were referring to. 

So in what way should it be a valable excuse to blame Europe's war waging when the US didn't even exist as a country back then? You americans were part of the dark european ages aswell, just not as americans but as europeans

Take a person who's never had it, they're emotionally naive, immature. They're just getting taken advantage from. When you're young, you're emotionally naive, you wanna have fun, but as you grow older, society expects you to get your, shit together.

A man who's never had a relationship in his life finds a partner in his mid thirties, and naive as he is, he will jump straight into marriage, because that's what society expects from them at their age, although emotionally, they're far from ready to get married and have kids, they never had a functioning relationship before.

Women get pressured to have kids because of their biological clock. A woman who's never had a relationship before finds someone in her thirties and settles for him because she doesn' thave time. You don't know how many times i've seen this and it never ends well. $

MensRights,eyyijom,t1_eyydl0d,1567589216.0,"It's messed up how she is the secretary of state, she doesn't make any sense.''Equality between men and women'' my ass. She hasn't talked about problems regarding men a single time, it's all about women. Don't talk about equality, she just wants to promote women. Never heard her say anything about how we could fight against false rape accusations, never heard anything about how 90 percents of dustmen are men (funnily anough, i don't hear her spout about how unfair the lack of women in this field is). Instead she's crying about how there is a majority of men in executive positions. It's not like competence and skill has anything to do with it. She would totally promote a squad of 5 incompetent women rather than one of 5 competent men. That shows you how biased she is.

Here and there, you can find a post  where a girl shows her hair, a youtube video of a bob haircut, but most posts are about headshaving and/or roleplays (who get totally ignored when posted by men anyways)

&#x200B;

It would be good, to perhaps have several pinned threads (kind of like a subreddit in the subreddit), and each thread focuses on something.

&#x200B;

Long hair pics/videos -> thread

&#x200B;

bob haircuts (love them and we don't see enough of it) -> thread

&#x200B;

radical transformations (videos + before/after pics) -> thread

Tbf, i'm not really a fan of buzzcuts or headshaving. In several ''buzzcut fetish videos"", what i like the most is the beginning where they play with the hair, brush it out and start off with haircutting, i generally skip the buzzing part."

MensRights,ev0i314,t3_chwtki,1564139187.0,"when i see women like you, i still have hope. The problem is that you can't really make any difference at first sight. I don't really interact with girls to begin with. I used to be very uncomfortable around girls, now i don't really care that much anymore tbh.

&#x200B;

Since, the whole metoo crap, and the fact that just because i'm a dude, i'm a ''potential rapist'', i treat women just like men, i talk to them like men, i don't put this ''trying to appear good'' facade around a girl anymore, i'm not looking for anything with them anymore . Well since you kind of asked yourself how we go through it, that's just my behaviour towards this whole situation. I kind of lost hope, mariages end up worse and worse as time passes, false sexual allegations, the fact that some women see themselves higher than men (and you can't even tell right away that's the worst) disgusts me to engage anything, because whether or not you're positive about it, it could end up real bad. This puts a huge toll on my mental state, so i just don't bother with this crap.

&#x200B;

If i ever marry a girl, i will have to know everything about her, from a to z, her behaviours etc. at least for several years, and even then there's a chance that she's hiding her intentions the whole time (that's the feeling i get, what my subconscience tells me)

&#x200B;

When i was little, i had several girl friends i used to play with, loved them all, i was so happy to grow up and have a wife etc. even when you're a kid you see life as pink, and that's how it turns out to be...

&#x200B;

that's how it is, i just focus on other stuff, i'm not chasing girls, they will have to come to me, or else, it doesn't matter anyway"

Fitness,eunhh4j,t3_cgqy78,1563928848.0,"Did you cut first or build muscles right away? In your before pic, you look somewhat skinnyfat. That's the dilemma whether you should gain mass or cut. I used to be quite skinny fat (and still am tbh), i pretty much started to cut but even though i made insane strength gain, i still look the same (a little more defined, but it's nothing spectacular). People look surprised when i lift heavier weights than them when i'm not bigger than them. The problem is, as much weight as i'm losing i can't get rid of the fat and don't even weigh that much (60kg for 170cm, about 132,277 lbs for 5.6 ft)

&#x200B;

Should i just build muscles? (since the mass is essentially what i'm lacking), i pretty much still look like your before body with a little bit more definition on the upper body
