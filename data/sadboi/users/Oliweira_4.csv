SoccerBetting,fi18bba,t3_f5wh0b,1582052628.0,">Are small bets such as £1 on evens or around evens a waste to build a small bank? and when would you say the best time to bulk the price up is?

Always choose a stake that you can afford to lose, especially if you're a beginner! 1£ is totally fine.

>I stick to betting on wins only, should I try branching out to other markets or will I be fine making small profits/going evens there?

I think we all started with betting on 1X2 only, I'm sure you'll try out other markets eventually.

>I've been seeing a lot of betting tipsters on twitter and other sites, would it be safe to tail them or is there something i don't know?

Forget twitter tipsters and all that crap, if they truly made big profits with their bets, they wouldn't need to share them. This sub is definitely the best place for advice!
