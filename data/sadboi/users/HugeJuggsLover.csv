Otherwise it was kind of a normal day, I guess. I didn’t really think about killing myself, so that was all right. I’m gonna go outside for a smoke, that will be ok. 

The title really just meant there’s possibility in every new day. There’s no guarantee that it will be good, but there are likely positive things about your life but your depression doesn’t allow you to see them, and that’s ok. 

I know for sure my life could absolutely be worse. I’m not starving, I have a roof over my head. A loving family, some good friends, a few great ones. My life could absolutely be worse, much worse, and yours could, too."

On top of that I recently alienated somebody that I really care about, and that situation isn’t going to ever get better, or at least right now that’s the way it seems. Part of the problem is that she won’t listen to reason, but I did fuck it up, not trying to shift blame. She just doesn’t understand the reality of the situation in some ways. 

Nonetheless, every day has the potential to be good, and that’s coming from someone who is notoriously pessimistic. Even with my current predicament, which is highly unlikely to ever change, I can still see the promise of a new day."

Today was the turning point where everything came to a head and I’m pretty sure that I’ve soured that relationship beyond repair. Only time will tell if I’m right about that, but I’m really unhappy with myself. Things had been starting to get better for me in general, but this is a big setback in my eyes. 

I have a big problem with needing to be liked, and this person’s opinion of me had truly become everything in my world. Now I’ve gone and fucked that up in extraordinary fashion. I’ll recover eventually, but the relationship most likely will not. I don’t really want to get into specifics, because she’s on here somewhere, she’d figure out what this post means either way, but I’d rather not make it obvious to everybody. 

It’s my fault, and she’s rightfully pissed off at me, I might be even more unhappy with myself than she is. I’d be ok if I didn’t wake up tomorrow, but that’s just not going to happen. Oh well, life goes on. I’ll only need to wait another 50 or 60 years to die, I’m certainly not going to do it myself.

Most people on this planet are driven by insecurity, lack of self-worth and fear of judgement. That’s why the majority of people never pursue what they really want to do. 

If you didn’t have to worry about the consequences of failure, what would your dream pursuit be in life? You don’t need to answer me, just answer to yourself. Now, is that the same answer that you’d give to me or anybody else under the presumption of no judgement? I’d wager that it’s not. That’s the anti-self right there. 

The anti-self is cynical, doubtful and hyper-critical of you. We all have that, but some people are much better adjusted and know how to shut that voice out. If you have intrusive thoughts that’s your anti-self. It’s not you. You ARE NOT the negative thoughts. Fuck the negative thoughts. Fuck all that shit. You do you. As long as you’re not hurting others it’s your life to live.

There must be some kind of positive situation in your life, please try to think of it. Even if it’s something small. Do you like sunny days? A specific song? 

There are plenty of things I really enjoy, but when I’m down it’s hard for anything to be enjoyable. Like today, I don’t have work because it’s a slow day for the company, it’s just after 10:30am and I’m still in bed. I shouldn’t be, but here I am. I get lost without obligations to take care of, and while there are consequences for wasting my day, which I’m likely going to, it’s not the same as missing work if I was supposed to be there. 

I’m going to get up now, and I might even venture outside with my dog. Do you have a pet? Do you like animals? Perhaps you should adopt an animal, it may give you a sense of purpose and fulfillment. I know coming home to my happy girl can make a bad day much better. Hang in there, friend."
