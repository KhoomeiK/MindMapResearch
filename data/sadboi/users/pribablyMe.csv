It's ultimately a decision that they have to make, but meds are a big deal. I have two kids, am happily married, and am the breadwinner for the family, and that wouldn't be possible without meds. They're so important. They've allowed my wife to have some time off to work on her depression and spend a lot or of time raising our kids, which is a really big deal. 

A lot of folks won't stay on meds because of the weight gain, and they might miss that feeling you get right before hypomania. So be ready for your SO to put on 30 lbs and be a little more subdued. They're still the same person inside.

Finally, someone said to ask about what triggers them. Stress definitely makes symptoms worse, so that's not a bad idea. But also encourage them to talk to someone, or use an app like Woebot. There's some CBT strategies that can really help a person de-escalate.

Hope this helps, and thanks for supporting a fellow SZA!

So when your parents tell you you're fat, or money is evil, or that you're mean, you hold onto those beliefs like they're the truth, even if you don't realize it.

I know that means that we're profoundly able to fuck up our kids, but it must also mean the opposite: if our kids know we're proud of them, that they're smart, and that they're wonderful, then maybe they'll believe it.
