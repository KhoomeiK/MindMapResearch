EDAnonymous,fp5qyfx,t1_fp5l08l,1588337817.0,"Hello! Thank you for your message. Everything you have written describes me perfectly and I cannot feel more identified with you. I am very sorry for what you are going through, I know it is very difficult because I also live with it every day, but the simple fact of knowing that someone in the world is going through the same situation makes me feel better, and you should feel the same. 
First of all, I am not a psychologist or anything at all, but there is a therapist I have been with who has given me some tips to solve it. At first I did not believe them but I have verified for myself that they work.
For starters, I don't know what your situation is. Are you at a healthy weight? Or do you need to lose weight? When I chew and spit, the same thing happens to me and I can't lose weight. I have investigated that it is because wether you want it or not your body continues absorbing those calories, in addition that it brings problems with teeth (I have many cavities) and digestive (I suffer from colitis).
The advice that my therapist told me, that I have been able to practice are the following:
 1. Try to eat 5 meals a day, but if you don't want to because you feel very full thats OK, at least try to eat three meals a day, and in between meals eat some sugar-free jelly, vegetables or coffee (I usually do that)
2. If you have any diet that you have practiced (low carb or similar) and you feel comfortable with it stick to it. For example, I have noticed that when I don't eat as many carbohydrates, but rather fat (cheese, pork, etc.) I feel better and much less anxious.
3. Exercise (healthy). In my case, before quarantine I started training for a 5km race. I felt better, as I was waking up to exercise every day, and I liked it because I ate when I was hungry (which was very often)
4. Do not eat just to eat, if you feel full but have anxiety eat any of the low calorie snacks that i mentioned . Do not stay without eating anything because then the anxiety accumulates and you will relapse 
5. This is something that I am still trying to do because it is hard for me, but I have noticed that on days when I eat breakfast I feel much less anxious and I can better practice intuitive eating.

What is a fact is that when I restrict myself I end up having the same anxiety that you tell me  you have and I chew and spit continuously. It is important that you do not stop eating.
I also have a calendar in which I mark daily if I chewed and spit  (which is almost every day), but it helps so you can be more aware. If one day I didnt do it., it motivates because I try to maintain my strike 
I hope it helps you"
EatingDisorders,foqceta,t3_g8xug0,1587990026.0,Hi! I have been struggling with this for 5 years now. My therapist says that my ed is also because of issues with my mother. I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit of your experience with that? Sometimes I wonder if it is really because of that
EDAnonymous,fojscgw,t3_g7tth4,1587828367.0,"Omg your post literally describes my whole life for the last 5 years. I dont do any purging, just that. Is has impacted my whole life. You see... my whole family knows and especially my mom has been trying to help me for years by taking me to psychologist and giving me meds, but whenever i try to talk about my feelings she doesnt know how to respond. She is more like a  “ ok. So you dont want to keep doing it: just stop”. Also, she is a good mom but she is rather cold and that badly affects me. 
I sometimes feel like a failure for not being able to stop. I am obsessed with my body image and cant handle putting on a little bit of weight. I dont feel like i cant trust myself around food and everyday i teel myself im going to stop but i end up falling into the same spot. 
Recently, I tried doing the keto diet and helped me for a long time. I actually stopped doing it for about 3 whole weeks and I felt great, but the problem with me is that when i put myself in a position where i cant control what I eat, I end up extremely full and it triggers me 
Some of the health issues I have are colitis ( its terrible!)
I used to feel completely alone because when I searched for ED recovery i noticed that there where no information about people who only chew and spit, but now using reddit I realized that there are a lot of people like us with the same issue 
Please, is there is anything that I can tell you to make you feel better is that YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS. and despite of what others may think, YOU SHOULDNT BE ASHAMED"
EDAnonymous,fo9b8t9,t1_fo9alxq,1587614933.0,"The best advice i can give you is not to try chew and spitting: it's highly addictive and it will not help you loose weight. I have gained by doing it, and it does have health consequences.
I really admire you for giving up gaming, you are an extremely strong person and i have no doubt that you can do anything; you already know you can master your darkest demon :)"
EDAnonymous,fo98zmv,t1_fo98jpx,1587613350.0,"It affects both mentally and physsically. i've had stomach and teeth problems, and it also affects  social life.For me is a way for not gaining weight but it has the opposite result. feelings like guilt and frustration are always there, and also a sense of weakness from not being able to stop something i have been wanting to stop for years"
EDAnonymous,fo966r4,t1_fo8qmkk,1587611463.0,"Thank you for your comment! In my case everyone in my family knows, even my boyfriend. They all support me in their own ways. I think the best we can do in the current situation is to try to plan healthy meals, but it's very hard sometimes. 
Hope you are well as well ❤️"
EDAnonymous,fo95iqj,t1_fo94msl,1587611018.0,You have no idea how much it helps to know that there is somebody out there with the same situation. I've just discovered reddit and i think that it'll help me not to feel that weird. Thank you so much❤️
