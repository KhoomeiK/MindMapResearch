DarkSoulsHelp,fl7r06b,t3_fn28u8,1584907525.0,"1 and 3 are more similar based on story. not gonna lie 2 is really good too, so do whatever you want to. some people say 3 is harder and faster than all three of them, so if you want that then go ahead. dark souls 2 has more flexibility and has way more bosses than 3. (2 has 32 bosses while 3 only has 19 bosses). 2 is also hard in its own way. if you want more co-op then 3 would be good as its newer and played more.

you can always play one of them and then play the other later on. don't stress about it too much :)"
