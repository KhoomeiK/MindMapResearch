just the ones i thought up off the top of my head. hopefully these count as bringing value to the world and will change your mind about him being a dirt bag. if you don‚Äôt know anything about him then maybe don‚Äôt jump to such a harsh conclusion? 

everyone here talks about jumping on the liking X bandwagon but it seems like you‚Äôve just hopped onto the hate X bandwagon here"
FORTnITE,eu17nlk,t1_eu0l1ty,1563362093.0,"no they don‚Äôt, that reward was never guaranteed."
FORTnITE,etzrq6r,t1_etyyph9,1563336079.0,"honestly it sounds like you wasted your time and effort. 

the 2 afks lost out on absolutely nothing because they weren‚Äôt doing anything; they lost out on a potential reward. is about it. you didn‚Äôt even really waste their 10 minutes as they were probably busy doing something else. 

the archeolo jess was farming the whole time so probably got a bunch of resources. again, missed out on a potential reward but at least he has something to show for his time. 

you came out worst by wasting  explosive weapon durability and mats + maybe traps. congrats you played yourself. this is why the game in its current state sucks. no incentive to actually do anything helpful and if anything it‚Äôs more rewarding to the leechers who don‚Äôt have to risk anything to get a reward."
HayDay,etoe79s,t3_ccmut6,1563024934.0,try your best to keep every machine going 24/7. the more stuff you make = the more money you generate. also this is great for slow and steady amounts of xp.

FORTnITE,etaqr0s,t1_etanmc3,1562626733.0,"great suggestion, but unfortunately i am playing other games. it‚Äôs just a shame because this game has so much missed potential which is why i find myself coming back to the game in the hopes that they‚Äôve tried to improve it in the slightest."
FORTnITE,etaqm20,t1_etaqb0g,1562626631.0,i‚Äôd like to think that after so many complaints they‚Äôd start to take their jobs seriously and fix the game or something. one step forwards and two steps back with this company..
FORTnITE,etaqj0g,t1_etapo41,1562626570.0,"nope, 100 ping is kinda bad considering that‚Äôs the only way it‚Äôs possible to play. 100 ping isn‚Äôt even my worst issue lol, i wouldn‚Äôt be complaining as much if that was my only issue. all the rubber banding, microstutters, lag spikes, whatever u want to call them makes the game at points literally unplayable when you‚Äôre trying to accomplish something"
FORTnITE,etaq9tn,t1_etapkt2,1562626385.0,"read the ending, i probably will quit !!!!!!!!!!! i am playing other games !!!!!!! it‚Äôs just a shame because the idea of the game is great, it‚Äôs super disappointing that all the issues with the game overshadow the actual game!!!!!!!"
FORTnITE,etapzme,t1_etapr3m,1562626177.0,"sure it‚Äôs an investment in time/resources but when the community‚Äôs preferred way of playing is to not play that‚Äôs where i see issues. 

anything other than denied husk swarm or whatever it‚Äôs called is isn‚Äôt worth it when you could be afking and still getting rewards. not fun though, very much agreed"

FORTnITE,etano1d,t1_etan0wb,1562624520.0,"thing is, i don‚Äôt have lots of everything. and there still is no compelling reason to grind currently. wargames have been lucrative and what‚Äôs even more lucrative is being able to reap rewards for not playing the game and just sitting watching husks smack away at your walls for 10 minutes."
FORTnITE,etandlb,t1_etan0c1,1562624321.0,"i‚Äôm usually on single digit ping, 100 is horrible. there ain‚Äôt no way i‚Äôm playing if it‚Äôs any higher, 100 is barely bearable. i paid for this game, why should i have to sacrifice my ping as well to actually be able to play how the game was intended to be ?"

FORTnITE,etamc1p,t1_etam8sx,1562623601.0,thanks for telling me ... do u want a medal or something ?
FORTnITE,etam8sk,t1_etam1jz,1562623536.0,i have no clue why i kept playing for so long either. i‚Äôm hoping the game actually progresses somehow with fixes to the game but i‚Äôm not counting on it with epics past updates. it‚Äôs actually so sad that being afk is the best way of ‚Äòplaying‚Äô the game right now.
FORTnITE,etalxrw,t1_etale54,1562623323.0,"i can reduce the time but then that messes with switching from my build menu to my weapons and instead locks me into the edit as long as i‚Äôm close to something i‚Äôve built. 

i have to play na east, it‚Äôs super disappointing that i have to  switch to a different region and be on 100+ ping to even be able to play the game like it was intended to. 

i like the grind, but only when it‚Äôs fun and rewarding. currently it is neither of those two because of all the issues that the devs seem to ignore all too often. my current mission being: ‚Äòcomplete 3 ride the lightning, fight the storm, or fight category 2 storm in a 76+ zone‚Äô only rewarding 200 gold and 7.5k hero xp. it‚Äôs pathetic. then the next mission will be the exact same thing for the exact same rewards. it‚Äôs bland and boring."
