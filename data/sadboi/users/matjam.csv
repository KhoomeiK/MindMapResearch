This is actually probably an attempt to get kunos to actually attempt some level of sanity checking on the data before they relay it. Someone who is able to do this could do things like ... modify their car so it's just 20% better at maintaining grip around corners than possible oand another 10% throttle so they just .. pull away like magic every turn and go into turns way hotter than they should be able to. 

With an appropriate amount of effort you could be basically dominating and people would wonder how you were doing it but nothing you were doing would look completely unreasonable.

My guess is the reason why this guy is just running backwards around the place is he found others doing sneakier hacks and he's just saying ""hay, if you don't fix this, this is whats going to happen ...""."

I still haven't quite settled on what I feel is optimal for me, but I do think it's important to explore carefully and figure out what is best for you - I think the optimized setups you find other people do are great - for their way of driving - but if you expect to download some setup and then go fast then it's not reasonable.

I will say though that just getting consistent tire pressures for the conditions makes a HUGE difference. Running 27.5 PSI tires in SPA gave me several seconds each lap. Pay attention to the track temp and air temps and set up the tires and run 5 or 6 laps and then check the temps again and keep adjusting until it all lines up nicely.

Have a decent CPU, have the latest drivers, OS was reinstalled in the last 6 months and I disable unnecessary services and do all the recommended tweaks that generally you find.
