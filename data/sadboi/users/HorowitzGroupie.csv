After a particularly bad rage episode I was hospitalized and diagnosed bipolar II. Initially I was very skeptical about the diagnosis because I had never had a true manic or hypomanic episode. Then right on schedule about two months after my diagnosis I had my first hypomania. 

Marijuana was what sparked the episode. I had never gotten high before, so I attributed the feelings to weed and not mania. It wasn't until years later that I realized it had been a hypomanic episode.  

So because I was in denial about being bipolar I continued behaving recklessly and within a year had my first true manic episode and was rediagnosed Bipolar I. A year after that I had my first psychotic episode.  

It tends to progress this way which is why it's important to take the medication as a preventative."

benzorecovery,fpq0j4o,t1_fppzm9i,1588812749.0,"What I'd focus on is making sure your doctor is working with you, not against you. So many doctors will try to speed up the taper.

benzorecovery,fp7m3h5,t1_fp6rw3z,1588373216.0,"Each time I cut a mg, it takes about 3 weeks for the symptoms to die down. So I usually cut 1 mg every 4 weeks. It's good to have a week where you feel relatively normal. However if you really wanna plow through it, you can safely drop 1 mg every two weeks. 

With 10 mg pills I like to crush them into a fine powder, mix the powder up quite a bit, then divide them into as many piles as I want. If you make 5 piles, that's 2 mg each. Then I empty out some capsules, for instance vitamins or melatonin, and I push each powder pile into each capsule. So now I have 5 capsules with approximately 2 mg in each one. 6 piles would be 1.6 mg each. 7 piles would be 1.4 mg each etc.

The capsules of course won't be exact, but since Valium has such a long half life you won't really notice the difference."
