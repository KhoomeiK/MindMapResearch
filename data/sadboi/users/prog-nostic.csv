They spend 12 hours outside and 7 hours sleeping, leaving just 5 awake hours at home, let alone actually spend time with their puppers.

Powerful stuff here, dude! True power lies in letting go and moving on. You're well on your way to great things.

You've listed quite a few things here, some of which you're already doing. Keep doing the things you already are and don't bite off more than you can chew.

* Remember that long term consistency always beats short term intensity.
* Start small; doesn't matter how small. Do not fall into the trap of ""this is good, so more is better"" and push yourself to injury.
* Don't expect results in 60 days. Any ad that says *""lose 40 lbs in 2 months""* is either lying or selling you something that's detrimental to your health. Our unrecogniable, unfit bodies didn't transform overnight - it's an accrual of years of unhealthy habits.
* Give yourself plenty of time to recover (2-3 days a week).
* For goodness sake, never compare your day 1 with someone else's day 365.
* You can't outrun a bad diet. What you eat has a 60-70% impact on your journey. See this as a lifestyle change and not just ""something I'm doing for 90 days so I can go back to eating whatever I want"". Just don't go cold turkey on it. Make small adjustments and move towards healthier choices.
* Optional: A little extreme but I would go as far as not looking in the mirror or checking scales for the first 3 months. I covered my mirror so I see only my face."
